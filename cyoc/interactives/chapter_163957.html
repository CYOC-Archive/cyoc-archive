<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hello Jen!”<br />
<br />
Jen blinked and looked at the woman standing before her.   Mrs. Adams.   Yes that was the person’s name.  <br />
<br />
And Jen?  No, her name was Dr Jenkins.   <br />
<br />
The Rottweiler bitch looked up at Mrs. Adams, her mind dazed and foggy, like she’d been asleep for month.   <br />
<br />
“Are you in there Dr Jenkins?”, the woman said sternly.  <br />
<br />
It all started coming back to her.  Images of her past self as a human.  Her deeds.   Her transformation.  Her mating.  Her family.   The it was all a blur.  Oh god her family!   What had happened to them?!<br />
<br />
The woman laughed, clapping her hands.  “Yes you remember!   I can see the intelligence in your eyes!”<br />
<br />
The woman pet her between the ears, which felt oddly soothing.  She felt her tail wag.   Yes, she had a tail.   But she was human, was she not?<br />
<br />
“It’s been over two years,” Mrs Adams explained, “I grew tired of visiting a stupid mindless dog.   After all, what’s the point of a punishment if you don’t know you’re being punished?”<br />
<br />
The flood of memories was overwhelming.   But one sinking fear dominated the Rottweiler’s thoughts.   Her family.  What had happened to her family?<br />
<br />
As if reading the fear on her face, Mrs Adams answered, “Are you worried about your wife and children?”   To which Jen whimpered.   <br />
<br />
“I assure you they are fine.  In fact, I’ve prepared you a presentation to get you up to speed”.  The woman flipped a button on a remote in her hand, and a big screen tv on the wall behind her flipped to life.  To the bitch’s horror, the screen was split into three.  They showed footage of her family.  Her family changing.  The memories rushed back, all like bad dream.  But it was very real.<br />
<br />
Jen whimpered as she watched her family transform into dogs.  Her son Liam had transformed into a German Shepherd, while her daughter Melissa had been turned into a Great Dane.   Finally, his sweet innocent wife Abby had become a Golden Retriever.<br />
<br />
Like her, they had all clearly lost their human minds.   And thank goodness.   It was the one mercy Mrs Adams had afforded them, for the following images showed the humiliations they endured.   <br />
<br />
Images and images followed one another showing Liam mating with bitches.  She lost count with how many different partners.   Mrs Adams taunted that he had sired hundreds of puppies.  <br />
<br />
The the most heart-wrenching images were those of his wife and daughter.  If dog could cry she would have, but all she could do was whine as she was forced to watch photos and the occasional video clip of both being fucked by males, followed by their pregnancies and birth.   She wanted to look away but she couldn’t as she had a desperate need to know.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness they didn’t know what they were doing, she kept telling herself.  They even seemed to be happy.  Finally the video ended. <br />
<br />
Mrs Adams smiled with a cruel face, “After the first year I got bored.  It cost quite abit to convince all your new owners to sell you back to me.”<br />
<br />
With a flip of the remote the screen turned on.  It showed two golden retrievers going at it.  But something was wrong.  The female was terrified, the eyes of her whites showing.  Intelligent.  And sad.<br />
<br />
The horror of the truth dawned on Jen just as Mrs Adams explained, “Abby was first.   So innocent and unaware of your crimes.  After returning her mental capacities I made her understand what you did.  All the people you hurt.  So she would know why this was happening to you.  And why this was happening to her and her children”<br />
<br />
Jen could only cower as she watched the video clip flip to her wife giving birth to her first litter.  The heartbreaking look in Abby’s eyes were piercing.  <br />
<br />
The video flipped again. This time showing Mrs Adams holding Abby’s head, forcing her to watch two Great Danes...   and like before the female was all too unwilling, all too terrified.<br />
<br />
It was like the ground fell out from beneath Jen.  Cruelly, the woman elaborated, “You precious daughter was next to get the treatment.”<br />
<br />
For the next several minutes Jen was treated to a sequence of videos of his wife and daughter being bred by dogs.  Over and over.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a clanking sound.  Jen turned her head to the left.  A door in the wall opened up.  <br />
<br />
Slowly and cautiously two animals entered.  A Great Dane and a Golden Retriever.  His wife and daughter! <br />
<br />
 <br />
Their heads were held low, tails tucked between their legs.  They wouldn’t look at her.  If it was from shame or resentment, Jen couldn’t tell.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been planning this family reunion for the last several month”, Mrs Adams said, motioning to someone outside the door.   <br />
<br />
Moments later another dog was let in on a leash This time male.  A handsome German Shepard.  Liam!<br />
<br />
But unlike the bitches he held his tail up high.  Tail wagging excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Yes it’s your son.  He’s happy to see you!   But not because he recognizes any of his family.  But because he hasn’t had a bitch in weeks!”<br />
<br />
To her horror Jen saw the wildness in her son’s eyes.   Was he aware at all in there?  <br />
<br />
But worse than that, she couldn’t miss the obviously erect penis he was sporting, as he sniffed the air to catch the scent of the three females.<br />
<br />
“Have fun!” Mrs Adams said cheerfully, as she left the room and shut the door behind her with a foreboding clang.</p>
