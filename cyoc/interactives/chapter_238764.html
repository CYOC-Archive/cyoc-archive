<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pensive, Patrick tapped a finger against his cheek as he stared at the screen. Wondering if maybe the problem was he&#39;d gone too big with his last change, he reached out to take hold of the mouse and move the pointer. Scrolling through his profile, thinking if he was to transform anything about himself, it probably was best to start off simple.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot; he asked himself.<br />
<br />
His arm brushing against the towel, and in the process the fake breasts of the swimsuit-style bodysuit, an idea came to him. Standing, he shucked off and tossed the towel into the hamper. Moving the chair away from the desk, he activated the cameras and entered a series of commands. The Chronivac scanning him again, he read how it took in account his altered appearance whilst listing the bodysuit as an article of clothing. Sitting back down, not sure how to take what he saw, yet feeling it was somehow important, he moved mouse and scrolled down, stopped, leaned back, and tapping a finger against his cheek, he let his mind wander.<br />
<br />
The biggest question he had was how simple. Subtracting body hair, leaving only what was on his head and two thin eyebrows, something told him this was too simple. Thinking, not wanting to go so far as last time, where he&#39;d altered large portions of himself as well as also had ended up changing reality and how people perceived him, Patrick felt any transformation in reality was inevitable.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so, I need to balance it out somehow,&quot; he reasoned as he searched through the menus and other bits of information, trying to work out what was best to alter.<br />
<br />
Mind going to how he looked when he saw himself reflected in the mirror, he glanced down at what he had on. An idea coming to him, he navigated to a specific area of his profile. Entering the section dealing with his height and weight, Patrick dropped his height down to five foot four, set it so this was as tall as he&#39;d ever get, corrected his weight so it was now one hundred and twenty-three, what he felt was equal and appropriate for how tall he&#39;d be, and after some thought, made his face rounder, feminine, gave his waist a slight pinched appearance, whilst his hips, butt and thighs he made smidge more pronounced. Setting it so only he&#39;d be aware of the changes, he also lowered the discomfort, which he noted raised the sexual pleasure he&#39;d feel if he saved and confirmed the new reality.<br />
<br />
Uncertain if this was too much of a change, he hovered the pointer over the button to save and commit the transformation, but didn&#39;t click on it. Glancing down, he wondered what would happen if he still had on the bodysuit if he did click on the icon. Conflicted, thinking he probably ought to take off the thing before doing anything, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to as he asked himself, &quot;What if I go through with this, and discover the thing doesn&#39;t fit me any longer. I&#39;ll have to change back to wear it, or accept I wasted my money.&quot;<br />
<br />
At a loss as to what he should do, Patrick stared down at the pert B cup breasts. Watching as they moved ever so slightly as he breathed in and out, he decided after some time whatever he did, he&#39;d have to take the bodysuit off before his mom came home. Figuring she wouldn&#39;t understand, still unable to bring himself to talk to her about what he&#39;d learned about himself, feeling it somehow wasn&#39;t right, Patrick was about to stand and take the thing off, but instead looked back at the laptop screen. Deciding he&#39;d come this far, he navigated to the section dealing with the hair on his hair, selected from the drop-down menu &#39;Tousled Pixie Cut&#39; then, before he could talk himself out of what he was about to do, Patrick clicked the icon to save and commit the changes, making sure they&#39;d be permanent unless he reverted them back or altered them further.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to expect, what did happen wasn&#39;t what he thought would. Starting as a slight pleasant sensation in his groin, he gasped and pushed away from the desk when it suddenly spiked. Spreading his legs, he squatted down and having no clue what to do, he proceeded to first use the palm of his hand to massage the front of his groin, pushing so his cock ended up rubbing in a sensual manner. After some time, when it was clear this wasn&#39;t helping, he slipped a hand between his legs, and after fiddling about with the genitalia area of the bodysuit, he settled on a method which was a combination message against the silicon vulva as well as using two fingers to slip into the silicon vagina to press every so often until, with another gasp, he felt himself climax. Feeling a few seconds later something warm, sticky and viscous coat his hand, he understood he&#39;d cummed and it had shot through the catheter, and discovering this was a turn on, liking how it made the fake vulva feel even more realistic, he continued on until he climaxed a second time.<br />
<br />
In all his life, he&#39;d never managed to do what he&#39;d done, and feeling sated, he sighed. Realising at some point he&#39;d dropped so he was down on his knees, with his free hand pressed firm against the floor, he forced himself to stand. Legs wobbly, he glanced down at himself, at the hand he&#39;d used to masturbate with, and with a sigh, headed for the upstairs bathroom. There, he didn&#39;t even bother taking off the bodysuit as he climbed under the shower, where he first washed himself wearing, then, removing it, washed himself again, then it. Finishing, he drapped it over the shower curtain and climbed out of the tub.<br />
<br />
Before the mirror, he wiped off the build-up of steam and peered at his reflection. Seeing a face which looked more female, he glanced down at himself. Seeing how the programme had transformed his body as he&#39;d instructed, he sighed and wished he could have seen how he looked before he&#39;d taken off the bodysuit. Peering at the mirror, he ran a hand through his transformed hair, reached for a towel and dried himself off. Thinking about what he&#39;d done, he wondered if he ought to leave himself the way he now was or turn himself back as it came to him he was now two inches shorter than his mother. Glancing over at the bodysuit dripping onto the edge of the tub, conflicted, still unsure exactly what he hoped to accomplish by owning it, by using the Chronivac with it, Patrick knew he&#39;d eventually put it back on. Wrapping the towel around his torso, he grabbed the thing off the shower curtain, another towel, and headed back to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
There, he dried off the bodysuit as best as he could, then left it lying on the towel on his bed to air dry the rest of the way. Dressing himself, he wasn&#39;t the least surprised to discover his clothes had morphed to accompany his new body, and smiling, he muttered, &quot;Probably should have figured the bodysuit would do the same,&quot; as he used the towel he had wrapped around himself to clean up the few spots on the floor from his sudden need to sexually self-relieve himself.<br />
<br />
Finished, he sat down in front of his laptop and pulled up his profile. Looking it over, he soon asked himself, &quot;How long do I want to remain the way I am? Or should I leave myself this way?&quot; and having no answer, he absently began to tap a finger against his cheek.</p>
