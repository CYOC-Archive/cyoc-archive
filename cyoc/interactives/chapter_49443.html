<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bart was actually sitting on top of the desk, looking rather cute as he wrote stuff down, but <br />
hearing some of the details of the game made him look up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only five people at once?&quot; Bart said, &quot;That's no good... and the game can only be played <br />
up to a mile or two outside Glendale's city limits? ... That's going to make things very <br />
harder...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not need be!&quot; Jenny said, &quot;Remember it said only that da asker's turn was wasted if they <br />
tried ta use their turn -outside- of Glendale. That means that we can still likely call people <br />
outside da town and invoke da game.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bart nodded, &quot;Risky ta test but something we gotta need'ta know.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kevin giggled, &quot;That's funny,&quot; Reading another part of the page again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The part about the witch trials Master Dad.&quot; Kevin pointed standing up in the chair he was <br />
in. &quot;People who were accused of being witches were usually the rich and powerful and land <br />
owners were only burned at the stake if they DIDN'T confess.&quot; Kevin sounded proud at <br />
knowing that little fact. <br />
<br />
Jensen looked at that part again, 'Since it says the wtiches were killed on the spot, maybe <br />
these people really were witch hunters who knew what they were dealing with and weren't <br />
just some bitter lower class urchins wanting to get back at the upper class.' <br />
<br />
Jensen looked over the page himself and saw a series of typos.  Jensen could also tell, <br />
from the way the web page was written up, that the writer had been a completely amateur <br />
programmer (Jennifer had charmed enough computer geeks into being her programming <br />
tutor for free to tell the different levels of skill involved in web design).   <br />
<br />
And the date at the bottom (not even done in the website current type style) showed <br />
indeed it hadn't been updated since Glendale had gone on-line. In other words, all the <br />
information on here was out of date or simply wasn't taken seriously by the people <br />
currently who worked and maintained the website. <br />
<br />
In other words, whoever had done this ancient web page had known the game was real and <br />
it's history, but the web page's entire style and lay out seriously reminded Jensen of the <br />
same web pages that swore that the Moon landing was fake, Bush had knocked down the <br />
towers, and that hurricane Katrina was caused by secret weather controlling nanits. <br />
<br />
So in other words there were people in Glendale who knew the game was real, but was <br />
often passed over by other the majority of people, existing only as an urban legend.  At <br />
least this meant Jensen didn't have to worry about a 'Transform or Dare' special police unit <br />
banging on their doors. <br />
<br />
Kevin wondered aloud, &quot;I wonder if da game will still be around if Glendale got renamed or <br />
got disbanded?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart sighed and threw a drawing he had over his shoulder, &quot;So much for Wolvesdale.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Bart.&quot; Jenny patted him on the shoulder, &quot;It said 'currently limited' meanin' <br />
maybe we can expand it somehow. And Yer smart, you'll think of somethin'.&quot; Jenny batter <br />
her eyelashes at her brother. <br />
<br />
Indeed Bart did. The wolf cub prodigy coming to much the same conclusion Kaylee had, <br />
'We gotta figure out a way ta phrase a Transform that'll create new wolves without relyin' <br />
on da game!' <br />
<br />
Jensen wondered a bit more about the person who wrote the web page. And thought again <br />
to 'Kathy' who apparently had Dared Kyle. Some had acted like her with ears and tail were <br />
normal and didn't understand why the principle had called her about them on that day or <br />
any day, while some indeed did brush it off as a costume.  <br />
<br />
Of course since he didn't know the precise details of Kathy's transformation, having only <br />
some people brush it off might have been some of the details. And his parents and <br />
Kaylee's parents had decidedly recognized the wolf beasts as things that were unnatural, <br />
though the average joe on the street had payed them almost no mind at all! Not over the <br />
fact they were wolves, not over the fact they were naked. Of course, Kyle's Transform <br />
hadn't included anything about people's perceptions or reality itself.  <br />
<br />
Jensen had no idea if what powered the game was non-sentient magic the witches had <br />
used or some spirits of chaos that heard anyone who invoked the game. Well, if it worked <br />
it worked. <br />
<br />
The web page also more or less confirmed for Jensen what Kaylee had also thought about, <br />
that nearly all who had played the game before had used it for petty and small minded <br />
motives and goals, it had been such an odd little thing none of them had actually -<br />
THOUGHT- to use such simplistic rules to their full potential. Jensen felt his head swell <br />
ever so slightly that he had taken things to the next level. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bart.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen didn't react to his former father addressing him as father, it simply felt right and in <br />
a way perhaps was right now.  &quot;Make a note, when we use the transform on Martha, to <br />
include a shift in reality and shift people's perceptions except for her memories and the <br />
other the wolf pack members. I want to see if records and photos change along with <br />
people's perception of reality. I have something special for her in particular in mind.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bart bowed his head from his eagle style sitting spot, &quot;Yes Master Dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen also thought, 'Could the game even do a transformation of -fate- so the <br />
transformee was always someone else's child? That would also be an experiment worth <br />
doing.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Marcy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master Dad?&quot; the wolf girl asked eager to be of use and have something to do in the <br />
stuffy relatively boring office. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've got something special for you to do later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh? What is it, whatisit-?!&quot; Marcy jumped up and down her claws clicking on the wood.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a surprise. But we're gonna see if we can use the game to make friends a whole lot <br />
easier.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO-KAY!&quot; Marcy nodded happy that her father and master had something important <br />
for her to do. <br />
<br />
It would involve ultimately a white trunk in the garage with dark tinted windows and a <br />
quick trip the park looking for a child a safe distance from their parents for Marcy to <br />
contact and ask the game of. And then check to she how far the alterations had gone to <br />
see if the mother still recognized their own child or not after a transform (he trusted in <br />
Marcy eventually being able to sweet talk a kid into answering transform eventually). <br />
<br />
Of course, if a child another made into a wolf child who had always been a wolf child of <br />
Kaylee and Jensen, wouldn't that rewrite reality so THEY had always been wolf beasts? But <br />
then how would have Kyle's Transform have happened? Or did that even matter anymore <br />
now that round of the game was done? <br />
<br />
Jensen growled lowly at how little he knew about the subject at hand, he didn't like it ever <br />
when someone pointed that out or something made him feel that way. <br />
<br />
On the bright side, if it did work, he could invite his friends over, and transform or dare <br />
them into she-wolves, and their families would never miss them. <br />
<br />
Jensen got the impression the witches when they were executed didn't give a frick about <br />
how much havoc or how far spread their final curse could become, or... maybe they had <br />
hoped that one day someone like Jensen would come along, oh well, who was to know? <br />
<br />
&quot;Master! We're back!&quot; Kaylee declared coming back into the office. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mission accomplished!&quot; The twins nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now everyone take a look at this.&quot; Jensen took the screen and turned it around to <br />
face the she-wolves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's the one.&quot; Kaylee said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze.&quot; Said Fran, &quot;Some towns take their local legends way too seriously.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee, Jensen, and the cubs all looked at each other then back at the twins. <br />
<br />
Kevin with a deadpan look on his face scrolled up a few inches. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! This is about the game that let us become twins!&quot; Darla declared.<br />
<br />
The twins with identical sheepish looks on their faces grinned embraced their ears flat on <br />
their heads and their tails low. <br />
<br />
&quot;One thing da web page proves if it's true,&quot; Bart said, &quot;Is that we could dare someone inta <br />
becomin' a solid gold statue, or a goose that lays goldin' eggs. Da problem of course is <br />
figirin' out what we could create with the da game that da tax men wouldn't be askin' too <br />
hard of where it came from!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny said then, &quot;We shouldn't transform someone inta somethin' dat's just a one time <br />
windfall, we'd lose that particular branch of the game forever and we'd not have it as a <br />
renewable resources. And it might damage da gold standard if we started floodin' da <br />
market.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya right sis'.&quot; Bart nodded. &quot;Straight cash is out, no one would ask where art came from, <br />
but like ya said, we shouldn't make it ah one time deal.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hearing two kids (even two wolfen kids) talk about the business world in such innocent yet <br />
sophisticated voices was in it's own way more disorienting then the twins' unity. <br />
<br />
Kevin then injected, &quot;Maybe we should Dare business men into givin' us dere net prophets?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny looked at Kevin like he was 'special.' They said together through no side <br />
effect of magic:  &quot;Dummy, ya ALWAYS ask for da percentage of da gross!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Kevin meekly replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now play nice kids.&quot; Kaylee said nicely but firmly at the same time. <br />
<br />
The cub quickly settled down before they even got settled up. <br />
<br />
Bart had Kevin print out the web page... just to be on the safe side Jensen held it up the <br />
light and folded it a few times just to make sure there wasn't so crazy ass spell engraved <br />
into the text or something... more insane things had happened that day after all. <br />
<br />
Bart continued to work by himself, while Kevin and Jenny continued to net research, while <br />
Marcy for the most part was her father's shadow. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what's up next Master?&quot; Kaylee leaned against her master's side, and the took another <br />
side and the backside pushing their bodies against him. The wolf cubs didn't react <br />
negatively to this sight in the least. <br />
<br />
Jensen however, while feeling himself very excited said, &quot;There is still much -much- to do. <br />
Bart, Jenny, I'll be taking the master bedroom now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master Father.&quot; They said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marcy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Start taking my stuff from my old bedroom to the master bedroom. My old room is first <br />
floor west wing second door on the right. The master bedroom is on the second floor, <br />
west wing, last door on the right. Dumb the play girl magazines and boy band posters in <br />
the garbage. I'll toss out whatever I don't want out of the master bedroom myself later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.&quot; Kaylee suggest, &quot;Let the older cubs sell off their old stuff on ebay, if we're going <br />
to expand the size of the pack we'll need some... what's the word?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Capital.&quot; Bart said nothing look up from his writing and doodling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right capital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, &quot;Fine, but don't get ahead of ourselves, we need to deal with the estate's <br />
staff first, otherwise we'll just trip over ourselves.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master/Dad.&quot; The entire pack said. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Kids, you can have my old room, there's also another unused bedroom right next to it. <br />
Feel free to do what you want with both you're free to work out who sleeps where unless <br />
you get too rowdy for Kaylee's tastes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes father/master dad.&quot; They said together.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee, girls, you'll be sharing the master bedroom with me of course. The bed was <br />
always oversized for my parents would should fit us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure master.&quot; The twin bowed grinning as Kaylee also just grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao!&quot; Kevin said surprised. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kaylee asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just found da page on gray wolves.... they're not endangered in the least but... whao.&quot; <br />
Kevin turned the screen around again and showed it off.  It showed an image map, and the <br />
territories of gray wolves from what they once were was cut over by half. In countries like <br />
Japan they were simply non-existent also in almost all of Europe all the U.S. of A. except <br />
Alaska and forget Africa. <br />
<br />
Like Kevin said, gray wolves weren't endangered technically, but seeing the kingdom of <br />
their witless empty headed four legged cousins considerably reduced still struck a cord in <br />
all the Big Bad Wolves present. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Don't worry son.&quot; Jensen said patting Kevin on the head, &quot;We'll do something about that <br />
too eventually... but first, go check out your new room with your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whao kay!&quot; Kevin instantly jumped down and follow Marcy to Jennifer's former room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Said Jenny taking over at the computer, &quot;Maybe if Ah can manage ta buy some <br />
more of da land behind da estate, we can expand it enough ta have our free range herd of <br />
prey animals fer da pack... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat's a big if.&quot; Bart commented still drawing up plans. <br />
<br />
Jenny nodded while typing, &quot;Just plannin' ahead.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen and Kaylee both felt a sense of pride at seeing the two elder cubs working as busy <br />
as bees for the pack's future. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know Master, we'll have to have to get some larger beds for the master bed room <br />
when we add to the pack.&quot; Kaylee said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know dear, I know.&quot; Jensen said stroking Kaylee's breast with one hand and Darla's rear <br />
with another while Fran nuzzled under his chin.  &quot;Oh and Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After we've transformed or dared all the staff, you can start ripping off as many of the <br />
inside doors as you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you master!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen looked at the sun, it was only mid afternoon, school would only now be getting <br />
out. <br />
<br />
Marcy rushed back into the office holding a pink cellphone, it was beeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this is for you dad.&quot; Marcy held up the phone. <br />
<br />
Jersen reluctantly broke up the she-wolves and carefully picked up the phone in his now <br />
much larger hands and delicately pressed the 'speak' button. And listened in, <br />
<br />
He spoke in reply, &quot;Oh...hey Bianca... oh I have a REALLY REALLY bad sore throat, I'm <br />
gonna be out of it for a bit, so can you tell the others not to worry? I'll get better soon I <br />
promise. But I really shouldn't be talking and I very sure I'm contagious and trust me this <br />
isn't the kind of sickness ya want as an excuse for off of school...so yeah, don't call, and <br />
don't come until I call you and the rest.&quot; There was a VERY cute laugh at the other end and <br />
quick question asked in jest. &quot;No Bianca I promise I haven't turned into a vampire.&quot; Jensen <br />
chuckled. Marcy and Jenny -had- to giggle at that. The cell phone didn't pick up the noise <br />
however thankfully. &quot;All right, see ya soon enough and remember to tell the others before <br />
they come over here and come down with the plague, bye.&quot; Jensen hung up the phone and <br />
handed it back to Macy and rubbed her hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're a good girl Marcy, a very very good girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you master dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now run back to your brother you little scamp you have a lot to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master dad.&quot; Marcy was gone in a blur. <br />
<br />
Jesen walked, ever so slightly slower with the bandaged leg. <br />
<br />
&quot;How long do you think you're going to be sweet heart?&quot; Kaylee asked Bart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah'll have everythin' finalized in time for ya an' father mastah ta review an' me time ta <br />
revise it for ya after ya review it before the ground staff gets here tomorrow an' Martha an' <br />
da rest so we'll have plenty of time ta set up for'em.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay dear.&quot; Kaylee, &quot;I'm sure it'll be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mom alpha female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee started, but while as she been created she was loyal to her master still beyond <br />
question, she still felt a strange sense of fear, happiness, worry and pride, at being <br />
addressed so. It also made Fran and Darla a tiny bit envious and eager for when they'd <br />
have cubs fathered by the Master to call their own as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dang I forgot.&quot; Kaylee said. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot to tell the cubs I'd set up the wii for me after we finished setting up the house <br />
Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins and Jensen groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
'Still as dense as Kyle sometimes.' Jensen thought.</p>
