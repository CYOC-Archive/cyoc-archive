<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">the slutty pig girl, complete with short blonde hair, pierced nipples, and voluptuous figure that people idolized all over Chaturbate. But she feels like she&#39;s ready. Alexandra can remember the faithful day when she became Alexa.<br />
<br />
           Jasmine and her friends “The Piglets,” were over by the Juice Shack at the mall, drinking an Orange Supreme. Alexandra, meanwhile, sat a bench about three yards away from them. She had just finished her “back to school” book and clothing shopping and had just enough money for a snack at the food court. Just as she was scarfing down her chill dog, she felt a squishy impact. She looked up. Jasmine. <br />
	“What do you want, hoe?” she asked. She looked down at her shirt she recently bought at the Forever 21, now covered with beans and tomato. She gasped and glared. Jasmine was about the same height as Alexandra, but she loomed over like she was her boss. Melissa whispered something into her ear and pointed at the chill dog Alexandra was holding. She gasped louder and slammed it down onto the dirty mall floor.<br />
	“Don’t you know that’s cannibalism?” she snorted. Alexandra said nothing. <br />
“Come girls.” Jasmine gestured to the others. “Forever 21’s waiting for us again. Lousy nerd ruining my shirt.” They all turned and walked in the opposite direction, their asses and tittes swaying as they went along. Kayla’s left boob hit Alexandra in the face. “Watch it nerd.” As soon as they were out of eavesdrop, Alexandra went to the nearest bench and sighed.<br />
<br />
For years, Alexandra had idolized over the Piglets. She even kept a photo of them in her locker like they were a boy band. She didn’t even know why she wanted to be them, they were just a bunch of pigs. Her parents owned some of the most hideous looking pigs even and besides, most people would call teenage girls with snouts and curly tails unattractive. But something about the Piglets figures seemed to attract the boys at school. And it wasn’t just their looks either. They were very confident and didn’t give a fuck. No wonder they were the best cheerleaders in school. Alexandra’s cheerleader audition on the other hand told a different story. While she had taken gymnastics as a child, she couldn’t muster the energy to do a cartwheel. Aside from that, her pale skin didn’t match the white and gold uniform, and its oversized nature had her look lanky. She spent the rest of that afternoon sulking. Alexandra really wanted to join the Piglets. Who cares if they badmouthed everyone at school. It would be nice to have some friends for a change. Someone who’d care for you.<br />
<br />
“No.” Alexandra got up from the bench. “I’m not just going to sit here and let those bimbos walk all over me. I’m going to walk with them!” <br />
“I’M GETTING A MAKEOVER!” And it was only then when she realized that last thought actually formed into words. Everyone stared at her.<br />
“Howzabout I fix that mouth shut if you don’t shut the hell up!” a gruff man over at the hot dog stand shouted.<br />
Alexandra got away from the food court as fast as she could. Then, she started her quest through the mall. All of the places she went to charged too much for what she wanted. Hell, her savings wouldn’t be enough to cover plastic surgery at the hospital.<br />
She stopped in front of a store she’d never seen before. A giant sign above read Furoryx with the “y” extended into a fox’s tail. Looked very hip. Hip? Was that the right word? Sexy? Nah. Bitchin’? Regardless, Alexandra went in.<br />
To her surprise, no one else was there. She went up to the pink and black counter and ran the bell. “Hello?”<br />
“Just a sec.” A woman came out of the backroom and in the front of the desk. She looked certainly older than Alexandra, probably around her 50s. She wore a pink buttoned up shirt and long white pants with a big belt wrapped around. She had a big mole on her right cheek that her orange and white fur couldn’t hide. Alexandra noticed that when the woman walked out, her tail, unlike Jasmine who pulled her pants a little down to expose her curly tail, had a hole cut in the back of her pants for her long fluffy tail.<br />
The woman looked at Alexandra. “Can I help you dear?” she asked in a monotone voice?<br />
“Uh,” she stammered, “I’m Alexandra.”<br />
“Vix,” said Vix. “Now what do you want.”<br />
“Uh,” Alexandra stammered again, “A makeover.”<br />
“You have an appointment?”<br />
“No, I’ve just heard of this place like when I walked past.”<br />
“Well, goodbye.” Vix gestured towards the door.<br />
“Bu…” <br />
“Come back when you have made an appointment. Goodbye, come again.”<br />
Alexandra sighed and walked out of the store. She tried very hard not to cry. There are other salons at the mall after all. Maybe she’ll find one there.<br />
“Kid wait.” Alexandra turned around. Vix was there, gesturing to her. She froze in place. “Did I stutter? Come on.”<br />
<br />
<br />
	“What’s up?”<br />
	Alexandra looked up. “What?”<br />
	“Kid, I spent my 30s working as a therapist. I know when someone’s troubled. I can talk over your problems for free.”<br />
	“Are you sure it’s fine?” Alexandra asked.<br />
	“Of course,” said Vix, “I want to do my best to help people, whether it’s a look or something or other.”<br />
	“Okay,” Alexandra took a deep breath. “Have you ever heard of Jasmine Nye?”<br />
	“You mean that ‘socially influenced’ slutty hoe?” asked Vix.<br />
	“Uhh, yeah.”<br />
	“What about her?”<br />
	“Well, I want to be like her and her friends.” Alexandra said.<br />
	“Why?”<br />
	“Well,” Alexandra sniffed. She placed her head in Vix’s lap, “Well, because I want to be sexy and friends with them!” Here come the waterworks.<br />
	“Darling, darling,” Vix stroked ALexandra’s head, “You don’t need them, you’re better off without them.”<br />
	“No I’m not!” she shouted. “Everyday I wished I was someone. Someone confident, someone strong, someone social.”<br />
“Sweetie, don’t cry,” Vix said, “You are someone. I know who you are.”<br />
“But not everyone else.”<br />
Vix thought for a second. “Okay then,” she said, “I have an idea.” She got up and started walking towards the back.<br />
“Where are we going?” asked Alexandra. “Just follow me.” said Vix.<br />
In the back was a large red stage curtain. Vix pulled it back to reveal another room. This room was decorated in checkered tiles. The only piece of furniture was a deluxe red carpeted chair and a simple stool.<br />
The two women stepped inside and Vix closed the curtain. “What are you going to do?” Alexandra asked nervously.<br />
“I’m going to give you that makeover.” said Vix. “But, but the appointment.” Alexandra said.<br />
“Kid, you need this more than anything.”<br />
“Okay, so how is this going to work?”<br />
“Well, I’m going to give you exactly what you want. I’m going to make you Jasmine.”<br />
Alexandra gasped. “No, I can’t steal someone else’s identity.”<br />
“No, no, no,” said Vix. “You’re like a puzzle, missing a few pieces. I’m going to give you those pieces that Jasmine has, and then everyone can see the real you.”<br />
“You’re going to make me into a sexy pig girl like Jasmine?”<br />
“Yes, but I’m going to let you keep your flaws. You may not know this but they’re an important part of who you are. Without them, you’re not you.”<br />
“I guess.”<br />
“BUT,” Vix held up a clawed finger. “I must have your absolute consent in order for me to do this. Do I have your consent?”<br />
Alexa thought about all the times at school where she would get shunned by the Piglets and to just this morning where her chili dog ruined her idol’s new shirt. Something inside of her was preventing her from hating those nasty girls. She knew that she was meant to join.<br />
“Yes, you do.” she said, with the most confidence she ever had. “Let’s do this.”<br />
<br />
Alexandra instantly regretted it. Did she really have to make a fool of herself, lying naked on this chair in the middle of the room? Sure, only Vix would see her, but it’s still too much. No, she gave Vix her consent. There was no turning back.<br />
Vix came out with a bag full of supplies. She’d asked Alexandra to take off her clothes, including her glasses, and lie flat on her back, arms to her side, and facing the ceiling. And under no circumstances should she ever cover up her body.<br />
She pulled out the first item of the back. It was a pink bottle. “What’s that?” Alexandra asked. She couldn’t make out what the label said.<br />
“This will help you with your skin.” Vix replied. <br />
Although her vision was fuzzy, she could make out the bottle’s purple cork, which was shaped to look like a pig’s snout. How cute.<br />
A clear sparkly liquid shot out of the bottle and onto Vix’s paws. She rubbed them together and started to rub them on Alexandra’s belly.<br />
“Ah! Cold!” yelped Alexandra. But then suddenly, it started to get warmer. Very warm. Warm enough to take her back into her childhood at her parent’s farm. She would always play horsey in the fields with her father and pick and bake apple pie with her mother. <br />
But then the feeling took a different turn. An urge kicked in, one that says. “Hello world! It’s me!”<br />
Alexandra then realized that her skin was now oily smooth and pink. The sweat that trickled from her body smelled like bacon.<br />
“What’s cooking?”<br />
“Alright, dear,” Vix said, kneeling down in front of Alexandra, “Now let&#39;s soften up those lady bits.” She took another squirt of the lotion and submerged it into Alexandra’s pussy.<br />
A switch had been flicked into Alexandra’s brain at first contact. This...felt...GOOD! She felt like a goddess, like she deserved all of this. She moaned. She could feel her body growing, but only in certain parts. Her tits started to bulge and her ears began to sharpen. <br />
“Aww, fuck!” she snorted. “Fuck, yes, yes, yes, yes, YES!” She could feel herself getting chubbier while maintaining her skinny body. Her fingers gained some fat and her nose began to shift until her nostrils were sticking out into a snout.<br />
Suddenly, Vix stopped. “Wha, what?” Alexandra, still horny broke out the trace. “Why’d you stop?”<br />
“Turn over,” Vix said, “You need a gorgeous ass.”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Alexandra said, doing exactly as she’s told.<br />
With more lotion on her hands, Vix slapped the ass. It began to jiggle as it expanded. A poke came from the collarbone. Alexandra knew what it was. It was her cute sexy curly tail.<br />
Vix worked her way from the ass to the soles of Alexandra’s feet. She felt them start to harden, knowing that they’ll become Jasmine’s sexy hooves. <br />
Then it stopped. “Okay, darling. Sit up.” Vix pulled out a pair of scissors, hair bleacher, and blonde dye. In just five minutes, Alexandra had become a long straight brunette to a short pixie style blondie.<br />
Vix pulled out a packet of silver ringed piercings. With careful position, she placed one on Alexandra’s pussy, two with a pearl into each of her nipples and a special diamond earring.<br />
It was time for some make up. Black eyeliner made her brows stand out. The blue eye shadowing matches her new blue eyes. Her eyelashes got a curl and mascara job, and the red lipstick was as fiery hot as her new pussy. The pedicure on her nails and hooves were outstanding and the purple fingernails were a nice touch.<br />
“There’s only one thing left to do.” Vix said, and pulled at the final thing in her bag. Alexandra, who can now see clearly, knew what it was, and knew that it was what she needed.<br />
She took the pink dildo and got to work. She was sexy, she was strong, she was confident.<br />
She breathed harder. She gasped. Her pleasure meter was going haywire! But she didn’t care. She oinked. She squealed<br />
She was…, she was…,<br />
<br />
The only thing that Alexandra remembered after cumming all over the red chair and waking up in afterglow was a faint and the words “Alexa,” that trickled out of her mouth. Somehow, that’s who she was now, Alexa.<br />
No customers had come into the store yet, so she walked up out of the curtains and up to the mirror to finally get a good look at herself.<br />
There she was. Alexandra pinched herself to see if this was a dream, but as the finger sunk into her chubby flesh, she knew it was really real. Vix did it. Somehow, she got everything that Alexandra had always wanted. She found her calling card, Alexa.<br />
Alexa studied her figure once more. She knew Vix worked effortlessly, but the attention to detail would make her think otherwise. Her butt and boobs weren’t too small but not too big. Her skinny figure had become voluptuous. Her hips were as wide as Jasmine’s. Everything was all there.<br />
Vix came out of the employee bathroom. Alexa turned around, tears started to spawn. She rushed over and gave Vix the biggest hug she ever could.<br />
“‘snort’ Thank you.” she said, snorting she wiped tears. It didn’t even ruin her makeup! She cried some more.<br />
“Now there’s the Alexandra I know.” said Vix. <br />
“Please,” said the pig girl, “Call me Alexa.”<br />
“Now Alexa,” Vix said, “That’s all I can do for you. You have the power now. There’s a piece of you inside of there, and when you find it, you’ll turn back into Alexandra, and vice versa.<br />
“I know that they are people out there who want Alexandra. But you have to take responsibility. Can you do that for me?”<br />
Alexa nodded.<br />
“Good,” she walked towards a closet. “Oh right.” she added, “You don’t want to look like a flasher just yet.” She pulled out a black lingerie, a white cropped tank top, and denim short shorts. As Alexa tried them on, she even felt better than ever.<br />
“That’ll be $27.75.” Alexa paid with credit. She got Alexandra’s bags, clothing, and other stuff she brought along.<br />
“Do come again, darling.” Vix said. “I really enjoy our visits.”<br />
Alexa started heading out the door.<br />
“Oh, and Alexa?” She stopped and turned. Vix smiled. “You’re going to do great out there. Make a change.”<br />
<br />
Alexa was so excited. She could finally fit it with Jasmine and the Piglets! She checked her phone. 4:00 PM. Her sister Nancy did promise to pick her up. It sucks Alexandra doesn’t have a car. Oh, the choices. What should she do?</p>
