<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This one was way harder for me to finish than it should have been. Almost a month on my computer lol.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Randall and Felix parked outside the frat.<br />
<br />
Randall was a tall, muscular jock with boyish good looks and long brown hair. Felix was a rather skinny red headed guy who mostly competed in swimming competitions, which was how he got into college in the first place. They’d met on a message board and things had just kind of worked out.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure this is the frat?” Felix asked.<br />
<br />
It was a quarter past 11, so the place should have been packed. And while a few people were staggering drunkenly here and there, the house was strangely quiet. <br />
<br />
“Tch, you’ve been here before. Of course it is,” Randall said as he eyed the empty house. “Maybe they got get raided?”<br />
<br />
They slowly got out and cautiously made their way through the front yard, only to find it covered in weird shit, like the Corvette parked up against the house, the dildos strewn about the lawn, or the pet boa constrictor that was just lying on the walkway.<br />
<br />
“Look at those!” Felix indicated towards a group of raccoons which were rolling around on the lawn. “Did someone get them drunk?”<br />
<br />
“Uh… our parties are wild, but we don’t let it get that wild.” Randall blinked and swore he saw a squirrel trying to drink a beer.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and let Felix in.<br />
<br />
Walking inside, they found it to be in roughly the same state as the outside.  It sounded like two dudes were trying to stealthily fuck in the living room and, as they walked past the bathroom, Randall noticed that the door was open and the counter was covered in tools.<br />
<br />
Felix continued looking around as he followed Randall upstairs to the jock’s room. Sure, he’d been here before, but this would be his first time entering as a prospective frat brother. Which meant that after tonight, he wouldn’t have to sneak in and out anymore.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t help but marvel at just how big and empty the place was, though. <br />
<br />
This frat house was supposed to be party city on a night like this but it kind of felt dead. There were still a few party goers here and there. Jake, the only other guy Felix knew, was passed out in a chair Felix didn’t remember seeing before.<br />
<br />
The backyard seemed to be more active. He could hear people chatting and drinking, the music blaring. That put him more at ease. Still, the utter quiet of the house, punctuated only by the sounds of lewd acts kind of frightened him a bit.  If he didn’t know any better, he’d guess that someone spiked the keg he’d seen earlier with some sort of drug, which was what led to the mess he’d seen so far.<br />
<br />
“You alright man?” Randall said, having finally glanced back and seen the distress on Felix’ face.<br />
<br />
“Nah, it’s fine, I’m all good. Let’s hurry to your room, though.”<br />
<br />
“We won’t have to hide anymore.” Randall assured Felix, taking his hand and squeezing it. “I promise.”<br />
<br />
Randall opened the door to his room. It was plastered with Football posters and paraphernalia, exactly like any other jock. Then, taking a quick look around in the hall, he quickly pulled Felix inside. <br />
<br />
“Once you’re part of our frat, no one will know of our secret love.” Randall said in hushed tones.<br />
<br />
Walking to the back wall, he pulled at it. <br />
<br />
The fake wall creaked open, revealing a shrine to the K-Pop Group Kassanova behind it. Band member’s posters, all signed, were arrayed in a pattern around the shrine. Candles burned in front of the group photo with Felix and Randal waving at the camera.<br />
<br />
“Our secret love of Kassanova.” Randall said proudly smiling at Felix.<br />
<br />
Felix smiled back. “Amazing!”<br />
<br />
“That’s right!” Randall gave him a thumbs up. “All you have to do now is pass the hazing! It needs to be recorded or they won’t accept it!”<br />
<br />
Randall wandered over to his closet and pulled out a camcorder and a tripod. He set it up in the middle of the room. Felix pushed the wall back into place, concealing the shrine.<br />
<br />
“Good thinking, bro. Don’t want to get caught!” Randall laughed.<br />
<br />
“Where the hell is everyone?” Felix finally asked.<br />
<br />
“Fuck if I know. Come here, see that X?” Randall pointed to a spot on the floor.<br />
<br />
Felix wandered over and saw a small blue X made of masking tape on the carpet. He stood there and waited for Randall to finish setting up the shot.<br />
<br />
“Alright. Ready?” Randall hurried over, standing in front of Felix.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. What do I have to do?”<br />
<br />
“If you wanna join the frat, you gotta sniff my farts.” Randall smirked.<br />
<br />
“Ew, no way dude!” Felix recoiled. <br />
<br />
“They got rid of violent hazing, so we have to do this now.” Randall shrugged.<br />
<br />
The lights flickered.<br />
<br />
Both young men frowned at each other and wandered out into the hall. They were just in time to see a cat shake itself out of a pair of shorts. Felix frowned. There was some kind of red light bathing the cat now. It stiffened, yowled, and then shuddered, splattering something on the floor below it. Then the cat began to clean itself.<br />
<br />
The light shut off. Felix followed the direction where the light had come form and saw a strange metal box hanging from the vaulted ceiling. It looked a bit like a video projector and there was some kind of ray-gun like device.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” Felix pointed.<br />
<br />
Randall looked away from the cat and glanced up. “Not sure. Some kind of light display? I’ve never seen anything like it.”<br />
<br />
Felix shivered. “Let’s go back to your room.”<br />
<br />
Randall nodded and they retreated to the relative safety of his bedroom.<br />
<br />
The lights flickered again.<br />
<br />
“That creeped me out.”<br />
<br />
“Huh, you’re just trying to get out of your hazing!” Randall laughed.<br />
<br />
“Can’t we just do the other thing we discussed?” Felix asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that?” Randall grinned and turned off the camcorder. He pulled his clothes off, letting his shorts drop to the floor and stepped out of them. Randall’s long cock bobbed in the air. “Well, go on. Show me what you mean.”<br />
<br />
“That’s….” Felix gulped, “So big.“<br />
<br />
“Long, but thanks.” Randal scratched back of his head.<br />
<br />
Felix got down on his knees in front of the jock and took the cock in his hands. It was warm and smelt faintly of musk. His other hand gently groped Randall’s balls.<br />
<br />
“This is much better.” Felix winked.<br />
<br />
“Aww well, I guess it’s for the best,” Randall leaned forward, “I’ve been wanting to fuck you like a dog all night.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
A drone, no larger than a fly, sat on the bedroom wall, tirelessly waiting for a word to activate it.<br />
<br />
“Dog.”  <br />
<br />
That was all the drone needed to hear.  Focusing its camera on the source of the of the command, its tiny, computerized brain temporarily seized up by an unexpected situation.<br />
<br />
“Error:” it read, “two subjects joined in command area…”<br />
<br />
“Solution: duplicate command.”<br />
<br />
The drone contacted the emitter and gave it coordinates for the first subject, then queued up an identical action to be performed on the second subject once the first had been fully molded into the desired form.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
As Felix took Randall’s long warm cock in his mouth, a red beam of light engulfed Randall.<br />
<br />
Randall went stiff as a board, though Felix didn’t notice. What he did notice was a strange smell that suddenly filled the room. Felix wrinkled his nose and sniffed as he rolled Randall’s warm length in his mouth. It smelled odd, like the air was tinged with… dog musk? But Randall didn’t have a dog… <br />
<br />
The red light had begun to focus and travel down Randall’s form.<br />
<br />
Felix bobbed slowly on Randall’s cock. It tasted like flesh, which meant it didn’t really taste like much of anything, save for a little precum that dribbled sweetly into his mouth. Above him, he heard Randall panting heavily and grinned. At least his head game was right.<br />
<br />
Randall shifted and pranced in place, soft popping sounds coming from above Felix. The young man was too preoccupied with the cock sucking session to care about the strange whining noise his friend was emitting. Actually, it kind of made this hotter. His own erection strained, slapping his hairless belly as he continued to suck and bob.<br />
<br />
Felix felt fists settle on the top of his shoulders as Randall bent over him, giving off needy huffs. He smiled, reaching up and rolling Randall’s balls in his palm, using his other hand around to gently explore the hot jock’s hole. Randall whined and bucked into Felix’ mouth, his breath huffing warmly on the back of the prospective frat brother’s neck.<br />
<br />
The red light descended lower, focusing on the jock’s rear.<br />
<br />
Warmth tingled in Felix’ mouth as he continued to bob. The hand he was using to play with the jock’s ass also tingled pleasantly. Randall’s cock altered in shape, growing more streamlined, thicker in some places while thinner in others. Felix could barely wrap his lengthening tongue around the throbbing member, but to his surprise, managed to do so, as warm, pleasant waves coaxed his jaw creakily forward to engulf the shaft. <br />
<br />
A small flood of runny juices ran over his tongue, the taste sweet and slightly acrid. Randall growled and bucked forward, which startled Felix, but he relaxed his throat, letting that juicy cock slide further inside. A whimper crept up the young frat bro’s throat as he savored the taste of his jock boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Strangely, his fingers started feeling rather stiff, popping out and away from the pucker.<br />
<br />
Felix used his other hand to spread the jock’s cheeks. Gentle, warm tingles crept up his fingers as he gripped the strangely thin hips. He never thought of Randall as particularly hairy, but he’d swear the guy’s ass had fur! Long, silky fur. The fingers on his left had started slipping on the hairy cheek and he found it difficult to grasp anything back there. It felt like his digits were gently being massaged back into his palm. He tried moving them, but they only wiggled, the warmth too soothing to allow anything more. <br />
<br />
Felix couldn’t get a good grip with his hands but managed to adjust his arms, wrapping his wrists around his boyfriend’s hips. His face continued to creak and lengthen, growing longer and longer with each bob. Another spurt of precum jetted into his maw and the young man swallowed it, drool dribbling from his blackening chops. <br />
<br />
He whimpered under his breath, swallowing mouthfuls of the jock’s watery precum as soon as it filled his maw. Tingles and warmth pulsed through his face, washed through his mind, focusing it on that amazing cock. His tongue slid out, long, thin and flexible, caressing that luscious cock, enjoying the feel of fur against his tongue. <br />
<br />
His nostrils flared, the skin darkening and gaining a pebbly texture as he sniffed the air. Randall&#39;s musk smelled smokey, musky, alluring. His nose tingled as it grew wider, more scents swarming Felix mind. The tingles traveled to his ears, which rose to the top of a head that was gently being compressed. They unfurled like wings into big, furry, triangular things.<br />
<br />
The warm, gentle waves continued to throb through his head as the hands on Felix’s shoulders slipped further and further down his back. <br />
<br />
Felix pulled away, marveling at just how strangely furry his lover had become, the fluffy groin all he could see. The musk smell was ever-present now, muddling his thoughts. Above him, he could hear Randall panting and whining like a needy mutt. He sniffed the rocket gingerly, then gave it a long lap. It tasted savory, like organ meat, something his tongue found absolutely delightful. His face prickled as soft fur blossomed across it, jaw popping as it finished shaping into a muzzle. <br />
<br />
There was a loud pop and suddenly all of Randall’s weight fell onto Felix’ back.<br />
<br />
The sudden weight made his own arms drop from around Randall’s furry hips, paws thumping against the floor to steady himself. <br />
<br />
Wait. Paws? <br />
<br />
He blinked, a shudder rolling down his back at the thought. There was something wrong about that, but he was having trouble thinking clearly. Felix turned his head and saw something strange in Randall’s wall mirror. Above him, Randall whined and bucked his hips, his cock missing a spurting precum across Felix’s furry muzzle. <br />
<br />
Felix was too busy staring at the reflection to be bothered. <br />
<br />
In it, a handsome German Shepherd was desperately humping a strange-looking dog-headed creature, its tail wagging and his muzzle open a broad canine grin. But even more peculiar was that the dog creature in the mirror was looking directly at him. Then he realized something – he could feel a soft, heavy weight pressing down against his back, a hard cock flopping around his mouth, and two rough paws gripping against the back of his legs.<br />
<br />
It took a second for the sensations from Felix’s body to align with the scene he saw in the mirror, but eventually they began to overlap.  Then the dog in the mirror thrust against in the creature below it.  Felix felt Randal’s cock forcefully probing against his mouth.  His eyes opening wide in surprise, Felix watched as the creature in the mirror’s eyes did the same.  Then it hit him.  That wasn’t a dog creature about to get face fucked by the German Shepard in the mirror – it was him.  He was the dog creature.  He was about to get face fucked.<br />
<br />
“A dawg?” Felix mouth slurred, voice shifting oddly. He began to panic, realizing something was wrong. “Grroff!” Felix growled, trying to buck the German Shepherd off of him. “Shhtohp! Irrm nert er dawg!”<br />
<br />
Felix finally realized he was turning into a dog. He and Randall had slowly been transforming this whole time! How long had this been happening? Why hadn’t he noticed sooner? He thought back to all the strange things that were happening in the house and suddenly it all clicked. <br />
<br />
That fucking projector was transforming people! The house wasn’t dead, it was fucking with people’s lives! And if he didn’t act fast, he was next. Felix had to do something, had to get away. Felix didn’t want to be a mindless, horny dog.  <br />
<br />
Randall growled, clinging to Felix’ back. He thrust and inched forward on his forming hindpaws, pressing himself into Felix’ slack maw. Felix tried to avert his mouth, but the cock pressed insistently against his muzzle smearing precum across his fur.<br />
<br />
He felt Randall’s forepaws grasp his hips as the dog curled over his body, holding Felix in place and bucking into his muzzle. The jock-dog growled, his warm, dominate scent demanded Felix’ attention and red rocket slamming the back of his throat. That red warmth was focusing on Randall’s head.<br />
<br />
Felix gasped as he felt Randall&#39;s warm tongue lap down, licking his exposed hole. <br />
<br />
He felt new instincts kicking in. His nose was unbelievable perceptive and he could smell everything that was happening. Felix could smell the lingering sex that left its mark all over the house. He could smell the rank musk of the dog licking his ass. Most importantly, he could smell the aching precum leaking from his cock. He was enjoying this, and deep inside, he wanted to let the dog take over.<br />
<br />
Felix whimpered around a mouthful of pre as he felt his ass grow warm and start tingling. His rear end began to gently pop and crack as the light coaxed his hips into a quadrupedal configuration. Randall lapped deeper into a pucker that was puffing slightly and growing more exposed. With a pleasant jolt, he felt a tail being warmly drawn away, tugging his hole along with it. His hips began to wriggle from side to side as the newly grown appendage began to wag. <br />
<br />
The warm light lingered on his pucker. Felix wrinkled his nose as something warm oozed from his hole. A rancid odor, like wet dog and mixed with raw sewage filled the room and made Felix gag. It was cloying and disgusting and Felix tried to paw the reek from his nostrils. <br />
<br />
As he dealt with the stench, his back was starting to hurt as he struggled to continue to support the dog’s weight. <br />
<br />
The light’s warmth tingled at the base of his spine, just above his tail. He groaned and arched his back, stretching and adjusting his weight, desperate to relieve the ache. With a grunt, his spine popped. Relief flooded him as the weight on his back seemed easier to hold up. <br />
<br />
He squirmed as the tingles penetrated his balls, making them swell and churn as they expanded nicely, fur tickling his thighs. His erection ached as the warmth enveloped them, feeling even stiffer and more swollen. Tingles began moving up his shaft, stretching and warping the flesh. Felix bucked his hips into empty air, desperately needing relief.<br />
<br />
When he turned his head to the mirror again, all he could see were two dogs. A red light was concentrated on the back of Randall’s head as the canine ate Felix out with his long tongue. The back of Randall’s skull was softly pulsing and shrinking, the bones shifting and popping into place. <br />
<br />
Felix thought he should be scared, but yelped as a jolt of pleasure shot from his hole. Randall’s tongue slipped inside his tensing ring, brushing against his prostate with every lick. All he could do was whine and whimper like a needy mutt as Randall ate his ass out. Something began to swell inside his mouth, something hard and veiny, forcing his jaws apart. <br />
<br />
It took a moment for Felix to realize it was Randall’s knot.<br />
<br />
Thinking was getting harder. His body had used so much energy in the process of transforming that his struggle left him feeling empty. It felt like he was falling asleep as his thoughts grew more and more scattered… slow… and hollow. But he could feel something in the emptiness. A new being that wasn’t quite himself. Felix wondered for a brief moment as he felt the primal sensation that he was forgetting something very important. He focused on the knot in his mouth and licked it. <br />
<br />
His body jolted with life as he barely managed to remember his humanity.<br />
<br />
No! He wouldn’t submit! He was human! No matter how much he wanted to stay, he had to run!<br />
<br />
He struggled to pull his mouth off the knot. Randall whined and shifted, repositioning himself to tighten his grip. With a hard squirm and buck, Felix managed to pop the dick out of his mouth and throw the dog off of him.<br />
<br />
Felix scrambled to get away from the smelly dog, his legs ungainly and awkward. <br />
<br />
A red beam of light sparkled in front of him, shining warmly against his head. Pleasant, comforting tingles enveloped his head. Felix’s tongue lolled out of the side of his mouth, saliva dripping to the floor. The panic he had felt moments ago was quickly soothed away. His nostrils flared as he calmed down, huffing the air.<br />
<br />
There was no fight to be had. Felix felt his instincts take over as his memories shifted. He remembered growing up in a small litter, being adopted by a young college student, and living in a fraternity house. There were always new smells to be had from a constantly shifting home, which he indulged with great pleasure. Each new smell piqued his curiosity and opened new, latent desires. He loved sniffing things, which was why he was named… named..<br />
<br />
Felix closed his eyes and Stinky opened his.<br />
<br />
He sniffed. There was that gross doggy reek again. It was strong and Stinky wrinkled his muzzle in disgust. This time, however, the red light pulsed a burst of pleasurable tingles into Stinky’s mind and the smell conjured with it a powerful mental image of a healthy, virile male dog. His cock went rigid and his tail raised involuntarily.<br />
<br />
Stinky paused, huffing the air. <br />
<br />
Behind him, he heard paws tread the carpet behind him. Stinky turned, his movements slow and his legs stiff as he greeted the other dog. It was touch and go at first, the two canines circling each other. He sniffed and caught a whiff of that vile fragrance coming from the dog’s backside. Stinky licked his chops and tried to get a better whiff. The smell was vile, but he could help himself, there was something about that stench that seemed oddly familiar.<br />
<br />
He was trying to figure out why such an offensive odor was making him so horny when a wet, cold nose pressed beneath his raised tail. Stinky flinched but turned his head to watch as Randall sniffed his asshole with intense curiosity. While Randall was preoccupied, Stinky pressed his own snout to the other dog’s rear, giving the oily pucker a cautious sniff.<br />
<br />
It was gross, as expected, but the red light gently massaged his skull some more, the bone pulsing softly. <br />
<br />
Stinky whined as the stench shifted. The rank dog smell, which had been disgusting, slowly began to smell better and better. Like farting when his nose was tucked under his tail while he slept at night. As the other dog started to smell more like himself, Stinky couldn’t help but appreciate the familiar scent. The image of the virile dog grew more clear as he sniffed, and Stinky came to the realization that HE was the handsome dog.<br />
<br />
His arousal grew, red cock aching. <br />
<br />
He extended his tongue and lapped at his hole, expecting to feel it, but strangely, he felt nothing. Stinky cocked his head, his doggy mind growing increasingly confused. His nose said that there was only one dog in the room, while his eyes saw two.<br />
<br />
Other Stinky nuzzled underneath Stinky’s hips, a warm tongue lapping at his groin. <br />
<br />
Stinky could smell Other Stinky’s arousal as well, as it was his own. The dog turned, spine flexible, and shoved his own muzzle underneath Other Stinky’s groin, muzzle engulfing his red rocket. Both dogs bobbed and sucked, whines and whimpers of pleasure filling the air.<br />
<br />
He was growing more and more comfortable with Other Stinky, now. His muzzle suckling Other Stinky’s cock while Other Stinky was sucking his dick made sense to his increasingly doggy mind. After all, he was sucking his own cock. Or was it Other Stinky’s cock? The line between them was growing blurry, their brain waves slowly syncing with each other with every warm, gentle tingle. <br />
<br />
Somehow, he could sense that Other was getting close to orgasm, his yips and howls growing more frantic.<br />
<br />
Then the warmth washed through his brain and Stinky shuddered as his own yips and howls joined the Other’s chorus. Both dogs started bucking their hips in the other’s muzzle at the same time. Their knots inflated, jets of precum spattering across both of their tongues.<br />
<br />
Both Stinkys howled in tandem as they came, spurts of cum jetting down their eager throats.</p>
