<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joshua led his Friends to his brother&#39;s room. He was attempting to see if his brother was walking around so he was very careful and looked at every corner.<br />
You&#39;re taking too long! Nick complained. My dick is getting cold!<br />
I don&#39;t want my brother see us like this! Joshua said. He will be bothering us if he sees us.<br />
I have a better idea than sneaking around... Kenny said. Randy, are you here?!!<br />
Kenny&#39;s voice resounded through all house, but he didn&#39;t hear and answer.<br />
Are you crazy? Raul said. Why did you do that?<br />
It&#39;s way easier too ask him instead of sneaking from him... Kenny said.<br />
Do you think so? Joshua said. Well, listen to yourself... You sound like a grow man, you idiot!!<br />
Hey? Who is there?! A voice coming from downstairs said. Is that you, Vince? I&#39;m pissing, wait until I finish!<br />
The kids sigh of relief. Randy had confused Kenny with his friend, Vince, so they had some time to go to his room and look for some clothes to wear. They ran until they reached Randy&#39;s room. It was bigger than Joshua&#39;s room and it has a balcony overlooking the pool.<br />
Your brother&#39;s room is amazing! Raul said. But the smell... ugh... it stinks like a dead rat!<br />
Come on! Joshua said. We must hurry. Randy won&#39;t be at bathroom for so long! Nick, help to look in his closet!<br />
Joshua and Nick were looking through Randy&#39;s clothes until they found a locker like the ones in school. When Nick opened it they found a lot of underwear, boxers, whitey tighties, jockstraps and speedos. Some of them were clean but some other were dirty.<br />
Ugh! Nick said. Your brother had mixed his clean underwear with the dirty...<br />
I see it. Joshua said. But there is no time to be selective. Raul and Kenny, try to wear some clothes until one fits you.<br />
Raul wasn&#39;t sure about it but Kenny quickly started to try on some underwear. He put a lot of them and when he felt it was tight he threw them off. He was doing that until he tried on a white speedo which fits him.<br />
Finally I have found something comfortable! Kenny said successfully. Nick I have taken another one for you!<br />
Kenny... Raul said as he took off a seemingly small boxer. Those speedos are very dirty... Look, they have pee stains...<br />
Kenny looked at the speedo he was wearing and he realized Raul was right. But maybe those stains were not with piss. He was going to remove the speedo when he heard someone coming up the stairs.<br />
Randy! Joshua shouted. He&#39;s coming! Hurry, we need to go!<br />
But I found nothing that fits me. Raul complained. And Kenny&#39;s speedos are too nasty!<br />
We have no time. Joshua replied. Come on! I know a way to get to my parents&#39; room through the balcony!<br />
Joshua ran to the balcony followed by Nick, Kenny and Raul at the end. Joshua moved to the left where some vines were on the wall. Then he clung to them and fell to the courtyard. Kenny did the same and then they ran inside the house.<br />
I can&#39;t do that! Raul said. My willy will hurt with the vines!<br />
There is no choice! Nick said and then he got the speedo that Kenny gave him. Pink and dirty... good choice, Kenny...<br />
Nick went down and met with the others. Raul was afraid to go down the vines but when he heard Randy was opening the door, he had to do it. While he came down the vines his dick moved everywhere like if it was alive. Friction with the vines aroused him and when he reach the floor he had a massive erection. His Friends were so surprised that their mouths fell down. Raul was red of embarrasment and he tried to cover his member, but he wasn&#39;t able to hide anything.<br />
Don&#39;t see me! He yelled, but the other boys ignored him until they heard Randy shouting in his room.<br />
This is my parents&#39; room. Joshua said. Come on, Raul! Let&#39;s find some clothes to wear.<br />
Hey, Raul! Kenny said. How did you do that? I have been trying to harden my cock since it got this size but I was unable to do it. I was thinking these dicks were useless until I saw you!<br />
Raul didn&#39;t say anything, he was so embarrassed that he turned his back to his friends.<br />
Why did you give me a pink and nasty speedo to wear? Nick complained to Kenny. I look ridiculous!<br />
Your bulge is ridiculous enough... Kenny answered. And they were the only clothes that fit us, it&#39;s not my fault that Joshua&#39;s brother have a little dick...<br />
Hey! Don&#39;t say that about my brother! Joshua replied, but he gave a small smile when he thought he was bigger than his brother. Anyway, Raul I think I found some clothes for us. Sorry, Nick, there are only two, so you will keep that speedo for a while.<br />
Joshua threw the underwear to Raul whose dick had already softened.<br />
A yellow speedo? Raul said. Why do your family have too much of these?<br />
Well... Joshua answered as he put a black speedo. We have a pool, what did you expect?</p>
