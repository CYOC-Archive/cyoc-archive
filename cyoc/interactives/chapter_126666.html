<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Good Ending<br/>
If I get particularly inspired I might do the alternate ending but otherwise I won't continue from here, feedback welcome</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You Master Tony. Please be my master&quot; Micro begged as he dropped to his hands and knees &quot;let me serve and worship you! Punish me however you want for the transgressions of my past life! But please allow me to remain by your side as your faithful slave!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So be it&quot; Tony smiled as he looked at the Chronivac<br />
<br />
The &quot;Mass Alteration&quot; menu was still up with the ten masters check marked<br />
<br />
Erase Memory-<br />
About: Everything<br />
From: 1 hour(s) ago<br />
To: Now<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to bed now&quot; said Tony &quot;Make sure this place is cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Micro immediately dipped his head down and began lapping up the large puddle of piss<br />
 <br />
&quot;That&#39;ll take forever.&quot; Tony snorted <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Master I&#39;ll get a mop&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And ruin a perfectly good mop with traces of your inferior fluids?&quot; snapped Tony &quot;Go to my room, take Mike&#39;s old clothes and use them to wipe this place up. He won&#39;t be needing them anymore.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master, how stupid of me, I&#39;ll do that master&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And take a shower first, I don&#39;t want you dripping piss in my room&quot;<br />
<br />
Micro spent the night mopping up the room with Mike&#39;s old clothes. With every piece of clothing Micro drenched in piss, it felt like another piece of Mike was being washed away. His football jersey was trashed, his letterman jacket, all his jockstraps and underwear with worn out groins that nestled Mike&#39;s cock, the jeans he wore to display his bulge, the shirts he wore to show off his muscles. By the end of the night he threw away all his piss soaked clothes except for the torn shirt and briefs Mike was wearing when he went to the dorm party as well as the jacket and jeans which he washed.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The next few days led to some major changes for Micro and Tony. They pushed the two beds in Tony&#39;s room together. Master Tony was generous enough to let Micro sleep in the corner on the floor where Mike&#39;s bed use to be. They attended classes and snickers followed Micro all around campus whereas Tony was always greeted with nods of respect. Tony was very popular and had a very active social life. Micro who&#39;s life revolved around Master Tony was ordered to focus on his studies whenever Tony wasn&#39;t around. He wasn&#39;t even allowed to diddle his tiny dick without expressed permission which led to long nights reviewing his text books while an aching stiffy dripped in his undies (Master was generous enough to let him sew together and wash the underwear he wore at the dorm party).<br />
<br />
Micro seemed to grow more and more depraved beyond the alterations of the Chronivac. Whenever Tony brought someone back to the room to fuck, Micro would wait outside until they left, then run inside and fish the condoms out of the trash to lick. When Master Tony decided to throw out some old socks, Micro begged to keep them so he could sniff Master Tony while he slept. Tony started to wonder if this was entirely due to the Chronivac&#39;s influence.<br />
<br />
One day Master Tony pissed in Micro&#39;s mouth so he wouldn&#39;t have to walk to the bathroom. Micro accidentally spilled some and Master Tony was very disappointed. He reset ALL the attributes on Micro to default on the Chronivac and told Micro he wasn&#39;t sure he deserved to be his slave anymore. Micro became absolutely miserable. All week he remained completely submissive, even when he got no sexual arousal from it swearing up and down he would always serve Master Tony and try to please him. It was clear his submissive state of mind was not a result of the Chronivac influence but something deep that had changed within himself. He begged Master Tony to change him back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will always serve you Master,&quot; He pleaded &quot;Even if it means my big ugly sausage doesn&#39;t get stiffies anymore. Even if it makes me miserable. But please let me have my pathetic little dicky back! I&#39;m not worthy to walk around with a real man&#39;s penis! Please make my dicky go squirty from being humiliated and tortured again Master!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Master Tony was generous enough to change Micro back and give him a second chance.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
When they graduated both landed themselves good jobs, but Micro only did it so he could better serve Master Tony. They lived in different places but every week Micro&#39;s paycheck went directly to his Master who would give Micro just enough to get by. Sometimes Master was generous enough to buy Micro a new dildo (to remind him how insignificant his weewee was) or a cock cage (Micro didn&#39;t touch himself without permission but the cock cage made sure anyone who saw him pee knew it, which made him gooey). Micro&#39;s hard work eventually helped pay for Master&#39;s new house. Micro&#39;s little boner bounced up and down when he found out Master would permit him to stay in his shed. He hadn&#39;t been close to Master in so long, he hadn&#39;t felt the lash of his belt, or the length of his cock or the taste of his piss. He moved in as soon as he could. It had been so long since he had been able to serve Master Tony, that he squirted right into his undies when he found out he would get to go into the main house to clean and cook for his Master. Sometimes Master Tony would even ask him to stay and he would use Micro for pleasure activities. Even on nights when he used someone else, Master was kind enough to leave his used condoms in the trash as a tasty treat for Micro when he cleaned the house the next day!<br />
<br />
Every night when he went back to his shed, Micro would stare out his window at the house hoping Master would need him for something, only going to sleep when the lights at the main house went out. When Master Tony found out what a good slave Micro had become he permitted Micro to take off his cage and give his stiffy three rubs, once a week before he went to bed. More than the rubs, knowing he had served Master Tony well was what made Micro squick a wad of juice every seven days.<br />
<br />
One day Master Tony informed Micro that he had a surprise for their 15th year anniversary since the dorm party. The anniversary also coincided with Micro&#39;s weekly rub night. Master Tony didn&#39;t use him for anything besides cooking and cleaning leading up to the day. Every night he sat in his shed watching the house, wondering what his surprise was. A new paddle? A bigger butt plug? More chores? (His dinky leaked extra prejuice imagining that last one).<br />
<br />
On the big day Micro was dripping with anticipation (More than usual) and ready to explode with gratitude for Master Tony no matter what his surprise was. However after he cooked Master&#39;s dinner and cleaned Master&#39;s house, he was told to go back to his shed. Micro was confused but he obeyed. He sat up in his shed as usual watching the house, wondering when Master Tony would call for him. But hours passed and to Micro&#39;s disappointment, Master Tony&#39;s bedroom light went out without Micro being summoned.<br />
<br />
Micro dejectedly undid his cage for his three rubs. He gave his little 2.5 inch stiffy one tug, and started to worry. What if had done something to disappoint Master Tony. After the second tug he realized his dicky wouldn&#39;t go squirties if he thought Master was displeased. Just as he was about to stop he felt his tiny boner started shrinking between his fingers. He looked down and his micropenis was still rigid but had shrunk down from 2.5 inches to one inch! The sensation made him realize Master must have used his Chronivac to shrink Micro&#39;s little dick even more!<br />
<br />
Knowing that he hadn&#39;t disappointed his master, knowing that he was now more inferior than he&#39;d ever been in his life, Micro gave his new extra small microdick one third and final tug. His pimple burst with dicklet juice all around the shed, it hit the ceiling, sprayed the walls, spattered his sheets and got in his eyes. But it didn&#39;t stop there Micro kept spurting and squirting wave after wave of pleasure shuddering through his body all centered around his button boner. <br />
<br />
Tony smiled and put the Chronivac away. As he laid in bed, even through his closed window, he could hear the voice of his ex-bully calling out from his shed between squeals of elation; &quot;THANK YOU MASTER TONY&quot;</p>
