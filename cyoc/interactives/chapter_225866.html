<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa let out a massive sigh and pondered that even if she was younger she kept all her memories from her 16-year-old body. After couple of weeks thinking and adjusting her life to this new reality. She decided to have a new goal in her life. By using the stopwatch she would enroll herself to the Harvard University while her brother and sister would only be okay with Ivy league schools.<br />
<br />
Years started to roll by as the odd 8-year-old would focus on school rather than play with her classmates. She would have hard time to explain to her teachers and parents that she wants to aim at Harward. They would laugh and belittle her for having such childish dreams, but with help of the stopwatch. She was able to ace every test until she approached the age of 14.<br />
<br />
Her brother was at this point grown older and was 24-years-old graduate who had shut down in their mothers basement while her sister at age of 20 was studying her craft as painter. Meanwhile Lisa&#39;s parents were no in their mid 40s taking care of her as she tried her best to study. Mentally Lisa was acting like a typical 22-year-old girl and accidentally let out curse words slip from her mouth. As the high school was nearing and as she go closer to her normal age Lisa felt weird how petty and shallow her classmates would be towards her.<br />
<br />
The high school was troublesome time for Lisa as the test weren&#39;t as hard as they could have been, but at the same time. Most of them were big head-scratchers. Now 17-year-old, year older than what she had been, she had cumulated 9 years worth of extra knowledge and understanding of the world BUT STILL she couldn&#39;t get higher than Bs in her test. She felt dissapointed and contemplated if she would use the stopwatch once more just to regress herself by one or two years.<br />
<br />
The pressure was creeping on her but she did it anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here goes nothing&quot;, Lisa said and regressed back by three years making her 14-year-old again.<br />
<br />
Years went by and even with two more extra years she only got B plusses.<br />
<br />
As her second 17th birthday was rolling. She had to repeat the regression once more, just two more years and maybe just maybe she could hit A minuses and barely hit the bare requirements for getting in the Harvard. So she did and down she shrank down back 14-year-old thrice more.<br />
<br />
As four years had gone by she noticed her body being more mature than what she was previously. Lisa finally picked up the acceptance papers for Harvard and wanted to make herself look pretty before her parents would come back home from work. She glanced at the bathroom mirror and noticed that without make-up she was looking as if she in her mid twenties rathe than early twenties. Her mother had commented in past how it was odd how she used c-cup bras rather than a-cups and that Lisa&#39;s speech was more more align to her sister who was... how old is she again... twenty... 31-year-old....<br />
<br />
Lisa started to realize that her brother and sister were no as old as her parents were when she was 10-year-old originally.<br />
<br />
&#39;This can&#39;t be right. How old am I again? twenty? no. thirty?&#39; Lisa thought &#39;I&#39;ve been too focused on the studies that I&#39;ve forgotten how many years has gone by. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve been stuck in same four year cycle for a decade. So this would mean...&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, I should be in my thirties!&quot; Lisa shouted.<br />
<br />
Physically and socially Lisa was considered 18-years-old girl who was applying her papers to the Harvard, but mentally she was thinking like a 30-year-old woman. She was panicking a little as her whole family had grown much older than what she was. She begun to think how her mother and father were closing in their 50s and her sister and brother were 30-years-old.<br />
<br />
She run to her room and inspected her whole body and finally understood her situation. Even if her body was 18 years old her brain was pumping the body with more mature brain chemistry making the body slightly more older. She had smooth skin, but her massive D or E sized tits and a little bit bit of ass dominated her frame. Bouncers would see her as over 21 for sure as no-one at her age had this kind of hourglass figure. As if she had borrowed chest and ass from an older lady. Breasts looked comical as they weren&#39;t sagging that much and still pushed themselves forward. Thighs were thick as tree trunks and her ass had gotten a upgrade.<br />
<br />
&#39;I look like thinner version of that venus statue people keep posting in social media.&#39; Lisa thought to herself as she dressed down in front the room&#39;s full body mirror. &#39;Even my couchie is hairier than usual. Same with armpits. They are like a jungle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa was getting more and more hornier as she kept watching and watching her body.<br />
<br />
&#39;What... why do I look so... sexy..&#39; Lisa pondered and sat on near her bed. &#39;I should buy a dil- no. I should get a man in Harvard.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Why is this getting me so excited all of a sudden. That&#39;s me in the mirror. I-&#39; Lisa thought and slowly started to rub her exposed vagina. &#39;Fuck. I can&#39;t. Even if I&#39;m alone here I should-&#39;<br />
<br />
Lisa couldn&#39;t hold it. This was her first time masturbating. She had been so invested in her studies that everything else had flew by her. No friends meant no talking about boys and not talking about boys meant she rarely got into the mood. She occasionally had crushes and would express it more mildly or not at all, but today was different.<br />
<br />
&#39;I want someone to have sex with me. I grave pleasure. I want this.&#39; Lisa consoled herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fucking slut. All you wanted was to get to a school.&quot; She said to the mirro as if thinking her duplicate would say that you her. &quot;You whore. You always wanted THIS. You are sick pervert who would have sex with anyone at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes and fell down on top of the bed while still keeping her arm on top of the vagina lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sinful and greedy pig. You rejected lust just to get inside a school. You dirty little cheater.&quot; She mutter to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take THIS!&quot; She shouted and pushed her finger on her nub with force.<br />
<br />
This was her first orgasm which sent her into a shock. A sudden jolt of pleasure filled her brain. She continued and begun to circle her finger on top of the cherry. This sent even more pleasure in her brain.<br />
<br />
&#39;I haven&#39;t felt this good in... in... NEVER! Why didn&#39;t anyone tell me that this is better than sugar. Better than thrill rides. Better than scary movies.&#39; Lisa winced as she thought her mirror self belittling her through the mirror.<br />
<br />
10 minutes had passed and Lisa was finished. Gasping for air as she finally understood what she had been missing out. This was her reward for the hard work. She was going to continue this at Harvard as long as she could. Finally what little energy she had left. She fell asleep as she closed her eyes.</p>
