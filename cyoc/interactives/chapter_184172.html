<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter speak briefly of beings called Wulvers. Initially a Wulver is a peaceful creature from sottish myths, look like a werewolf. But unlike werewolf, they don&#39;t have a human form and were even born as a wulver. (They also are immortals.)<br/>
<br/>
I needed Scottish beings able to wear kilts and when I found the wulvers I said &quot;Let&#39;s make them cousins to my râkshasas!&quot;</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There is, of course, orders even a magically enslaved person can&#39;t obey. The first being, alas, the one to call their master (or mistress) by name. (Unless it could endanger the life of said master or mistress, like if they are an undercover policeman or spy, for example.)<br />
<br />
Such a slave is also unable obey any order that would endanger their master well-being. The most obvious is that they can&#39;t kill their master even if ordered by said master, but Aditi can&#39;t do Colin&#39;s homework for him either. They can do their homework together, and if Colin didn&#39;t understand the lesson she can try explaining to him another way. (Not that she would need to do so often, ISM is an elite school with elite teachers. Not in the sense of snobby and pretentious, but in the sense they all explain things very well and never hesitate to adapt and redo said explanations for the students that need it.)<br />
<br />
But Aditi is still a slave and, as such, feel the need to serve her master (and by extension his family). That&#39;s why, in this new reality she insisted in bringing in and unpacking their luggage alone, not letting the others help her. She&#39;s also learned to cook, wash and iron the laundry, do house cleaning and, if Colin let her, she would be the one washing and dressing him instead of letting the boy do it himself.<br />
<br />
As said before, the International School of Magic is an elite school, free for anyone with good magical aptitude and the will to work hard, co-financed by every nations. It&#39;s also a boarding school situated on neutral ground. (It&#39;s a almost like the school was its own country.) Ordinarily students are placed in dorms, with one for girls and another for boys, but because of their special circumstances, Aditi and Colin were instead given one of the house the school habitually use to accommodate the teachers.<br />
<br />
While she had initially started disguising as male at school, not knowing of the special dispositions the ISM had taken, it was now one of the few place she was comfortable not doing so, even if half the girls still think she&#39;s really a boy who started to dress as a girl in the (vain) hope to be left alone. But even with that, she was still impatiently waiting for school to start again.<br />
<br />
For the curious about the ISM&#39;s uniform, here come a description:<br />
The top, identical for both genders, consist of a beige jacket atop a black shirt and a tie. The tie&#39;s color changing according to the student&#39;s grade. (The jacket become facultative during the summer.) When it come to the bottom part, the boys have a pants the same beige as the jacket, black dress shoes and socks the same color as the tie. The girls can choose a skirt that goes below the knee instead of pants if they so wish, lot of them does. (Even Aditi do, sometimes.)<br />
Well, there is no rule preventing a boy from wearing the skirt, it just never happened.<br />
… Unless you count the Wulvers, who are authorized to wear a kilt with the pattern associated to their clan.<br />
<br />
Wulvers are best described as the wolf counterpart to Râkshasas. One would think the two would naturally hate each others, but they would be wrong. The two species are long-time allies, in part because of their historically very similar lifestyles. Both to live in clans which, in structure, look more like a wolf-pack than a lion&#39;s pride. The only major difference is that the Wulvers were sedentary for at least as long as they wrote, to the point they used to be a little known species, the few aware of their existence (beside Râkshasas) not even knowing they could transform.<br />
<br />
Râkshasas for their part were far more nomadic which, combined with their prideful nature, made their ability to change form a well known fact that had marked them as monsters for generations. While their are thankful it helped mask their ability to magically coat their claws in poison, it also prevented people from realizing the strong healing capability of their saliva, which is as much a curse than a blessing, since some peoples might have hunted them for said saliva otherwise. The main reason of their survival was their bargaining ability which, combined with their nomadic life style, make lot of nations see them as a &quot;hated but necessary evil&quot;.<br />
<br />
While nomadic Râkshasa clans still exist, most of them are now sedentary, in one of the few monarchy left in the world, and the youngest one. Rather than calling this country&#39;s ruler a king or queen, they call it a maharaja, regardless of said ruler gender and, while that title is usually hereditary, if its older ever betray their peoples, they would instantly loose their place, replaced by someone more trustworthy. Trust and honesty are very important to them.<br />
<br />
Jane closed the Journal of Facts, instantly forgetting she just wrote in it. As far as she was concerned, it was an ordinary notebook, if a bit fancy, and had just wanted to read what her brother had done with it, only to disappointingly see it was still new. &quot;Didn&#39;t I see you write anything in it on our way back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I almost did, but I changed my mind&quot; lied Colin.<br />
<br />
While giving back the Journal of Fact, Jane remembered hearing that a member of Râkshasan royalty was also attending ISM, a princess Rabhya taaj Râkshasa if her memory was right. She had asked Aditi and Colin what she was like, but apparently they never met her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Journal itself was very happy. Where it had been unable to twist Colin&#39;s desires, it had been so easy to do it with his sister&#39;s, regardless of how well intentioned she had been, giving the boy something he needed to be happy, but in a way that made him and his newly created girlfriend suffer. And the fact Jane had illustrated everything was a nice bonus, since it was both counting and not-counting as having everything written twice. So Colin would be able to see his sister changed reality, but would not be able to reverse her change, nor remember what reality was like before. (And he won&#39;t be able to scold his sister since no one else can see the proof, and she don&#39;t remember writing, let alone what she wrote.) If it could, the Journal would cackle.</p>
