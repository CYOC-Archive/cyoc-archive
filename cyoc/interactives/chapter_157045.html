<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Right as John was getting out of a stairwell to her next class she heard a voice that was familiar in a bad way yell &quot;JOHN!&quot; Turning around John saw the bully of the school Vicki running up the stairs towards her. It was less she was a straight up Bully as she rarely picked fights with anyone, but more she was a Delinquent with an anger issue. That and for some reason her uniforms always seemed to be getting tears... getting closer she yelled &quot;The Hell did you do to Ms. Stone?!?&quot; Ms. Stone was a tall and stubborn woman. Everyone stopped acting up whenever she was around and Vicki had a respect for her. It seemed Vicki probably only heard parts of the Chronos thing and thought John was abusing her power or something. Ms. Stone was following after Vicki, but Ms. Stone was one of the faculty John had regressed and after Vicki stopped yelling John could hear the little girl panting as she finally got to the third floor. <br />
Joining the conversation Ms. Stone muttered &quot;when did stairs get so big?... Vicki stop this Jane-&quot; <br />
Vicki only really seeing a panting little girl that John had abused said &quot;Don&#39;t worry Stone, magic or not I can still force her.&quot; Vicki turning to John with rage in her eyes yelled &quot;Turn her back before I pummel you to oblivion!&quot; with a really strong punch starting to get telegraphed. <br />
John was having none of that and as Vicki started shrinking John said &quot;I consider this self defense&quot; as the big bully shrank a little as battle scars, height, and curves started to dwindle. The once high schooler now an early middle schooler, and interestingly enough she was wearing a dress that wasn&#39;t completely torn up.  <br />
Vicki was in a little bit of TF shock and Stone muttered &quot;Hopefully she&#39;ll calm down...&quot; <br />
That said Vicki was getting over it and yelled &quot;I may be smaller, but I can still kick your ASS BITCH!&quot; Then the Delinquent started to shrink to the stature of a cute mid elementary school student. Vicki&#39;s mind was getting kind of muddled with the constant time tinkering and was letting out insults a single word at a time. <br />
Stone said &quot;...Alright she seems to be calm now- What are you doing now?!?&quot; as Vicki seemed to shrink further down.<br />
John simply said &quot;Sorry, my &quot;finger&quot; was on the regression &quot;trigger&quot; and I accidentally pulled.&quot; For sure the multiple regressions seemed to have made the once Delinquent a confused pre-schooler in a simple shirt and dress, and most of her physical threats now pointless. <br />
Vicki muttered &quot;...why&#39;s everything so big...&quot; and looked up to John&#39;s grinning face and got scared and ran down the stairs crying. Stone called to Vicki to come back, but Yumi still trying to Corral little kids noticed another one running and gasped and panted to try to get her to the school&#39;s office which only scared Vicki to run faster. Yumi for sure looked tired and didn&#39;t seem to have noticed that the bell had rung... maybe she was on some sort of runners high? <br />
Stone grinned and said &quot;Right... we were playing tag with Yumi... Do you think we went overboard?&quot;<br />
John replied &quot;Coulda just told her what was happening.&quot;<br />
&quot;But she wouldn&#39;t have chased us then would she?&quot;<br />
&quot;...you know you all are acting kind of weird as kids.&quot; <br />
&quot;Really? Never noticed.&quot; Then the second class bell rung and the mini-teacher and student were late, and the two had to run into their classroom. <br />
<br />
In the classroom John got to her desk and Stone said &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late everyone. The stairs were pretty big!&quot; <br />
Some of the popular girls were chatting a &quot;Whose the brat?&quot; was audible. <br />
Saya&#39;s little lackey Nelly noted &quot;Maybe it has something to do with that time thing? Didn&#39;t you try some prayer that worked Saya?&quot;<br />
Then Sayaka said &quot;She got smaller, but then grew up... Who knows if it worked?&quot; <br />
Stone yelled in as authoritative voice as a little girl could &quot;Class I&#39;m Ms. Stone Your Physics Teacher!.. Now that I have your attention, yes one of our students has had a bit of a weird day becoming a priestess for some time god. As you can see I am now younger than you, but that doesn&#39;t mean I know less. So let&#39;s turn to page 237 as we discuss more on the differences between speed and velocity in terms of liquid pressure!&quot; The class went relatively normally although the class was a little more observant with the teacher now being a child. The class bell rang and as everyone went on their way out John approached Ms. Stone. <br />
John asked &quot;So... feel alright staying as a kid till the end of the schoolday? I could change you back now if you want.&quot;<br />
Stone grinned and said &quot;Oh no this is the best. The students are paying attention more, we should do this more often... sure the spectacle is what&#39;s drawing attention but they seem to be paying attention to the physics that make toilets possible. I&#39;ve got to get the other teachers to amke tallies get data, an-&quot;  <br />
John cut her off saying &quot;I get it, your happy... You seem a lot more giddy recently. Like back when you were thinking about your torture of Yumi, when you were assigning homework, or even now with your unbridled excitement over the experiment. Your behavior seems to change with your age a little. It may be important to understand that if we&#39;re going to do this regularly.&quot; <br />
Stone growing bored of John&#39;s concern simply said &quot;Bah you sound like one of those psychology majors, Boring! My mind&#39;s sound enough that I remember my physics education and my adult memories. Besides you should get to your next class before you&#39;re late.&quot;<br />
John started backing out and said &quot;Guess you&#39;re right...&quot; and left as Rachel was looking through her desk for a scientific notebook.</p>
