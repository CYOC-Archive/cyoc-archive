<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thanks to yesterday’s debacle, Paul decided against using the medallion on himself to try and improve his body. It seemed Melissa liked him as he was. How else could his mother had got so far with her so quickly? He waited patiently for a text from Melissa. Then he waited impatiently for a text from Melissa. It wasn’t until 10.45 that his phone pinged. The message was ’11.30 CU’. There was no name to the text. He replied “CU there”. Paul had to assume it was Melissa. He was already dressed so set off straight away. It would not matter if he arrived there 10 minutes early.<br />
<br />
He didn’t find Melissa at first. But he ran into Dave who was with Tracy. That was not a total surprise. Mandy had told him that the two of them had hit it off at the party and Dave had bragged about kissing the girl, but seeing them holding hands was a bit of a shock. Dave saw him and gave a wave. Paul approached. He acknowledged Tracy. He had always had difficulty talking to girls. What should he say to her?<br />
<br />
‘What are you to doing here?’<br />
<br />
It was Tracy who spoke up ‘Melissa said to meet here. We were waiting for her’ That made sense. Tracy and Melissa seemed to be best friends at school.<br />
<br />
‘I’m here to meet her as well. What’s going on?’<br />
<br />
‘Just a chance to hang out together I guess’ replied Dave<br />
<br />
Melissa turned up shortly afterwards. She was in a green t-shirt and blue jeans. Paul was amazed how he had not previously noted how beautiful she was. It was hard to imagine that this girl had barely gained his attention previously. It was also hard to imagine that this girl had let him feel her breasts.<br />
<br />
‘Hi Guys’ she said as she approached them.<br />
<br />
Tracy gave Melissa a hug. Dave gave her a smile and a ‘Hello’. Paul didn’t know what to say. He froze. Should he give her a hug as Tracy had? He said ‘Hi’ but his voice sounded so meek. He immediately looked at his feet and didn’t see the puzzled look Melissa gave him.<br />
<br />
Next thing Paul knew was that the redhead had grasped his hand and was leading him towards the shops. ‘Are you alright Paul?’ she asked as the followed Dave and Tracy, who were also holding hands.<br />
<br />
‘Yeah, I think so’ Paul knew that wasn’t a very good answer ‘Where are we going?’ again Paul’s voice was embarrassingly high.<br />
<br />
‘Tracy has told me about a shop that has the most amazing accessories. We are going to go and have a look’<br />
<br />
Paul tagged along. He didn’t know what to do. They went into a shop. There was an overpowering smell of incense or something similar. Paul wasn’t sure what sort of shop it was, there were women’s clothes and shoes but there were also statues, handbags and things that dangled from the ceiling. Tracey gave a screech and said ‘Look at this. Isn’t it pretty?<br />
<br />
Melissa pulled Paul across to see what Tracy had found. It was a small metal doll with wings like a dragonfly. It didn’t appeal to Paul at all. <br />
<br />
Melissa seemed to like it though ‘Neat! but look at those shoes’. She pointed at something further down the aisle. Paul looked at Dave. Dave looked equally bewildered. <br />
<br />
They spent 10 minutes in that shop. Every minute one of the girls found something wonderful. ‘Come and look at this!’ <br />
<br />
Tracy pulled some sort of skirt off a rack and held it to her body. She asked Dave ‘Do you like this?’ Dave had a dumb look on his face and nodded.<br />
<br />
That wasn’t the reaction Tracy wanted. She immediately returned the skirt and continued to explore the rack of clothes. <br />
<br />
Melissa did something very similar with what he guessed was some sort of gold sequinned top. She held it against her chest and asked Paul. ‘How do you think I would look in this?’<br />
<br />
Paul though that she would look magnificent in the top. He imagined what it would feel like to feel her breasts through that top. He replied ‘You would look good’<br />
<br />
Melissa considered his answer then turned to Tracy. ‘Do you think this would make me look slutty’<br />
<br />
‘Yeah’ replied Tracy. Melissa returned the top to the rack.<br />
<br />
It was a relief to Paul when they finally departed the shop. The girls had not bought anything.<br />
<br />
After a similar experience in another shop Paul had already had enough. If this was what having a girlfriend was about it was not appealing. He looked at Dave who still had that bewildered look on his face. By now the hand holding had finished. <br />
<br />
The next shop the girls wished to look at was a woman’s dress shop. It was next door to the games store. Paul finally found his voice. ‘Do you girls mind if you check out that store by yourselves. I’d like to show Paul something in here” he pointed at the gaming store.<br />
<br />
Melissa looked at Tracy and shrugged. The two girls went into the boutique alone. Melissa was annoyed at Paul. He was acting like a shy childish boy once more. Clearly he had a problem showing affection in front of his friend. It had been a mistake to have invited Tracy and Dave along. She much preferred the mature Paul she had been with last night.<br />
<br />
Once in the game store Paul took Dave across to the poster advertising the latest NBA 2K version that was due to be released shortly. He told his friend ‘Guess what you will be buying me shortly. As of last night I claim to win our bet’<br />
<br />
Dave’s face betrayed his emotions. Annoyance for a second then joy for his friend. ‘First base?&#39; Paul nodded. &#39;Way to go dude. I thought I was a shoe in. What was it like?’<br />
<br />
Paul described exactly as Mandy had described the experience to him. He actually felt a little guilty to be claiming the bet., but he justified that “Paul” had got a feel so that meant Paul had won the bet. It was just a technicality that his mother had been in charge of the Paul body when 1st base had been achieved.<br />
<br />
Paul felt triumphant when the exited the shop. Dave had put his name down to reserve a game when the stock arrived. He felt like a champion as the waited outside the boutique. When the girls came out he would suggest they went to the food court to have lunch. Remembering his mother’s advice he would even offer to shout Melissa her lunch.<br />
<br />
Whilst in the boutique Melissa confided to Tracy that she had both kissed Paul and let Paul feel her breasts. Tracy had told her on Sunday how she had shared a kiss with Dave. Melissa then complained how Paul seemed to almost be a different person today. ‘He’s showing no affection whatsoever. Do you think it’s because I let him feel me? Did I let him go too far too quickly? Have I ruined our relationship?’<br />
<br />
Tracy gave her friend a cuddle then helped her choose a top. Buying something would help cheer Melissa up. Melissa walked out of the shop with a green pleated top. She liked green as that was her eye colour. She was disappointed that Paul didn’t even enquire about what was in the bag she was holding.<br />
<br />
At least Paul did buy her lunch. He redeemed himself a little bit but then he subsequently lost any good will when he didn’t even give her a hug goodbye. Tracy got a hug and a kiss from Dave but all she got from Paul was a stupid puppy dog look. She ended up giving him a peck on the cheek and he still didn’t respond at all. It was so embarrassing. Was it because Paul no longer liked her or was it because Dave was present and for some stupid reason Paul couldn’t show affection in front of his friend? Boys! Who understood them?<br />
<br />
It was only once she was back home and recalled how great the date had gone last night that she resolved to give Paul another chance. It certainly would not be on a double date.</p>
