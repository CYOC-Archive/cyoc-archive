<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samuel had heard the news like everyone else. Windows were to be closed, no one was to go outside. An emergency lockdown for an unknown reason, but he didn&#39;t mind so long as it kept everyone safe. After all, he was already set on his path of an arts degree. Preparing to write his first novel, and appreciating the quiet time to get it done. The rather scrawny man settling into his room for the foreseeable future, taking time outside it to either shave whatever blond stubble grows, have a nice shower, or a good meal.<br />
<br />
His housemate, Darrel, had taken to this news a bit worse. A sporty man who was looking to be a rising star, his hard work and good looks having scored him a spot on several teams in the past. But a hunger for glory always driving him to seek a better position. Restless, he was unsure what he would do in this new world he found himself in.<br />
<br />
Though as the first week passed, that started to change. Darrel got it in his mind to continue his fitness, using the home as his gym. Sweating, grunting, succumbing. A lust for stink and sex planted in him as the workout continued, his habits starting to affect the home as days passed. Clothes tossed into piles, towels joining them. Stained in sweat or other substances, earthly smelling and pungent. <br />
<br />
It took barely a day for Samuel to notice this putrid aroma that took over his home. Confronting the more confident and bulky Darrel who just laughed the conversation off. Telling his friend that this was natural and good, encouraging him to join in workout. Samuel was disgusted, was this really the guy he had lived with for a year? He tried to ignore it, returning to his room, but still being invaded by that smell.<br />
<br />
Cloth, masks, all coverings unable to stop the scent that had ingrained itself in the house. Samuel barely getting any work done on his book as more time passed, too distracted by that smell, and eventually too enticed. He didn&#39;t know why, but he noticed a sudden shift within himself. A sudden drive to sniff that stink and remain close to his friend. After all, Darrel was the source of this masculine might that has taken over the house.<br />
<br />
For a few days, he continued to ignore it. Thinking it was just delirium from the time spent inside, until his eyes locked on Darrel mid workout. Hairy and rugged body coated in sweat, man grunting in fierce tones, cock throbbing and leaking pre... cock? Darrel was completely naked this time, and Samuel was frozen. He should be disgusted by this, this is his goddamn roommate, but instead all he could feel was his cock throb. Fuck if Darrel wasn&#39;t a stud, he wished he could just walk up to him and stuff his nose against his friends pits. Knowing exactly what was likely to follow from his horny housemate.<br />
<br />
But he resisted, locking himself in his room and knowing something was wrong. Disobeying the orders as he opened the window and let hot air into his room. A  hot breeze that would ordinarily be unpleasant, but now felt like the most welcomed feeling in the world. Air cycled in and out of his room, smell losing potency, and Samuel getting a nights rest.<br />
<br />
Yet when morning came, there was a knock on the door. A police officer, broad and in barely fitting uniform, stood at the entrance. Masked, and speaking to Darrel. The door closing after as Darrel approached his friend and explained that the window was opened. Samuel freezing in place, knowing what would happen if that smell came back, and also finding it already returning from the proximity of Darrel. He was near the source of the scent. Head only a few inches away from his friends sweaty body. His mind hazy as he quickly agreed to whatever Darrel suggested just to end the conversation, only to realise he had just promised to join him for a workout tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Deciding it was now or never, Samuel snuck out of his room that night. Leaving through the window and walking through the abandoned streets. Every house locked tight, hidden from the outside world as those strange happenings were likely affecting them as well. His head clearing with the fresh air, senses and mind restored, until he was quickly found by the cops.<br />
<br />
Detained and brought to the station, locked away with others who had the same idea as him. Waiting, terrified of what fate awaits him, until soon after he is escorted away. Taken to an apartment complex by one of the gruffer guards, walked up the stairs as his detainer knocked on a door, and was greeted by a friendly looking man. Martin in his usual shorts and vest, still spry and strong, still wet from a workout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evening officer, is this the man we&#39;re looking after?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, Samuel, he opened a window. Then snuck out at night. Make sure he doesn&#39;t do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, well come on in, I&#39;m Martin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samuel was glad that his new caretaker seemed friendly enough. But fear reached him once more as he stepped inside. A smell more pungent than Darrel&#39;s filled this house, emanated from the various piles of clothes and towels that littered the room. Martin&#39;s own aroma finding itself in Samuel, but even more being added in second as he looked to the back of the room. Two young adults roughly his age, both as mighty as the homeowner, were hard at workout. Trying to outdo one another as they did push up after push up, their own naked bodies dripping with the result of their training.<br />
<br />
The two stopping shortly after Samuel enters the room, jokingly punching the other on the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;m the real man around here now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fuck off, Harry, you started early.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure I did, Matt, sure I did.&quot;<br />
&quot;Boys, the guys arrived.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two immediately look over, before rushing to greet their new roommate. Martin introducing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Samuel, he&#39;ll be staying in your room Harry. Samuel, this is Harry and Matt, my kids.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good to meet you!&quot;<br />
Harry says with a smile, a surprising innocent and pure look to the man despite his appearance matching the rest of the brutes in the house.<br />
&quot;Yeah, good meeting you. We train everyday, so you better join us sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Added the other, Matt. A more cocky and competitive grin finding itself expressed. Though Samuel knew that a workout was bad news, and knew that being assaulted from this stench from all sides was just asking for him to lose himself. That virile, macho stench. So similar between the three family members, with just a difference in intensity from each one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, uh, I need to unpack though. Going to get that done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samuel blurted out before being pointed to and rushing into his new room. The small space stained with the same stink as the rest of the house, and cluttered with just as many used clothes and towels. This is bad, even a night here would make it hard to resist these three men. But what other choice did he have? The room&#39;s windows were boarded up, so he found no point in worrying. He eventually calmed himself, and started to unpack.</p>
