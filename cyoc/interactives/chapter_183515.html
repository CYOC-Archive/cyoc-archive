<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lights turned on in the hotel room and as they did Barbara was looking right at the large floor to ceiling mirror which sat by the bathroom door. It was there to allow the visitor to check themselves before leaving and now she was checking herself out. <br />
<br />
She expected to see the tall 6’1 woman with long blonde hair down to the small of her back, fair skin, a strong core coming from years of boxing/kick boxing lessons with her father, wearing her normal orange sports bra which held her D almost E sized breasts in check and a pair of black shorts. That would be what she normally saw every morning. It is not what she saw now.<br />
<br />
She still had the blonde hair; however it was now much brighter to an almost golden blonde color and coming out of her hair where two long horns which curved back and upwards to small points. They where a deep rich golden bronze color. Her face remained the same but at her neck golden bronze scales began to appear, they appeared in patches at first but got thicker around her bust line and around her forearms. She couldn’t tell if her breasts where now covered with scales, but her rib cage area certainly was. The scales lessened a bit around her groin area before thickening again around her knees down to her feet. Her feet where no longer human at all, they looked somewhat like a raptor from Jurassic Park, with one large toe raised up with an even larger curved claw on it. She looked at her hands, they were still human, however at each knuckle where small horns which lied flat when her hands where open but when closed came out like spikes. Small spikes/horns where also on her elbows and knees. She took a moment to look down her sports bra top and saw that while the scales did run up the sides of her breasts on either side from her throat area down it she was human. <br />
<br />
Then she noticed something moving over her shoulders, she turned a bit and saw that somehow, maybe it was because of all the drinking she had done the night before but she failed to notice she now had bat like wings, covered with golden bronze scales and bright yellow skin. They folded up to rest little horns on her shoulders and stopped around her knees. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Barbara...she should be freaking out, panicking but she wasn’t. It was strange, she didn’t know what she was, a half dragon came to mind, but she wasn’t sure. However, she couldn’t help but feel powerful, with all the horns, spikes and her own natural training as a boxer/kick boxer she was unstoppable. <br />
<br />
“Barbara?” inquired a soft voice behind her, she turned to look toward Stacy her girlfriend. Neither of them had come out to their parents/families however she expected her father knew the truth as did their friends. She was worried something dreadful had happened to Stacy, she was a slime women, a mindless animal or something else. Instead, she saw a tall beautiful cat women, no judging by the pattern of the fur Stacy was a black panther or a black jaguar. She was still mostly human, with a human like face, however like Barbara she had patches of black fur over the parts of the body she could see. Stacy slept normally in a gown but that had ripped a bit as a long…long flexible black cat tail moved behind her. Her human ears were gone instead replaced by pointed cat ears which poked out of her head, they even had her earrings in them. She had claws on each of her fingers and when she stood up, she looked a lot thinner, she was always thin but now she looked a lot more flexible. Her feet were also tipped with claws and before her eyes long sharp claws came out of each of her fingers before shooting back within her body. <br />
<br />
“Stacy?” inquired Barbara, she should have been horrified of what happened to her girlfriend, yet strangely she wasn’t. Maybe it was the shock of seeing herself, but Stacy looked just a beautiful now, in a different way than she did as a human. “Are you alright?”<br />
<br />
“I have been better.” Announced Stacy as both turned to look at their friends, there was a second mirror by the door which was were Lindsay and Elizabeth where.<br />
<br />
At first, they thought Elizabeth had come out human, she was always the smallest friend of their group being only 5’2 but she looked even shorter now. Her light blonde hair was gone, having been replaced with pure snow-white hair which stopped around her shoulder blades. Long…very long pointed ears shot out of her hair line, and she looked impossibly thin, like on death’s door thin but her color looked greats. Then they noticed that the reserve women who wore a full-length night shirt even in this heat was nude, her small breasts where about the same size but looked larger on her thinner frame and coming out of her back where set sets of dragonflies like wings which had pieces of blue and white mixed in to the see through skin. She turned and looked at them, her eyes where impossibly blue.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” she said in a musical voice, as the wings moved back and forth behind her lifting her off the ground a couple of inches. She had become some sort of fairy, not a small fairy but she was now around 4ft now instead of 5 ft, it wasn’t much of a change, but it was still noticeable. <br />
<br />
“Lindsay?” inquired Barbara as she looked toward her sister, technically they where stepsisters but they had lived together since they where both 5 years old so they where sisters in all but blood. <br />
<br />
“Barbara?” inquired Lindsay, she looked somewhat like her old self, however her entire body was now covered with red and white fur. Her face had pushed out into a short muzzle and her ears where now on the top of her head. Her natural red hair, a trait she shared with her mother. She had become a fox human, she thought of her as a furry however suddenly she noticed that instead of a single tail, multiple tails came out from behind her sister, a nine tailed fox each tail with a white tip.<br />
<br />
“Lindsay?” inquired Barbara as all four of them just looked around at each other not sure what to do.<br />
<br />
“Girls?” yelled their mother over the phone only to have the phone line go dead. Barbara tried to dial again, but there was no bars, the cell lines had just gone down.<br />
<br />
“Ah…what do we do?” inquired Stacy as the sound of sirens, screams, gunshots and the roars/screams of the whole city who found themselves now turned into mythical creatures.</p>
