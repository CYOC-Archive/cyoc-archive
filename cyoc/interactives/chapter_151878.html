<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the drama with the kidnappers, EVERYONE had wanted to just settle down and just live their lives. Myra was still offering miracles for a price, but she&#39;d been doing that for centuries and would be doing it for centuries more. But thanks to the doll maids, her reputation proceeded her, meaning only those who knew what they were getting into really bargained with her anymore.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Curt had come to fully trust Anna and Skyla&#39;s judgement on who to retcon into the sisterhood.  Skyla had taken this chance to increase the number of lionesses in the Security Squad.  While Curt would rather she used the “target’s favorite” setting, to insure any new maids at least end up a species they’d prefer, rather than having their new body picked for them, Skyla, at her core, was a Maid, and as such she wasn&#39;t about to have the security team not being properly complimenting. <br />
<br />
The potential new recruits hadn&#39;t been part of Pam and Cassidy&#39;s old gang, but they had known the girls through Yorick, the less well-adjusted of the two males still left in the gang after Skyla had gotten through with them (the other, kinder one, being Leo). For Anna&#39;s sake, Skyla had, &quot;for security reasons&quot; asked if they were dating anyone, after a resounding &quot;no&quot; Skyla had blasted them, adding two more unusually colored lionesses, one black, one white, (#476, #477) to Pam&#39;s security squad.<br />
<br />
Curt himself hadn’t been changing many more people for the time being, but he did find his feelings for a few of those he had changed, changing.  Especially after both Skyla and Danielle had been fine with “sharing” him...<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
<br />
After church ended, Leeroy picked up Anna for a trip to dinner and the movies (with Cassidy stealthily watching over them both from a safe distance, and Pam scoping out the locations they were visiting ahead of time,)  leaving Curt and Vicky alone on the warm summer afternoon.  The two had decided to take a walk in the park alongside the old creek, listening to the gentle flow of the water.  Curt mentally prepared himself.  He looked at the vixen walking by his side, and took a deep breath. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Vicky?”  He broke the silence.  “You mentioned that you’d ‘had the hots for’ me back in high school…  Do you still feel that way?”<br />
<br />
Vicky quickly turned around from the river to Curt.  “M-Master?  Well, I, ah…”  She stammered, tapping her pointer fingers together nervously, as asking that question had brought her right back to those awkward high-school years.  “I sort of… What I mean…”  She suddenly whispered.  “Yes.”<br />
<br />
Curt had to hold back a laugh.  He’d never seen Vicky this flustered before.  Well, not as far as he remembered, anyway.  “You know Vicky, lately, I’ve been starting to realize, I really don’t give you the attention you deserve.  You’ve been with me from the start, you’ve always put the happiness of others before yourself, worked diligently, and treated everyone with kindness.”<br />
<br />
“M-Master!”  Vicky backed up a few steps, glancing toward the ground.  “ Thank you, You’re so sweet, but I… I mean you… uh…”<br />
<br />
Curt smiled, and put a hand on her shoulder.  “Would you like to start dating?<br />
<br />
Vicky, for the first time in years, was caught completely off guard by Curt.  “If you said ’will you marry me’ it’d still be ‘yes!’”  She said breathlessly, before suddenly covering her mouth.  “I mean…  I mean…  Y-you’re not just doing this to make me happy are you?  Y-you still have Danielle and Skyla…  I don’t want you to force yourself into something if…”<br />
<br />
“Shh.”  Curt held a finger to his lips.  “I AM doing this to make you happy, yes.  Because I love you, and want to be with you.  I want the chance to care for you like you’ve cared for me, over the years.”<br />
<br />
“Master, I…”  Her tail started wagging as Curt hugged her close.  “Yes, I’d be happy to.”<br />
<br />
Curt smiled.  “I knew you’d say that.”<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
“Heh, you’re quite the lucky guy aren’t you?”  Skyla teased, later that evening.  “Not everyone gets to have two foxy ladies fawning over him. And I didn’t ever think you’d be bold enough to ask a THIRD girl out.”<br />
<br />
“What can I say, you and all those harem manga you shared with me as a teen have been a bad influence,” Curt joked.<br />
<br />
“Speaking of that…”  Skyla tapped her fingers while trying (and failing) to keep an innocent expression.  “Vicky didn’t happen to mention if she was bi, too, did she?”<br />
<br />
Curt’s mouth was closed, but his face clearly said, “Really?”<br />
<br />
“What?  These things are way more fun when everyone involved enjoys each other’s company!”<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
A less pleasant encounter in Curt’s life started about a week after confessing his feelings to Vicky.  He had been visited by an individual who said he was a dealer with men of Curt&#39;s “financial status,” saying he was able to “provide for their needs.” <br />
<br />
The man explained people who just &#39;stumbled&#39; into their wealth like Curt normally quickly lost it. But Curt hadn&#39;t. Therefore, there had to be something special about him. And that deserved to be &#39;rewarded.&#39; The man said it was obvious that Curt had &#39;special tastes&#39;, and he could provide for them. If Curt had to describe him, meanwhile, the man’s attitude reminded me of the person Betty Green he had been before their zapping.  Curt asked if he was selling artwork, and the man replied he dealt in things that were “much more satisfying.”<br />
<br />
Pam had done a background check on him after their first meeting, and found nothing.  &quot;TOO MUCH nothing!&quot; as she put it. It wasn&#39;t just a matter of no criminal records, his financial records were like ghosts, among other things. <br />
<br />
She realized he was never going to say anything that was incriminating, and if Curt said anything to draw it out, it could be used as blackmail. <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, Curt, after arranging a second meeting, simply zapped him.  He become a nude anthro love-bird with a petite figure (#478), and she had quickly and in terror confessed to everything, mention many powerful people, many being mentioned that shocked Curt to his core. This time Curt let the FBI handle this, as this was MUCH bigger than a single kidnapping ring. <br />
<br />
But, to help the newly-made maid out, Curt temporarily gave the ray gun (with a pre-set species choice) to Sergeant Roberta Hayes, with an order to find two unmarried war vets who wanted to continue working. The two new teenage western dragonesses (#479, #480) became the love-bird maid&#39;s 24-7 bodyguards while she was in protective custody. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Trying to put what could have been a far worse mess out of his mind, Curt sat down in the hot tub by himself, ready to enjoy his weekend.<br />
<br />
“Hey Master,” A familiar voice said.  Curt looked over his shoulder to see the supermodel-esque Susan standing on the entrance to the patio, her brown hair blowing gently in the breeze.  “Mind if I join you?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, er, I mean, no, feel free to.”  He waved her in.<br />
<br />
The vixen carried herself with confidence, even in the brief walk over to the hot tub.  She slipped in right next to her Master, to his surprise, her smooth fur waving gently under the water.  “It’s been way too long since I’ve had a good soak.  Really cleans the coat.  How about you, Master?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, I’m enjoying it.”<br />
<br />
“You know, Master, I’ve always wondered, why bother with the swim trunks out here?  I mean, it’s your property, and none of the neighbors could see you.  All the maids are fine with nudity, and I’m sure quite a few of us wouldn’t mind getting to see a little more of you.”<br />
<br />
Curt blushed deeply.  “I… Uh… I just…”<br />
<br />
Susan smiled and laughed.  “Sorry, Master, I know you’re not as into that….  Which is why I wanted to talk to you today, actually.”  She put an arm around him.  “We’ve known each other for a while now, and you’ve always been a great guy to hang out with.  It’s nice to have a guy who appreciates my body, but doesn’t just stop there.  And you know…  I think we’d make a good couple.”<br />
<br />
“You do?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!  Most guys will just do whatever I ask if thought it meant I’d show just a little interest in them.  As if I couldn’t tell what they’re after,” she chuckled.  “But you were different, even back in high school.  When I asked Vicky for help with something, you volunteered too.  And worked just as hard, whether you thought I was looking, or not.  That attitude was pretty infectious, heh.  Can’t remember the last time I said “no” to a request from you, Master.”<br />
<br />
Curt knew it was probably a lot more than an “infectious attitude” but took the compliment.  “Thanks, Susan.  And believe me, I appreciate it.  But, uh…”  He shook his head, trying to keep his eyes from wandering.    “I’ll admit, I’m kinda surprised.  Never thought I’d… er, be your type.”<br />
<br />
“Love can be a funny thing like that,” Susan smiled, leaning in closer.  “So, Curt, what do you say?  Wanna be a more than friends, or Maid and Master?”<br />
<br />
Curt admitted, knowing the details of Susan’s past made this a little weird…  Especially knowing &quot;she&quot; was married to Kat before the change wiped that out.  But...  If this timeline&#39;s version of her was interested in him, would it really be wrong? Was he goiong to guilt trip himself over who Susan had liked in a different universe?  And still, she had been very considerate and attentive to him since she’d been changed, and he’d be a massive liar to say he didn’t find her incredibly attractive.<br />
<br />
“You know…  Yes,  Yes I would.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Master!”  Susan smirked and suddenly hugged him tight, forcing him into a kiss, which he didn’t resist.  Though he did his best to make sure she didn’t notice the tent in his pants when her bare, fluffy chest pressed against his.  “I’ll be looking forward to our first date.”<br />
<br />
Curt was almost feeling a bit guilty about letting his love life spiral out of control like this again.<br />
<br />
Susan, meanwhile, was proud to have yet another example of her ability to wrap any man around her fingertips.  Especially when she felt like this one might be THE one.</p>
