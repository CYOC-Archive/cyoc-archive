<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shafts of sunlight from the rising sun crept their way in from the window above Alex’s bed. The girl slept soundly, unaware of anything going around her as the door to her room creaked open slowly. The girl’s parents came in with smiles on their faces as they opened their mouths in unison.<br />
<br />
“Happy birthday swee—” Alex’s parents began to say in a happy tone before cutting themselves off abruptly. Just the sudden noise of her parent’s voices caused the girl to wake up as she quickly sat up in bed. Alex rubbed her eyes and saw both of her parents standing by the door to her room with their mouths hanging open and shock on their face. Confused, Alex stretched a bit and tilted her head slightly.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong—w-wait, what’s wrong with my voice?!” Alex squeaked, now too in a panic like her parents.<br />
<br />
The girl looked down at her hands which were now much smaller and had a pudgy look to them. She quickly tossed the small green dress and blanket off of her to reveal that her body was a lot smaller. The clothes she fell asleep in were laying around her much like a blanket would, but they only covered up to her legs.<br />
<br />
Alex’s mother quickly ran over and pulled a blanket over the girl to keep her from being nude. Meanwhile, her father was pacing back and forth with one hand to his forehead. The girl’s mother looked back towards her husband with an uneasy frown as she began to speak.<br />
<br />
“Okay…okay. This is certainly very freaky and strange, but we cannot panic. You need to get to work hon, I’ll stay home for the day and see what I can do about all this.” Her mother spoke in a tone that was calm but had hints of unease to it. <br />
<br />
Mr. Moon nodded and said goodbye to his wife and daughter before heading out of the room, mumbling something as he walked down the hall. Alex’s mother looked back towards her daughter and frowned.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure how or why this happened but we are just going to have to take it step by step, okay sweetie? Just see if you can relax despite now being a baby again, I need to go call in sick for work.” <br />
<br />
Alex’s worried expression turned a bit angry as she looked up at her mother. She tossed the blanket off of her and did her best to get out of her now overly large nightgown. <br />
<br />
“What do you mean by that mom?! I’m a baby again, how do you expect me to just be calm as if I’m okay with this? I’m certainly NOT okay with this!” The girl began to raise her voice as she shouted at her mother, getting a bit upset.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Moon rubbed her daughters head as she shushed her, trying to get her to stop her from freaking out.<br />
“We need to just deal with this as I said, I know it’s very stressful and strange, but we cannot stop our lives and just sit here all day, got it? I need you to cooperate sweetie.” Her motherly spoke with a gentle tone as she continued to rub the girl’s head, with Alex slowly calming down.<br />
<br />
Her mother began to stand back up when she noticed the small green dress on Alex’s bed.<br />
<br />
“Where did you get that dress sweetie? There’s no way that would have fit you as an adult so why would you have this around?”<br />
<br />
“The dress? That was some prank gift Jennifer gave me for my birthday. She thought it was a joke by saying I would need it since I work at the daycare, but she was just being her normal rude self.”<br />
<br />
Her mother stepped around the side of the girl’s bed as she picked up the small green striped dress in her hands.<br />
<br />
“Well it seems that this is the only thing that will fit you with your current size, I’m sorry if it’s embarrassing but you’re going to have to wear this for the day until we get you back to normal or can buy you some new clothing.” <br />
<br />
Alex blushed slightly as she still found the dress pretty cute and seeing as it was the only thing she had, there was no other choice.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean I’ll need it though?” Alex questioned as she sat on her nude rear near the edge of the bed. “I’m not going anywhere today, especially not now that I’m small, I wouldn’t get very far on my own.”<br />
<br />
Alex’s mother looked towards her daughter with unease once again as she walked back towards the front of the bed.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to need to take you with me when I go out today Alex. I can’t let you sit at home even if you have your normal mindset, you’re a baby again and you could get hurt in that small body of yours.”<br />
<br />
Alex opened her mouth to protest but found her mother’s finger being pressed against the front of her lips in an attempt to keep her from speaking.<br />
<br />
“No protest from you sweetie, I have no other choice. Just stay quiet and everyone will just think you’re a baby with her mother.”<br />
<br />
“But I have work mom, what am I supposed to do about that?!” Alex spoke up again, backing up on her bed, away from the edge of it.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to stop by the daycare while we are out today. I will explain that you a sudden change in plans and ended up going away to an out of town college at the last minute and didn’t get to tell them. If they ask any questions about you I will tell them that you are Alex’s little sister is all.” <br />
<br />
Alex grumbled and crossed her arms as she sat. Her mother was right, there was no way she could possibly get out of this situation and there was the only way one to deal with things. She looked down at her small, body once again with a groan.<br />
<br />
“C’mon sweetie, you can’t sit here nude all day. Just cooperate with me and I will get you prepared to head out and then we can buy you some proper supplies for your new body.”<br />
<br />
Her mother went over to the closet in Alex’s room and pulled out a small white sheet that had a bit of thickness to it. She then came back over to her daughter on the bed and pressed a hand gently against the girl’s chest to get her to lie down. Mrs. Moon took the sheet that she grabbed and set it on the bed. <br />
<br />
Using one hand, she grabbed Alex by the ankles and lifted upwards, raising the girl’s butt slightly as she slid the sheet partially under. Her next motions were rather quick as she brought the sheet up to Alex’s waist and then used some of the excess cloth to tie it on both sides. She then motioned for the girl to sit back up as she stepped a few inches away from the bed.<br />
<br />
“There, for now, this sheet will have to act as a cloth diaper for you. I don’t know if you’re still capable of using the bathroom normally so for the time being, this is just a precaution.” <br />
<br />
Alex blushed as she looked down at the sheet, her cheeks turning dark red. Her mother then lifted her arms up as she felt something being pulled over her head. When she was able, Alex looked back down to see that she was now wearing the green striped dress that Jennifer gave her as a joke. <br />
<br />
“Thanks mom…this will have to do for now until things are fixed. I appreciate you helping me out like this.” Alex spoke with a sigh, frowning a bit while looking down at herself, feeling a bit happier now that she was clothed. <br />
<br />
“Of course, Alex, I couldn’t just leave you be and not do anything for you. I raised you once and if I have to I will do it again. We might even still have some of your old baby supplies in the attic like your old crib. I’ll have your father go up there when he gets home from work.”<br />
<br />
Alex nodded slowly and yawned a bit, realizing how early it was still. She continued to look down at herself, thoughts racing through her mind as a blush still lay on her face. While this whole situation was very worrisome and embarrassing, she couldn’t help but feel a little safe and comfortable being dressed and treated like this. <br />
<br />
Mrs. Moon looked back towards her daughter before walking out into the hall. She pulled her cell phone out and began to dial her work’s number, so she could call off of work. Once that was taken care of, she walked back into Alex’s room and went back over to her daughter.<br />
<br />
Alex was still focused on looking at her body, taking in all the changes as well as checking out her dress and make-shift cloth diaper. She wiggled her small legs a bit, looking down at her shoe-less and sock-less feet which were pudgy like her hands. While she was distracted, her mother reached down and placed her hands under the girl’s arms and gently lifted her up. Alex looked up in surprise as her mother cradled the girl in her arms. <br />
<br />
“M-mom, what are you doing? This is SO embarrassing, don’t you need to go get things ready or something?”<br />
<br />
Her mother shook her head and began to walk with Alex down the staircase. She got to the bottom and grabbed her purse that hung from the post at the start of the stairs.<br />
<br />
“I’m already prepared for the day, we are going to head out now, so we can get home as soon as possible.” Her mother opened the door to the outside while she spoke and began to head out.<br />
<br />
“But don’t you have to call a doctor for me or something? We can’t possibly be going out already! I haven’t prepared myself mentally for this!”<br />
<br />
Her mother shook her head as she looked down at her daughter.<br />
<br />
“What do you suppose I would tell the doctor? That my daughter woke up this morning as a baby but went to bed as a 19-year-old girl? They would think I was crazy even if I showed you to them. Unfortunately, we can’t do much about this but wait and maybe research your condition.”<br />
<br />
Alex frowned and groaned as she took all this in as well as heard the door locking from her mother. She crossed her arms as her mother walked towards the car that she drove, a gulp coming from the toddler. The day would be miserable for her, they hadn’t even gone out in public yet and Alex was already embarrassed by the way her mother carried her which showed off the cloth diaper underneath the dress.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Moon set her daughter in the backseat of the car and buckled her in tightly as there was no car seat. Alex placed both of her pudgy hands over her eyes as she let out another groan, hearing the car engine startup.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
