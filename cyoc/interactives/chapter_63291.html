<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean sat with the Chronivac and pulled of his shirt.  He'd gotten a bit too warm so up close and personal with his fattened roommate. He'd tested the waters with Dan enough.  Not only did he enjoy what he was doing to Dan, Dan was enjoying it himself.  Sean never thought he'd live with someone into transformation of any kind, and even though Dan was specifically interested in weight gain, it was something.  Sean wasn't sure if it was the weight piling on Dan that was getting him so worked up, or just the fact that he was transforming him.  He imagined going the distance.  Bloating Dan up to the 500 pounds he used to fantasize about.  He went to fish his member out of his pants to relieve some tension... then stopped.  <br />
<br />
  He could make physical changes.  Didn't he see mental changes as well?  He brought up Dan's profile.  All the data was there. 21 years old, 6 feet tall.  250 glorious, fat filled pounds.  Sean poked around and saw an option &quot;Target aware&quot;  he hovered over it, a description scrolled out.  By turning the option off, Dan would think he was always the size he is currently... that'd probably change Dan's feelings towards being fat though.  He never would have fantasized about it if he hadn't had trouble putting it on.  Next to it, however, was a far more interesting option.  &quot;Universe aware&quot;  it was checked.  Sean hovered over it.  It stated that if unchecked, no one would realize the target was any different than they currently were.  There was also an exception list.  Names added to it would remain aware of the targets original self.  He added his name to the list and unchecked the box.<br />
<br />
  Hopefully that'll take care of any unwanted freakouts about Dan's new girth...  He saw other mental changes he could do.  IQ, which he wasn't going to touch, memory, that sounded dangerous... sexuality?  He brought it up,  It was a little slider.  Dan's slider was at about 60 percent straight, 40 percent gay.  He knew Dan was curious... maybe he should change that curiosity to an almost certainty.  He felt a little sleazy doing it, but soon enough, it was notched upward to a 10 straight 90 gay.  It was a weak moment, but... he really wanted to get closer to Dan now.  One last option on the page sounded like it'd make it a sure thing.  Hormone levels.  They were listed here thanks to the way they could affect the targets mind.  Testosterone, specifically, said a slight increase of a few percent, in the short term, could greatly increase sexual desire.  So, Sean increased it, only by a few percent.<br />
<br />
  That was it for mental changes.  The next physical change he planned for Dan would drive him over the edge with pleasure.  He was sure of it. Dan was about to get the body he used to lay in bed dreaming about.  Sean backed out the 250 and put in 500.  His mind wandered, wondering what Dan would look like at that size.  He clicked save, then realized he hadn't set the time...  &quot;Sh..shit, what's it set to again?&quot;  The timer popped up.  10 minutes.  9:59.  He gulped.  Dan was going to blow up... fast.<br />
<br />
  He had one change to make to himself first.  He was certain this would end with he and Dan doing the deed.  He wanted to see how Dan shook and wobbled while they did it... but Dan was new to being gay.  Probably never bottomed before.  He didn't want to hurt him.  His roughly 14 inch hardon was a bit much for someone like Dan, so selflessly (or selfishly, more likely), Sean reduced it to 5 inches hard.  Then he heard a shout &quot;S-Sean!  It's happening again!  Fast!&quot;   There was a tint of panic in the shout.  Sean clicked save and darted from his seat, feeling his package shifting and jeans getting roomier as he made his way down the hall.<br />
<br />
There was Dan, grasping his belly as it surged into his hands.  A minute in and already 25 good pounds heavier. &quot;F-Fuck... it's happening so fast!  I'm growing too quick!&quot;  He shouted.  Another 2 or so pounds on him before he got the sentence out.  Sean rushed over, holding his stomach, feeling it swelling in his hands.  Dan was swelling at an alarming pace.  Another minute in and he was over 300, expanding continuously.  His chest plumped fatter and fatter, his ass widened.  His gut got heavier in Sean's hands.  He was moaning, not with pain, but with pleasure.  His arms thickened, his thighs touched about halfway down to his knee.  His face was plumping and rounding out.<br />
<br />
  He was softening all over, grunting to adjust his stance as the flab poured in. A roll appeared under his arms as his chest thickened.  Another bunched at his hips as he past 375.  Sean was awestruck, watching his once skinny roommate turning into the type of guy you see on TV specials about how America is obese. 400 came and went.  His belly draped down over his crotch somewhat, his thighs touched almost all the way to the knee.  He looked so wide, and only growing wider.  &quot;God... seeing you porking out like this.  This is too hot!  I'm having a hard time keeping myself from just jumping you, man.&quot;  Dan's response was delayed, overwhelmed with the sensation of what was going on.  &quot;I... nnf.... I think... I'm gonna let you in a minute.  My cock is fucking throbbing.  I need to get some, bad...&quot; he said before moaning. 450 passed.  Dan was incredibly big.  The weight still streaming in, plumping him larger and larger.  He must be as wide around as he was tall.  Every slight motion he made was exaggerated by his heavy, bulging body.  Then... it just stopped.  Completely.  The second the 10 minutes was up, he was done.<br />
<br />
  Spent from his expansion, Dan flopped back onto his bed.  The metal frame groaned loudly, the mattress sagged beneath him.  He lay there, arms outstretched, fat chest rising and falling.  Sean stood over him, grinning.  Dan was absolutely huge.  his gut was dominating most of his upper body, but his arms and chest had fattened out nicely.  His thighs were impressively big... and between them, what was still visible of his impressive package.  Impressive when he was thin, maybe.  Now just the tip was visible from the fat piled around it.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Wow.&quot;  Was all Sean could say.  He surveyed every curve of ample flesh Dan had gained.  He was quiet for a minute.  &quot;Dan.  I gotta say.  You're fucking hot to me right now.&quot;  Dan laughed.  &quot;I feel hot.  Seriously.  I know it's probably insane to feel sexy when I'm this damn fat... but I do.  I want to take this body for a spin... so, looks like you're going to get your chance, slim.&quot;  He said with a grin.  He gave his stomach a light slap and then said &quot;Well, come on now.&quot;  With another laugh.  Sean fumbled with his belt and buttons, sliding his jeans and boxers off to the floor, stepping out of them, catching a quick glimpse of his fully hard 5 inches in the mirror before he walked over and positioned himself between Dan's mammoth thighs.  With some maneuvering, he pushed in as deep as he could manage... maybe 5 inches was a bit too small after all, but he managed.  Soon he was pumping and thrusting into his inflated roommate, watching as Dan's belly slid up and down, his tits bounced.  <br />
<br />
  Sean couldn't hold the wry smile back as he stared at his handiwork.  His lithe roommate had been utterly changed in a matter of hours, leaving him in an overfilled body, covered in thick slabs of fat that shook and jiggled as Sean fucked him. Sean's fingers pressed into the plush flesh on Dan's sides.  He could feel the quakes of his gut having the shock absorbed by his beefy arms.  Sean had DONE this to him.  He felt amazing!  &quot;Fuck Dan, you're a real doughboy now, aren't you?&quot;  He said between thrusts, panting, watching the jiggling form of Dan as he moaned and writhed. &quot;Can't believe you used to be skinny!  Shit, you're enormous now!&quot;  Dan moaned and nodded again.  &quot;You love it, don't you fatboy?  You fucking love being a blob!&quot;  Sean pumped in faster and deeper, Dan shaking even faster.  &quot;Fuck I love your body like this.  Blimped out huge...&quot;  He looked down just in time to see Dan shoot his load all over the underside of his belly.  Sean wasn't far behind, letting out his own torrent into Dan.<br />
<br />
  They both lost their tension, slumping and panting a bit.  Dan was the first to talk &quot;sh...shit, you called me a blob... fuck, I'm a blob!  I shouldn't be getting off on this!&quot;  He shouted as he struggled to sit up, holding his huge belly. &quot;Fuck, if it's permanent... I can't hit the gym... can't get this stuff off... I can't even take long walks.  I'm gonna be out of shape, hauling all this fucking fat around!  What am I gonna do?  What if I'm not done growing?!&quot;  Sean grabbed him by his fat face and pulled him close, planting a kiss on his lips.  &quot;So what if you're a blob.  You like being a blob, fatass...&quot;  he said playfully.  Dan frowned slightly, but it was erased when Sean kissed him again.  &quot;And so what if you get out of shape.  You've got me around to help you if you reach your limits... and if you get any fatter, I'll help you then too. Every pound just makes you hotter to me, big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Dan swallowed hard and made a slight smile.  &quot;Guess I gotta break up with Steph, huh?&quot;</p>
