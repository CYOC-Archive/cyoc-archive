<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Henry awoke to his alarm clock beeping away with a groan. His head was aching and he needed a moment to focus, as slowly the events of last night drippled in. He felt a bit disgusted by himself. He really shouldn’t drink that much – doing nasty stuff like that really wasn’t him. Besides, on a Monday… His eyes snapped open. Monday. That means today is Tuesday! He looked at his alarm clock and groaned again. Oh shit! He slept in for almost an hour. He’d have to run even to make it to his first meeting. <br />
<br />
Henry stumbled out of bed and into his clothes. On the way to the flat door, he passed the bathroom door, which was still open. Apparently, Josh had been so drunk, he had fallen asleep right there on the floor, snoring as he was curled up next to the plumbing. <br />
Well, it was not that he had time to take a shower anyway, so he didn’t need to wake him. Besides, he certainly didn’t need to have the talk about yesterday’s events just yet. With that thought, Henry darted out of the door.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t a pleasant day at work to say the least. He barely made it to his meeting, which went okay – but that really was the only good thing on this day. Afterward, his boss came to see him, telling him off for not having shaved before such an important meeting. Henry was confused. He had shaved Saturday and really didn’t grow much of a beard, so he should be fine for another week. But he just nodded and tried not to show his confusion. After having finally having arrived at his desk, he went straight to the restroom to check.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Josh slowly awakened. His body was aching, which was no surprise, as he had apparently slept on the cold tiled floor. It took him a moment to realize what he was doing there, but the foul taste in his mouth helped him out quickly. Right. It probably had been a beer too many. Originally, he wanted to lead the evening further, but apparently, he fell asleep after the watersports event – which was okay for Josh, although next time he’d much prefer to be the dominant part there.<br />
He shrugged and went into the shower to take a morning piss, not caring to really shower. He usually didn’t shower more than once a week anyway and went back to the living room, clearing his throat. <br />
As expected after drinking, his throat was rather dry, so he took another sip from one of the half-empty beer cans on the table. It didn’t really help much and he let his eyes wander over the mess that was the living room. Henry had much to do to tidy that up, he shrugged, and made himself comfortable on the couch, starting up the game console.<br />
<br />
Stubble. He sported a thin layer of stubble on his chin. Henry blinked. That was unusual. Well, he would have to shave this evening. Perhaps he had remembered wrong and his last shave had been longer ago. Nothing he could fix right there, however, and there were more pressing matters at hand. Henry didn’t have the time for his usual morning routine, and with the plumbing situation at home, he much preferred his office restroom anyway. Slowly, he started to find his inner peace again. Time to get things sorted out, he thought, as he went into one of the stalls.<br />
<br />
However, that inner peace wasn’t long lived, as he sat on the cold porcelain. Nothing was happening. Henry felt that he needed to go, but as he sat on the toilet, not a single drop of urine would leave his body. He waited and pressed, even defecating (which didn’t seem to be a problem), but he just couldn’t manage to urinate, not even a bit. Frustrated, he wiped and pulled up his pants after a while and went back to work. He’d just have to try again soon. <br />
However, although by the time his shift ended Henry was wiggling in his chair with his bladder filled to the brim, he just couldn’t get himself to shed a single drop into the office urinal or toilets. Henry was completely at loss. Perhaps he should see a doctor, he thought, as he hurried home, taking all his self-control not to empty his bladder right there on the street (although he wasn’t even sure that would work).<br />
<br />
When he arrived home, Josh was again gaming in the living room. Henry was not exactly surprised to see yesterday’s beer cans and pizza boxes still lying around, scattered over the table and floor. Josh wasn’t known for his tidiness. At least today he seemed to have drunken mostly water, as he saw two empty bottles on the table.<br />
<br />
As Henry came home, Josh was, again, clearing his throat. He didn’t understand why, but he was feeling parched. Sure, he’d drunk plenty of water, tried beer, even milk, but the dry feeling in his throat just wouldn’t go away. It was like he hadn’t drunken anything the whole day. When Henry entered the door, Josh’s eyes were immediately drawn to him, or, to be more precise, his crotch. It felt to him like he was dying of thirst and the only water in the vicinity was right there, behind this zipper. But then again, without lots of alcohol, Henry surely wouldn’t do *that* again. <br />
He cleared his throat again as Henry began to speak, barely having entered the flat: <br />
“Hi Josh. Uh, about yesterday evening… I… think we should just…” <br />
Josh could see that Henry was still deeply ashamed about what happened, so he took the initiative: <br />
“Ya, it was fun, wasn’t it? No worries! In fact, if you want, we could do it again sometimes” <br />
and grinned at Henry. He was pretty certain that would never happen, but at least Henry didn’t need to feel bad about it.<br />
“Oh. O-okay.” Henry replied, and then, again flushing red, “H-how about right…now?”<br />
<br />
Josh couldn’t believe his ears. That was not the Henry he knew. Not thinking about his resolution not being the one on the receiving end again and just driven by his thirst, Josh basically jumped of the couch, not even pausing the game. <br />
“Ya sure, if you want” he said with barely contained greed as he went to the bathroom. It wasn’t all thirst, as he felt himself getting rock hard again while kneeing on the cold tiles, right in front of the pipes sticking out of the floor. Without thinking twice about it, he opened up his own pants, fondling his cock through his boxers while waiting for Henry to arrive.<br />
Henry was surprised and more than a bit disgusted by himself, but he couldn’t help it. The pressure in his bladder was becoming really unbearable and he had the faint hope that this at least could work. If not, well, it would only add to his humiliation. <br />
As he arrived in the bathroom, Josh was already on the floor and he was – Henry decided to lock his eyes to his buddies face – fondling his obviously hard cock through his underwear. Josh was enjoying this far too much, he decided, but then again, Josh has always been rather perverse. <br />
However, there were more pressing matters to attend to, as he zipped open his jeans. To his dismay, he could already see a few yellow drops leaking into his clean white underwear, as he quickly pulled that down and aimed his dick towards his buddies open mouth. <br />
This time, there was no being careful at first, and a thick stream of piss hit Josh’s mouth and even spilled a bit to his chin, as Josh obviously didn’t manage to gulp it down fast enough.<br />
<br />
Josh felt in heaven, as Henry’s piss hit him like a water hose. His dry throat eagerly soaked up the liquid and even though the taste was as disgusting as he expected, just having something to drink made it all alright. He didn’t even care that some dropped to his chin, as he just gulped it down greedily. He needed more of this, so he opened his mouth wider and wider. After a bit, he discovered, that if he didn’t actively swallow and just let the human waste liquid run down his throat on its own, he could manage not to spill so much, which meant more for him. <br />
Although the sensation was extremely exciting for him, he had even stopped working his package – completely focused on the yellow acrid liquid entering him and making a gurgling sound in his belly.<br />
<br />
For Henry, it was the most relieving feeling he had all day. Finally, he could urinate, no, piss like a racehorse, he thought to himself. His friend Josh did an excellent job. After a while, he couldn’t even hear him gulping anymore and with his closed eyes, it felt like using one of the office urinals. It felt like an eternity before his stream began to subside and he opened his eyes. Josh kneeled before him, completely motionless with his mouth opened wide, almost incredibly wide. It looked as if he wouldn’t even be able to cover it with one of his big hands right now. His whole face looked pale and didn’t move at all, the eyes still hungrily fixated on Henry’s dick.<br />
<br />
“Phew, thanks buddy!” Henry said, but Josh didn’t answer. Shrugging his shoulder, he left the bathroom. It crossed his mind that this was rather unusual for him – normally he would be worried about Josh not answering, but right now, he just felt good. Well almost. He looked down at his marked underwear. He would need to pull on a new one. On his way to his room, another crazy thought crossed his mind. <br />
“Hey Josh”, he called, “mind if I borrow one of your boxers?” <br />
As no answer came, he just shrugged his shoulder and entered Josh’s room. There were no clean boxers, but one on one of the floor heaps that looked sufficiently less-worn. Without thinking much, Henry stepped out of his thighty-whitey, just letting it drop to the floor to one of the piles of cloth and pulled on the used boxer. As he was about to pull up his jeans, he decided otherwise. He could probably chill around in just boxer and t-shirt this evening.</p>
