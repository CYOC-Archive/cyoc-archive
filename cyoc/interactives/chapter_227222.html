<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric and Ty stood over the defeated bandit leader, breathing heavily but otherwise unharmed.  She was tied to the tree she had been slouched against early, but now bruised and beaten.  The rest of her crew lay scattered about the battlefield, pummeled or otherwise stabbed, although the pair of friends had been sure not to kill anyone.  Turns out, the two of them, with their character’s stats, were more than a match for some regular bandits on the road.  They hoped to find the rest of their friend’s, seeing as a party of four would fair even better in this world.  <br />
<br />
A cough brought their attention back to the half-orc.  She was staring up at them defiantly and spat at their feet.  “S’what, you two was tougher than you looked.  Fool on me, yeah, but you two don’t know how messed you are now.  Once I and my mates  recover, we’re gonna find you, and I’ll make you and any of your friends pay.  My cock will be fit to burst, you hear?”<br />
<br />
Ty sighed, butEric nudged him.  “Yo, Ty, I think she kind of means it.  I kind of don’t want a loose thread chasing us around this place, but I am very uncomfortable with killing dudes.  Got any plans?”<br />
<br />
Ty had to agree, he did not really want to kill anyone either, but he also couldn’t just leave a group of thieves hunting them down.  He thought for a few seconds, before he spotted the potion bottle next to the half-orc.  It had fallen out during the scuffle and its cork was already halfway out.  He then looked to the defeated bandits, their bodies strewn about, as well as their supplies.  And food.  His stomach grumbled.  The gamer side of his brain lit up.  “Hey, Eric, I think I have an idea.”  Eric raised an eyebrow.  “Since we are in a fantasy world, with fantasy tabletop rules it would seem, I think it might behoove us to do some looting, right?”  Eric nodded, catching on.  “Unfortunately, there’s no GM to clean up the bodies once were done, but I think we can hit two birds with one stone.  We can grab the gold and food from these guys, and use their own medicine against them to incapacitate them.”<br />
<br />
Eric pointed to the bottle.  “You mean the potion?”<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, feeling the multiple genitals in his face jiggle with the gesture.  “Exactly.  If it works the way I think it does, we can reduce this issue to just one bandit.  Maybe even less…”<br />
<br />
Eric nodded, “Kind of fucked up, sure.  But, I guess she was prepared to do the same to us.”<br />
<br />
Eric grabbed the potion as Ty picked up one of the bandits laying next to them.  The leader laughed as Eric ripped the thong off her cock and let the uncut meat flop to the grass.  It was nearly to her knees even when soft, and it twitched as Eric hefted it up.  “What’ this, gone mad on me?  Gonna join my cock are you?  Well just pour some on the sausage and wrap lips around it if that’s your plan.  Your mad!”<br />
<br />
“Nope.  But thanks for telling us how it works” said Ty.  “We’re going to try this instead.”  Eric popped the cork off the potion and poured some on the green cock. Ty then brought the woman’s lips up to the cock, which almost seemed to be attracted as by a magnet.  Her lips were quickly latched around the dick, and the merging process accelerated quickly from there.  Her body mass seemed to merge with the skin of the dick, pouring into it quickly as the cock itself grew, and grew.  In just a few seconds the woman’s entire body had been absorbed by the half orc’s dick, increasing its size by nearly half such that it reach down to the leader’s calves, and her balls were similarly enlarged as well.  A little tuft of dirty brown hair now occupied the leaders crotch.  <br />
<br />
The bandit leader was stunned.  “Wh-what are you?”  But Eric quickly stuffed her mouth with a sock from the remains of the absorbed woman’s clothing.  Ty set about grabbing the next bandit, a man, and performing the process again.  The leader struggled, but there was no helping it.  Her cock grew bigger still, reaching just past her feet and now was thicker than her leg.  The next bandit fed to the cock made it larger than the woman was tall, and the final three seemed to just make it bigger rather than longer, while her balls were now so massive that even standing her legs would be spread apart by their size.  By all indications, she was immobilized by her own cock.  But Ty and Eric weren’t done yet.  If they had learned anything from their own changes, it is that this world was ruthless when it came to mutating people, and they figured they shouldn’t hold back either.  They also figured this next step would make it harder for the woman to track them down if she ever recovered.  Eric pulled the cloth out of the half-orc’s mouth, letting her unleash a tirade of profanity the two friends could only half understand.  <br />
<br />
Quickly, Ty hefted the now much heavier cock as Eric poured out the remains of the bottle on it.  He then pushed the head of it in the direction of its master, who began to scream as the massive foreskin engulfed her head.  The two watched in morbid fascination as the cock began to undulate oddly, almost as though it was sucking.  It worked its way down her body, engulfing her head, shoulders, arms, then finally stopped once it had reached her waist.  There was a silent moment when everything stopped moving, and then the cock lurched forward and slammed back down on the grass, leaving nothing atop the leader’s waist but empty clothing and fresh greenish skin covering the top of her body where her torso should have been.  Looking down at the cock head, the pair were shocked to discover something poking out from the foreskin.  The orcs hair was spilling out.  Peeling it back, the duo saw what had become of the woman; her head had fused with and replaced the cock-head of her dick.  They were about to ask her how she felt when her eyes sprang open and her mouth bugled just before she shout out a torrent of cum from her lips.  <br />
<br />
Collecting all the food, water, and coin they could find, Ty and Eric left the cock on legs to her own devices, able to hear her orgasmic cries for several minutes as they walked away…</p>
