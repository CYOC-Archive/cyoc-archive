<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, Trev,&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Trevor, Trevor, Trevor. How could anyone be so wrong?&quot; Every time Kyle mentioned his name, Trevor felt the stone changing him, although for the most part he couldn&#39;t tell what was different. His hair was definitely longer, and his previously short trekking boots now went up to his knee, but that were the only obvious changes he could see without a mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;re you two arguing about now?&quot; asked Ike, who kept walking a few paces ahead of his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trev here says that Grand Cross 2 is better than Grand Cross 3, even though everybody else on the face of the planet knows that&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for having taste,&quot; Trevor said shrugging his shoulders. &quot;Guess I&#39;m a weirdo for thinking actual good level design is more important than cheap gimmicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget I asked,&quot; grumbled Ike, who didn&#39;t share the other two guys&#39; interest in video games.<br />
<br />
&quot;One day,&quot; said Kyle, &quot;we&#39;ll have to make you play both those games just so you see how deeply wrong Trev is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the dude who likes escort missions,&quot; said Trevor. His chest tingled again.<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
True to Trevor&#39;s promise, the trio arrived back at the cabin right as the sun was setting. Along the way, Kyle had said his name many times, enough for Trevor to lose count, with only a couple of utterances from Ike. Dying of curiosity over his new form, Trevor quickly said that he wanted to use the bathroom first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Without me?&quot; asked Ike. The cute look of confusion on his face made Trevor&#39;s heart skip a beat, but he had other things on his mind for the time being.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not gonna take a shower, I&#39;ll just... take care of some business.&quot; Thankfully, implying that he needed to poop didn&#39;t seem to trigger the stone&#39;s power.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Trevor stated, &quot;There is a full-length mirror on the wall,&quot; as he shucked off his clothes. He then inspected himself in the mirror that wasn&#39;t there just a few seconds earlier. The changes were significant, although maybe not dramatic. He still saw his old features on his face, but overall he was better looking and free from blemishes. His hair, as he notices on the hike, was now long, reaching down to his mid-back — he wouldn&#39;t have guessed that was Kyle&#39;s preference, but he kind of liked it. Previously somewhat mousy, it was now a rich chestnut color, and it was tied back in a loose ponytail.<br />
<br />
His body still had some muscle, but overall it was a lot more slender and lithe. His shoulders were broad — Ike&#39;s influence, perhaps? — but his arms and thighs weren&#39;t too thick. Turning around, Trevor appreciated his new ass, which was not too big but very well-shaped. His body hair was sparse, and his new look was a bit androgynous, although he doubted he could pass as a woman. Looking at his cock (which was already half hard), Trevor saw that it was a little longer and more than a little thicker. That&#39;s right, he thought, Kyle loves sucking dick now, so he probably wants more meat to work with.<br />
<br />
Remembering Kyle&#39;s little hand kink, he looked at his hands. Sure enough, they were rather large and long-fingered, with slender digits that gave off a sense of precision and strength.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door. &quot;You almost done, Trev?&quot; asked Kyle, activating the stone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be out in a minute,&quot; said Trevor. It seemed that he didn&#39;t change physically, but there was a shift in the pile of clothes on the floor. His wish had been kind of vague, so he thought it was interesting that it was affecting more than just his body. As he redressed, he noted that his formerly blank t-shirt now had a logo on the chest, belonging to a band he only had a vague recollection of.<br />
<br />
Leaving the bathroom, Trevor noticed that there was now an acoustic guitar on his bed. He never learned how to play the guitar, but now he realized his mind was full of chords and melodies, and his fingers were automatically moving to form well-practised grips. The final piece of the puzzle fell into place: Kyle&#39;s ideal man was a musician. This was surprising to Trevor, as he never knew Kyle was into musicians, but he was excited to try out his new long-haired, guitar-playing persona.<br />
<br />
The next thing on his agenda was using his new body to seduce Kyle.</p>
