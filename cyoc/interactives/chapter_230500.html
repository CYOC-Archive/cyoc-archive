<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a little over two weeks since he&#39;d used the Chronivac to undo what he&#39;d done to himself. In a few days he&#39;d have his seventeenth birthday, and about a week and a half afterward, school would start on the second of September. But none of this was foremost on Patrick&#39;s mind. Instead, his thoughts he found continuously strayed to back to how he&#39;d spent almost the past year. Having gotten rid of the breasts he&#39;d given himself, and reverted his body back to way it had been before he made such drastic changes, he&#39;d believed everything would go back to way it was before, yet found it wasn&#39;t as simple as he&#39;d thought.<br />
<br />
The use of the Chronivac to give him nuts instead ovaries, to flatten out his chest, and the restore what body hair he&#39;d previously had, hadn&#39;t been an issue. The changes had happened as swift as he figured out how to tell the programme to make them, and with a bit of tinkering, had managed to make the transformation not at all discomforting. In addition, he reverted reality, but kept it so only he was aware of any changes, which caused his bedroom to lose all the feminine aspects it had, and his clothes to revert to what he normally wore in the summer months. Believing everything was back to way it had been, with the exception he no longer needed glasses, he saved the changes, locked his profile, and closed out the application.<br />
<br />
Yet, things hadn&#39;t gone as he thought. Over the next couple days, as he tried to grow accustomed to no longer needed to sit to pee, having to use the men&#39;s restroom, and not possessing a set of tits, Patrick found something seemed off. Trying to ignore it at first didn&#39;t help, and when he focused his attention on it, his mother would often ask him if anything was the matter, as well as state, &quot;You seem distracted.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t sure how to tell his mum, let along what he should tell her, of the last eight plus months. Smiling, he offered the excuse, &quot;Normal teenage stuff,&quot; and was thankful when she didn&#39;t press the subject at the moment.<br />
<br />
After almost a week of trying to get back into the groove of living life fully as a guy, it soon came to him what was off. The big thing he found was it seemed like he was now missing a part of himself. Worried he&#39;d made some unwitting change when using the Chronivac, he also tried to tell himself it was only in his mind, that he&#39;d grown used to have boobs and dressing like a girl and doing things with the girls in his class year, and it was nothing else. Yet, he was unable to make himself believe this. Trying to go back to hanging out with his friends, he found there wasn&#39;t the closeness he got when he hung out with a girl, and the topics they&#39;d once loved to engage in, Patrick now found himself distant from, as well as they seemed lacking, almost immature.<br />
<br />
And it wasn&#39;t merely Patrick who noticed this. After a few times of meeting up with and trying to hang around his friends, they soon accused him of being a jerk and trying to ditch them. This had led to several rows between them before Patrick told them, &quot;You&#39;re nothing but a bunch of whiny assholes,&quot; before storming off, telling them as he left they could call him when they took their heads out of their ass.<br />
<br />
Distant now with his friends, finding he felt like he was missing something, Patrick started to grow despondent, as well as feel there was something wrong with him. This was made worse when the dreams started again. Trying to be embarrassed by them, and finding it was hard to, he soon become even more convinced the programme had mucked him up worse than he&#39;d assumed, as the dreams which bothered him were always of the erotic nature, and usually involved him going down on a guy, or having sex with a male, and always as a girl.<br />
<br />
Bothered, he tried to tell himself, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a girl. I&#39;m not attracted to dudes,&quot; he found it didn&#39;t help, as the words sounded false, and left him feeling even more like he was incomplete, he was denying something about himself.<br />
<br />
Finally to the point he was unable to take it anymore, Patrick booted up his computer and opened the Chronivac app. Entering the password for his profile, he considered making changes to it. But, unsure what he ought to alter, he instead settled on carefully going over it, then went over it a second time. Not finding anything to indicate why he felt the way he did, as well as the reason why it seemed everything seemed to be turned on its side since he&#39;d last used the programme, he huffed in agitation. Believing there must be something, he had it rescan him before he began to dig deeper. Opening submenus, accessing hidden menus, he soon started to find things about himself he thought it wasn&#39;t possible. Questioning why somethings were greyed out, and couldn&#39;t be altered, it was quite by accident when he found, buried deep in a section about his personality and subconscious, a setting about his sexuality.<br />
<br />
Not sure how to take what he saw, he leaned back in the desk chair. Pensive, he wasn&#39;t sure it was believable when the Chronivac listed him as being gay. Thinking about, he found he didn&#39;t have an issue with the idea of a person being sexually attracted to someone of the same sex and gender as they were, but wondered how accurate it was to say he was. So far as he knew, he liked girls, or so he kept telling himself,<br />
<br />
The problem was, the more he gave it any consideration, thought back over his own life, there was questions he soon started to have. Thinking maybe he ought to toggle it so he was straight, Patrick found he was unable to bring himself to do so. Believing by make such a change, it was somehow a lie, as well as insulting on a number of levels, not all of which he was able to grasp and fully understand. Considering next the idea of making himself a teenage girl fully, &quot;Rather than merely giving myself a hairless body, breasts, and ovaries instead of testes,&quot; he reasoned, he baulked at the notion. Wanting to believe he didn&#39;t want to be female, didn&#39;t need to be a girl, there was something about the train of thought he found lacking, and after some time he thought what he might not want to be, at the moment, was a teenage girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too much of a complication,&quot; he muttered as he exited out of the menu he was in, and thinking it&#39;d be like someone throwing themselves in the deep end of the pool in order to learn to swim, he saved his profile and closed the programme.<br />
<br />
With a quick glance at the computer&#39;s clock and calendar, Patrick mulled over his options a bit before deciding, &quot;I&#39;ll decide by my seventeenth birthday,&quot; and feeling satisfied he was making the best choice he was able to, he clicked on the internet icon and navigated to a social media website.</p>
