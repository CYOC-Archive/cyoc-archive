<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chloe made her case as she watched the image of his Lord Sealina, his facial expression was able to inform her that she was making some progress. He listened to her talk about Tim, Ana and herself had not been the 1st to be transformed by this merchild and was in fact caught by accident in this whole affair. She tried to convince the Lord to let all of them go and let the child become either a human or stay with another mercouple however the look on his face told her that idea was dead in the water. She then moved to trying to get herself, Tim and Ana out and in that route, she seamed to be making progress.<br />
“Forgive me, Lord but the love of my life is waiting for me and I need to be with her.” Said Chloe as Lord Sealine rubbed his chin. “Please, I am going to ask her to marry me this very night, let me go to her.”<br />
“You all have my sympathy.” expressed Lord Sealine “However we can’t be seen helping humans at the moment, a whole village that is hundreds of subjects where killed not a day ago when some humans dumped toxic chemicals on their village. I don’t believe they knew it was there, just some horrible accident but…”<br />
“Where was this?” inquired Chloe<br />
“Off the horn of Africa as you would call it.” Stated Lord Sealine as Chloe cursed a bit under her breath. <br />
“That is across the world and…” started Chloe as Lord Sealine raised his hand telling her to stop talking.<br />
“Humans are humans in the view of the public, there is no way I can convince the King to go ahead with this and if I do it without his permission my house will lose too much power…” started Lord Sealine<br />
“I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOUR FUCKING POWER I CARE ABOUT THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!” yelled Chloe as the other mermaids and the merman looked at her in shocked horror. To their amazement Lord Sealine chuckled a bit, he wasn’t used to someone standing up to him and found it fresh.<br />
“I understand and I admire the force you show however if my family loses power then it is possible that whole cruise ships may go under as pay back for what they did off the horn of Africa.” Stated Lord Sealine “That is hundreds possibly thousands of people and raises our chances of being discovered and causing a war between the sea and the land. I can’t let any of you go back to the human world…I am sorry.”<br />
“Well you can’t stop me! I WILL SWIM BACK TO SHORE AND TELL EVERYONE ABOUT MERMAIDS AND MERMAN.” Threatened Chloe as Lord Sealine chuckled.<br />
“You don’t think that the leaders of the human world don’t know about us already?” inquired Lord Sealine as Chloe’s eyes widened. “If you swam up, it would be declared someone pulling a prank and in a day or two it will be forgotten. In the you will be imprisoned at best or experimented on at worse, the humans keep trying to figure that out.”<br />
“No…no…no…I can’t lose her…I love her.” Cried Chloe as Lord Sealine lowered his head. <br />
“I am sorry, but there is nothing I can do, the best I can do is…” started Lord Sealine<br />
“Lord Sealine if I may.” Interrupted Cura “You can’t allow Chloe to go back to her lover to return to her human world…would you allow her to join her in our world?”<br />
Chloe just looked at Cura not sure to say thank you or to slap her. She wanted to be with Stacy on land, to live the life they had dreamed for each other, not be mermaids living under the sea. <br />
“I would allow that.” Confirmed Lord Sealine “Very well…I will let you Cura contact her lover and give her the chance to become a mermaid and extend the offer to the other humans, you said there was 4 others correct?”<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Cura<br />
“Each one of them may select up to 1 other human to join them, with luck I may be able to use this to convince the other families to only take a few fishing ships instead of a whole cruise ship.” Stated Lord Sealine as his image disappeared.<br />
“What the fuck.” Cursed Chloe as she looked at Cura. <br />
“It is the best way.” Said Cura “now follow me.”<br />
Chloe did what she was told as she followed Cura back to where her friends where, the crowd had dissipated a bit but there was still a large amount of merfolk gathered around.<br />
“So where did you disappear to?” inquired Tim<br />
“Well she spoke on your behalf to one of our high lords.” Explained Cura as Tim and Ana’s eyes widened a little with hope, Monica and Damon did not share their hope they knew it was unlikely.<br />
“Sadly they will not let us go back.” Said Chloe her voice haunted as tears began to form in her friends eyes. <br />
“Yes, political it can’t be done however Lord Sealine did give you a boon.” Stated Cura “I am allowed to travel back to the human beach and through magic transform 1 human each of your choice to join you with us.”<br />
“What…you want us to pick someone we know to be forced to become this?” inquired Ana as Cura looked insulted.<br />
“No…we would never force it on them…your case was an accident and we are trying to make it right. If the names you share with me wish to join you I will.” Explained Cura “But yes, each of you can pick 1 person to join you under the sea if they wish.”<br />
“Wait…how can you transform them into merpeople and how could you even find them?” inquired Monica<br />
“Well transforming them isn’t hard, we have a few magical orbs in stock that transforms people into merfolks, sadly  it is only one way.” Explained Cura “We have them incase we find a drowned person or the like. As to finding them.”<br />
Cura reached out and placed her hands on either side of Chloe’s head.<br />
“Please think about this Stacy.” Stated Cura as Chloe thought of her girlfriend. “Lovely women, that rich black hair and dark eyes is very beautiful.”<br />
“You can read our mind?” inquired Chloe as Cura lowered her hands. <br />
“Limited and only the way I showed you.” confirmed Cura as she looked at the others. “Do any of you have anyone you want me to summon to the beach to offer them this gift?”</p>
