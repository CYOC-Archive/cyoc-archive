<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris grinned as he looked at his new stats, and then he looked at his <br />
father's.  <br />
<br />
Name: Chris Sanderson<br />
Age: 16<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Height: 6'10''<br />
Weight 350lbs<br />
Build: Muscular, minimum fat<br />
IQ: 175<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexual Preference: Straight<br />
Sex Drive: Maximum<br />
Penis size: 12inches soft, 18 erect<br />
Occupation: Student<br />
-----<br />
<br />
He edited Mike's stats making him two inches taller and 75 lbs heavier <br />
and making him muscular and lean too.  Then he decided to knock his <br />
dad's IQ down a few points, and make him more of average intellect <br />
instead of a know it all.  He chuckled that was his new job,  he was <br />
the smartest, buffest, biggest cocked guy in the house. He looked <br />
around his room, and recalled his father's speech about as an &quot;office <br />
worker this is the best I can afford.&quot; <br />
<br />
He chuckled, &quot;Well, from now on pops, you're senior vice president and <br />
I expect my lifestyle to improve accordingly.&quot; The likelihood that his <br />
father could rise to senior executive status with an average IQ was <br />
ignored.  The Chronivac would take care of any discrepancies.<br />
<br />
He looked at it one more time, and grinned. His father was 38, he was <br />
16.  His father was always complaining that since he turned 35, he <br />
couldn't control his weight, and had started losing his hair. Chris <br />
grinned and took a few years off his father's age.  The Chronivac <br />
would iron over the new facts that resulted in Chris being born when <br />
he was father was 16, instead of 22. <br />
<br />
Just before he hit execute, Chris changed one more thing. Instead of <br />
&quot;Divorced&quot;, his father's marital status now read &quot;married.&quot;<br />
<br />
name: Mike Sanderson<br />
Age: 38<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Height: 6'5&quot;<br />
Weight 300 lbs<br />
Build: Buff<br />
IQ: 100<br />
Status: Married<br />
Sexual Preference: Bi<br />
Penis size: 7.5inches soft, 9 erect<br />
Occupation: Senior Vice President<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION COMMENCING.  The countdown clock appeared.<br />
<br />
Chris felt the char under him lurch, and roll backwards.  It had been <br />
an old kitchen chair from Goodwill. Now it was an honest to goodness <br />
ergonomic desk chair on casters. He watched as his futon became a four <br />
poster cherry wood bed.<br />
<br />
He swung his fist up in the air, and shouted, &quot;Yes! Score!&quot;<br />
<br />
The old PC monitor became a 24&quot; flatscreen and the PC became an Mac. <br />
Chris' clothing changed from no name jeans and a t-shirt to Polo <br />
Khakis and a Polo shirt. He stood up and admired himself and his room. <br />
He headed for the door to see the rest of the house.  He had retained <br />
his awareness of the changes, but had set his father to accept the new <br />
reality as if it had always been so.<br />
<br />
Chris was startled when he opened his bedroom door.  His curtains had <br />
been drawn shut and remained closed though their quality improved.  <br />
The hallway didn't open into his old house.  It was a new floor plan. <br />
A new house with a long corridor and open balcony overlooking the <br />
living room and dining room stretched before him.<br />
<br />
His dad was serving a pasta dinner to an older guy in the dining room.  <br />
He looked up at the railing where Chris stood, and shouted, &quot;There you <br />
are sleepy head. Finally, ready for dinner?  I must've called you <br />
three times.  Come on down and join your dads for dinner!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, dad!&quot; Chris answered and then paused, he said under his breath, <br />
&quot;Did he say dads?  He must've meant dad's dinner.  But he's married <br />
now, so shouldn't it be mom's dinner.  And who's that old dude - oh, <br />
wait I remember seeing his picture in dad's office newspaper. That's <br />
Mark Mortimer the CEO of dad's company. Makes sense a VP would have <br />
the CEO to dinner.&quot;  Chris muttered to himself as he ran downstairs. <br />
This house was great. <br />
<br />
There were only 3 places at the table, and his father and Mr. Mortimer <br />
were at two of them.  Chris sat down at the third.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mr. Mortimer,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
His father and Mr. Mortimer exchanged glances. And Mr. Mortimer said, <br />
&quot;Why so formal, Chris? You usually call me Mark, though I prefer Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; Chris asked uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call us both dad, Chris. Legally, Mark and I are married <br />
remember. You were my best man in Des Moines, Iowa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about mom?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Sandra's been out of the picture since you were two.  Mike was <br />
really too young when he knocked her up. They were both younger than <br />
you. I know you know the story, but sometimes it helps to put things <br />
in perspective. They divorced when they were 18, and you were two.  <br />
And it was my good fortune to run into this young handsome honest stud <br />
when I was just starting my company, and we've been together ever <br />
since. I helped raise you since you were three, Chris, that's why you <br />
went to bodybuilding camp, and are now the buffest kid your age in the <br />
country. My PowerStud Nutrition Products have made us all studs,&quot; Mark <br />
said flexing his biceps.  His loose clothing shifted to reveal that he <br />
too was a muscle hunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; said Chris absentmindedly.  His mind was racing.  He <br />
hadn't foreseen these complications.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, go ahead eat your pasta.  I made the noodles from scratch, and <br />
stuffed them with Powerstud Powder, cheese, spinach, and bison meat. <br />
It's just the way you like it, son!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, thanks, dad. And, dad,&quot; he added nodding toward Mark, &quot;I guess <br />
I'm still waking up. A lot of it seems like dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a bite of pasta, and smacked his lips. This was damn good. <br />
Maybe two dads wouldn't be so bad.  His mother had been out the <br />
picture for the last six years anyway.  She had remarried and had <br />
triplets, so she didn't have time for Chris anymore anyway.</p>
