<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex surveyed his body.  He was pudgy, not excessively tall, and his features weren't above the norm.  Everything about his 18 year old self was completely average... well, save for the 1/8th of an inch dick he sported from the last spell he tried.  He could change anything about himself using the book... but what would it be?  He thought of Ric turning into a fatass... which he kind of liked.  Then he thought of his Dad turning into a baby.  He was 18 now, making himself younger wasn't too appealing yet.  Making his dick younger wasn't fun either, since it dissappears.  He could make himself older too, but not yet.  He had decided what he wanted to change about himself.  He wanted to be a muscle freak.<br />
<br />
  He flipped open the book and began to rifle through the spells to cast on his body, coming up with fattening spells, gender switches, animal transformations.  After 15 minutes of searching he found it.  A muscle growth spell that would make him grow larger by the second.<br />
<br />
&quot;If growing larger is for you,<br />
but getting fatter just won't do.<br />
Read this spell for muscle abound,<br />
solid muscles grow pound on pound.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Alex waited, feeling the slight tingle throughout his body.  He didn't see any changes happening though.it took about 20 seconds before he finally saw a change in his pecs and arms... he was gaining a pound per second, like Ric did when he got fatter.  Now 215 pounds, Alex wanted to get big even quicker.  He looked down the page and found a spell he could use to speed up the growing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muscle grown, you've had a taste,<br />
but now you'd like to grow in haste.<br />
if 1 pound adding is not enough<br />
chant this chant to speed it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
  Alex felt the tingling intensify, and he watched as his pecs heaved out before his eyes, he felt his shoulders twitch and saw as they rounded out.  He felt his trap muscles swell slightly, and his neck expand.  He saw his thighs grow and begin to segment...  He even saw a line appear on his somewhat pudgy stomach.  That was a big spurt!  He guessed he had gained 15 or 20 pounds in that one.  A few seconds passed, and he began to swell again.  His arms puffed up at his sides, and his lats forced them slightly upward.  His thighs expanded, now touching each other.  He stood up and ran to the bathroom to see what he looked like.<br />
<br />
  As he walked into the bathroom, he saw the reflection of his new self.  Square jawed, bulky, striated.  Whatever pudginess was on him before had been spread thinly across his new muscle bod.  He felt another wave of growth hit him, and watched in the mirror as his pecs tightened under his skin.  He felt his ass get a little higher as well.  Looking himself over, he noticed he had abs.   He wandered over to the scale, trying to look over his pecs to see that he was 285 pounds.  The scale groaned a moment as he began to grow larger again. His pecs heaved out, and he felt his nipples beginning to goe under the crease of his pecs.  He could fit his fingers almost up to the knuckles in the crease between the two pecs now.  He checked out his midsection.  It wasn't bowing out like most bodybuilders... probably because he didn't take roids.  He turned around and felt his ass brush up against the sink.  He chuckled and sauntered out of the room.  He was big enough now, so he was going to go stop the spell.<br />
<br />
  He sat on the couch and began to look through the book for a spell to stop the growing.  Now 325 pounds, he was exceeding the weight of most professional bodybuilders.  He grew as he turned pagesm unable to find the stopping spell.... it was nowhere to be found.  345 pounds... his pecs were starting to block the view of the book.  He was just going to keep getting more muscular!  He needed some help.  He reached for the phone and began to dial.  His finger cracked the face plate as he pressed in numbers, since he wasn't used to his new strength.  The phone rang a few times and a young man answered.  &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Alex piped up &quot;Josh?  Is that you?&quot;.  Josh replied with a yes.  &quot;It's me, Alex.  I need you to come over... something is happening to me.  I keep getting more and more muscular, and it's starting to get hard to move.&quot;  Josh made an annoyed noise.  &quot;So you took the book, alex?  Serves you right.  Find the answer for yourself.&quot;  Alex began to panic, not wanting Josh to hang up, he chanted the muscle growth spells into the phone.  Hoping to cast his spell on Josh.  On the other side of the phone, he heard Josh make a gasp of surprise.  It must've worked.  &quot;There!  Now you need the spell to stop the growth too, so get over here and help me find it before we both get too big to move!&quot;  Josh hung up.<br />
<br />
  Alex lay there on his couch, watching his body expand again.  385....  He stood while he was still able to.  Looking down as best he could, he saw that his pecs were blocking the view of his feet... and his dick.  He just remembered that he had made it small!  He had to fix that before Josh came over.  Picking up the book, he looked up the spell, again, he swelled to 405 pounds.  He found the one he needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Growing, snaking, inching up,<br />
you will need a bigger cup.<br />
Bigger, longer, like a rock.<br />
Give yourself a massive cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Alex felt the changes instantly.  His 1/8th of an inch dick began to swell again.  He wondered how massive massive was, since he couldn't see how big it was getting.  He shifted his weight to one side and felt the shaft hit his knee....  so it was pretty big.  He grew again, and prayed that Josh would show up soon.  The 425 pound teen was in a bit of a pickle.  Soon, he felt his cock touch the floor.  It was still growing too....<br />
<br />
  It took a few minutes, but Alex heard josh enter the house and run down the stairs.  He hit the landing and saw Alex there, 500 pounds of him, growing.  He also noticed a 2 and a half foot dick, sprouting from him.  Josh had swelled up to 240 before getting here, but he dreaded getting too big to move like Alex.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Hi Josh.&quot; Said Alex over his mountainous pecs.  Josh nodded at his growing friend, who began to swell again before him.  Josh's face was now obscured by his pecs.  Josh sat in front of the book and began to search.  Minutes passed, and Josh continued to beef up, Alex growing slightly faster behind him.  Josh was soon exceeding 300 pounds, his pants were ripping as he passed spell after spell.  Alex's body made a groaning noise as he breathed, since his muscles were so tight.  He was nearing 700 pounds.  Eventually, Josh found it.  He had hit 350 pounds, Alex was up to 745.<br />
<br />
  He began a chant, but would it work?</p>
