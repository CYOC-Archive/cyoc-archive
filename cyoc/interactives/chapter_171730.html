<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    Vern used his answering machine to make sure he didn&#39;t miss any calls from other breeders or his clients. He also used it to screen calls from the doctors that he suddenly stopped talking to. Vern has settled into a regime of spending the day in the kennels, and letting Jake be his alpha male at night. Vern tried to go without submitting his pussy to Jake, but could not even go two days between knot sessions. Vern continued to slowly erase the years with each orgasm. At night, alone with his thoughts, Vern believes this is some sort of deal with the devil just to be able to urinate without pain. The canine dildo was weeks ago stored, not to be touched again.<br />
<br />
    Vern was out in the field by the kennel with a few pups, when a BMW G wagon pulled up his driveway. Vern recognized the rather distinctive vehicle, it belonged to Dr. Alexander Johnson, Dr. AJ to his patients. Vern had the pups follow him back to the kennel, then went to greet Dr. AJ alone.<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ smiled and waved, &quot;Vern, it&#39;s been a while. I come to check on you. You&#39;ve not called back in three months.&quot; As Vern walked closer, AJ noticed it wasn&#39;t. &quot;Sorry, are you the new owner here? I&#39;m Dr. Johnson, I was a physician to the previous owner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern stops a few feet from AJ, &quot;What are you talking about Al. It&#39;s still me, I just have hair and I have no need for any doctors.&quot; Vern never called him by his name, just &quot;Al&quot;, because no amount of doctors could save his wife. They didn&#39;t deserve titles until they could provide results.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your as salty as Vern. The man I know as Vern is 75. Forgive me, but you don&#39;t look anywhere close to that,&quot; challenged Dr. Johnson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I&#39;m not Vern. Vern is dead, please go,&quot; Vern said sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to Vern?&quot; asked Dr. Johnson.<br />
<br />
Vern became visibly angry, &quot;Good day doctor. I don&#39;t have time for your nonsense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ&#39;s face became filled with bewilderment, as he realized it was Vern he was talking to, but looked nothing like the man he was preparing to give a death sentence too three months earlier. &quot;How is this possible, how can you be Vern?&quot; asks Dr. Johnson to Vern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since your not going to leave, what can I get you to drink?&quot; offered Vern, as he waved his arm for Dr. AJ to walk toward the house.<br />
<br />
Sitting at the table, Vern asked Dr. AJ a straight question, &quot;Did you come up here to find me dead or sick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ replied, &quot;Yes. That blond nurse you flirt with was asking about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern was dismissive, &quot;When you return, tell her thank you for the advise on the prostate massage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it still hurt?&quot; asks Dr. AJ.<br />
<br />
Vern sighs and says with contempt, &quot;Not for a while. No thanks to you and your biopsy friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ could not explain it, but the man in front of him was Vern, a 75 year old terminal prostate cancer patient. Dr. AJ took a breath and delivered the news he came for, &quot;The cancer in your prostate is terminal. It&#39;s probably already spread. 6 months, tops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern smiles, &quot;Hah. Your words mean nothing Al. How long did you say my wife had? She is gone, yet you are at my table, drinking coffee in a cup she picked out. You give me words. You can&#39;t give me what I want. Why must you torment me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ shakes his head,  and sighs, &quot;I am here to tell you want the results you never came back for. She asked me to look after you if she didn&#39;t make it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern slams his fist on the table angrily, &quot;Then you have done your duty Al, and now you can go.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Dr. AJ stands, and slowly places the coffee cup on the table. The good doctor had so many questions, but he was sure that the person he as talking to was Vern, but at the same time could not believe it. Dr. AJ paused a moment, and said, &quot;Thank you for the coffee Vern. I&#39;ll let myself out,&quot; then turned and left out the door.<br />
<br />
Vern was still sitting at the table, sobbing softly as the G wagon&#39;s engine started and the doctor drove way. Vern didn&#39;t hate the doctor, but he didn&#39;t trust Al or his other doctor friends since they left one of the two cancers his wife had diagnosed until it was too late. Vern went to wash his face in his bathroom, and stared into the mirror of the barely forty year old man looking back at him.<br />
<br />
The day of Dr. AJ&#39;s vist was forgotten into the past. Winter had come and gone, and was approaching again. Fall was a good time for the retriever business due to the waterfowl seasons in various places. The last of this years training dogs were just picked up and the very happy owner was in awe of how well they did the demonstration drills. The kennel was looking bare. Vern had four males and a non-breeding female. They were all past champions of several retriever competitions. A small SUV was driving up while Vern was busy in the kennel, causing him to pause and go attend to the unexpected visitor.<br />
<br />
The bald man who got out of the SUV was coughing. The driver saw Vern and asked, &quot;Hi young man, I am looking for the owner of this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern puts his palm to his forehead, &quot;And who can I say is looking for him?&quot;<br />
<br />
The rather sickly man replies, &quot;Dr. Johnson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern did his own double take, how long had it been? This person looked nothing like the good doctor, but a feeble man who&#39;s body had been ravaged by neglect. Vern looked angry, &quot;Was I not clear enough last time, I have no need for doctors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vern?&quot; asked Dr. AJ, &quot;Is that you?&quot; Dr. AJ stumbled and fell as he tried to walk toward Vern.<br />
<br />
Vern went over and picked up the doctor, and helped him inside to the same table he sat at last time. &quot;Would you like coffee?&quot; asked Vern.<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ just coughed for several minutes.  Dr. AJ&#39;s vision was slightly blurry on a good day, but the had a hard time believing this teenager was Vern. Dr. AJ took a moment to compose himself, &quot;How? You should be long dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ask your oncologist friend. He has no answers, just maybe&#39;s and a lot of hope,&quot; responded a displeased Vern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m dying Vern. It&#39;s all over my body, and chemo was killing me. Please, share with me what you did?&quot; begged a desperate Dr. AJ.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of my house and never return to my property. You pedal hope to others, yet you cannot save yourself,&quot; answered a bitter Vern.<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson pleaded, &quot;Please Vern, I don&#39;t want to die. You should be almost seventy six, but here you are, your so young.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern shakes his head, &quot;I cannot help you Al. I have no cure, no treatment, no miracle. I only swapped one curse for another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson begged, &quot;Please Vern, I am at your mercy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern buried his face in his hands, &quot;You don&#39;t understand, hell, I don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s not what you think, it is not a cure. Your not going to believe me. Alright...I&#39;ll hand you a dildo, and you need to turn it on and stick it in your ass. Are you that desperate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson offered, &quot;I&#39;ll give you a blow job if that is what it takes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern grumbled loudly, &quot;Don&#39;t make me regret this. Go take off your clothes and get into the shower.&quot; Vern left to get the dildo that he had left alone for so long, and putting in a battery. &quot;Damn Al. You look like shit,&quot; said Vern looking at the frail doctor in his shower. Vern got a tube of lubricate from under the bathroom sink, and then gave the lubed canine dildo to Dr. AJ. &quot;Shove this in your ass and turn it on, the rest will follow,&quot; Vern commanded. &quot;I am going to regret this,&quot; Vern thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson took the dildo, and did as instructed, turning on the dildo before it disappeared into his ass, &quot;I&#39;ll pass your little disgusting test.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern went back outside to the kennels while the good doctor got acquainted with the canine dildo. A couple of hours later, Vern returned to check on Al, whom he expected to find asleep in the shower, and that is how Vern found Al, asleep in the bottom of his shower stall. Vern carried him to his bed, and covered him with a light blanket. Vern slept in his recliner at the back of the bedroom. Vern was awake when Al opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vern?&quot; asked Dr. Johnson.<br />
<br />
Vern stood up and walked over to Dr. Johnson, &quot;There&#39;s two more of those ahead. You got through the first one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson tried to move, &quot;I can&#39;t move, I need the toilet. Can you move me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern was able to easily lift the man who may have been a hundred pounds wet. Vern leaned forward to let Dr. AJ sit down on the toilet. Vern then went back to the bed, and sure enough the dildo was there. Vern groaned and was disgusted, but picked up the dildo and returned to the bathroom to clean it in the sink before replacing the battery.<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson looked over to Vern, &quot;Ok, you S.o.B. how did you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern huffed, and held up the dildo, now clean. &quot;This. two more times and you&#39;ll believe me. Are you ready for round two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson was barely able to move from the toilet to the shower, but he made it. Vern handed him the dildo, and left. Vern returned an hour later from his morning kennel duty and found Dr. AJ still awake, but limp and having an occasional jolt of his body in orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;The second one last longer because that fullness you feel is the expanded knot of the dildo. Just leave the dildo in the sink when it comes out,&quot; asks Vern. Vern leaves for his morning business of getting the kennel insulated and ready for winter. Lunch time finds Vern back in the house, with Dr. AJ asleep on his bed, and the dildo in the bathroom sink. Vern cleans the dildo again, and makes sure the battery still has charge. Vern left the sleeping doctor and had lunch, before returning to the kennel. Vern returned to the house well after dark. The doctor was sitting at the kitchen table, drinking coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;One more, and you have to promise to show me your secret,&quot; demanded Dr. Johnson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; offers Vern.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Vern offers the dildo to Dr. AJ. &quot;Last time. Stick this in, turn it on, and get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Last time,&quot; repeats a very annoyed Dr. Johnson, and then inserts the dildo before turning it on. It&#39;s not long before the knot pops and Al erupts in his own orgasm sitting in Vern&#39;s shower chair. Vern taps on Dr. AJ&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Clean up and let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern and Dr. AJ spend the day working in the kennel. The throbbing in the Doctor&#39;s ass is distracting and tiring. At lunch, Dr. AJ asks Vern why the dildo is still swollen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will shrink,&quot; offers Vern. It would take until the next morning when Dr. AJ woke up that he was free of the dildo. Vern noticed that Dr. AJ&#39;s cock was now dark red and tapered. Vern took the dildo when Dr. AJ got out of the bed and into the shower stall. Vern had cleaned up and removed the battery from the dildo, returning it to its storage place. Vern waited at the kitchen table for  Dr. AJ to enter the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ entered the kitchen with a towel wrapped around his waist. He unwrapped the towel and showed Vern the canine sheath he now had and said, &quot;Ummm. We need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern, sitting at the table naked, stood up in silence and stepped around to show the doctor his.<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ was now more puzzled than before. &quot;I don&#39;t believe it, I cannot explain it, is this real, or am I dead or dreaming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern sighed deeply, &quot;The changes have started. You see that. Your sheath will shrink and feminize unless you take an actual canine cock inside you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor&#39;s eyes went wide, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern pointed to his canine vagina, &quot;I struggled and wasted time, and I lost my manhood. Just go into the kennel and get on your hands and knees. One of them will mount you. The longer you wait Al, the more you&#39;ll be like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. AJ didn&#39;t want a pussy, and seeing one on Vern was concerning, he didn&#39;t wast time in getting to the kennel, and getting on his hands and knees. Vern was just walking out when the doctor let out a scream, so it was the first thrust or first swelling. Vern didn&#39;t care to watch, and worked moving the doctor&#39;s SUV to the side of the house.<br />
<br />
Dr. Johnson was leaving the kennel when Vern walked up, both naked and both examining the other. They walked back to the kitchen table in silence. They sat for several minutes before Dr. AJ asks, &quot;I&#39;m hungry. I have not wanted to eat in weeks because of the chemotherapy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Vern states, &quot;I didn&#39;t think you would do it Al. At least you could have struggled against the idea of getting mounted to freeze the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor says in disbelief, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe your Vern. You could be in high school. You should be dead. I should be in the agony of not being able to eat. I can walk around and not get dizzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All true,&quot; replies Vern flatly, &quot;...and you still have your manhood. The orgasms...the more you have the younger you get. This is as young as I can get, so this is the stopping point. That&#39;s as far as I care to go with this, as I don&#39;t trust it. No hurry on making any choices here. You need time to let this sink in.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The two men chatted for the next hour before Vern&#39;s eyes saw the kitchen clock, and excused himself to go back and work in the kennel. The doctor got dressed in and came back out to the kennel.</p>
