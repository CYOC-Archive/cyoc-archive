<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In another part of Moon Lake, a lone and heavy sigh echoed through a quiet living room as only the sound of the television interrupted the silence of the room. It wasn&#39;t that great a program but it was reasonably enjoyable, and was enough that Lila was able to avoid thinking too much about Theodore and Marcy Green. She&#39;d grown up in Moon Lake, majored in mathematics and bookkeeping, and had happily served Moon Lake&#39;s city government by keeping the books balanced as it were. This related to the various things like city level taxes and fines, money that came in from Washington State as part of the state taxes and soon balanced against what was spent by the city government. Normally it gave Lila Carpenter the challenge of making sure that the city wasn&#39;t spending more than it earned, but of late, she&#39;d found herself with other desires.<br />
<br />
This went beyond basic sex. If it was just that, Lila was privately fairly certain she could find that, as there were often plenty of single weres that would be all too eager for some fun. And that fun could be quite enjoyable, but after receiving a request from Samantha Twist regarding a human male from outside Moon Lake that wanted to be a were, Lila had found herself with new thoughts and feelings. They were desires that she really hadn&#39;t experienced. She marveled at the powerful white tiger form that Theodore Green took on when he became a were and she adored how close he was to his wife, Marci. They were a lovely couple, and one that Lila had really only seen before with her brother and his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they were quite willing to have me with them,&quot; Lila thought to herself, thinking back on some of her conversations with Theodore and Marci Green, &quot;a handsome man and a beautiful woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
That left her sighing heavily as her thoughts drifted over to the two of them again. Shortly before they had left Moon Lake to return to their home on the East Coast, Lila had caught them strolling around Moon Lake as she left her job at Moon Lake&#39;s city hall for the night. There she made the offer for a future long lasting relationship. Moon Lake didn&#39;t support outright polygamy in the way it was argued for in some circles, but the concept of open marriages and being open about it was actually fairly common in Moon Lake, especially with werecats and werewildcats, as the member of the marriage that was bisexual would often would arrange for an open marriage so that the bisexual partner could enjoy both sexes and desires.<br />
<br />
And that was the sort of deal that Lila had offered to Theodore and Marci, as she liked both of them, and learning that Marci was a werecat, it would be obvious that Marci would have desires for that too. Both of them accepted Lila&#39;s offer and she was quite happy at that. It would let her form a firm bond the man she had turned and the woman that she had turned her husband for. Lila happily smiled that thought, especially as she also felt that Marci was also quite fetching. Thus their accepting her offer gave her hope for something on par with what her brother had with his wife, and that was a nice dream to look forward to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... I still have wait,&quot; Lila sighed to herself, knowing that while the Greens had promised to return, unless Theodore Green was transferred to the FBI&#39;s Seattle Field Office, it was likely that they&#39;d have to remain in the Washington DC area until they had to retire on the basis of covering that they were weres. That would mean that they&#39;d be on the East Coast for at least five years, and that assumed that Theodore Green wasn&#39;t promoted up the FBI&#39;s chain of command.<br />
<br />
Lila&#39;s eyes drifted over to an end table by her couch. Sitting there was a small silver picture frame. In the frame was a picture Lila with her brother and his wife. It was a good picture and served to remind Lila of her brother waiting for the woman that captured his heart. Lila knew that her brother had longed for someone to be with forever, but had never run into someone that fit that role, not even in Moon Lake. Because of this, while most weres went to Moon Lake College, as it would let them remain in the &quot;open&quot; in the Moon Lake area, her brother didn&#39;t. He ultimately went to Boise State in Idaho where he met the woman who would one day become his wife. He liked her and they dated off and on for years, though her brother ended up getting nervous on commitment because she was a normal. There were also some element hesitancy on Lila&#39;s sister-in-law&#39;s part as well, over concerns that her parents had regarding Lila&#39;s brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;But then... brother,&quot; Lila thought to herself as she reached out to the picture frame and ran her fingers down the smooth glass surface that protected the picture, &quot;You waited for her... and with a great deal of faithfulness. I suppose I can wait for Teddy and Marci too.&quot;<br />
<br />
And her brother did wait, and after a few years of pulling various odd jobs and engineering work in Idaho, he&#39;d convinced his girlfriend&#39;s father that he was &quot;worthy.&quot; He then brought the girlfriend to Moon Lake to introduce her to his and Lila&#39;s parents, and of course to Lila. Dinner had gone well and included the reveal that the Carpenter family were weretigers, though it seemed that that was received quite happily as Lila and her parents soon heard two pleasure filled roars come from the guest bedroom, showing the happy response her brother had gotten and the virtue of paying off. Her brother and his girlfriend would marry and settled into a home elsewhere in Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may not be the same as happy monogamy,&quot; Lila thought, as though she were actually talking to her brother, &quot;and Teddy is someone that many in Moon Lake might be hesitant about talking to... as he is a FBI agent...  but he&#39;s still a good man. He&#39;s strong and loving. And from what they&#39;ve told me, he&#39;s protected Marci&#39;s secret for years. She&#39;s a wonderful all white werecat... based off the Turkish Angora, I think... and with Teddy becoming a white weretiger, they&#39;d both be worthy of love and attention. I&#39;m sure you&#39;d like both of them.&quot;</p>
