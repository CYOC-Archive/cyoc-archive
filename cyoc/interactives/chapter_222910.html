<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I...live on the outskirts of Entus, a small village on the south-east side of the forest&quot;  I said, finally deciding.  Without a word, the man reached behind him, and only then I noticed that the large steed had approached.  The man stood, turning the horse to a side, then reached down to pick me up and hoist me into the saddle.  Having not been carried in such a way since I was a child, I could not help but feel a bit awkward, but given my situation, I brushed it aside and tried to settle myself, not being familiar with riding side-saddle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Sir...&quot;  I trailed off, obviously fishing for a name.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am known as Avar,&quot;  the man responded to my cue as he retrieved his spear, lifted the large boar easily, and slung it across the horse&#39;s haunches behind me.  The sheer size of the boar became apparent due to proximity, and I did no know whether to be more astounded that the horse could easily carry it or that the man had so easily hefted it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir Avar, you have my gratitude,&quot;  I bowed my head, trying to appear humble.  &quot;I am called Pershe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no need for honorifics,&quot;  Avar replied, giving me an inscrutable glance before he mounted the horse between me and the boar, much to my surprise.  It was not that I wanted Avar to walk, but the amount of strength the horse must have had to carry the boar, let alone me and Avar, was beyond my understanding.  Furthermore, my position meant I was effectively cradled in his arms as he grasped the reins.  Before I could voice any protest, the mount took off at breakneck speed through the trees, and it was all I could do to not gasp in surprise.<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
I could see a small figure with a lantern outside the entrance to the cabin.  The sun had set, and naturally, Rehid was anxious.  His head turned at the unfamiliar sound of heavy hoofbeats, and his eyes widened with surprise at our approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister!&quot;  Rehid called as he approached, eyeing Avar warily.  &quot;Are you alright?  What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avar dismounted and helped me down, removed the boar from the horse, then, while carrying it, looked to me as though for instructions.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Rehid, I am okay, I just sprained my ankle,&quot;  I said softly while leaning on the boy&#39;s shoulder.  I was not sure what Avar was doing, but I couldn&#39;t just let him leave.  &quot;Avar, please come inside.  It is late, and the least we can do for your kindness is to offer you a meal.&quot;  Rehid was confused at first, but being quick on the uptake, he soon nodded graciously at Avar.  Avar, after a moment, also nodded, but still stood still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where should I place the boar?&quot;  Avar finally asked, only for me to be confused this time.  My look must have said it all, because he continued.  &quot;Your injury was my fault, please accept the boar as recompense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You needn&#39;t--&quot;  I tried to refuse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot;  Avar repeated, and his intensely golden eyes once again seemed like they were glowing in the dark.  Finally, I nodded, dumbly, and Rehid hurried to show Avar to the shed, as I leaned on the doorframe.  As they returned, I turned to enter the cabin, but before I could hop to a stool, I found myself carried princess-style over the threshold and placed gently on a chair.  I did not even have a chance to register what happened before Avar turned to Rehid, who was carrying a section of meat Avar had removed from the boar carcass.  As though by tacit agreement, the boy and man turned to the small kitchen area to ready the meal while I looked on in wonder.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
&quot;Avar!&quot;  Rehid called out happily, waving from the cabin entrance.  I hobbled over on my crutch and could not help but raise an eyebrow.  For the past two weeks, as I recuperated, Avar had visited every day.  No, not simply visited, he had almost become a fixture of our little home.  Each time, he not only brought fresh game he had hunted, he skinned it, cleaned it, and cooked fine meals for the three of us.  I was becoming a bit embarrassed by my own meager skills, but not only that, I was also becoming slightly curious about Avar&#39;s constant presence.  How did he manage to hunt, travel to our middle-of-nowhere village, cook and clean, then return to his own home every day?  His appearance was immaculate, and it did not seem he was camping in the woods.  But where on earth could he have come from?<br />
<br />
Rehid had become quite fond of him, and even I could not help but settle comfortably into our routine.  After dinner that evening, Avar unwrapped my ankle, then supported me to my feet.  I gingerly put my foot down, and it seemed I was finally mended.  I could not help but feel a little sad;  now that I was well, there was no reason for Avar to come by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Avar, for all your help,&quot;  I finally steeled myself to look up into his golden eyes and bid him farewell.  &quot;I seem to be healed, so you needn&#39;t push yourself to---&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;It <i>was</i> you!!&quot;  the door flew open with a thud, and a familiar voice screeched out from the darkness.  Before I could make sense of what the Viengre woman was doing barging into my house, something unbelievable happened.  White light poured out from behind her and coalesced into...feathery wings?  What on earth--  <br />
<br />
&quot;Demon!!  I should have known you would seek to corrupt those parentless urchins!  I shall expel the lot of you!&quot; the yowling continued.<br />
<br />
Avar pushed Rehid and I behind him, and a roaring sound blasted around us.  When I opened my eyes, crouching behind Avar and clutching Rehid to me, I realized in shock that nothing was left of our cabin but a few shards of debris here and there.  Only the spot where we quivered behind Avar was untouched.  Flabbergasted, I looked over my shoulder at Avar.<br />
<br />
With his back turned to me, I could only see his outline.  However, there was one thing that was indisputable.  Rising out of Avar&#39;s temples were a pair of long, sharp, black horns.</p>
