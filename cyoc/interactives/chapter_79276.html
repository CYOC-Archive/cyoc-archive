<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Thanks for drinking the juice. Sharing a stomach does have its perks." Kyle said as he leaned forward with Kevin so they could set the 
empty glass down on the table. </p>

<p>"Yeah maybe for you. That juice that Josh and I had pored you has a nasty flavor." Kevin relied as he and Kyle shifted their body around till 
they were sitting comfortably again. </p>

<p>"Now you know why I didn't want to drink it." Kyle smiled.</p>

<p>The joined teens sat in a comfortable silence for a few moments. Both were contemplating on what they should do since they would have 
to be spending the rest of the day side by side. </p>

<p>"So...." Kyle stated, not sure of what to say. </p>

<p>Kevin smiled, "So... we could play Xbox, watch a movie, play a card game?" Kyle shook his head to every offer that Kevin presented.</p>

<p>"Dude, I have been stuck inside and in the hospital today so far. Lets do something outside, for a little change of scenery." Kyle replied. 
</p>

<p>"Right... do something outside. I'm sure that no one would ever notice the two of us nonchalantly walking down the street.</p>

<p>Kyle ignored his comment. "Come on, we could go for a run. I need to start exercising again anyways. Ever since I found the eagle chains, I 
haven't been able to go jogging. Besides, its kind of cool outside. We could wear my sweatshirt and flip the hood over our heads until we get to 
the hiking trails. No one has used those besides me so we can jog the trails without fearing anyone seeing us." </p>

<p>"Kyle, your dad said that you need to be taking it easy." Kevin reminded him, but Kyle gave him his best puppy-dog eyes. "You look 
ridiculous doing that Kyle. But fine. I guess as slow jog wouldn't be bad, but then we have to come back right back here."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Now lets get ready!" Kyle excitedly said. He was very eager to get out of the house for awhile. The two of them quickly 
stood and walked upstairs to change into Kyle's running shoes. Thankfully, Kevin's foot, their right foot, fit into Kyle's running shoe. </p>

<p>Grabbing one of his sweatshirts from the closet, Kyle and Kevin forced both of their heads out of the small head whole, squishing their 
faces together. The sides of their faces were pressed even closer together when they slipped the single hood over their heads. While looking at 
themselves in the mirror, Kevin stated, "Dude, we're sharing a body, and this is too close for comfort. Besides, look at us. This isn't going to 
hide anything."</p>

<p>"This will hide us fine. As long as no one sees us from our front, they'll just think we're some guy taking a run. Now, lets go!" Kyle turned 
them around, and started for the front door.</p>

<p>They stumbled a few times on the walk over to the hiking trails, but the few people that notice them did not scream in terror or gawk at 
them. The hoodie must have been doing its job. And not a moment too soon, Kevin and Kyle yanked themselves out of the sweatshirt once they 
had become hidden behind the trees of the woods. </p>

<p>"Finally!" Kevin declared. "I thought our faces were going to merge together if we stayed like that any longer." He rubbed the side of his 
face that had been shushed into Kyle's. It was still red and sweaty, but the chill in the air was fixing that. </p>

<p>Kyle was doing the same with the right side of his face. "Yeah, tell me about it." The sweatshirt they had been wearing had fallen into the 
dirt. "Okay..." Kyle bent forward with Kevin to pick up his sweatshirt, and together, they tied it around their shared waist. "Ready?" Kyle asked, 
to which Kevin nodded. "Then lets go." With that, they started off down the trail in an easy jog. The ground was uneven so they both wanted to 
take it slow at first as to not risk landing faces first into the dirt.</p>

<p>After a few minutes down the trail, they settled into a nice rhythm and were able to pick up their pace. They continued at that pace until 
the continued thumping of the fused eagle chains against their chest grew significantly more annoying. Kevin forced them to a stop so he take 
them off and put there somewhere else that was safe.</p>

<p>However at that moment, both teens became aware of the sound of engines. They turned their heads and body around trying to locate and 
identify what the sound was, and then Kevin spotted them. It was four ATVs driving down the trail, coming closer. "Shit!" Kyle cursed. "I didn't 
think anyone would be on the trail."</p>

<p>There was no time for them to slip on their hooddie again. So instead, both Kyle and Kevin looked for a place they could hide. In their 
panic, they had become very uncoordinated. Both were yelling, "This way!" or "Over there!" and trying to pull their other half to the hiding spot 
they had found. Finally though, Kevin gave in. They had already fallen to the ground, so they dragged their mutual body to Kyle's hiding spot in 
the bushes. Soon after they were hidden, the ATVs came rushing down the trail. </p>

<p>One flew by, then two more. And, then a familiar sparkle from the trail caught Kevin's eye. In his panic, he had dropped the chains on the 
rocky trail. Before he could even react, the forth ATV drove in front of them, and smashed the two-headed eagle under its weight. </p></p>
