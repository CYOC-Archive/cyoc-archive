<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Jeff” takes out his phone and opens the App and starts to type, “wait,” Juan says, “Jeff” stops and looks at Juan with a raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“What’s up,” he asks, “having second thoughts? Why are you blushing?”<br />
<br />
“I… it just came to me,” Juan mumbles, “sh-shouldn’t we take our clothes off? I mean… um… I don’t want to… um… destroy them!”<br />
<br />
Now “Jeff” himself blushes, ‘these human emotions and feelings are so weird,’ the former object thinks to itself, “I… I guess we should,” he says, “for one… animals, even anthros, don’t need clothes and for two: it’s not like we have anything the other hasn’t got!”<br />
<br />
So the two teens strip, their face redder than a tomato as both of their cocks instantly erect, “um… le-let’s get these transformations set up,” Juan says, ‘Jeff sure has a great body,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah…,” “Jeff” replies and starts typing.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” first opens the “Anthro” option and selects “Dragon” for Juan and “Fox” for himself, “wh-what color do you want your scales to be,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I’d like my main scales to be black, with the scales on my torso and underside of my tail to be white. I’d also like to have blue eyes and my pupils should be slitted… as… as for genitals… um… I… I’d like to have a s-slit and my c-cock should be sh-shaped like a c-canine’s!”<br />
<br />
“Jeff”, who is just as red as Juan, nods and edits the transformation and saves it before moving to his own. Unaware to him, in his embarrassment, he failed to notice that the “personality” and “ability” fields in Juan’s settings are turned to “natural” which means that Juan will receive the personality of a dragon, which will cause the 15-year-old to become extremely dominant and since the abilities setting is also set to “Dragon” will cause Juan to have powerful hypnotic and powerful transformation magic.<br />
<br />
When “Jeff” finishes with his transformation settings he confirms them, unaware that he has made some mistakes with his own settings: instead of 16 his age now shows 12, his personality will become submissive and shy.<br />
<br />
After confirming the transformations, “Jeff” is asked if he’d like to activate the reality alteration, which he does, this causes everyone, except “Jeff” and Juan, to think they had always been anthros. He also is asked if the transformations should be painless, which he too accepts, unaware that the transformations, depending what part of their body, will feel pleasurable.<br />
<br />
The two teens shiver when the tingling runs through their bodies, “I… I’ll never get used to that,” Juan says.<br />
<br />
“Me neither,” “Jeff” replies, “is it just me, or are you suddenly a little taler than before? Or am I… shrinking? Because… everything seems to look bigger than before!”<br />
<br />
“Y-you look even younger than before,” Juan says, “have… have you made some mistakes when editing?”<br />
<br />
“Jeff” shakes his head, “no! I mean… I shouldn’t have,” he says.<br />
<br />
Juan simply shrugs, “then there should be nothing to worry about,” he says, he then grins, “you know… you are starting to look really cute,” he says, unaware that his personality has begun to change.<br />
<br />
“Jeff’s” personality too seems to change as the shrinking and de-aging teen blushes and starts to look a little shy, “th-thanks…,” he mumbles, his voice already sounding much softer and higher than before.<br />
<br />
Juan watches as “Jeff” continues to get younger, the “boy’s” body, while keeping its athletic appearance, seems to take on a more feminine appearance: “Jeff’s” butt seems to firm and become a little bigger and rounder, causing his hips to appear wider and his waist slimmer.<br />
<br />
‘Jeff’s body is starting to look more like a girl’s,’ Juan thinks to himself, his grin widens as he licks his lips, ‘it actually is turning me on! Looking at him makes me want to mate him so badly, but I am not gay! Hm… hehe… I have an idea,’ without thinking, Juan points a finger at “Jeff”, without the now 12-year-old noticing, and feels some kind of energy shoot from the tip of his finger. Juan watches as blue string of energy hits “Jeff” in the tummy, the “boy” not seeming to notice.<br />
<br />
“Man… being 12 again sucks,” the “boy” says, “all of my muscles I have worked for so hard are all gone”. The former surfboard has totally forgotten what he used to be, this is caused by the memories of the real Jeff, who at this moment is leaning against the cold concrete wall of some teens garage, still a surfboard. “Jeff” doesn’t notice the energy entering his body, as the energy completely absorbed, the “boy’s” tummy growls and “Jeff” lies a hand on it, “hu? Weird,” he says-<br />
<br />
What “Jeff” is unaware of, the growling is caused by a womb and ovaries forming while between his tiny balls and butt hole a virgin pussy is forming.<br />
<br />
Juan smirks to himself, ‘much better! Now I can impregnate him,’ he thinks to himself. By now Juan’s scales have developed and a long prehensile tail is swishing behind him as his hair falls out and his face pushes out into a muzzle. Two white horns grow from his scalp as large black wings grow from his back. Juan’s teeth fall out as they get replaced by sharp and pointy ones, his ears become pointy and a little bigger. His cock, which has become canine-like twitches as it throbs with arousal, his balls have retreated back into his body as a slit forms at the base of his new and improved cock, ‘I can’t wait to ram my cock into his tight pussy,’ the Dragon-boy thinks to himself, grinning. Juan feels so powerful, his mind totally overwritten by the Dragon-part, causing Juan to forget who he truly was.<br />
<br />
“Jeff’s” own transformation has also commenced: his whole body is covered in black fur, except his tummy torso, which is covered in white fur. The “boy’s” tail is also black with a white tip, and his ears, which have become bigger and pointy, are also black with white fur on the tips and insides. “Jeff’s” face pushes out into a cute muzzle as his teeth are replaced with sharp pointy canines, his tiny erect cock merges with his tummy, becoming a sheath, while the pink tip grows, changing shape until its a canine-like cock, including a tiny knot.<br />
<br />
The two look at each other, then at themselves, “I must say,” Juan says, smirking, “I LOVE what I am seeing!”<br />
<br />
“Jeff” nods, “even… damn my voice sounds sooooo girly… even though I am 12… I kinda like my appearance”.<br />
<br />
“I think you look cuter than before, Jeff,” Juan says.<br />
<br />
“Jeff” looks up at Juan, “y-you sound different… and… and why are you looking at me like… that?”</p>
