<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After looking at the ornate carving of the frame of the mirror you look again into the mirror itself.  You again scratch your ears absent-mindedly, and then you notice that in this mirror your ears look like the ears of a elf!  Cool! You gigge this mirror is far out you cry, followed by a small boyish break out of laughter.  You then look at the mirror again and realize that the mirror is simply a normal one.  looking down the hall you see the various warped mirrors that normally are featured inside of a funhouse.  you with anticipitation go down the hall way and look into each mirror.  You laugh at how the mirrors change the way you look from short and fat to tall and skinny.  after the hall of mirrors a moving floor takes you past what looks like at first animatronic boys who look like they are wearing donkey costumes.  in the last scene you realive that they are no machines but real boys dressed up.  you laugh at one boy who seems to be trying to get out of the room he is performing in.  By the end of the show it seems to you that you have been laughing too much.  Your voice has taken on a slight raspy tone to it but otherwise appears completely normal.  At the top the hall you see a boy on all fours being whipped by a scantilly clad woman using a small leather switch.  The boy looks to you to be wearing a Donkey costume that included only the head, tail, and ears.  Otherwise the only clothes he was wearing was his boxer shorts.<br />
<br />
The hallway then turns away from the scene and you come to a steep staircase.  you grab the Railing and step onto it after looking back and seeing a sliding panel had shut behind you.  &quot;Typical Fun House stunt you giggle,&quot; as you put both of your feet onto the top step of the sairs only to have as you expected it to give way under you and turn into a greased ramp.  Your arms flail as you slide down the ramp and into the door you did not see at the bottom and you find yourself back outside on the main broadway of the park.  You Break out in laughter at the trick they pulled on you.<br />
<br />
You get up and brush yourself off and head down the walk and into the billiards parlor down the street.  You go in and find dozens of boys playing pool with each other and others lounging in couches and dring bear.  You notice something odd though all of the boys have pulled their hats down over the ears.  you touch your ears again and notice that the are slightly pointy, and elf-like.  You shrug it off without a thought and dive into an armchair next to one pool table and watch four boys play.  A girl dressed in a very short mini-skirt hands you a large stien of beer, but you are more interested in the game in front of you.  You immeditally realize that one boy who wear a loose pair of trousers that barely say on is obvious cheating but none of the others seem to realize this.  You Giggle slightly at the thought of the boy getting caught, when you notice his hat raise on his head slightly.  You are so transfixed watching the boy you do not see several boys laughing strangly on the other side of the room grabbing their rears and then running into the large mens room.  When you look up you see that about a half a dozen of the boys in the room have dissapeared, &quot;must have gotten bored and left.&quot; you thought to yourself and returned to watching the boy playing near you.  You realize that everyone else in the room seems to be watching the boy too, when you see his hat raise farther off of his head.  The boy stops making his shot to pull it back down over his ears and then resests to make his shot and after hiting the cue you see him bounce the table with his knee as the cue hits the red ball next to the pocket knocking it in.  He sets up for another shot when his hat pops of without him noticing it.  With your mouth wide open you look and can't beleive what you are seeing.  The boy is sporting a full pair of donkey ears.  Most of the boys have started breaking out in a strangly raspy launghter, which soon breaks into mocking donkey brays.  The Boy looks up thinking he was caught in his little cheat and then goes back to playing.  You then see several other boys reach up to their own ears and then blushing rush into the bathroom.  The room is now almost empty other than a half a dozen boys and those playing at the table next to you.  You suddenly head screams of terror coming from the bathroom but you are too busy watching the boy play.  After making yep another shot you then notice that the boys trowsers look straingly odd.  Then you see it, the boy has a large lump sticking out of the top of his rear end.  you look away from him at the other boys playing with him to see them placing theie index fingers next to their own ears copying the movment of the cheaters donkey ears when their hats fall off revealing their own long donkey ears.<br />
<br />
Unthinking you reach up and scratch an itch on your own ear to realize that you have a slight fuzz growing on your ears.  You pull your own hat down over you own ears to hide any embearesment.<br />
<br />
You then look back at the cheater who is now playing with everyone else now staring transfixed as a long donkey tail sprouts from the oblivious boy's rear.  The more he cheated the faster the changes begin to happen.  He looks away from you and when he turned back he now had a almost human donkey face witch quickly changed into a full donkey muzzle.  The Boy now laughed loudly As he hit and sunk the last solid ball.<br />
<br />
Ha Ha HA HAW!<br />
<br />
You put fingers in your ears and attempt to clean them out.  Did you just hear the boy bray like a donkey?  Giggleing the Boy calls out, &quot;8-Ball corner pocket.&quot;  He said pointing with his hand and then he prepared to make his shot when he suddenly dropped his cue stick.  The boy suddely became aware of the donkey tail on his hind quarters.  Crying out in shock he pulled at it, yes it was part of him!  Seeming resolute on winning he picks up his cue and again prepares to make his shot when the hand sitting on the table balls up ito a fist and then turns into a large black hoof just as he makes his shot causing the cue ball to fly off the table knocking the hat off of on of the other boys, the boy's full donkey ears coming into full veiw.  That boy is you!<br />
<br />
In dismay the cheater looks at his right hand Not beleiveing what he is seeing.  The clatter of him dropping his stick alerts you to the fact that his other hand has also changed into a black donkey hoof.  Holdong his hands in front of him the boy cries out.  &quot;What is Heeappening to meehaw?  SomeHeeHaw one Heehawhheehaweeelp MeeeeHaw!&quot;  The boy began to wobble on his feet and beind him boys had come out of the bathroom half of them sprouting Donkey ears and tails.  The boy you are watch wabbles more as if fighting the erge to go down onto all fours, trying to hold onld to his humanity.  &quot;I HeehAWW HEE HAW Can't KeeHeeHaweep my seeHEEhawlf StaHEEhawnding HeeeUpprHAAAWight&quot;  The boy strains to say as he wobbles about as he does so you notice he now has a full donkey main and his neck has grown out to look just like that of a donkey.  Truly the boy looks like a boy wearing a very convincing donkey costume.  You see that his feet still look quite normal.  <br />
<br />
&quot;heehawhheehaweeelp Mheehawheehaweeeee.  Ihheeehaaaw D-D-D-oooHawn't Whawnt tooohaw beeeheeehaw a Dooonkheeeeehaw!.&quot;  The boys strains to say as he stumbles about, flailing his arms.  Suddenly he loses he balance and lands With a loud clomping sound onto his hooves that used to be his hands.  Getting onto his knees he begins to plead to you.  &quot;Pleehaaawasssse Heeellp mheeeehaw u-uu-p, P-p-plheeeehaaawse.&quot;  The boy pleaded to you then all of the sudden you see his shoes fall of and his feet turn into hooves as well.  The Boy Srarts sobbing in front of you <br />
<br />
&quot;Wahh!  Boo hoo boo hoo I Dooheeehaw Wheeehaehhhaent to-to-to Bheehawheeaw haw Dooheeehawheehawnkheeehawheehawey.&quot;  The boy then become completely intellegable and the only sounds he can make are the braying sounds of a donkey.  The donkey then runs out of the pool parlor and into the night.<br />
<br />
You laugh at the boy's prediciment <br />
&quot;Ha ha Ha HA HA HeeHaw&quot;  Comes out of you lips and you put you hand to you mouth.  Your ears are already twitching on the top of your head and suddenly uncomfortable...</p>
