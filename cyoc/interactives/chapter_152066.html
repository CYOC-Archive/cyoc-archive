<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Mika I do have one question,” Kellie asked. “Are you from a different timeline?”<br />
<br />
“No I’m from here,” Mika said. “I know it can be a bit confusing. Lilith offered Circes followers from a different timeline when i originally went to meet with them. They took me instead after I made my offer, so the Kitsune worked some magic to kind of send me back in time to live as one of them.”<br />
<br />
“And I thought reality alterations gave me a headache,” Kellie mumbled as she rubbed her head. Taking a deep breath she now smiled at her friend, hugging her once more. “Just So you know I don’t have anything personal against the Kitsune or even anthros. I’m just cautious, especially when Circe or Lilith are involved.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Mika said warmly. “So how should we introduce Tatsu and Shizen to the other Mika and Claudia?”<br />
<br />
Kellie spent the next few minutes explaining her plan to Mika. The teen would retrieve the other Mika and Claudia as well as Kellies daughter Katie, making sure Katie knew what was going on. When the three college age women arrived in the cabin Kellie would put them at ease before introducing the two celestial Kitsune. Hopefully with Katie’s help she would be able to keep Mika and Claudia from attacking. As the three now entered the cabin Kellie smiled. “Good to see you.”<br />
<br />
“Hey Kellie,” Mika said warmly. “Nice place you and Merlin rented.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks Mika,” Kellie said. “Glad you could make it.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks for having us,” Claudia smiled. “Been needing to get away for awhile. Hasn’t exactly been the easiest summer: Not since Kari came into our lives.”<br />
<br />
Kellie felt her cheeks flush as she now rubbed the back of her neck. “About Kari,” she said sheepishly. “There’s a couple of people I want to introduce you too. Don’t freak out though okay, it’s nothing bad.” Mika and Claudia gave the teen a curious look as she now motioned towards the other side of the cabin. In a swirl of mist Tatsu and Shizen now emerged, a small smile on their faces as they stood next to the playpen the children were sleeping in. <br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia said nothing, their eyes narrowing as they stared at the two Kitsune. Kellie looked the two women over noticing that although neither had attacked yet, Claudia was already useing her magic to create a ball of fire in her hands. “Mika, Claudia,” Kellie said nervously. “They’re not her to fight okay?”<br />
<br />
“Merlin’s daughter speaks the truth,” Shizen said warmly. “We have merely come to talk with both of you.”<br />
<br />
“That’s great and all,” Mika grumbled. “But we’ve been attacked twice now by Kitsune.”<br />
<br />
“And the last one damn near crippled me,” Claudia added.<br />
<br />
“Our apologies,” Tatsu said sincerely. “The actions of Yomis children and our son Fukushu were uncalled for. We hold neither of you any ill will. We have simply come to talk about your daughter Kari.” While Mika and Claudia said nothing, Kellie could see both women tense up at the mention of their adoptive daughter. The ball of fire in Claudia’s hand growing slightly larger as she glared at the two Kitsune.<br />
<br />
“Girls,” Kellie said nervously. “Tatsu and Shizen haven’t come to cause any harm. They actually love how well you’ve taken care of Kari. You see, those two are Karis parents.”<br />
<br />
“Then maybe they can explain why Kari was left all by herself in this timeline,” Mika grumbled, “And why were only hearing this what, four months after the fact.”<br />
<br />
“That and if they think they’re taking her without a fight they have another thing coming,” Claudia added. “She’s our daughter and I don’t care if it kills me. I’m not letting anyone take her from us.”<br />
<br />
“We would not dare take her from you,” Tatsu stated. “We have seen how well you care for this child even though she is not your own. Kari can not come back to our clan. She is where she belongs and we wish for you to raise her.”<br />
<br />
“What my husband and I would like though is to be able to visit from time to time,” Shizen added as she pleading looked at the two college women. Claudia and Mika tilted their heads in confusion, aside from Kari they had yet to meet a Kitsune that wasn’t aggressive towards them. Claudia’s spell dissipated as she stepped forward. “So that’s it,” she said, somewhat confused. “You just want to visit from time to time. There’s no catch? Your not going to reclaim her as your own?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Shizen said. “Kari is yours to have. We have seen how much your families care for this child.”<br />
<br />
“I think I can deal with that,” Mika said quietly as she turned towards Claudia. “What do you think Claudia?”<br />
<br />
“As long as you don’t try and take her from us and let us raise her as we see fit then yeah, sounds fair.”<br />
<br />
Kellie breathed a sigh of relief as Mika and Claudia approached the two Kitsune. Tatsu and Shizen bowed to the two women, who in turn returned their bow as a sign of respect. “Wow that went better than I thought,” Kellie said as she turned towards Katie. “I think Mika and Claudia are still a little beat up from their last fight,” Katie smiled. “If they were 100% this might have gone a bit differently.” Mother and daughter smiled as they looked at the couples, not noticing as the door to the cabin now opened.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys,” Samantha said cheerfully. “Thought I saw you come in and just wanted to check on Tricia.” Samantha stopped dead in her tracks, her eyes going wide with terror as she stared at the two adult Kitsune. Samantha had yet to meet a Kitsune but had heard and seen enough to make her wary. Katie, Claudia, and Mika has fought one to rescue her mother. Only recently another had nearly killed Claudia and Mika. Now seeing two adult Kitsune standing only a couple of feet from her sleeping daughter, Samantha felt a mixture of anger and fear swell inside her.<br />
<br />
The noise that emanated from Samantha was deep, almost supernatural, like a whales call only more bone chilling. Samantha’s cry shook the cabin to its very foundations as the others now gazed at the fearful young mother. “Sammy Wait,” Katie called. Samantha had not heard Katie yell, too frightened and concerned at the idea of her daughters life being in danger. The college woman’s eyes now turned a deep purple as she angrily gazed at the Kitsune.<br />
<br />
Kellie watched in shock as Samantha began to change. The woman’s face began to become more feral, her incisors lengthen into fangs. As that was occurring she noticed the muscle in Samantha’s body grow thicker, seeming to strain against her skin. Samantha also seemed to grow a couple of inches, adding to her now Amazonian physique. Looking at the young mothers hands Kellie could see them become slightly larger as her fingernails began to grow out, darkening and becoming claws. Samantha continued to change, her legs becoming thicker, more muscular. As the changes spread down her legs Kellie watched as her feet grew in size, destroying her flip flops as her heel pulled backwards and upwards. The nails on Samantha’s toes also began to darken, becoming a set of talons. As the transformation began to complete itself, Kellie watched as the skin around Samantha’s hands and feet began to toughen, becoming scaly and purple. The sound of clothing ripping shocked Kellie as a long sweeping purple tail burst forth, while a set of purple wings sprang from the girls back. Kellie could now only gasp in shock as she beheld the dragon ness Samantha.<br />
<br />
“GET AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER,” Samantha roared, her voice sounding unworldly. Before anyone could say anything, Samantha’s mighty wings swung upwards before beating downwards, propelling the dragon ness at nearly SuperSonic  speeds.<br />
<br />
Tatsu had been surprised by the woman’s transformation. He knew of the powerful magic they possessed but he never envisioned they would be able to perform such feats. Astounded he watched as the woman rocketed at him, connecting with his midsection and actually knocking him backwards 6 inches. Stunned but amused he turned slightly letting the dragonness go past him.<br />
<br />
Kellie had watched horror struck as Samantha had flown straight at Tatsu. The woman had flown at such speeds that Kellie was convinced she had nearly broken the sound barrier. As she connected with Tatsus midsection she heard the divine Kitsune let out a small grunt. Two things now shocked Kellie. One was the look on Tatsu’s face, she expected him to be angered or alarmed. Instead he appeared, almost amused. Secondly, although the impact on Tatsu was incredible the Kitsune was only knocked backwards perhaps 6 inches. As Samantha now sped past him, she watched as she dug her talons into the floor the slow her momentum, leaving deep grooves in the cabin floor. As Samantha now bellowed once more, ready to attack it was Shizen who now stepped forward, a serene look upon her face.<br />
<br />
“Samantha Davis,” Shizen said in a calm and serene voice. “We mean your daughter no harm. Your desire to protect your child is admirable but we are allies not enemies.”<br />
<br />
Samantha paused, a look of confusion etched on her feral face, as she absorbed Shizen words. Slowly the deep purple of her eyes returned to normal as she took a deep breath. “Your not here to hurt Tricia,” she asked, her voice no longer as foreboding yet still raspy. Shizen shook her head no, smiling warmly at the dragonness before turning towards her husband. “No my husband and I have simply come to ask Claudia and Mika if they shall allow us to visit their daughter.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Samantha said meekly, her face flushing in embarrassment. “Umm, Sorry. My bad.”<br />
<br />
“Do not threat child,” Tatsu chuckled. “I am well aware of a mother’s deep seeded desire to protect their child. Besides, I am impressed by your power. It takes an incredible amount of strength to even move a celestial being such as myself.”<br />
<br />
“Celestial being,” Mika asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Shizen said warmly. “Tatsu and I are of a divine nature.”<br />
<br />
“Congratulations Sammy,” Claudia smirked. “You just attacked Kitsune Jesus.”<br />
<br />
Samantha blushed fiercely in embarrassment as she now stammered out an apology. As Kellie watched everything transpire she found herself at a loss for words. It seemed that these Kitsune were perhaps the most forgiving and powerful beings she had ever had the pleasure of meeting.</p>
