<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate was currently laying on her bed, talking with her friends on her phone, she had back length brown hair, green eyes and had a healthy frame.<br />
She lived in a small city, which was surrounded by the forest, it was a very calm place, however, when people started disappearing, almost everyone was put in a state of fear, people often would avoid going outside during the middle of the night, others would add security mesaures to their home, and some would even stay in public areas even during the day.<br />
The government often attributed the disappearances with things such as people searching for their house pets, but instead getting lost within the labyrinth of trees, and others would even link the disappearances to beasts, such as werewolves, and so on.<br />
<br />
Kate never believed that people went missing due to some creatures from mythology, legends or any other story, infact, she would often go in the middle of the night with her friends, and none of them currently disappeared.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Kate slowly became bored, she looked over at her laptop, which stood on her desk, along with some of her books and school materials, she went over to pick it up and place it on her bed, she plugged in its battery and booted it up.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t in the mood to to play the current games she had installed, she wanted to try something different, so she searched around the internet and found the site itself, &quot;Moonlight Rhapsody.&quot;<br />
Her friends, and some of the other classmates talked about the game almost every single day, claiming that it sounded really interesting, and even saying that it should be the game of the year.<br />
Without a second thought, she clicked on the link, and was greeted by the mainpage of the game, it had a pretty aesthetic, consisting of black and blue, on the top left of the site was &quot;Moonlight Rhapsody&quot;, written in a fancy font.<br />
Kate didn&#39;t have enough time to admire its aesthetic as soon as she was greeted up by a message, which said: &quot;Select your origin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate then looked under the message, seeing multiple choices, ranging from &quot;Bitten by an Animal&quot; to &quot;Science experiment&quot; , she carefully inspected each one, before looking back at the first option, showing the traits it brings;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitten by an Animal&quot; - You were bitten by an animal, which &#39;blessed&#39; you with the strength of the beast.<br />
• Infectious : You can transfer your condition through your blood, saliva and other bodily fluids.<br />
• Lunar blessing : During a full moon, you become immune to all forms of harm, whether physical or spiritual, however, you won&#39;t be able to transform during a new moon.<br />
• Genetic : You have a chance to pass the condition to any offspring you&#39;ll have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, offspring? This game has the ability to raise a family with someone as well?&quot; thought Kate, no matter, she clicked on the &quot;Bitten by an Animal&quot; option and clicked confirm, taking her to another selection, another message popped up, which said &quot;Choose your creature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate was then stunned at the amount of &quot;weres&quot; she could choose from; werewolf, werelion, werebear, werebat and even other interesting ones such as wererat, wereshark, werehorse, werecrocodile and even weredragon. Although she already knew what she wanted to choose;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Werewolf&quot; - The first, the original, created by the mother of beasts herself, a man or woman who can turn into a bipedal wolf.<br />
• Claws of the Beast : Your claws never fail you, they can cut through most objects.<br />
• Night vision : Your eyes are enhanced, they can see through the darkness clearly.<br />
<br />
Kate quickly selected &quot;The Werewolf&quot; and pressed confirm without hesitation, bringing her to another selection, a message popped up again, which said : &quot;Choose your class.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was slightly disappointed to only see two classes, however, under the second one was a message by the author himself or herself which stated that more classes will be implemented in the future, she then looked at the two classes she had to choose, which were the &quot;Juggernaut&quot; and the &quot;Farseer&quot; each one coming with two positive traits and a negative one, she looked at the two for a few minutes, until finally deciding what class she will choose;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Juggernaut.&quot; - A powerful and immovable force, warriors blessed by the mother of beasts with abnornal strength. It&#39;s said that juggernauts are often seen as excellent mothers or fathers, due to their powerful seed and rapid growth of the offspring within the womb.<br />
+ Unnatural Strength : You can easily overpower most foes, and have an added bonus to your stamina.<br />
+ Quick Recovery : You recover much faster from  concussions and other temporary effects such as confusion, etc.<br />
- Libido : Your desire to mate claws at your mind, after the transformation, you gain a desire to mate. The seed of male juggernauts causes the offspring to be much healthier, with a powerful immune system and other enhanced organs. Meanwhile, the offspring of female juggernauts will develop faster in the womb.<br />
<br />
The negative trait slightly creeped Kate out, hopefully there are options to censor the game, she clicked on &quot;The Juggernaut&quot; and confirmed her choice again, she was later brought to another selection, the final one, which showed additional positive and negative traits, Kate had the option to pick 3 positive traits, and could select additional ones if she would select some of the negative traits, she decided to select &quot;Immortality&quot; to stop the progress of aging at the age of 20, &quot;Perfected Immune system&quot; to make her immune to disease and poison, and &quot;Gender Change&quot; since, despite the fact that it will change the gender of her character to the opposite one, it gives as an increasement to stamina, she then was about to click &quot;Create Character&quot; but decieded to add the negative trait &quot;Painful Change&quot; to cause the transformation to be slow and painful, so that she could add the positive trait &quot;Primal Hunter&quot; to make her senses better.<br />
<br />
After checking the stats of her soon to be character again, Kate nodded, and pressed &quot;Create Character.&quot; However, when it said &quot;Loading...&quot; the site closed. Kate thought that maybe the owner was running a maintenance, so she closed her laptop and placed it back on her desk, unknowing of what will soon happen to her.</p>
