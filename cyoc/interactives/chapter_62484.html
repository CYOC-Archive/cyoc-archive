<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Finally,&quot; David thought as he slipped out of the bed he was sharing with Jason and left the room quietly, &quot;I thought he'd never let go of <br />
me. Although, that might not be such a bad thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled at the memories of what had happened earlier that night. When they had all come back to the suite to fuck, Jason had taken <br />
him straight to his room. The bed was soft and Jason was a cute, romantic fox; the sex was amazing and so was Jason. David hoped <br />
he wouldn't get caught; he didn't want to lose Jason because he was paid to snap pictures of his friend. <br />
<br />
He didn't have anything against Fisk Vex, but the $800 he was being paid to take a picture of the sleeping otter would come in handy for <br />
a struggling college student. And the opportunity had been practically laid in his lap! Besides, what's the worst story someone could <br />
make up about a guy sleeping? He hadn't taken it while the girl was with him, that would've been too embarassing. He wanted as <br />
innocent a photo as possible to protect Fisk. <br />
<br />
He slowly poked his head in the cracked door and looked to make sure his target was asleep. The slow breathing and occasional light <br />
snore were reassuring enough for the lab to continue. He approached the bed and jumped when Fisk rolled onto his back in his sleep. <br />
He was stark naked, his big cock hanging to the side on top of his sizeable balls. David got hard at the sight, but forced himself to <br />
focus on taking the picture. <br />
<br />
If he took it from the chest up, there would be nothing to make out of it. The camera was an expensive one with night vision capabilities <br />
and there was enough light from the window that he could take a picture without flash. David raised the camera, aimed from the top abs <br />
up and snapped a couple photos from different angles.<br />
<br />
When he finished, he set the camera softly on the desk. He then got on his knees next to the bed and gazed at the amazing organ in <br />
front of him. The pale flesh was illuminated slightly by the glowing purple fur across Fisk's left eye. David wondered how he got his fur <br />
that way, it was so cool...and sexy. <br />
<br />
&quot;A little feel couldn't hurt,&quot; David thought to himself. <br />
<br />
The lab reached out to the long, thick organ and lightly wrapped his hand around it. Fisk didn't wake up, so he continued. He used his <br />
other hand to cup the otter's large balls, feeling the heat of the organs and smelling the musky odor. Fisk muttered incoherently in his <br />
sleep as the touching gave him an erection. The organ grew even more and David was tempted not to jump on the godly piece of meat. <br />
<br />
David was still naked, too, and felt his own member get stiffer than it had ever been in his life. The sleeping hand job was turning his on <br />
more than anything else ever had. He took one hand away from Fisk's balls and began to slowly jack himself off. He closed his eyes <br />
and imagined himself in a threeway with Jason and Fisk. Their human friend on the side filming everything and masturbating. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, David felt something wrap around his waist. His eyes flew open to see a thick, furred tentacle extending from Fisk's shoulder <br />
and lifting him off the ground. Before he could scream, another tentacle from his other shoulder forced itself into his mouth, effectively <br />
acting as a gag. David was afraid of what would happen next. <br />
<br />
The tentacle around his waist lowered him above Fisk's now fully-erect member. A third tentacle, this one smaller, emerged from above <br />
the otter's navel and snaked its way to David's ass. David tried to get away, but the tentacle was too strong. The smaller tentacle slowly <br />
stuck itself into his anus and began to widen his ass as it moved further up. Two more tentacles sprouted from Fisk's legs and forced <br />
the dog's legs aprt so that his hole was nice and wide. <br />
<br />
David felt conflicted. He knew what was coming was exactly what he wanted, but it wasn't happening how he imagined it. This had to <br />
be a huge secret, one he doubted even the otter's friends knew about, maybe not even his family. Hell, maybe Fisk didn't even know <br />
about this! Even if he got away from this, David knew he couldn't speak a word of this to anyone. Not that many people would believe <br />
him, but if someone did they might try to force Fisk into doing it. <br />
<br />
The tentacle pulled out of his ass and retracted into Fisk's toned body. David had to admit that as scary and freaky as this was, the otter <br />
was still one of the hottest guys he'd ever seen and he couldn't imagine what that huge cock would feel like inside him. But he soon <br />
found out. The tentacle lowered his stretched, soft ass onto the otter's rock-hard prick. He would have moaned loudly in pleasure had <br />
the second tentacle not been in his mouth. <br />
<br />
Firmly attached to Fisk via penis to anus, the leg and shoulder tentacles released him, leaving only one to keep him quiet. In his sleep, <br />
Fisk reached out with both his strong hands to hold David's waist and began slowly thrusting into the lab. For a moment, David forgot <br />
his situation as the massive meat filled him up. He felt Fisk's pulse through his own rear and longed for that pulse to become the spurts <br />
of cum from those mighty balls. <br />
<br />
Fisk's thrusts slowly became faster as the otter picked up the pace. David felt his own orgasm building as the otter pulled him almost off <br />
before slamming him back on again. Another small tentacle popped out of Fisk's bicep and began to stroke David's cock. Already so <br />
close, David didn't last much longer before he came all over Fisk's face...and the otter's eyes flitted open.</p>
