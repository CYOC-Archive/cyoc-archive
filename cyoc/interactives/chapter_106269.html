<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Then my only question is here or back in the cabana?&quot; asked Eric, as he felt the stirrings in his loins begin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not both?&quot; asked his fiance in return, before kissing him again.<br />
<br />
And the kiss was wonderful and Eric felt Julie press her naked body against his. Her larger breasts in her Stage 3 form compressed against his more toned chest and Eric could literally feel her nipples hardening as they kissed. It only served to arouse him as he could feel the vent in his own tail open and his larger mer-penis begin to telescope out of it. When it touched the scales on Julie&#39;s tail, she broke the kiss and smiled to him.  Her eyes twinkled with joy and happiness and the glow around her that told Eric SHE was his one true love only made him smile back. He had once been nervous over a were&#39;s whole libido issue when Ben and Nate had been talking about it when they had their &quot;sleep over&quot; while Martha became a werecat, as he feared that weres had no control over that issue. Now, though, he knew that wasn&#39;t the case and as gently rubbed Julie&#39;s right breast with one hand while sliding the other down her sides and to her goldfish tail and then to her own opening vent, where he soon found her vagina and her clit inside it.<br />
<br />
Eric felt perfectly in control of himself and he was with the person he wanted to spend his next four centuries with. He wanted to make her happy. He wanted to make her laugh. He wanted to make sweet love to her and show her just how MUCH he loved her. Julie gave a low moan at his attention to her and came closer, and Eric could soon feel both her hands touch and gently stroke his now fully erect member. It made him give a low moan in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it... oh... that you&#39;re in favor of both?&quot; Julie smiled to him  as they continued, feeling herself beginning to grow wet as Eric massaged her breasts and her clit that went beyond being under water. Eric&#39;s touch was soft and gentle and very arousing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so,&quot; Eric smiled back to him, holding back moaning at Julie&#39;s stroking of his penis, &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful... so loving... so kind... so patient... so helpful... You are the bright jewel of my love that I will always treasure for all of my days. And right now I want to make you very happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he then moved to caress the sides of Julie&#39;s head to kiss her passionately. Julie returned it eagerly as well as the next kiss and the one after that. After a few moments, they did break apart and Julie took Eric&#39;s webbed hands and slowly began to suck on his fingers, tasting her own sexual juices on them and feeling her self growing even more aroused as Eric&#39;s penis was pressed against the outside of her tail. She loved him dearly and had ever since she first saw him, and while a good part of her may have wanted to have him as her weremerman as quickly as she could, that didn&#39;t quite fit in with what was right. Forcing Eric wouldn&#39;t be an act of love, even if she loved him. She loved him and had wanted him to be happy and that if he did choose to be a weremer, it was because he TRULY WANTED to be a weremer. Not because she wanted him to be. Not because Yvette Smith might claw him if she couldn&#39;t get her claws into William again. She wanted their love to be the perfect storybook romance of boy meets girl, they fall in love, and they live happily ever after, and she didn&#39;t care if the High School rumor mill thought that mentality among weremers to be silly. It had worked out for her parents, and as she raised herself up in the water so that her open vent and her aroused and stimulated vagina was over Eric&#39;s erect penis, she knew it had worked for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make me happy by being you,&quot; Julie answered with moaning breath as she lowered herself down and felt Eric&#39;s large merman penis stretch her vaginal opening, privately knowing that as the two of them matured, Eric would grow bigger and that so would she, &quot;bookish and kind... strong yet thoughtful... interesting and loving... handsome yet modest. You&#39;re everything anyone would want in a mate, be they were or normal. I&#39;m just glad that I caught your eye and got the first chance to show you just how much I... oooohhhh... yesss... that I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric smiled, giving a low moan as he thrust his hips and tail forward, pushing member into his fiance&#39;s opening.  Julie&#39;s vaginal muscles were strong and they gripped him tightly and seemed to massage every inch of  his penis with great care and pleasure. As they began with their morning love making session, he also felt Julie&#39;s hands slide over his chest, even as she tried to push her breasts as close to him as possible and then massage the tender areas on his sides and on his back near his gills in his Stage 3 form. It added to his own pleasure as he held Julie to him and showered her with kisses, some on the lips, some on her neck and shoulders, and some on her breasts. Occasionally he felt Julie quiver on his rod, and knew that he&#39;d brought her a strong orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... ooohhh... glad... yooooooouuu... were... ooooooohhhhhhh god... yeeeeeessss... tooooo have... your love,&quot; Eric moaned back, feeling the pleasure build in his penis and through his entire body, &quot;I&#39;m... glad... ooooooohhhhh yeeeeeeessss... tooooo loooooooooove yooooooou!&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie smile and kissed her loving fiance as she felt Eric&#39;s penis begin to twitch inside her. He was getting close and Julie could feel it and she knew she was getting close again to another orgasm. They&#39;d had their moments of clumsiness and inexperience with sex, but Eric had gotten help from either his father or something that gave him good pointers and he did his best to be gentle and respond to Julie&#39;s actions and reactions to him. It made her feel good and she felt her love for him grow with each thrust into her that she made. The sex between them was good and seemed to be growing better with each thrust Eric made into her, but their love was built on much more than that. In fact, it was only now, after their time hanging out at lunch, their walking tour of the town, their walks home, their fun conversations, their dance practices, and everything they had done while Eric was still only a normal that she was truly actively thinking about sex with Eric. Their love was strong in all the right ways, and Julie was fairly sure that she and Eric were close enough that they would stay together even if they never had sex and Eric spent all his life as a normal. <br />
<br />
But, their love grew to the point where if Eric was to become a were of some other variety than a weremer, he needed to make it and go through with it before his and Julie&#39;s bond pulled them into completing Eric&#39;s transformation due to need rather than love. However, the fear of a loss of control never happened as Eric not only made his choice, but chose to a weremerman, Julie&#39;s weremerman and that made Julie&#39;s heart soar, as their first time was a moment of true love. Every moment since was a moment of true love as well, and seeing him now, with his own blue eyes twinkling just as he saw her eyes twinkling, Julie knew that love was driving them now more than lust and a were&#39;s naturally high libido. Eric was glad to be able to love her and she was glad to be able to love him and that both of them could be together in every possible way. Feeling Eric&#39;s arms around her, his penis inside her, his blue green tail as it thrust Eric forward toward her and making her respond in kind on her goldfish tail, and his warmth felt so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting close,&quot; Eric said to her slowly as he continued to thrust into her, feeling very close to being ready to cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... am... I,&quot; Julie moaned back as Eric pressed himself as deeply into her as he could. He also softly nibbled on her neck. &quot;Cum in me, darling... Do... doooooooo it! I love you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, as if on cue, both of them felt their bodies shudder from head to tail-fin as they moaned each other&#39;s name as they came. They both then smiled to each other as they basked in the afterglow of their loving morning. After a moment, Julie pulled off of him and began to move toward the surface and the edge of the pool. Eric followed dutifully.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I&#39;ll probably have to go home for tonight,&quot; Eric commented with Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Sunday, so it is a school night,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;and we&#39;ll have to be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded as they surfaced and pulled themselves out of the pool. Once on the surface of the patio, both shifted from Stage 3 to Stage 2. Eric felt his tail split into two muscular but still scaled legs while his tail-fin thickened and while they remained more like a sea-lion&#39;s flipper in appearance, they would have the strength to support standing on the ground on his feet. The process tingled a little, and in a way, he&#39;d felt the act of transforming felt good, and it left Eric with a slightly goofy smile as he followed Julie toward the cabana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Eric said to her after a moment, &quot;but... I was wondering... what will we do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After making each other very happy?&quot; Julie wondered and turning back to her fiance, seeing Eric&#39;s penis already beginning to grow erect again. It helped raise her arousal as she opened the cabana door, &quot;I was thinking we can go for a bit of a walk... talk about how good it has been for us to have found each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric only smiled and followed Julie in, fully ready for the next round.</p>
