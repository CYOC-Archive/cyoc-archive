<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike had second thoughts when shown a room to get changed in. He knew he/she couldn&#39;t stay in the dirty overalls but the idea of wearing a dress scared the daylights out of him/her. Feeling very self conscious. Mike locked the door and examined himself in a mirror. &#39;Himself&#39; probably wasn&#39;t the right word anymore. <br />
<br />
Firstly he took off his now oversized overalls. He didn’t need to remove his boots as somewhere along the way he had already lost them. His feet were apparently now too dainty.<br />
<br />
Removing the baggy overall’s highlighted just how much his body had changed. He was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. The t-shirt now projected outwards thanks to two massive melons growing on his chest. He undid the belt on his shorts and they fell to the floor. Mike was immediately aware of the piece of his anatomy now missing from between his legs. Forlornly his hand reached down and felt the void under his underwear. He had seen his face in the mirror earlier. It had been a replica of Diana’s. Now it hit home that it wasn’t just his face that had changed. His body had changed as well. He was a female. All the physical evidence was telling Mike that she was a woman. However it was hard to start thinking of &#39;Herself&#39; as a &#39;She&#39;.<br />
<br />
She examined the clothes she had been given. The panties were lacy and and a lavender colour. The dress was silvery grey and made of some sort of stretchy metallic looking material. She couldn&#39;t see any arm holes. She then looked at the shoes. They were silver, roughly the same colour as the dress and had 3 inch heels. Was she even going to be able to walk in them?<br />
<br />
She examined the legs protruding beneath the underwear. They were shapely and hairless. she pulled off his T-shirt and for the first time saw her large breasts. They seemed impossibly large and the pink nipples were sticking straight out. Mike cupped them both with her now feminine hands and weighed them. She lifted them and squeezed them together creating a chasm between them. She had cleavage! She had secretly admired Diana’s body from afar. She had never imagined touching Diana&#39;s breasts – yet here she now was doing exactly that.<br />
<br />
Then Mike took a moment to peer past her breasts to her groin. His underwear was reasonably tight against her now larger hips but the front was loose. There was no longer anything filling the pocket designed to accommodate his dick and balls. Mike pulled the underwear outwards and got his first view of his new groin. He now possessed a small landing strip of blonde pubes but no bulge. His groin was flat.<br />
He heard noises outside. He recognised Bill’s voice. “Where has that body double gone? I have a contract for her. Honey! Where are you?” Mike stayed silent.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t remain here naked. She picked up the garment she had been given. It was some sort of dress alright but she wasn&#39;t sure how she was meant to put it on. She located a zip and assumed that was the back.<br />
<br />
First though she had to put panties on. Her old undies came off easily enough. Then she stepped into the lavender panties and pulled them up. Somehow she felt guilty being totally naked in Diana&#39;s body or at least a copy of Diana&#39;s body. They fit very snugly on her body. There was no mistaking her flat groin.<br />
<br />
It had gone quite outside but no doubt Bill was still looking for her. She couldn’t be naked. Sooner or later she would have to face the world as the woman she now was. How did it happen anyway? Was it something to do with that strange medallion she had found? Briefly she considered putting the overalls back on but she now saw how stained and dirty they were. The contrast to the shiny dress was total. If she wanted this job then she would have to put the dress on. And the money spoke. $2000 a day was a months rent in a day. For someone who struggled to make ends meet that was an amazing wage.<br />
<br />
She unzipped the dress and stepped into it. There were no straps but there were built in cups that made it obvious where her breasts should go. It seemed it was designed to be worn without a bra. That was probably a good thing as Mike didn&#39;t know how to put a bra on. It was difficult to reach around for the zip. The dress seemed very tight, which was amazing as although &#39;stacked&#39; Dianna had a very thin waist. It took a bit of maneuvering but eventually she managed to pull the zip up. She then looked at her reflection in the mirror. A sexy woman with an hourglass figure was looking back at her.  <br />
<br />
She stuck her head out the door and looked around. No one was in the room. She could hear voices further down the corridor though. The wardrobe room was next door. She decided he would find a coat in there before looking for Bill or Diane. She wasn’t comfortable in this sexy dress. <br />
<br />
Once more she contemplated the shoes. The heels were about 3 inches in height. It was either wear them or be barefoot as he had no idea where his boots were. He decided he could manage them and slipped his feet into them. They were not as uncomfortable as the looked. Tentatively he took a couple of steps. He was surprised as he was able to walk with no difficulty. Little did he know that the medallion as well as giving him Diana’s body had given him her ability to walk in heels.</p>
