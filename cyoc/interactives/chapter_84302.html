<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“C’mon sweetie.” Drake’s mom picked him up again and carried him towards the living room. Drake clung to her tightly, still unaccustomed to his much smaller size and jittery about being lifted so far from the ground. The difference in his relative size to his now gigantic mom, at least from his preschool perspective, was further off-putting. I should be taller than her…<br />
<br />
His mother set him down inside the playpen in the family room that hadn’t been there this morning. “Now be good, honey. Mama’s going to go put dinner on. Don’t be scared, I’ll be right in the other room.”<br />
<br />
Drake watched speechless as she left the room, taking in his surroundings dumbfoundedly. The playpen was filled with kiddie toys: stuffed animals, picture books, toy cars, action figures – everything a tot such as himself could want or need. Drake grasped the plastic bars, staring forlornly at the latch above him, out of reach on the other side of the bars. He was jailed in this pen until someone let him out. Even worse, he realized as he fumbled at the diaper’s clasps awkwardly with his uncoordinated little hands, he was trapped in his humiliating baby’s apparel until someone took it off for him – perhaps for *gulp* a changing. And his own body was the worst prison of all – he was stuck as a toddler until he could get back to that damn genie! How did this happen? He thought despondently, biting his lip as he felt tears again begin to well in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Perhaps luckily, he wasn’t left alone with his thoughts for long. “Ok, Drakie!” His mother returned, smiling brightly down at her tiny son. “Time for your bath!”<br />
<br />
Drake turned white as his mother bent into the playpen and again hoisted him into her arms. Could this get any worse? “ ‘s-okay, mom! I’m clean!” He protested shrilly as she carried him into the bathroom. His mother paid her little boy no mind.<br />
<br />
She set Drake down on his feet on the tile floor, making quick work of the diaper’s clasps. “I don’t know why I even put this on you… should have just let you run around buck naked for a while.” She muttered as the diaper fluttered towards the floor around his ankles. Drake whimpered, clamping his little hands over his littler boyhood, stomach wrenching with shame. He never would have imagined that he’d be yearning to be back, swaddled in his diaper, but it was better than being nude in front of his mother, nothing but a bare-assed toddler!<br />
<br />
“Now you have modesty?” his mom asked, amused. “No need sweetie,” she said, lifting him to eye-level, pulling his arms away from his crotch, leaving him utterly exposed. She studied his tiny, naked form, with a mother’s loving eye. Drake wriggled helplessly in her grasp, both sets of cheeks turning red, mortified at this intensely embarrassing position. “Not when you’re this cute,” she said, giving his horrifyingly tiny penis a gentle, good-natured flick. She set the naked toddler back down at her feet, where he stood stunned and aghast at what had just happened. Drake had never been more humiliated in his life. <br />
<br />
His mother hummed an off-key tune as she moved past Drake, who was standing motionlessly, his juvenile body burning with shame. She turned the water on in the bath, when a buzzer went off. “Shoot! Dinner…” she murmured, looking towards the kitchen. “You stay here, little one,” She said, smiling lovingly down at him. “Mama will be right back.” And with that she swept out of the room, pulling the door shut gently behind her. <br />
<br />
Drake trembled nervously as he stood alone in the bathroom. Now was his chance! Who knew when he would get another? He reached down, fiddling clumsily with the diaper around his ankles. He bent over and attempted to pull it back over his diminutive waist and baby’s butt, but wobbled unsteadily on his underdeveloped legs as he went to pull the cloth upwards. With the diaper tangled around his legs, Drake tripped and fell hard onto his chubby little bottom, smacking the tile floor with force. Unable to help himself, his eyes welled with unwanted tears as his rear stung painfully. Too little to even dress myself, he thought miserably, as he kicked out of his diaper and pulled himself shakily back to his tiny feet. No time, anyways. I need to get back to Beldazarr, clothed or not. Standing on his tiptoes, he was just barely able to turn the knob on the bathroom door. Drake stumbled out into the hallway as the door swung open. The naked toddler gathered himself, then tottered towards his bedroom.</p>
