<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning the sun began to shine through the windows, causing Will to slowly stir to life. Though he would've preferred to not continue his newfound humiliation, he knew what he needed to accomplish. He forced his eyes to peer slightly open. He noticed that Megan had yet again gotten up early and left him to himself, it unnerved him that he felt a slight fear when she was gone. Will stretched, feeling his body ache from his ongoing changes. As he stretched he noticed his shirt seemed a tad loose on the shoulders and a little tighter on the chest.<br />
 <br />
Will's eyes darted to his chest, he noticed two small mounds had started to push up under his now puffier nipples. &quot;Just great, now I have tits!&quot; He noticed his voice seemed a higher pitch than normal, but that being the least of his problems, he jumped out of bed and over to the mirror. His reflection startled him slightly, he expected changes but never knew exactly what was going to happen next. Will's hair now looked completely blonde and it was a few inches longer than the night before. &quot;At least I still look like me in the face.&quot; He said as he touched it.<br />
 <br />
Turning to one side, he saw that his chest barely stood out, kind of like a girl at the beginning of puberty. Something you'd see on a thirteen-year-old, not a man. He couldn't believe how much shorter he was now, maybe 5'7&quot;, but his legs looked long, soft and smooth, he felt slightly turned on by the sight of his own legs, it sent shivers down his spine. Still, now he noticed how the boxers were meant to show off his now shapely legs. &quot;Someone's definitely gonna notice this, I'll have to keep to myself a lot today.&quot; Feeling his emotions begin to well up, he decided it was best to just keep going and get ready for work.<br />
 <br />
Going over to his closet, he knew that he could definitely wrap his budding bosom, and wear some taller shoes. Everything was still hideable at this point, he thanked his lucky stars that no one had noticed anything and hoped he could keep it hidden until things were normal...if ever. Will, opening the closet, discovered that all his clothes were gone, say for one outfit and note. Will grabbed the note, immediately reading it aloud. &quot;Hey, Babe!&quot; He cringed at being called that now, it brought images and fears of what he was becoming. &quot;Hope you're having a good morning, anyways, I bought you a new outfit for work. It's smaller and more suited for you body type. I put your normal clothes in storage since they're much to big now, don't worry, I'm getting you more clothes this afternoon. I checked out your chest this morning and your cute little totts are coming in nicely. I thought of that, so there's a bra in the dresser, it should hide them. There's also another pair of boxers...real ones. Ha ha, you look sexy. Love, Megan.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will crumbled the note, he was more than a little upset that she was having fun with this while he could do nothing but dread it. Grabbing the outfit, he threw it on the bed, he raised his shirt over his head, throwing it to the ground, stripping out of his boxers at the same time. He decided not to wear the bra and boxers to prove a point, the suit she got for him looked plenty buff to hide his tiny mounds. &quot;I'll go commando and show her...there's no way I'm wearing a bra.&quot; Deciding he couldn't bare to study more of his changes, he quickly donned the new suit, it did fit him quite formfully. It was white, with a purple collared shirt, he unwittingly left a couple buttons open. <br />
 <br />
Combing his hair in a way he hadn't done since grade school, he nodded satisfied and headed out off to work. As he stepped into his office building, he was in a rush and the first thing he did as he walked in was knock right into someone. He fell onto his now more cushioned rear. &quot;Oof!&quot;<br />
 <br />
The man sounded very apologetic. &quot;I'm so sorry man, I wasn't watching my step.&quot; It was Jacob, he lifted Will up to his feet, quite easily. Jacob's eyes widened as he gazed down at his friend. &quot;Whoa, went a little drastic with the hair color, didn't ya? Never pictured you with golden locks.&quot; He said jokingly to his friend.<br />
 <br />
Jacob was 6'2&quot; tall, thankfully for Will, Megan had bought some high top shoes, which made the difference a little better. He prayed for him not to notice any of the other changes. He felt small and dainty compared to Jacob's studly body. Clearing his throat, he deepened it up a bit as he spoke. &quot;...well, I thought it was time for something different, spruce up the image a little bit. Plus you know Megan, she's always getting on my case to try something new.&quot; They walked on, continuing their conversation as they entered the building, all the while, Will was waiting for his chance to get away from Jacob before he noticed anything odd.<br />
<br />
Megan had been home from shopping for a while, she'd scoped out their bedroom, seeing that Will neglected to wear his bra/boxer combo, which were covered in hearts all in pink satin, another practical joke to further enjoy tormenting her boyfriend, she was feeling a bit guilty, but she saw it as temporary and she was going to enjoy it. &quot;Naughty little girl, going to have to punish her for not wearing her undies.&quot; She said walking out of the bedroom and toward the study and the chronovac.<br />
<br />
Earlier in the day she'd noticed that her changes were slowly becoming more evident, she wouldn't be able to hide it as long as Will could. She was now a match for Will's former buff body physique. Her hair was much shorter now, it was just above her shoulders. Her height increase was now up to 5'9&quot;, making her taller than Will. Megan's body hair had begun to sprout everywhere, even on her face. She'd decided it was best for her to dress in clothes that were neutral, her bra had started becoming more loose as the fat slowly was turning to muscle, she couldn't wait to discard the blasted thing.<br />
<br />
Walking into the study, Megan took a seat, she brought up the Chronovac on the screen. &quot;Okay, time to play with the new girl...&quot; She typed in a few keys and the screen showed Will's office building, highlighting on him. It pictured him at his desk, going over paperwork. She smirked. &quot;Busy little bee, lets play a little.&quot; She once more typed away at the computer, making everyone but Will unaware of any changes that were to take place or that anything was out of the ordinary. She set the time limit for how long he'd be at work. Next she worked on the changes themselves, she began thinking of how to make Will's day more interesting. A smirk covered her face. &quot;Oh I know how to have some fun.&quot;</p>
