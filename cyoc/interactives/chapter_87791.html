<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pink rubber pig woman eating rubber balloons had been another surprise. A good thing Casper guessed since everything be totally predictable would be boring. But still, Casper had imagined the rubber anthros he&#39;d create as a short of ideal, maybe not flawless, but maybe a little step up from the current humanity the way homo sapiens had been a little step up from the monkeys. Them eating almost made them . . . more base somehow. He did note the pig woman&#39;s rears ends were as completely sealed as between her legs. <br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe I should have been more precise when I offered most of my life&#39;s savings to a wizard asking for &#39;a magic ring that turns people into rubber animal people.&#39; Casper thought. He just hoped that things didn&#39;t just end up being humanity with a different face, things not being effected at all was <i>too</i> boring. Maybe he&#39;d see more changes to things at large as he changed more people. <br />
<br />
The pig woman finished her meal, pick up her purse, which had been put down when she changed, and paid for her meal with her credit card, whose face was now of the rubber pig woman, her bar code that was on her rear was on her ID. <br />
<br />
Casper seriously considered changing himself, what was the point of changing humanity and not counting yourself as part of humanity? But Casper hadn&#39;t chosen on a species yet. And he didn&#39;t know if the ring could make NEW changes after the originals had been made. He considered asking the ring to change his species randomly, (bit of poetry to that) but &#39;animal&#39; had a broad definition, he didn&#39;t want to live as a rubber anthro tape worm. <br />
<br />
And could the ring change age and gender? Mindset? Occupation? There so many limits he hadn&#39;t tested. Could it transformation people into rubber anthros of extinct species like say dinosaurs? (Mighty finally answer if they had feathers or not). <br />
<br />
The transformation of the pig woman at least seemed to prove they were NOT just being switched out with rubber people from another universe. <br />
<br />
The wizard did say the ring had rules to keep things interesting. <br />
<br />
Casper tried to change some people n an old black and white photo but nothing changed. Then he tried to change the picture of someone in the news paper. Maybe they either had to be alive or in person to change? Would live TV work then? <br />
<br />
He tried changing Charlie Brown on the comic strip page of a news paper being read by another customer, into a rubber anthro bear, but again no change, guess he couldn&#39;t transform characters who were fiction. <br />
<br />
He thought casually, almost jokingly if he fell for Ashley he&#39;d make himself a rubber lizard too. <br />
<br />
He found himself anticipating seeing Ashley this evening. But lunch didn&#39;t take till seven. That just meant he got plenty of time to still experiment with his ring before it was time to date Ashley, maybe he&#39;d figure out something VERY spectacular to do on their date. Something in his gut told him however that revealing the ring&#39;s existence to Ashley might be a very BAD idea on the first date. <br />
<br />
Casper left the sandwich store, knowing where he wanted to go before his date with Ashley. He had to walk by the park again to get there, and spotted a little girl playing in a tree&#39;s high branch. Her brother (only a year older than her) calling out to her to get down. When their parents came over to tell the same, the innocent child only waved, slipped, and began to fall head first to the group before.<br />
<br />
Casper quickly thought with the ring . . . and in an instant before she hit the ground, the little girl&#39;s dress and everything else had vanished, and her body had turned blue and shinny. Seam lines like a pool toy almost ran along her body between its front and back. Her hands and feet were now cute paws with thumbs, and a rubber tail waved behind her. Her belly was colored pink and shaped like a heart. Triangular ears lay on top of her head her face pushed into a adorable muzzle with whiskler. A bar code clearly visible on her bottom along with a nozzle where she once had her belly button. Her body shape was that of a genderless child, with nothing to imply a boy or girl, except maybe her cute eyelashes and body language. <br />
<br />
Her head hit the ground not with a thud or a crack, but a soft squeak, and she LAUGHED as she bounced a couple of times before landing on the grass without mark on her, giggling to herself. <br />
<br />
The parents were not only not scared or worried, but had never been so, just peacefully watching their rubber cat daughter play. <br />
<br />
Casper decided to see if he could make the girl human again, but the ring didn&#39;t respond. It seemed there was no changing back to human after the change was made. But could he turn them into DIFFERENT rubber anthros after the first transformation? He&#39;d have to see about that later. <br />
<br />
The little cat girl ran around in circles with her still human little brother, and then stepped on a piece of broken glass. Casper held his breath, dreading to see the innocent child deflate or pop. But the blue little cat girl just lifted up her foot innocently and brushed it off, there wasn&#39;t even a scratch on her latex body, the glass bottle seemed the only thing that had been damaged. <br />
<br />
Casper breathed a sigh of relief. That was a close one. Looking at the little brother and the parents, he wondered if transforming parents would in turn transform any children they had into rubber anthros as well. Might be worth experimenting later. But or right now, he gave a thought and some will. He felt maybe it was a bit unfair to transform the sister and not the brother. <br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s skin became shinny and orange, his shoes vanished, and his feet became a second pair of hands but the finger nails weren&#39;t there, his pants and such vanished, but already there was nothing there to see, his body become round and a tiny bit tubby, a long tail curled out of his now sealed up rear which bore a barcode. He was surprised when the boy&#39;s Power Rangers shirt didn&#39;t vanish. But maybe it had to do with it being a piece of self expression rather than modesty. Though it did change shape to fit with his new form. His hands and feet were now identical. His ears became larger, and like his sister he effectively became &#39;bald&#39;, his eyes become larger along with his mouth. <br />
<br />
Ironically his sister then decided to play on the monkey bars while he played on the jungle gym using his tail like it was just another limb. <br />
<br />
As a test, he turned the parents into green rubber kangaroos, but the children didn&#39;t change species. They merely hopped after their children and the other put them in her pouch when it time to go home. <br />
<br />
Smiling to himself, Casper continued on his way.</p>
