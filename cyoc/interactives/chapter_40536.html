<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking onto the back of the store, you hear voices out on the sales floor. You peak around the corner of the door, and see Brenda talking to what looks like a man.<br />
<br />
Brenda sees you and waves, &quot;Hi Mandy, come on over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you walk over you notice that the figure is not a man at all, but a woman dressed in very male clothes.<br />
<br />
Brenda looks at the woman, &quot;I'm sorry, Diane, this is Mandy, Mandy, Diane&quot; as Brenda switches her look between the two of you, and continues, &quot;Diane has a problem here, and I think you can help us.&quot; as she looks at you.<br />
<br />
You look curious and ask, &quot;What problem is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda suggest, &quot;Um, let's go into the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
All three make their way into the back office, and Brenda looks at Diane, &quot;Ok, you can show her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane loosens her pants and pushes them down to her thighs. What you find most curious is a green penis looking flower growing from her stretched vagina. You look up to Diane and ask, &quot;Can I touch it? It is important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane doesn't answer right away, and slowly nods yes.<br />
<br />
As you reach out, and your latex hands make contact with the flower's petals, Diane's body swoons slightly. Surprised you ask &quot;You can feel that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane gasps softly, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are now very curious, &quot;How did this come to grow on you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane says, &quot;I woke up in my bed one morning, and it was there, but not as big. I don't know how it got there. I have not had sex with anyone in a long time, not even my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
You ask, &quot;What do you want to do with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane quickly responds, &quot;I want to remove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say, &quot;I am not sure how this is possible, I have no idea if it can be removed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane please, &quot;Please, you must. I have these urges, I masturbate by pollinating the flower, and I have already made seeds. It's not natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare at Diane, &quot;Diane, I want you to masturbate right now and pollinate yourself right here, and I want you to enjoy it. You find this is a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane's face turns happy, and she waddles backwards to sit down on a nearby chair, and begins to fondle the inner parts of the flower at the end of her shaft.<br />
<br />
Brenda steps over to you and asks, &quot;Is that one of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head and say, &quot;No. I've never seen that before. No scrotum, just plant stuff growing right out of her vagina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda says, &quot;When she came in, she was looking for an anal dildo. Once she saw my sheath and balls, she asked me if I could look at something. And you see what I saw. She has not told her husband, and she can't stop pleasuring herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
You step over and touch Diane's shoulder, and nothing major shows up, she's an average mother of teenage kids, except for her new growth. You notice wet spots where her nipples are. Diane lets out a long gasp as her orgasm hits and smiles as she leans back into the chair. You are very turned on by this, and you want a seed or two. &quot;Diane, can I have few seeds?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane doesn't move her body, and says, &quot;Sure. I'll do that a few more times and that should make about a dozen seeds, like last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Brenda watch as Diane feels recharged within only a few moments, and returns to dancing her finger inside the flower, caressing the inner structures as her body tenses after each caress of the flower's stamen. The bell rings on the door, and Brenda goes back to the front to take care of customers. You continue to stare at this woman. After several cycles of flower sex, she grabs the green shaft and begins to stroke up and down along it's length. After a few moments, you see several bulges begin to travel down the shaft and exit a slit that opens in the middle of the flower. Each seed that comes out is about the size of a pecan. Diane strokes her shaft for several minutes, and 11 of the seeds finally exit the end of the flower. You reach down and pick them up off the floor, and set them inside a small bowl you found nearby.<br />
<br />
Diane looks at you, &quot;I have a while until the urges become too strong to resist. I have several dozen at home. I have been hiding them in the freezer. I dare not plant them, as I don't know what will happen. It is as if this thing makes me do what it wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
You step next to Diane and place your hand on her shoulder. You picture her body is very resilient to pain, and that she must sleep now. Feeling Diane's body go limp, you imagine her vagina is very stretchable. You step around in front of Diane, and kneel down. You use your finger to pry Brenda's vaginal lips away from the shaft. Slowly you work your fingers, then your hand, and then your arm into Brenda's vaginal cavity and finally into her womb, where you find a dense set of roots growing into her uterus. You pause and imagine the woman's womb changing into a stomach, it's lining producing acid. Within moments, the roots begin to separate from the walls. You use your other hand and pull out the huge plant.<br />
<br />
Moments later, you deposit the huge plant on the floor and slide your hand back into Diane's pussy, and restore her womb to a normal uterus lined in latex. This way, if there is any left over plant in her system, or if it changed her DNA, it should not grow back and render Diane sterile.<br />
<br />
You stand up and place your hand on Diane's shoulder, allowing her to wake up and allowing the pain tolerance to return to normal over the next few days, &quot;Go home Diane, forget about this plant of any of what you saw or did here today. If the plant returns, you come back to this store and see Brenda. You are to destroy the seeds in your freezer by eating them. Your stomach acids will destroy them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane pulls up her pants, and tightens them. &quot;Thank you. I know I won't remember you in a few moments, but I am grateful.&quot;<br />
<br />
You point to the doorway, and Diane walks out, says her thanks to Brenda, and leaves the store.<br />
<br />
You return back to the plant and pick it up, and put it on Brenda's desk. Standing up, you slide the dildo out of your vagina, and just as quickly, insert the plant, base first, inside you. Your heart is pounding quickly, as you are very excited. Standing still by the desk, you don't feel any movement. As the moments pass, your heart begins to slow and you wonder if the plant is dead or if it can't bond to you. You sigh, and use your vaginal muscles to massage the shaft. If it is dead or inactive, you can at least get some pleasure from having the large bulb stretching you from the inside. Walking back out, you slip behind the counter and wait for Brenda to finish working with the few customers in the store.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Brenda finishes checking out the last customer at the register and you wait until the store is empty to turn and face Brenda to say, &quot;Look what I got.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda looks surprised, &quot;Is that another one?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile, &quot;Nope, I took it out of Diane. I think I killed it. I don't feel anything special or different. I have some seeds in the back that I will experiment with. We can take them home and see what happens when one of those seeds gets inside one of my eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda reaches down and touches the flower, you feel nothing. &quot;It's very soft. I wonder where it came from&quot; asks Brenda curiously. Brenda pushes the green shaft until just the flower rests against your latex cameltoe. &quot;There, that way it looks like a decoration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of you stare at the flower for a while, and both of you turn to the door when the next customer walks in.</p>
