<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Louis’s Collected Souls:<br/>
Wolf, Orc, Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Hawk’s Collected Souls:<br/>
Hawk, Rat, Rabbit, Snake, Minotaur, Horse (others unknown).</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The ruddy hills that sat on the northern horizon were many days’ travel away, even at a gallop. Louis and Hawk soon settled into a daily routine.<br />
<br />
By day, they rode, stopping only when they chanced upon the occasional berry bushes or the rare pond to wash and drink. In the evening, they rested awhile. Once the sun set, Hawk would fly off to hunt while Louis prepared the fire. When Hawk returned with a rabbit or a crow, Louis would cook it for them. Louis often worried that Hawk may tire after a full day’s trotting and an evening’s hunt, but most nights he would still swell into the minotaur and give Louis a grin. <br />
<br />
Louis’s orc and Hawk’s minotaur were the most common bedfellows, being well suited and sized for each other, although Hawk liked to surprise Louis with other forms. On one such time, Louis had taken the minotaur’s flaccid meat into his mouth and it grew so large he almost choked. When he spat it out, Hawk, now a dun stallion again, whinnied playfully at him. Louis got his revenge the next night by changing into the dragon while Hawk was bouncing on his member.<br />
<br />
Every night, whether they pleasured each other or not, they laid together, watching the dying embers of the fire and talking. On some days, this was the only time they spoke, being one of the few times each day they both had talking mouths. They talked a little about their past, but Hawk didn’t like to talk about what little he remembered and Louis hadn’t much to tell. Most often, Hawk asked Louis questions about why the seasons changed or what made the rivers, for he had never had anyone to tell him before. Louis would explain as best he could and Hawk would listen until they both drifted into sleep.<br />
<br />
They rose at dawn. Louis would become human, dress and gather his things. Hawk didn’t complain about this again, but Louis always sensed his bewilderment when he watched. When Louis was ready, Hawk would become the stallion and they rode for another day.<br />
<br />
Neither of them suggested flying. Neither of them questioned where it was they were going or why. After a week, for the first time, the red hills looked closer. The next day, Louis suggested resting more often. There was a simple sort of comfort, riding together in the plains. Louis was in no hurry for it to end.<br />
<br />
On one day during their second week, Hawk interrupted their ride by veering wildly off course. Louis wondered why, before he saw what Hawk was heading towards. A herd of wild horses were galloping nearby and they did not object Hawk and Louis joining them. The lot of them thundered gleefully through the grass, with no concern for where they were headed.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Louis felt Hawk bucking beneath him. Not enough to dislodge him, but as if trying to communicate something. After two or three more, Louis understood. He cast his eyes around the galloping horses, then leant forward and pointed so that Hawk could see. <br />
<br />
Hawk slowed to pass behind two horses before sidling up alongside the one Louis had indicated. Another stallion, white and chestnut pinto. As they neared, Louis clutched the hilt of his sword, leapt from his steed and plunged his sword into his prey’s neck. With a ear-wrenching howl, both Louis and the pinto fell the ground. The other horses scattered, leaving just Hawk skidding to a halt on his hooves nearby. <br />
<br />
Louis stood. The stallion lay broken and twisted in its own quickly pooling blood. Louis felt a stab of guilt, before once again sensing the spirit of the creature he’d just killed. It looked at him, first with fear, then with reluctant acceptance and it dutifully walked over. Louis was hit by the smell of grass and the cool rushing wind and the wide open blue of the sky meeting the wide open brown of the grasslands. <br />
<br />
Hawk nuzzled his shoulder. Louis patted him. Then he began to undress. Hawk watched with interest as Louis folded his tunic and trousers and shoved them into his sack. He re-sheathed his sword, looped his sack through one of the belts of his scabbard and slung the whole thing loosely over his arms. It hung limply on his pale, naked body. Then he let his new catch loose.<br />
<br />
His body filled with strength. Not fiery like the dragon, nor thrilling like the orc, but of a steadfast, determined sort. His body stretched outwards across a larger frame and quickly filled out with muscle. A golden tail like maiden’s hair flicked out over his bulging rump. His hair paled to a similar gold, stretching out to cover his lengthening neck. The snout came with a snort and his member dropped with a swing. Hawk snickered at that. <br />
<br />
Dark splotches appeared on his pink skin, soon covered by white and chestnut fur. His fingers shrank while his fingernails grew, fusing into heavy, dark hooves. He leant forward onto four legs, strong, like the pillars of building, holding up his new weight. His sword and sack rested on his back, held in place by the now tight belts of his scabbard.<br />
<br />
Hawk, the dun stallion, approached, touching Louis with gentle sniffs. He was bigger than Louis, clearly taking a horse from a colder region, while Louis was the more sprightly build of a plains horse. Still, Hawk seemed impressed. As he inspected Louis, he playfully nipped between his hind legs. Louis snorted at him and Hawk trotted off, whinnying with glee.<br />
<br />
The days were different after that. Louis and Hawk galloped in tandem, weaving in and out of each other’s paths. No longer a burden, Louis didn’t worry if Hawk was tired, especially now he knew how fun it was to gallop. And that night, for the first time, Louis let Hawk mount him. Together, they brayed loudly into the empty night.<br />
<br />
The red hills loomed larger on the horizon. Louis had long since lost count of the days. Louis awoke, still a stallion from the night before. Hawk was already up, a stallion as well. Seeing Louis was awake, he picked up Louis’s sack in his teeth and sword and brought it over to him. <br />
<br />
Louis nuzzled it. His clothes were in there. His prize money from the Stonewater tournament. The curtain kilt for the orc. The sword, a gift from his brother. They had all seemed so important, but after having them bang against his back all day, every day, and never using them, they seemed more and more unnecessary. <br />
<br />
Louis got to his feet, snickered at Hawk and galloped off. Hawk soon overtook, whinnying with glee.</p>
