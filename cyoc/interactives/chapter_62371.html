<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Looking up above me, I noticed the club's name was "Full Moon" and I thought that 
was wonderfully fitting for the situation. Thinking about what could happen, I decided to 
make a wish really quick. Being outside, with all the chaos and commotion going on, I 
wished <em>if anyone touched me, they would turn into a werewolf as well, but slower 
and comes as a build up</em>. As I clutched my hand to the door, surprisingly there was 
no resistance, since I was sure there would be with the bouncer running in the way he did 
and the door opened smoothly for me. Suddenly, I heard someone call out to me and grasp 
my forearm, pulling me inside quickly and I saw that it was the bouncer who I was 
originally after. I thought to myself <em>Nice... he started the process for me! I can't wait 
to see what happens in here!</em> He quickly put a chain through the door handles, 
wrapping the chain around it a few times to get the maximum strength possible. It was 
clear that he wanted to keep the threat outside, but little did he know... he just became the 
threat.</br>
<br>"Man... you sure are lucky to have gotten in here when you did! It's crazy out there!" 
The big and burly bouncer said in his average manly voice, breathing slightly heavier while 
his look of concern changed to less concerned.</br>
<br>"Yeah... I guess I am!" I said, wondering what was going through his already changing 
mind.</br>
<br>I started looking around the club, but I couldn't see much because we were standing 
in the hallway with another set of closed doors, which was probably the main interior 
there. Looking around, taking in everything, I made several glances at the bouncer to see 
what I was dealing with. The guy was very rugged and beefy, just the type you'd think 
would be a bouncer. He had thick forearms covered in chestnut hair; his upper arms were 
a good twenty-five inches around; his neck was thickly muscled like the rest of him, which 
appeared to be like a tree trunk; his face was sporting a nice, thick and dark stubble. On 
my second pass, I noticed that his chest was just as thickly muscled, big, round and soft; 
his abdomen looked like a power lifter's, it was round, but not soft or jiggly; he had thighs 
like tree trunks as well; his calves were nice, big and coated in the same hair as his arms, 
going down from what was exposed of his thighs by wearing shorts down to his sock 
covered ankles. I knew that this guy could make one hell of a werewolf, since the other 
guys that turned grew more muscular than they were, if they were at all.</br>
<br>"By the way, the name is Mike. What's your name?" He asked, his voice was slightly 
deeper than before, which caused the big man to rub his throat.</br>
<br>"I'm Gary, it's nice to meet you Mike. So... what kind of club is Full Moon anyway?" I 
asked, curious since all I saw earlier were silhouettes of people in the windows.</br>
<br>"Nice to meet you too Gary. We typically cater to the gay male crowd of the town, like 
tonight. Some nights this place caters to both gays and straights." Mike said plainly as we 
approached the double doors.</br>
<br>"Oh..." I said, scratching my head, feeling a bit awkward.</br>
<br>Immediately Mike caught on to my apprehension. "Oh, you aren't gay are you? You 
just ran in here for some safety from whatever those things out there... huh?" Mike said, 
his facial expression changed from plain to sly as the wolf in him was probably starting to 
take over.</br>
<br>"Actually... I am, but up until recently, I never wanted to acknowledge it. Not to 
mention, I have never done anything sexual with a guy either." I said, feeling my face turn 
red hot, which Mike saw.</br>
<br>Mike smiled, which allowed me to see his normal I-teeth were now longer and 
sharper, coming to a nice and pointed tip. "Oh... well then you are in good company!" He 
said as he wrapped his massive arm around my shoulders.</br>
<br>"So are you gay or do you just work here?" I asked a bit hesitantly.</br>
<br>Mike stopped us both, turned and faced me, grinning from ear to ear which was 
already reshaping to have points at the tops. "Yeah, I am gay too and I am proud of who I 
am. You should be too!" He said in an disarming tone, then continued into the main 
club.</br>
<br>Inside it was quiet, unlike how it was several minutes ago, and the couple hundred 
patrons were all staring up at the flat, big screen television mounted on the back wall of 
the bar. On it was the local news, reporting on what was going on and the mischief that I 
started, the reporter was describing the beasts and she called them werewolves. I grinned 
inwardly, knowing that was exactly what they were. As I looked at Mike, I noticed that he 
was standing at a distance from the rest of the guys that had various builds in all different 
styles of clothes. Curious, I decided to approach him and refrain from touching any one 
else in there. I wanted to see what would happen with Mike and Mike alone... for 
now.</br>
<br>"Hey bud... what's going on?" I asked with concern in my voice, even though I knew 
what was happening.</br>
<br>"Oh... hey Gary... not too much really. I am feeling... different, that's all." Mike said 
with hesitation in his deeper voice.</br>
<br>As I looked at his head, things were definitely different about him already. His ears 
were more pointed, but not overly noticeably so; his face was coated in a thick half inch 
stubble now instead of having the shadow; his eyes were now more piercing, having 
changed from their natural baby blue to a more amber hue; his mouth was a bit more 
pronounced, almost as if it had already started developing a muzzle.</br>
<br>"Oh... well you look like you are doing pretty good. Do you want to go sit down or 
something?" I asked in a consoling voice, while touching his furry forearm.</br>
<br>I watched as his eyes lit up and he perked up like he felt miraculously better. "Yeah... I 
think that would be good. We can go to the employee lounge and if you want, I can lock 
the doors so just you and I can talk. I remember what you said earlier... that you have 
never done anything with a guy and I am curious to know why." Mike said with a toothy 
grin that looked more fang like now, being slightly thicker, longer and more 
pronounced.</br>
<br>I chuckled as we walked into the lounge, Mike stayed behind to lock the door while I 
sat on the big, black sofa against the back wall. As he approached me with some swagger 
in his steps, I could see the massive bulge that was forming in his pants. I could not help 
but to stare at the thing and he caught on, smiling a very wolfish smile.</br>
<br>"So... I guess you found something about me that you like... eh?" Mike said 
seductively.</br>
<br>"I... I like the whole package to be honest... not just the one between your legs." I said 
as I looked away from him.</br>
<br>Mike stood there, his bulge almost right in my face, then he dropped to his knees 
and moved in for a kiss. Mike moved in closer and closer slowly, while I reciprocated and 
our lips met. At first, it was just a single kiss that was short and sweet, but we both moved 
closer for another and another until we were passionately swapping saliva, our tongues 
swimming in the others' mouths. When we broke off, I sat there with my eyes closed and 
slack jawed. I could not believe how amazing that was and when I opened my eyes, I saw 
Mike grinning. It wasn't the Mike I had been talking to earlier, more the wolfish Mike that 
was coming to be. His ears were definitely pointed now; his fangs were breaking the seal of 
his lips; his face had slightly pushed out into a muzzle; his nose was slightly flattened like 
a wolf's; his muscles were bigger and causing the fabric to not only constrict around his 
massive muscles, but show them off considerably more; his body hair was thicker almost 
to the point of being fur, but not quite; his nails were black and began forming his claws. I 
couldn't help but to smile from seeing his slow progression into a werewolf. Mike smiled 
back, thinking mine was from the kiss... which it was, well... at least part of it was 
anyway.</br>
<br>"So why have you never been with another guy... till now that is?" Mike said slyly, his 
massive hand that was slowly turning into a paw rested on the inner portion of my thigh 
while innocently brushing up against my raging bulge.</br>
<br>"I never really found a guy I wanted until now." I said, blushing a lot more now.</br>
<br>"Oh... so you really do like me then eh?" Mike said, standing back up onto his feet, 
which I could see were straining against his boots, his feet were more than likely as far 
along into paws as his hands were.</br>
<br>He grinned at me, then grasped the base of his shirt, then pulled it up and over his 
head, exposing his awesome torso. Mike's lats flared as he struggled to pull the fabric over 
his head; his abdomen was slightly round, not cut, but as hard as a rock; his pecs were like 
huge fluffy pillows you would love to just rest your head on for the entire day if you could... 
all of which was covered in the same thickness of hair as his arms, legs and face were... 
and I thought it was sexy as hell. Once his shirt was off, he grinned down at me.</br>
<br>"Go ahead Gary... I know you want to touch my bulge... I have seen the way you have 
looked at it thus far." He said wryly.</br>
<br>I smiled while blushing more as he got closer so that his bulge was right in my face. I 
reached up, placing both my hands on it as he moaned softly, feeling incredible pleasure 
from my touch. Inwardly I made a quick wish that his cock and anyone else's that was 
transformed in this building would remain human in shape. The red rocket was intriguing, 
but it felt just a little too weird for me. As I grasped his raging bulge, my eyes widened 
feeling how thick it was. It felt like it had to be as thick as a can of soda... or bigger. Now it 
had me curious and I had to see it for myself.</br>
<br>”Aww yeah man… fuck, take that big monster out! He is waiting for your special 
touch.” Mike said, moaning while slightly growling.</br>
<br>I smiled seeing how much more he got into what we were doing. It was definitely 
exciting for me as well, especially seeing how much more he changed with my touch. 
Curious about how big he really was, I grabbed the zipper and yanked it down a few times. 
Immediately, some tension was released as his cock head pushed against the fabric and 
poked out some through the zipper hole. From what I could even see with the fabric still 
covering it, the head appeared to be slightly smaller than the width of the hole, but I was 
sure that would be changing too. All I heard were growls coming from his vocal chords 
and it made me want to see him in full werewolf form that much more.</br>
<br>”Aww fuck yeah, now take him out! He wants to see you and I’m sure you want to see 
him too!” Mike said, grinning his more wolfish grin, his face pushing further out into a 
lupine muzzle, but not completely.</br>
<br>Wondering what would happen if I told him what he was becoming, I grinned and 
decided to see for myself, not adding to the wish. “H… hey Mike… it looks like you got 
whatever made those people turn into beasts out there!” I said, trying to sound scared 
when I wasn’t.</br>
<br>Mike paused for a second, looking at all of his physical changes, and grinned even 
more. “Fuck… no wonder why I have been feeling more aroused than I ever have been thus 
far! This is and feels amazing… now why don’t you be a good pup and release me. I want 
to make you <strong>my</strong> pup Gary… would you like that?” Mike said in almost 
a full growl, placing his thick paws behind the back of my head as I felt the tips of his new 
claws rest gently on my skull, pushing me forward for my lips to rest on the tip of his thick 
head, feeling the moisture from his pre touch my lips.</br>
<br>A thousand thoughts were running through my mind at that moment. It was an 
intriguing offer, to actually belong to someone, not to mention a new werewolf that wanted 
me to be like him. I had to think this over for and after a moment I decided…</br></p>
