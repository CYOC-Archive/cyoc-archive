<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You're going to be re-instituted into society as a police officer.&quot; said the guard.<br />
&quot;No! You can't make me!&quot; shouted Alvin, clearly protesting, &quot;I can't join the ranks of those pigs! I won't do it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Like it was discussed before, you do not have a say in the matter.&quot; said the other guard to Alvin, &quot;You will cooperate, and if you don't you'll simply be made to.&quot;<br />
&quot;This isn't fair!&quot; exclaimed Alvin.<br />
&quot;Neither is life, buddy. Now come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two guards removed Alvin from his cell, and walked him to the hospital ward of the detention center he was in. The room was eerily quiet, being almost empty, with the exception of a few doctors and surgeons in the room. Alvin glared at everyone who would look his way. The stares at him were like ice, people were unsure of how to look at him, with his expression so hateful.<br />
The guards walked him up to a surgery table, and lifted him up on to it. They strapped him to it, to ensure that he wouldn't be able to escape. Alvin struggled, but he proved to be no match for the two burly security guards. Resigned to his fate once he was strapped up, he sighed, &quot;Guess there's no glory in this world.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the doctors turned to him and said, &quot;There's plenty of glory in this world. We're giving you a chance to see it.&quot;<br />
Alvin simply grimaced, and that made the doctor quickly change the subject to a more formal one, &quot;We're going to anesthetize you now, Alvin.&quot;<br />
Alvin saw the mask go over his face, and soon he was out like a light.<br />
<br />
Alvin was next aware of himself in a dream like state. He was lying in a bed not his own in a strange room that he'd never seen before. He seemed sort of aware of what was going on, but he also had an air of confusion to him. An alarm clock went off behind him, and he turned it off. It was morning, time to get dressed and get ready for his day.<br />
<br />
Naked, Alvin got out of bed naked and went to the bathroom, which he knew was down the hall from the bedroom he was in. He looked in the mirror to see a teenage face. He looked young, bright-eyed, with no facial hair to speak of. He did look a bit tired, but it was early in the morning and that was to be expected. Alvin grabbed shaving cream and a razor out of a drawer and started running the tap with hot water. He wet his face, and then put the cream all over his clean shaved face, with the exception of above his upper lip. He then took the razor and shaved off the cream, with ease. After he was done he reached back into the drawer and pulled out aftershave, applying it to his skin. He stopped a moment to admire how he looked in the mirror. He took his fingers and rubbed it across his upper lip. Where previously there had been nothing, Alvin felt the bristles of a small mustache beginning to grow.<br />
<br />
From the bathroom Alvin stumbled back into the bedroom and went into the drawers. He picked out a pair of white briefs and a pair of grey socks, and put them on. He then grabbed a pair of nicely pressed, wrinkle free black pants from the drawer which he knew contained pants for some reason and put them on, careful not to make any wrinkles in them. He went into the closet and grabbed one of his black uniform shirts and put it on, careful to not get any wrinkles in that either. He then grabbed a dark blue tie and put it around his neck. Off the nightstand, he grabbed the pin which said &quot;A. ROBB&quot; on it and police badge, and put them on his shirt, to signify authority, though the message didn't convey well because the clothes were all too big for Alvin, he looked like a kid in his dad's clothes.<br />
<br />
He then realized that it was about time for breakfast. Alvin walked down the hall and down a set of stairs to what appeared to be a kitchen. He turned on his coffeemaker and started brewing a cup of coffee. He opened the box on the counter to find donuts. His stomach growled furiously, he was craving these donuts. He reached into the box and grabbed a donut, and took a bite. The donut was made of chocolate, and then dipped in chocolate. He savored the flavor of it in his mouth as the taste danced around, making him happy. He ate the donut until it was gone, but he still felt emptiness in his stomach. He reached into the box and pulled out another donut, this one strawberry dipped. He ate that one, and then decided he would have one more, a coconut chocolate donut. After eating all three donuts, the empty stomach feeling subsided, in favor of a pang in his brain that could be only be explained as a caffeine requirement.<br />
<br />
Alvin grabbed a mug out from one of the hanging drawers, and poured it about three quarters full of the black coffee that was now made from the coffeemaker. He reached into the fridge, and grabbed milk, pouring some into his coffee. After he put the milk back Alvin sipped from the mug, and grimaced. He had forgotten a key element of the coffee, sugar. Alvin grabbed the sugar and a teaspoon, and put two teaspoon fulls of sugar into his coffee, stirring it afterwards. Alvin then sipped the coffee again, and smiled at the result. Nothing beat a good cup of Joe in the morning. Alvin patted his gut, and almost reacting to it, his body started morphing slightly to accommodate for the food he has eaten. Alvin started stretching in height, provably a couple inches or two, as his body parts grew in proportion. He gained some muscle mass, as well as some fat in areas, notably his gut. The clothes he was wearing were still a bit large, but they looked like they had fit better than they did before.<br />
<br />
Alvin finished his coffee and knew it was time to leave for work now. He grabbed the police hat and put it on his head as he was out the door. In the driveway, he spotted a police car, and walked up to it. He put the key in it's lock and turned it to open up the car. He looked in the mirror, and smiled. He rubbed his fingers through his mustache, and then adjusted the mirror for proper driving protocol. He put his foot on the brake, and then put the key in and turned it on. Suddenly, the intercom in the car went off. &quot;Officer Robb, do you copy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Loud and clear, Chief McGrady.&quot; replied Alvin. His voice was lower than it was before. Not quite deep as a mans, but it definitely didn't sound like a teenager anymore.<br />
&quot;We have an armed robbery at 23rd and Park. Get on the scene, you're needed there.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm on it chief.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alvin turned on his sirens, and started driving the car to his destination. The ride there was pretty short, Alvin seemed to know all the directions to the location. Upon approaching the premises, Officer Robb ran immediately into the store which was being robbed. A young hoodlum was aiming a gun at an employee, who had their hands up. Alvin grabbed his gun off of his belt and aimed it at the kid. &quot;Police! Cease and Desist threat immediately!&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid panicked, and dropped the gun, putting his hands in the air. Officer Robb seized the moment, running towards the kid. As he ran, he started to grow again, filling out the rest of his uniform. His face started to age, becoming somewhat more weathered and losing it's youthful sheen. His mustache hairs thickened and grew in length, until he had a stereotypical cop mustache across his upper lip. His body filled out with muscle and fat, until his uniform fit him well, not being loose anymore. Officer Robb tackled the kid, and put handcuffs on his hands, behind his back.<br />
<br />
As Officer Robb was walking the kid back to his police car, he asked the kid what his name was.<br />
&quot;My name? Why do you want my name, you pig?&quot;<br />
&quot;Please don't disrespect my authority, you broke the law. Now what's your name.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmph, I'm Alvin Robb.&quot;<br />
Suddenly, the world went dark.<br />
<br />
Officer Alvin Robb woke up in his bed naked to an alarm clock. He sighed, &quot;I just had the strangest dream. Arresting myself?&quot;<br />
His voice was deep and masculine, he sounded like a tough man that nobody would ever want to mess with. It certainly helped him out in his day to day job.<br />
He got out of bed and walked to the bathroom, getting ready for his daily shave. He rubbed his fingers across his mustache and smiled.</p>
