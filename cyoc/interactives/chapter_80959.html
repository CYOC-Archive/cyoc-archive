<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay thought it through before saying to his twin &quot;Nah, we don't have the time. We're already running late as <br />
it is, and now that gramps is teaching us how to run the shop, dad needs all the help he can get. Maybe we can <br />
come back during our break or something if we really want to change things&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess you're right&quot; Mark replied. &quot;Let me just brush my teeth and we'll get going&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jay was suspicious of Mark, but said with a bit of hesitation &quot;OK, but if you're not in the car within 5 <br />
minutes, you're going to have to walk&quot;. Mark gave a short laugh, knowing that the last time Jay said that, he <br />
went through with his word, and it'd taken him an hour to reach the shop on foot. But given how he'd noticed <br />
small choices can have immediate consequences, maybe a long walk would keep the hereditary gut away for the <br />
time being.<br />
<br />
Of course, instead of brushing his teeth, which he'd done before breakfast as always, Mark once again started <br />
up the Chronivac. He still felt like the time acceleration was too slow. He may have aged an extra 3 years <br />
overnight, but it didn't feel like enough. Remembering where the temporal flow section was, he thought about <br />
how to change it. At the moment, it said &quot;1 DAY = 10 YEARS&quot;, or one year for every 2 hours 26 minutes. It was <br />
about to turn 9 o' clock now, which meant he was now 25 years old. Thinking about it, he knew exactly what to <br />
do. Adjusting the sliders, the display now read &quot;1 HOUR = 1 YEAR&quot;. That would make him and his brother 40, his <br />
dad 60, and his granddad 80 by the end of the day. It was an extreme change, but he was ready for it, and as <br />
long as he remembered to stop it by the end of the day, he wouldn't have to worry about everyone getting too <br />
old. He checked the advanced options again to make sure they'd stuck, then clicked enter. The now familiar <br />
&quot;INITIALISING RIPPLE EFFECT. PLEASE WAIT...&quot; message appeared as he felt the wave of energy burst from the <br />
device. Glancing out the window, he could see his brother was still there. A quick swish of mouthwash should <br />
fool him.<br />
<br />
Jay was still waiting for Mark to come out of the house, making note of when he got into the car. It didn't <br />
take this long to brush your teeth, and 4 minutes into his countdown, he felt an all too familiar weird <br />
feeling. He looked back to the house and saw his brother peek his head through the window in his dad's room. <br />
The sneaky bastard! He knew he would do something, and he was right. But whatever he changed, he didn't seem <br />
to notice anything different. His phone buzzed, signalling his 5 minute limit. He started up the car, just <br />
about to turn out when Mark opened the front door, waving at him. Jay rolled down the window and shouted out <br />
to him &quot;Too late!&quot; and drove off to the shop. It serves him right, ignoring his job to tamper with reality. <br />
Just a bit of self-inflicted karma. Chuckling about his justice, he didn't notice his belly expand further <br />
with a gurgle.<br />
<br />
Mark swore to himself as his brother drove off without him. Now he'd have to walk again. It was bad enough the <br />
first time. If he doesn't get lost like the first time he tried, he could be at the shop within the hour. He <br />
felt a bit winded at first, he hadn't done this in a while now, but the further he walked, the better he got. <br />
About halfway through, he started to jog. A new memory appeared in his head of always jogging to the shop <br />
instead of getting a lift with his brother so he could keep trim. At least he now knew the route, having taken <br />
it countless times now. The little curve on his stomach that appeared at breakfast was quickly disappearing, <br />
being replaced by toned muscle. In fact, his whole body was getting more toned. He was the one who did most of <br />
the heavy lifting in the shop, now having the body for it, somehow missing the fat storing genes the rest of <br />
his family had. His clothes had changed from his bulky work clothes into running gear. He kept his jumpsuit at <br />
the garage so he could change into it there. Sweat was dripping down his face and into his beard which had <br />
grown more wild and bushy,  now longer than the length of his dad's and granddad's facial hair combined. It <br />
seemed to compensate for the hair that had disappeared from his head, which was now completely clean shaven <br />
like Simon's, a sweatband wrapped around the dome to stop further sweat from soaking his face. Checking his <br />
watch once he had the building in his sights, he had made it in half an hour, slower than normal but he did <br />
start off walking at first. Mark stopped just outside, waiting to catch his breath before entering. Simon was <br />
in the back, attending to a broken engine, while Bryan sat off to the side, coaching Jay on something he <br />
couldn't hear. Jay's stomach had swollen a lot bigger, looking bigger in size than their dad now. Unlike Mark, <br />
Jay hadn't shaved his head at all, seemingly proud of his hair loss because it showed just how manly he was, <br />
or at least how high in testosterone he was compared to his peers. He kept it at a noticeable length, a 2 inch <br />
wide strip of hair separated his hairline from the large bald spot at the back. There was no way of guessing <br />
these two men were twins. Brothers definitely, but not twins. Mark greeted his family and went inside to <br />
change.<br />
<br />
Jay saw Mark enter the garage and say hello to everyone before heading out to the break room. How did he get <br />
here so fast? He'd left him in the dust at home after he'd passed the 5 minute limit for a lift, and yet he'd <br />
arrived, in gymwear no less. Wait, did he offer him a lift? Mark hadn't come to the garage by car in years, <br />
preferring to jog the distance instead. Thinking about it, he did offer him a ride because they were running <br />
late, but he refused it as usual. But something still felt wrong. Did Mark always have that huge beard and <br />
shaved head combo? It was certainly different to his sculpted goatee and severe balding combo. It was like he <br />
didn't want to look like his twin any more. He sighed and got back to following his grandfather's <br />
instructions, the old man having retired, too tired to help about the store any more, and was passing on his <br />
expert knowledge to his grandsons.<br />
<br />
Mark entered the break room and stripped out of his gymwear and stood in his underwear. His body hair had <br />
grown even thicker now, wrapping around his body like a shirt of its own. he scratched at it, letting the <br />
sweat sticking to it cool him down. Digging through the wardrobes, he found his jumpsuit, the smallest size <br />
there, and put it on. Looking in the mirror, he marvelled at his changes. That jog definitely helped him, <br />
looking thinner than he had in years. If only he could convince the rest of them to join him, but they were <br />
quite content being overweight. He was able to stand the friendly jabs at his body from them. He ran a hand <br />
over his smooth head, no sign of any stubble at all. He remembered shaving it off one drunk night and thought <br />
he looked better without hair than trying to clasp onto it. So to compensate for this change, he also stopped <br />
trimming his beard, letting it grow longer to replace the hair he'd lost. He'd only recently noticed a few <br />
grey hairs were creeping into his beard. He was definitely enjoying himself here. He looked up at the clock, <br />
seeing that it now turned 10 o' clock. That meant he was now 26 years old. It was going to be a long day.</p>
