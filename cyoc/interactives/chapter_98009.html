<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The courthouse wasn&#39;t super impressive when compared many buildings William remembered seeing in Minnesota, but it did look rather well.  It was attached to City Hall in forming a long stone basilica with a small dome sitting over the courthouse side of the building. Much of it also carried the look that the main original structure was built in the 1800s but had been periodically upgraded to make up for advances in technology. A part of him wondered if that meant that Melissa Stovall had her work cut out for her with regard to tech support, but then with Moon Lake&#39;s attempt to be a &quot;hidden&quot; sanctuary for were-beasts that a lot of the upgrades that many other cities had gone through wasn&#39;t going to be something easily done due to the fact that building a more modern building could potentially mean having a lot of contractors come into Moon Lake over a potentially long period of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no Imperial Palace but it has served its purpose well,&quot; came a voice from the side and mad William look over.<br />
<br />
He turned to see Akane Tachibana walking calmly toward him and the college Dean. Walking slowly behind her were two new werefoxes, or at least new to William. One was a male with light brown/dark blond hair and the other was a female with sandy blond hair. To top this off, he recognized both of them as students of his. They had his class during the same period that he had Yvette in. The two of them seemed inseparable and always sat together, but generally did do well in providing to the class discussion. They seemed just as surprised at seeing him and likely knowing that he was a werefox as he was seeing them as werefoxes. He also noticed that Jenny was trying hard to get her clothing to fit her new body better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Anderson?!&quot; Jenny came forward, &quot;You&#39;re a werefox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am now,&quot; William answered, &quot;Yvette clawed and tried to rape this past Thursday afternoon on my way home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two know each other?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have them in my classes,&quot; William answered, &quot;Yvette clawed the two of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She only clawed me,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;I am actually the one who transformed Harry... who&#39;s proposed to marry me, and I have accepted his proposal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; William said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny and Harry both said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully this business can be handled quickly and Jenny&#39;s transformation can be completed with as few complications as possible,&quot; Akane spoke.<br />
<br />
William nodded, as that was why they were there. It was the Dean, however, who spoke as he came around to join the others on the sidewalk. His approach actually further startled Jenny, probably as she was still adapting to the enhanced senses she&#39;d gained as a were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amen to that,&quot; the Dean commented, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ms. Harper, for all you&#39;ve been put through. I&#39;ve done a lot to protect the college&#39;s students and staff... and while this isn&#39;t the first time a student has had an interest in a teacher... this IS the first time one has gone as far as she has. I could and should have done more to protect you and Mr. Anderson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... uh... Mrs. Twist said all werecats are female...&quot; Jenny gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;All werecats that are based off of the domestic house cat are female, yes,&quot; the Dean answered, &quot;but while my were-species is feline, it is considerably larger. I am a weretiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Jenny said weakly, &quot;It&#39;s just that all these scents and sounds... it&#39;s still overwhelming...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Dean nodded, &quot;I went through the same thing when I first changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded and drifted into Harry&#39;s arms for the moment. There was a lot that she was adapting to, and William understood that, as there was a lot that he had been adapting to. And while he could tell he was adapting fast, he still had to admit that there was a lot to adapt to.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had best go inside,&quot; Akane urged, &quot;the hearing will begin soon and completing Ms. Harper&#39;s transformation should be managed as quickly as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
William and the Dean both bowed in respect and agreement with the Skulk leader&#39;s comment. With that Akane began to lead a short procession toward the doors to the courthouse side of the building while the Dean, William, Jenny, and Harry fell in behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... when do you two plan to get married?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;On Halloween,&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;my parents were always very strict and it may be best to provide evidence and proof that I am married before springing on them that I plan to live here with Harry and not go back to Alabama.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you thought on what you&#39;re going to say to them about your form?&quot; William asked, &quot;becoming a were... it does lead to a lot of physical changes that are even there in human form. Will your parents adapt well to that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I haven&#39;t given thought to,&quot; Jenny answered and then paused for a moment, &quot;maybe I will... I mean it&#39;s not like I can tell them I&#39;m getting married and living here all my life. My parents were strict but they weren&#39;t complete monsters. They will want to come for the wedding... if only to make sure Harry meets their standards... and it&#39;s not like I can&#39;t just disappear into the wilderness with him here... and there will be a couple new things about me they&#39;ll notice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... just be careful though,&quot; William told her, &quot;if you don&#39;t think they&#39;ll react well to being a were... it may not be a good idea to tell them that. They may react better to cosmetic surgery than being a were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;d take either well...&quot; Jenny said slowly, &quot;but right now... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take one day at a time,&quot; William told them, &quot;and you&#39;ll do fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded as they went in. The Dean actually held the door open for all of them. They entered to find a more modern interior than what the outside looked. William had expected the floors to be wooden, polished perhaps, but wooden nonetheless. To his surprise though, the floor of the entryway was actually polished tile in a very artistic mosaic. It showed the image of a churchman surrounded by many different animals that seemed to be looking at the Churchman reverently. There were also two wooden and stone stairs that went in a circular curve around the edges of the room toward a second level in the courthouse portion of the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a mosaic of Saint Francis of Assisi,&quot; came Samantha&#39;s voice from in front of them, &quot;the patron Saint of Animals... and since we were-beasts are very much in touch with our animal sides we&#39;ve tended to identify with him as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all looked to see Samantha Twist standing there in some more formal clothing than what William expected. He expected some similar attire to what Martha wore she taught, but he clothing was more formal than that. She wore a knee length skirt with a black belt. The belt was barely visible under her business suit jacket that covered her blouse. A green jeweled cat&#39;s head brooch sat at the collar of her blouse to hold it closed. Beside her was a bookish looking man with a briefcase, but unlike the collection of weres there, this man was human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Samantha moved to introduce the man, &quot;this our local DA Simon Theropod. He will be running the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of my parents&#39; families moved to Moon Lake and they become weres as their other family members did,&quot; Simon Theropod answered, &quot;they met and got married and had me... and as I&#39;ve grown up here... there is much to be appreciated in were society, especially with their efforts to police themselves. Something that people outside Moon Lake don&#39;t know or understand... and as such, I&#39;ve done my best to make sure that there is justice here. To pay back the town that has been kind to me and my family where weres and normals can and HAVE lived together in peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all nodded in response. And it did make sense to William. While most of the population of Moon Lake were weres, there were those that were normal. He also remembered either Samantha or the Dean telling him that the normals that had grown up in Moon Lake knew all about their were-beast neighbors but had been raised in a way that didn&#39;t treat them as monsters but as neighbors and even friends. Simon Theropod had to fit into that category.<br />
<br />
&quot;And today should only be a brief introduction to the case, to state the charges, get Yvette Smith&#39;s plea, and opening statements,&quot; Simon continued, &quot;we&#39;d also normally set bail... but given that the vixen has already proven willing to escape custody once... I will be making a motion that bail be denied on the basis of her being a flight risk and potential threat to Moon Lake&#39;s community... or at least that the bail be so absurdly high that there is no way she could pay it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She will also be needed to complete Jennifer Harper&#39;s transformation,&quot; Akane spoke up, &quot;that is important and is the Skulk&#39;s wish that it may be achieved as quickly as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon nodded, &quot;That can be arranged, though, you&#39;ll need to talk with the police when the hearing is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be needing us for today?&quot; the Dean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I probably won&#39;t need actual testimony from you today,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;and I would think our case is very strong... but I would like to have you there for when the opening statements are made to provide the jury with some sense of impact that this particular rogue had... not just in changing two normals against their will but in shaming the college that brings the people to Moon Lake, if only briefly, the honor of the Skulk and the werefox community in Moon Lake, and disrupted the families of normals who are trying to abide by the town&#39;s laws. Once we get to the main part of the trail and we&#39;re actually talking to witnesses... we may require more... but for now you are all that is needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the Dean answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... we have a little time... but hearing will begin soon,&quot; Simon said slowly, &quot;best to be on our way.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that he began to move on his way toward one of the staircases and the others moved to follow him. However, Samantha took a path that would take her right up to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you holding up?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nervous,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;scared that I&#39;ll be face to face with the one who did this to me... the one I WANT no part of... yet NEED just to complete everything as everyone keeps saying. And scared that I could go nuts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed as this had to relate to the length of time that Jenny had gone without having her transformation completed. The threats were real and serious, and while they could be healed, that didn&#39;t diminish the problems they could cause. She immediately began riffling through her purse for a moment and pulled out a small business card and offered it to Jenny. Jenny took it and read the label. It read: &quot;Moon Lake Psychiatric Clinic, Frances Twist, MD, DO&quot; and then followed with Frances&#39; business number.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought your name was Samantha?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;this is my wife&#39;s card. If you ever need someone to talk to besides Harry about all of this... or if you do need therapy to heal what Yvette Smith has done to you. Call her. She can help you. I won&#39;t lie and say that the threats aren&#39;t real... but with the right effort, attention, and care... the damage can bee healed. And she can help you if you decide you want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny answered.</p>
