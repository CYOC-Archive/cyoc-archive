<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yu paws through the things piled on his night stand to find his cell phone.  He had to call Lydia.  There was something wrong going on and he knew she would have an answer.  Papers and piles of junk spilled onto the floor as he searched.  His phone was not where he normally put it.  Still completely naked, Yu took special care to make sure his door was locked as he searched.  Finding the phone was more important than getting dressed at the moment.  It has to be somewhere in here, he thought.<br />
<br />
Yu searched under his bed and in the rumpled sheets for it.  All the while his mind raced.  Why was this happening to him?  Did some of the magic rub off from Lydia?  That did not seem likely.  It was difficult to place logical limits on magic but somehow he did not feel that what had become of Lydia was likely to drift to others.<br />
<br />
But it was magic was it not?  Yu stopped for a moment to consider himself in the mirror.  His body was still the toned if not muscular body of a high-school hipster.  His hair was the same if a bit rumpled.  The only thing out of place was his privates.  For a moment his hand stroked the spandex shaft enjoying the feeling of the smooth fabric under his hand.  It reminded him of how Lydia felt when she squirmed under his body.  He thought about how much he enjoyed making his mermaid squirm with pleasure.<br />
<br />
The green spandex grew further at that moment pulling him from idleness.  It fabric spread a little.  One bit pushed between his legs while the top part spread across his pelvis.  The motion of the spandex was smooth and fluid.  Yu could see the edge move but could not really feel his skin changing.  Clearly his situation was getting worse.  He needed to find his phone and it was not in his room.<br />
<br />
Yu tossed on a cream and dark-brown bowling shirt.  For pants he decided on jeans and it was not until after he had made his way downstairs that he realized he had forgotten underwear.  His erection was folded flat as best he could manage inside his pants and the spandex patch slide about under his clothing.  It felt weird but nice, which was distracting.<br />
<br />
Yu passed pleasantries with his mother and brother who were at the table cleaning up the breakfast dishes.  He trundled about the house looking for the heavy, plastic device that would give him some answer.  He looked through the basement where he had sat with a naked mermaid discussing the future of a life with magic.<br />
<br />
Lydia had told him that she wanted to keep the tail so long as she could control it.  Yu had wanted her to keep the tail so long as he was the one that could hold her.  They had all but declared their love and devotion to each other last night.  Her transformation was large secret that they were going to keep, together.  And since the lamp would not work for either of them they would have to keep it for as long as they were together.<br />
<br />
The lamp did not work for him, he corrected his thoughts.  When he had touched the lamp and tried to force the genie out it had stung him.  The message was clear, there was only one wish per person.  He had used his to almost ruin his girlfriend's life.  There was no more magic to be had from the lamp.  That was why it disappeared from whomever used the lamp.  They could not use it anymore.  It had been a twist of fate that he had been able to obtain the lamp one more time.  Yu thought that once you used the lamp it was gone for good.  So why had it come back to him?<br />
<br />
The phone was not in the basement.  The only place he could remember it being was in his car.  Yu trudged his way outside.  No one else knew about the lamp besides Lydia and himself.  Maybe that old man at the swap meet, but why would that guy have done this to Yu.  Someone could have used the lamp after it disappeared from the basement but why would they have picked on Yu?  And the lamp only left after it was used not before.  The car was warm and stuffy already.  It was going to be a hot day.<br />
<br />
As he looked in all the tight spots for the phone, Yu continued to think.  Something was just not adding up in his mind.  It was silly that his erection was still going strong.  He was doing nothing to maintain it but it continued to strain under his jeans.  Absentmindedly he brushed it through his pants with a hand while he thought of Lydia.  He wondered if she would freak out when he called her.  Or would she coo in an interest way?  Spandex on spandex sex might be exciting.  Once again he felt a tugging on his penis.  It seemed to want to turn him around and he let it.  Wondering why it pointed him this direction he realized a moment later that that was the way he would go to get to Lydia's house.  There was another ghostly tug on his dick as if to drive the point home.  His dick was bound for Lydia's place.  It even had her name on it.<br />
<br />
Yu slapped his head with a hand a moment later.  How could he have been so stupid.  Lydia had made a wish.  She had done something to him and had purposely lied to him last night.  The lamp was gone for good now.  Gone because it had come back not so he could fix Lydia.  It came back so that Lydia could fix him.  What had she done?  Was this change going to be permanent or temporary?  After all they had talked about the night before she had gone and done this to him.  She played with magic even though she knew most of all what it was like to be changed without consent.  Maybe that had been her desire.<br />
<br />
The only way to know for sure was to talk to her.  As he walked back to the house empty handed he toyed with the idea of using the house hone in the living room.  Talking aloud with people walking around was not going to happen.  He could try to catch her online but the computer was also in a public space.  He needed his phone.<br />
<br />
Back in his room, Yu took off his pants to get a good look at the changes Lydia had wrought so far.  The spandex had spread once more and was now a tight band around his ass checks.  It was like he was wearing flawless hot-pant cut underwear with a built in penis sheath.  For a moment he admired the way the deep-green shined in the light before he noticed that his ass seemed more muscular.  It clenched tightly and stuck out like the kind of ass he imagined Lydia would like.  If it was not attached to him Yu would have thought it belonged to someone much sexier than himself.<br />
<br />
Then there was the sudden rush of pleasure.  It came suddenly, running up his penis and striking at his stomach.  His hips trust once with his abs clenching.  His erection speared forward almost out of his control.  The parts of him that were spandex seemed to tingle in the aftermath of the pleasure.  It was like a tiny orgasm had touched his fabric coated body.  It was intense and he wondered what had caused it.<br />
<br />
Yu's phone rang then.  He followed the noise and found it in the waste bin of all places just as it stopped ringing.  For a moment he had thought it was Lydia calling to gloat over his transformation.  The number read as some telemarketer and he was glad that he had missed the call.  Finally, Yu was able to call Lydia and get some answers.  But he felt that he already knew them all.<br />
<br />
All but one; when was this transformation going to end?</p>
