<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: Sorry, just this once, I'm writing a short chapter. And please guys, Unknown, S1, and <br />
others, don't wait on me to write a new chapter. And Loony, I can tell you're trying, you <br />
really are.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Marie sat down, it didn't feel right standing at this point and her growing audience, all of <br />
them transfixed, all of them entranced by the revelation she was telling. Of how three little <br />
girls had turned into the most horrid black hearted monsters that Glendale had ever seen. <br />
<br />
The white gallery wolf Betty sat by her nephew the muscle bound Lawrence. <br />
<br />
The twins Cassandra and Lilly of course sitting in the lap of their two headed father <br />
Maddex, his two third eyes on Marie while his remaining eyes on the children he had <br />
missed hugging while a simple shadow, his extra set of arms not ceasing to hug them. <br />
<br />
And now of course, Samantha, in her white dress with blue apron, five year old, just like <br />
Marie was now. Marie had been created to be a replacement of the monster Kurse had <br />
made Samantha into for a short time. However, Marie didn't pass for a perfect twin, her <br />
blond fur had a metallic shine to it, and her blue eyes reminded Samantha of the color of <br />
glass. <br />
<br />
All of them dressed in Victorian era clothes (included Maddex that were perfectly tailored <br />
for his extra parts), they listened to Marie's voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Golgatha who would was at the time known as Goldwyn was with the cat who'd become <br />
their familiar familiar, Princess whose real secret name was Herodias. She left her sisters <br />
both by blood and in spirit to watch over the small little girl statue of Joella  and her broken <br />
mind inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they really made it inside the wolf pack territory?&quot; Maddex asked surprised at the idea <br />
that -anyone- could successfully trespass on the Big Bad Wolves' land. <br />
<br />
Like any child of European descent in modern American time, Samantha had not been <br />
shielded by any and all sins committed by her long dead ancestors, &quot;Weren't the wolves <br />
back then really big and really bad?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Much more so in Europe.&quot; Marie said, &quot;The Big Bad Wolf Pack in America like any colonial <br />
population was made up of people that were either politically or socially unwanted. The <br />
members who made up the Big Bad Wolf Pack in Glendale in those days while by modern <br />
standards were militaristic and almost -savages-. During the day's standards they were <br />
radical thinkers compared to the European branch of the Big Bad Wolf Pack: which is why <br />
the rest of their pack dumped them on a boat in the first place...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know all that?&quot; Beatrice asked the five year old. <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you before, I am Kurse as she perceived herself, I have the understanding and clarity <br />
she -thought- she had after the three had gone mad from exposure to the Infinite Chaos <br />
directly. As such I have their memories and experiences. But since I am how they THOUGHT <br />
of themselves, that means I can see their acts of destruction for what it was and not for <br />
what they thought of it as.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Beatrice said at once looking at this small child cursed to know such evil.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So am I.&quot; Glass Marie said. &quot;Goldwyn was shielded from any member of the wolf pack <br />
seeing her and thinking 'intruder' or any hearing her steps and thinking 'someone's here <br />
that doesn't belong' or smelling her and thinking 'human is nearby.' This pushed Princess' <br />
ingrained abilities to their limit. Goldwyn unlike thieves and poachers marched straight <br />
onto their land with no fear, having little idea just what the wolf pack would do if caught in <br />
a hunting lust and smelled a human or leoman who was where they didn't belong. ... <br />
Princess at the end of the day, while trying to encourage the future where the three <br />
witchlings became anarchists, was very VERY loyal to Goldwyn and her sisters.  She showed <br />
her a stone alcove formed naturally out of the rock, on land that hadn't been cleared for <br />
farming on the pack's estate. It was a perfect spot to hide Joella in her statue form until <br />
the three achieved the level of power they needed to free her of her catatonic state.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And did they?&quot; Lilly asked.<br />
<br />
Marie said, &quot;It took an entire day to drag the statue Joella to the hiding spot they had <br />
chosen. Joella herself was thinking, when she was able to think or care, they were <br />
abandoning her. Of course with Goldwyn missing for an entire day, Running-Bear was <br />
beginning to get very suspicious, and no amount of magic would keep his -common <br />
sense- from ultimately putting two and two together, all he'd ultimately need was one tiny <br />
clue to realize the truth of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly corrected, &quot;I meant did they fix Joella's mind and make her alive again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie said as if she hadn't even heard Lilly, &quot;Of course this left princess divided between <br />
courting of males, narrowing the familiar candidates, and serving her mistress. And that's <br />
not counting when she'd have her first little that very next year. Spreading herself thin to <br />
keep Running-Bear from noticing her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Joella?&quot; Lilly repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once she was 'safe and sound' the girls began to double, then triple their efforts of <br />
becoming more powerful and 'helping others' to test out and practice with that power. <br />
Many things that were myths and legends before became reality thanks to the three of <br />
them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I meant! Did they fix Joella and make her a real girl again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;At that same time back in Europe,&quot; Marie said almost forcefully, &quot;Marie, that is the girl <br />
who had been given the name Marie Cruz by her good father, having forgotten the name <br />
her birth parents had given her, continued to be molded into a 'modern' knight templar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A zealot?&quot; Maddex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, holy warrior. Slayer. Monster-Hunter. Or any other meaningless moniker you want to <br />
give her. Her identity as an alter boy by day and a hunter by night as her aging god father <br />
was a priest by day and a plague doctor by night... but deep down, a part of her still saw <br />
all of this as a game, a task, or at least nothing that was completely dangerous...she didn't <br />
yet understand how dangerous some things that existed like witches could be... but she <br />
was about to learn at the same time that the witchlings were lamenting their error with <br />
Joella and hiding her. <br />
<br />
Marie had heard about a child kidnapper, parents praying for their children's safe return at <br />
the church she serviced at. That was when Marie thought of her father, and wishing to <br />
impress him chose to be a hero. <br />
<br />
She walked down the street she heard the adults talk about, which the police to the best of <br />
their ability had gone down searching but found nothing. But Marie was smaller than they <br />
were, she looked through the nooks and carnies... and she had heard children laughing.... <br />
she followed the sound through a building... and found them... And they all looked at her... <br />
with eyes like a sea of blood, fangs like we'd know as needles, and skin as pale as corpses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come play with us! Join us!&quot; they all said together. And an old man as pale as then, gnarly <br />
and bald and dressed like a gentleman walked among them. And told the girl &quot;Welcome to <br />
your new family.&quot; Marie screamed and ran, and the children followed her. And after she <br />
came back to the building she had followed the noise down into the catacombs from, they <br />
cornered her. And that was when the instinct for survival that had been engraved on her <br />
soul when the landlord who burned her parents bodies tried to burn her awakened to it's <br />
full strength, and all her god father had taught her was put to the test. <br />
<br />
Marie lay there on her hands and knee, sobbing and shaking among the now motionless <br />
child corpses, impaled through the heart or beheaded by her... there was so much blood... <br />
but at the same time so little...<br />
<br />
That was when the man found her, not nearly as upset as a man who had lost his 'family' <br />
should have been, instead he acted like it was a meaningless set back, and in a 'easy come, <br />
easy go' attitude he told her that he'd just start again with her. Marie screamed like a wild <br />
animal, madly catching the man off guard and managing to tear out one of his eyes in the <br />
process.  The pale man at once clawed her face... <br />
<br />
A couple seconds later the pale man was impaled from behind through the heart by a cain <br />
sword belonging to a plague doctor... Her god father would have spanked her bottom <br />
bright red twice over for her action, if he didn't see she was already frightened out of her <br />
mind. He took her in his arms and left the building... by the time morning came, the <br />
corpses of the pale man and the children he had taken for his own had turned to ashes...&quot; <br />
<br />
(again, sorry for this chapter being so sort)</p>
