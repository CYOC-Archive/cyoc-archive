<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn’t take like for Sherri to get Baxter some new clothes to wear, obviously they were prepared.  Getting him dressed was something else.  Baxter’s mind was slipping so fast, he couldn’t even tie his shoes.  After a lot of difficulty, Sherry loaded Baxter into her car and they were off to the farm.<br />
<br />
Since they got such a late start, chores were done and it was time for dinner by the time they arrived at the farm.  Baxter just sat at the table when Barney came in.  The two just looked at each other, Baxter couldn’t think of anything to say.  Sherri interjected, “Barney, this is your twin brother Baxter”, and she smiled over her conquest.  Two free workers for the price of … well no price at all… just free slave labor.<br />
<br />
Barney grinned and sat down at the table.  Baxter could smell the barn on his clothes, but it didn’t seem to matter much.  It was some time later when Baxter suddenly woke up that he realized where he was… or remember where he thought he should be.  Barney was looking down at him with a grin from ear to ear.  Baxter couldn’t help but look at Barney’s crooked, buck teeth – they were shining in the moonlight.  <br />
<br />
“Where…where?” …. “Shhh” was Barney’s reply.  He took Baxter by the hand and led him down the steps.  Baxter’s mind seemed to be clearing when he realized that Barney had a room in a loft over the barn.  But they were leaving it now.  Barney led Baxter a little way past the barn, down a path into the trees.  When they stopped, Baxter saw that there was a small pond there, shining in the moonlight.  Barney winked at Baxter and dropped all his clothes and ran into the pond.  Taking the hint, Baxter dropped his clothes.  It was easier now getting out of them than putting them on.  When he jumped into the water, he felt the warmth of Barney surround him and unwillingly felt his thick foreskin pull back as his dick began to swell.  <br />
<br />
“Really… My name is Barnabus …but they just call me Barney… I don’t mind.  They think I’m stupid … I’m not.  ”  Baxter felt the strong arms of Barney surround him and pull him close.  It was obvious to Baxter that the boy felt the same way toward him as his own body betrayed his lust.  “You’re also not my brother … but I think you’re pretty damn cute …” and he smiled and was about to laugh when he saw Baxter was about to burst into tears.  “Don’t … it’ll be okay … you’ll see….” and Barney’s arms held Baxter close, like a comforting brother.   “I’m not as dumb as I look .. .and neither are you.”  There standing in the pond, in the moonlight, Barney took his hand and wiped away Baxter’s tears and then splashed him.  Baxter was about to splash back when Barney pulled his head toward him and pushed his tongue into Baxter’s mouth.  The embrace and the deep longing kiss were overpowering to Baxter and he gave into his new situation.  <br />
<br />
“Stay…. Don’t Move…” Barney commanded.  And as he let his hand go free of his hold, Baxter felt Barn’s strong hand tugging at his heavy foreskin.  Then he felt something warm and elastic over the top of his own.  The tips of their cocks were warm and protected, touching each other beneath their heavy foreskins, now oozing pre-cum within their protected sheath.  Baxter’s body trembled from these new sensations and his mind was reeling with all the changes that had taken place.  It only took one touch from Barney before Baxter was cumming and it seemed to him that he would never be able to stop.  Barney just laughed when Baxter noticed that he was cumming in buckets too.<br />
<br />
Baxter couldn’t remember when or how they had gotten back to bed.  All he could remember was being waked in the morning.  Barney looked tired and his milky white skin looked almost transparent.  He had dark purple circles under his eyes and Baxter figured he probably looked even worse.  <br />
<br />
When the sat down at the table Baxter took his cue from Barney and started eating with his hands.  When Sherri looked away, Bax tried to see some glint in Barney’s eye – but all that returned was a blank, dull stare.  <br />
<br />
After Sherri left for work and the twins were now alone, Barney turned to Baxter, “I don’t want her to know.  Now we’ve got a lot of work to do before lunch.”  Barney was in complete control &amp; Baxter, for the first time in his life felt what it was like to be protected and submissive.  The work was hard, but his new rugged body and strong, calloused hands made light work.  There were two of them now to share the chores.  <br />
<br />
When they finally sat down to lunch, Baxter realized why Barney acted the way he did.  He had no where else to go, he liked horses and the farm life and no one bothered him.  Now that he had a “brother” life was next to perfect for him.  And because he was so “stoopid”  he never had to cook or clean up after himself or do anything more than a retard was expected.  Baxter’s mind was now clear and he decided to play along for a while and see how this new life suited him.<br />
<br />
After lunch, the sex was incredible and Baxter was now more ready to accept his new life.  He had never had such an experience in his life.  “There’s lots worse thing in life than being a hung and horny teenager”, Barney told him, glistening with the sweat of their lovemaking.  He pulled his coverall over his drying cum and looked at his “brother”/lover.  “You’re going to be on me the rest of the day….” and smiled.<br />
<br />
When Sherri returned from work, it was again, already time for dinner.  “How was your day, boys?”  got answered with dull, blank stares.  “Did you get along okay with your brother?”  <br />
<br />
Barney looked up, slack-jawed and just stared blankly at Sherri.  Totally frustrated, she didn’t even try to communicate with Baxter.  She had her slave labor, and so she didn’t care.  The boys finished their supper like a couple of uncouth barbarians and headed to the barn for bed.  <br />
<br />
Baxter watched.  As soon as the lights were out in the house, Barney was up, hot and horny again.  Tonight there was considerable love-making by the pond, in the pond and back in the barn.  Baxter never enjoyed a roll in the hay as much as he did with his brother.  Life was getting good.   The warmth and love his brother under the blankets was more than he had ever experienced anytime in his life.<br />
<br />
Worrying about his former life was just a dream … but still, if he could get back to his apartment, his life, things could be better for the boys.  He had money, … a place to go.  But still,  oh boy, how he loved his new life.  What would Sherri do if she ever found out the truth?</p>
