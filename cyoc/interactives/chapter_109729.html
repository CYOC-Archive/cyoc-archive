<br />
Arriving in the kitchen in his black furred werewolf fursona; he sees Leon and Peter already seated as Jean silently pads behind him. As she walks past; Jean grabs Nate’s furry ass with her paw as she smiles while taking a seat. Nate feeling flushed shortly joins at the table, just as Regina shows up with the final item for dinner.<br />
“Hmmmmm,” Peter inhaling the delicious aroma; “this the elk father and I took down last week?”<br />
“It&#39;s the last of it Peter,” Regina commenting; “I slow cooked it with some Texas BBQ sauce and got some fresh buns.”<br />
“Pulled elk sandwiches,” Leon licking his lips; “and sweet potato mash,” Leon looking at the casserole dish in front of him.”<br />
“Well stop drooling you two,” Regina commenting; “dig in!”<br />
<br />
With that Nate saw the two male were-lions begin filling their plates with food; Jean shaking her head and mutters “savages”, as she starts piling the pulled elk on her plate. Passing the food to Nate; the werewolf inhales the rich aroma of the game meat. Growling in approval, Nate fills his plate with the rich seasoned meat and various sides. Grabbing a bun to start building his sandwich, Leon speaks up;<br />
“So Nate, when did you meet my daughter?”<br />
Nate chokes just as he takes a bite. Before he could answer Jean interrupts; “dad I told you how we met.”<br />
“I want to hear it from Nate, Jean;” Leon commenting as he rips into his pulled elk sandwich.<br />
“The short version is,” Nate beginning; “I met Jean as I was with Liv Robinson at this barn called the Old Mill.”<br />
“Oh that place,” Peter chuckles; “Most of the were cat/feline prides go there for fun.”<br />
“Yes, Liv told me,” Nate continuing his tale; “well last Friday I met Liv at the Old Mill and we had-“<br />
“Sex,” Peter interrupting again; “did Liv try and use her toys?”<br />
“Peter,” Jean growling; “stop interrupting or I’ll make you mewl like a kitten.”<br />
“Let Nate speak Peter,” Leon is smiling; “unless you want your sister to make good on her threat.” Leon’s grin growing wider; “again.”<br />
“Yes,” Nate continuing; “Liv and I were having sex. We were going for... I don&#39;t know how many times now, in the loft when Jean shows up and starts joining in without so much as an introduction.” Looking at Jean, “you knew I was knotted with Liv yet you just squatted right above my face and start making out with her.<br />
“And you passed out shortly after,” Jean giggling; But not before I gave you a blow job while you licked my snatch to orgasm.”<br />
“Okay,” Leon starting to breathe hard with the talk of sex; “We don’t need to know any more details.”<br />
“Speak for yourself dad,” Peter clearly aroused from the conversation.<br />
Leon growls as he slaps Peter in the back of the head with his meaty paw; “when I say enough, I mean it.”<br />
<br />
With Peter chastised; the rest of dinner passed in silence. Nate eating his elk; his wolf like pupils go wide as he feels Jean’s paw, tickling and teasing his sheathe. Encouraging his member to come out of hiding; Nate tries to fight back but fails. Leon noticing Nate’s discomfort looks at Jean and gives her a cold withering stare. Leon knew her daughter was feeling amorous; but she was going to have to find another way to relieve that stress. Leon needed his daughter’s help for the emergency council session tomorrow.<br />
<br />
“Nate,” Leon speaking up; “let’s you and I talk in private while my children help Regina clean up.”<br />
Getting up; Nate follows Leon to the garage. Before entering, both hear Peter yowling in pain.<br />
“That is one thing Peter could never learn,” Leon shaking his head; “Jean always kept her word when giving him an ultimatum.”<br />
“Enough Jean!” Both Leon and Nate hear Regina shouting; “Let your brother go now!”<br />
“Come,” Leon speaking to Nate as they enter the garage.<br />
<br />
As Nate entered the garage he sees a gorgeous albeit weather worn car. Giving off a low whistle; the werewolf can’t help but admire the vehicle before him.<br />
“It’s a nineteen sixty two Shelby Cobra CSX two thousand,” Leon speaking; “my graduation present for Jean.”<br />
“It’s some car,” Nate looking impressed; “despite its condition.”<br />
“Most of the damage is cosmetic,” Leon answers; “The engine is still sound and the chassis is in excellent condition. It’s the interior that needs the most work.”<br />
“It’s some graduation present,” Nate running a paw over car; “It must have been expensive to purchase.”<br />
“Well,” Leon grinning; “it’s not as if I couldn’t afford it. My vehicle restoration company is quite successful.”<br />
“Yet that isn’t why you wanted to talk to me in private,” Nate responding.<br />
<br />
“Correct,” Leon answers; “I love my daughter. Despite her lifestyle choices, she does mean the world to me. Now don’t get me wrong, Peter is also a good kid, but I’m not as worried about him as I am with Jean.”<br />
“I know the spiel,” Nate speaking; “fathers are always protective of their daughters. Sometimes a bit to protective.”<br />
“Yes,” Leon answering dryly; “look I noticed Jean make a grab for you during diner, she is clearly taken with you.”<br />
“I recently dated a were-panthress who was also smitten with me,” Nate answering; “but it didn’t work out.”<br />
“Any reason why,” Leon asking?<br />
“While she worked as a teller at Moon Lake’s bank,” Nate answering; “it was her second career that became a deal breaker. She was an escort to select were-clients. I found out one of her clients proposed marriage to her.”<br />
“Yeah that would certainly kill the romance,” Leon states; “does Jean know?”<br />
“I’ve told her,” Nate answering; “as well as Liv.”<br />
“Well getting back to my daughter,” Leon speaking; “despite her being amorous with you, I need her help for tomorrow. Elder council business; I’m hoping she takes my place on the council seat one day.”<br />
“Jean told me about that,” Nate answering; “Does the council business have anything to do with Julie Stovall?”<br />
“It does,” Leon answering; “since my daughter is taking law classes at Moon Lake college next semester, I’ll need her to be with me tomorrow. It will be a good for her to start learning the politics involved in dealing with the other reps.”<br />
“So is Jean also going to be the lion queen of the pride,” Nate asking?<br />
“No,” Leon chuckles; “Peter will be the next Lion King, I would have him replace me on the council, but he doesn’t have the temperament to deal with issues larger than billing invoices. Hell he still acts like an immature child at times. You saw when at the dinner table how he thought yours and Jean’s ‘hook up’ was a saucy story from penthouse forum.” Leon sighs, “I hope he finds a mate soon; I want grand cubs to spoil rotten.”<br />
“Well if things work out with me and Jean,” Nate speaking; “you just might get that. Or grand pups. I am a werewolf after all.”<br />
Leon laughs; “that you are. But your fun will have to wait for another night.” Leon escorting Nate out of the garage, “Jean has some work to do with me.”<br />
<br />
Jean in the kitchen hearing her father’s last comment pouts; she was eager for Nate’s lupine rod locked in her, as her own sex eagerly drank Nate’s seed. Looking at Peter who was still sore from getting knocked silly just chuckles as he knows his sister just got denied.<br />
“At least I have a mate,” Jean glaring at Peter; “all you have is a box of tissues by your bed.”<br />
“Every single were-lioness I have met,” Peter grousing; “has only wanted me for my status in the pride. Not for love.”<br />
“Then look outside of the pride,” Jean smacking her brother with a wet paw; “don’t be limited to just were-lioness’s you nit wit.”<br />
“Your sister is right,” Leon overhearing; “while I would prefer my grand cubs to be were-lions, I won’t object to you seeing other weres.” Leon looking at Jean, “please see Nate out, but don’t take too long; I want your help with these dam elder scrolls.”<br />
<br />
Jean saunters towards Nate as he collects his clothing; he is about to defur and put them on when jean stops him.<br />
“No need Nate,” Jean purring; “it’s after dark.”<br />
“I’ve never driven my car while in my fursona,” Nate answering; “not even sure if it’s possible.”<br />
“Of course it is,” Jean giggling; “you just need to put the seat all the way back. Give it a try and drive safe.” Jean kisses the werewolf as she walks him to his car; the snow crunching underneath their paws as they walk. Nate seeing other were’s out despite it being cold all waving their paws in greeting as they walk by.<br />
“We’ll talk tomorrow,” Jean watching Nate getting in; “maybe even have a little fun as well.”<br />
That perks Nate up as he smiles; “that would be great. I’ll see you then.”<br />
<br />
Despite some difficulty; Nate was able to operate the gas and brake pedals with his digitigrade paws after putting the seat all the way back. Driving slow as the snow on the road while not deep was making the pavement slick with the potential of black ice. It took some time but Nate managed to pull into his parent’s driveway. Shutting off the engine, Nate gets out of the car and walks to the front door. Looking back he sees his paw prints on the fresh snow. Not sure what to do; Nate heads inside to see his father up and waiting for him.<br />
“Had fun,” William watching television.<br />
“It was pleasant,” Nate answering; “but Jean and myself never had any sex.”<br />
“Saved you some lamb if your still hungry,” William getting up; “if you don’t eat it, then there is no guarantee it will be their come morning.”<br />
“Why is that;” Nate asking?<br />
“Eric, Spencer and Frieda;” William grins.<br />
“In the basement,” Nate asking?<br />
“I don’t need to tell you what they are doing,” William smiles; “my advice is to eat the lamb.”<br />
“Thanks,” Nate answering; “but I had elk for diner with the Talbots. It was quite good.”<br />
“So was the lamb you mom prepared,” William grins as he walks upstairs.<br />
“Oh dad,” Nate answering; “what with the snowfall, should we be concerned with were paw prints? I left a few from my car to the front entrance.”<br />
“I doubt you’re the only were walking about in the night,” William pondering; “If it makes you feel any better you could take a broom and sweep away your prints if you want. But I wouldn’t worry too much over it. I’m sure the town has dealt with this in the past.</p>
