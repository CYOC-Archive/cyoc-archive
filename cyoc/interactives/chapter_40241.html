<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was just an average thirty-four year old guy with a crummy job. Today was his day off and he was browsing the stores at the mall. He was trying to get ideas for birthdays and holidays. So far he didn't have much luck getting those ideas. He couldn't find anything anyone would like that they didn't already have.<br />
<br />
He had just entered the new arcade he had been hearing about on a whim when he saw a girl come up to another girl and whisper &quot;I think I might have gotten something that may be of help. Follow me.&quot; The two girls looked like they were sisters and Rick watched them leave.<br />
<br />
Rick sighed and said under his breath &quot;Those girls have it easy in life right now. They don't have to worry about paying bills or keeping a job they hate just to pay those bills. I wish I could be like them. Oh to be young again and not have these worries of mine. Heh... maybe that will happen in a million years.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wandered through the arcade until he came to the old prize machine nestled in between Donkey Kong and Street Fighter. He figured that he might get a nice prize to give to his boss' young daughter. She was a cutie and her birthday was coming up. Your boss always threw a birthday party for his daughter and all his employees were invited. At least he was nice even though the job itself sucked.<br />
<br />
Rick put a quarter in and turned the handle. He heard the clinking of the gears and springs and then something fell into the tray. Reaching in and picking it up he discovered that it was a large pink plastic Easter egg. He wondered what could be inside it but decided to wait until he got home to open it.<br />
<br />
As he was heading back to the entrance Rick passed by a fortune telling machine and decided to see what his fortune was. Fortunately the machine had a coin slot as well as a card slot and he inserted two quarters. After a few moments a card popped out and he took it. He was a bit perplexed by what was written on it. It said &quot;ALL YOUR WORRIES WILL MELT AWAY&quot;. Maybe that meant he was going to get a better job so he didn't need to worry about how he was going to pay the bills. He put the card in his pocket and left the arcade and mall.<br />
<br />
Once he got home to his small apartment Rick looked at the egg he had gotten. He held it up to his ear and shook it. He couldn't hear anything rattling around inside. He held the egg up to the light but couldn't tell if there was anything in it. Shrugging he said &quot;Only one way to see if there's anything inside.&quot; He began to twist and turn the egg to try to open it. After several minutes of trying he became a little frustrated and pushed the two halves together. As he did he also twisted it and it popped open.<br />
<br />
There was something in it after all. Some type of fabric fell to the floor and Rick picked it up. When he held it up he could see that it was a girl's one piece swimsuit. He figured that it would fit an eleven year old. That would be perfect since his boss' daughter was going to be eleven in just a month.<br />
<br />
As he was looking at the swimsuit Rick felt pain shoot through his body like it was on fire. He dropped the swimsuit and fell to his knees clutching his stomach. He then fell over onto his side and curled up into the fetal position. He tried to scream but his jaw was clenched tight. All he could do was lay there and either wait for the pain to go away or die.<br />
<br />
Finally after what seemed to be an eternity the pain left as suddenly as it came. Rick lay panting from the ordeal. He was oblivious to where he was or what was going on around him. Slowly he became aware of his surroundings. Something wasn't right. He saw a bed where there shouldn't have been one. It didn't even look like the one he had in his apartment. It had a pink frill around the bottom of it and pink bedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Rick began but stopped in surprise. He was talking but it wasn't his voice that he heard. His voice sounded like that of a girl. It shouldn't sound like that though. Something was definitely wrong here. He sat up and looked around. The room he was in was definitely a girl's room. The walls were a pastel pink and there were shelves with dolls and stuffed animals on them. Hanging on a hook on a door was a white dress with frills on the hem, neck, and sleeves.<br />
<br />
Rick looked down at himself afraid of what he would see. Sure enough his suspicions were confirmed when he saw that he didn't have a dick anymore. There were two small bumps on his chest and a lock of long red hair swung into view. There was no doubt about it, he was a girl. If he had to guess he would say that he was about eleven or twelve. He was a little confused as to why he was completely naked but that was a small thing compared to what had happened to him physically.<br />
<br />
As Rick was pondering what happened he heard his boss ask &quot;Are you ready Christine!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine was Rick's boss' daughter. Somehow he had been teleported into their house. What was going on here? He couldn't hear Christine's reply but he heard his boss say &quot;Alright! I'm going to see if your sister is ready!&quot; Sister? Christine was an only child.<br />
<br />
Rick heard a know on the door and his boss ask &quot;Are you about ready Clara!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick said the first thing that came to mind. &quot;Uh... no!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry up!&quot; his boss said. &quot;The water park is part of you and your sister's birthday! This is your eleventh birthday and both of you wanted to go to the water park! Do you even have your swimsuit on!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... no!&quot; Rick said to stunned to say anything but the truth. It seemed like he was Christine's twin sister now. Though Christine's birthday wasn't for another month. How the hell had a month gone by?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry up and get it on!&quot; his boss nearly yelled. &quot;Also make sure you put on a shirt and shorts! Come downstairs when you're done!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok!&quot; Rick said. He heard his boss leave and he looked around. There on the bed was a pair of shorts a pink glitter heart on one of the rear pockets, a yellow short sleeve shirt with a white flower on the breast, and the blue swimsuit that came out of the egg. He sighed and decided to play along for now. Maybe he could get to the arcade and find something to fix this.<br />
<br />
As Rick was putting on the swimsuit he wondered if this wasn't such a bad thing. He didn't have the worries he had and it was summer so there was no school. Maybe he wouldn't try to fix this. He finished getting dressed for the water park and went downstairs.</p>
