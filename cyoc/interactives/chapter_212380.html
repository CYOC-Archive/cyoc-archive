<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob did not really need to sleep in his current form. He went into a very low energy rest, but never fully losing consciousness. Jacob found what was a borderline dream state at the edge of the low energy boundary, where he lost track of time. The 7pm alarm never went off because Jacob turned it off several minutes early. He had left Kate on the bed while he went to get a shower. Jacob realized a few moments while standing under the water spray that he didn&#39;t really need a shower, but he liked the warm water and how it felt. The shower was short and he was in the car driving away while Katie slept.<br />
<br />
Jacob didn&#39;t really pay attention to himself while driving, but at one of the stop lights, he saw the flash of a camera. He wondered for a moment, then realized he was still naked, showing stripper G cup tits to the world. Jacob shrank his chest into a man&#39;s chest, but still drove naked to work. He felt he was driving to the wrong place when things did not look familiar, and he was right. Jacob was driving to his old employer, as  he was now a partner in an accounting firm he founded with his best friend Larry. Jacob still arrived at the office park early, and found the space with his name on it. Jacob then formed his middle aged male body wearing a loose fitting suit, and stepped out of the car. The firm&#39;s space was not large, and his office was the smallest, but only he had a dedicated junior accountant outside his office. &quot;I remember Larry,&quot; Jacob thought as he looked at the name plates on the office doors. The photos of Jacob and some of the office staff caused Jacob to adjust his wardrobe slightly to a shiny latex bodysuit sporting a generous bulge. &quot;Hmmm...I don&#39;t remember these photos..,&quot; Jacob thought as he tried to remember this reality. Jacob&#39;s office was also different, as he had a chair and under the desk was a large, shallow dry sink. Jacob then went though all the doors and drawers in the office to inventory what he had. Jacob did not have a computer on his desk, it was on a smaller table on wheels in the corner. The photos in his office showed Jacob&#39;s similar dress and one had everyone in latex skinsuits for some bicycle riding thing. Jacob gave up trying to jog his memory and sat down to go through the folders on his desk when Larry walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay Jacob?&quot; asked Larry, looking concerned, &quot;...I mean, normally your not here until 10 or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine. I didn&#39;t work yesterday, so I wanted to get in early to get caught up,&quot; Jacob replied, hoping to put Larry at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,  you drove Katie&#39;s car. So I thought I&#39;d check,&quot; Larry smiled and reached down to kiss Jacob on the cheek while massaging Jacob&#39;s shoulder. Larry stood up slowly afterward, closed the door to Jacob&#39;s office, and then sat down in the chair in front of Jacob&#39;s desk. &quot;Alright,&quot; Larry groaned, &quot;talk to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might have had a cold Larry, really...your worried about nothing,&quot; Jacob said trying to brush this off.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! Jacob, that&#39;s ridiculous. Shape shifters don&#39;t get sick, at least not what we humans get. What&#39;s going on? Do I need to call Kate?&quot; Larry said, his level of alarm and worry continuing to escalate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, it&#39;s all good. Do you want me to drain your cock or put a plug in your ass to prove it?&quot; asked Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you haven&#39;t offered that to me in a while. What the fuck is going on Jacob?,&quot; Larry said, clearly knowing something is off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been having some lapses in memory lately. Fuzzy details and I not remembering things right. I&#39;ve had issues keeping my form,&quot; Jacob said truthfully.<br />
<br />
Larry&#39;s alarm left his body as his body posture and language changed. A more remorseful Larry gently said, &quot;Hey...sorry. It&#39;s just sometimes you get tunnel vision with work and you don&#39;t take care of yourself. Come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob was not really interested in going with Larry, but he did, into Larry&#39;s office, and into a bedroom suite behind Larry&#39;s office. Larry closed the door and took off his suit and white unitard underwear. A naked Larry got onto the same bed type of bed and mattress that Jacob had at home.<br />
<br />
Larry smiled, and whispered loudly, &quot;I&#39;ve still got that those weighted balls you put in my prostate, massaging me with every step for over ten years. That never gets old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry wasn&#39;t a small guy, but Jacob was sensing something strange here. Soon, he was in liquid form, and took Larry into his body, giving him the breathing tube and entering his holes, including his man boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking milk,&quot; Jacob thought, &quot;I got to get better and remembering this stuff. &quot; Jacob was just getting started when Larry&#39;s orgasm was already at the edge, and went right over. &quot;Shit,&quot; thought Jacob. Larry&#39;s orgasm didn&#39;t flatten out as it got closer to climax, but went right over the top and he missed it. Jacob did his best to salvage the situation by not only draining Larry&#39;s balls and prostate, but taking it slow to milk as much of Larry&#39;s chest as possible. Jacob felt Larry&#39;s body go limp as he drifted off to sleep. It must have been a while for Larry was Jacob&#39;s thought. A few minutes later, Jacob looked down on the sleeping naked body of Larry, then turned to quietly exit the room and back to his office. The other person already in the office was busy in a cubicle, and Jacob made it back to his office unseen. Larry wasn&#39;t much to feed on, but it scratch an itch that Jacob didn&#39;t know he had. The whole office left for lunch except Jacob, who took the time to relax in the dry sink in liquid form under his desk. Jacob wondered why he had this here and why he felt safe and content, but no memories came to him to explain it. Jacob was alone in thought when some time later his junior accountant brought in a paper ledger to get double checked, at least that is what the post-it note said. Jacob waited for the young man to leave before resuming his form and then pulling up his chair to <br />
go through the ledger. Jacob&#39;s red pen made a few edits, and in about twenty minutes took the book back to the junior accountant and said, &quot;They need to correct the values in the red circles, and then highlight the changes.&quot; Jacob then returned to his office and resumed going through the client folders that were on his desk for review. Jacob made his changes in red, and took the folders to the various desks of those in the firm who prepared them, making Larry&#39;s three folders his last stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Found something I missed in all three. Damn your good,&quot; lamented Larry. &quot;And thanks for earlier. I know you like more milk, but my wife hates that I lactate at all, even though she suckles them too,&quot; Larry said gratefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, I&#39;m sorry I kept increasing their size and capacity, what can I say, I like boobs,&quot; Jacob admitted.<br />
<br />
Larry got serious for a moment, &quot;You&#39;ve not milked me like that for a long time Jacob. I don&#39;t know why you won&#39;t talk to me, but I&#39;ll shut up if you&#39;ll do that again Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob looked at Larry a little upset, &quot;Are you trying to hustle me Larry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right I am. I used to be your regular lunch feeding,&quot; Larry said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how many divorces have I helped cause for you Larry?,&quot; Jacob threw back.<br />
<br />
Larry sighed deeply, and shared, &quot;Yea....I&#39;m almost sixty, fat, and a fourth wife just so I have someone to go home to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob offered, &quot;Say the word, and you can  have an eighteen year old stripper body, tits that won&#39;t quit and a tight pussy right below your balls. Katie likes it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry smiled, &quot;Yea,  you always say that. I&#39;ll hold you to that one day. Then you will have to milk me and Kate at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob shook his head, &quot;Fuck you too Larry and have a good weekend. You know Kate doesn&#39;t mind if you come over. She&#39;ll pound your ass too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tempt me Jacob. Have a good fucking weekend. Get feeling better,&quot; Larry said as he got up from his desk, and walked Jacob back to his office for a final passionate kiss on the lips. Larry broke from the kiss and smiled, &quot;Tell me what&#39;s going on Monday, will ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about I just fuck your brains out instead and give you the funbags I want to play with instead?&quot; Jacob countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had me at fuck, but the funbags have to wait until I can go home with you,&quot; Larry insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal,&quot; Jacob whispered as Larry turned and left for the day. Jacob was processing a lot of memories with him and Larry. Some good, but a lot not so good.<br />
<br />
Jacob did the rounds once more to see if there were any client folders for review, and left when none were left. Jacob&#39;s drive home naked was uneventful as a naked upper middle aged man.<br />
<br />
Jacob parked the car in the garage, when the kitchen door opened and Kate greeted him with hir usual pose. &quot;That never gets old to see,&quot; Jacob thought to himself as he got out of the car, keeping his eyes on Kate.</p>
