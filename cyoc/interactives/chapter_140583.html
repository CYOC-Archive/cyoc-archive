<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“If it’s alright with you guys I kind of want to see the other me,” Samantha said meekly. The others turned curiously towards the half Samoan girl, surprised she would voice an opinion. “Sammy you sure,” Katie asked. “I mean she looks a lot different than you do. It could be a bit of a shock.”<br />
<br />
“And that’s why I want to meet her,” she stated. “Look, I’m no magic expert or anything but everything that I’ve seen Katie, Kellie and Mary do is well..amazing. From what I’ve heard from Katie and Lisa the girls in the other timeline know magic. Maybe, maybe I can learn how she got her magic.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smirked as she gazed at the mini giantess. She had a feeling that once the girls got a taste of magic and learned about the other timeline they would be curious if they too could acquire magic as well. Kellie had already seen in the past month how Lisa and Kumiko anxiously wanted to be part of any spells Katie and Kellie used. Now it appeared Samantha too wanted in on the action. “I just hope she doesn’t freak out when she finds out the other her is pregnant,” she thought.<br />
<br />
Merlin’s smiled as he looked at the group of girls in front of him. He could see great potential in all of them. Kellie had managed to bring eight girls to her side, making the group nine strong. “Neve would of believed my daughter could gather this many to her side,” he thought happily. “I have not seen a group such as this since the round table, perhaps..perhaps my daughter will indeed be the one to finally foil Morgan.”<br />
<br />
“Samantha I believe that is an excellent suggestion,” Merlin stated. “I wil talk with my doppelgänger and the Katie from that timeline. Hopefully by this afternoon you will all be able to visit the other Samantha.”<br />
<br />
“Um Mr. Merlin,” Claudia said meekly. “How is that going to be possible. Kellie said something about needing a belt to cross over.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Kellie does need a belt if she wishes to cross over,” Merlin said. “However the rest of you can traverse the timeline without any magical assistance. I should warn you though that since this is your first trip the chances are you will be disoriented and perhaps a little sick.”<br />
<br />
“Well I don’t know about you guys but there’s no way I’m letting a little sickness get in the way,” Lisa exclaimed. “I’m in.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t let Lisa have all the fun,” Kumiko smirked. “I’m in too.”<br />
<br />
“Claudia,” Mika sighed. “What do you say. Want to help me keep these two out of trouble?” Claudia smiled, nodding in response as she stepped forward.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Karen stepped forward as well. “If you can do this then so can I,” Mary Elise proclaimed. Kellie smiled at her group of friends as they each stepped forward, willing to bravely traverse the timelines to help her. “Wow thank you guys,” she sniffed.<br />
<br />
“Girls I am truely touched by this,” Merlin said. “Now, I would suggest you prepare yourselves and get some rest. You will all depart this afternoon.”<br />
<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed as she finished cleaning the apartment her and her fiance rented. One of the joys the young couple discovered is that living so far from you essentially could do as you pleased. This meant that the couple had already established what their home life was like before marriage. Unfortunately for the two their marriage was creeping up rather quickly.<br />
<br />
Samantha had learned from her future daughters appearance that she would be born in July. That meant the couple had only six months to plan the event while studying for school. While they at first had considered waiting for school to be finished, their parents insistence that they be married before the baby was born had overridden any of those ideas. “Mike,” Samantha called. “Have you finished cleaning the bathroom?”<br />
<br />
Mike poked his head out of the bathroom, somewhat sweaty from the work he was doing. “Yeah hon just finishing up,” he said. “Why are we doing all this anyway? I mean why did Katie say these people from the other timeline were coming here?”<br />
<br />
Samantha wiped her brow as she now remembered the conversation she had with Katie. Katie had Skyped with her recently, telling her everything about her mother and the other timeline. Samantha was of course shocked to hear this but did not get angry that Katie had kept the secret for so long. What had astounded her though was when she had learned that the girls in this other timeline wanted to visit her.<br />
<br />
“Why do they want to visit me,” Samantha had asked. Katie explained how Mary Elise, Claudia, herself and Kellie had already visited the timeline. While Mika was being told about it by Claudia Katie learned that the Kellie in that timeline wanted to see Samantha. Apparently the Samantha in that timeline was anxious to meet her.<br />
<br />
“I told you Mike,” Samantha said. “Katie’s mom and the other me wanted to see us. Apparently the other me was super excited, especially after Claudia and Mary paid them a visit.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Mike said. “So how does this work. Do we call this girl Kellie, or Ms. O’Toole, or what? I’ve never had to deal with long deceased moms reincarnated as a teenager before.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Samantha groaned in annoyance. “This is the first time I’ve dealt with this before too. Guess we just...act natural.”<br />
<br />
As the college couplegazed at one another they noticed a bright light beginning to shine in the corner of their apartment. As the two watched they noticed what appeared to be a small white window begin to grow in their apartment. Gaping in astonishment they watched the portal expand before winking out of existence in a bright flash. Rubbing their eyes the two blinked ina astonishment as they beheld a large group of teens now standing in their living room.<br />
<br />
“Are you guys okay,” Kellie asked as she turned towards her friends. Katie and the others appeared disoriented and slightly nauseous as they now tried to get their bearings. “Ugh been better,” Samantha groaned as she now slowly rose to her feet. Teen Samantha’s eyes widened as she saw her boyfriend Mike and herself standing behind a couch.<br />
<br />
Samantha had felt her jaw drop as she saw a teenage girl that looked very much like herself suddenly appear in her living room. As the girl stood Samantha was dumbstruck to find that the girl appeared to not only be biracial but quite tall as well. “Ummm hi tall me,” Samantha said meekly, waving at the girl.<br />
<br />
Teen Samantha blinked as she approached the college age girl. She could see that the girl was her, the only difference being this girl wasn’t Samoan. As the teen looked a little closer her eyes grew wide as she beheld the baby bump the girl now sported. “Ummm hi pregnant me.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she looked at her old friend. It had been far too long since she had seen both Samantha and Mike. She had heard from her daughter that the couple was now engaged, considering she had assisted Katie in getting the two together in the original timeline, she couldn’t help but feel a bit of joy. “Samantha,Mike “she said warmly. “So glad you were willing to let us visit.”<br />
<br />
“Um no problem Ms. O’Toole,” Mike whispered. “Or is it just Kellie, I’m kinda trying to figure this out.”<br />
<br />
“Understandable,” Kellie giggled. “Just call me Kellie Okay. Anyway glad we could all meet. Hoping that me and my friends can visit you all more often.”</p>
