<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff spent the week living in fear.  He was sleeping out in his family&#39;s barn because he was sure Dave would smother him in his sleep if he went back to the room. On top of that he didn&#39;t understand what had happened to his cock.  He use to be bigger than most guys and now he was smaller than most grade schoolers.  For the first time ever he was changing in locker room stalls out of fear of other guys seeing his pathetic penis. Jeff was sure his girlfriend was going to break-up with him once she figured out he wasn&#39;t packing a pipe anymore.  She&#39;d probably assume he had been tricking her somehow, if that was even possible. As the week went by Jeff started hearing rumors that his cousin Ryan was swinging a massive dick, which just added insult to injury.  What the fuck was happening to his life.  <br />
<br />
The bell rang and Friday was over. Jeff caught a ride home from school from a friend. He approached the house slowly, Dave&#39;s truck was there.  Jeff knew what he had done was wrong and that he probably couldn&#39;t make it better. He didn&#39;t know how he was going to make it, sharing a room with Dave.  He entered the house and found his parents talking to Dave at the table. &quot;Well if that&#39;s what you want, son&quot; their Father was in the process of saying as Jeff entered, &quot;then we&#39;re not going to talk you out of it.&quot; Jeff must have had a quizzical look on his face as he took the scene in. &quot;Jeff&#39;ll appreciate having a room to himself anyways&quot; their Mother chimed in, looking at Jeff. &quot;What?&quot; Was all Jeff could get out. Dave looked at him, &quot;I rented an apartment in town, I&#39;m moving out this weekend.&quot; Dave turned back to his parents, &quot;I got you two a gift card for the Italian place you like and made a reservation for you tonight, sort of a thanks for letting me stay here so long past 18.&quot; Jeff&#39;s heart rate shot up, this was it, Dave was getting them out of the house so he could get revenge.  Their parents graciously accepted, Jeff headed back to the room he shared with his brother hoping to grab some supplies for spending the night elsewhere. Dave entered the room shortly after, &quot;about last weekend,&quot; Dave started quietly, &quot;I&#39;m not cool with what you did, but I&#39;m not going to come after you either.&quot; Jeff looked at his brother incredulously. &quot;I just want to get out of here and get on with my life&quot; he continued. Jeff didn&#39;t know what to make of this, part of him was screaming that it was a trap, but then again Dave and he had always had a good relationship before. &quot;Ok&quot; Jeff said hesitantly, and put his half packed bag down. <br />
<br />
A few hours later, Jeff watched his parent&#39;s leave for the restaurant. He had waited until Dave left the room and finished packing his bag, leaving it safely tucked away near the water irrigation pump valve out in the field. Just in case this is a trap. Jeff gave Dave a wide berth most of the night. When his older brother was in the kitchen making himself Dinner, Jeff stayed in the bedroom. When Dave went to the bedroom to pack up his stuff to move the next day, Jeff went to eat in the kitchen. The fridge was pretty picked over, with the exception of some tuna salad, bread, and some milk. Jeff was no cook, so he made himself a tuna salad sandwich with milk to wash it down.  Dave came down the hallway, stopping at the entrance to the kitchen. &quot;You know, you could have slept in your bed this week,&quot; he offered almost off handedly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have done anything to you that would have gotten me in trouble too. I mean I&#39;m not an idiot&quot; Jeff finished drinking his milk, it tasted a little off, there was a little grit in the last few drops. He opened his mouth to reply, but became dizzy, he could no longer move his body.  Jeff slumped to the floor. He watched, powerless as Dave walked over to him, dropped to one knee in front of him, and asked sarcastically, &quot;What&#39;s wrong, brother? not feeling well?&quot;<br />
<br />
David picked up Jeff and threw him over his shoulder, out of the house and into a waiting wheelbarrow out side. Jeff found himself conscious, yet unable to move a muscle. As he rolled Jeff out into the field he laid out his plan. &quot;You see no real brother of mine would have done what you did, so I&#39;m pretty sure you owe me one big time,&quot; Jeff explained, &quot;and you know apartments and furniture and food all cost money. Money I don&#39;t make just working the fields.&quot; Dave&#39;s tone gained a note of pride, &quot;so I figured, seeing as you owed me one for smashing my nuts, they still hurt by the way, the very least you could do is use your body to make me the money I need to live for while.&quot; They were approaching the irrigation pump. Dave continued, &quot;I knew you would never help me out willingly so I went down to Randy and got some of those pills he&#39;s so fond of using on ladies and laced pretty much everything in the fridge with them.&quot; They were at the pump, Jeff could see his backpack tucked under some brush. &quot;and I went on the internet, into some really interesting chat rooms and found some nice gentlemen who were willing to pay to fuck a nice young man like yourself,&quot; Dave finished as he threw Jeff over the pipe face down, then removed his pants and boxers leaving him naked from the waste down. &quot;They should be here in a few minutes&quot; Dave said placing his mouth right next to Jeff&#39;s ear, &quot;but before they come run a train on you, I&#39;m going to do a little experiment, see I&#39;ve been too afraid to even jack it since you viced my boys, so now Im going to try in you.&quot; Jeff heard the click of a bottle open and a little squirt from a squeeze. Dave placed a bottle of lube on the pipe near Jeff&#39;s face. After only a second of anticipation, Dave shoved his short thick slick cock into Jeff&#39;s ass and started pumping.  Jeff wanted to scream from the pain of having his ass wretched open by his brothers chode, but couldn&#39;t force himself to make a sound. After about 10 minutes he heard Dave moan and felt a warm fluid dripping down his ass cheek. &quot;Looks like they still work&quot; Dave huffed, &quot;and just in time here come your dates&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff regained the ability to move the next morning, Dave left him bent over the pipe. Six random men took turns wrecking Jeff&#39;s once virgin hole.  He could barely walk. Layer ofter layer of cum had dried on his back, ass, and legs. He gathered his clothes, and gentle put them on.  While part of him enjoyed the sex, the entire being powerlessly raped part was not something he was into. He found a note in his pocket, it just said &quot;$4,000 who would you even tell&quot; in his brothers handwriting. Jeff limped home slowly. He just wanted to get clean.</p>
