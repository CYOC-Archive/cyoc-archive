<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shannon was by all accounts a fairly successful woman for her age. In less then a year after graduating from her state college, she had managed to land a marketing job at a large company. After working there for the past year and a half she had managed to set herself up well for someone her age. Shannon lived alone in a moderately nice apartment in the city, not too far away from her work.<br />
<br />
Single since a nasty breakup in college, Shannon had avoided serious romances, preferring to just relax (or rage) with her friends when she could. While not considered outstanding in any individual category for her looks, the 5&#39;5&quot; woman was considered cute overall and had no trouble getting by.<br />
<br />
While she was happy to have had such a good streak of success post-college, including her well-paying job, Shannon was starting to feel as if she was stuck in a rut. Life had settled into a predictable pattern, and she felt it was high time for her to mix things up with something fun or daring.<br />
 <br />
One day, she got exactly what she wished for. Returning from an early morning trip to the corner market, Shannon found a small package sitting outside her apartment door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange,&quot; she muttered to herself, &quot;I don&#39;t remember ordering anything this week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hefting her grocery bag in one hand, she scooped up the very light box and peers at the label.<br />
<br />
It was addressed to her alright, and sent from some nondescript company called &#39;Remote Services Inc.&#39;.<br />
<br />
Shrugging to herself, Shannon fished out her keys, unlocked her apartment and went inside.<br />
<br />
Tossing her keys on her dining table, she hefted the grocery bag on the counter before digging some scissors out of a nearby drawer. Carefully, she sliced through the tape on the box and opened it up.<br />
<br />
Removing a small bundle of bubble-wrap, she unfolded it to reveal what looked like a cross between a smartphone and an old-fashioned bulky TV remote. <br />
<br />
It had a mid-sized, modern looking screen, but below it sat a large number of buttons, some of whose symbols defied her understanding. On the sides were a few switches and dials, and at the end of the remote, instead of the normal section for an infrared signaler, there was what appeared to be a miniature radar dish.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like two eras of technology just smashed themselves together!&quot; Shannon said aloud, chuckling quietly as she used a free hand to directly pick up the remote. Looking on the side switches, she spotted the standard power symbol on one and flicked it forward.<br />
<br />
With a deep humming sound that denoted far more power than should be easily held in such a device, the screen and keys lit up, a few status diodes along the remote were flashing red as well. A small loading graphic appeared onscreen in the shape of a circle. After just a few moments, the circle completed and the diodes all went green.<br />
<br />
The loading screen had barely finished when a new message appeared; &quot;Searching for default user...searching...located.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon was surprised when her name appeared at the top of the screen, accompanied by a 3D model of herself, complete with accurate measurements and the simple outfit she was currently wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; she exclaimed, nearly dropping the remote in surprise, &quot;How did it know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding to fiddle with the remote some more, she started scrolling through what seemed to be a large number of menus. Everything seemed to be related to changing things about herself, others, or even the world in some way.<br />
<br />
This is some toy. Shannon thought to herself as she clicked back onto the main screen that showed her digital image. <br />
<br />
She looked at her rather average statistics and saw they could be modified from here too. Casually selecting her breast size, the readout displayed B-cup, which was accurate. Turning one of the dials on the side of the remote, she saw A-cup slide into B and then C. Her little avatar reflected this, becoming much more top-heavy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, if only.&quot; She snorted to herself before going back to the main screen again. She then noticed two small buttons had lit up, one green and the other red, when she did so. In the middle of the screen a status box had appeared; &quot;Save Changes: Y/N?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon stared at the green button, which pulsed invitingly. On a whim, she pressed it, and a small circular wave of energy shot out from the little dish on the end of the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gahh!&quot; she yelled, dropping the remote onto the counter in surprise. She was just about to pick it up again when a pressure emanated from her chest.<br />
<br />
She froze as the sound of stretching fabric was heard. The shocked woman stared, dumbfound as her small breasts began to gurgle and expand outward, straining against her plain t-shirt. Out and out more flesh pressed, lifting the shirt up slightly from her waist as it tried to accommodate the new tits that had sprung up beneath it. Two points poked through the fabric of the shirt as her nipples grew in time her breasts, and she tried to ignore the little pleasurable sparks that shot out from them as they rubbed against the tight fabric of her shirt.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, the growth halted, and Shannon fell back onto a barstool by her kitchen counter, eyes not leaving the mounds that now took up a much larger part of her chest. .<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy...holy shit!!!&quot; she shouted to no one in particular, hefting one in her hand. She bit back a moan at the increased sensitivity it now held as she lightly squeezed it, her nipples still buzzing insistently each time they rubbed against cloth.<br />
<br />
Tearing her eyes (and hand) away from her new tits, Shannon picked up the remote from where she&#39;d dropped it. The screen now read; &quot;Changes Complete.&quot; Glancing at the options on the screen and the buttons below it, she searched for some kind of undo button. Not finding it for the moment, she went back to her statistics and selected the breast size function again. Turning the dial back until it said &quot;A-cup&quot; again, she watched as her avatar returned to normal.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Save Changes?&quot; notification had barely popped up when she slammed the green button. She clutched the remote as she felt pressure again on her breasts. Slowly, the orbs compacted down with gentle creaking sounds, her shirt loosened while her nipples became less sensitive.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, she was back to being the same Shannon that had walked through the door that morning, albeit with a disheveled shirt and a wild look on her face. After peeking down her looser collar to ensure everything was back to normal, Shannon closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths.<br />
<br />
Despite her initial panic, as she calmed down from the shock of what had just occurred she couldn&#39;t stop a broad smile from alighting on her face.<br />
<br />
Well. She thought to herself. Looks like things just got a lot more interesting around here.</p>
