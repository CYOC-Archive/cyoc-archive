<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny felt her body start to fill out as she approached puberty. Two nascent little mounds formed on her chest as her hips and butt started to swell a little. This was definitely different that growing up as a boy. Suddenly, her body jolted upwards as a growth spurt hit her. More swelling all around. Her legs felt so long and thick, her butt so bulbous and round, her breasts so full and swelling. Still, she grew. Her clothing morphed into an outfit similar to her sister’s, track pants and a tight T-shirt. She felt a sensation like something was falling on her head, looking up she noticed the ceiling getting closer. Instinctively, she ducked. Then, the changing ceased.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
Jenny looked down at Emily. Emily was still standing there, apparently oblivious to the changes, holding the Chronivac remote in her hand and staring up at Jenny. Jenny realized that she must look a bit strange, standing on a chair and ducking so that the ceiling did not hit her. Collecting herself, Jenny stood up straight, noticing that she still had a few inches of clearance from the ceiling, even on the chair.<br />
<br />
“Uh, nothing,” Jenny said. “Excuse me.” She snatched the remote from Emily’s hand. “That’s mine,” she said and held it firmly with both hands, silently vowing never to let go of it again.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” said Emily. “I was wondering.”<br />
<br />
“Yep, mine. No big deal.”<br />
<br />
Jenny stepped down from the chair, feeling a bit of disorientation at her change in size. Just a minute ago, it had taken every ounce of strength she had to move this chair and climb up on it. It seemed tiny now. Everything around her seemed a bit tiny, actually.<br />
<br />
She looked down at herself. Her breasts seemed huge. Although any breasts on her would seem big, she figured. She doubted that she had really put 1 and 4 in as her age. Few 14-year-olds would have breasts like these.<br />
<br />
Lower still, she saw her bare feet. Vertigo hit her, and she felt herself swaying. Her legs seemed to stretch on for miles down to her distant feet below. <br />
<br />
She was tall, very tall.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay,” asked Emily.<br />
<br />
Jenny looked up at her and steadied herself. Now that she was on the floor with Emily, she realized that Emily did not seem quite as gigantic as she had thought her to be. In fact, Emily looked to be only a few inches taller than her.<br />
<br />
“Emily?” she said, not sure how to ask this question except to say it plainly. “How tall are you?”<br />
<br />
“Are you joking?”<br />
<br />
“Humor me.”<br />
<br />
“Did you hit your head or something?”<br />
<br />
Jenny just stared at her.<br />
<br />
“I’m 6’5” and three quarters. Everyone knows that. Been that tall since I turned 19 last year. I keep hoping for that next quarter inch. Would be nice to just say 6’6” without feeling like a liar.”<br />
<br />
It took Jenny a few seconds to sort through this new information. First, Emily was still very tall, and that meant that Jenny was now over six feet tall as well. Second, Emily was back to 20 years old again. The Chronivac must have altered her age back to her last setting from before Jenny became a toddler.<br />
<br />
Jenny looked around at the room. The pictures on the walls now showed another tall girl with a similar athletic build to Emily standing next to Emily and their parents. In the trophy case, there were new trophies and pictures. These new ones all seemed basketball themed, and the pictures all depicted the same tall girl from the family portraits. She wore a jersey in them all and held a basketball in some.<br />
<br />
Jenny figured that this new girl must be her. She was not bad looking, not gorgeous, but not bad.<br />
<br />
She too was a sports star now, it seemed.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” said Emily waving at her. “Anyone home? Earth to Emily, you’re spacing out on me. What’s the matter with you?”<br />
<br />
“N-nothing, I’m fine.”<br />
<br />
“How many fingers am I holding up?” asked Emily holding up two fingers on her hand.<br />
<br />
“Stop it. I’m fine. I just need to lie down for a minute.”<br />
<br />
Emily let her hand drop and smiled, “My sister the astronaut. Welcome back to Earth. Find any space rocks in your expedition to the ceiling?”<br />
<br />
“Very funny,” said Jenny. (Emily had said, “Sister.” No more calling her, “Mommy,” thank God.) “I’m going to my room.”<br />
<br />
“Wait,” said Emily. “How was your first varsity practice?”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” she said. (Varsity? How old was she?) “It was fine.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously, did you hit your head or something? You seem a bit out of it.”<br />
<br />
“I’m good, just a bit tired out, exhausted. I’m going to lie down.”<br />
<br />
She walked off weaving down the hallway, feeling a bit unsteady on her new long legs. It didn’t help that everything about her body felt wrong. Her feet seemed huge. Her crotch felt empty. Her muscles felt too strong and seemed to overemphasize every movement she made. Her big ass and hips swayed wide, throwing off her balance. And her breasts, well, they moved. That was weird enough by itself.<br />
<br />
Jenny was happy to find the door to her room open and the Chronivac sitting next to her computer where she had left it what seemed like days ago now. Her room did not appear to have changed much. The same band posters were on the walls. The sheets were the same, and the bed was unmade just as she had left it that morning, back when she had been a 14-year-old boy named Jeff. There was a gym bag with a pair of worn out basketball sneakers next to it. The sneakers looked enormous.<br />
<br />
On the dresser, things were a bit different. There she found some assorted make up and a small purse. She set the remote down next to the Chronivac and picked up the purse. Her purse.<br />
<br />
She found a wallet in it. Her wallet. She pulled out a driver’s license with her name on it (next to a lousy picture of her new face). She knew she felt older than 14. The birthday on the license was the same date only two years older. She was 16. Her height on the license said she was 6’3” tall.<br />
<br />
“Interesting,” she said and wondered what it was like to drive.<br />
<br />
Sixteen…<br />
<br />
Sixteen and already over six feet tall, probably still growing. Sixteen and playing on the girl’s varsity basketball team. Sixteen and sporting a huge pair of breasts.<br />
<br />
She found a photo in the purse that made her heart sink. It depicted her, smiling, in the arms of Andrew Miller. Andrew was the star of the boy’s varsity basketball team. They looked like a happy couple.<br />
<br />
“No way,” she said. “No way is that happening.”<br />
<br />
She sat down at the computer and looked at her settings on the Chronivac. Her stats confirmed what the license said, 16 and 6’3”.<br />
<br />
“Sexual Orientation” still showed her to be “Heterosexual” as well.<br />
<br />
“Okay, let’s fix all of this,” she grabbed the mouse ready to fix everything back to normal. Time to be Jeff again.<br />
<br />
But, she paused.<br />
<br />
Did she really want to change everything back? As weird as the situation was now, she felt sort of curious about this new life she had stumbled into. The whole point of the Chronivac was to change things, after all. Well, it certainly had worked. What would it hurt to live as Jenny for a day or two? Her sister was a sports star. She herself was well on her way to becoming one as well. She was taller, stronger, and older. She was female. As strange as that was, it was still something new. What would it be like at school? What would it be like to be Jenny?<br />
<br />
What will she do?</p>
