<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the end of his grimly bland feast several hours later, Jeff noticed it was getting dark. It was strange. It was as if his mind had switched off or something, and came back once he was full. He vaguely remembered dipping his head down to grab mouthfuls of grass now and then and chewing on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really all I did all day? Was eat a field of grass?&quot; <br />
<br />
He looked back over his flank, and was greeted by his donkey shape. The shadows were very long as the sun was about to dip over the horizon. His large donkey ears crowning his head, stood out the longest. His ears! He forgot he had those ridiculous things. He mostly forgot he was still a fucking farm animal, but his ears were the most-forgotten parts of him. Another load of shit plopped out of him at that momeny. This time, he distinctly took note of it. He had also been shitting and pissing throughout the day with no control whatsoever!<br />
<br />
Humiliation quickly set in.<br />
<br />
&quot;The stupid ears of a donkey. On the top-sides if my elongated head..... and donkey shit dropping out without bring able to wipe....&quot;<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth to mutter to himself, but was greeted with the even more humiliating sounds of his new species: &quot;hhhhhaawww...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff almost wanted to cry. The shame and humiliation were setting in. This wasn&#39;t fun anymore. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, that large virile jackass from before came huffing up to him very strongly. Jeff immediately knew what he wanted, but he wasn&#39;t in the mood. Too bad for Jeff, as his body knew what it wanted. Jeff was still horny from before, and his increased humiliation was sparking his desires back to its original levels. <br />
<br />
Jeff saw the big black organ between the other male&#39;s hind quarters. If he hadn&#39;t taken several dumps through the course of the day, most of that donkeys sperm would still be up inside of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Err hhaww eerrr hhaaww,&quot; Jeff brayed, as he knew his resistance to being the bottom to a careless jack was not strong enough. He felt the tingling sensations from inside, even before he was mounted again. <br />
<br />
He felt the weight come down on him again. Then the familiarity heat of the jack. There was no hesitation, as the meat between its legs found its home in Jeff&#39;s widening black hole. He wanted it to stop, as this was too perverted. But the body&#39;s desires were too overwhelming for Jeff to do anything about it. <br />
<br />
The Jack pressed himself deep in inside Jeff. He could almost feel the thick black male appendage go all the way into his intestines. Jeff&#39;s body braces itself by digging its hooves into the ground as hard as it could, and leaned back into the Jack&#39;s giant stiff pole, as if to try and bury it deeper inside of him. Nearly to his throat! <br />
<br />
A male penis needs something to push against as resistance, in order for the muscles to work for increased blood flow. The natural way for donkeys to have sex, is by having the &quot;bottom,&quot; (usually the female) stand on all fours, and the male (or dominant of the couple) mount the bottom from behind, standing on his two hind legs and &quot;gripping&quot; as best he could around the middle with his two front legs. There really is no other way for equine species, such as Jeff, to mate. <br />
<br />
Considering Jeff is the bottom in a male-on-male pairing, he&#39;s now the submissive one. Once a human at the very apex of life, Jeff is now submissive to a lowly natural-born donkey. He&#39;s not even at the top of his new species, which is already low on the food chain, intelligence, and abilities. And being the bottom, Jeff&#39;s only chance to ejaculate, is to push its own body as hard into his alpha mate as possible in order to create pressure on his prostate from inside. His body instinctual knew what to do. <br />
<br />
As the two male donkeys reached their climax together, Jeff was braying very loudly and obnoxiously from the combination of pain, complete humiliation, and sexual frustration. His donkey dong was as stiff and straight as a flag pole, straining for release. <br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAAWWWWW HHHHHHAAAAWWWW HHHHHHAAAAAAAWWWWW EEERRRRRRRRR HHHHHAAAAAWWWWW!!!&quot; Jeff yelled out as a colorful explosion rocked his brain as he FINALLY achieved release for the first time as a donkey. <br />
<br />
And boy, what a release it was! All these years of fantasizing about the embarrassment, restrictiveness, and baseness of turning into a donkey and experiencing humiliating donkey sex, finally came to fruition! Not a moment after, the Jack immediately came inside of Jeff. Both males pumping for several heart-stopling minutes, as their equine testicles were full of a gallon of thick, rope, donkey seman. <br />
<br />
The deed complete, the jack dismounted Jeff and went right back to its own business. Ignoring Jeff as if he didn&#39;t exist. After all, the donkey that Jeff became was now far beneath that jack. Not even worthy of a second glance from him. Jeff was just a means to an end, and that&#39;s it. He might as well be a worm instead. <br />
<br />
As for Jeff, he thought maybe since he had that experience, his twin would relent and change him back. Jeff was hopeful for the rest of the evening, even as all the farm animals gathered around the community trough before being led inside the stables by the farmer. Jeff&#39;s new owner. <br />
<br />
He instinctually followed the herd. First went the horses. Then the donkeys. The Jack began nipping and angrily braying at Jeff, anytime he came near the trough. Not that he wanted to drink from the same dirty pool of water that horses were drinking from. <br />
<br />
When Jeff thought it was his turn, again, he was turned away by the alpha jack. Apparently, the bulls and cows go before he does. When they were finished, Jeff could finally get the desperate drink he needed. But there was one problem. <br />
<br />
The trough was full of dirty water. Streams of various animals&#39; mucus, and pieces of chewed up cud that came loose from their maths. Jeff wanted to resist, but his body needed water, and he was too mentally and physically exhausted to resist the instincts to drink. And so, Jeff&#39;s head was forced to be lowered, and his long black snout with wide donkey nostrils dipped towards the effluent. He shut his eyes as he lapped up the warm, disgusting water. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t have long to drink, as the farmer and his hands forced him, the last of the animals, into a stable. All resistance gone, Jeff meekly walked towards the space that was reserved for him. His stable was right next to the Jack&#39;s. The site of the stable he was being led to, completed his humiliation. He would even be stored like a farm animal! <br />
<br />
He was led inside, the gate was shut, light turned off, and barn door closed. There was no real room for to turn around. He was stuck, listening to the sounds of the inside of a barn full of animals bedding down for the night. It was dark and lonely. It was strange, hearing the occasional lowing of a cow or bull. And the occasional hoof on wood as an animal shifted somewhere now and then. Jeff&#39;s own hooves making the same clop sound anytime he shifted in his pen. <br />
<br />
He brayed lowly a few times as he tested his right front hoof on the wooden floor, to make sure he didn&#39;t have a hand and that he couldn&#39;t talk. His penis was coming back out due to his thoughts and tests of his donkeydom.  He involuntarily let out a stream of piss below him, and a couple of plops behind him. <br />
<br />
Jeff slowly drifted off to sleep with the shape of his body solidifying on his mind. Hopeful that Geoff would change him back. It was only one day, afterall. He had strange dreams that night...</p>
