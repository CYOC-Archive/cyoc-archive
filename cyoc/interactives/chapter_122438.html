<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan laughed as Rain struggled, jumping awkwardly, trying to snatch the remote out of his hand. Jay laughed too, standing behind her, his eyes glued to her jiggling ass and enormous breasts. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;why does everything feel so off? I have to get the remote back from him!&#39; She continued to jump, her fingers brushing the remote as Dan held it above her, out of her reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rain,&quot; Dan said, laughing slightly, &quot;calm down! I&#39;ll give it back! What&#39;s the big deal?&quot; He felt a stirring in his pants, partly due to his beautiful, busty goth roommate climbing all over him, and partly knowing the power he held over her. He dangled it slightly lower in a mocking gesture, but she took the bait and managed to get a decent grip on it.<br />
<br />
However, due to her decreased upper-body strength and her center of gravity thrown off as a result of her newly enhanced chest, she wasn&#39;t able to pry it out of Dan&#39;s hands. After a moment, a tug-of-war started between the two of them, their fingers running over the casing and controls of the unit. &quot;Give it back, Dan! I NEED it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan didn&#39;t speak, but threw a glance to Jay, motioning with his eyes towards the remote. Jay got the hint, and moved towards the two of them. &quot;Hey, c&#39;mon now, Rain - it&#39;s just a bit of fun.&quot; Jay made his way to try and help pry them apart, grabbing the remote as well. Dan&#39;s hand shifted as Jay got between them, and his finger ran across a button, pressing it down.<br />
<br />
Dan fell backwards, landing on his back. He still had the remote in hand. &#39;What just happened? Jay must have gotten Rain&#39;s hand loose.&#39; He regained his bearings and stood to see Rain and Jay, frozen in place. He looked down at the remote, and saw his finger was still lingered on a button marked &quot;Pause&quot;. Dan&#39;s stood for a moment before a smile came across his face, the possibilities running through his head, as he walked over to the Chronivac and began altering Rain&#39;s settings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see here...those tits are fun, but is she gonna be able to go out in public like that? Maybe something more manageable - E cup, perhaps. Now, let&#39;s see...she&#39;s already hot, but nothing we can&#39;t make some slight improvements on. Plump up those lips, clear any-and-all blemishes, hair just a touch longer, add a bit of volume...&quot; He tweaked and twisted Rain&#39;s physical parameters taking her from beautiful to drop-dead gorgeous. &quot;Now, let&#39;s take a look at the non-tangibles - Mental traits and relationships.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan briefly considered normalizing Rain - how weird would it be to see her turn into a girly-girl, those &quot;bleach-blonde bitches&quot; he&#39;d always heard her complain about? &quot;But then,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;that&#39;s the kind of girl Jay would like. I&#39;ve never dated a goth chick before - much less any girl as hot as Rain. Maybe a live-in goth girlfriend would be fun!&quot; He decided against changing her base personality, but dumbed down her IQ a bit, removed any interest in technology or computers (&quot;Can&#39;t have her messing with the Chronivac!&quot;). He cut down her addiction to nicotine - he loved a chick who smoked, but didn&#39;t want to make out with a chimney. He bumped up her arousal just a tad (from 35% to 45%) and changed her relationship status with him from &quot;platonic friends&quot; to &quot;live-in girlfriend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Awareness is default set to &#39;on&#39; - well, we can&#39;t have her aware of this, right? It would mess with her too much, trying to reconcile all the new information and feelings her body is giving her. Nah, let&#39;s just knock that sucker to &#39;off&#39; - it&#39;ll be easier for her to acclimate to everything.&quot; He toggled the awareness setting to &#39;Off&#39;, and sent the instructions to the remote. He turned to her and Jay, pressing the trigger while pointing the unit directly at Rain. He watched as the physical changes progressed, her breasts shrinking from the ungodly J-Cups to a more realistic E-Cup - still massive, but within the realm of possibility. Her face shifted and morphed just slightly as the changes Dan had entered in took hold. She was still frozen, and Dan was about to unfreeze her and Jay, and enjoy the fruits of his labor...but...<br />
<br />
Dan looked over Jay, just as frozen Rain, and considered. &quot;Well...having Rain around is gonna be great. But, is Jay going to feel like a third wheel? Would that be fair to him?&quot; Dan thought hard about this for a few moments before scanning Jay with the remote, and sitting back down at the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s only one fair way to handle this. Let&#39;s see here... first, let&#39;s change this setting to female. Good...name change to &quot;Jayde&quot;. That&#39;ll keep things easy. 115 pounds, 5&#39;4&quot;, D-Cup breasts. Dark red hair, natural, down to her shoulders. Pale skin, green eyes. Good musculature...great! Now, the non-tangibles.&quot; Dan considered for a second, looking back at Rain. &quot;Two goth chicks? Nah, that&#39;s too much. Girly-girl? Jay likes girls like that, but that&#39;s never really been my cup of tea. Sports nut? Might be fun, but could also be exhausting. Business chick? Too uptight. What to do, what to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan mused for a moment before inspiration struck. &quot;I&#39;ve got it! A hot punk-rock chick! Her and Rain will compliment each other nicely! Let&#39;s see here - let&#39;s change her hair to a short mohawk. Now, some piercings - one on her lip, her eyebrow, her nose. Four in her left ear, three in her right. Tattoos, of course - I&#39;ll just enter in generic and let the Chronivac pick and choose. What else can I choose here?&quot; Dan began scrolling through menus. &quot;Hmmm - likes and dislikes? Let&#39;s see - let&#39;s add a few dimensions to her. Prefers skirts and boots, dislikes sleeves and high necklines. Enjoys daring makeup and hairstyles, dislikes folk music and electronica. Default outfit? Chronivac, I&#39;ll let you choose. Hmm...maybe make her a bit more kinky, slightly dominating. Wouldn&#39;t be a punk girl without a rebellious streak, right? Relationship with me...can I have two live-in girlfriends? Let&#39;s find out!&quot; He smiled as he changed the status from &quot;platonic friend&quot; to &quot;live-in girlfriend&quot; before checking Rain&#39;s and seeing it hadn&#39;t shifted. His smile grew wider. &quot;Okay. Arousal? Let&#39;s go with what Rain had - 45% constant seems okay. Let&#39;s get the awareness set to &#39;off&#39;&quot; - click -  &quot;and export those settings to the remote!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan stood, pointing the remote at the still-frozen Jay and hesitating for just a moment before hitting the trigger. He watched, fascinated and aroused, as Jay reformed into Jayde before his eyes. She was wearing a short denim skirt, fishnet stockings, and four-inch, knee-high boots. She wore a black tank-top that clung to her breasts, revealing a smooth, pale midriff. Her left arm was covered in a sleeve-tattoo, a mess of flowers and vines, and she had a futuristic looking barcode tattooed above her right eye. Her nails were flawlessly painted a glossy black, and a black choker was delicately wrapped around her neck. Her thick lips were painted a deep glossy red that matched her mohawk, and her piercings formed around her face, giving her an exotic, dangerous look.<br />
<br />
Dan stood there for a moment, admiring the two beauties in front of him, before pressing the &quot;Pause&quot; button again, unfreezing them from their stupor. They both shook their heads for a moment, clearing the cobwebs away, before looking up and seeing Dan, the love of their lives, standing before them. &quot;Danny!&quot; Jayde squealed, running over to him and throwing her arms around him. She squeezed her breasts against his chest as she ground her sex against him, looking up into his eyes before taking his tongue into her mouth. They locked lips for several seconds before she withdrew, easing out of his arms and allowing Rain to cut in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel,&quot; Rain said seductively, &quot;welcome home, lover.&quot; She went in for a kiss as well, her left hand drifting down to Dan&#39;s crotch and rubbing his member through his pants. Still lip-locked, she took his hand and led him to the couch, where Jayde was already sitting and waiting on the right-hand side. Rain took the left side, bringing Dan down to the middle, sandwiched between the two of them. Their scents mingling and intoxicating, Dan placed an arm around each of his girls and allowed them to snuggle up close to him, his hard cock straining the fabric of his jeans, as the girls playfully debated who got to &quot;go first&quot;. Dan just smiled and closed his eyes, waiting for them to reach an agreement.</p>
