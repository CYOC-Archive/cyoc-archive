<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Travis gets home with a package at his door with his name on it. The Chronivac 4.0. Travis takes inside, into his room and opens it. He reads the manual and finds out he can change pretty much everything about his life. Travis starts off small but sees so many files full of choices. Looking through the files of transformation, he can even change specific body parts, and that&#39;s where he starts. Travis&#39;s immediately thinks about changing his penis. He always wondered what it would be like to have some animal penis, so he starts by giving himself a canine penis. He begins typing in the settings and scans himself<br />
<br />
Name: Travis McCall<br />
<br />
Sex: Male<br />
<br />
Age: 17<br />
<br />
Sexuality: Homosexuality<br />
<br />
Ready for Change: Y<br />
<br />
Travis clicks on the canine file and selects penis then makes some adjustments. Right as he is about to begin his change, his father comes home and calls to him. &quot;Hey dad.&quot; Travis walks out to see his father. &quot;Hey Travis, did you shower yet?&quot; Travis&#39;s father says. &quot;No I forgot.&quot; Travis replies then heads to his room and into the bathroom. While in his room, Travis starts his change before taking a shower. In the shower, as Travis finishes washing his body, he begins to wash his hair next as he feels an odd sensation around his genitals. He washes away the soap from his hair and face and looks down. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; Travis shouted then covered his mouth realizing he just shouted. &quot;Are you okay Travis?&quot; His father asks opening the bathroom door slightly. &quot;Y-Yeah I&#39;m fine, it&#39;s nothing.&quot; Travis&#39;s father says okay and then closes the door. Travis whispers &quot;Jeez that was close.&quot; And looks back down at his crotch. His penis was completely replaced with a furry sheath similar to a canine, but bigger, along with his balls being bigger and furrier. Travis turns off the shower then begins rubbing his sheath. Slowly, his new knot cock slips out. Very soon, his cock is fully erect and his big, red cock is long and thick. Travis could barely wrap his whole hand around his cock. He began stroking fast and rubs his furry balls. Travis already feels himself about to blow. Travis stopped for a moment, realizing that he&#39;s still in the shower and he knew he would jizz a lot but he already felt it coming, pre shot out on the walls. Thinking fast, Travis shoves his knot into his mouth then cums loads into his mouth, swallowing all of it with few leaking. Very soon he stopped, feeling completely full.<br />
<br />
Travis steps out with his knot leaking while going back into sheath. Travis quickly goes to his room and closes his door. He can feel the cum in his stomach. &quot;Well at least I didn&#39;t make a big mess in the shower for my dad to see.&quot; Travis thought to himself. He looks back into the Chronivac, he wants to complete his canine look. He makes himself a full blown anthropomorphic wolf. As he finishes, he quickly pressed enter and felt the changes begin, fur started to grow all over his body, it feels thick and warm to him. Travis looked all over his body as it changes, fur covering his hands and arms, then to his legs. Travis felt his bones shift in his legs, making him digitigrade. His feet morph into paws to fit his digitigrade legs, along with getting completely covered in fur. He then felt his tail bone pushing out and forming a functional tail. Finally, Travis felt his face shift, he looked into the mirror as it changes, a muzzle began to form, pushing his face forward. Travis has seen werewolf movies and thought it would be painful for something like that to form but he barely felt anything. Very soon, he was a full anthro wolf, tall with white fur and some digitigrade legs along with some nice looking paws. <br />
<br />
Travis felt so different yet he felt like his true self, he loved his new form. Travis looked back to his mirror to get good look at himself. &quot;Huh, not bad, I look amazing, even cute.&quot; Travis said to himself then chuckles. He then puts on some clothes that oddly fit his new form. His pants even had a hole for his new tail. Travis noticed something odd, he has some new clothing he didn&#39;t recognize but obviously belong to him. Picking up a collar he found at the bottom, he shrugged and put it around his neck then went to his mirror to look at himself again. &quot;Heh, looking good.&quot; Travis said to himself again. He looked around the room and wondered what he should do nex... Oh wait here comes his father. &quot;Hey kiddo, I&#39;m going out to have lunch with some friends, you think you&#39;ll be fine on your own?&quot; Travis&#39;s father says as he walks in, Travis is startled but calms to see his father acting normal to his new form. &quot;Sure dad, go have fun.&quot; Travis said with a nervous look. &quot;If you&#39;re gonna invite one your friends, now is the time to tell me before you do it behind my back.&quot; Travis laughs at dad and says. &quot;Yeah I&#39;m inviting someone, how did you know that.&quot; His father chuckles, &quot;Because I know you kid.&quot; They both chuckle as Travis&#39;s father leaves. &quot;Now I wonder who I should invite.&quot; Travis said while picking up his phone.</p>
