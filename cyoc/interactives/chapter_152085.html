<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The arrival at the Jenkins home came quietly. John thanked Ginger again for the tour and waved her off as she made her way out and was soon going down the street to return to her home. He genuinely felt pretty good with his day as things had gone well. He was also glad that Janice had apparently found someone to be friends with. As he came in through the garage, though, he entered a rather quiet house with Harry and Jenny standing in the doorway to the kitchen with Janice standing just in behind them and in front of John. Outside of the light in the laundry room/hallway that they were in and some light that came in from some outside windows there didn&#39;t appear to be any lights on at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; John wondered, &quot;Did your parents go out to dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so, their car is still here,&quot; Harry commented as he looked to Jenny and then over his shoulder to the younger Harpers, &quot;though... I would think they would have started on dinner by now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny read Harry&#39;s eyes pretty clearly as they shifted toward the general direction of the hallway on the far side of the house that would lead to where the bedrooms were. She couldn&#39;t hear anything at the moment and she thought that Henry and Lisa Jenkins might be a bit old for anything sexual, but she supposed with them out for the day... it wouldn&#39;t be impossible. And for the moment, it wouldn&#39;t be her place to critique anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can get started on dinner,&quot; Jenny offered and looked over to her younger sister and brother, who didn&#39;t appear to catch on to the context behind what Harry had said, &quot;why don&#39;t you go check on your parents. They might just be taking a nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry looks strong enough that he wouldn&#39;t need one,&quot; John commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never know though,&quot; Harry quipped and moved forward flipping the kitchen light on as he went, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Harry then made his way deeper into the house. His eyes quickly adjusted as he moved into rooms that had much lower light levels as was hardly troubled by it and as he passed the area where the front door was and then turned into the hallway that lead into the side where the bedrooms were, he could hear some soft chuckles and conversation coming from the deepest part of the house, which had to be his parents&#39; bedroom. In this, he knew they were awake, though for the moment he didn&#39;t know what they were doing. However as he got closer toward the doorway, he carefully tapped his fingertips against the wall of the hallway and stopped short of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom... dad? You two okay?&quot; Harry called, wanting to make sure he wasn&#39;t barging in on anything.<br />
<br />
His answer was to see his mother come into view from within the master bedroom. She was fully dressed, though it was a bit disheveled and Harry&#39;s werefox sense of smell, even in his human form, could pick a scent that he&#39;d never expected to catch on his parents. In this, he knew they&#39;d been having sex. It wasn&#39;t criminal and he knew his parents did love each other, but there was a part of him that sort of felt that that sort of thing would be a bit odd. However, because it wasn&#39;t criminal, Harry decided not to say anything about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re doing great, dear... how was your tour?&quot; Lisa Jenkins said to Harry with a soft smile as Henry soon came out behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It went great... Janice was more interested in the lake and potentially seeing a weremer... but she should know Moon Lake&#39;s main landmarks,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;and John seems to have had a good time with Ginger. They somehow stumbled onto Huck and Betty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was their any problem?&quot; Henry asked, &quot;I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry stepped back to walk back toward the kitchen with his parents following, &quot;I think it was more coincidence than anything else and Huck and Betty seemed fine when they dropped John and Ginger off at the lake. They should have consummated their marriage by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope they&#39;re happy,&quot; Lisa said slowly, &quot;Did you just get back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and surprised that you took the day easy,&quot; Harry answered as now the glow of the electric lights in the kitchen and the background sound of pots and pans being moved reached his ears. Even Henry and Lisa heard them. &quot;Though with it being late... Jenny&#39;s offered to help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... dear... I had things planned!&quot; Lisa practically jumped and hustled forward, passing Harry and moving on into the kitchen, leaving Harry and Henry to follow along behind her.<br />
<br />
She was quick enough to find that Jenny had found box of rice and had that set on the counter with John and Janice sort of moving around as helpers. Most of what they were doing was more organizing things, as if looking for the right sized pot to cook the rice in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does the box say again?&quot; John asked.<br />
<br />
Jenny read the box&#39;s size instructions again, making John and Janice look back to the cupboard they&#39;d been looking through to try and find the pan that would fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be closer to the front on your right side, Janice,&quot; Lisa spoke as she came into the room, getting John and Jenny to turn toward her as she spoke, &quot;sorry that we didn&#39;t have anything ready...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you take a nap?&quot; Janice wondered as she finally retrieved the pot that would be of the right size to cook the rice in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that,&quot; Lisa said slowly noting that John turned back and focused on putting some of the things that he and Janice had pulled out while looking for the pot to be used, &quot;Did you enjoy the tour?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was okay,&quot; Janice answered, &quot;the best part was the lake, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It went well for Ginger and I...&quot; John added, &quot;No walls around the high school... even with all the other stuff going on right now, it seemed safe there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you felt safe with your friend,&quot; Janice corrected for him, &quot;and I made a friend too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa gave a small smile as she came around the counter to assist in the preparation of the dinner that she&#39;d planned for the evening. It was something she&#39;d hopped she&#39;d have had ready earlier if she and Henry hadn&#39;t been distracted for a good portion of the day. While Henry wasn&#39;t in bad shape and neither really was Lisa, they were at an age where that part of their lives just wasn&#39;t as active as it had been when they were younger. But it wasn&#39;t something that had fully died and having Jenny and Harry still at home as married werefoxes, maybe something in that triggered the desire for intimacy, regardless, Lisa had hopped to have dinner ready before now.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, what was planned wouldn&#39;t take too long to cook and Jenny had already found the rice that was intended to be the night&#39;s side dish. There were also some packages of cod filets that were in the refrigerator and she made her way there to get them out, if only to make sure that her help didn&#39;t get ahead of her. Out of the corner of her eye, she watched Harry and Henry move over to sit at the smaller breakfast table that was closest to the window that lead to the backyard.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what friend was this?&quot; Henry wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A wereotter... or he said he was supposed to be one,&quot; Janice answered, &quot;he said his name was Moses Mittleburg. He was out swimming in the lake and was pretty friendly. Said he also goes to the middle school here... I was hoping to meet a weremer, but he was nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s good to hear that you had fun,&quot; Henry commented as he talked over the beeps that came from the oven as Lisa began setting it to preheat. &quot;You&#39;ll have a friend when you start school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded as she moved to sit opposite Henry and while Lisa and Jenny finished up a few things before things reached a point where they&#39;d have to wait awhile before the nest steps were taken. From there, they shared a few tidbits of things that they&#39;d found out on their respective tours of Moon Lake. Henry and Lisa were both pleased to find that despite the present worries, the two younger Harpers had relatively quiet tours of the town and weren&#39;t troubled by anything as they went. That was something that everyone deserved.</p>
