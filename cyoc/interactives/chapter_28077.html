<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jake was just preparing to rough Billy up when the remote went to work. Both boys suddenly felt as if the world were dropping out from under them. Billy yelped in surprise as his point of view rose higher - he was aging and growing accordingly, stopping at twelve years old and about four feet tall. Jake, on the other hand, was shrinking as he became younger, until he was eight years old and no more than two feet, eight inches. Jake stared up at Billy, mouth agape. "P-p-please!" he begged. "Stop it!"</p>
<p>"I'm not doing it!" Billy protested, as a second wave of changes set in. Jake felt a wrenching pain in his gut and genitals began to cry, something he hadn't done in years. Though he couldn't see it and was too wrapped up in his tears to figure it out, Jake  had become medically female. At the same time, Billy felt intrigue and warmth as his abdomen was filled with a kneading sensation, as if invisible hands were shaping his insides into something wonderful, something that could help him shelter and nurture a creature even more helpless than he had been only a few moments before.</p>
<p>Billy felt a soft tingling as her dark brown hair became soft and silky, falling down to just below her shoulders. She changed from bony and lanky to soft and slender, all her corners and joints softening out into the smoothness of a young girl's body, her face going from pasty and thin to rounded and rosy. Jake, meanwhile, felt as though she were touching an electric-fence as her dirty blonde hair changed to a lovely gold and grew down past her waist and almost to her knees. Though she remained chubby, she changed from being chubby because of too many snacks to being chubby with baby fat, which would disappear during puberty, leaving her with a killer figure and sizable breasts.</p>
<p>As Jake and Billy began to catch on to what was happening, one reacting with horror, the other with awe, a wind swept around the two newly-formed girls and a final round of changes set in. Jake's long hair billowed around her, getting in her eyes as the wind stung at her face. Meanwhile, her pants and shirt merged, becoming a full-length white dress, as her boxers shrank and became frilly pink panties, and her grubby sneakers changed into immaculate black pennyloafers. The breeze gently caressed Billy's face, her hair softly brushing against her rosy cheeks, as her pants and shirt became a knee-length but grass-stained blue denim skirt and a plain white blouse. Her tighty-whities altered to become no-frills white panties, and her battered and torn shoes turned into comfortable leather sandals. Then it was over.</p>
<p>Carrie assessed her handiwork from a distance. It was good, she told herself. Billy, she had specified, would be a late bloomer, beginning to develop at fourteen and not finishing until fifteen or sixteen. It would give her time to adjust to being a girl, and when she had finished going through puberty, her combination of approachable beauty and compassionate, gentle personality would make her a surefire hit among the type of guys who saw women as something other than sex objects. She was sure to have a happy life as a mother and wife, provided for by a loving husband. Jake, on the other hand, would hit menarche at twelve and develop her figure by thirteen. From then until middle age she'd be a smoking hottie, pursued by every single male in the region, but Carrie expected that with the warped concept of masculinity Jake clearly posessed, she'd be unable to learn to have a happy relationship with a member of the opposite sex. Carrie smiled sadistically. Justice had been more than served, and she'd gotten to thoroughly screw someone's life up in the process. Her work here was done, and she wandered off to look for something else to do.</p>
<p>Billy stood there, looking herself over, slowly realizing what had happened. <i>I'm a girl,</i> she thought. <i>This is...what will Mom say? Is she going to be upset?</i> She began to feel afraid, but something within calmed her. <i>No,</i> she thought, <i>why would she be upset? What's wrong with being a girl? It...it means boys aren't allowed to hit me, and I don't have to do football like Dad was talking about...does this mean I'll get to grow up to be a mother? That's okay for girls, isn't it? Maybe I can have kids and take care of them. I'd be a good mother; I wouldn't let anybody beat up my kids. I think I'd like that.</i></p>
<p>"Bobbi?" came her mother's voice. "Roberta May Jordan, where have you got off to?" <i>Wow,</i> Billy/Bobbi realized, <i>does Mom think I've always been a girl?</i> "Coming, Mom," she called, and ran off to greet her mother.</p>
<p>"Goodness," her mother said, "look at you! You've gone and gotten more grass stains on that skirt! Silly girl, it's a good thing those are your playclothes. Oh well, it's not like I wasn't a tomboy when I was your age. Come on, it's time to go home."</p>
<p>As Bobbi and her mother walked off, Jake stood there, shocked and horrified. <i>This can't be right!</i> her mind screamed at her. <i>I...I turned into a girl! A little girl! This can't be right, I'm supposed to be a boy, not a girl! Maybe...maybe...if I ask Mom, could she help me?</i> She ran around the corner to where her mother was sitting on a park bench, reading a parenting magazine. "Mom!" she cried. "Mom, you've got to help me!"</p>
<p>Her mother looked up, concerned. "What is it," she asked. "What's wrong, dear?"</p>
<p>"I was...I was playing with this other boy," she lied, "and...and suddenly we both turned into girls! Please, Mom, how can I get turned back into a boy? Do you know?"</p>
<p>"Now, Jenny," her mother sighed, "we've been over this before. These stories you make up are just plain silly. You know perfectly well you're a girl, not a boy. Moreover, you're growing up into a young lady, and I expect you to act like one. That means dropping this nonsense about being a boy, understand?"</p>
<p>Jake/Jenny couldn't believe her ears - her mother thought she'd always been a girl! "But Mom," she began, but her mother cut her off. "But nothing," she said, sternly.. "<i>Drop it.</i> I don't want to hear another <i>one</i> of these stories of yours, young lady. Now come on, we're going home."</p>
<p>Jenny gaped. Her mother was serious - she didn't believe that Jenny used to be a boy, and she was telling her not to talk to her about it anymore! And when Jenny's mother used that tone, Jenny knew she meant business. Her mother took her by the hand and led her towards the car.</p></p>
