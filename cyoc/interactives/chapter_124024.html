<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;For your transformation, you will transform into a random fetish at random times. One moment, you could be a normal girl, the next, you will become a random fetish. the time you will transform will be random, but will always be more that an hour apart. Also, anyone who has sexual intercourse with you will adopt this same kind of transformation. For your dare, I dare you to have sex with at least one person a month. Bye!&quot; and Kyle hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a dick.&quot; Jen said, looking for the rest of her clothes. Once she got her cheerleading top and shoes on, she walked out the house and headed to the bus stop. As she waited, she started getting a warm sensation all over her body. that warm sensation turned into a hot sensation as she waited. Then, her phone went off with a message alert. &quot;Notice: A blown pipe has caused damage to school property. School is cancelled until further notice.&quot; &quot;Thank god, maybe I can change into something cooler.&quot; she said, fanning her face with her notebook. Why was she so hot? Literally, of course. Back in her house, she tore off her long sleeved undershirt, cheerleading top, shoes, and long socks, leaving her in her pink bra and skirt. But she was still hot. Then the heat subsided. She was relieved. For a moment, she thought she was cursed. She sat down on her couch and contemplated her ideas for the rest of the day. Her stomach was feeling a bit bloated. Maybe something she ate. Her stomach felt more and more bloated as time went on. She paid no attention to the fact that her belly was now starting to turn into a pretty prominent globe. She sat, absentmindedly, looking at her phone, looking up things to do. It wasn&#39;t until she was getting up to go to the bathroom that she noticed her balloon belly. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!?&quot; she screamed, dropping her phone. She became acutely aware of a feeling of her belly being inflated with air like a balloon. She gave her belly a smack, and got a resonating  rubber ball sound back. The inflation process sped up, filling her faster and larger. She ran to her door to get out before she couldn&#39;t fit. it was a tight squeeze, but she made it out, and ran behind her house to her large backyard, where she would have room to not only grow, but assess her situation. As she ran out back, her belly bounced up and down. She noticed that her jumps were getting longer and higher. She tried jumping straight up and jumped nearly 5 feet. &quot;Oh, no!&quot; Jen said in a high voice. Her belly was being inflated with helium. She grabbed a rope, tied it to a fence post, tied the other end around her foot as a precaution, and braced for the worst.<br />
<br />
Her inflation was taking a turn. Not only was her belly about as big as an over inflated excersize ball, but her whole body was starting to take on a certain roundness. The rotund mass that was her balloon belly was taking over her body, as her arms and legs were also being inflated. Her body was rapidly inflating. one moment, she was the size of an exercise ball, the next, she was almost as large as a bathroom. Her breasts were pretty much absorbed into her ballooning body. Eventually, she started to float. she lifted up and up, first an inch or two, then a full foot. As she inflated, she rose into the sky. Once she hit 15 feet, she ran out of rope and floated up there as a big human balloon. However, her inflation wasn&#39;t done. She kept inflating, and it was a pretty fast rate. she nearly doubled in size within a few seconds. she was starting to look like a blimp, and was getting bigger. She kept inflating, bigger and bigger, rounder and rounder. finally her inflation ceased. Her Final size was pretty big, about the size of an exercise ball about 20 times bigger than normal. she sat up there, helplessly. she still couldn&#39;t find the reason anyone could find this sexy. About a few hours later, she felt another hot sensation. it took a bit before this subsided, but when it did, her deflation began. Helium escaped from her ass, propelling her forward, and because she was on a rope, she spun and flew around her backyard. within a minute, she was back to normal, and on the ground. She untied her rope and ran back inside to put some clothes back on. However, her warmsensation came back, as she was going to transform again.</p>
