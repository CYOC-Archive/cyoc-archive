<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Handling the morning rush was a bit hectic for Richard Van Direstag, but he managed and made sure that Rachel and Rob made it to the high school and on time. Some of that he chalked up to a great many things in Moon Lake making the Van Direstag&#39;s lives &quot;hectic.&quot; The town and its were secret, and the Mandatory Were Law that protected it, were all things that floored him the Town Chancellor reported those issues to him on the first weekday the family had in Moon Lake. Things like that were not things that Richard remembered seeing anywhere else in his life. Every place might have its quirks, but having a town run by weres and that one member of his family HAD to join them was not something he&#39;d consider a &quot;normal&quot; quirk, and privately, it was something that could be done away with.<br />
<br />
He was also a bit uneasy as he pulled the Van Direstag van into the parking lot at the college administration building with Frank by his side in the front passenger seat. The prior day he&#39;d gotten into a bit of an argument with one of the admissions secretaries over the were secret and the Mandatory Were Law, largely with the hope that the college could counter the city and provide an exemption to the law and when that failed he got a bit more aggressive with the secretary. Much of that interaction carried a lot of the sense of &quot;I&#39;ll never be a were&quot; sort of tone to it, and that ended up being proven wrong by the end of that night. And while Richard didn&#39;t like the Mandatory Were Law, he also knew that he&#39;d put his foot in his mouth with how he&#39;d behaved and would likely deserve any commentary on his aggression and then becoming a werelion that evening.<br />
<br />
Richard hadn&#39;t intended on becoming a were, but in his responses in trying to avoid his family being changed by a law he didn&#39;t like or support, he had ended up in an argument with Rose and she pushed him into going out into the woods and getting first hand knowledge on weres rather than &quot;going off the wall.&quot; That only lead to him stumbling onto the werelioness, Shelia Wiggleston, and getting a dose of were from her. It was an accident, but it still made him become a were as well, and that lead to its own problems. Namely when he began to feel werelion instincts get the better of him and that upset Rose, which lead to Rose getting attacked by a mundane Mountain Lion. In this, Richard knew he&#39;d have a lot to apologize for, both to the love of his life and with regard to the college for his own actions. He could only hope that the college wouldn&#39;t take his actions out on Frank as the two came in to transfer Frank from online learning to in class learning before going to the hospital to pick up Rose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll forgive you if you apologize for anything you might have done to agitate the staff,&quot; Frank said to him from the passenger seat of the van, making Richard look over to his son.<br />
<br />
Frank was seated calmly and with to some extent a thoughtful look on his face, though Richard also guessed that Frank might have his own judgement that he&#39;d kept to himself, for he was fairly certain that Frank had heard at least parts of the argument that lead to his becoming a were and Rose being wounded by a mundane animal. It was one of those things where the more Richard thought back on it, the more he realized he could have done things better and smarter. Richard didn&#39;t change his mind on what he saw of the law, but he had to know that things would be easy given how he&#39;d interacted before, and Frank likely knew that. Frank probably wasn&#39;t going to win any academic awards, but he wasn&#39;t stupid, and Richard was certain his eldest son had paid enough attention to know the general situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Richard nodded as he got out and then shut the door, and hitting the automatic lock on the key as he and Frank then made their way to the building, &quot;but there is a lot things that I did yesterday that weren&#39;t my smartest... things that irritated the college, irritated your mother, got me turned into a were, got your mother hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said the hospital said that mom was going to be okay,&quot; Frank pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Physically, yes,&quot; Richard nodded, &quot;but not all the damage was physical... and that will take time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still... just be open and apologize,&quot; Frank advised, &quot;it&#39;ll make things easier. Especially since now that we&#39;re here... and the Mandatory Were Law technically isn&#39;t an issue anymore... if you are indeed a were, now, there should be no other problem. We can then transfer things over for me from the online learning to in class learning... which we were expected to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nodded and they slowly made their way into the building. This was a big part of what had brought them to Moon Lake in the first place, and Frank&#39;s education was important. And while Frank wasn&#39;t stupid, neither was he going to be a great academic or a high tier athlete, and with the Van Direstag family having three children that were in their teens, Richard and Rose needed things like scholarships and Moon Lake College was the only one that was willing to give Frank a scholarship. It meant a move, but when the decision was first made, Richard felt it was worth it for Frank&#39;s future. All things were related aside, that was now where he and Frank were up to for the moment. The college had initially allowed Frank to follow classes online while Richard and Rose closed their business in Ann Arbor and prepared to move the family, but now that they were in Moon Lake, Frank would be expected to attend classes in person.<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully we&#39;re at the right building for that,&quot; Richard said slowly, &quot;for I&#39;m sure there may be some papers they&#39;ll expect both of us to sign to go from online to in person learning... or at least acknowledging your arrival... Though if I&#39;m wrong... that may have you go through your academic advisor and have him set about all the schedule changes and where you will go...&quot;<br />
<br />
They made their way in quietly and with Richard still feeling some sense of unease, and that didn&#39;t ease up as the admissions secretary came into view as he and Frank entered the building. She looked at him with some sense of suspicion and surprise, at first, but said nothing as the two men approached the counter that was at the front of the admissions area to the building. For the moment, Richard and the secretary traded a few short stares to the other, which left an awkward silence as Frank looked between them. Eventually Richard spoke and broke the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still against the idea of the Mandatory Were Law,&quot; Richard spoke to begin, &quot;but... I must apologize for causing you any disruption in your day yesterday... I was desperate to save my family took things a little too far in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally a lot of new residents are rather hesitant about things related to the Mandatory Were Law when they first arrive in Moon Lake,&quot; the secretary answered, &quot;often because of how different Moon Lake is from the rest of the country. The most we can ask new residents is to get to know Moon Lake and its people BEFORE making any decision on things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or one will make other mistakes,&quot; Richard sighed, &quot;which is what led to my... joining were society, but that&#39;s something else... and not why I&#39;m here today.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was some relief that the secretary didn&#39;t decide to make any point on things that happened the day before, but Richard didn&#39;t want to show any more embarrassment that he had with the issue than he already did, as there were plenty of other things that he&#39;d likely have to do as a new werelion, and other things that he&#39;d have to do as a loving husband because of what happened to Rose after he became a werelion. Richard hoped that he and Frank could conduct their business quickly before going to the hospital to pick up Rose when they discharged her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are you here for, today?&quot; the secretary asked.<br />
<br />
Richard then gestured to Frank, &quot;this is my son, Frank. He was accepted to college here... though because of certain financial considerations, he couldn&#39;t be here in August when the year started. And admittedly, this came before all the were stuff... but the admissions office did offer a deal that would let Frank take his courses online until we arrived. Now that we&#39;re all settled in... and fighting over the Mandatory Were Law is pointless... given that I am a were now... we are here to see about arranging for the transfer to in class learning, which your office also said Frank would have to do. Though... I&#39;m a bit unaware of what procedures you may have. Is there paperwork to sign or anything like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The secretary looked over to Frank, &quot;and your full name, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank Van Direstag,&quot; Frank answered, leaving out his middle name. It was doubtful that there would be other &quot;Van Direstags&quot; in Moon Lake besides his own family, and as such he didn&#39;t think his middle name would be that relevant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I will have to transfer you over to the head of the admissions department, as she may know more on your specific case,&quot; the secretary spoke, &quot;though, I would think that in general some of this would go over to your assigned academic advisor... who will be one of the regular staff members here at the college. But given the uniqueness of your case... that transition may be... different. Hold on a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair watched as the secretary got up and then walked back toward a door that was on the wall behind  the area where the secretary was seated. There was some soft conversation that followed. Richard could hear just enough to know that there was conversation, but not enough to know exactly what was said. They waited semi patiently, with Richard&#39;s foot soon softly tapping on the floor with thoughts of Rose and her health and comfort also on his mind. It was something that made him wish he&#39;d been more patient and calm with things earlier as it set up the present situation they were in. After a few moments, the secretary returned with another woman following. They moved around to one edge of the counter area on the north side of the area and beckoned Richard and Frank to approach them. Richard thought he recognized the other woman&#39;s face, but wasn&#39;t quite sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Winifred Herd,&quot; the secretary spoke as she gestured to the other woman, &quot;She&#39;s the present admission&#39;s head. She would be the one who would be able to handle more of the details that would relate to your case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard slowly nodded as the woman then extended a hand to Richard and then to Frank. They both shook hands with Winifred and Richard got the scent of weredog on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;&#39;m sorry it took things so long to get things in order...&quot; Richard said slowly as he looked to Winifred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re both here now,&quot; Winifred answered, &quot;come with me and we can handle all that you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard and Frank soon followed as they walked around some of the desks that extended westward from the counter that separated main entry area from the areas where the admission staff were working. They then came to door that the secretary had entered through and Winifred held it open for both Frank and Richard. She ushered them in and they were lead into a fairly well furnished office space. The internal walls were painted white, but there were some framed photos that were on the walls. Looking at one, Richard noted that it was in black and white and showed a woman dressed in what would be considered &quot;appropriate&quot; in the late 1800s. The most striking thing was the woman&#39;s face was identical to Winifred&#39;s. There was a bookshelf that was along the west wall and ended right before a window. The frame for it was actually stone, which gave the indication that the white painted walls was something installed later as part of a renovation. As Richard and Frank sat down into a pair of leather chairs that were in front of the large but rather simple wooden desk, Winifred came around behind them and then moved to the other side of the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... your case is unique, as most of our students haven&#39;t had moving accommodations needed before,&quot; Winifred spoke, &quot;and given that we are now in November, we can&#39;t just transfer you over to an academic adviser and let them handle that transition. Partially because they&#39;re now busy with classwork and some preparations for what will be standard advising sessions that will occur next month before the Fall Semester finals and Christmas break. There is also the fact that the college did loan you a laptop to handle the online learning as part of the agreement worked out between yourself, Mr. Van Direstag and the members of the admissions staff you met with during your son&#39;s college tour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard slowly nodded. He and Frank had been working on college applications through much of his eldest son&#39;s Junior to Senior years in High School in order to get the paperwork filled out and who would offer scholarships. Some of this was done online and some of this was done by paper, and Moon Lake College proved to be the only one that would seriously offer Frank a scholarship that was worth taking and had some programs that Frank had found interesting. Thus, shortly before Frank&#39;s Senior Year in High School began, he and Frank had toured the campus and looked it over. During that meeting, Richard got a look at the campus, learned of Moon Lake&#39;s odd layout, and was able to explain some of the economic issues that the Van Direstag family faced that would limit when Frank could physically arrive on the college&#39;s campus for classes. Thankfully, the people Richard had met with seemed willing to make some accommodations, provided Frank did take up in person attendance before the college hit their Thanksgiving break. <br />
<br />
Even at that time, things seemed reasonable. Thus when Moon Lake accepted Frank&#39;s application, that required one brief visit when the summer started while Rose started readying things back in Michigan to arrange the move in order to pick up the laptop that would be needed and get the assorted college log in codes that would be required for taking the classes online. Now, though, that would likely change. For as Frank transitioned into in person classes and didn&#39;t need the laptop, the college would expect it returned and if he needed a computer... the college would have labs for use for students and the Van Direstag&#39;s family computer could handle things like essays and other related school material.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I must first ask... do you still have the laptop?&quot; Winifred asked to Frank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and it&#39;s in good shape,&quot; Frank answered and then looked down for a moment, &quot;though, I don&#39;t have it on me right now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... you&#39;ll have to bring that in tomorrow then,&quot; Winifred sighed, &quot;as we&#39;ll need to make sure it&#39;s in good condition...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that,&quot; Frank promised, to which Winifred nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there any papers we need to sign?&quot; Richard asked, &quot;given that you had to arrange special deals for Frank&#39;s start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so long as the laptop is returned in good condition,&quot; Winifred answered, &quot;the thing that we&#39;ll need to establish here is on what classes you&#39;re taking precisely. As while the online lessons can let you follow your schedule as needed or as you can complete them... but in classes, you&#39;ll need to be on the campus at specific times for them. I can access that here with my computer and print out your class schedule for you... but I&#39;d need your student registration number.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank nodded and recited the number, as it was also part of the log in process for the college&#39;s issued laptop. Winifred nodded and shifted over to her computer. Richard and Franck couldn&#39;t see much more than the back of the screen, but they could hear the clicking as Winifred typed in the numbers. After a few moments, that came up and Winifred looked across the desk to Richard and Frank. The two could hear more mouse clicks as Winifred carried on a few other operations to print the schedule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m printing out the schedule that will go for you, young Mr. Van Direstag,&quot; Winifred spoke, &quot;So you&#39;ll know which classes to go on what days and I can send out the emails to your professors to expect you to appear in person starting tomorrow. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Frank answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... I trust you did order your books over the summer?&quot; Winifred then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Richard spoke, &quot;Though, we were also told that the college couldn&#39;t mail them... at best they&#39;d hold them in storage at the campus book store until the Christmas break...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they should still be there,&quot; Winifred assure him, &quot;You&#39;ll just need to go there and pick them up and from there, things should be on their way. If not... come back here and let me know. My office will then try to get to the bottom of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Frank will be allowed in?&quot; Richard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, since he&#39;s already been accepted, your son would be allowed into his classes,&quot; Winifred answered, &quot;most of this is just to make sure that the details around his specific case are relayed to his professors that he can now attend his classes in person... from there the rest is up to you. Since you also filled out forms that would indicate that your son would be staying at home... and by that the new home you bought in Moon Lake... and thus on campus living would not be needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard gave a smile at that. There may have been some things about this mission that had him uneasy, particularly at the start, but he could not argue with the results so far.</p>
