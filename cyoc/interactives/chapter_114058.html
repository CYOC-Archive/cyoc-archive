<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A toilet can be heard flushing as a large were-lion slowly walks out of the washroom holding onto an I.V stand as he heads back to his bed.<br />
“Oh that felt good,” Peter purring as he slowly sat on the hospital bed; wincing as the wound on his abdomen is still healing.<br />
“I’d imagine,” Leon chuckling as he watches his son sit on his bed; “although, I’ve never had the pleasure of a catheter inserted in me up to my bladder.”<br />
“I don’t recommend it,” Peter jokingly remarks; “it would stifle the urge to plow mom.”<br />
“I don’t think Regina is going to be in a rutting mood when I return home,” Leon grumbling; “not after what I said last night.”<br />
“Just give mom a fresh buck to feast on,” Peter answering flatly; “that will put you back in her good books.”<br />
“I think I have a better idea,” Leon shaking his head; “I surprise mom by dragging you home by your mane.”<br />
“And delay your son’s recovery,” a woman entering the room; “I highly advise against it.”<br />
<br />
Both Peter and Leon turn their heads to see Peter’s Doctor, Helen Tompkins standing at the door. The tall voluptuous woman in a long white doctor’s coat sporting a clipboard and wearing simple flats. Walking towards her patient Peter Talbot; the were-lion could only stare and roar seductively as he immediately sported a raging hard on.<br />
“You could always do a house call or two,” Peter rumbling as he inhales the doctor’s seductive were-rabbit scent.<br />
“You really are horny,” Helen looking at Peter’s throbbing feline member and feeling a longing deep within her loins; a strong desire to be impaled and seeded by the large predator before her. Composing herself, despite the damp feeling between her legs; the doctor looks at her patient with her usual steely demeanor, “as a were-lion you still need at least another day of recovery.”<br />
“Now that my son’s catheter is out,” Leon speaking up; “will he be able to be on solid foods?”<br />
“We’ll start with oatmeal,” Doctor Tompkins making a note on her clipboard; “or do you prefer Jell-O?”<br />
“Oatmeal,” Peter responding before giving a devilish grin; “and you in bed next to me.”<br />
“Peter,” Leon shaking his head and looking embarrassed; “now is not the time to try and seduce a woman. Let the doctor do her job,” Leon then smirks; “then try and hunt her down afterwards.”<br />
<br />
Doctor Helen Tompkins snorts and rushes out of the room, feeling embarrassed. Getting out of ward that Leon was in; Helen breathes hard and heavy as if she just had an intense run. Her heart pounding like a jackhammer and her whole body breaking out in a cold sweat. The lingering scent of Peter Talbot still overwhelming her olfactory senses; putting the were-rabbit in a state of arousal. Her heat cycle despite taking her were-birth control pills clearly not helping as she placed a hand down her trousers; feeling her panties soaked and her sex swollen and open, demanding a hard veiny shaft to milk.<br />
<br />
“Dam this heat I’m in. I need a cold shower,” Helen gasping as she rushes to the staff change room; “something to kill the thoughts of that were-lion claiming me.”<br />
Little does Helen know however, she met her future mate and that their first truly romantic moment will come very soon.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Back in the hospital room, Peter was raising his muzzle to the air; taking deep breaths through his leonine nose while letting his maw remain open.<br />
“What you smelling is a female were’s heat,” Leon looking at his son; “it’s what happens when they are not sexually active.”<br />
She smells so good,” Peter growling while looking at his father; “Helen is mine.”<br />
“Don’t growl at me son,” Leon looking cross; “you maybe letting your lion out a little more than usual but that doesn’t mean I won’t hesitate to let you know who is alpha of our family.”<br />
<br />
Leon just watches his son glare at him before sulking back in his bed; sighing as he looks at his phone for the first time to see the message his wife left him last night Leon knew he had to head home eventually to face his wife’s wrath for growling at her and ordering her to back down.<br />
‘I may be king of the pride,’ Leon looking melancholy; ‘but its Regina that is the true ruler of our family.’<br />
<br />
“Peter,” Leon getting up; “before I leave I want you to know something. I had a dream as I slept last night,” Leon placing a hand on his son’s furry body; “I had a talk with the strange man who you described to me as some kind of misty dragon. He told me,” Leon silencing Peter from speaking up; “he told me that the price for saving your life is that you need to fight me to be the next king of the pride. Apparently most of the pride will see you holding the paw of a were-rabbit as a sign of weakness. Wresting control in a physical confrontation will be the only way to prove the pride wrong.”<br />
“I don’t care,” Peter answering; “I know Helen is the one for me.”<br />
“I know,” Leon looking thoughtful; “but most will look at the sight of a predatory based were mating with a non-predatory were as taboo.”<br />
“Cross-species relationships between weres,” Peter looking at his father; “is not uncommon. Look a Jean and her lover Nate.”<br />
“A werewolf and a were-lioness,” Leon responding; “two predatory based weres that are considered apex predators for the respective environments their animal halves are native too. I’m certain your aunts and uncles won’t object to Nate with your sister.”<br />
“But you think they’ll object to me with a were-rabbit,” Peter looking at his father; “isn’t that racist?”<br />
“Sadly,” Leon sighing; “yes it is. Just be certain this is the path you want to walk before you open the door. You know your mother and I will be there with you,” Leon smiling; “I just can’t say that for the rest of the family and the pride.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
The sounds of moaning and heavy breathing could be heard from the woman’s change room at the hospital. The sound of a shower head on full blast could not dampen the sounds coming from the woman behind the curtain. Helen Tompkins, with one hand cupping her genitals and the other bracing herself on the wall; she was busy plunging two fingers into her slick snatch, furiously  trying to quell the desire her entire body is screaming for. Unable to get the image of Peter’s throbbing leonine cock from her head; even after the many orgasms she has brought herself to. The current orgasm surging through her causing her knees to buckle; falling to the wet tiles the feeling of being sated denied yet again.<br />
<br />
The desire to feel Peter in her was too strong for the were-rabbit doctor. Despite it being unprofessional; she the doctor and he the patient, Helen struggles to get up on shaky knees to shut the cold shower off. Grabbing a large towel to maintain some modesty as she dries off and puts on the bare minimum of clothing; Helen Tompkins composes herself.<br />
<br />
Leaving the change room wearing nothing but a pair of pants and her long doctor’s coat ensuring nothing is revealed. The rough fabric brushing on her nipples; simulating Helen and causing her to gasp and quiver as her arousal heats up yet again.<br />
“I can’t take it anymore,” She cries; “I need him in me, but he is a were-lion and I’m a were-rabbit.”<br />
Walking down the corridors doing her best to act professional; yet feeling like a mare in estrus, Helen arrives at the ward Peter was recovering in. Seeing his father leave the room and speaking to the two large men guarding the door. Grabbing Peter’s chart form the nurses desk, Helen heads back to Peter’s room and re-enters. The guards knowing who she is, letting her enter unmolested; Helen closes and locks the door to see Peter looking at her.<br />
<br />
Helen gives Peter a look of a hunter who just found and killed their quarry. Removing her white coat to expose her large double D breasts and slipping off her flats; Helen watches as Peter’s barbed prick eagerly rises from its protective sheath as she stands stock still while Peter places his large paws on her body as it rapidly sprouts grey and white fur. Helen the were-rabbit, letting Peter rip her pants off as he carries her to his bed; her sex gushing and spurting lubricating juices as she watches the were-lion climb on top of her, moaning as she gladly spreads her legs eager to feel Peter fill her.<br />
<br />
******* <br />
<br />
Helen gasped as she pinches her clitoris; with her hand still down her pants now getting soaked by the erotic daydream she just had. The were-rabbit rushing to the medical staff change rooms to clean up; her aroused scent of being in heat following her as she quickly runs to the safety of a comforting cold shower.</p>
