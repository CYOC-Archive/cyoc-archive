<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being the 2500ft Giant was incredibly hard. His wealth from his acting and sponsor rolls were constant but he missed the amenities that normal people took for granted. He was So big he had to take baths in the ocean and tan out on a long enough stretch of beach for days. nowhere on the Giant Land Estate was out of prying eyes mostly because he couldn&#39;t build anything he didn&#39;t outgrow the next few months. His last attempt for shelter was carving a mountain hovel he barely fit into to sleep under. Sometimes he wished that he just used the shrink option instead but he went about this life too long to remember how it felt being a minuscule 6&#39; 2&quot;! Not fitting to anything has been how he has been living for the last few years. He reached for the tiny laptop pressing the same keys he has always. He was done living by society&#39;s restraints! HE WANTED TO GROW. Struggling with his bulbous arms he accidentally played an old interview he did with a news anchor where he said he’s not sure why he has these large growth spurts that get increasingly more intense each time. He almost wanted to laugh. 3 years ago, He side was that interview really 3 years ago? He wanted more! Closing the video tab, he then returned to Transformation.net. inputting the commands for growth. His body shook as he glued his computer onto his neck muscle. Interestingly from the corner of his eyes, he saw a different option selected. He chalked it up as his hyperactive mind playing tricks on him. Relaxing in his pen that was Giant Land USA. He awaited his next growth. He’s been cleanly shaven for so long. He wondered how the puny world will react to the behemoth of America!<br />
He woke up to a pleasant tickling. Seeing a mat of hair on his chest he realized the hair option was enabled again laughing. He disabled the setting and calmly returned to sleep. A sudden shaking suddenly reawakens him. Ben wasn’t sure what that sound was. Everything was warm, but also Dark? Trying to readjust to the darkness he realized he couldn’t see anything. He tried feeling his chest hairs brushing up his face he suddenly realized what was going on. He tried moving his arms. But for some reason his arms felt slow and heavy. Wait no he didn’t even feel his arms. Panicking he tried to get his bearings in the dark. His pecs pushed further on something? He wasn’t sure. Trying to push his pecs out with is willpower alone proved difficult. Every time he thought of flexing his body would convulse. Expanding in all direction he presumed but he felt nothing except the mass around his head. He tried finding the laptop around him but now all he can see is the fleshy growths of his muscle. Everything felt HEAVY.  All of a sudden a ringing was heard. Realizing his phone was still reachable head-butted the call button. On the other side was his director, “Hey Ben I didn’t expect you to be visiting the studio today?” Confused. Ben tried to speak. All he could hear was grunts and moans coming out of him. Trying to focus on speaking he was able to murmur one word “G-R-o-W!” His voice was so foreign to Ben. The Director suddenly grew deathly quiet. “Ben how far away are you from your home?” “H-O-M-E?” “M-E HOME?” “oh… We have a problem Ben.” Ben connected the thoughts but only the director was able to express it. “I can see you from all the way here bud!” stunned Ben was suddenly able to move his body. He started to expand in every direction rapidly. The Director lines was cut. A sudden rush of pain was felt from Ben as he roared. His body stretching for miles. He tried the sun broke and he could see tiny planes zooming around him. The puny cities around him. And in the distance he could see the computer at the peak of is third pecs. Trying to move his arm, he couldn’t even see the arms he could feel it’s slow ascent. Eventually he clicked the options off. He still felt like he was burning. Surprisingly not hungry he tried to recollect his thoughts. He must be standing right? 18,000ft ridiculous he thought! But then he realized something he couldn’t feel his feet on the ground. Almost instinctively the Giant tried to stand. Quickly the planes receded from view as he continued to soar higher and higher. The rush of air was so intense he almost fell over but knowing that if he did accidentally fall over he would probably cause a world-ending catastrophe he regained his balance. Still feeling incredibly hot still he tried to survey the receding horizon around him. He could see the Earth’s curve. Freaking out he accidentally flexed causing him to lose balance as he once again grew heavy. Force to sit down again he could feel his head rushing further and further up. He decided to let all the heat escape. Completely tensed up he moved himself to the ocean until he feel deep into the challenger trench. Getting submerged in water felt incredibly good he wasn’t sure how to felt as he was passed by Mauna Kea which he towered over. The tallest volcano in the world slightly shorter than he was. The whole ocean only lapped around his lower abs. Unfortunately, a rocked force him to flex causing the water to rush past his head downwards. Angrily he re-ascended to the ocean floor watching as the puny world continued to shrink before him. The Ocean barely felt good anymore. The water was now barely lapping above his quads as they stood. He still felt warm. So he continued to flex. Growing and Growing. Eventually, the feeling of lapping water became minuscule. Under his knees, ugh. He tried to move carefully across the earth. Making sure he didn’t displaced by tsunami level waves on the microscopic world around him. With 6 giant footsteps, he was back on land after navigating the ocean first. Fuck his feet crushed the fence surrounding his pen. So puny. With one last angry burst he grew one last time. The computer ringed informing the Giant his stats. <br />
