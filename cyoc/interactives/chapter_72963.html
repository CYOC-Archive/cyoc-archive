<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
You had a mix excitement and nervousness as you and Hank made your way into the rainforest that bordered the warehouse Hank Pym's company owned and used in the area. The excitement came from the likely prospect of completing the colony by nightfall. Hank would soon be a drone ant sufficiently big enough to mate with you, and after that was done, you would be well on your way to laying eggs. It wasn't how you envisioned your life, but then no one actually had their lives go exactly according to plan. You didn't plan on becoming an ant queen, but it still happened. Your colony wanted you to fulfill that role, and wouldn't back down from their position. You accepted the idea only if the drone they wanted for you was transformed willingly, which Hank Pym seemed eager to do. And while you would try to make sure your colony never threatened humanity, you were excited for what would come after Hank's transformation.<br />
<br />
What had you nervous, though, was Doctor Benjamin. He seemed to be another scientist working for the same company that Hank worked for, but unlike Hank, who seemed eager to join the colony and more then willing to keep the fact that you were human a secret, Doctor Benjamin was not as trustworthy as far as you were concerned. He seemed to interrogate both Hank and you when you had arrived, and the only way to get him to back off was to let him know that you were human. You were now fairly certain that Doctor Benjamin was now reporting what Divine Fire Ant venom did, at least to animals with a backbone anyway. The colony had said that their venom only transformed vertebrates. You didn't recall them saying anything about invertebrates. But still, humans would not respond well to this revaluation, and you were certain that if you stayed where Doctor Benjamin could keep an eye on you, you'd never get your drone, your colony would never thrive, and you would pay for your own transformation with your life.<br />
<br />
The best solution that you had was to get as far away from the warehouse as possible. Once in the jungle and sufficiently far enough away, you could begin laying eggs and enlarge your colony. Your daughters could then provide you and your colony with safety. They might even be able to explore the rainforest, maybe find other Divine Fire Ant colonies that had come from human stock originally. After all, your colony spoke of legends along those lines, and you were their real life version of their legends, and Hank had said that the people in the area revered the Divine Fire Ant. Finding their colonies and exchanging ideas and information on how they survived and kept hidden would be big. But that was still in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, my Queen,&quot; one of the drones said from below you, &quot;this is home. This is nature. This is where we belong.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked around as you walked on your six legs, antennae moving to catch smells and pick up any potential vibrations that might mean a threatening presence was approaching you. At the moment there was nothing, and you were overcome by all of the green around you. In a strange way, it did feel like home to you, with the tall trees, the bushes, the ferns, and all the other plants. So long as humans didn't chop down the forest, it'd be home for a very long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you said back to the drone, &quot;this does feel like home.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then turned to Hank Pym and stopped. You had now moved among the trees and bushes and likely wouldn't be easily seen from the warehouse. You figured it was now time for him to become your drone.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll need to go a bit further in,&quot; Hank told you and kept going, &quot;we've only just made it into the jungle from the warehouse. Any security cameras that Dr. Benjamin has could be aimed here and can probably see us. Not to mention that we're still close enough to the warehouse that he'd hear anything that might happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along then,&quot; you sighed to the colony, &quot;we must go a bit further.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then resumed following him. The colony moved with you, with the exception of a small number that had been left at the warehouse to spy on Doctor Benjamin. Once Hank was your drone and your colony established and growing, you'd send Hank back for them, and to take further action if necessary. The march continued for few hundred yards along the trail, which was fairly narrow. Hank had only just come to a stop when your compound eyes spotted movement the ferns near him. Like had disturbed something. You instinctively moved forward, pushing Hank aside with your body and moving at the source of the movement. As you got to the spot, a large brown and black snake lashed out and bit onto your right front leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dirty snake!&quot; you growled at it, &quot;try to kill my drone, will you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake had done you no harm. Against a normal sized ant, the snake had nothing to fear, but you were not a normal sized ant. You were a giant Divine Fire Ant queen, and the snake's fangs broke against your exoskeleton and didn't even get a chance to try to inject its venom.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Bushmaster!&quot; Hank spoke as he recognized the snake from behind you.<br />
<br />
You didn't care what kind of snake it was. It threatened Hank and thus threatened the future of your colony. As the snake realized he couldn't penetrate your armor, you brought your other front leg down on the snake's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Threaten my drone,&quot; you growled at the snake again, even if it could understand you.<br />
<br />
Not that the snake's ability to understand you was relevant. With it pinned down by one of your legs, you lowered your head and opened your mandibles. What followed were a series of sickening crunches as you closed your mandibles on the snake and killed it. Despite still feeling a little full from the boat ride, you began instinctively eating the snake. Crushing it and slicing it into smaller parts with your mandibles and moving it into your mouth. Fairly soon, the snake was gone, eaten, and your stomach felt rather full inside you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay, Hank?&quot; you asked to him as you turned around and waited for the colony to spell it out for him.<br />
<br />
They did so, but it took a little bit longer as the path wasn't wide enough for them to spell out the whole sentence at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could have dealt with the snake for you, my Queen!&quot; the drones told you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't let it threaten Hank,&quot; you replied to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine, thanks to you Christine,&quot; Hank spoke, addressing you by your name. He then also began wiping the snake's blood off of your mandibles.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is time, Hank,&quot; you spoke, &quot;please. Become my drone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank looked around and then nodded, &quot;I think we are far enough away now. Let me get ready first.&quot;<br />
<br />
You backed off for a moment as he set his duffel bag down and began setting his cloths on it. The clothes he had on weren't the same as what he wore in the lab. They seemed to be more for the hiking aspect of being in the rainforest, though not that he'd be wearing clothes again after he became your drone. As he stripped down, he revealed his naked human form to you and you found that there was plenty that your human self would have attracted to. He wasn't some body builder who's sole goal was to bulk up his body, but neither was he scrawny.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be an excellent drone, Hank,&quot; you said to him, and then commanded the colony, &quot;swarm him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your colony obeyed the command and you watched as they rushed forward onto Hank Pym, and soon, your antennae picked up a strong pheromone coming from the workers. The pheromones urged you to coil your abdomen under you and sting, which meant that Hank was now on his way. Hank cringed and gave a few pained groans and then staggered forward. But because so many of the colony was swarming him and delivering the mutagen in their venom, Hank was transforming faster.<br />
<br />
He tripped and fell at your feet, making many of the colony climb off of him, but you noticed that his arms and legs were beginning to transition into the multi-jointed legs of an ant. Fingers and toes merging together to form the basic claw like appendages that tipped the feet of any ant. Shortly after, his fifth and sixth legs grew out between what where his human arms and legs. His penis, while still erect was shriveling and shrinking as it prepared to become part of his abdomen. The part of his body that would become his thorax was also beginning to show signs of the segments that made up the bodies of ants. <br />
<br />
His skin was hardening into an exoskeleton, and you could soon see line running down the middle of his back where his armor had a natural &quot;break&quot; in it to allow him to breathe. When he breathed in, his exoskeleton expanded revealing the soft elastic layer that held the two sections of his exoskeleton together, and when he breathed out, his exoskeleton closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it hurts, Hank,&quot; you said to him, caressing his head with your antennae, &quot;but soon it'll be over and our colony will grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued to vocally cry out as you watched his abdomen push out behind him, connected to his thorax by a pedicel, divided into two segments. You continued to gently rub your antennae against his head, trying to comfort him and be there for him as he became your drone. A drone big enough to sire eggs within you. The small hairs on your antennae could feel his skin hardening. At this point, he stopped screaming. You guesses that his transformation had progressed enough that he could no longer speak vocally. He didn't have his antennae yet, so you doubted that he speak or understand you yet, but he was getting close to that. His human hairs were falling out as his eyes enlarged into big black compound eyes.<br />
<br />
You continued to watch Hank change and trying to comfort him as his mandibles began to push out from inside his mouth. They soon began to open and close as Hank tested the muscles that controlled them. You also watched as two small buds began to form on his back. The sight of it began to arouse you as you instinctively knew what would happen soon. Hank was beginning to grow wings, the hallmark of most Queens and Drones in the ant world. Seeing the largely clear wings with black veins in them begin to grow on Hank made you buzz your four wings a little bit. He was very nearly your drone. Finally, two elbowed antennae grew from his head and began to move about.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHH!&quot; came Hank's mental cry through the same sort of telepathic communication that you'd had to adapt to after you became the colony's queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, there,&quot; you said to him, now confident that he could understand you, &quot;it's over now... you are my drone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank managed to look rather surprised at this. It was as if he didn't expect it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christine...&quot; he said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have your own antennae now and can understand me,&quot; you said as you brought your head toward his and caressed his antennae with yours, &quot;we are ants. Divine Fire Ants. I am a queen ant and you are my drone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank slowly climbed up onto his now six legs and began to look things over. He was slowly processing the information that his body was now capable of processing. As he did so, you looked him over, and saw some stark differences between him and you and between both of you and the rest of the colony. Outside of the dimly lit lab, you had noticed some brownish-red shades in your exoskeleton, though  much of it was dark enough to look black, and most of the brownish-red segments were in your legs and the bands of your abdomen. The colony's workers were a brownish-red color that got progressively darker the closer you got to their abdomens. Hank, however, seemed to be a solid dark brownish-red color. So much so that even in the better visibility of where you were in the forest, his exoskeleton was nearly black.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are a magnificent drone, Hank,&quot; you said to him, &quot;and now it is time to move on to the next stage of enlarging our colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then moved to the bag that Hank had put down and gripped them in the claws on your own feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuptial flight,&quot; Hank commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you answered him, feeling overjoyed to be able to speak to Hank directly now, and feeling the colony beginning to climb onto you, as if they knew that you and Hank would soon take to the air to mate.<br />
