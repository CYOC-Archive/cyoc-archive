<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas reread the card to himself. The pink dice determines how much the players breasts will increase. The green decided who much the players butt increases. And the blue dice, for those who rolled doubles in the first two decides the players height. As well as a player who is able to get the same number on every dice will receive a golden dice to keep even after the game is finished.<br />
<br />
Thomas:<br />
<br />
Thomas watched at his sister, his mother, and himself grew larger asses and breasts. He wasn’t used to his chest being this big, well, he wasn’t used to having breasts in the first place. He noticed that now it wasn’t a change in turns anymore. They were all growing at the same time.<br />
<br />
Thomas looked down and saw his chest inflate again, expand with flesh to become bigger. He wasn’t huge and he knew it. Luckily for him, this change wasn’t huge. He was a D cup which was a fair amount to handle, only now bordering on an DD. His breasts were larger than average, but manageable. His butt also increased around the same amount as his bust. Only a small bit larger. He had a chest and a butt that would be envied by many but not something that would seem unnatural. He then realised that he had basically the same figure as his mother when she was around 21, which he remembered from old pictures.<br />
<br />
He looked down and saw into his new cleavage. He turned his head backwards, seeing his extended rear. He noticed that the clothes he was given in the second round were a little small on him, but concealed him fairly well.<br />
<br />
He looked at his butt. He was sort of mesmerised by it. He was a straight boy and he knew it, did that mean he was a lesbian? As he stared at his own butt and into his cleavage he noticed that he seemed a little higher up. He was standing up at this point.<br />
He looked down.<br />
His legs were longer, much longer, and still growing. They grew and grew. He must have grown a least a foot taller. After turning into a girl, he had shrunk the tiniest bit, but now he must have been 6 foot or more. <br />
He stopped at around 6 foot 2. Being easily the tallest in the house, even compared to his 5 foot 10 dad.<br />
<br />
Thomas had changed so much since the start of the game. He had become a girl, grown to a 14 year old. Grown larger breasts, a larger butt. Gained an entirely new face and a had black hair. He would be completely unrecognisable to anyone who knew him prior.<br />
<br />
Rachael:<br />
<br />
Rachael had just experienced her massive body grow even larger, this time in specific areas. She’d be at least slightly pleased with the increase in her bust and rear if she hadn’t grown so significantly in overall size.<br />
<br />
She knew what was to come. She was a smart woman, being a teacher and all. She had pieced together that her butt and breasts were going to increase exponentially by the end of the round. She felt a small pressure in her butt, “here we go,” she thought to herself.<br />
She looked at her husband, who she hadn’t really been paying much attention to. But he was a lot younger now, much more youthful now. She smiled a little bit by her thoughts. Then she remembered her body. She was a much older woman now, not to mention she was a blimp. She snapped out of her trance. Her butt had just finished growing. She was lifted up like she was sitting on a booster seat. She had more than half a cheek each spilling off the side of the chair she was in. Unluckily for her. The chairs had armrests. She was locked in tight. <br />
<br />
She looked down at her chest, she knew the feeling all too well now. Her breasts grew. Both at the same rate as each other. Growing further and further along belly. Her clothing choice that day, after work, was an oversized shirt she had to borrow from her husband for work. Alice had managed to spill coffee all over the one she wore beforehand.<br />
<br />
A button flew off her shirt. Surprisingly, no buttons had flown off prior. Her belly had spilled out the bottom of the shirt. Her breasts had grown to reach as far as her belly. They distance they travelled was great, but they were very large overall. She could barely see the table over them. If she was any younger and her breasts were any firmer, her vision of the table would be a distant memory. Her breasts reached as far as her belly went out, if she didn’t have a shirt on, her nipples would surpass the distance of her belly.<br />
<br />
Since the start of the game, Rachael had turned from a fit and natural woman, who wore little to no makeup and looked amazing for her age, to an old woman who looked as if she could be an overfilled water balloon. A butt the size of her belly that not only stuck out like a sore thumb, but stuck out farther than what would be deemed normal. Her breasts were two overfilled water balloons that retained little to no youth. Not unlike her body.<br />
<br />
Alice:<br />
<br />
Alice had her hands around her breasts. She had been tempted to poke and feel her new breasts, but now that they had grown to near D cups, shouldn’t help herself. She was lifting each one feeling how they jiggled and fell, also feeling what it was like to have boobs.<br />
As she was playing with her new orbs, she failed to notice that they were growing bigger. She only realised when they began spilling over the sides of her hands. She let go. They fell down, reaching further out but remaining perky. She picked up on her cushioned seat underneath her. She looked down and saw her widened hips. Not even having to turn her head far to see how wide they had become. Not absolutely unnaturally bigger, but incredibly noticeable.<br />
<br />
She took her eyes from her growing rear and reverted her gaze back to her breasts. Fro the short time she’d not been focussing on them. They’d grown at the very least 2 cup sizes. They continued to grow another cup size before inevitably stopping. They were bigger than any she’d seen on any other woman. Alice didn’t know cup sizes, other than that her mother was a C cup... or at least used to be. But she was roughly an I cup, very close to a J cup.<br />
She watched her butt finish growing, her hips were a fair few inches wider than her shoulders. Her butt stuck a lot.<br />
<br />
She looked at herself. She grabbed her breasts. She didn’t have a bra, of course. The game began when she was 7, she was now 14 years old with an I cup and butt to match. She sat, playing with her slightly increased bust. She didn’t care who was watching. She was busy poking the side of her chest when she noticed her legs were getting longer. Her torse extended as well. She realised this is what the blue dice would do. She looked at her sister— her brother. He had grown too. His torso was longer, as well as his expanded chest and butt. Nothing compared to her own, she giggled at that thought.<br />
She was close to finishing her height growth, she looked over to her mother, still in her seat. She could see her mother’s head, shoulders and upper back. Her breasts peering just in Alice’s view from the floor she was sitting on. Her mother’s entire body was larger. It took up more space. Her shoulders, before, wouldn’t have even reached the edge or the top of the chair. Now they were wider than the chair by a large amount. They were also taller than the chair, Alice looked a tiny bit lower and saw most of her mother’s oozing ass flowing from the sides of the chairs.<br />
<br />
Alice knew that you couldn’t be attracted to family members since kissing her brother on the lips. But this kind of attraction was way new. She liked boys, but she had the same tingly feeling for girls. Especially the big girls like her mom was now. Whilst thinking about all this, Alice realised she was idly playing with her breasts. She also realised that she’d stopped growing.<br />
<br />
Alice had changed, she had gone from the excited and extroverted 7 year old girl... to an excited and extroverted 14 year old girl with massive boobs and a huge butt, with bright blonde hair and an adorable face.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thomas walked up to Alice and held his hand out to help her up. He knew she was his sister and he wouldn’t even think of trying anything with her, but he knew that any boy like him would die for a girl like her.<br />
He lifted Alice up, she wobbled with her new weight. They all sat at the table in their seats.</p>
