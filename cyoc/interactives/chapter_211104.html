<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny asked Jeff to move and she meticulously began going through countless packages. After about 25 minutes Jeff became bored of staring over her shoulder deciding to sit on his bed. He frequently checked in with &quot;find anything of interest?&quot; only to be rebutted with &quot;Yes. but I haven&#39;t decided yet if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.&quot; every few minutes or so. Eventually Jeff asked if she would mind him playing video games, to which Jenny happily agreed, if only to keep him from interrupting her what seemed, every 5 seconds...<br />
<br />
Jeff loaded a game and progressed a little bit towards the next level feeling the adrenaline kick in he felt hot for a moment before the feeling passed. Filled with a sudden urge to check himself out he paused the game and went to the bathroom finding his reflection to be a heavily stubbled 30 something year old man, complete with cowboy hat, boots, buttondown shirt, vest, trenchcoat, and a gun in its holster. &quot;HWhut in the blue blazers is goin&#39; Jinny?&quot; Jeff belted out in a rich bass befitting his new stature.<br />
<br />
Giggles erupted from the other room as Jenny pranced down the hall. &quot;So, What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jinny, you know I dunna like cowboys, &#39;an ya went &#39;n messed with my speech pat&#39;erns too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do, and I really wanted to do it all, so I did. Go ahead, look at yourself and tell me you don&#39;t like any piece of it. Go on, look, what do you want to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked long and hard but every piece of it felt right, complete, even going back to the way he was felt wrong... He hated cowboys, fundamentally... but he suddenly was one, plucked straight from the wild west and he loved every bit of himself. &quot;Now Miss. Jinny, I know you is just havin&#39; yer fun &#39;n all...&quot; Jeff absentmindedly went into his coat pocket pulling out a short thin cigar and lit it up without realizing. &quot;But to tell you gods honest truth, I haf&#39;ta say I make a mighty fine cowboy and its strikin&#39; me funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny wanted mental changes but never dreamed they&#39;d be this complete. &quot;Why are you calling me MISS Jenny all of a sudden?&quot; she asked accusingly though enjoying every minute of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t rightfully know. I ain&#39;t too sure what&#39;s goin&#39; on but it felt like we&#39;d hafta be courtn&#39; to jus&#39; call you by yer first name. I dont wanna go disrespectin&#39; you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, we are courting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that... its jus&#39; I&#39;m twice your age now an it all feels kinda like God&#39;ll be mad at me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny rolled her eyes, still enjoying the situation immensely. &quot;Is that better?&quot; Jenny glanced at the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jeff did the same while taking a deep drag on his cigar. &quot;You dun went and made me a smoker?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I made you a younger cowboy. See.&quot; <br />
<br />
He still looked 23-25 due to sun damage, alcohol, and smoking but somehow he knew he was just 20. Still, Jeff felt like nothing about him should change, initially caught off guard by the cigar, it all still felt completely right, &quot;You ain&#39;t gone back tu&#39;thu machine. You best start splain&#39;in.&quot; Jeff took an absent minded drag on his cigar in confusion/frustration.<br />
<br />
Jenny giggled reveling in her newly begotten power. &quot;Calm down you big lug. I realized there were too many things I wanted to try. Poking through countless menus on that machine were just tedious, so I decided that It&#39;d just be so much easier if I could change you with my thoughts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gunna change into any man you want at a whim?&quot; Jeff was horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes, but... you&#39;re thinking small, I don&#39;t have to keep you a male, or a human for that matter, or even an animal... and it doesn&#39;t stop at your body, your memories, your emotions, your knowledge, just as if you were sitting next to that machine and I was controlling it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hated everything he was hearing, he had just been enslaved by his girlfriend but as she sauntered up to him step by step, seductively, slowly, he was painfully turned on, and scared. Finally he broke the tension and kissed her, pulling her to him.<br />
<br />
As much as he wanted to rip off his clothes and get naked Jeff felt terribly claustrophobic in the the tiny bathroom, continuing, to make out the couple slammed against the wall across from the bathroom door and Jeff found the hallway was no better, Jenny touched his rock hard cock through his pants making his eyes roll into the back of his head with intense pleasure. Despite all this he needed to get outside, and only desperately wanted to get off...<br />
<br />
Jeff ran down the stairs and out the door collapsing to the driveway when it all went black. When Jeff&#39;s senses came back to him it was like he was floating and could see all around him at once, but he couldn&#39;t move and he couldn&#39;t see above or below him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffbot, Navigate to the nearest mall.&quot; Came Jenny&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I don&#39;t... Route Found... understand... Navigating.&quot; Jeff&#39;s vision did things that would make humans vomit, but Jeff&#39;s stomach is now a gas tank and he doesn&#39;t have muscles. It wasn&#39;t until he pulled out of the subdivision that he had a semblance of what was happening, and even then, having no control over his body added to the disorientation...<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unexpectedly, Jenny responded. &quot;You&#39;re my car and you&#39;re taking me on a date to the mall silly. You should have woken up by the time I told you to navigate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand I&#39;m a vehicle, but why? Also, who&#39;s driving? neither of us have a license...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re driving, you&#39;ve been programmed with 100 lifetimes of driving experience, or something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to be a vehicle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Jeff, I need a vehicle...&quot; The sporty two seater interior remolded, shifting Jenny to the passenger side and a 45 year old version of Jeff pulled itself into existence in the driver seat... &quot;There, you&#39;re a car centaur like thing, are you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
A perspective from inside the vehicle was added to everything else Jeff was processing. &quot;Maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
They arrived at the mall safe and sound and Jeff pushed the button to turn off the car, accidentally sending his consciousness to black.</p>
