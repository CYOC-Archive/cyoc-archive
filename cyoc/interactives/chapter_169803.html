<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melody got a bit of a chuckle in watching through Miles&#39; interview with Leila, Roger Stevenson, and Dan Shore and how the two Iraq War veterans rescued Leila. The introduction and the shot of Leila in lingerie made for some laughter, but Miles did recover and behaved himself appropriately, which in a way was something that Melody expected. She&#39;d worked alongside Miles&#39; parents long enough to know that they wouldn&#39;t let him be a jerk or some other kind of creep and had learned on Miles&#39; interest in journalism as well. In this, she expected Miles to be as professional as possible, given what she&#39;d been told, and he ultimately did as was to be expected from him.<br />
<br />
To Melody, that was just another sign of how things had gone for group of them... including Joanne and Nicole, and the family feud between them from which the whole adventure started. And in the end it all worked out with the staff that had cared for both Joanne and Nicole coming out to Animalia as well as Joanne paying for those that wanted to convert to convert. And while not all of Joanne&#39;s staff accepted the idea, Melody was among those that did and had some interest in it, particularly in relation to the fact that the Geico Gecko was actually based on a real animal species, and the kind of Animalian that Melody had become...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The transformation didn&#39;t hurt, but it did set in pretty quickly after Melody had gotten the injections that would insure her transformation. But as felt her body grow warm, a part of her was looking eagerly to some of the perks that came along with it. After all, she&#39;d seen that a lot of the trouble between Joanne and Nicole had been fixed as a result of their becoming Animalians, and both seemed to be enjoying it. That gave Melody the hope that she could enjoy it too... and given the fact that geckos were pretty good at climbing, she&#39;d already had the joke that she&#39;d have an easier time doing windows as a Gecko Animalian.<br />
<br />
As the door that lead out into the hall shut, Melody looked down to her hand where she could see her changes beginning. Her finger nails were being absorbed into her skin as it transitioned into sea green scales that gradually became more of a light green color as they moved up from her hands and up her arms. She smiled and rubbed her hands together, and as she did so, she could feel all the ridges and pads forming under her fingers, they seemed to flex and bend as she moved her hands, indicating that the adaptations that geckos were known for that allowed them to climb were coming in quickly. Of course, she also figured she might need to test that out at some point, but she didn&#39;t know how. Geckos were generally fairly small lizards, and while that would mean she would be a particularly large Animalian, she also knew she&#39;d be bigger than the species her Animalian form would be based on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot; Melody said to herself with a small smile, though some of her excitement was soon lost as her pants and panties suddenly became tight around her.<br />
<br />
She looked back over her shoulder to see that just as with all female Animalians, she was gaining the generous curves that Animalian females were known for. Her butt was bigger and her hips were growing wider, and it wasn&#39;t flab. It was all firm and it was stretching the limits of her pants and likely her panties, as they were built for someone who didn&#39;t have a curvaceous body. The thing that Melody noticed the most, though was the lump that was forming at the back top of her pants. Her tail was already starting to grow and it was confined by her clothing, and that set her about moving to reorganize things and slip out of her pants. They might tightly fit around her hips and rear in her new form, but would still need major alterations to accommodate her growing tail. Though, Animalia had also had those that made a living by adapting clothing to suit those needs, and Melody was confident that more comfortable clothing could be procured.<br />
<br />
And as she got her pants down, a moderately long light green tail a dusting of faded brown scales bloomed out behind her. The bigger thing was that there was less pressure down there and she felt a bit more comfortable, even as the bones in her face began to crackle and snap a bit as they pushed forward into a short triangular muzzle. Her muzzle largely had light green scales, but there was an orange band that seemed to run parallel to her lips and was just above her nostrils at the tip of her new muzzle. She wanted to test out how to speak with her new muzzle when a new set of pressure came in and that made her look down to the front. And there she could see her breasts swelling and growing larger. They pushed out in front of her and had already popped one button on her shirt as they grew out toward the size that Animalian females were well known for. This, though, was a bit more painful as her enlarging breasts were growing into the D range and were stuffed and compressed in a small B cup bra.<br />
<br />
Melody was soon wrestling to get out of her shirt and then her bra. It was only once she got the bra off that she felt a bit more comfortable as her now ample chest bounced a bit once freed from their fabric prison. Melody also noted a slight flicking of milk from her nipples as they fell down to rest, as it were. She also quickly could feel the weight that her new breasts had. They were firm, and as Melody lifted up a hand to test their weight, she had to admit it felt good, but she couldn&#39;t deny their weight was more than she expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalian women must all have excellent back muscles,&quot; Melody said to herself, &quot;I better have them too...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And I do,&quot; Melody admitted to herself as she thought back on her own transformation, becoming the Gold Dust Day Gecko Animalian that she now was.<br />
<br />
Adjusting to her new size took a little getting used to, as she was never all that big to begin with, but she guessed that a great many Animalian women had to adapt to that. The only one who didn&#39;t was probably the Dinotopian, Jen, but then from all the reporting, Jen already had been very well endowed to begin with. Most other women that became Animalians were like Melody and had their breasts grow in size. But Joanne and Nicole had been helpful and understanding, and while Melody had no plans for nude sunbathing, there were some times where the three of them did relax in the sun room in swimsuits.<br />
<br />
Of course there were some other adjustments that also came along that had more to do with the type of Animalian Melody became and what all was represented by it... And that got her mind going back about a week.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Melody was going about some standard dusting that was a part of the daily routine that was there and was essentially standard work to keep the rather extensive mansion clean. Nicole was out, likely with her own work, Joanne was in her office elsewhere in the mansion and some of the other staff members were going about their normal work for the day and Miles was off to audition for Animalia Ambassadoria. So for the moment, Melody was alone and was going about her work, and having to be careful to make sure her generous Animalian bosom didn&#39;t accidentally knock anything over. She glanced out a window to see someone approaching the door, but she figured that would likely fall to either Joanne or the assigned head of her staff. Thus Melody went about her work and ignored the doorbell when it rang.<br />
<br />
Though it wasn&#39;t soon after that when the intercom went off and Melody was contacted directly by the head of the staff, Jasper. &quot;Melody... if you could come down to the main entryway, it would appear that our guest is interested in meeting you specifically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Joanne or Nicole?&quot; Melody wondered hitting the return button.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you,&quot; was Jasper&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is he?&quot; Melody wondered. Some friends and family knew that she had accepted Joanne&#39;s offer to move to Animalia to stay part of Joanne&#39;s staff, but if they were to come and visit, she actually expected that arrival to come closer to what was normally the end of her shift and she&#39;d have some free time.<br />
<br />
&quot;He says he works for Geico,&quot; Jasper responded, &quot;come quickly, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melody gave a puzzled blink at that, though she gave a startled jump when she heard Joanne&#39;s voice when she stepped away from the intercom panel.<br />
<br />
&quot;They might be wanting you to do some ads for them,&quot; Joanne spoke as he drifted into another doorway as Melody jumped and looked to her employer. Joanne smiled and then wiggled her ears to show how she&#39;d heard the conversation. &quot;It should be fun... and you&#39;d make more money from it. I can help if they have any fine print that they&#39;re dealing with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Melody answered.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And of course it was a guy looking for some sponsorship deals,&quot; Melody chuckled to herself as she checked over a couple of her schedule calender&#39;s as well, and there were some days where she had some filming sessions to be a real life Geico Gecko, &quot;though... I still wonder why they want me... the actual Geico Gecko is male... and I&#39;m quite obviously female. Though some of them do seem to be more of a set up for a date for the gecko...&quot;<br />
<br />
She eventually shrugged at that. A lot of the ads that Animalians had been asked to appear in often related to things that would attract Animalian interests. There weren&#39;t too many that got picked for ads that would appeal to more than just Animalians, and those that did were often in rather selective situations in order to make that case for what they were advertising clear. That usually came from companies that already had an animal, or animal-like mascot. Geico was one of those companies, and it appeared that Animalia didn&#39;t have a Gold Dust Day Gecko prior to her, and thus Geico would be interested...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully, Joanne was able to talk their lawyer into accepting no lewd ads and that none of the ads done would interfere with my personal life,&quot; Melody thought to herself, &quot;that&#39;s a good thing... as out here... it may not be too long before someone comes a calling to court me. And if I&#39;m lucky... we&#39;ll fall in love, get married, and lay eggs... or I&#39;d lay them.&quot;</p>
