<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric, Frieda and Spencer were all snuggled together after their intense moment of passion. All three hugging each other; each blissfully asleep. Each dreaming the same dream.<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson was twenty five years old and with his wife Spencer Anderson as she undergoes the rigors of childbirth. Next to Spencer is Frieda Knight; also in labor and about to give birth. With Eric providing moral support to both woman; each scream as their baby’s head crown and the child slides out of their birth canals. As a nurse swaddles the screaming newborns and then handing them to the happy mother’s; Tears of joy can be seen from all three. Eric the father of two children is the most thrilled.<br />
“So have we picked out names,” Eric asking both Spencer and Frieda clearly grinning from ear to ear.<br />
Martha Maggie Anderson,” Spencer looking at her child; giving her daughter her grandmother’s names. Eric agreed the names were fitting.<br />
“Bethany Anderson-Knight,” Frieda speaks as her newborn daughter starts to calm down at her mother’s voice. Since Eric married Spencer; he also loved Frieda. While polygamy was illegal in the state of Washington; Eric and Spencer had an exclusive open marriage with Frieda, who was technically still single. Hence Frieda’s daughter having both her and Eric’s last name, just hyphenated.<br />
<br />
Shortly after, Eric and Spencer’s parents burst in to congratulate the unconventional happy family. Following behind was Frieda’s uncle Lance and her mother Amanda both wanting to share in the joy. Absent from the celebration of the birth of two new girls was Benton Knight.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
Benton was asleep in the hospital after being subjected to a battery of tests for bipolar disorder; he chose to sit next to his wife instead of sleeping in the hospital bed provided in another room. The dream he had was anything but happy and joyful.<br />
<br />
A solemn person walks down a darkened corridor of the ward holding the feral weres. While the ferals usually lunge and snapped at anyone and as they walked by; the ferals here were oddly silent; they smelled a mother and her newborn child asleep in her bosom. The woman stops at a particular cell and stares at the feral were-panther locked away. She taps on the armored Plexiglas to get his attention.<br />
<br />
The feral beast reals around to see who that dared to challenged him. About to snarl and snaps he stops; he stares into the woman’s eyes as she also stares back at him. Shifting her arms she presents the precious object she was clutching.<br />
“Your granddaughter,” Frieda speaks; “Her name is Bethany.”<br />
Benton just stares through the glass separating the two; for a brief moment Benton recognizes his daughter. But that moment of clarity fades and he starts growling and snapping. This causes Frieda’s daughter to wake and cry as newborns are want to do. Frieda not flinching at her father’s savagery calmly turns around and walks out of the ward; the other feral weres, also joining in the howling and snarling.<br />
<br />
Benton still asleep finds himself in a forest; in his were-panther form. Sniffing the air he catches the scent of several weres all over the place. He was being hunted; Benton snarled in rage, the feeling of being cornered like a savage beast angered him. Deciding to flip the script as it were; Benton targeted the nearest were. Barreling towards him he lunges at him; teeth barred and claws loose, he is immediately struck by several tranquilizer darts and stun guns. Collapsing on the ground as the electricity shoots through him and the sedatives course through his veins; Benton looks up to see a strange person reach down to grab him.<br />
<br />
Benton now in a impeccable Armani suit is sitting in an empty café Luna with the strange person that just grabbed him from the forest.<br />
“Well now that you have had a sample of what might happen to you,” the strange person was sipping a latte; “perhaps now you will stop trying to pretend things are going to go your way.”<br />
“Who the fuck are you,” Benton clearly confused and angry at what just happened; “And why am I here?”<br />
“Who I am is not important Benton,” Says the strange person; “As for why you are here, sitting in this café, it’s so we can have a chat.”<br />
“You mind telling me what the hell I just saw?” Benton clearly agitated.<br />
“Possible futures for you; not necessarily in the order you saw them in. What’s important is that you listen to what I say. Not many get a chance to talk to me; your wife before she crashed her car was the last to speak to me.”<br />
“But she passed out from being infected with hook worm,” Benton looking suspiciously; “How could she have a chat with you?”<br />
“The same way we are,” Smiles the strange person; “Through dreams.”<br />
<br />
The strange person gets up and waves his hand; the café they are at fades out and changes to that of a hospital delivery room filled with happy people.<br />
“What you see here, is what Eric, Spencer and your daughter are dreaming in unison. The birth of their children and their loved ones gathered around.”<br />
Benton makes a bee line to his daughter. While it’s clear she is older looking, he sees Frieda smiling as her Uncle Lance and Mother Amanda look at the newborn girl in Frieda’s arm.<br />
“What’s her name,” Benton turning around to see the strange person no longer there.<br />
<br />
“Well there you are Benton,” Amanda speaking; “Meet your granddaughter Bethany.”<br />
“My granddaughter,” Benton looking stunned as Frieda offers him the chance to hold the tiny child in his arms.<br />
“Bethany Anderson Knight,” Frieda speaking to her father. <br />
“My granddaughter,” Benton cries with joy.<br />
<br />
The room once again fades out but this time it reforms to his private study; the strange man once again is present but sitting in Benton’s chair.<br />
“What you saw was also a possible future, “the stranger speaks; “just accept what doctor Tora will tell you in the morning. Yes you won’t like it; but what is life without disappointment.”<br />
“It’s a life not worth living,” Benton finishing the latter half of the quote his father often said.<br />
“Good,” the stranger smiling; “perhaps you finally have some sense knocked into you.”<br />
“What will happen if I reject what Doctor Tora says,” Benton looking at the strange person.<br />
“Then the elder council will lock you away in the same cages situated several floors below where you are currently sleeping,” the stranger speaks showing no hint of humor of sympathy; “consider this your true chance at redemption Benton. That show you put on for the press with promising to build a new elementary school will come for naught if you reject what I offer you.”<br />
<br />
Back in the hospital, Doctor Tora looks on both Amanda and Benton Knight as they both sleep. While Amanda sleeps peacefully, Doctor Tora see Benton twitch and spasm as he is clearly having a vivid dream. Choosing not to disturb the man; He leaves the room letting the two sleep.<br />
“No sense in disturbing both with what I have to say,” the doctor sighs; “it can wait in the morning.”</p>
