<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somehow Matt had forgotten that he could make them want to have sex with each other. The thought completely slipped his mind until he saw it on the Chronivac. He turned his attention to the two guys as Austin was about to throw down. His body tightened as he was ready to throw the first punch. Matt thought about the two of then having sex. He sent the thought to Austin.<br />
<br />
Austin&#39;s body relaxed for a second as he looked down at the little man. He was getting hard. &quot;What the..?&quot; one hand had already made it to his crotch while the other was sneaking into the back of his pants. He fought that one as it tickled his asshole. As his finger touched it a powerful sensation shot through his body. &quot;Fuck,&quot; he cursed pulling it away as hard as he could. His other hand was getting busy as it rubbed the front of his pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;Austin?&quot; Ryan questioned. The bigger man&#39;s gaze seemed to be at nothing all at once. Then an idea popped into Ryan&#39;s head. &#39;I should fuck him.&#39; Ryan&#39;s face blushed at the thought. He couldn&#39;t do that. Austin would kick his face in if the little guy even touched him. Shaking his head at the thought he still found himself taking a step forward. &quot;Austin?&quot; he said again. His hand was reaching out to touch the jock&#39;s chest, as he slowly gave into the thought.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Austin was still trying to fight it. He was an alpha. That&#39;s what he told everyone. If he let this little fucker fuck him how could anyone take him seriously. Everyone at the school would know he took it in the ass. But his finger was making it&#39;s way back to his hole. Softly pushing against the tight skin. Working it&#39;s way in. He moaned as part of it pushed inside of him. His knees getting weak as he did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Austin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin came out of his trance seeing the little guy right up next to him. In one swoop he reached down and picked up Ryan. He was light and easy to lift. Then set him down on the counter. Their eyes locked. For a second Ryan thought it was going to be bad as Austin easily moved his body but realized there was a different look in his eyes. A lustful gaze as he moved closer for a kiss. Their lips locked as Austin&#39;s hands wrapped around Ryan&#39;s smaller body. Ryan still  cautiously, did the same. <br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s rhythm increased as he felt the passion behind Austin&#39;s kiss. He&#39;d overheard the rumor&#39;s from the girls but experiencing it was a completely different story. Somehow he was able to make it better than Ryan could imagine. Austin put more of his weight onto Ryan&#39;s body. Then paused. He looked down, stars in his eyes, &quot;I want you to fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha--??&quot; Ryan&#39;s mouth hung open inviting another kiss. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;d said it again. With even more dedication. &quot;Re-re-really?&quot; Ryan stared up awestruck. The fantasy becoming even more of a reality. He blushed slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So cute,&quot; Austin muttered. He set Ryan back down on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are... Are you sure?&quot; Ryan said but Austin had already dropped his shorts and underwear. The guy was packing. His 7 inches shot forward and slightly to the right. Ryan&#39;s eyes went wide as he started playing with himself in front of him. One of Austin&#39;s fingers had made it&#39;s way back to his backside again trying to tease Ryan into getting closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get it warmed up for you,&quot; Austin teased.<br />
<br />
Ryan moved his way back there while Austin braced himself against the counter. He felt Ryan&#39;s cock push up against him. The small timid boy was still unsure of himself. Austin helped him along, pushing against the hard cock. &quot;Ooooo,&quot; he moaned louder than he normally would. &quot;Feels so good,&quot; he taunted moving his body back and forth. Ryan quickly grabbed on and started pushing deeper in.<br />
<br />
&#39;Austin was serious!!&#39; he thought as he sped up. His body enjoyed every minute of it. He gripped the tight muscular body beneath him. Pumping harder and harder. Austin&#39;s moans became louder filling the cafeteria. He wasn&#39;t trying to be quiet. It fueled Ryan&#39;s desire. He came after another loud grunt. Pump after pump of seed filled the jock&#39;s ass. <br />
<br />
Austin didn&#39;t last much longer. Feeling the smaller guy come in him he came on the wall in front of him. He slowly was starting to come to. The two looked up and realized the entire cafeteria had just saw what they&#39;d done. In their horny rage, Austin had just been fucked by Ryan. At least 20 different people had seen it. There was no denying it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-uh-I-uh&quot; Austin was trying to figure out what to say. Ryan&#39;s face had gone so red that it looked like he was about to faint. The two had obviously been in their own little world and were coming back to everyone else&#39;s. Their cocks quickly deflated.<br />
<br />
The woman behind the register stared at them with disgust. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this. I&#39;ve already called security. You two will be expelled and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the least of your worries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt quickly realized his mistake. He went to the chronivac, &#39;No one cares when I make two people have sex.&#39; The prompt popped up. &#39;Would you like people affected to know about this change?&#39; &#39;NO!&#39; Matt hit the button harder trying to emphasize his frustration. He looked up and saw that everyone was minding their own business. Even Austin and Ryan went back to checking out. Sure Austin&#39;s shorts were still around his legs and Ryan hadn&#39;t buttoned his pants yet but they were acting like everything was normal. They paid for their respective meals. But what surprised Matt was that the two were actually sitting together.</p>
