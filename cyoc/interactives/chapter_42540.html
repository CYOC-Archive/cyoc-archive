<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy poked his head into the bathroom and said &quot;C'mon man, we gotta go!&quot; Jake reluctantly gathered his things and walked out to Jeremy's truck and climed in. On the ride to school, Jeremy casually stroked Jake's leg, causing him to moan and feel aroused. Jeremy continued, making a few soft moans himself, and soon Jake felt something wet dribble down his chin. Jake lifted his hand to wipe it away and looked at it. It was a sweet sticky substance that seemed familiar but he couldn't quite think of what it could be.<br /> <br /> A moment later Jake's eyes shot wide with the realization that it was pre-cum, that he was literally drooling pre-cum out of his mouth as Jeremy stroked his thigh. Soon they arrived at school and Jeremy climbed out of the car. &quot;Come on, cock-boy, we've got classes to get to.&quot; Jake sat there for a moment before picking up his things and walking into the school behind Jeremy. The two jocks split apart to go to their separate classes, and as they did, Jake felt an uncomfortable sensation in the pit of his stomach.<br /> <br /> Jake went to his class and did his best to pay attention, but the sensation kept getting stronger and he bgan to feel drowsy. Jake began to drift off when the teacher, a cold shrew of a woman, slammed a book down on his desk. Though it startled him, Jake found his body was still sluggish, his reactions slowed. &quot;Mister Smith! If you would please refrain from sleeping in my class!&quot; Jake pulled himself upright in his chair but found it difficult to keep his back straight and he kept slouching. The teacher rolled her eyes and returned to the less, but Jake was worried that he was having troubke keeping himself upright.<br /> <br /> Finally Jake's class was over and he headed for the cafeteria. Jake still felt drowsy but on the way Jeremy started walking with him and the uncomfotable feeling went away. Jeremy put his arm around Jake's shoulder as they were walking ad whispered in his ear &quot;you doing ok there, man? want to make sure my cock is doing fine.&quot; Jake blushed furiously, and Jeremy rubbed his shoulder slightly. The mere touch of Jeremy's hand on his shoulder caused Jake to softly moan. He felt himself becoming more awake, his reflexes becoming quicker, and the sluggishness fading.<br /> <br /> Before they made it to the line for food, Jeremy steered them down a different hallway and into the bathroom. Jeremy pushed Jake into a stall, stepped in with him and closed the door behind them. Jeremy leaned in and started to kiss Jake, who was confused but gave into the immense pleasure running through his body as Jeremy kissed and stroked his body. <br /> <br /> Jake felt an unusual bloating sensation in his body, but it felt good. He was drooling more, though Jeremy seemed to be drinking it down as it came out. A pins and needles sensation filled Jake's legs as he felt compelled to sit down. A dizzy-ing sensation overtook Jake as he felt himself lay down, Jeremy was rubbing his body all over, Jake's eyes shut in pleasure. Jeremy pulled my shirt and jeans off leaving Jake nearly nude. Jake's thighs had swollen some while his lower legs and feet seemed to have shrunk slightly in size. Jake was in new heights of pleasure as Jeremy continued to stroke his body. Jeremy lifted Jake up and turned him over, pointing his head towards the toilet as he contined to lick, kiss, and stroke Jake's body. The feelings were building in both of them, Jake moaning loudly, as they rapidly approached orgasm. Jake's eyes snapped open as he felt Jeremy's bare crotch push against his ass, and then they started to cum. The thick creamy jizz rocketing out of Jake's mouth and into the toilet. Jake hardly had time to recover before he felt his body tingle and his head swim with disorientation. He watched as the toilet bowl full of cum began to grow in size. The disorientation continued as he felt himself begin to lift off the ground and he realized that he was the one shrinking. He finally stopped shrinking when his whole body was about one foot tall, but that's when he looked up and realized that he was now attached to Jeremy's crotch. Kyle, who had been his jockstrap the whole time began to grow over him as Jake saw his world become dim and red as the jockstrap covered him. Kyle trapped him against Jeremy's body, his legs pulled back between Jeremy's legs, and his body pressed against Jeremy's crotch. Jake heard some rustling and felt movement as his world became dimmer.<br /> <br /> Then with the sound of a zipper, Jake's world went completely dark.</p>
