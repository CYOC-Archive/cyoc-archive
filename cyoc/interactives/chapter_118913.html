<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was - as per usual - trying to slide gracefully into her her sock as that dinosaur of a phone rang. The damn thing was from the eighties and Mrs. Smith was oh so kind to give it to dear Jennifer, however it was debatable whether it was actually worth the racket it rang. Unfortunately, in this instance it was ten fold more obnoxious than the typical teenage brat typing like a condescending bastard on a perverted internet forum. <br />
<br />
Ms. Smith rudimentarily &quot;slipped&quot; on her sock and picked up the phone in such a way that would cool a moose in mating season. She was late to her fifth period so she could not tolerate an imbecile, however her thought process would seem to be more: &quot;OMG I can&#39;t believe mom didn&#39;t get me a smartphone!&quot; even though she knows full well that apple products are fucking apple products. In any case, she started with: &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms. Smith. I have a favor to ask of you.&quot; The voice was cold and callous, translated through a South Londoner accent - though for some ungodly reason hypnotic due to the fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello? Who is this?&quot; Jennifer asked as politely as she could manage. She wrestled the phone inbetween her shoulder and cheek and grabbed for her shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just call me Mr. Perkins. Have...&quot; Mr. Perkins coughed harshly into his phone so that even any physician would shiver &quot;... you forgotten me my dear?&quot; Mr. P. finished<br />
<br />
&quot;U-uh...&quot; Jennifer was partially petrified by Mr. P.. Who was he? And that name &#39;Perkins&#39;... Why was that so familiar? Ms. Smith finished with her makeup and adjusted her bust to fit comfortably in her top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer. Transform or Dare?&quot; Mr. P. said with a now croaking voice.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s eyes widened at the mention of that accursed game. That damnable game where she had so many adventures; how could she possibly forget...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Kyle!&quot; Jennifer said in a mix of joy and relief. &quot;Kyle! Where are you? Wh-what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle Perkins... Her companion on all of her adventures. He was the reason why she even existed in this world again - though even at the worst cost. There was no Kyle, but now Kalie and though she was great friends with Kalie, she wasn&#39;t Kyle. She wasn&#39;t there to save Jennifer when she was threatened to become a dragon or when Jennifer removed that cursed dog collar from Kyle&#39;s neck. Kyle, though being nobody, was the one who she had a true connection with.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m.. So sorry... I need you to...&quot; His rasping voice split the long silence of realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle.. What happened to you? How can I help?&quot; Jennifer&#39;s voice broke from joyous to concerned immediately<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten... Seconds...&quot; Kyle said<br />
<br />
&quot;Both!&quot; Jennifer finally answered, eager to see him again. She had completely ignored the fact that she was most likely marked absent as time never fails to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-for your transformation: You... Will die in your world and re-materialize in my current world, albeit in a different body, but similar body. I could not remember you exactly, Jennifer - so I&#39;m sorry for possible sudden changes. For another...&quot; Kyle&#39;s voice was stronger now, as if he was putting forth all of his effort into giving these commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... D-di..&quot; Jennifer felt her body weaken as every last ounce of strength was sapped from her body and she laid back onto her body. Her skin slowly turned pale and her vision weakened tremendously all while the popping sound in her ears obliterated her hearing. Her breathing started to become fainter and she could no longer feel the soft beneath her. She defecated through her panties as she no longer could hold her bowels. her heart beat rested below what was sustainable for the entire body and her belly started to inflate with gas as the contents of her extremities started to decompose and death traveled towards her now bloated and somewhat rotting body. Her belly finally popped partially and out from the decaying holes came mushrooms. Her bosom molded away and &#39;slowly&#39; her entire body just.. died, leaving only her mind mere seconds before oxygen depravation killed it. She could not think in her last seconds of accelerated death, and what once was a beautiful, youthful teenage girl was now a rotten corpse.<br />
<br />
Then, she awoke laying on her side on a hardwood, patterned floor. She felt... Strange. To start, there were locks of crimson red hair draped over her vision - but she was a blonde. When she got up, she noticed her chest and wide hips that emphasized a curve in her lower middle back. She wiped away the hair from her eyes and looked around. She was in a dark victorian style manor, somewhat covered in death and candle light. She looked down and examined herself, noticing her large bosom first and cupping the two in her hands. They weren&#39;t exactly disproportionate, but definitely not the greatest thing for a woman to deal with. She then noticed how her forearms were very well defined and took a better look at her shoulders and arms, which were also heavily defined. She felt around her waist and of course a lower than such to make sure nothing was... Weird, which there wasn&#39;t exactly anything strange down there, but her body was most definitely a fantasy - not to mention that she felt particularly tight in her privates, but at the same time awfully robust around the hips and especially the bottom. She didn&#39;t exactly know how different this new body would be up till that point, but then again Kyle probably still had the mind of a freshman.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wrapped her thigh length hair into a more manageable ponytail and called out for Kyle. She then heard cough and immediately - though at first also awkwardly - ran towards the sound of his coughing down the hall and into another living room. She found an old, wheelchair bound man sitting by a lit fireplace. The room was aged terribly as there were holes in the ground, and wallpaper peelings everywhere. The furniture was fine though, suppose that&#39;s convenient.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir!&quot; Jennifer said running towards the man in the wheelchair. &quot;Sir. Have you seen Kyle L. Perkins?&quot; she noticed her voice was lighter, though she brushed off the fact for now as she stopped just short of the man&#39;s reach.<br />
<br />
The man laughed slightly, only being broken by coughs later. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Jennifer. How&#39;s the new set of legs treating you?&quot; he answered rather happily, turning around to expose his aging, kind of fat self. His grey hair, or what was left of it circled around the back of his head and his face had the complexion of a corpse. He was smoking his pipe that they stole from a 13th century knight, which was made of chiseled ivory and ebony. He was dressed like a penguin, really, almost as if he was going to a ball of sorts<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle...? Oh my god what happened?&quot; Ms. Smith covered her mouth with both of her hands and started to tear up a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got dressed?&quot; Mr. Perkins answered calmly, puffing smoke off to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I mean... What happened to..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got older, my dear. I&#39;ve even acquired a fancy accent. You look nice by the way, just how I remembered you - well maybe with some minor alterations.&quot; He answered again, waving some excess smoke away. &quot;By the way, for your dare you&#39;re going to speak in a south london accent and call me &#39;grandad&#39;. You&#39;ll also go by &#39;Caryll&#39; now.&quot; he said with a smug smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I do that, grandad?&quot; Caryll asked, cringing when she said it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there was only one way to bring you into this world proper without complicating things. If I were to have you concieved out of an already displaced family, it&#39;d be impossible to foresee the outcome. I&#39;ve already caused much damage to our future; I&#39;m the reason why the British Empire still reigns over India, Australia and Egypt in your timeline.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was you?&quot; Caryll rose a brow and crossed her arms over her sensitive nipples, barely containing herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Dear Caryll, there should be a set of clothes upstairs for you - and as pleasing as it is to see you again, I&#39;d rather not give the wrong impression when we return home. We&#39;ll talk about my troubles there&quot; Mr. Perkins said with a smile, conscious that his long lost companion is now his great grand-daughter. He wondered: &quot;Does that mean I fucked my great grand daughter when we were both young? Or is she a completely different person now?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandad, please tell me this isn&#39;t the 16th century.&quot; Caryll said worriedly<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the 15th. Unfortunately for you, you have a rather large bust.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t this big when you knew me though!&quot; Caryll flared up a bit<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Now go get dressed.&quot; Kyle said maliciously</p>
