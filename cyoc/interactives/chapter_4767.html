<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan's Wish, Satyr Version, Part 5<br />
by John Satyr<br />
<br />
The two lovers kissed passionately for a few minutes. After that, Dan was ready to have a little meeting with the swim team.<br />
<br />
“But Dan, what am I gonna do?” asked Nick. “People are going to notice.”<br />
<br />
“Notice what?”<br />
<br />
“Well, don’t you think I look just a liiittle different from the rest of the guys now?” Nick pointed to his horns, and then looked down at his furry legs. Both boys smiled for a second. Nick was still hard as a rock.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. If anyone sees you, his mind will automatically be altered to believe you’ve always been a faun… a really hot faun.” Dan grinned.<br />
<br />
“Well, you did do a pretty good job on me, I must say.” Nick then flexed for Dan. <br />
<br />
“You’re such a show-off,” Dan chuckled. “C’mon let’s go.”<br />
<br />
As the two walked out of the locker room, Dan noticed the clothes that the coach had been wearing, laying on the floor. “I feel kind of bad for Mr. Smith,” Dan said to himself quietly. “Maybe I’ll give him a little break.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the little blob of light that had been zooming around halls turned back into Coach Smith. The man fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Ahh, what a headache!” he moaned. After a few seconds of getting his brain back together (sort of), he checked where his shorts were supposed to be, and realized why the floor was so cold. <br />
<br />
“I’m naked! I’M NAKED!” Before he could shout again, this terribly high-pitched groaning and panting coming from down the hallway distracted him. He looked in the direction that the noise was coming from. “What the?!”<br />
<br />
Coach Smith’s eyes widened as he watched two cute twinks, with fluttering pink wings, on top of each other. <br />
<br />
“Oh Kay! You are ssso fabulous at making love!”<br />
<br />
“Lan, you are doing such a sssuper job!”<br />
<br />
Before this day, Coach wasn’t all that crazy about two guys being together. But the sight of Kay and Lan having sex didn’t really bother him at all. In fact, he felt more of the opposite.<br />
<br />
“Aww, how sweet,” Mr. Smith said to himself. “Two young fellas in love. I think I’ll give them some time alone. I need to find my clothes anyway!”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Dan and Nick were heading for the pool. When they finally reached it, they were surprised (and upset) to find that no one was there.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit,” Dan sighed. “We had sex all thoughout swim practice, didn't we?” <br />
<br />
Nick frowned slightly, but a few seconds later, he started grinning.<br />
<br />
“Oh Danny boy, don’t you know what’s going on as we speak?”<br />
<br />
Dan shook his head, confused.<br />
<br />
“Football practice. And I think the track team is practicing as well.”<br />
<br />
Dan smiled wide. “Well then, let’s go outside for a bit, shall we?”<br />
<br />
Nick saluted. “Yes, Mr. Dan! SIR!” Dan laughed, and then spanked Nick’s perfect butt. <br />
<br />
When they got outside, they saw the whole track team running laps. The team was starting to look pretty tired, but the guys still tried to run as fast as they could. <br />
<br />
“You know Dan, centaurs are great runners.”<br />
<br />
“They sure are,” replied Dan. He snapped his fingers. After a few seconds, the boys noticed that the runners’ uniforms were starting to look really tight. Soon, they ripped to shreds. But the guys on the track team kept on running, as if they didn’t notice their changes. Dan and Nick stared in awe, enjoying the sight of the runner’s dicks flopping around as they jogged. <br />
<br />
“Wow, the track team is starting to get really hairy,” Nick said. “They look like they haven’t shaved in weeks. Hey, Jeff Johnson has a tail! They’ve ALL got tails! Don’t they realize what’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I didn’t want to interrupt their practice. I’m not that rude! Once they are fully transformed, having the body of a ‘taur will be normal for them anyway. No biggie.” <br />
<br />
The changes were starting to happen very quickly. Feet became hooves. Fur started sprouting. Balls started swelling, and dicks grew drastically. <br />
<br />
What had been the high school track team just moments ago, was now a herd of handsome young stallion centaurs.  <br />
<br />
“They’re beautiful,” Nick said softly. “And they’re still running!” he chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” Dan replied. “In a little bit, they’ll get bored with galloping, and move on to doing… better things with each other.” Dan winked, and Nick giggled. <br />
<br />
During this whole time, the football team had been working hard out in the field, preparing for the big game that’d be in a few days. They didn’t even notice what had happened to the members of the track team. <br />
<br />
“Ok guys, good work! Hit the showers!” It was Coach Smith. <br />
<br />
“Hey look! Coach found his clothes,” Dan whispered to Nick. Both guys started laughing. <br />
<br />
“Well, I don’t know about you,” said Nick, “but I wouldn’t mind seeing those guys on the football team with their clothes off.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. We will.” <br />
<br />
“Last one to the men’s locker room is a rotten egg!”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
The football team didn’t even seem to notice Dan and Nick standing in the locker room corner watching them undress… or at least they didn’t care. Dan was getting very good at altering people’s minds. <br />
<br />
“Wow,” whispered Nick. “The whole football team is uncut. That’s pretty rare, isn’t it?” <br />
<br />
“Nick, not all of them were uncut a few minutes ago. It’s the first part of their change. Centaurs don’t get circumcised!” <br />
<br />
“Centaurs… again?”<br />
<br />
Dan rolled his eyes at his goat-legged friend. “Nick, there are all kinds of centaurs. Stallions are great, but the type of ‘taur that this studly team is about to become is my favorite.”<br />
<br />
“And what would that be?” <br />
<br />
Dan smirked. “Nick, have you ever seen a plow horse before?”<br />
<br />
“Ooh!” replied the faun, rubbing his hands together. “Indeed, I have. They’re huge… every single part of them!” <br />
<br />
Dan snapped his fingers once more.<br />
<br />
Matt, the captain of the football team, caught a quick glimpse of his friend Paul’s dick. At first, it was by accident. But then Matt decided he had to take another look, and stared at his friend’s member in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Dude, Paul! You’re hung like a horse!”<br />
<br />
