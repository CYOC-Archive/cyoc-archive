<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After bringing the other Mika, Claudia, and Katie to see Kelly, Mika now began searching the camp ground. While she had told Claudia and Kelly her secret their was one more person she needed to tell, her twin. <br />
<br />
Mika sighed in frustration as she thought of her twin sister Kumiko. While the twins were close Mika was always concerned about Kumikos wilder tendencies. While not a bad kid, Mika worried how she would react to finding out her twin sister had become a Kitsune. Even worse, that she had neglected to tell her right away. Noticing her twin now exit one of the cabins, with a now much younger and more pregnant doppelgänger, Mika now worked up the courage to tell her sister her secret. As she approached she now Kumi she could see her sister give her a warm smile. “Hey sis,” Kumi said warmly. “Was wondering where you were hiding.”<br />
<br />
“Just taking care of a few things,” Mika smiled. “You want to take a walk?”<br />
<br />
Kumi nodded as the two now began to head towards the lake. As they journeyed they could already see some of the doppelgängers from the other timeline talking with their friends. “How do you think they’ll do,” Kumi asked.<br />
<br />
“Probably great,” Mika answered. “I mean, not for nothing most of them have been around magic longer than we have.” Kumi gave her sister a slight nod as the twins continued to walk. As Mika gazed at her sister she could see that something was troubling her. “Everything ok Kumi?”<br />
<br />
Kumi bit her lip as she anxiously looked backwards. She had been dying to tell her sister about Cole but hadn’t had the time. It seemed that Mika was often preoccupied with Claudia now a days and the twins rarely had a moment alone. “Okay don’t be mad,” she said. “But I want to tell you something. I’m actually really mad at myself for only telling you now but we never keep secrets from eachother.”<br />
<br />
“What is it,” Mika asked, despite a pang of guilt building in her stomach. Whatever was going on with Kumi appeared to be recent and it was tearing her wilder twin sister apart. Mika couldn’t help feel a bit guilty knowing that she had kept the secret of her Kitsune nature a secret from her twin for well over a month.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Kumi sighed. “When Lisa was training me, I kinda made ourselves older so we could go to the club.”<br />
<br />
“That’s it,” Mika chuckled. “Cmon Kumi, I would of expected that. Still can’t believe Kellie paired you two together I mean that was bound to happen.”<br />
<br />
“Oh ha ha,” Kumi smirked. “Yeah well that wasn’t the problem. The problem was, I kind met a guy there.”<br />
<br />
“Who,” Mika asked, slightly alarmed.<br />
<br />
Kumi shuffled nervously before taking a deep breath. “Cole Harris,” she breathed. “We’ve..um...actually been on a couple of dates.”<br />
<br />
Mika gawked at her sister, shocked by this revelation. “Cole Harris,” she hissed. “As in Claudia’s older brother Cole? Kumi! What the hell?! He’s like 5 years older than you AND I’m dating his sister!”<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t know I’m 16,” Kumi whined. “I made myself 21 when we go out. I didn’t even tell him my last name so he has no idea. I just wanted a shot Mika. I’m tired of everyone always thinking I’m a screw up and can’t be trusted.”<br />
<br />
Mika groaned, rubbing her eyes as she took a deep breath. She had a feeling Kumi was trying to change her ways. Ever since meeting her doppelgänger Mika had seen her sister go to great lengths to try and improve her reputation. Change, however, was slow and Mika could clearly see her sisters frustration. Mika had tried to tell her that her interactions with the Kitsune was integral  (especially seeing as she was the only mortal that had direct access to them) yet Kumi wasn’t very confident about her job. She didn’t think she was smart enough, capable enough. That was the furthest thing from the truth though, Kumi was a natural when it came to talking with people, no matter what kind of magical creature they were.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Mika sighed. “Kumi Listen, I’m shocked yeah but I’m fine with it.”<br />
<br />
“You are,” Kumi exclaimed, her eyes going wide.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I am sis,” Mika said. “I know you’ve been trying to change for the better. That’s why I feel like such an asshole right now.”<br />
<br />
“Why would you feel like an asshole,” Kumi said curiously, raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Mika sighed heavily, she wasn’t so much worried about Kumi not accepting who she was now but rather that she had not been told sooner. “Okay Kumi I’m gonna show you something,” she said. “It’s a bit of a shock.”<br />
<br />
“Hey Mika Listen,” Kumi said softly. “Look whatever it is I’m cool okay?”<br />
<br />
Mika could only nod as she began to transform herself. Green flame now engulfed the girl as she shrank down, standing on all fours. The teens face pushed out, her ears moving to the top of her head as jade green fur covered her body. Finally a single fox tail now extended from behind as a small green flame flickered at the tip. “I’m a Kitsune now Kumi.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” Kumi whispered. “How? Did, did they kidnap  you or something? When did this happen?”<br />
<br />
“Just let me explain okay,” Mika said as she watched her sister stare at her in awe. “Okay remember when I went to negotiate a peace deal with the Kitsune on Circes behalf and Lilith beat me to it.” Kumi nodded as she remembered the tense day over a month ago at Circes amusement park. “Here’s the thing, I...I couldn’t let an entire group of anthros be sacrificed to become Kitsune. So...I offered myself to Tatsu and Shizen.”<br />
<br />
“You offered yourself,” Kumi gasped. “Oh my god Mika! That’s crazy. And Tatsu and Shizen accepted?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Mika sighed. “You know them Kumi. They would rather not go to war, they want peace. When they saw though that I was willing to sacrifice myself for others they accepted and freed the other timeline of their obligation. Ever since, I’ve been a Kitsune.”<br />
<br />
Kumi narrowed her eyes as she now angrily stared at her sister. “That was almost two months ago now,” she hissed. “What the fuck you couldn’t of told me?! I mean Jesus I’ve been beating myself up about Cole aNd that was les than two weeks ago!”<br />
<br />
“I know I’m sorry,” Mika groaned. “I should of told you sooner. It just I was worried how you would take it, so I asked Claudia what she thought...”<br />
<br />
“YOU TOLD YOUR GIRLFRIEND BEFORE ME,” Kumi exclaimed. “What the fuck!!! We shared a womb Mika!”<br />
<br />
“I’m telling you now,” Mika whined. “And I want to tell you that Tatsu and Shizen are making a visit. They’re actually meeting with our doppelgängers and Kellie right now. Kinda had to tell Kellie about what I am.”<br />
<br />
“Oh so I’m practically the last person,” Kumi snorted. “You know you can be a real bitch sometimes, just for the record I don’t give a shit if you’re  Kitsune, a mutant, or fucking serial killer. Your my twin sister.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Mika apologized, her paw sheepishly scratching the back of her neck.<br />
<br />
“Lucky for you I’m trying to grow as a person,” Kumi grumbled. “Otherwise I’d grab you by that tail and swing a bitch.”<br />
<br />
Mika chuckled as her twin gave her a wry smile. “Sorry I kept this secret for so long sis.”<br />
<br />
As the sisters hugged, with Mika apologizing sincerely, they could hear sounds a loud roar emanate from back towards the cabins. “Sounds like some one  from the other timeline just found out about Tatsu and Shizen,” Kumi grumbled. Mika nodded as the two twins now headed back to camp, a small smile on her face as she realized that no matter what her sister had her back.</p>
