<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cam was a 14 year old boy with white skin, dirty blond hair, blue eyes, and he was wearing a black shirt with blue shorts and sneakers. He was average size for a 14 year old not too big not too skinny. He was being dropped off at his friend Jake’s  14th birthday party by his mom. Once they arrived Cam grabbed his gift for Jake, kisses his mom on the cheek and then ran ooff towards the party. <br />
Once he got inside of the house Cam realized that he was a little late because he saw most of his other friends already here.  After putting Jake’s present down with the rest of them. Can ran over to his friends who were all hanging out playing soccer outside. So cam joined in on the game. Pretty Jake’s mom called for him and said that the clown that she rented just arrived. The group of boys all ran over to see the clown there setting up the  spot for the show. Cam sat there questioning why Jake’s mom rented some clowns from that circus on the edge of town. <br />
<br />
While the clown set up the boys had Jake’s cake and watched as he opened his presents. Before long the clowns were all set up and ready for the show. The clown introduced himself Razzle the clown! Can and the rest of the boys sat at the picnic tables watching the show. Razzle started off the show by do the magic trick where they put a needle through a balloon with out popping it, and somehow actually worked.  For their next trick they would need a volunteers from the audience. After 10 seconds Cam looked around at everyone noticing that no one was raising their hands, he decided to raise his as the volunteer. When Razzle saw that jump for joy, as Cam got up and walk over towards the clown. Once Cam was standing next to Razzle, he handed Cam a Whipped cream pie with a cherry on top. He then whispered into Cam’s ear and told him to smash it right into his face. After hearing this Cam felt compelled to do so even though he didn’t want to get the cream all over his new clean black shirt. How ever as much as he tried to resist he couldn’t help himself. As he took his arms smashed the pie right square into his own face. He took the pie tin and smeared it all over himself. Once Cam dropped the tin and heard Razzle say, “Now the fun begins.”  He came to his senses realizing what he had just done. He noticed all of his were now laughing at him. Can also couldn’t help laugh at himself too. As he started to whipe the cream off of his face. Razzle took a mirror out to show cam that his face was now milky white and that the cherry was actually now suck to his nose. As he was trying to pull the cherry off of his nose m, he pulled so hard that he fell to the ground. Which made the friends and himself laugh even harder. Razzle once again took out his mirror and showed Cam what was happening to his not so dirty blond hair. What he saw was an electric blue Afro of hair on top of his head. While looking in the mirror he noticed that his eyebrows had disappeared and had been replaced with two arching black Lines above his eyes. He also saw that he now had orang and blue triangles under each eye and three black freckles on each cheek. Mean while the cherry that was stuck on his nose transformed into red rubbery clown nose with nostrils and all. All of this made Cam fall of in a fit of laughter.  After he got up he looked down at his close to see that  his “ clean” black shirt was combing with his blue shorts, and then his arm extending down to wrist. The same thing happened to his shirts which extended to be just above his ankles instead. His clothes change to be a jumpsuit that had half being red and the other half being yellow. A blue ruffle was set at the end of his wrists, ankles and neck. Looking down he was that his shows were turning the color green with red laces. Soon enough his shoes exploded to a good size 25 pair of clown shoes. <br />
<br />
Once all of the physical changes were done to Cam, his mind stayed the same besides having a tendency to be more giggly and absent minded. This was because he still had to learn how to be a clown once he got to the circus. <br />
<br />
Cam did his best to waddle over to Razzle but Razzle kept backing up and making waddle faster and fall over. Once Cam got back up Razzle introduces the 14 year old clown boy as <br />
Cambo T. Clown. Who was the rented Circus’ newest hire. <br />
<br />
Razzle let his new mentee pick who was next.</p>
