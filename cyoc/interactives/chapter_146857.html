<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The drive to Jackie’s would only be about 10 minutes, but that was long enough. Felicia, Adam, Jackie, and Ann needed to expand on their backstories and go over what would be talked about. Unfortunately, things weren’t going so well.<br />
<br />
“Why can’t I be a retired NFL player, Adam huffed. Felicia groaned, rubbing her eyes as she wearily looked back at her boyfriend. “Because that’s something Jackie’s parents can easily check,” she sighed. “How is that going to look if you say you were a pro only for them to check it out and find out your lying.”<br />
<br />
“About the same as you saying your a successful business woman,” Adam grumbled. As Felicia and Adam continued to argue Ann and Jackie could only look at eachother nervously. <br />
<br />
“This is going to be a disaster,” Ann whispered. “These two argue like a teenage couple. Your parents are going to think their nuts.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh I know,” Jackie groaned. “Just wish they were a little more mature.” As she said that an idea popped into her head. It wasn’t a great idea but desperate times called for desperate measures. Turning to her girlfriend she could see Ann give her a confused look. “What,” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Um Angel,” she said slowly. “I have an idea. Not a great idea but it could work. But it means I’m going to need your help again.”<br />
<br />
“My help,” Ann asked, still confused. “How can I help?”<br />
<br />
Jackie rubbed the back of her neck sheepishly as she now glanced at Ann. “Well those two are kind of immature,” she said quietly. “I was hoping we could well...borrow your maturity, just for a bit.”<br />
<br />
Ann’s eyes flew open as she realized the implications of what Jackie was saying. “Wait you want to take away my maturity,” she hissed. “Jackie Cmon, I already gave them my ability to drive. I don’t want to give them more of my adulthood.”<br />
<br />
“Look I know it’s a lot to give up but please Angel I want this to work.”<br />
<br />
Ann furrowed her brow before sighing. She wanted this to work too, if she and Jackie were going to see eachother than she would have to make some sacrifices along the way. “Okay fine,” she sighed. “But this better be temporary. I already feel like enough of a kid.” Jackie promised, giving Ann a quick peck on the lips before focusing on her ring.<br />
<br />
Ann held her breath as she waited for the magic to engulf her. What would losing her maturity be like? She remembered that when she was a teen the first time she had not been the most confident person in the world. Would she become that girl again, only this time it would be worse since she would remember her adult self?<br />
<br />
Ann gazed over at Felicia and Adam. At first she thought that the fight the two were having seemed petty. The professions they were coming up with were fictitious, something that wouldn’t matter in the long run. As she listened to them though she began to become more interested in what they were saying. Of course it was important, it was their lives whether it was make beleive or not. <br />
<br />
Ann gasped, what the hell was she thinking. Quickly she now tried to think of her adult life. As she did she realized her job was so boring, sitting in board rooms or a big stuffy office. Ann wanted to paint, to explore her artistic life. Shaking her head Ann began to realize she was losing her maturity, it almost felt like she was becoming younger by the second just sitting there.<br />
<br />
Blushing Ann now shyly gazed at Jackie. It amazed her that the two had bonded the way that they had. As Ann thought back she had been surprised she had made the first move. Ann was usually quite shy. As she now looked at Jackie she could feel her cheeks burn with embarrassment. She was such a geek, why would anyone ever want to date her or.... Ann hugged her body as she thought back to the night Jackie had visited her apartment. The grown down adult remember d what the two had done in her bedroom. How could she do that? She wasn’t ready to do those types of things in a relationship.<br />
<br />
Jackie had watched Ann intently and began to notice the teen changing. Jackie could slowly see Ann’s adult confidence being stripped away from her as her maturity level dropped. The girl seemed to withdraw into herself becoming meeker and shyer with each passing second. When Ann shyly looked over Jackie it surprised her to see the blond goth girl blush crimson before averting her eyes. Taking the girls hand Jackie was surprised to see she startled Ann, her hand clammy in her own. “Ann you feeling okay?”<br />
<br />
“I think your stupid spell worked,” Ann said meekly. “Definitely feeling like I did at 15.”<br />
<br />
Jackie gave Ann a warm smile as she went to place a tender kiss on the teens lips she was surprised to see Ann give her a look of shock. “Sorry,” Ann stammered. “I.um, wasn’t very experienced at 15. I would kind of freak out whenever someone tried to kiss me.”<br />
<br />
“it’s okay,” Jackie soothed. “This will only be temporary.”<br />
<br />
“I really hope so cause right now I feel like super awkward.”<br />
<br />
As the two teens looked towards the front they could see Adam and Felicia had finished argueing. The middle age couple now appeared more rational, talking strategy as they pulled into Jackie’s driveway. “So we keep it simple but vague,” Adam stated. Felicia nodded before turning towards Ann and Jackie. “Don’t worry you two,” she smiled. “Well make sure this works.”<br />
<br />
As the four approached the door, they were surprised when Hannah and Frank opened it before they reached the door. “Hi Mr. and Mrs. O’Toole,” Hannah said. “Hope you didn’t have any trouble finding the place.”<br />
<br />
“No trouble at all,” Adam said. “Your daughter gave us excellent directions.”<br />
<br />
Frank smiled, escorting the two adults into the living room where they took a seat on the couch. “Jackie has always been the responsible one,” Hannah said warmly. “And Ann seems so mature for her age. She really impressed us the last time she was here.”<br />
<br />
Jackie stifled a giggle as Ann blushed. “Ann has always been a good girl,” Felicia said proudly. “And when she told us you wanted to meet us we couldn’t have been more excited. I think we can both agree we want what’s best of these two.” Hannah and Frank smiled, glancing towards the girls as they continued to engage in small talk.<br />
<br />
“Think it’s going great so far,” she whispered to Ann. “Looks like it,” Ann said meekly. “But I’m feeling really weird just standing here. Can we go somewhere else? Anywhere else?”<br />
<br />
Jackie nodded as she now tried to get her parents attention. The parents seemed to be getting along great but she wanted to put Ann at ease. “Hey mom, dad,” she asked. “Can me and Ann...”</p>
