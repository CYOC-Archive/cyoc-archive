<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean and Jeff left Ray’s house, but not before Rex managed a few more licks to Lucky’s cunt and letting her know how much he would miss his mate. Ray suggested letting Lucky stay the night, and when Lucky saw that Rex was beginning to show a little red coming out of his sheath and caught a whiff of the scent coming from between Rex’s legs, she briefly considered it. Dean declined though, saying maybe another time.<br />
<br />
The whole walk home, Jeff did not stop berating Dean for what he had done. She didn’t stop when they got home, as they walked up the stairs, or even as they got to Dean’s room.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you did that!” Jeff barked. “You made me a bitch! You put me in heat! You watched as a DOG fucked me! A DOG Dean! How could you do that!” <br />
<br />
“Relax buddy” Dean said, reaching to give Jeff a scratch behind the ear. Jeff recoiled and almost snapped at Dean.<br />
<br />
“RELAX?! He came in me Dean! That DOG came in me! What if I’m pregnant! How long are dogs pregnant?! Am I just going to be a pregnant bitch for the rest of the month! How could you not think that through! Can I even change back until I… *gulp* give BIRTH?! Jesus Dean! I trusted you and it only took you two days to…”<br />
<br />
“JEFF. RE. LAX. You are not pregnant.” Dean assured her.<br />
<br />
“Oh how would you know?” Jeff demanded.<br />
<br />
“Because you’re sterile.” Dean replied.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widened a bit. “I’m what?”<br />
<br />
“Sterile. I made you female, in heat, and sterile. All of the fuck around without any of the find out.” Dean smirked.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Jeff huffed. “Well, okay. That’s fine. But DEAN! A dog FUCKED me. How will I look myself in the mirror after this! This is so degrading Dean!”<br />
<br />
“You’re a dog too *Lucky*, come here and sit.” Dean commanded. Despite how angry Jeff was, she complied. Dean started to scratch behind his dog’s ear. “Plus, you liked it.”<br />
<br />
“…no I didn’t” Jeff said. She would have blushed if she could.<br />
<br />
“Come on. Did you forget I understand your barks while Rex was in you? I heard every bit of your half of that conversation. You. Liked. It.” Dean laughed.<br />
<br />
“It’s just because you put me in heat! It’s like an ache, or an itch you can’t scratch!” Jeff barked, trying to defend herself.<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re still in heat. Do you still have the itch?” Dean asked.<br />
<br />
“…a bit. It’s different when I can smell a male dog. Having Rex there made it like 10 times worse.” Jeff barked.<br />
<br />
“Since you know you’re sterile now, would you want to scratch the itch again? I’m sure we could find another male German Shepherd around here.” Dean smiled.<br />
<br />
“…what?” Jeff barked, contemplating the idea. “Where?” Dean cocked an eyebrow at Jeff. “YOU!” Jeff howled, backing away from Dean with her tail between her legs. “YOU want to fuck me!”<br />
<br />
“Well no, obviously not right now. But I feel like a little bad after doing that to you without asking. Plus, I’m guessing if I’m on all fours and got a good whiff of your cunt I wouldn’t need much convincing.” Dean said, smiling at Jeff.<br />
<br />
“No, Dean. No. I don’t want you to fuck me.” Jeff huffed.<br />
<br />
“Okay okay okay. It was just a suggestion. Here, let me fix your situation then.” Dean said. He pulled his phone out and opened the Chronivac app. Jeff eyed him suspiciously as he typed. Dean pressed enter, and Jeff felt a warmth pulse between her hind legs. With a grunt, she felt testicles descend from her vagina. Jeff looked between her front legs and watched as what she assumed was her clit grew back into his red rocket and was enveloped in a fuzzy sheath. Jeff heard a ding from Dean’s phone and felt another pulse of warmth around his genitals. He felt his testicles plump a bit, and a pleasurable growth in his sheath as both it and his penis inched their way up his belly. He ruffed at Dean quizzically. “Just a bit of an ‘I’m sorry’ for earlier today.” Dean said. Jeff barked in approval. Though Dean wasn’t finished. He kept typing on his phone. He set the phone down and stood. He removed his shirt, socks, pants, and underwear, then clicked confirm on his phone.<br />
<br />
“Whaaa…” Jeff mumbled, cocking his head to the side. Dean’s ears grew furry and pointy, moving to the top of his head. His face stretched out into a muzzle. His fingers shrank inward, he grew pads on the palms of his hands, now paws, his arms shortened, a black and tan tail grew out from just above his ass, his legs and hips shifted, pitching him forward onto all fours. His balls shrank as a new opening formed, his penis shrinking and withdrawing within his new opening as well. Black and tan fur grew out all over Dean’s back and sides while cream colored fur covered her now barrel shaped chest and belly.<br />
<br />
“There we go.” Dean barked. “Two hours. Since you didn’t seem keen on getting fucked, I figure the next best way to make it up to you is to let you fuck me a couple of times.” She leaned forward and licked Jeff’s nose. Dean whined, “Jesus, you’re right. This thing IS itchy! And I feel so empty. Come on stud,” Dean barked, turning to present herself to Jeff, “Fill me up.”<br />
<br />
“Dean… I…” Jeff stuttered. “I… don’t think… I mean, you want me to fuck you? I don’t think I feel…” he mumbled, even as his penis began to emerge from his sheath. “I mean, we’re friends Dean. I don’t feel that way about you and, I don’t think...”<br />
<br />
Dean huffed and turned back to face Jeff. “For crying out loud Jeff. I’m not asking you to be my boyfriend. This is just sex. Animal, hormone driven sex. In a couple of hours I’ll be a man again and you’ll be my dog. By the end of the month, you’re human again and we’re buds. Right now, I’m a bitch in heat that can’t get pregnant and you’re a stud with about half of your cock sticking out of your sheath. Now, I know having to deal with this heat for two hours without your help is a different kind of ‘making it up to you’ than I planned, but that doesn’t sound like fun for either of us.” Dean lowered herself and crawled back between Jeff’s hind legs, sniffing around Jeff’s sheath and balls. “Jesus, you do smell good Jeff.” She continued to sniff. “I can see why you let Rex fuck you like that. My cunt feels like it’s on fire and dripping wet at the same time. Are you sure you…” Dean trailed off, giving Jeff a lick from his balls to the tip of his exposed penis. “…don’t want to fuck me?”<br />
<br />
“Uhhohohoh Dean, I do. I want to fuck you. But why do you want to get fucked? Isn’t that…” Jeff was cut off with another lick from Dean. “Unnngh… fuck. Isn’t this degrading for you?”<br />
<br />
Dean removed herself from between Jeff’s legs and stood facing him again. “Maybe a bit, but what I did to you was too. Besides, it looked and sounded like you were having fun with Rex. Why should I let you have all the fun with this app?” She said, once again turning to present her cunt to Jeff, tail raised high.<br />
<br />
Jeff huffed a laugh. “You naughty bitch,” he said, and began lapping at Dean’s cunt.<br />
--<br />
**Meanwhile at Ray’s**<br />
<br />
Ray and Kyle sat on the couch playing video games while Rex lay curled up on the floor enjoying a post-sex nap. Ray’s phone dinged. The fur on Rex’s body began to recede. His tail shrank back into his body. His legs grew, reshaped, and gained muscle. Paws grew fingers and pads grew back into his palms. His ears shrank as his muzzle shrank back into his face. His nose turned pink, and the fur on his head grew out into curly brown hair. Nick awoke from his nap, fully transformed back into a naked 18 year old man and Ray and Kyle’s roommate.<br />
<br />
Nick stretched, then moved to sit with his back against the couch his friends sat on. “Man, that was wild. I can’t believe you let me fuck a dog” he said. “Were you really going to let her stay the night so I could fuck her over and over? What if I had gotten her pregnant?! Oh God, what if I DID get her pregnant?!”<br />
<br />
Kyle quipped, “Then you’re going to be a dad buddy! Congratulations!” Nick hit him in the shin.<br />
<br />
Ray laughed. “Don’t worry about it man. You were sterile. I made sure of it when Dean told me Lucky was in heat.”<br />
<br />
“Oh” Nick said. “Well, that’s good. I don’t think I would want to know I have puppies running around out there somewhere. But I thought that was just a playdate. Did you know Lucky was in heat?”<br />
<br />
“Actually, no.” Ray said. “When I told Dean about Rex I did think it was just a playdate for you. I thought that you and Lucky would romp around the backyard for a bit, then when they left I was going to make Kyle a bitch for you so you got the full doggy experience. You think he would have mentioned he was trying to get his dog pregnant, huh?”<br />
<br />
“WHAT!” Kyle exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“What if Dean brings her by for round two and Rex isn’t here?” Nick asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure we could put you back on all fours for a second date buddy” Ray said.<br />
<br />
“Were you planning on telling me about this, or were you just going to zap me into a dog for him to fuck?!” Kyle asked indignantly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, calm down.” Ray said. “You never complain when we put on fur coats and you fuck me. I think it’s about time you experience it from the other end of the knot.” Kyle harrumphed and rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“So then I’m just fucking this dog over and over firing blanks while this Dean guy is hoping I get her pregnant at some point?” Nick scoffed.<br />
<br />
“…do you want puppies?” Kyle asked.<br />
<br />
“What! No!” Nick exclaimed. “It just seems mean to get this guy’s hopes up.”<br />
<br />
“It’s just one missed heat, not a big deal in the scheme of things.” Ray said. “She’ll be in heat again in no time, and then if Dean still wants to try he can find another stud dog that isn’t firing blanks. Meanwhile, Rex gets a bunch of guilt free sex.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess when you put it like that it’s not so bad.” Nick said.<br />
<br />
“Do you want me to call Dean and set up a second date? Maybe he would reconsider letting Lucky spend the night tonight” Ray said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Nick blushed. “…maybe.”<br />
<br />
Ray laughed. “I’ll call Dean. Maybe Kyle and I will join in after he drops her off.”</p>
