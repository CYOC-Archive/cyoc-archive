<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter quickly got bored of his game. There wasn&#39;t anything to do here. How his twin siblings could be entertained was beyond him. His jerk brother had left to &quot; go use the bathroom&quot; ten minutes ago but he knew that was a lie. He wasn&#39;t going to tell his mom if he hadn&#39;t come back by the time she checked in on them. That would only get him in trouble with his brother, who would probably beet him up for it. They were only four years apart in age but Alex was so much stronger and bigger and taller than him. And the worse part was it didn&#39;t seem like Peter had gotten any of the good genes either. He was barely taller than his twin brothers, he was almost half the weight of his older brother and still shorter than his mother. When he would hit puberty and if it would actually make him into a man was a big IF.<br />
<br />
Peter had to do something and he didn&#39;t want to make his mother mad by leaving. But it was so so so so so so so so boring waiting around for some stimulus. He tried calling over his brothers but they were both hooked into the computer and ignored him. He then decided that he would go find Morgan and Zack. He loved his two younger sibling more than the others.<br />
<br />
He went out of the room and went down the hallway they came by. He remembered that they went down the hallway, took a left, then a right, then went down a hallway and took a right. Or was it right left right, or left left right. He was concentrating so hard on remembering that he was walking down a different hallway by mistake. He retraced his steps and went back to the intersection where he originally turned off from. Except that this intersection had three hallways instead of the other one which had four. He chose the one in front of him but that didn&#39;t go anywhere. He then thought about getting a map. A stairwell usually had a map incase of a fire so he kept looking for exit signs. He looked for five minutes and was surprised that no employees had seen him. He found a stairwell but no fire evacuation map. He went down a flight of stairs to see if that floor entrance had a map; none, next one down; none, next one down; none. He finally went down at least seven flights of stairs but couldn&#39;t find a map. He had actually lost count of how many stairs he had gone down. He went up at least five floors and through the door but was greeted by a totally different color scheme. He was in fact lost.<br />
<br />
Peter began to panic, he ran through the building looking for anyone to help him, he was scared. He knew he was going to get in trouble with his mom, and his brother. He was going to get punched he knew it. He kept running and running past rows and rows of rooms. He found himself on the other side of the building. He ran back to the stairwell and turned a corner until he ran into someone. Peter was almost about to start crying he was so confused and scared.<br />
When he looked up he was met with a tall built man in all black holding a long stick. <br />
&quot; Did you think we wouldn&#39;t see you running off?&quot; the man said as he pointed the stick at his stomach.<br />
&quot; No sir. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t mean to run into you. Can you please help me get out of here?&quot; he begged looking up with the man hoping he could direct him to his mom&#39;s office.<br />
&quot; You are really bad at stealing if you can get caught this easily and then think I&#39;m stupid enough to help you. Nice cloths by the way, I wonder how you managed to find those and in your size. Doesn&#39;t matter though time to head back downstairs, can&#39;t have you leaving Konstantin. &quot; He said with the stick starting to hum.<br />
&quot; I&#39;m not Konstantin. I&#39;m lost. My name is-&quot; he was cut short as the stick poked him in the chest and he blacked out. <br />
<br />
When Peter woke up he was in a plain white room and he couldn&#39;t move. He couldn&#39;t even turn his head.</p>
