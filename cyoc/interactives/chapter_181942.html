<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a guy with a big manly frame and country muscles, Mason had a rather small and underwhelming dick.<br />
<br />
Janette felt her entire body deflate of excitement as Mason presented his micropenis to her. The big expensive lift kitted truck, the straight pipe that made it so loud, and his reckless speeding all suddenly made sense. He’d been compensating for something and she’d fallen for it.<br />
<br />
“Oh...” she trailed.<br />
<br />
“Pretty impressive right?” Mason asked and she wasn’t sure if he was actually that stupid. He did look and sound like a redneck after all. His clothes were all dirty, his apartment was filthy, and there was a ton of booze in that room. He even reached over and poured her a drink without asking her first. She grinned awkwardly at him, suddenly realizing he wasn’t some dreamy country boy but a filthy southern hick that had a strong body because his mind was so dumb he couldn’t do anything else.<br />
<br />
“Maybe he’ll look better with some booze,” Janette mumbled into her drink before downing it, then, without asking permission first, Mason grabbed her shirt and pulled it off her body.<br />
<br />
“What are you-“ she started before he unclasped her bra and began to roughly handle her breasts. Once she was properly discheveled he spun her around, pulled down her pants and she went wide eyed. “At least use a condom!”<br />
<br />
He plunged his tiny dick into her and she grit her teeth in pain as he roughly handled her. He thrust his hips into her rear painfully, he jolted her wildly and uncomfortably, and he didn’t even last two minutes. A pathetic trickle of cum poured into her vagina, glowing pink and making her shudder uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
“Aw lord, I ain’t supposed to have sex unless I’m married,” Janette drawled before covering her mouth. The air in the room turned hot and suddenly the place was clean and tidy, because of course it was, that was her job as a woman.<br />
<br />
“What?!” Her mind shrieked but it was too late, that semen had leaked into her vagina and absorbed into the walls. She opened her mouth wide, feeling pleasured by Mason’s dick. It was the only dick she’d ever seen after all. A good Christian girl like herself kept herself pure until marriage. She was married to Mason after all, done it right the second they’d both turned eighteen. Course she would’ve waited for high school to finish but neither of ‘em had finished it.<br />
<br />
A ring appeared on her finger and her body began to change, her hair turned a reddish blonde and fell loosely around her head. She always put effort into her appearance, hair and clothes included. She dressed neatly on dates with her husband while he wore jeans, a cowboy hat, and a dusty and filthy tee. It was how men dressed. She was supposed to put effort in, that was her duty as a wife.<br />
<br />
Her hips flared out to an impressive child bearing size, ready to push out as many little angels as god decided to bless them with. Her figure was overall an attractive pear shaped thing and she smiled while running hands down it. Her husband had just given her another load of cum that would hopefully finally get her pregnant. She didn’t like being twenty one without a kid yet, all her friends had babies already, so why not her? She didn’t believe in contraceptives so she’d never used a condom or anything and yet her sinful friends had been blessed before her.<br />
<br />
They were in their bedroom out on the farm, Mason was the youngest of six kids and while his older brother was inheritin’ the farm Mason was sticking round to help him with it. Lot better than his good fer nuthin middle brother who’d gone off to the city and left the country behind. Family rumour was he’d turned into a Democrat and started dating a Mexican girl who’d no doubt come to America illegally.<br />
<br />
Mason already had nephews with his eldest brother and she wanted to give him a son of his own he’d be able to show how to shoot guns and drink beer with.<br />
<br />
“Come on baby,” she drawled in her heavy southern accent. “Fill me with one more try tonight. I only got so long I can have children anyhow.”<br />
<br />
“Ah shit Janette, I’m tryin but I don’t know how this all works, it’s women’s stuff,” Mason replied before sticking his penis back inside her and beginning to grind her again. He had his way with his women again and gave a small spurt of cum after another five minutes of trying.<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should pray a little harder,” Janette suggested.<br />
<br />
“Ah’ve given five hundred bucks already to that there pastor we see on the TV. Ah’m startin to think he might be lyin,” Mason admitted.<br />
<br />
“You stop being so blasphemous,” his wife barked at him. “God will give us a nice baby in time. Who knows, maybe this is the time...”</p>
