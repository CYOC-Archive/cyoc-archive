<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie would have to say her daughters wedding was both the best of times and the worst of times. After successfully rescuing her son the group returned to the hotel. Despite several serious injuries to Cole Harris, Rexie, and Ayami, everyone was okay.<br />
<br />
After returning to the hotel everyone involved was on it on edge, so much so that most of Kellies friends returned to the other timeline. Only Jack, Kellie, and their daughter Ann remained. Kellie and Jack both admitted the ceremony and reception was beautiful. Katie and her now wife Kellie looked magnificent in their wedding gowns. As soon as the reception ended though Jack, Kellie, and teen Ann had to return to their timeline.<br />
<br />
Kellies timeline was on edge since Shizen&#39;s injuries. While the divine kitsune had survived, she was in critical condition. Mika now seemed to split her time between the kitsune home and her own. Kellie was growing concerned as she could see Mika appeared quite distracted lately. Hopefully she would get a chance to talk with her soon, for now though she found herself taking care of her newborn son.<br />
<br />
The boy, much to everyone&#39;s surprise, was a very good baby. The child amazingly slept mostly through the night and amazingly was not a burden to either Merlin or Kellie. Kellie was now home, waiting for Jack to arrive. The teenage couple trying their best to raise the child together despite living apart. A soft knock at the door now drew Kellies attention. Placing her sleeping son inside his bassinet, Kellie opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika,&quot; she said curiously. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika gave her friend a sad smile as she now stood on her doorstep. Since the wedding and her kitsune mothers injury she had found herself stretched thin. Tensions were high amongst the kitsune. Fukushus actions had both United and divided the clan. Most of his followers had left his side, returning to the clan albeit withal suspicious glance in their direction. Others though had fled to Fukushus side. While those numbers were few, it did concern the clan. &quot;Hey Kellie mind if I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure cmon in,&quot; Kellie said quickly. &quot;Just keep the noise down, the baby&#39;s sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika nodded, making her way inside she glanced over at the sleeping baby. &quot;Thanks for seeing me,&quot; Mika said. &quot;Things have been a bit crazy lately. By the way hows the baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty is doing great,&quot; Kellie said happily. &quot;Wish Katie had been this easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys named him Ty,&quot; Mika asked raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack likes the name,&quot; Kellie chuckled. &quot;He thinks it has alot of power to it. Whatever Ty&#39;s power is, we&#39;re going to make sure hes always cared for.&quot; Kellie now glanced back at her kitsune friend, seeing the worry on her face. &quot;So is everything alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things have been a little crazy,&quot; Mika sighed. &quot;Mother is still in intensive care and father has been by her side ever since. Hes inconsolable right now, I&#39;ve never seen him so sad. It&#39;s kind of why I need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you need,&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister Kiko has stepped in since mothers injuries,&quot; Mika stated. &quot;Shes acting lady of the house. Recently Jack approached me. It looks like Lilith wants to form an alliance with my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie gawked at Mika. Lilith wanted to form an alliance with the kitsune?! After everything that had happened it seemed like an impossibility. Also Kellie was surprised to hear Mika had even more family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mika two things,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;One. Lilith! What brought that on and two how many siblings do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have quite a few brothers and sisters,&quot; Mikabsaid matter of factly. &quot;Hikari, Yomi, and Fukushu were the oldest. Hikari would have been the one to step in as Lady of the clan in this instance. However that&#39;s an impossibility now so the duty fell to Kiko. Shes....different. Very sweet and friendly but so not ready for important negotiations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you think Lilith is actually sincere,&quot; Kellie asked, raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Mika sighed, her shoulders slumping as she now raised her eyes to Kellie. &quot;I dont know,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I mean she&#39;s changed but still, shes the queen of demons. I cant chance something happening and I need your help. Whether you know it or not all sides respect you. If you and the others are there, I think Lilith is less likely to try anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie agreed of course. After asking Merlin to watch Ty, Kellie and her friends followed Mika to the area where they would be able to travel to the land of the kitsune. Mika smiled as she now welcomed her friends. &quot;So how does this work,&quot; Katie asked as they studied the clearing they now stood in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its actually not that hard,&quot; Kumi smiled. &quot;This is where me and Mika go everytime we travel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but Mika and Kumi are the ones that know the spell,&quot; Claudia added. &quot;They&#39;re the ones that can open the portal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thays because the magic can only be performed by a kitsune or the family of a kitsune,&quot; Mika stated. &quot;Its kind of like blood magic. A natural defense so none of our enemies can attack us in our home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So hate to ask but how is this going to work,&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to bring you to our home,&quot; Mika said. &quot;I want you to meet everyone before we bring Lilith.&quot; Kellie and the others nodded in agreement, it was probably a good idea to get acquainted with everyone before Lilith and the others arrived. &quot;Okay Mika whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika nodded, closing her eyes as she now began to cast the spell. Kellie couldnt quite understand what she was saying as Mika spoke in Japanese. Kellie now watched as the girl shifted into her kitsune form, her tail flame making intricate symbols. Finally the kitsune teen clapped her hands, causing a tear to appear in the very fabric of reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Karen whispered.<br />
<br />
Mika smirked, turning towards her friends as she gestured for them to enter. &quot;Welcome to my clans home.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Kellie and the others entered their jaws dropped. Tatsu and Shizens home was beautiful. A mixture of feudal Japaneese culture and modern society. Small Japanese bungalows lined paved roads that led to a central Shinto shrine in the middle of town. As Kellie took in her surroundings she was blown away by its beauty.<br />
<br />
Cherry blossoms in full blown lined the streets, leading to a magnificent palace that she presumed belonged to Mikas parents. These feudal aspects mixed in surprisingly well with the modern amenities of the town.<br />
<br />
Kellie could see young kits, happily playing a park, watched by three and four tailed kitsunes who appeared dressed in the latest fashion. Kellie noticed other kitsune milling around town as well.<br />
<br />
A pair of two tailed kitsune teenagers, with dyed fur were mindlessly scrolling through cellphones dressed in punk clothing. An elderly seven tails dressed in a traditional kimono pushed a small infant in a modern stroller with a five tailed female who appeared dressed for a business meeting. Kellie could even see a pair of young four tails who appeared to be athletes heading towards the gym. The four tails were surprising wearing fitbits and the latest workout fashions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Kellie said in awe. &quot;Was not expecting this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what were you expecting,&quot; Mika asked, a smug smile plastered on her face. Kellie could only shrug. &quot;Not sure but still this place is beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika thanked her friend as they now proceeded down the road. The group drawing some odd looks as they traveled. &quot;I dont think they like us,&quot; Mary Elise said quietly as she noticed the stares.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not used to mortals,&quot; Mika said. As the group now walked further into town they could see a kitsune excitedly wave at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiko,&quot; Mika exclaimed happily as she rushed to hug the six tails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey little sis,&quot; Kiko said happily. &quot;So happy you made it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie gawked at the six tail kitsune, stunned by her appearance. The six tails fur was rushed in color, with some rainbow streaks running through it. Kiko also appeared quite taken with colorful clothes, a bright sky blue t shirt complete with sparkly capris pants. &quot;So these your friends Mika?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah this is them,&quot; Mika said, gesturing towards her friends. Kellie and the others bowed, causing the six tail to chuckle softly. &quot;Geez so formal,&quot; she laughed. &quot;Guessing you&#39;ve only ever dealt with mom and pop. Not all of us are so formal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kellie said sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey no worries,&quot; Kiko said happily. &quot;Speaking of the folks was on my way to see them. They&#39;ll be so happy to see all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is mother,&quot; Mika asked. Kiko&#39;s smile seemed to falter slightly as she let out a deep breath. &quot;Moms still unconscious,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;The doctors arent sure when she&#39;ll wake up or if. Dad hasnt left her side since they came back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika nodded as the group now followed the bubbly six tail. As they did Kellie pulled Mika aside, she had so many questions. &quot;That&#39;s your older sister?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you Kiko was different,&quot; Mika sighed. &quot;Shes a bit of a free spirit. I mean shes a ray of sunshine, always brightens up the room but I&#39;m worried she may not be the beat diplomat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie could only nod in response, it seemed like their time in the land of the kitsunes would certainly be interesting.</p>
