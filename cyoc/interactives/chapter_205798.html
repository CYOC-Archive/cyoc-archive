<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I didn’t sleep a wink that night. The men had cleaned up Jimbo’s mess but I didn’t dare go near that part of our glass cell. I tossed in my bed, either facing in towards the locked metal door or out to the complete darkness. Arthur slept on the bed opposite to me, fast asleep and on the brink of snoring. I focused my mind, controlled my breathing, and shut my eyes. Clasping for any semblance of sleep, I felt scared. Scared like a student waiting outside the headmaster’s office. Scared like a death row inmate on their final night. Only what was waiting for me come morning wasn’t a telling off, or death.<br />
<br />
It was Orientation.<br />
<br />
Arthur couldn’t tell me much about Orientation, only that it’s the initiation for the staff of the manor. It’s different for each role. The sun rose through the morning hours, gently sweeping away the darkness. I realised what surrounded us was nothing nefarious, but rather a quaint flower garden. Petals of all shapes and sizes were leaning towards us, as if to say good morning. I rather enjoyed the peaceful scene, until a tinny siren filled our ears. Arthur collapsed out of bed and got to his knees, reaching for a pair of stained black boots underneath. He grunted as he tried to shove his feet into them as quickly as possible, his biceps flexing underneath the patches of oil.<br />
<br />
“You have to be quick. They don’t like it when you’re not in full uniform,” he said without looking in my direction.<br />
<br />
“Full uniform? Oh!”<br />
<br />
I jumped and sprang towards the small pile of clothes by the door. I was too scared to touch them when one of the men had put them there, but the adrenaline flew all caution out of the window. I picked up the shirt and dungarees and briskly changed. I looked around if anyone was watching me. Thankfully Arthur was too busy trying to stuff his arms into the sleeves of his coveralls. The dungarees felt baggy, like they were a few sizes too big. After I tied the laces of my shoe I stood by Arthur, and we faced the metal door with intense anticipation.<br />
<br />
“Remember the plan?” he asked, turning his head to face me. He looked a lot less scared than I was.<br />
<br />
“Gather intel, find a way out, report our findings back here tonight,” I answered.<br />
“And don’t get caught.”<br />
“Right.”<br />
<br />
The door suddenly swung open and two of the men entered the room. Their frames were so large they casted a shadow over the stone floor. Their uniforms looked immaculate, well-kept and not a spot of imperfection on them. Their crotches looked more enticing the more times I saw them. Their fists were clenched. They still maintained a generous layer of stubble which hugged their jaws. I looked at one of them and felt a harsh sting of defeat.<br />
<br />
It was Jimbo.<br />
<br />
He was big, and manly, but I knew it was him. I’d never forget the night before. He was the one that spoke, something I had yet to witness one of them do. His voice was even deeper than when we last heard it.<br />
<br />
“The Gardener is with me. The Mechanic will wait here.”<br />
<br />
I saw Arthur mouth ‘Good Luck’ to me before Jimbo gestured for us to leave. He followed closely behind me, shutting the door. Just before he did, I noticed the man standing in front of Arthur reach for something in his trousers. Then, my only ally was out of sight, and Jimbo pushed my shoulder firmly.<br />
<br />
“Move.”<br />
<br />
I whimpered at the strength of his push. I thought it was best not to test him. I walked down the corridor, through the only open door. I was as silent as I could be, feeling the piercing stare of the man behind me. In each room  we entered there was only one open door. I was too scared to try and go through a closed one, especially considering how close behind me Jimbo was. He looked like he didn’t recognise me, or Arthur, at all. Still, I knew it was him. He had to be in there, somewhere. I had to try something.<br />
<br />
“Jimbo, I—“<br />
“My name is not Jimbo.”<br />
<br />
His response was monotonous and quick, as if he memorised it. I continued.<br />
<br />
“What is your name then?”<br />
“I am nameless. My purpose is to serve the Master.”<br />
“What does the Master want?”<br />
“Master has many wants.”<br />
“Name one.”<br />
<br />
Then I felt his two large hands fall on my shoulders. I froze as his fingers gently squeezed. I could feel him lean in, pressing his chest and crotch against my back. His body was so hot, and I mean that literally. Almost scorching. I held my breath. The silence was deafening, until he whispered right into my ear with a menacing tone.<br />
<br />
“The world.”<br />
<br />
He leaned back and I could breathe again. He pushed me again to keep walking until we strolled right past a wooden door in a dull-looking corridor.<br />
<br />
“Stop. In here.”<br />
<br />
A beautiful emerald green insignia of a sickle and three strands of wheat was carved into the door, which opened with a light squeak. Inside was a room no bigger than a storage room. A single light dangled flimsily in the centre, so dim the walls were shrouded in darkness. A dark green carpet stretched from the door to a pedestal at the very end. On it was a wooden box, almost exactly identical to the one Locksteed held in the dining room.<br />
<br />
The one that contained the pill that changed Jimbo.<br />
<br />
I began to shake as Jimbo pushed me closer to the pedestal. He told me to stand still as he opened the box. Inside was a pill, but one of a greenish hue instead of the blue one Jimbo took. The insignia on the door was also stamped on the pill. He picked it up and stood right in front of me. A few stranded of his thick chest hair was poking through his buttoned shirt. His cock was within arm’s reach. I felt myself getting turned on at how close we were.<br />
<br />
“Open,”  he said.<br />
<br />
Taking one look at his burly arms, I knew I couldn’t overpower him. There was no escape. Accepting my fate, I opened my mouth and Jimbo dropped the pill in. I didn’t even need to swallow; it fell straight down the back of my throat. I felt it slide deeper into my body. I braced for the oncoming changes, biting my lips with dread, but after a few seconds, nothing happened. I felt completely normal. I almost let out a relieved laugh until—<br />
<br />
“Open,” he said again.<br />
<br />
I opened wide again but before I could react he lunged towards me, ramming his tongue as far into my mouth as he could. His arms wrapped around me and before I knew it his hands lay flat on my ass, pushing me further into his thick, muscley torso. He practically lifted me off the ground with his strength as he continued to vigorously make out with me. I didn’t know how to react. I flailed my arms about until they rested on his shoulders, then his neck, and then his cheeks. My fingers trailed along his jaw, reaching over and pushing his hair out of place. <br />
<br />
I realised I wasn’t pulling away, rather leaning into the kiss. I watched my wondering hands slide down his chest, eagerly grabbing the swelling manhood between his thighs. He did the same, and I shivered with pleasure as he gripped my crotch. I couldn’t think. In the moment, it was like my body was on autopilot. I forgot about the mission, about Arthur. All I cared about was that moment. A moment I didn’t want to end. I wanted him to fuck me so badly.<br />
<br />
However, when my cock was fully hard in his grip, he quickly pushed away, taking two steps back into the darkness. I almost fell when he let go, looking at him with confusion and a twinge of vitriol for ending that moment. Then, I looked down at my crotch. I could feel a warmth emanating from it, getting hotter by the second. Once I came to my senses I realised it had grown a few inches, bulging out of the dungarees. I was lost for words. The heat then spread to my legs. I pressed my hands against my thighs, and they were exceedingly hot. I looked back up at Jimbo who quietly watched on neatly pushing his hair back and re-adjusting his manhood which had softened back to its one-foot length.<br />
<br />
Then, I gazed with fear as my thighs swelled beneath my hands. They grew thicker, tightening the fabric of the overalls. They were so muscular they rubbed against each other as I took a step back in shock. The heat slowly trickled down to my calves, which grew with muscle. It didn’t hurt, quite the opposite. It was like a hundred hands were soothing my legs, massaging them. It wasn’t until the heat traveled to my ass did I start to enjoy it. My cheeks ballooned, and I couldn’t help but moan as they did. They felt so sensitive that went I squeezed them my body jolted with pleasure. I couldn’t believe it; I had the lower half of a champion cyclist!<br />
<br />
Then the heat slithered up to my arms, and they grew a modest amount. I still stared with glee as they grew to slightly bigger than Arthur’s; toned with some bulk in the biceps. The heat briefly made its way to my chest and two pecs began to push through, but stopped before they become fully defined. After that, the heat dissipated, and I stood there with an almost entirely new physique. Gone was my meagre, frail frame. I tested out my legs by squatting, surprised by how easy it was to do. I flexed my bicep and indulged in the sight of it trying to break free from the white cotton shirt sleeves.<br />
<br />
I still had my memories though. I was still me. I hadn’t become one of the men like Jimbo; I didn’t grow in height nor was I anywhere near as muscular as them. Still, it felt good. Great, even. My hardon refused to die down. Jimbo slowly took a step out of the darkness when my growth had stopped.<br />
<br />
“The garden is this way,” he said with the same monotone voice.<br />
<br />
He acted as if our kiss didn’t happen, and pushed me to go out the room and back into the hallway. I noticed an open door, and so we were back to traversing the manor. We walked passed a mirror and I was able to look at myself just for a brief moment. My face was still the same, only fuller looking, like my new muscles had made my face more attractive. I loved how I looked.<br />
<br />
My thighs rubbed together as I walked. I wanted to test them out properly. I hoped the garden would be that test. Maybe being staff here wouldn’t be too bad, I thought. But then reason had returned. Keep it together.<br />
<br />
‘Remember the plan. Don’t get caught.’</p>
