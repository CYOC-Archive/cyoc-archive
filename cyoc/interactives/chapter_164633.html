<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">WEDNESDAY (PM) - ONE MONTH LATER<br />
<br />
Peter and Lauren lay outside on deck chairs as they gazed up at the stars. It was a full moon that night and they decided to spend it outdoors in each other&#39;s company. It had been an entire month since the fair had been through town, but as time passed, so did the thoughts from their minds. They sat close to one another sharing a large blanket to shelter from the cold as the discussed trivial topics.<br />
<br />
&quot;The moon&#39;s so beautiful tonight...&quot; Lauren said as she stared at it intently. She didn&#39;t know why at the time, but a warm feeling had begun to spread through her chest. She felt almost light headed, though she shook it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I agree. I don&#39;t know why but tonight&#39;s seems much more spectacular.&quot; Peter agreed as he too found himself lost within its gaze. He began to feel strange too. His heart started racing all of a sudden as a strange sensation pushed its way down his body. He though he was just getting aroused, though nothing was made of it. <br />
<br />
The two continued speaking, trying their best to ignore the way they felt. But the more they stared at the moon the stronger the feeling became. Unbeknownst to them, it was caused by the curse of the gypsy. Her words were not the false threat that they believed them to be as Lauren&#39; ears began to twitch. She let out a small moan as they began to grow.  They got longer with each passing second, growing sideways until reached almost six inches in length. She could feel it happening, though she couldn&#39;t comprehend what she was feeling. By the time she raised her hands upwards they had already fully grown and small patches of fur had just begun to appear over them. She grabbed one with her hand; running her hand along it and screwing her face up in confusion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Peter had long since sat up. He could feel a pressure building just above his ass, like he was sitting on something strange. Immediately as he left his chair he felt relief. He looked behind him, searching the chair for a foreign object when he felt it once more, this time pushing its way against the back of his pants. He groaned uncomfortably, thinking whatever it was before had entered his trousers. He could feel whatever it was, working against his tailbone as he quickly undid his belt buckle, sliding them down just and inch before the pressure subsided. <br />
<br />
Holding his pants up with his thighs he reached behind him, trying to grasp whatever was causing him such discomfort. His fingers wrapped tightly around the strange object, causing his eyes to open wide in shock when he felt it. He felt his fingers around the object.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!?&quot; he muttered under his breath. He then grabbed the rope like object and pulled it in front of him. It was furry and long, with a large tasseled end. It seemed alive between his fingers and swayed around wildly. It took him a second to realize exactly what it was. <br />
<br />
Lauren meanwhile was trying to comprehend why her ears were so large and furry. &quot;Uh Peter... What&#39;s this?&quot; She asked, turning her head towards her boyfriend who was now standing, his pants down to his knees as he grasped what appeared to be his own tail in his hands. <br />
<br />
He looked up at Lauren who grasped a pair of furry donkey ears in her hands as they both screamed loudly. They continued yelling, running around in panic for what must have been 10 minutes before they finally calmed down enough to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real...&quot; Peter said, thinking back to the night of the fair. &quot;She actually cursed us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it is real, Peter! Do you remember what she said?! Exactly what she said?!&quot; Lauren replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not really... It was something about a full moon, asses and it affecting us daily... One day at a time? I remember that line. She said to break the curse we needed to apologize.&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well okay, the full moon makes sense, that&#39;s what triggered it...&quot; Lauren deduces, looking upwards. &quot;Ass is slang for a donkey, which explains the ears and tail. As for the daily part I have no idea. I mean, this will clearly affect us on a daily basis, so I don&#39;t get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it means we&#39;ll change a little bit every day. Or at least that&#39;s my guess.&quot; Peter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s it then. Every day we&#39;ll slowly turn into animals!&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what now?&quot; Peter asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we track down that crazy woman and apologize. Hopefully she can reverse this before it&#39;s too late.&quot; Said Lauren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... We don&#39;t even know where she is. She could be halfway across the country by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to find out where they are, just go and get your laptop, I&#39;ll get mine and we can search for the name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what was that again?&quot; Peter said, rubbing the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t remember?! Crap, neither do I. Just be vague and search for traveling fairs. I&#39;m sure something will come up.&quot; <br />
<br />
The pair dash inside and as instructed get straight onto their computers typing madly away at Google. They could only pray that they would be successful in tracking down the gypsy who cursed them and the fair she belonged too. It was difficult not even knowing the name of the place, but they were determined and would stay up all night if they had too.</p>
