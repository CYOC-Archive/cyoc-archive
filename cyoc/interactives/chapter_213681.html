*DUSTY BANGS – TRANSFORMATIVE PORN PRODUCTIONS*.  Frank looked at the business card as the car he was riding in pulled into the garage of an unassuming suburban house.<br />
<br />
Frank had been pandering in his usual spot when an overweight man had walked up, handed him that card and a $100 bill, then asked him if he wanted to make $900 more.<br />
<br />
“You’re gonna come to my house and I’m going to masturbate to you eating a huge plate of food.  All you have to do is eat, no sex or nothing,” Dusty had said.<br />
<br />
The whole thing was weird, but it was cold outside and the shelters were overfilled, not to mention dangerous.  With $1,000, Frank could get a nice motel room for a month or two.  Hell, with a shower and address, he might even be able to get a job.  And besides, the card looked professional and this Dusty guy was driving a nice car and wearing a nice suit – far too nice for this to be some sort of a scam.<br />
<br />
Frank palmed the card as Dusty pulled into the garage.  Stepping out of the car, Dusty walked over to a door and said, “in here, just sit at the table with the cameras.”<br />
<br />
Frank got out of the car and walked into the interior of the house.  Any concern he may have had that he was about to get robbed or raped vanished when he got to the living room.  It was extremely typical – a couch and chairs in front of a big screen TV, then off to the side was a kitchen with a dining nook.  And just like Dusty had said, inside of the nook was a table surrounded with some very professional looking lights and camera equipment.  There was even a large green screen behind one of the chairs, which Frank assumed was where he was supposed to sit.<br />
<br />
Frank walked over to his seat, looking around he could see that he was right in view of all the cameras, which had clearly been set up to catch a 360 degree view of him.<br />
<br />
“So you just want me to sit here and eat?” Frank asked.<br />
<br />
“Ya, let me get you some food.” Dusty said as he walked into the kitchen, returning with a massive plate of scrambled eggs.  <br />
<br />
“There’s a dozen eggs here and I have a few dozen more, if you manage to eat all of them there’s an extra $250 in it for you,” he said as he set the plate and a salt shaker down in front of Frank, before picking up a small remote and clicking a button on it.<br />
<br />
The lights surrounding the table flashed on, briefly startling Frank.  Once Frank regained his composure, he could see small green lights illuminated on most of the cameras – apparently it was go time.<br />
<br />
Frank didn’t need any more encouragement – he was starving, and the eggs smelled amazing.  He sprinkled a bit of salt over them, then picked up a fork and began digging in.<br />
<br />
“You ever worked on a porn before?”  Dusty asked as he sat down on a chair directly across the room from Frank.  The bright lights made it hard to see anything outside of the nook, but Frank could still make out Dusty unbuttoning his jacket and dropping his pants, while a thick cock flopped out below a small mound of pubic hair that continued up his stomach and under his shirt.<br />
<br />
“Nah man, so this is a porno?  You just watch me eat and masturbate?”  Frank mumbled through a mouth half full of egg.<br />
<br />
“Not quite,” Dusty replied.  <br />
<br />
Frank could see Dusty put a towel across his forehead, before draping a small jar over the tip of his cock.<br />
<br />
“See this?” Dusty said as he pointed to a small book that was peaking out from between the couch and his ass, “this is a magic book, it turns people into other things.”<br />
<br />
“Other things?”  Frank asked.<br />
<br />
“Ya, animals and stuff.  I’ve mostly been making steers, hogs, dogs… that kind of thing, but I’ve been looking to branch out,” Dusty continued, “see, the other day this guy called me a bitch.  Well this book can’t do that, can’t change gender, so I asked my friend – he’s got a magic book that can – if I could borrow his.  He said no, you know, but he tore the page with the gender change spell and gave it to me.”<br />
<br />
“And that’s the crazy thing,” Dusty said, “when I put that piece of paper in this book it kind of merged and I got a new spell I wanted to try out, so I was hoping you would help me with that.”<br />
<br />
Frank chuckled a bit.  So this guy was nuts, or maybe this was part of the setup?  Either way Frank didn’t care.  He needed the money and the food was good.  <br />
<br />
“So what, you just like, cast a spell and poof I turn into a frog?”  Frank asked.<br />
<br />
“Something like that, but see, thing is its actually a competition between these books.  I lost, and my bud with the other book.  Well, it takes energy to cast these spells, and his book can change different aspects of your body.  So he did something to me, made it so my energy reserve is too small – I can cast spells but I just pass out.”<br />
<br />
Well, Frank thought, at least this guy had an excuse for why nothing was going to happen.<br />
<br />
Dusty moved about slight in the chair, then began rubbing his slowly engorging member.<br />
<br />
“I found a way around it though, see,” Dusty said as his arm picked up speed, “another thing he did was to make my sweat transformative.  I can’t really do much with it normally, but I figured out how to make a cologne out of it.”<br />
<br />
Dusty began breathing heavily as he kept talking, “all I have to do is jack off with a picture of something in my mind.  I cum into this here,” he said motioning down to the jar, “mix it with a bit of my sweat and now I have a cologne that turns whoever smells it into whatever I had pictured in my mind.”<br />
<br />
“Anything?”  <br />
<br />
“Unngh,” Dusty said as a load of thick, white cum shot out into the jar, “not anything, the book has to have a spell that can do it.”<br />
<br />
Frank’s stomach was beginning to feel full and a quick glance at the plate showed that he’d managed to get down all dozen of the eggs.  Looking back towards Dusty, Frank watched as Dusty picked the towel up off his head and wrung it out into the jar, filling it with sweat.  Dusty screwed a small sprayer onto the top of it before giving it a good shake, resulting in a cloudy mixture of cum and musk.<br />
<br />
Frank watched as Dusty got up and began walking towards the table.  <br />
<br />
“I finished the plate, you said you had more eggs?”<br />
<br />
Dusty just smiled as he lifted the cologne bottle.</p>
