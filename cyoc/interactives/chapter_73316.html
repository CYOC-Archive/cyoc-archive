<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought about his options and didn’t know what to do.  If he goes for a random inanimate change, then there’s no telling what he’s going to be and how long this will last.  It is a risky move even he is afraid of.  But he had to see if this Chronivac would work or not.  Taking a quick breather, he said to himself in an uncomfortable tone, “Oh well…  Might as well get this over with.  Maybe this program is a big enough joke.”  So he clicked on the ‘yes’ icon and waited for something to happen.  As he was waiting, he vision got a little blurry and the world around him darkening.  Jeff panicked and didn’t know what to do.  But just as he was going to scream, his vision returned.  But what he saw was truly surprising.<br />
<br />
Instead of the safety of his room, he was outside of some kind of field with no people around.  All he could see is miles of grass and a bunch of trees around him.  Jeff finds this completely odd and didn’t realize the program he got could transport him to someplace devoid of human life.  But looking down, he realized something else was a miss.  What he saw was that he had no clothes on him what so ever.  He was naked!  He quickly covered himself up and was a little embarrassed.  Though he didn’t see anyone around, he knew it was a little unexpected for him.  He tried to walk away and find some place to stay until he could figure out what’s going on.  But as he was going to leave, he found out that he couldn’t move.  Almost like his feet was stuck to the ground.  Looking down, he wondered why he wouldn’t budge.  But as he was looking at his feet, he soon realize why.<br />
<br />
For as he was starring, each of his toes were growing as his toenails fell off.  They continue to extend while the ends grew pointy.  All around his feet, more nubs popped out of the sides and grew along with his toes.  At the same time, his skin grew darker and hardens as indents appeared on the surface.  Looking down, Jeff could tell that his toes were turning into roots as they dig deep into the ground, absorbing all the nutrients from the soil.  Putting all of this together, he soon realized what was becoming of him.  The Chronivac didn’t just transport him, it’s changing him.  And being that he chooses a random change into an inanimate object, he knew exactly what he’s changing into.  A tree!<br />
<br />
He starred down in amazement as he saw the changes spread up to his legs.  The bark like skin spread up to his knees and stopped at his hips.  He could feel his bones stiffen as his muscles harden.  Then another change occurred.  For as his legs finished changing, he slowly drew closer together, fusing into one big tree stem.  Then he started to grow, slowly but surely, getting past his height of 5’5.  He looked on and could tell that he was growing bigger and bigger, trying to match the same size as the trees around him.<br />
<br />
As the changes spread, he could feel his groin stirring.  Looking down again, he could see his penis erecting and growing longer.  He believes that he was having a boner and wanted to release himself.  But just as he was about to do his thing, he noticed something else he didn’t expect.  For he saw his dick growing longer and longer as his mushroom head flatten and slit sealed off.  The shaft then grew darker and turned into the same wood substance as the rest of him.  It then grew many twigs and extended longer, as leaves multiplied.  Jeff sighed, as he knew that he wouldn’t masturbate again.  He just hopes that this won’t last a long time.<br />
<br />
He kept on growing as the bark spread up to his chest.  He could feel his body rounding, his stomach bloating, and his insides hardening.  His chest grew flat and rounded out, turning into the tree’s trunk in the middle.  He stopped breathing and couldn’t hear his own heart beat as his hearts and lungs stopped functioning.  Yet he’s still alive in all of this and was enjoying this type of change.<br />
<br />
Jeff then felt his arms moving on their own as they spread out like an airplane.  They too started to grow and extended further away from him.  The bark color then spread to his arms to the tips of his fingers.  His fingers grew along with the rest of him as they split in many ways and shaped in any angle.  More leaves continued to grow within the sticks and making it concealed his face.  At the same time, more sticks and stems grew all over his previous body and making him feel more concealed then before.  In short, this change is making him feel more like a tree then ever.<br />
<br />
All that’s left of him was the head, but that would soon change.  His head started to expand while his neck grew wide in length.  Soon enough, his head matched the same size as the tree.  His hair was next to go as it started to grow out and harden into the same stems as his arms and dick.  It grew incredibly huge and leaves spread so fast.  They blocked so much of the sunlight that it was giving him a lot of shade.  Now all that was left was his face as that too changes.  His ears absorbed into the bark and disappeared, making him hearless.  He could feel his nose getting smaller until he got sealed itself up, making it impossible to breath.  His eyes grew incredibly tired until they were sealed off completely, making it impossible to see.  The only thing that’s left is his mouth.  It started to grow big and round while the inside of the mouth start to hollow out.  Each of his teeth then disappeared and his mouth now looked like a huge hole for a fury critter to come into.  Finally, his brain started to get fuzzy until he can’t remember anything.  The only thing he knows is that he’s a tree and he needs to grow and stay healthy.  In a matter of minutes, all Jeff was is a lifeless tree that only cares about being one.<br />
<br />
In Jeff’s room, the computer chimed and a message appeared on it.  It states: ‘Transformation complete.  Time to return to normal will be exactly one year.  Have a nice day.’  Jeff was completely oblivious about this as he was just a tree at a random location.  Now he had to wait an entire year until he can return to normal.  During his wait…</p>
