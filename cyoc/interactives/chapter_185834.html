<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Daniel did his rounds and noted the thing he found. Other than that, nothing really. The academy is in a good condition, thanks to us, and we did not pass by the staircase. Also, what is it with you and that staircase?&quot; Jon said. &quot;You&#39;re way too fidgety around that place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That place is dangerous and I&#39;m just concerned about you. Anyways, I have to go. I only passed by to give you these. So, take care kid.&quot; Uncle Jim tipped his bowling hat and went on his way. As his pickup track disappeared from the gravel road, Jon giddily went back to the mirror and transformed into Matt. <br />
<br />
With his uncle gone, Jon could finally do the first step of his plan. He went to the decrepit locker rooms of the academy and looked for neat are taking pictures. He found his place in the seat behind lockers that were spared from the rust. With his phone, he snapped selfies and various angles. He uploaded them in a new profile on a famous social media site and awaited the prey to fall on his lap. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, Jon got multiple friend requests when he checked his phone during his lunch break. The social media he posted in is like a dating site where friends are requested to you based on how they are from you. It was simply a social media site at the beginning where neighbors could meet neighbors. But like everything on the Internet, a few individuals joining ruined the entire thing. It devolved far from its original goal and turned into a site where people can find one-night stands.<br />
<br />
Jon thought for a while. Is what he&#39;s doing evil? There is no question that it is. He did bad things in the past and he&#39;d be a fool to think that he would stop now just because he found an honest job. But what he&#39;s doing is giving the world a favor despite its negative connotations. Jon scrolled among the requests, especially those that did not even hide their intentions of having sex. What he saw surprised him. Television claimed that predators often look like old men with thick yellowish glasses. But these people on the list look like your ordinary folk. Seeing them made Jon more convicted of his actions. And he started his choice with a person society would not miss. A single guy in his 40s who works at the local factory. This guy named Jacob said his greetings and his intentions to talk. Jon accepted and from there, they hit it off. <br />
<br />
The two were amicable at the start. They talked about their interests and their jobs, and of course, Jon lied that he is still a student living in Terra Falls. Then the conversation immediately turned lewd when Jacob sent a picture of his engorged member. Jon was goaded in sending him but he did not. Instead, he goaded Jacob that it would be better as a surprise. They could meet sometime today, likely in a local place where Jon always hangs out. And by that, he meant the academy. Jacob said yes without hesitation. The only thing left to do is wait until the dark. And when the moon appeared from the horizon, Jon heard gravel turning where a car stopped by the cabin. <br />
<br />
Jacob came out from the car door, and like the others, he looked like the usual guy that you would pass in the street. He has black hair with waxing signs of it receding. He towered over Jon both by height and width. His biceps are as big as Jon&#39;s head, and he could crush him with his strength alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you Jon?&quot; Jacob asked while looking behind his shoulders. Likely because he thinks this is a sting operation and cameras from live television shows would burst out of the treeline. But so far, his thoughts are just thoughts, and two of them are alone in this decrepit place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jon nodded with a youthful smile that hid his throbbing heart. This whole plan of his could turn sour in case Jacob used that strength of his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that the place?&quot; Jacob pointed at the cabin, asking if that&#39;s the place where they&#39;ll do their routines.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that is just my uncle&#39;s cabin. The place I&#39;m talking about is a small walk away but I swear you&#39;ll love the place. Follow me,&quot;<br />
<br />
The two walked inside the school where Jon kept the lights open to lessen the creepy factor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Jacob said amazed. &quot;I never thought that there would be a school in this town.&quot;<br />
<br />
From that, Jon knew that Jacob is likely a newcomer to the town. &quot;It&#39;s abandoned in the 80s and my uncle is in charge of cleaning the place. But he&#39;s gone and that leaves us alone for the rest of the night.&quot; Jon winked.<br />
<br />
They walked across abandoned hallways and passed empty hall rooms, as Jon lead the other to the center of the academy. There, he opened the room to the dark staircase where the scenery inside surprised them both. Instead of the slow descent to darkness, the room transformed into a large bedroom with a California King-sized bed is placed on the opposite wall of the room. The room is complete with amenities like cabinets, a television set, and a door that likely leads to a bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe that your uncle built a bedroom in this school,&quot; Jacob said.<br />
<br />
Jon chuckled, &quot;Same thoughts, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob was the first to walk inside, but as he did, the door slammed close. Jon swore that the sound is heard around the campus. There was silence at first, then came the knocks. Jacob asked for the door to open as if Jon would want to. The requests became cries for help as he pounded on the thick wooden door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck! What the fuck is that!?&quot; Jacob cried. <br />
<br />
Jon could not see what is happening inside, but he has this innate understanding of the unfolding events. The creature from the dark grabbed Jacob by the foot. Its fingers are as cold as the freezing winter, closing on Jacob&#39;s feet and dragged him deeper into the dark. The very touch was vile, like corruption to the soul. Tried as he might, Jacob could not break free even with his overwhelming strength. Of course, his muscles would not work because the creature is taking hold of his soul, not his body. Tendrils pulled out Jacob from his body and ghastly fangs ripped his soul to shreds. <br />
<br />
There were screams of pain - just a second but felt like an eternity to Jacob. The heavy poundings stopped and soon, the door opened to reveal its original contents - a bunch of huddled faces floating in the dark abyss. But this time, the faces were smiling from the satisfying meal. <br />
<br />
Jacob came out from the darkness. His eyes are dead but his lethargic actions meant that he is still alive in there, somewhere. The older man took one look at Jon, who is now back in his original appearance, nodded then went on his way out of the academy. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was vile,&quot; the creature hissed, &quot;but a meal nonetheless. And by that, thank you. I expect to see more,&quot;<br />
<br />
Jon returned to his cabin, tired yet fulfilled at the same time. It&#39;s strange but it feels like he shared meals with that creature. What did he do next?</p>
