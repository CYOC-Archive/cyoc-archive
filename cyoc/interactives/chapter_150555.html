<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took Freed and Mai a few more days after parting with Jack and Dolph to reach his home village of Ironbark, but finally the outer most buildings could be seen in the distance as they created the hill.<br />
<br />
&quot;See that windmill over there? That&#39;s the start of my village,&quot; Freed eagerly pointed to the cylindrical tower with a slowly turning pinwheel.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is it turning? There&#39;s no wind,&quot; Mai looked around at the still grass and treetops.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably just Old Riley turning it. He&#39;s the old wizard that owns the mill, uses it like a mage tower,&quot; he further explained when he saw Mai&#39;s inquisitive expression. &quot;He mills the grain we bring him, even on windless days, and in return we supply him with ingredients for his potions instead of pay. We&#39;ll see him later, right now I think a rest will be the better choice.&quot; Freed rolled his shoulders to ease the ache from his bag straps that were digging into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The village can&#39;t be too much farther away,&quot; Mai looked down the road. &quot;Do you want to continue to the village?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A soft chair would be a better alternative to the hard ground,&quot; he relented, &quot;yes, we will press on.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The pair walked farther into the village, and the trees drastically grew in size around them. Mai&#39;s head was turning in every direction in an effort to see everything around her. The spaces between the gigantic trees were occupied by human structures of varying sizes, but it was the trees themselves that attracted Mai&#39;s attention most. Each tree was wider than a castle tower and some were much taller. Doorways we&#39;re carved into the bases of the great trees and the inside made into home&#39;s, a few windows were scattered in the bark.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing,&quot; Mai gasped at the blending of tree dwellings and traditional structures.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I suppose it is. I&#39;m just used to it, I suppose,&quot; Freed said absently, his mind more focused on the people around him. As they passed the residents, many waved to him and shouted greetings and Freed returned them happily, but he also caught the lingering stares. &#39;Amazing what a change in hair color and some ink does to change people&#39;s perceptions,&#39; he pondered. &quot;Here we are,&quot; Freed led Mai to a wide 2 story structure that sat at a large clearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your parents home,&quot; Mai asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, this is where we can rest for a while and get something to eat before we meet my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t they want us to join them for a meal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For tonight yes, but I really need to rest before I meet them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you not excited to see them again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but they can be a little... overactive. Especially my brother and sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they bully you for being so small?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are,&quot; Mai teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m n-! Anyways, when we meet them you&#39;ll see i take more after my mother than my father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh is she short too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Freed ignored her and pushed into the inn. They found an empty table and seated themselves, Mai&#39;s chair creaking softly under her, and ordered their meal. Once inside and seated they ate their meal in relative peace, besides the occasional greeting from another village resident welcoming Freed back. <br />
<br />
It was when they were nearly finished with their meal that the door to the inn was thrown open with a crash, followed by an almost shrill voice, &quot;Freed Macdouglas Gornhilde!&quot; Freed tensed up and pulled himself inward. A very angry red haired elven woman strode into the inn, determination blazing in her eyes. As she stalked in, the other patrons rapidly got out of her way and bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hi ma,&quot; Freed said, waving nervously.<br />
&quot;How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I? How am I? Was there somethin&#39; yew left out of yewer letter to us,&quot; she yelled in a thick accent, hands on her hips. &quot;Ah start hearin&#39; you&#39;ve gone an&#39; changed your &#39;air an got tatted up while you&#39;re away from &#39;ome. So yew tell me, how I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
Freed began to explain what the tattoos were for, when the inn door was slammed open again, this time with the sound of wood breaking. &quot;Careful! My door is older than you two,&quot; the innkeeper scolded the 2 figures and they entered. Standing over six feet tall and strongly built, the two red haired half-elves grinned. Their clothes and leather aprons were patched in some places and small wood chips still clung to them, it was obvious they had been doing some kind of woodwork before they came.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry &#39;ank. We &#39;eard our baby brother was &#39;ome an&#39; wanted to see &#39;im,&quot; explained the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;An&#39; there he is! An&#39; he even found mother before us,&quot; the brother said quickly and pulled his sister along and away from the annoyed innkeeper. Behind them the door slowly creaked shut, a few cracks showing near the edges.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Brishen, Alvina,&quot; Freed said waved with one hand while he held his head in the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lookit our wee brother all grown oop an&#39; &#39;e&#39;s even got &#39;imself a girl too,&quot; the male, Brishen threw his arm around Freed&#39;s neck and pulled him into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, actually I&#39;m not,&quot; Mai began before the sister, Alvina came up to her and hugged her tightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;My yew&#39;re a tall one,&quot; Alvina looked up into Mai&#39;s eyes. &quot;Wot race are yew anywho? Never seen such a set of wings before besides-.&quot; The sound of heavy footsteps outside the door stopped her mid sentence. &quot;Ah think that&#39;s Father now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door was thrown open and shattered into splinters as the massive figure squeezed through the doorway. Standing slightly shorter than Freed&#39;s two siblings, but easily out matching them in sheer muscle, stood what Mai guessed was Freed&#39;s father. Covered in thick furs and wearing a broadaxe on his hip, his face was mostly obscured by his thick greying beard and hair. The innkeeper began to protest the destruction of his door but was stopped with a single glance from the man. When he spoke it was with a steel like authority.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the boy at,&quot; he scanned slowly around the room until his eyes fell upon Freed. Brishen nearly dove out of the way as the giant ran towards Freed and lifted him high into the air like a father would a newborn. &quot;Ah Ha! Ma&#39; lad is &#39;ome! Lookit &#39;ow yew&#39;ve grown! Ha Ha, well ah suppose yew could still grow a wee bit more!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Da, I&#39;ve missed you too,&quot; Freed smiled while he tried to wiggle free of the large hands holding him up. &quot;Could you put me down? I think mother is giving me the state.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this the giant glanced at his elven wife and his joy faded before her piercing stare. Her arms were folded across her chest and her foot had an inpatient tapping rhythm. He carefully put Freed down and looked at his wife inquisitively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, no. Nothin&#39;s wrong,&quot; her voice thick with sarcasm, &quot;save our son &#39;as come back &#39;ome an&#39; has changed his whole look!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So? &#39;Am sure he &#39;as a good reason to look this way. Actually the &#39;air looks good on yew,&quot; he whispered sidelong to Freed.<br />
<br />
&quot;An&#39; I very much wood like to know &#39;is &#39;good reason&#39; fer bein&#39; covered &#39;ead to toe in tattoos as well. But yes the &#39;air does look good if ye actually brushed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain, but tonight when not so many people are staring,&quot; Freed nervously glanced around the room at the crowd of onlookers. &quot;For now let&#39;s just call it my punishment for my arrogance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her features seemed to soften slightly at this as a way of acceptance of his terms. &quot;Very well. We shall see yew tonight at dinner. An&#39; bring your lady friend along as well,&quot; she flashed Mai a quick smile before turning to leave. &quot;Come along Mason. Yew too Brishen and Alvina.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes love. See yew two tonight,&quot; Freed&#39;s father, Mason waved and left out the destroyed door frame with the twins in tow offering to replace to the door later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...that went well,&quot; Freed sighed and slumped back into his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was it going well? Your mother sounded furious,&quot; Mai countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may seem like that, but it&#39;s more her way of showing concern. She has to be stern to keep both my siblings and father in check from running amok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have a question for you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does your whole family have an accent but you have none?&quot;<br />
<br />
Freed laughed at this. &quot;Noticed tha&#39; did yew? Well, it&#39;s rather &#39;ard to cast a spell wen yew say tha incantation like this,&quot; his speech pattern suddenly shifted to sound just like his family. &quot;I have to actively surpress my accent to cast spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens when you don&#39;t surpress it and try magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me put it like this; I was dead last in exams in my first year before it was suggested I try to loose the accent.&quot; He finished his meal and stood up. &quot;Shall ah show yew &#39;round ma &#39;ome,&quot; Freed grinned.</p>
