<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eight months after the fury flu up ended the world. Brittany slowly struggled to get up off of the couch; she was roughly eight months pregnant and couldn’t tell if she needed to pee or was having one of her wild pregnancy cravings. Finding out that pickles slathered with peanut butter, or caramel ice cream with black olives were some of the best things she could shovel into her wolfish maw. The anthro grey wolf fury grumbled as her bladder won the battle and she slowly waddled to bathroom.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait until this is over,” Brittany sighing as she sat on the toilet and felt relief as her body let loose a torrent of urine. After wiping and flushing once done, she slowly walks out of the bathroom; naturally cradling her massively pregnant belly. She has yet to tell her mate that it’s not one cub she is carrying but two.<br />
“Jake is sure going to be shocked with twins,” Brittany feeling their squirming within her as she makes it back towards the couch. She gets halfway when the doorbell rings and she grumbles.<br />
“This better be a surprise pizza that Jake ordered for me while he&#39;s at work,” Brittany speaking loudly as she opens the door.<br />
<br />
“No pizza,” Allison looking at her grumpy B.F.F; “but I do have shawarma!” Brittany seeing Allison at the door with a bag of food; she smirks a little as she too is now looking like a preggo fury.<br />
“Are you carrying twins,” Brittany letting her friend in as she slowly heads towards the dining room table. The condo while looking small did have three bedrooms and two baths. The kitchen and living room was one large space.<br />
“Twin orders of chicken shawarma,” Allison putting the food on the table; the anthro cougar fury looking at her friend and smiling as she let slip a secret. “But you weren’t asking that were you,” Allison placing a hand paw on her friend’s fury belly and feeling the kicks. “Oooh they are feisty.”<br />
“And you can’t tell anyone,” Brittany sitting down and diving into the shaved chicken with rice, lentils and various sauces; “not even your mate Jimmy.”<br />
“Only if you tell me the gender,” Allison grinning; “because you must have been told when your OBGYN dropped the twin bomb.”<br />
<br />
“A boy and a girl,” Brittany responding; “as for which is a wolf and which is a deer fury, the doctor would not say. She wanted that to be a surprise.”<br />
“A son for me,” Allison telling Brittany the gender of her bun in the oven; tucking into her shawarma and pulling out some baklava for dessert.<br />
“Deer or cougar fury,” Brittany looking at her friend; noting how swollen her breasts have gotten.<br />
“Cougar,” Allison adding some extra tahini sauce to her shawarma; “Jimmy knows but we want it to be a surprise for everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Are you planning a baby shower,” Brittany looking at her friend; while everyone wanted to throw her one Brittany refused to reveal many details about her pregnancy. Finding out she was carrying twins the day before the party was stressful enough as it was.<br />
“Like yours it will be small, just immediate family and select friends.” Allison pausing as she feels her fetus make a small kick; she was only six months along compared to Brittany’s eight months.<br />
<br />
They chatted idly over various issues; ranging from personal interests, potential names for their growing cubs to interesting things they saw on television while on pregnancy duty. Brittany was on maternity leave from her job at the local high school while Allison had to take a sabbatical from her college courses.<br />
“I watched on the news that North Korea reunified with the South,” Brittany referring to a new news station that replaced a major station; now called the Fury News Network or FNN for short. They started broadcasting near the end of December; first reporting on the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine and how furies managed to construct the concrete sarcophagus that now entombs the damaged Soviet era reactor.<br />
“I saw that too,” Allison nodding; “it was full of pomp and ceremony. The new dictator of North Korea handing over a ceremonial sabre to the president of South Korea and then everyone uses their runes to remove the physical barrier separating the two nations.”<br />
“I heard they compared it to the moment when the Berlin wall fell,” Brittany slowly getting up to grab a few sodas.<br />
“Stay sitting Brittany,” Allison seeing her friend struggle; “let me get what it is you were getting up for.”<br />
“Thank you,” Brittany sitting back down; “walking around with an extra twenty pounds is not as easy as it seems. Sodas should be in the fridge.”<br />
<br />
“Got it,” Allison grabbing a couple cans and returning to the table; “Any word as to what happen to the old dictator?” Allison was referring to North Korea’s previous ruler who tried to nuke his country in a vain attempt to stop his country from going fury.<br />
“No idea,” Brittany opening up a can of soda and taking a drink; followed by a belch which caused her swollen breasts to squirt milk. “Some rumors say he was killed; other say he fled to China. But China is not exactly very stable right now.”<br />
“The civil war raging over there,” Allison nodding as she waves a hand paw and turns on the t.v.<br />
“Clever,” Brittany nodding at manipulating the smart t.v without the remote.<br />
“Being pregnant and alone at home while your mate is working,” Allison absently twitching her fingers as she flicks through the channels; “you get bored and begin to experiment as to what you can and can’t do with magic.”<br />
“What else did you discover,” Brittany seeing Allison leaving it on one of the many afternoon soaps that retooled with their actors now fury.<br />
“This, Allison smiling as she stood up; concentrating her runes glowed and her fur began to change color. Adding a few geometric designs before they disappeared and placing a black feline paw mark on her left arm. “I notice several other furies giving themselves some fancy designs on their fur while watching t.v and started experimenting. Even Jimmy is sporting a few.”<br />
“Fury tattoos,” Brittany laughing; “now that’s nifty. Ooooh,” Brittany clutching her belly; “that was a big kick.”<br />
“You need help getting up,” Allison approaching her friend still sitting at the table; seeing her pant and struggling to rise after eating lunch.<br />
“Please,” Brittany gasping before doubling over in pain as she winces; “oh fuck! That wasn’t a kick!”<br />
<br />
“I think your water just broke,” Allison seeing the fur on her friend’s thighs getting wet. “You need to lie down, while I call for an ambulance.”<br />
“I don’t think they’ll make it,” Brittany wincing as she feels another sharp pain rip through her body; giving her a compulsive urge to bear down and push. “Oh they’re coming! Call Jake now!”<br />
“On it,” Allison summoning her phone and dialing the Proudhoof restaurant’s number. “Sasha, it’s Allison. I’m with Brittany, she just went into labour. Tell Jake it’s time!” Allison hangs up before the anthro Cheetah fury could get in a word and she furiously starts texting Allison’s parents as well as her mate and Michael.<br />
“Oh fuck I can see the head,” Allison putting her phone down as she struggles to get on the floor to help. Being pregnant herself, Allison’s mobility was getting limited so she had to use a nearby chair as a means to support her rapid decent.<br />
“Oh it hurts,” Brittany screaming as Allison’s phone starts going mad with responses to her emergency messages.<br />
“Just one more,” Allison helping to guide the head through; hearing Brittany howl as she makes the push, she gasps in relief as she feels the cub sliding out of her and begins crying.<br />
“You have a son,” Allison holding the tiny wolf cub fury in her arms. Her celebration was soon put on hold when Brittany screamed as she felt another contraction.<br />
“Here comes the second one,” She winces; “Oh were the fuck is Jake!”<br />
<br />
“Hopefully he will be here,” Allison responding; “just keep pushing with each contraction.” Allison grabs here phone to see the madness she unleashed as just about everyone said they would be on their way. She quickly added that they better get her soon as Brittany was about to deliver her second cub.<br />
“Sorry,” Allison realizing her mistake; “I just spoiled the surprise you were hoping to spring on Jake.”<br />
<br />
“Arrrrrrg,” Brittany screaming as she bears down; feeling the head of her second cub crowning. The sound of the door slamming open and a thunderous torrent of hooves signaling that Jake has arrived just in time to see his mate give birth to their daughter; followed by Michael and Denise Proudhoof.<br />
“Oh thank goodness,” Allison sighing as the doe cub slides out of Brittany’s distended vagina; her cries along with her brother’s as she hands the two to Brittany who is now crying as her painful ordeal was quickly over.<br />
“Twins,” Jake looking stunned; as he sees both a boy and a girl wailing in their mother’s arms.<br />
“Surprise,” Brittany speaking weakly.<br />
“That explains why she was so big,” Denise getting down to help severe the umbilical cords. “Fetch a towel to help clean them up.”<br />
“You do that Jake,” Allison getting up to sit in the nearby chair; “i’m beat and I’m not looking forward to my time in a few months.”<br />
“If you want,” Brittany feeling exhausted from her ordeal; “I can stick with you and help deliver your cub.”<br />
“Deal,” Allison chomping on a bit of baklava while Jake returns with a few towels to help clean his cubs up with.<br />
“You should have told me we were having twins,” Jake taking his daughter; a baby doe fury as he swaddles her after cleaning her up. “This is going to change the nursery up some.”<br />
“Nothing a little paint can’t fix,” Michael looking proud now that he is a grandfather.<br />
<br />
A half hour later as an ambulance arrive to take Brittany and her newborn cubs to the hospital with Jake following behind; Brittany’s parents Lucas and Rachael Soulfang arrive only to get a quick glimpse at their daughter and grandcubs before they are carted off to the hospital.<br />
“Before you ask,” Allison speaking up; “Brittany is fine. She delivered twins. A boy and a girl, no I do not know what they intend to name them.”<br />
“Nor I,” Michael answering; “but let’s give them a few hours before we mob them at the hospital.”<br />
“You can wait,” Lucas looking at the anthro stag-deer; “but I want to see my grand cubs.”<br />
“We need to get balloons,” Rachael pawing her mate; “and cake.”<br />
“You guys go,” Allison waving them off; “I’ll help clean up here and meet you their.”<br />
“Nonsense,” Michael responding; “you come with us Allison. If it wasn’t for you, Brittany would have been all alone with her labor.”<br />
“What made you come over today,” Denise looking at the pregnant fury; “if you don’t mind me asking.”<br />
“I was bored,” Allison answering as she watches Michael lock up; “Jimmy at work and having to rest at home instead of at college. I figured Brittany was also going stir crazy with loneliness as well.”<br />
“Then maybe I’ll have Jimmy take a break from the bar until you give birth,” Michael escorting his other daughter in law with Denise close behind; “he doesn’t need to be at the restaurant to balance the books and work the schedules.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
They all gather at the maternity ward to see Brittany passed out and Jake placing his son in the hospital crib. His daughter already n her crib and sleeping. Both already have a fresh diaper on them as the nurses cart them away.<br />
“Dusk and Dawn,” Jake taking a seat in the nearby chair as he watches his mate sleep. “that is what we are naming the cubs,” Jake not looking up despite knowing his father and inlaws are there. His son, a wolf cub fury named Dusk. And his daughter; a doe cub fury named Dawn. While Dawn had white spots on her fur; indicative of a newborn fawn. These spots that will eventually fade as she gets older.  Dusk’s fur was a charcoal grey with subtle reddish highlights. “I should have been there when Brittany went into labor,” Jake looking up and noticing Allison there as well. “Thank you,” Jake tearing up; “I don’t know what would happen if you weren’t there,” Acknowledging the female cougar fury.<br />
“Let it go Jake,” Brittany mumbling as she was still half awake; “none of us knew I would go into labor today.”<br />
“She’s not wrong,” Denise speaking up; “but they look healthy and that is what is important.”<br />
“In other words, cheer up,” Michael looking at his son; “you are father and your whole world is about to change. And I’m speaking from experience.”</p>
