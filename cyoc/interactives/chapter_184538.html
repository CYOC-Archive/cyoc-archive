<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As part of getting ready to take part in some kind of surveillance or other operation against the corrupt cabal at the NSA, Merritt was working out more than ever.  He&#39;d already been a star runner in college and still in very good condition 3 years after college.  <br />
<br />
But, using the Chronivac, Merritt had fine tuned his six foot one, 165 pound physique even further.  Now, he could run a 45 second 400 meters, for example, just a second and change off a world record pace.  <br />
<br />
He lifted weights some and ran sprints around the apartment complex.  He knew that residents and people walking or driving by were gawking at him.  It wasn&#39;t the reason he ran but the truth was he liked the attention.  He liked showing off what he could do and showing off his body.<br />
<br />
That afternoon he&#39;d finished his run and jogged to the door of his building getting there at the same time as a very heavy, dark haired woman with whom he used to exchange more pleasantries than with most of the other residents.  She was vivacious and friendly but weighed down in every sense by what slender Merritt guessed was 250 pounds, maybe 300.  <br />
He smiled at her at the door.  <br />
She sighed.  &quot;I&#39;d give almost anything to know what it feels like to be able to run like that,&quot; she said softly before adding.  &quot;But we never really know what anyone else&#39;s life is like.&quot; <br />
&quot;I suppose not, Suzanne.  Take care.&quot;<br />
&quot;You too, Merritt.&quot;<br />
<br />
He thought of her again a short while later.  After showering and drying off he had turned on the TV and was surfing through the channels trying to find something worth watching.   Merritt didn&#39;t watch that much TV.  There were so many shows he&#39;d never seen.  One show title that he saw he thought he must have gotten wrong.  He surfed back. <br />
<br />
No, that really was the title.  My 600 pound life.  Merritt shook his head.  But then he thought about what Suzanne had said.  Hmm.  He mulled it over.  Alright, he said to himself.  This is for you, Suzanne.<br />
<br />
So, Merrit through the towel to the side and started up the Chronivac.  He brought the full length mirror out and set it in front of himself.  He admired the sight of his lithe, six foot one frame&#39;s reflection.  It was actually one of the easier things to do with the Chronivac.  He just had to change the weight of the destination identity and also check the box acknowledging that this single change to his profile would negate many other aspects of his profile.<br />
<br />
He smiled.  &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to run a 45 second 400 meters.&quot;  He set the time for the change to a full 5 minutes and pressed START.  At the usual prompt, ARE YOU SURE?  he pressed it again.<br />
<br />
He felt an electromagnetic wave pass through him and instantly he was overwhelmed by tremendous hunger pangs.  Merritt grabbed a bag of trail mix off the counter and shoveled it down as fast as he could. <br />
<br />
He saw, in the mirror, his cheeks puff out.  He looked down and saw his perfect 8 pack abs become less distinct.  But these changes were minor.  He almost lost his balance leaning backward and quickly felt behind him with both hands.  His spectacular round buns were getting deeper and deeper, wider and wider.  Just 30 seconds in Merrit had become pear shaped with extra wide hips and a massive ass.  <br />
<br />
But the changes kept steadily coming and formerly slender Merritt got wider and wider thick rolls of fat covered his arms and chin.  His feet became almost elephantine.  His chest first ballooned out then sagged into not just moobs but a giant pair of jugs that would fill DD cups.  Then his gut ballooned outward, first several inches and then several more and then several more.  Even with the help of the mirror, Merritt couldn&#39;t see his penis as his pachydermic belly sagged down blocking  it from view.  He gained thick rolls of fat on his sides and his back too.  His midsection got bigger and bigger till, even with his enormous ass, now the size of two extra large beach balls,   He was no longer pear shaped.  He was nearly a sphere.<br />
<br />
And, he glanced over at the Chronivac on the desk and saw that it was keeping a running tally of his new weight.<br />
495<br />
496<br />
497<br />
498<br />
499<br />
500<br />
<br />
It was done.  Merritt looked in the mirror at the grotesque caricature he&#39;d turned himself into. <br />
&quot;God, I&#39;m ugly,&quot; he muttered.  But, as much as he hated his new appearance, he hated the way he felt.  Weighed down.  <br />
<br />
He felt like he was trying to carry a whole fitness center worth of weights with him.  He could barely keep his balance. <br />
<br />
With one fat hand on the counter he shuffled hesitantly toward the kitchen again.  Merritt&#39;s new 500 pound body wanted more food and it wanted it now.  But the space on the side of the kitchen island toward which he&#39;d shuffled was only just over 3 feet wide and as Merritt started to try to pass through the gap he was getting stuck.  He reproached himself for not realizing it right away.  It seemed so obvious now but 165 pound Merritt had never developed some skills that 500 pound Merritt needed.<br />
<br />
But, he thought he found a solution.  He shuffled to turn 90 degrees only when he tried to proceed that way, he found that his massive gut in front of him and his enormous ass back of him were even less able to fit in a space only just a little over 3 feet wide.<br />
&quot;Dammit!&quot; he snapped.<br />
He&#39;d turned himself into a 500 pound version of himself that wanted to shovel food down his throat like he&#39;d never eaten in his life.  Only he was now so fat that he couldn&#39;t squeeze his super fat fatty self into the space around the kitchen so that he could get to the food.<br />
&quot;Ugh.  Should have done a little planning here,&quot; he grunted.  <br />
<br />
He shuffled  hesitantly away from the kitchen and found himself in front of the mirror again.  It reflected the massive expanse of his ass.<br />
&quot;God.&quot;<br />
He thought of being at Walmart the week before.  There was a black woman in front of him in line to check out.  She had positively the biggest ass he&#39;d ever seen.  And she was buying more crappy food to swell it even bigger.  He glanced at the reflection of his gargantuan ass again.  If he went on a diet or months, he might be able to shrink his enormous ass to the size of hers.  <br />
<br />
He reached with one arm, rolls of fit jiggling on it in the process, to the fleshy beach ball of a buttock reflected in the mirror.  But letting go of the counter and leaning slightly back to feel the absurd caricature his buns had become upset his balance.  Merritt started falling backward and once his 500 pound body started in motion, he couldn&#39;t stop himself.  <br />
&quot;Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoooooooa!&quot;<br />
His arms with all their rolls of fat pinwheeled to no effect.  He tried to steady himself with his legs but barely slowed his fall.<br />
He fell backward onto a chair.  It creaked for a second under his tremendous mass and the -SNAP-, -SNAP- two of the legs let go.  he fell several inches lower and then to the carpet below, onto his foot and a half deep ass resulting in him bouncing, like a normal man on one of those mini trampolines into the air but then coming down again, hard, body slammed by his own 500 pound body on the carpet.<br />
&quot;Unnnhh.&quot;<br />
Merritt groaned.  He tried to roll over onto his side and get up but the effort took him 10 minutes.  It took him several minutes more to get to his knees and one of the greatest efforts of his life to stand up again.  He decided that he&#39;d had enough of these 335 extra pounds and shuffled toward the Chronivac.  He&#39;d end this transformation now rather than endure another, he glanced at the clock, 4 hours and 40 minutes of this.  The point&#39;s been made.  It sucks to be enormously fat and this isn&#39;t even including other people looking at me with disgust.<br />
<br />
Merritt approached the edge of the desk but realized, to his horror, that his huge gut projected so far in front of him that when he faced the desk, his gut was pressed against it but his arms couldn&#39;t reach the Chronivac several inches back from the edge of it.  He pushed forward angrily.  <br />
&quot;Enough of this, dammit!  I&#39;m not supposed to be a super fatty.&quot;<br />
But he was, at least for the next four hours and change.  No matter what angry, stunningly obese Merritt tried to do, he could not reach the Chronivac.  He knew he could never reach back over his beach ball buns and work the keyboard, never mind the difficulty of typing sort of backwards.  He tried to reach over his side but somehow the rolls of fat on his arms lined up with the rolls of fat cascading down his side and he couldn&#39;t reach the damn thing that way either.  <br />
<br />
For an hour and a half a grunting, angry Merritt tried to overcome his own body without the slightest bit of success.  Multiple times he ended up tumbling backward, squashing end tables and lamps under his enormous ass.  He was huge and awkward and immobile, everything slender trackstar and sometimes ballet dancer Merritt had never been and he hated it.  <br />
<br />
But, eventually he surrendered.  He was seated on the carpet, the remains of the couch against the lower rolls of fat on his back, a hardcover book that had tumbled out of a bookcase during one of his falls wedged all the way up the canyon of a gap between the two massive spheres that made up his ass.<br />
<br />
And all the while he was ferociously hungry, his new 500 pound body demanding that he fortify it with several pounds more food if he could.  The only positive note was that, in his last humiliating tumble, the remote for the TV had ended up right under the overstuffed sausages of the fingers of his right hand.<br />
<br />
He channel surfed and stopped on some show displaying male models on the catwalk.  They now looked impossibly, thin, like stick figures, like an alien species to Merritt.  He looked down at his gynecomastia ad absurdum chest.  Did I really look like that?  I don&#39;t feel like I could ever have looked like that.  Not now.  He tried to remember the feeling of being so joyfully slender, so light on his feet.  But after a couple hours of being impossibly obese, he couldn&#39;t conjure up such feelings.<br />
<br />
He watched part of a nature show on elephants and then an espn broadcast of sumo wrestling.  But he noted, with chagrin, that none of those guys were anywhere near as heavy as his 500 pounds.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have to slim down to be a sumo wrestler,&quot; he sighed.<br />
<br />
Finally, he felt the electromagnetic wave pass through him again.  His spirits leaped.  He&#39;d lost track of the time.  The five hours was up.<br />
This time, he wished the change was instantaneous.  But it took the same 5 minutes.  His rolls of fat slowly diminished.  He narrowed and narrowed.  His massive gut deflated.  His beach ball sized buns became round, for a slender track star and tight as a drum again.  Finally, even his face became defined, cheekbones and jaw showing clearly again.<br />
He was his 165 pound self again.  He jumped for joy, slapping the ceiling.  <br />
But he thought about this quite soberly and turned the Chronivac toward the apartment across the hall.  Suzanne&#39;s profile showed.   Merritt reset her natural weight 75 pounds lighter.</p>
