<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I have been better.” said Christina as she looked at the news, her religious nut case of a brother had just come on the TV and talked about taking away her right as a person, not just a monster but as a person. He had not called for her to be murdered but to remain behind walls and have all her rights stripped away and knowing her brother she wouldn’t have been surprised if he had wanted to say to have them all killed. Her thoughts where interrupted when her phone rang, she looked down and raised an eyebrow. It was his sister calling, she was the only member of her family who remained in contact with her, she is the only one who accepted that she was a monster, a woman and gay. The most her parents did was her mother sending a birthday and a Christmas card which was addressed to her old name and saying she was praying for a cure for his monster hood. She had never told her about Barbara. <br />
<br />
“It’s my sister.” said Christina as she answered the phone.<br />
<br />
“Hello.” said Christina<br />
<br />
“Chris.” said her sister, Liza. Being called Chris, her old male name didn’t really offend her, she answered to it for her work and even around the house. <br />
<br />
“Liza…what is wrong?” inquired Christina <br />
<br />
“Keep it down, mom and dad would kill me if they found out and so would Michael and Mary.” said Liza under her breath. Michael and Mary where her brother and sister-in-law, not that he really liked either of them at the moment. <br />
<br />
“What is wrong?” inquired Christina again as Barbara sat beside her at the table. <br />
<br />
“It’s Luke.” answered Liza as Christina remembered her godson and his niece, he would be 5 maybe 6 now, same age as his twin sister. She remembered the smile on her parents face when they held their first grandchildren after so many attempts/failed pregnancies. “He came down with the monster flu.”<br />
<br />
“I see…well it isn’t the end of the world.” said Christina as she felt like slapping her sister, was she saying coming down with the flu was bad. “There are communities now where humans can live within the walls if their loved one is…”<br />
<br />
“They are abounding him.” Interrupted Liza as Christina’s eyes widened. <br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Christina amazed that Michael and Mary would even consider that, they had struggles with the pregnancy and to give up her kids was horrifying and against even basically human nature.   <br />
<br />
“They had an infected kid at the church’s kindergarten, Luke started to show symphonies and it was confirmed about an hour ago. We are waiting on test results for Sarah but….” said Liza as suddenly a cry of pain and his sister-in-law crying out for God came over the phone. <br />
<br />
“I guess she is infected as well.” said Christina <br />
<br />
“It’s a good guess.” answered Liza “Listen that SOB brother of ours was already looking at how to abound his son since he came down with the flu, he will dump his daughter in a heartbeat.”<br />
<br />
Christina’s fist was tight, so tight that Barbara reached over and put her hand on top of hers. She was clearly hearing everything as she spoke up.<br />
<br />
“We have to take them.” stated Barbara with force in her voice, she wouldn’t take no for an answer as Christina looked at her, she wasn’t even going to ask what type of monster the two kids where becoming. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Whispered Christina with tears in her eyes as Barbara smiled. <br />
<br />
“Liza…do you know what type of monster they are becoming?” inquired Christina<br />
<br />
“No…I don’t think they really care. You should have seen the look on Michael’s face when they got the news yesterday, it was nothing but rage.” stated Liza<br />
<br />
“Wait…yesterday.” Inquired Christina “He was just on TV and he was calling for the rights of us to be stripped away.”<br />
<br />
“And he does not care, does this surprise you?” inquired Liza “They where waiting to send Luke to the center because of paperwork and now they are adding Sarah to that paperwork, he and Mary are signing over their parental rights.”<br />
<br />
“Alright…do you know what center they are going to?” inquired Christina, there was multiple centers across the nation, and each was numbered.<br />
<br />
“Yours.” answered Liza “That is why I called, Mom didn’t want to bring it up with the rest of the family but she asked me to call you and see if you will take them.”<br />
<br />
That actually took Christina by surprise, her mother hadn’t done much to reach out to her but maybe when it came to her only grandkids, she was much more forgiving about monsters. She was always family focused and having her grandkids grow up with family was the most important. <br />
<br />
“Does she know I am gay?” inquired Christina<br />
<br />
“Actually, she does.” Admitted Liza “I got drunk and told her, she wasn’t happy, but she understood that things changed because of the virus.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, can you tell the Doctor’s or hospital staff about us, lets hope they can smooth out the process.” Said Christina<br />
<br />
“I’ll talk to one of the staff here…thanks bid sis.” Said Liza as suddenly she heard her father yelling for her sister. “I got to go, I love you.”<br />
“love you to.” said Christina as the call ended and she put down the phone.<br />
<br />
“I guess it was a good thing we got a 3-bedroom apartment.” said Barbara with a laugh. “I guess you will have to give up your office.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” said Christina as she pulled Barbara into a kiss who quickly returned it. “I love you, so much.”<br />
<br />
“It is the right thing to do, I have heard too many horror stories about parents throwing out gay kids, I will not stand by and let two kids be thrown away because they are becoming monsters.” said Barbara as she stood up. “We better clear out the office and get both bedrooms ready to become bedrooms.”<br />
<br />
They began to work right away, clearing the office of items and moving them around. They had just finished when Christina’s phone rang and she answered it again. It was the transformation center informing her about the schedule arrival of her niece and nephew and wanting to know if she would take them.<br />
<br />
“Of course.” said Christina “Do you know what type of monsters they are becoming; it will help us plan.”<br />
<br />
She got the answer and lowered her phone as Barbara looked at her worried, if the kids where becoming a type of monster they could not handle here there would be no way to keep them. Then Christina began to chuckle. <br />
<br />
“Maybe there is a God.” Said Christina with a smile. “One is becoming a Neko like me the other is a Kitsune like you.” <br />
<br />
Barbara smiled this was almost perfect, she hadn&#39;t asked to become a mother this fast as least, she wanted to be a mother to have a family but not this soon but this was fate knocking on their door, they had to answer.</p>
