<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And so many things she wanted to try. She’d gathered enough from years of foreplay to know that the new, sexual instruments at her fingertips required effort to play well. Sliding a few fingers between the slick soft folds should’ve been a good start, but the intensity of first touch made her knees buckle. It wasn’t a shot of untempered pleasure but rather a grope of unprepared flesh. Like digging around in a nose when you just wanted to scratch it. Easing back slowly, she found a buffer against the tenderness. <br />
<br />
It rose from that gentle scratch to a mounting, insistent rhythm. Her legs, now far too weak, were not ready. Swaying softly towards the bed, she kept her legs spread as her fingers found the right purchase against slippery folds. Once she knew what it could handle, vigorous circles brought her squirming against the mattress. It was good. It was so good. And yet she felt she could get more. <br />
<br />
The problem was keeping the rhythm without playing an off-note. Going harder didn’t help and kindled an old memory of a less experienced Justin who thought he knew how to fuck well but the nervous blonde beneath him kept interrupting. Emulating the motions he’d done then, it was easy to catch the mistakes. If that Justin was fucking herself now, she’d be just as frustrated. Slowing her pace, she felt something like regret. If only for a moment. <br />
<br />
Splitting time between her tits and her pussy made the whole thing even more complicated. Nipples and warm soft breasts were not an easy conduit for instant orgasms. The sender and the receiver were connected but the message needed translation. She wanted more hands, hands touching the places she couldn’t reach, and more. Though those hands wouldn’t know where she needed them. <br />
<br />
The lingering smell of semen remained in the bed and during a lull in pace. She sought it out. Drawing the blanket closer to her, Justin found the damp patches. It was crusty by now but still her tongue curiously probed what was left and tried to rub it over the softest parts of her body. Sticky crust covered one nipple and that was all she got. Once her mind pondered whether her own jizz could get her pregnant, she took a deep breath and tried to think. <br />
<br />
The newness and some mind altering nonsense we’re working together to strip her of her normal sense. She was a man, she was going to get back to normal and this was just a sexy experiment and a misunderstanding with a dumb bitch. Already, she was learning nuance to her foreplay. The intimate wetness warming her folds felt strange but exciting for the deep, rising wellspring of arousal. Getting wet, slippery, and prepared instead of hard, engorged, and slick with pre-cum for the plunge was not an intuitive translation. She expected something more and, true, much was missing. Equipment to augment her poor, delicate stiff hand. A partner. A couple rounds of practice did much to increase her knowledge and intuition but also left her sticky and unsatisfied. <br />
<br />
It had promise though, if he could break through the recipe or formation or whatever it was that got things going at a full tilt. Then, he could have any woman in the palm of his hand. And have climaxes unlike anything he ever felt. So close so close, so achingly close to something. That’s how it felt. Just need a little more time or a little push. The hairdryer was weirdly shaped and would never fit, although he hadn’t considered anal play. The lamp wouldn’t work either and nothing else quite had the shape and rigidity she was yearning for. <br />
<br />
Sashaying to her feet, she inspected the room again as her breasts bounded a little with each step. She was getting used to them surprisingly fast but it was fun to look down. The only names she could possibly come up with for the safe were Celia and Lacie. Neither rung any kind of bell and just received errors. She had to be missing something. <br />
<br />
Walking away from the chest of drawers, she approached the side mirror and peered along the length of the wall with the bed against it. There was something on the side. It looked like a plushy. Hoisting the blankets and folding them over top, she discovered a brown, fluffy teddy bear sprawled across the carpet in the gap. Not even thinking about it, she lifted it up and inspected its simple face and nose. The tingles that followed were not unexpected and actually gave her a rush of exhilaration. What would be next? <br />
<br />
She even embraced and squeezed the little Teddy against her soft boobs, as though trying to press out all the transformative energy. The now-familiar tingles visited expected territory. Another little dip to her waistline to play up her increasingly rounded hips. They took on childbearing heights, a notion which sent an electric but not entirely unwelcome feeling through her body. The small advantage against a woman’s average height vanished as she stood at the same level she’d seen so many times, but looking down.<br />
<br />
The flush of her face brought her lips out even further, thinned her reddish eyebrows into a seductive accent, and locked her voice into the high end of soprano. The nether tingles worked on her curvy ass, and twisted her slick folds like a vice turned inside out. Her pussy was so tight that it practically felt like it wanted to rub her fingernails off. She couldn’t take it and there was still one more left.<br />
<br />
As she barely stayed on her feet with a finger clamped between her thighs, Justin enjoyed the soft warm weight building to deeper, heavier proportions across her chest. Now these were sexy tits. The kind her male self would admire as a swath of cleavage or cradled in a slim bikini. As a connoisseur, drowning in feminine arousal, he had to place them firmly as a D cup. A full, luscious D cup that earned that with weight and jiggles. They were like the soft, rounded equivalent of the ripped, bulging muscle man. Playing with them took a full hand each and she only had one for her chest and one for her tight pussy. Not fair!<br />
<br />
The jutting disk of the nipple swelled. The size felt unreal to touch and know as a part of her flesh. Despite all the sensations and the time she had to adjust, it felt strikingly unreal. Some lingering part of her expected to wake up in her bed as the man she’d always been, with quite a hard-on and a mess to clean up. These tits were inescapable though, not so much anchors as announcing, weighted pillows that she’d never be able to hide with all the ace bandages in the world. And yet, more than anything, she wanted them bigger. See how they felt, pressing monumentally from her chest. More more… See if they feel better huge. Replace the consummate man with a huge dick with the absolute, stacked woman.<br />
<br />
Her mind was already on the obvious traps still left. How far might they take her? What kind of slut would she be? Before she could act, the voice spoke up, “Getting a little big there. Would Justin of a few hours ago even recognize you? No worries though, I hope you had fun. I’m going to give you the answer. You see, I was a little tricky. While that safe shows five slots for letters, it can actually accept six. And there are six letters in my name… Claire. Do you remember me? Why don’t you come accept your prize and way out?”<br />
<br />
Claire. Oh, Claire… Yeah, he remembered. It had to be that Claire back in junior year of college. She had red hair, though with a sandy, vaguely auburn tilt. And she was stacked. Even bigger than she was now. Claire was always fun at the frat parties, willing to drink everyone else under the table. They had a good time for a few weeks. Then he got her really fucked up. <br />
<br />
She was horny as hell after downing a concoction of his own making. He ate her out and made her scream that she was in heaven. Then, he found a big buzzing vibrator in her bag and convinced her to use it while he filmed the whole thing. It was going to be their private sex tape. But one thing led to another and it made it all the way across campus and into several places of the Internet. Claire raged at him when she found out, saying that everyone was calling her Doc Double D’s. At the time, he thought she should be grateful. After all, he made her the most popular girl on campus. She could have anyone. She slapped him so hard it stung for days. <br />
<br />
Yeah, it made sense this was her. She had so many crazy ideas about genetic replacement and activating cells and all sorts of crap he yawned about. And she tested it on her. And she wanted more. <br />
<br />
Part of it was not wanting to play by her rules since she basically told her to go open the locked box and see what was inside. But what would happen if the other things she noticed in the room were prepared for her as well, extras… spare booby traps? What else might they do? How might those make her feel?<br />
<br />
The first she picked out was the perfume still left in the drawer. Lifting it up, she gave a few squirts on her neck as the tingles returned. It didn’t seem like there was a whole lot left for the compound or whatever it was to work on. Yet, the tingles still managed to carve her waist and hips into a seductive, goddess-like hourglass. Her nails were perfect on delicate soft fingers still eager to dive between her legs. She got even shorter without dipping all the way into petite. And that ass could now definitively be considered a bubble butt to challenge all the online hotties he saved. Wide load jeans or yoga pants from now on. A pervasive, incessant slipperiness lived in her crotch. She desperately needed to get fucked and she didn’t care how. Grinding against the counter would be the best for now. Her moans rose so high that even a few, gasped words sounded like they belonged on a sex talk line.<br />
<br />
And her bust soon developed beyond the memorable scope of Claire’s knockers. They dangled but also lifted away from her chest. They were heavy but felt so warm and soft. What once were normal nipples, looked like swollen, jutting bulbs with vast, swirling bumpy areolas. She jiggled them with light steps and felt hypnotized by how they swayed and bounced. No one could ignore them, and everyone would see.<br />
<br />
The voice of Claire spoke up again as she braced against the bed and played with her new acquisitions. “Well, well looks like Justin, the manliest of men, always secretly wanted to be a busty lady. I hope I haven’t broken your brain too much. By the way, Claire is spelled C-L-A-I-R-E. I hope you can manage that.”<br />
<br />
But she was already on her way over to the cabinet and opening the right side with the bra top and heels, although she suspected that the bra was already well past fitting her. She slid her feet around in the heels until it was clear the tingles were starting up again.<br />
<br />
And they went right for her boobs and nowhere else. The weighty and increasingly absurd tits flowed out like a contained liquid beneath her flesh. Just containing one boob took both both hands desperately sinking into the pliable, warm softness. <br />
<br />
When Claire spoke this time, she sounded a little different, as though uncertain, “You actually want those monstrosities? Jesus, I must’ve dosed you too hard. Well, you do you…or rather you will soon.”<br />
<br />
Justin barely heard her as she reached for the bra on the hanger and could only use it as a drape for her pendulous tits. The last tingles swelled her boobs deep into specialty bra territory while keeping them jutting and round. It was only then that her horny mania seemed to abate.<br />
<br />
Looking down at the quivering, jiggling bust which cloaked all signs of her lower body at the same angle, Justin could only squeak a girlish note of, “Oh, God…”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take Claire long to say, with a chuckle, “I hope you like that size. You really should go get your reward, I know you’ll enjoy it.”  <br />
<br />
Feeling the weight tugging on her back, shoulders, and pits so incessantly that they already gave a dull ache, Justin carefully jiggled her way towards the safe. Getting her hands in the right place without support took a bit of effort along with pushing the edges of her breast flesh away. <br />
<br />
C-L-A-I-R-E. Typing the letters resulted in a harmonious beep, followed by the door swinging open. Justin wasn’t sure what to expect inside, but her eyes widened at the lengthy, pink vibrator wand resting on the bottom. Claire didn’t need to tell her what to do. <br />
<br />
Sprawling across the bed again, Justin trembled and slid the power button on. Immediately, a vigorous warm buzzing filled the device and rippled through her body where she held it close to her thigh. <br />
<br />
While one hand wielded the wand in approaching circles up and down and firmly around as it sought her slick folds, the other frantically squeezed, roamed, and lost itself in her massive boobs. The buzzing and vibrating energy was the missing ingredient, the true way to play the instrument.<br />
<br />
Justin bucked her wide hips in the air, hunting for some hot, illusory dick to slip inside her. She panted and moaned without a care beyond the waterfall of wet pleasure spreading from her core to her entire body in waves that refused to end. It was beyond her comprehension, it was heaven and more. Screw having a dick, this was true sex and yet it was only a glimpse, as she could imagine being fucked with the real thing. She screamed and moaned and humped the air as she crested and exploded into her first glorious orgasm. The shock waves resounded over every soft inch of her trembling body. She never knew, she never imagined it could feel so fucking good. <br />
<br />
“Enjoy it. I know everyone watching is. This is streaming on the biggest porn sites on the web. Give your fans a smile. I wonder what… Clever nicknames they’ll give you, Ruby. Keep the toy, consider it my gift. Although I suspect you want to replace it with something even better. Get some sleep, and when you wake up you’ll get to see what your choices have made of the rest of your life. Farewell, Justin.”<br />
<br />
With that, a creeping, all-consuming sleepiness, with a sensation like the tingles, wrapped around Justin’s transformed body and achy eyes. In just a few seconds, she was asleep.</p>
