<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Zeta legion led an assault on Dr.Smith&#39;s massive satellite base between Earth and Venus.  The Chancellor of the Dominion instructed the Zeta legion to burn everything to the ground and kill Dr. Smith on sight. However, Rachel struck a deal with the Zeta Grand Commander. Rachel would give the Zeta legion first dibs on deploying her bioweapon and in exchange, the Zeta legion would bring Dr. Smith alive with all of his work.<br />
<br />
Rachel wanted his work preserved as it would be used to enhance her bioweapon. She was able to reverse engineer some old chemicals of his into her weapon that would it where all boys would mentally transform and accept their fate as girls and not want to turn back at all. Coupled with the fact the mutants had no one to control them the boy&#39;s ace in the hole would be useless, the Dominion would have a secured victory. She also wanted to persevere the work because when the Dominion goes into peacetime she would need it.<br />
<br />
The Chancellor has already appointed Rachel to serve jointly as the Surgeon Master and Executive Scientific Librarian. Not only would she be in charge of the healthcare system but the preservation and advancement of scientific knowledge within the Dominion. She wants to keep boy scientific knowledge to show future generations of girls how bad the war was. The work of Dr.Smith would be the jackpot.<br />
<br />
While she is glad to serve the Dominion she knows she will be badly staffed due to the attack on Earth. But some other technologies Dr. Smith developed would help her. Like the chemicals, she reverse-engineered the brainwave controlling technology Dr. Smith made. This set of technology allowed Dr. Smith to control people with modifications to either the subjects&#39; brain’s biochemical pathways or through specialized devices and they obeyed his unique brainwaves only. Rachel used these same techniques so instead of a mindless husk being controlled by Dr. Smith, he would be utterly submissive to someone superior Dr. Rachel Covaks.<br />
<br />
Dr. Smith had two submission chips implanted in both his brain’s frontal lobe and spinal cord. He also wore a specialized submission collar making him submissive to Rachel and could be controlled via her brain waves only. While this is overkill it is both practical and poetic. She would get new submissive help plus it would be a reminder to Dr. Smith, his greatest creation would be his undoing.<br />
<br />
However, Rachel is not done, she is repulsed by Dr. Smith, and having a 67 year old man around doesn&#39;t fit well with an all-girl society. So, Dr. Covaks is replacing him with someone a bit more pleasant.... herself.<br />
<br />
Inside the chamber, there is a specialized version of her weapon. It would transform him into a completely submissive clone of Dr. Rachel Crowns.<br />
<br />
He woke up as Rachel was about to press the button. He had a grin on his face and then he saw the collar and realized he was defeated and had a general idea of his fate. He had only four words<br />
<br />
”Good game, Dr.Covaks”<br />
<br />
Rachel gave him a cold glare and pressed the button. A light pink mist covered the room and Dr. Smith inhaled the gas. The heavily modified retrovirus in the gas was entering his bloodstream ready to work. His frail old body became younger and his rough patchy skin became soft and smooth. He felt pain as his spine was decompressing and becoming bigger as his height increased from 5’7’’ to 5’11’’. He felt like he was gaining muscle and he gained Rachel’s toned athletic hourglass figure. He felt her ample C cup breasts form on his chest. His green eyes becoming blue and his skull reshaped with long dark hair flowing out. She moaned as her new vagina formed. Then she had a headache as her neurons were being manipulated and Rachel’s mind took over and then the parietal lobe of the clone was altered to pick up the brain waves of the original Rachel. Then the chips and collar activated.<br />
<br />
This new Rachel (Rachel-2) is now completely submissive to the original (Rachel-1). Rachel-1 looked at the monitors and saw the chips and collar are now active. Plus she can feel the mental connection with her clone. Even though she should wait like every other test subject her curiosity got the better of her and just in case she kept her laser scalpel handy. Rachel-1 let down the plasma wall and her clone/twin Rachel-2 crawled on all fours and kissed her feet.<br />
<br />
”Master thank you for curing me of that vile disease and making me pure and giving me the same heavenly form you have. I wish to serve you and bring glory to the dominion of girl.” Rachel-2 said crying tears of intense joy<br />
<br />
Rachel-1 is an incredibly beautiful woman. She gets looks from other women within the dominion all the time. However, Rachel-1 never acted on asking any women out because she was always busy either with being a doctor or developing the bioweapon. While she isn&#39;t a narcissist something about turning her archrival into a submissive clone of herself that is currently kissing her feet is arousing to her and she feels her panties get damp.<br />
<br />
”Dammit Rachel, there is a war that needs to be won, also she&#39;s you dammit!” Rachel-1 thought to herself<br />
<br />
Yet her horniness got the better of her. She is going to win the war for the Dominion she could afford a break plus she isn&#39;t going to have sex with her clone. It&#39;s just a fancy field test nothing more. Trying to give herself a reason to fuck her submissive clone.<br />
<br />
Rachel-1 decided to strip down and take off her lab coat and pants. She let her long hair out of the braid. She ordered Rachel-2 to get up and wiped the tears off her face. She then kissed her twin with an intense passion. She yanked Rachel-2’s hair and flicked at her nipples causing Rachel-2 to moan<br />
<br />
”Master yes”<br />
<br />
Rachel-1 then used the handle of her laser scalpel as a dildo on Rachel-2’s asshole and pussy. Rachel-1 licked the handle enjoying the scent and taste of her vaginal fluids. Rachel-2 then licked Rachel-1’s pussy. During their post-orgasm glow, Rachel-2 asked a question<br />
<br />
”My Master I love you, but when will we wipe all men from existence with our weapon?”<br />
<br />
”Soon my love soon,” Rachel-1 said before kissing Rachel-2 tenderly<br />
<br />
While the chancellor will be upset that Rachel didn&#39;t tell her about her secret project and convincing the Zeta legion to defy her direct orders, she would ultimately praise Dr. Rachel Covaks for creating the war ending weapon and adding a great scientist to her administration even if said new scientist is a sexually submissive clone of Dr. Rachel Covaks.</p>
