<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Stephanie reached behind her and started to disrobe, taking off her white shirt as Derrick had turned his back to look over his tools at his desk.  When he turned back around, she had already stepped out of her pants and was beginning to pull one shoulder-strap of her yellow bikini down her upper arm.  He quickly turned back around so as not to look at her.</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder, wondering if he'd seen something, then back at Derrick and asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would use the screen to undress," Derrick said.</p>

<p>"Look at these," she said dropping the strap off her left side, and cupping her breasts as Derrick looked back at her.  "Fur covered isn't exactly nude," she smirked, but she wasn't completely right.  Her nipples were black, and seemed to harden a bit as the cool current of the room's AC crossed her chest.  "Besides, if you were going to try something, you'd have done it by now… like what Kenneth tried to do back in the locker room at the beach," she gave as an example, pulling the strap down her other shoulder.</p>

<p>"Most women still care about men seeing them without clothing," Derrick offered, not looking away as she'd asked him to look at her.</p>

<p>Denise smiled across Stephanie's face as he thought about Derrick.  Classic chivalrist approach to women.  He had been polite and curious this whole time, and even a little bashful.  <i>Stephanie would really appreciate this guy if she were real,</i> he thought about it.  <i>I guess I should start trying to play more In-Character if I'm going to be in this for the long haul… no telling how useful Derrick will be if I brush him off too early,</i> Denise thought, trying to plan several steps ahead.</p>

<p>Stephanie smiled and stepped up to Derrick, wearing nothing but her fur, yellow-rimmed glasses, and a wide smile across her face.  She stepped up to him and leaned in, running a hand over his shoulder and sniffing just to the side of his face.  "I'm not most women," she offered, and it was true.  She grinned and raised her tail, smirking and stepping back over to the table, her hips swaying just as she'd seen her mom do once or twice.</p>

<p>Derrick blinked, but smiled.  <i>I think she likes me,</i> he considered as he watched her climb up onto the slab that was designed not unlike the hospital bed she'd been on early… a V-shaped concave that allowed her to sit back against the table, but also lay down as it took her weight and put her basically flat and parallel to the floor.  Stepping over to the table, he slid his tool table up beside him, and looked at her.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give you a little tablet about the side of a mint to place under your tongue," he said as he reached for it and held it up over her head for her to see.  It was orange in color, "It will numb your pain receptors and loosen your muscles.  This will allow you to be awake through the procedure, but you will be unable to move… this is so you do not accidentally flinch or otherwise while I'm trying to connect or disconnect muscles and nerves," he explained.  "You will, of course, be able to teamspeak and guildspeak, but little else," he said.  "Since this is boring for many, I can offer to put a small viewer over you so you can watch what I'm doing," he said.</p>

<p>Stephanie turned to look at him, ready to get this over with.  "Please.  I don't speak with my own voice, Out of Character," she explained.  "I'm trying to get into this role, and I don't want people associating me with that voice instead of Stephanie's.  Without speaking to you, I'd be rather bored… so yes, a viewer would be nice."</p>

<p>Derrick nodded, reaching for a remote and clicking a button on it that brought down a hovering HDTV set just over the bed where Stephanie could see it.  He gave her the little mint-looking tablet, and she placed it under her tongue.  "It will last until the procedure is over and then end immediately," he explained.  "Wonders of video game logic," he smirked.</p>

<p>"Of course," she say and laid back, looking up as the tablet began to work it's magic.  It was an interesting feeling.  Slowly there was a warm and numb feeling that went across Stephanie's whole body not unlike the time she was heavily medicated from her bout with the the Flu the year before.  She could feel Derrick placing his hands on her ankle, moving it, but it was like a distant dream.</p>

<p>Denise had never seen someone's insides, having not yet had a Biology class as he was only just finishing Primary School.  True, he was a little ahead for his age, but that just went along with his other "problem", he figured.  Here he was close to summer and Junior-High school was just around the corner.  Bigger kids, bigger playgrounds.</p>

<p>Still, when Derrick Bolo reached over her with some kind of curved saw, Stephanie thought to regret her choice for just a moment before he jerked it once, twice, then three times straight up and down her chest, breaking a straight line in the cartilage holding her ribs together.  Her eyes went a little wide as he inserted some kind of metal device with soft ends on it.  A motor made a kind of frighteningly loud sound as the device slowly pushed open her chest bones as Derrick pulled back her skin.</p>

<p>She watched him with a detached interest over the monitor straight ahead as she could feel him actually moving his hands around inside of her, even though it didn't hurt.  As she watched, he slowly cut away the bits of her insides that were attached to her left most lung, and slowly cut it completely out, using different medical tools to soak up blood and keep her other lung inflated.  He took the lung and placed it into a medical container off to the side of the tray and walked away from the table.</p>

<p>As Stephanie could only look at the screen, she couldn't see where he had gone and could only stare as her one lung slowly inflated and deflated, watching as her internal organs did their duties and the light pressure of the AC once again touching not just her fur but her internals.</p>

<p>Derrick's hands reappeared over her holding something that looked like a side of shingles or an accordion in the shape of a lung.  They were blue and white and somewhat transparent and seemed to have multiple layers across them.  He laid the one slowly into her chest and began the process of reattaching it to her internals.  As he finished, she could only watch wide-eyed as the new lung began to fill and empty air just as her other one did, but her breathing was a bit strange… a feeling of only being partly full.</p>

<p>As Derrick proceeded to do the same with the other lung, she couldn't help but think that this was amazing.  Her she was, becoming part machine just like in a science fiction movie somewhere.  Her breathing sped up a bit, and her wide eyes of amazement soothed into alert eyes of wonder.  She watched each and every movement he made with his hands, and couldn't help but feel an energy serge within her.</p>

<p>As the second lung was inserted, she noticed that it seemed dual-layered.  She hadn't noticed that on the first one… almost like she would now have four lungs.  Even then, with the second one mirrored to the first, she noticed that her lungs barely moved at all as she breathed… almost like she was taking small breaths.  She took a moment to collect her thoughts then slowly began to take in a deep breath.  Doing so, she took in a long breath that didn't seem to take a full minute when she did so.  At the end, it seemed they were as large as her old lungs, but must have been eight times the capacity.</p>

<p>Derrick slid his tray around closer to Stephanie's legs, he sniffed the air as if smelling something for the first time.  Though she couldn't see it, his tail flicked once or twice as he noted a smell he'd rarely caught before.  It seemed Stephanie was rather enjoying the surgery, because the scent of her arousal was floating just in the air.  He hadn't expected that, but it kind of made him smile.  <i>Not most women,</i> he thought to himself.</p>

<p>"Hope you're enjoying yourself," he commented offhandedly, but thought it sounded silly after he said it.  Neither Denise nor Stephanie truly understood what it was Derrick was replying to, but that was mostly due to all the contacts being numbed down.  The feeling of Derrick taking a metal brace and effectively welding her ribcage back together didn't feel like much, nor even the sewing of her skin back together.</p>

<p>Derrick moved the camera and his attention down to Stephanie's left leg.  He took out a vibrating knife and ran it along her leg from heels on up to her thighs.  The knife itself never touched the skin.  Merely getting it close to her leg cut the skin with a precision that was amazing.  She watched with a detached notion that the leg she was looking at was her own, but the act itself kept her attention.</p>

<p>Over the next hour and a half, Stephanie watched the results of what Derrick had told her were minigames for himself.  The metallic additional muscles and weights in her legs that took up little space and were very light weight were quite a sight to watch.  When he moved up to her hands, the replacement of her short claws with ones she could flex and bring outward was a much more complicated afair than she had thought it would be.</p>

<p>At the end, she saw Derrick reach up to her mouth with a smile, leaning close and saying, "Take this… you'll need it," with a grin.  He placed a small tube inside her mouth and it emptied into her some kind of cold liquid that felt hard going down.  A few moments later, there was the feeling of something all inside of her growling harder and heavy like stone.  "You should feel your bones being coated in metal… with any luck, they will withstand quite a lot of damage and pressure," he said as he began to move the table so she would sit upward.  "Now, the most painful part of this is going to be you coming out of the numbness.  It's going to hurt quite a lot if I haven't done all my work right," he said simply.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the pain hit her as if she'd been hit by a car in a parking lot.  Her body seized, her arms going up and crossing her chest as she hissed in air at the sudden rush of fire across her nerves as the medicine wore off completely.  She squinted her eyes shut a bit, tears welling up at their edges, but somewhere deep inside a little part of her took a deep breath of satisfaction.  The pain made it real and not some video game… it all meant something, and she was stronger than she had been before in her life… and she would only get stronger.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Stephanie said, taking in all the pain, laughing a bit as her head went back against the plate at her back.  "I will remember this," she smiled, thinking the pain was kind of nice.  She noticed for the first time that the air running across her nipples felt extra close, and that there was a strange kind of wetness to her crotch.</p>

<p>She glanced down, furious to think for a moment that perhaps her body had wet itself while she was numb.  When she looked down, there was a light line of pink between her legs as her vagina had opened up when she'd become aroused.  The feeling was different, and kind of enjoyable… but she decided not to "check" it while Derrick was at her side.</p>

<p>"I will be back for that OFM once I have a few more levels to my name," she smirked.  "Perhaps tomorrow?" she grinned, trying to take a breath as she ran her hands between her breasts and over the long wound between them.  She moved her hand passed over her right breast and squeezed it a bit, thinking it felt a little warm and tingly and not knowing why.</p>

<p>Derrick, who had tried to focus on his work while she was drugged, was becoming distracted both by her scent and by her actions.  Stephanie sniffed the air at the same time as he did, and they both looked at each other.  He looked away first, and she didn't understand why again.  "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Your smell," he said, slowly looking back at her nude form.  "It's rare that I have a woman who is turned on by having her innards replaced," he offered.  "Kind of made me feel good about my work," he smirked.</p>

<p><i>Turned on?  I'm turned on?  Well, yeah, it was really interesting, but… wait, that means that Stephanie smells like a skunk woman who's turned on by a guy,</i> Denise realized, watching Derrick's eyes.  <i>OK, so… I don't know what to do with that,</i> he realized, as he moved to get off the table.</p>

<p>She put a single paw on the floor and it was colder than she had remembered.  She glanced around, not sure what to do, and ended up putting a hand on Derrick's shoulder.  "You know how to work your tools," she smirked, and stepped away to pick up her cloths.  He almost said something, but she quickly asked, "Is Nala ready for me downstairs?" she wondered.</p>

<p>Derrick nodded, "Yup."</p>

<p>"Excellent," she said, not bothering to put on her swimsuit, and just putting on her shirt and pants as she walked back over to him.  "It was nice meeting you, Derrick.  I'm sure you'll see me again," she grinned, holding a hand out for him to shake.  He did so, and she walked back towards the door that lead out to the main room.</p></p>
