<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In Seattle, Tom put aside his thoughts over &quot;Moon Lake&quot; and simply held Alice to him. The feel of her soft fur against his and her body pressing against his. It all felt so good and being with her made him feel so very happy. It&#39;s like he instinctively knew he&#39;d found the one who would always be with him and would do anything to support him and who he&#39;d do anything to support in return. As he did so, he seemed to feel a flash of images through his mind. He saw himself and Alice at one of Seattle&#39;s churches with many of his coworkers at the paper along with a fair number of people he didn&#39;t recognize but seemed to be built along the same lines as Alice. They watched as Alice walked toward him in a beautiful white dress. He saw himself working on an article and looking frustrated but then looking much better as Alice came up behind him with her belly in a very gravid state of pregnancy. He saw himself and Alice, both in their fursonas with three children clutching at their legs in what looked like the West Wing of the White House and standing with several people in suits coming up to congratulate Tom and complimenting Alice and their family. He saw himself and in a futuristic setting, their hair gray and their fur grizzled, sitting happily in a Seattle park and watching the sun set with Alice&#39;s head  resting on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be together forever,&quot; Tom then declared, &quot;at&#39;s strange... but... I can see us... together... forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the bond between us forming within you,&quot; Alice smiled back to him, &quot;We werefoxes can be very sexual... and among our fellow weres, we are the most open about it. We instinctively know exactly where to touch to get the most pleasure out of our partners, and there is nothing wrong with that. After all... with our high libidos... why truly be ashamed of it when every were enjoys it? But once we find that one person... the one who is most important to us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice leaned forward to kiss Tom passionately, and softly ran her paws down his sides. It served to get his penis to rise up and out of his sheath, though for the moment it was pressed between them and was tickled by the fur on Alice&#39;s belly and on his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bond forms, it shows us that our partner is the one we&#39;ll live with for the rest of our lives and the one we&#39;ll love and support forever,&quot; Alice smiled, &quot;I began to feel it form within me when we talked. You&#39;re smart... you&#39;re honest... you shared things about your childhood with me that by all means you had no need to. It made me happy and told me YOU were the one to be my mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad it did,&quot; Tom smiled back, &quot;because it makes me happy to be with you. Together we can get through anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two kissed again, though by now Alice was all too aware of her mate&#39;s throbbing erection and Tom could feel Alice&#39;s growing arousal as well. Tom slowly walked Alice back toward the bed to begin another round of love-making when he noticed Alice&#39;s discarded bra on the floor, the letter C clearly written on its tag.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to ask something,&quot; Tom spoke as he cupped one of Alice&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Alice answered as she moaned at Tom&#39;s touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get these F cup glories into a C cup bra?&quot; Tom asked, slightly teasing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly... I&#39;d gotten a bit behind on my laundry,&quot; Alice admitted, and pausing to moan as Tom gently eased his penis into her, and then continued, &quot;So... I was left to try and squeeze into something I wore when I was fifteen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifteen?&quot; Tom wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We weres don&#39;t do anything small,&quot; Alice smiled as she began to thrust her hips forward to match her mate&#39;s thrusts into her, &quot;females have big breasts with our smallest size for an adult being a D cup and can range to werecows at the largest end of the spectrum for chest size at a J cup at the largest...&quot;  Alice paused to give a barking yip as she felt her body quiver in orgasm, both from Tom&#39;s large erect member pistoning in and out of her vaginal opening but from the soft touch of his paws over every point that gave her pleasure on her body, &quot;And males have their huge dicks and well toned muscles. It leaves all weres built for what we&#39;re presently doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifteen?&quot; Tom repeated.<br />
<br />
At this Alice caught on, and then answered, &quot;Were puberty is a bit different from a Normal human&#39;s puberty. Males and females will enter puberty at the same time, usually at age fourteen and heralded with their first transformation. It&#39;ll then progress until the were turns eighteen when puberty for a were ends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is different, &quot; Tom admitted and then licked Alice&#39;s muzzle, &quot;hopefully when we get to having kids... that they don&#39;t end up too hormonal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... you,&quot; Alice only giggled and both got back to their task at hand.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Teddy and Marci eventually came out of the guest room that the Twists had provided for his transformation after a few moments and gave both the Twists a sight at what Lila had been so interested in. He was powerfully built and on the large end for the size of male weretigers with a large sheath between his legs. Both Samantha and Frances noted it, though it didn&#39;t really hold their interest. They were only interested in each other and to some degree in Martha Anderson, their next door neighbor, but their pride wasn&#39;t here at the moment. Teddy&#39;s fur also seemed to work quite well in matching Marci&#39;s. The Turkish Angora, which Marci&#39;s fursona was built around, was known for being all white and with Teddy taking on the form of a white tiger, the two matched quite well. In fact the white of their fur was almost as white as new fallen snow. The only thing that really differentiated Teddy from his wife with regard to their fur was that like any other tiger, Teddy had stripes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; Marci said again to Samantha and Frances and then to Lila, &quot;Thank you... we&#39;ve... I&#39;ve waited for this moment for so long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no trouble,&quot; Samantha said politely, &quot;it isn&#39;t everyday that we have a normal come into Moon Lake who not only knows of weres but is privately looking to join were society.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because most people outside of this town who know and have married a were have married a were that can turn them,&quot; Teddy commented calmly, his voice a deep baritone that made Marci snuggle to his chest, &quot;As a werecat, Marci&#39;s strain of the virus would have killed me... It&#39;s why we had to be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And potentially why your children may need to be careful, if you&#39;re in heat,&quot; Frances said to Marci.<br />
<br />
&quot;True... but...&quot; Marci said slowly and then looked to Teddy, &quot;parenthood is also something we&#39;ve been looking forward to. Largely as another thing we couldn&#39;t have until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marci smiled and looked to Teddy. He looked a lot younger than he did before with his triangular nose being a bright pink indicating youth, which for a were, both he and Marci were. He looked good and Marci was sure that the two of them would make great parents. Any male child would be a weretiger cub and any girl would be a werecat kitten. They&#39;d have plenty to talk over, but they were otherwise set. In fact, given how much Marci and Teddy had planned out him becoming a weretiger, they had been buying clothing that would likely fit his new human form over the years and had them packed. It had taken time, but they were ready for everything, and that made Marci smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Lila said with a warm smile, enjoying to see the two happy together.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime... there are still some things to discuss,&quot; Samantha said slowly, thinking over the directions to the motel and Moon Lake&#39;s rules for them to go over while they were visiting. There were also a few legal questions on what Teddy Green could help with as an FBI agent, regarding Dieter Wilhelm who was expected to arrive on Saturday to interfere in the Jenkins/Harper wedding and had already orchestrated a conspiracy that sent agents across state lines to commit a crime in Moon Lake, which in theory would give the FBI original jurisdiction on the matter. There was also issues regarding Dymixious and the fact that Lionel Ulysses&#39; murderer could threaten a fight if caught and Teddy&#39;s help and training might be needed. Teddy might not be able to help as he was on vacation and that his office wasn&#39;t in Washington State, and thus while the FBI may get jurisdiction, Teddy Green would not. They wouldn&#39;t know until they asked.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at the Howler house, Tad stood by somewhat nervously. From what they had expected, Jay and Leon wouldn&#39;t actually transform until Saturday at the earliest. Instead they had transformed on Thursday evening and night and in a situation that they&#39;d been hoping to avoid. Tad had arrived early enough that he was about to give both of them words of encouragement that they could do it and that they would be fine. It was a warm comfort that was the best that Tad could provide, though he also did have to undress Jay and Leon as they changed.<br />
<br />
They weren&#39;t as big as Tad was in his wolven form, but they were definitely bigger than they were before with well formed muscles for thirteen year olds. It let them grow strong, and as Tad gave his welcome to Jay and Leon, both brothers seemed to pant and breath heavily. Their tongues hung out of the side of the wolven muzzles as tried to catch their breath after going through their first transformation. The good news was that both looked fairly well despite the surprise of when their transformation came. Jay was largely covered in white fur that matched his sister&#39;s coat in her wolven form while Leon largely brown with what looked like salt and pepper highlights in his fur.<br />
<br />
Tad&#39;s concern ultimately came to Gary and Elizabeth Howler who came in with Amy at the tail end of Jay and Leon&#39;s transformation. Their concern over what they remembered of Amy&#39;s first transformation was something that had inspired their nervousness regarding Jay and Leon and why they ultimately accepted Tad&#39;s offer to help them. Tad had been happy to help, but Jay and Leon&#39;s first transformation had came even earlier than had been expected, by a full two days. That might give Gary and Elizabeth some reason to not trust him.<br />
<br />
&quot;My boys!&quot; Elizabeth broke the silent and rushed forward and scooped both young werewolves into her arms, &quot;My boys are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re fine, mom,&quot; Jay commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tad help us,&quot; Leon added, &quot;It... it didn&#39;t hurt that bad...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it did hurt,&quot; Gary said slowly as he looked down and noted that the rug underneath where Jay and Leon had been torn up by his son&#39;s claws as they grew out and lengthened.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was something that was always going to be there,&quot; Tad said nervously, &quot;the point of providing comfort and positive reinforcement and urging them not to fight what is a part of them emerging for the first time is lessen that pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get your point,&quot; Gary nodded slowly, and glanced to his sons, still being smothered in their mother&#39;s loving embrace, &quot;and it didn&#39;t hurt... at least not as bad as Amy&#39;s first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as bad as we can remember from that,&quot; Leon commented, though admittedly neither he nor Jay fully remembered on how bad things had been for Amy and her first transformation. However, the answer was enough to allow Gary a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... I&#39;d say your help worked, young Mr. Decker,&quot; Gary said to Tad with a soft smile, &quot;the fact that they transformed earlier than expected... but you did help our sons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could say as to why they transformed two days early,&quot; Tad said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as my boys are healthy and happy, I don&#39;t care,&quot; Elizabeth answered and continued to hold Jay and Leon and to her. <br />
<br />
Both young boys were now beginning to groan at being smothered in their mother&#39;s grasp. But with things going well, that didn&#39;t matter all that much. Amy spoke up in support of her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on... you&#39;re doing well and you do look good,&quot; Amy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t want to be smothered!&quot; Jay protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then... now that you have transformed... perhaps you could go out with Tad and Amy on their little walk,&quot; Elizabeth commented, &quot;Will that sound alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad looked to Amy and then shrugged. Amy sighed and then nodded to her mother. The offer had then hurt some of their earlier plans for the evening, but then they didn&#39;t expect Jay and Leon to transform that evening when they&#39;d made the plans. The best they could do was to go with it. As they accepted the offer, Elizabeth released her sons and they soon began to trail Tad and Amy as they headed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where are we going?&quot; Jay asked as they crossed the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll go to my house where Amy and I can disrobe and then transform,&quot; Tad spoke, &quot;from there we&#39;ll go out into the woods behind my house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And tomorrow we get our welcome to the pack?&quot; Leon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Amy nodded, &quot;depends on whether or not things remain quiet...&quot;</p>
