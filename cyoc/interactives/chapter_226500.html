<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Manly” Dan continued stroking his long hair with one hand, and his two-inch cock with the other as he looked at all the posters of hot guys and boy-bands all over his pink walls.  He heard laughing, and turned to see his friends standing in the door watching him play with his tiny cock.  He loved looking at them, they were really hot.  He started stroking faster as they were saying stuff he didn’t understand, taking their phones out and pointing them at him.<br />
<br />
Dan loved watching his hot friends as he stroked himself.  They were all laughing and seemed so happy.  One of them came over to him and said something to the other guys, and they reluctantly pocketed their phones.  His name was Joey, Dan remembered they were special friends – boyfriends.  Joey kissed Dan on the forehead, then took a brush and started brushing manly Dan’s pretty, long hair as the hairy surfer continued playing with his two-inch cock.<br />
<br />
Dan saw himself in the mirror, barely registering that the hot hairy guy playing with himself in the mirror was him.  He liked watching the other hot guy brushing his hair, it made him feel all warm and good inside.  In fact, it made him feel so good as this hot man brushed his long, pretty hair, that he found himself shooting white stuff out of his tiny cock, grunting like a dumb animal as he thrust his throbbing two-inch cock into his fist.<br />
<br />
Joey pressed his lips against Dan’s, and kissed him passionately.  Dan gasped, his boyfriend’s every touch was electric, and made his body tingle and feel special.  Dan kissed Joey back, cum was really spurting from his cock now.  All Manly Dan could think about was how girly he felt around his boyfriend Joey, how amazing Joey made him feel, and how much he wanted to please this handsome man he called his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
There was no going back for Manly Dan now, he was the gayest, girliest boy in town, and so proud to belong to his boyfriend Joey.  He always wore slutty pink outfits, his bleached  blonde hair hung to his sexy twink ass, and his absolute favorite thing was to suck his boyfriend’s cock while others watched – and he got to do it all the time.  His own little cock and balls shrank until they looked like those of a one-year-old, but that was okay because he was a total submissive bottom, completely passive and loved being fucked and sucking men.  He was nearly always precumming, and he loved doing anything and everything he could to keep his man happy.  He was totally submissive to his boyfriend, and loved every second of it.<br />
<br />
Dan would never be manly again, but he was never happier than being the girliest, gayest pussy boy he could be, or when he was pleasing men.  He adored men, and he was so very happy to be used by them as the sex object he truly was now.  He loved cock so much, and loved sucking them and the shape and taste of them filling his mouth.  Being gay was so amazing, and sucking cock was even better - there was nothing else he&#39;d rather do, or nothing else he&#39;d rather be than a flaming, gay cocksucker.<br />
<br />
His proudest moment was when he discovered he was pregnant with his boyfriend’s child after a week of marathon sex.  He felt so very close to his boyfriend now, and so very affectionate towards him.  He started thinking of himself as a girl, and felt like she was the luckiest girl in the world to have such an amazing boyfriend.  To celebrate, Joey got Dan a tramp stamp that said, “Joey’s pussy”.  Dan had never felt more love for him than he did at that moment, and absolutely loved being branded by his lover’s tattoo.  He looked forward to being Joey’s housewife, kept barefoot and pregnant, and raising their children in a nice home with lots of love – and of course lots of sex too!<br />
<br />
It was &quot;Manly&quot; Dan&#39;s joy to completely submit himself and surrender his body to his boyfriend, Joey. And he felt complete, utter joy doing so.  He was so gay and so happy to belong to Joey that all he had to do was look at his boyfriend, and is cock would start cumming without a single touch.  Dan would simply stand staring at his handsome boyfriend as a wet spot appeared on his barely tented crotch.  By the time he gave birth, his cock was only a quarter-inch nub and his balls smaller than peas; he was in complete bliss being the girl of the family, and loved when Joey brushed his long, pretty hair every night, so much so that he always came and moaned softly like the girl he really was now.  He loved being his boyfriend&#39;s bitch, now and forever!</p>
