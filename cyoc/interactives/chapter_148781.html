<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door opened up. Before Jason could fully react though, the person behind it knocked him down on the ground. &quot;Ow! That hurt!&quot; &quot;Fuck that! Change me back right now, pipsqueak!&quot; Jason locked onto the person that was on him. It was a young boy. He had to be young as Jason. On his body a wife beater hung poorly on his shoulders. He wasn&#39;t wearing any pants at all so his private parts were easily exposed. They dripped a white fluid which wet Jason&#39;s sweat pants. &quot;Eric... Is that you?&quot; &quot;You got a lot of nerve asking that! This is all your fucking fault!&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?!&quot; Eric was holding down Jason with one hand. In his other was his cell phone. &quot;This ring a bell?!&quot; Jason looked at the screen. &quot;Mr Eric. Your brother Jason wishes you were no longer his big brother, so we have decided to grant that wish. We won&#39;t hurt you, but we must grant our consumer&#39;s wish. This wish will go into affect in 0 seconds.&quot; Jason understood at once. The app had granted his wish. By turning his Big Brother into a Little Brother. &quot;No way...&quot; Jason said. &quot;Now change me back right this second!&quot; &quot;Okay! Okay! But you need to get off of me!&quot; Eric did as told and got up. His wife beater covered his modesty. Jason got up himself soon after. He noticed he was a few inches taller than Eric now, but he kept that to himself and went for his phone.<br />
<br />
Eric watched his brother get his phone. &quot;Un-fucking-believable!&quot; he thought. &quot;That pipsqueak is taller than me now!&quot; He flashbacked to how it all went wrong. After making Jason go into his room, Eric was free to jerk off to his favorite actress. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah.... Oh yeah!&quot; He came once more. He had already done it several times as evidenced by several tissues strewn across the coffee table. He couldn&#39;t stop himself yet, as a scene where he would have a good view of her bouncing breasts was about to start. But just before he began again, his phone vibrated. &quot;Just when I was getting to the good part...&quot; He grabbed the phone with his clean hand and opened it up. On the screen had a message: Mr Eric. Your brother Jason wishes you were no longer his big brother, so we have decided to grant that wish. We won&#39;t hurt you, but we must grant our consumer&#39;s wish. This wish will go into affect in 30 seconds.&quot; &quot;What the hell is this shit?&quot; The time on the message was counting down. &quot;Is this the pipsqueak&#39;s idea of a prank? Lame!&quot; He threw the phone down on the floor. &quot;Fucking moron!&quot; Eric proceeded to masturbate again. &quot;Ah,ah,ah... bet I could cum in thirty seconds. Much better then a genie app! Ah,ah,ah... Geez!&quot; Eric continued pumping his dick as the timer on the phone continued to tick down. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; The timer hit 10 seconds as Eric felt the surging at his cock. &quot;Ah,ah,ah. Oh yeah! Here it... COMES!&quot; Eric ejaculated once more, his wet hot spunk spraying his body. Once he calmed down, he looked at the timer which had five seconds left. &quot;Beat it Motherfuckers!&quot; Eric pumped his fist in the air in a show of victory. &quot;Like I said...&quot; <br />
<br />
But before he could finish the timer hit zero and that&#39;s when it happened. The cell phone screen shone brighter and brighter. &quot;What?!&quot; Eric didn&#39;t understand at first until the screen light flashed him. &quot;Gah! My eyes! What the hell?!&quot; In a panic, he covered his eyes. &quot;What&#39;s going on?! My body feels so warm!&quot; The light shone for about ten more seconds and then proceeded to fade. About ten more seconds later, the light died down completely. &quot;Ugh! That was annoying!&quot; he thought. He tried to adjust my touching his body to make sure he was all there. But where he thought his stomach was, he was already touching his penis. &quot;That&#39;s strange.&quot; Eric was touching his dick to be sure, but it felt funny. Like it was smaller. He tried to rub his eyes, but even that felt strange. And his feet weren&#39;t hitting the edge of the couch anymore. It was like his whole body was smaller. After a few more seconds he regained his vision. Looking forward, he saw his pants and boxers bunched up by the edge of the couch and off his body. Did he struggle that much? Eric moved up to get off the couch, but his feet couldn&#39;t touch the floor. &quot;Jesus, what is wrong with...&quot; But before he could finish the sentence, he was hit with a terrifying sight. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Staring right at him was no longer a well toned sixteen year old with a dick that could impress any girl, but a scrawny little kid with a tiny penis. His fumbling had gotten it erect, but even then it was only a measly three inches long. He scanned his body, which was also the same. &quot;No way! No way! This is not fucking possible!&quot; Eric cursed, which coming out a young boy&#39;s mouth, looked silly. He got up completely and stood tall, but he was barely bigger than the TV screen. &quot;My body! My precious body!&quot; Eric picked up his cell phone and looked at the screen. The same message was shown, but the timer read 0 seconds. &quot;This is the pipsqueak&#39;s fault! I&#39;m gonna fucking kill him!&quot; Eric picked up his wife beater which he laid on top of the couch and placed it carefully on his body. It could fall off at any moment, but it would do. It covered his embarrassingly tiny dick at least.<br />
<br />
Which brought him to here. &quot;When I change back to normal, that pipsqueak will fucking pay!&quot; Eric said to himself. &quot;I&#39;ll make my own wish. Maybe I&#39;ll make him a baby? Yeah. That would be good.&quot; As evil thoughts filled Eric&#39;s head, Jason said something that would shake his very soul. &quot;Hmm? That&#39;s strange...&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s the app. It&#39;s gone!&quot; &quot;Wh-What do you mean it&#39;s gone?!&quot; &quot;I mean its gone! Like it never existed!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t fucking play with me. It definitely exists. My cell says...&quot; But when Eric looked at his phone, he was dumbfounded. The message was gone. &quot;What the fuck is this?!&quot; He ran towards Jason. His movements made the wife beater fall to the floor, but he didn&#39;t care. &quot;Eric! You&#39;re naked!&quot; &quot;Shut up!&quot; Eric grabbed the phone from his hands and looked at it. &quot;No way...&quot; It was true. The app itself was nowhere to be seen. He tried his best to find it, but it wasn&#39;t even in Jason&#39;s download history. It was like it never even existed. &quot;You&#39;ve have to be fucking kidding me! This is a dream, right?!&quot; He pinched his cheeks and even grabbed his balls, but to no avail. &quot;Eric... Little kids shouldn&#39;t play with themselves.&quot; &quot;You piece of shit! Do you have any idea who you&#39;re talking too?!&quot; &quot;Yep. My little brother Eric.&quot; Jason got up in front of Eric as a sign of superiority. Eric shrunk back. &quot;What did I just do?!&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;Don&#39;t think you can...&quot; Eric tried to assert his dominance, but Jason pushed him down and pinned him to the ground. &quot;I did think Little Brother. And with no way of turning you back anymore, it looks like a new set of rules are gonna be in place from now on... pipsqueak!&quot;</p>
