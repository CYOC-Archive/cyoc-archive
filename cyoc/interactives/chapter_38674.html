<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Tricia wished Sam hadn't woken her up so soon. She was really enjoying using her friend as a pillow. Her skunk form had the unexpected benefit of being cuddly soft.
<P>It seemed only natural, then, that Sam should become even more comfortable to snuggle with. Trish called up the animal menu on the remote.
<P>Before she could locate the animal she had in mind, she suddenly felt an insatiable urge to eat pickles dipped in peanut butter.
<P>"Hey Sam, it's gonna take me a minute to program this thing. Do you mind getting me a jar of pickles and a jar of peanut butter?"
<P>Sam looked at her strangely.
<P>"Please? I have another one of those cravings." Sam looked nervous for some reason. "What's wrong?"
<P>"Um...nothing," Sam said. "I'll be right back." With that, she trudged off to the kitchen.
<P>That was odd. Sam shouldn't have looked surprised by her order. She'd been eating stranger and stranger things since she had gotten pregnant four months ago. Pickles and peanut butter were one of her less unusual snacks.
<P>Putting it out of her mind, she continued to work on the settings for Sam's upcoming change. She needed to be more cuddly than a skunk. A nice woolly sheep coat would be a welcome upgrade. She thought for a moment about reversing Sam's weight gain, but her large paunch and lightly padded figure contributed to her life-sized stuffed animal feel. Trish decided to merely stop all future weight gain and keep Sam vaguely plump.
<P>Sam returned with the jars of mismatched food, and set them on the coffee table. Trish glanced at the light fold of fat oozing over her waistline and realized that Sam's paunch was just as big as her own five-month womb now. Funny she hadn't noticed that before. She looked down at her belly, which was sticking out enough for three inches of white-furred stomach to show below her shirt.
<P>"Thanks, 'sis,'" Trish said. "Though I think we won't have to worry about being sisters any longer."
<P>"What's going to happen now?" Sam asked with dread.
<P>"Well see, my kits and I enjoy a good snuggle buddy. We'd like it if you fit the bill more appropriately." Without further discussion, Trish zapped Sam.
<P>"Ack!" Sam jumped back, her belly and breasts wobbling. "A little warning, please?" She began to itch all over. Looking down at herself, she saw that all of her black fur was turning white and growing out. Her small claws were thickening and her fingers began to go numb. She tried scratching at her itchy arms, but her hands grew more and more stiff. Her fingers were overtaken by the growing claws, gaining a hoof-like appearance. The fur was curling up all over her body, with the exception of her forearms and lower legs, which were mostly bare. Her upper arms, thighs, and body were gaining a thick coat of what looked to be snow white wool.
<P>"A sheep? You're turning me into a she-e-e-ep?" She clapped a semi-hoofed hand over her mouth. "My-y-y vo-o-o-ice!"
<P>Her straight white hair curled severely, looking indistinguishable from the wool. Her skunk ears grew longer and longer until they flopped down into her woolly mane. Her tail shriveled up into a stubby white nub at the base of her spine, sticking out cutely from her overstuffed pants. Her fingers now numbered only eight; her thumbs having disappeared. Her two outer fingers on each hand were shrunken to 1/3 of their size, while the middle ones had thickened and hardened to resemble longer versions of cloven hooves. She tried to flex the digits, but they only wobbled pathetically.
<P>Her clothes were being puffed to extremes by the fluffy wool. It almost looked like they were shrinking. In fact, she quickly realized, they were shrinking. Her top was shifting into a thin piece of material that barely covered her bra. The bra itself had grown a bit so as to be not uncomfortable as it strained to hold her larger and fluffier breasts. Meanwhile, her pants had disappeared and her panties grew into a bikini bottom that was almost totally engulfed by her wool and fat. Her socks had also disappeared, revealing a pair of unmistakable sheep hooves.
<P>Trish squealed. Sam looked over to her friend, whose belly was coming along nicely. She should only have been 6 months pregnant at this point, but it looked like she was ready to give birth to twins. The white fur of her belly was clearly visible as a lump the radius of a basketball pushed her shirt up quite a ways.
<P>"You look adorable!" Trish chimed. She dropped the remote safely onto the couch cushions and tackled Sam with a big hug. Her pregnant belly and Sam's woolly paunch squished together uncomfortably.
<P>"I-I-I'm no-o-o-t a-a-amu-u-u-sed," the new sheep-girl protested. "Wha-a-a-at's wi-i-i-i-ith ma-a-a-a-a-i-i-i-i-i--?" Sam choked as she fought back the disturbing bleating that wanted to come out of her throat.
<P>"'Your voice?'" Trish finished. "I thought it'd be cute."
<P>"I-i-it's no-o-o-ot." Of all the changes she had to endure that day, Sam hated the voice the most. At least if she was five hundred pounds she could still communicate. Now she'd have to start putting things in the simplest terms possible or risk more ridiculous bleating.
<P>"When my kits arrive in a few weeks, we'll have to change you back to this so they can share the snuggles."
<P>Trish continued to press herself against Sam's silky wool. She nuzzled her skunkish nose into her puffy shoulder. It felt nice, at least, to share an embrace as soft as this. Sam hugged her friend back as best as she could. She could feel Tricia's belly grow and press harder and harder against her stomach. Might as well go along with it for the moment, she thought. Trish would undoubtedly change her into something else eventually.</p>
