<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>So about a year or two ago, I did the &quot;Elsewhere in Town&quot; option of the previous chapter. Even back then, I knew it wasn&#39;t going to be good. So now, I figured I&#39;d redo it completely. If you would like to contribute, please do so! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the SWAT team tried their best to contain the virus before it got to the rest of the town, a 16 year old boy named Jake was walking in the opposite direction of all the action. He was currently on his way to his friend Kyle’s apartment to spend the weekend since both of Kyle’s parents were out of town. He had his duffle bag full of clothing and other essentials for the week slung around his shoulder and neck. With his right hand, he scratched an itch on his head full of brown hair. <br />
<br />
As Jake walked down the street towards Kyle’s apartment building, he didn’t hear the sound of heavy footsteps thumping as they hit the ground until someone pushed him out of the way. Jake fell to the ground and glared at the person who had pushed him out of the way. <br />
<br />
“Hey! Watch it man!” Jake said angrily, getting the attention of the person. They stopped and turned around to face him, and Jake’s eyes widened. First of all, the man, if you could call him that anymore, was completely naked and sprouting a massive erection. He was covered head to toe in fur with a small puffy tail above his ass. His ears were on the top of his head and still growing into rabbit ears, while his feet were growing larger. <br />
<br />
“W-What the fuck?!” Jake shouted, backing away from the strange rabbit man. The anthropomorphic rabbit took a step towards him, his nose twitching ever so slightly, before he quickly turned around and ran down the block before running into the same apartment building that he was heading for. <br />
<br />
Jake shakely got up, trying to comprehend what the hell just happened. Some strange rabbit man sprouting a massive erection just pushed him out of the way, and he was disturbed and incredibly disgusted by every last bit of it. <br />
<br />
“Kyle might get a kick out of this,” Jake said to himself as he got up and walking into the apartment building that Kyle lived in. As he walked into the lobby of the apartment, he couldn’t help but chuckle at the shocked look on the face of the receptionist. <br />
<br />
“You see that creep too?” Jake asked. The woman only nodded, the shocked look still on her face, before she went into the door that was behind her, closing it behind her. <br />
<br />
Jake ignored it and made his way to the stairs, walking up a few flights of stairs until he reached the 3rd floor. Opening the door, he stepped into the hallway and walked until he found Apartment 325. Standing in front of the door, Jake knocked 3 times. From the other side of the door, Jake heard another male voice yell, “The door’s unlocked! Come on in Jake!” <br />
<br />
Jake twisted the doorknob and opened the door, closing it behind him when he was inside. <br />
<br />
“That you man?” Kyle yelled. “I’m in the living room. Lock the door behind you so no one else can come in!”<br />
<br />
“No problem bro,” Jake called back, turning to lock the door behind him before he walked down the small hallway before the room opened up into the living room and kitchen. Sitting on the couch watching TV was Jake’s best friend Kyle. He was wearing a blue tank top that exposed his broad shoulders and well defined biceps, as well as a pair of khaki shorts. He propped his feet up on the coffee table. His blond hair was shaggy and unkempt, like it always was. Kyle was a natural girl magnet, which made Jake a little jealous. <br />
<br />
Kyle turned away from the TV and looked at Jake with a grin on his face. “You finally got here dude!” he chuckled. “Never takes you this long to get here.” <br />
<br />
“You’ll never believe what happened,” Jake said, kicking off his flip-flops and throwing his bag to the side before sitting down on the couch and propping his feet up like Kyle. “So I was walking down the street, when I get pushed out of the way by this naked anthropomorphic rabbit thing. It was sprouting a massive erection, and it ran into your building.” <br />
<br />
Kyle began laughing, shaking his head in disbelief. “Come on dude, you honestly think that I believe that bullshit?”<br />
<br />
Jake began to laugh with him. “Yeah, I wouldn’t believe me either, but I swear to you that it happened!” <br />
<br />
“Whatever man, lets just watch some TV.” <br />
<br />
The two teenagers turned their attention to the TV, watching what Kyle had been watching before Jake had arrived, which was apparently the ongoing football game over in Seattle. Every now and then, the two teens would turn their attention away from the TV to just talk to one another about what they planned to do now that summer vacation had finally started a few days ago before turning their attention back to the TV. <br />
<br />
Jake was about to ask Kyle what they should have for dinner when he noticed the tent in his friend’s shorts. “Dude, really?!” he complained. “You’ve got a fucking hard-on!” <br />
<br />
Kyle looked down, and his face quickly turned red as he grabbed one of the couch pillows and put it over his erection. <br />
<br />
“You getting a hard on for me or something?” Jake said jokingly. <br />
<br />
“Shut up! I’m not into that gay shit, and you know it!” Kyle snapped back defensively. “Whatever, it’ll go away in a minute or two.” <br />
<br />
Jake rolled his eyes and went back to watching the game, occasionally glancing over at Kyle out of the corner of his eye to see what his friend was doing. Kyle seemed to be awfully fidgety, as he was moving around slightly every now and then.<br />
After nearly five minutes, Jake heard Kyle say, “I can’t take this anymore.” Confused, Jake turned to face Kyle. <br />
<br />
“What do you me-WHAT THE FUCK?!” <br />
<br />
Kyle had pulled down his pants and boxers and begun to mastribate right then and there. He was leaning his head back against the couch, letting out soft moans as he pleasured himself. <br />
<br />
“Dude, stop that! That’s disgusting!” Jake exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“I-I can’t…” Kyle moaned. “I can’t s-stop myself.” As Kyle continued to jack himself off in front of his friend, Jake was completely unaware that he was beginning to get an erection of his own. <br />
<br />
Kyle continued to moan in pure bliss as he began to jack himself off faster and harder. As he did, his moans grew louder. Finally, he threw his head back and moaned as he released his load all over himself and his cock. When he finished, he began to pant heavily. <br />
<br />
“Well...that was something,” Jake said, making Kyle quickly turn his head to face his friend. Kyle proceeded to take off his tank top, revealing his well defined six pack. <br />
<br />
“Jake…” he moaned. “S-Something’s not right…” <br />
<br />
Jake looked at his friend with a look of disgust on his face after what had just happened, but the look of disgust quickly changed to a look of shock as he pointed to Kyle’s feet. “Dude! Your feet!” Jake shouted, getting Kyle to look down at his feet.<br />
<br />
Kyle’s feet were no longer human. They had grown somewhat larger and thicker and had become covered in light tan covered fur. His toes had changed into strange digits as his toenails had lengthened into sharp claws. <br />
<br />
Kyle shook his head in disbelief. “No...no no no no no! This can’t be happening to me!” He then quickly turned to Jake and said, “You have to get out of here! NOW!” <br />
<br />
“Why?! What the fuck is happening to you?!” <br />
<br />
“I-It’s some diseases called the Fur Fever...I think…” Kyle said as the fur spread up his legs. “It’s a virus that turns anyone it infects into some kind of anthropomorphic animal. Once they’re transformed, the victim can only think about sex. They’ll fuck anyone they want to and spread the disease.”<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck no!” Jake yelled. “I-I&#39;ve gotta get out of here!” He started to get up off the couch, but Kyle grabbed his right arm. Jake turned to look at Kyle, and he watched as his best friend’s look of panic began to turn into a look of enjoyment. <br />
<br />
“P-Please...don’t leave…” Kyle groaned. “D-Don’t leave me here...without someone to fuck!” <br />
<br />
Jake watched in horror as Kyle’s muscular body was covered in fur. A thin tail covered in fur grew out of his tailbone, and a ruff of brown fur appeared at the end. The teen moaned in pleasure as his cock began to grow longer and thicker. A sheath began to grow in until it completely engulfed his cock. After a few seconds, a tipped cock head began to emerge from the sheath as little barbs grew in on the side of the cock. <br />
<br />
Kyle’s abs were covered in fur, as were his shoulders and arms. His fingernails lengthened into sharp claws like his toenails did. As the fur grew up his neck and face, Jake watched in horror as Kyle leaned his head back and moaned in pure ecstasy as his teeth sharpened and his face pushed out into a rounded feline muzzle. His eyes turned into those of a feline as Kyle’s ears became round and moved to the top of his head. Kyle’s blonde hair darkened and grew down the sides of his head and the back of his head. The fur on the back of his head converged on his back at a point while the fur that grew down the sides of his head surrounded the front of his neck before moving converging together and stopping right where his heart was. <br />
<br />
The new anthropomorphic lion let out a loud roar before looking at Jake with a horny grin. <br />
<br />
“K-Kyle…a-are you still….in t-there?” Jake stuttered. <br />
<br />
“I’m still here dude,” Kyle said, licking his muzzle. “And I’m going to enjoy turning you.”</p>
