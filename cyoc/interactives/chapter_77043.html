<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The book was interesting, Ethan had to give it that, however he wasn't really sure if he believed it could do what the woman had said. But, as an ordinary fourteen-year old he was always looking for something to spice up his life. He was athletic, sure, though it was mostly an effect of him trying to make excitement in his life.<br />
<br />
So he quickly showered and brushed his teeth, briefly gazing over himself in the mirror; an athletic build, short brown hair and brown eyes, before returning to his room to get dressed, throwing on boxers, jeans and a t-shirt. It was Saturday, so he didn't have to go to school, and as he trotted downstairs he heard the TV blaring which meant his brother was awake.<br />
<br />
His younger brother Gabe was ten, and like himself had brown hair and brown eyes, and was largely just as athletic. He was currently dressed in his pyjama pants and shirt and watching Young Justice while texting or something on his phone. A typical 21st century boy. Their parents were still asleep, trying to sleep in as much as possible.<br />
<br />
In a flash of a sudden idea Ethan remembered the book, and dashed upstairs to grab it. He still wanted to test it, and he wanted to make sure it was something big so that he could be sure it worked. He also was kind of nervous of using himself as a subject, so he figured Gabe wouldn't mind. Besides, worst case scenario was the book simply wouldn't work, and best case was Gabe became some fantasy creature, which was something he was something he showed a specific interest in.<br />
<br />
Ethan trotted back downstairs once again, this time holding the book. When he got to the opening to the living room he threw it open and looked to the spell he wanted. Then he pointed at Gabe, thought of the creature he wanted to change him into and then said the command words &quot;Divine Shift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately two things happened. The first was he felt an incredible fatigue come over him, like he'd just run a marathon five times in a row. It was so tiring in fact that he could barely stand, and he slumped to the ground panting. The second thing that happened was he saw Gabe undergoing his transformation. His brother had also heard him drop to the ground and was about halfway over as the transformation truly kicked in. Unfortunately Ethan's fatigue kicked in first and he closed his eyes in exhaustion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother?&quot; whispered a voice, cutting through the darkness.<br />
<br />
Ethan's eyes shot open as he realized he'd actually dozed off. He was on his back actually, lying on the couch. Standing next to him, and looking concerned, was Gabe. Except it was Gabe like he'd never seen him. While he was still obviously his brother, much had changed from the spell. Where Gabe had once had brown hair, it was now platinum blond, and looked incredibly soft. His eyes, formerly brown, were now clear blue like a summer sky. His skin was fair, but in a creamy, healthy way, and it didn't possess a single mole, blemish or freckle.<br />
<br />
Gabe's build hadn't changed much, he was still athletic, so somewhat slimmer and more evenly toned than before, making his muscles look smooth and soft, yet clearly strong. And Ethan could see a lot of his brother's body as he now wore a clean white exomis instead of his normal clothes, and bore gold bracers on his wrists and ankles, but nothing else. And of course, most obviously, a set of six magnificent white wings extended from his brother's back, and a smaller pair jutted up vertically from just above his ears.<br />
<br />
As Ethan sat up he noticed other aspects of his brother. For example Gabe had always been a fairly cute kid, but the smooth, fair shape of his face and features was now downright gorgeous to behold. And he seemed to glow faintly, giving off a gentle light. &quot;Brother! I'm glad to see you're alright,&quot; Gabe said, speaking with a gentle, sweet and slightly formal tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I'm fine... did you just call me 'brother'?&quot; Ethan asked with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? Oh, yes, it appears to be an aspect of this new form your book granted me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled at his brother's sudden shock, a smile that was just as sweet and fair as the rest of him. &quot;How?&quot; stuttered Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a seraph, one of the mightiest beings of the Light,&quot; replied Gabe, &quot;I would not be much of one if I could not read my brother's mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
It seemed the change had done some considerable changes to Gabe's mind. And as Ethan gazed on him he could feel the power that his younger brother now possessed and knew that he was a much greater being than himself now. &quot;So Gabe,&quot; Ethan began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabriel,&quot; replied his brother, &quot;If it wouldn't be too much trouble, could you use my full name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, sure. So Gabriel, what's it like being an angel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is amazing brother,&quot; the boy said, rising up into the air slightly without the slightest effort, &quot;I was able to carry you to this couch with such ease you might as well have been a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Ethan replied simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and here brother, take this,&quot; said Gabriel, handing the Book of Myth to him, &quot;That is an incredibly powerful book, and it should be treated with care. And don't do something as reckless as a Divine Shift again until you are able to handle it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the all-powerful angel, why don't you hang onto it,&quot; replied Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it was entrusted to you, not me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan shrugged and took the book and looked up at his brother. The exomis he wore really didn't hide much of his form. It covered a little of his left pec and most of his flat, toned stomach, and his thighs, though it was open on one side and the entirety of his leg could be seen depending on his movement. And Gabriel didn't seem the least bit concerned, even though he wouldn't be caught dead in such clothes when he was a human. &quot;But Gabriel, what should we tell mother and father, er, I mean mom and dad?&quot; asked Ethan suddenly.<br />
<br />
Gabriel giggled at his brother's use of his formal terms and landed lightly once again. &quot;I would not like to lie,&quot; the seraph said, &quot;However I can disguise my form for now. It depends on whether or not you are willing to divulge the existence of the book to our parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;</p>
