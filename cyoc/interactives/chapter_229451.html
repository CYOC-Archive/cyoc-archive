<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack&#39;s heart was pounding as he stuffed the mascot-turned-suit away, into his backpack, and quickly ran out of the staff room before he was noticed by anyone. As he snuck back into the crowd his thoughts finally caught up with him. He can&#39;t believe he just did that, the zipper actually worked!<br />
<br />
With the new suit in his bag, he didn&#39;t want to waste more time wandering the zoo, he wanted to get home and try it on! As soon as he was out the front gate he practically ran back to his apartment, after making sure no one saw what he did. He was so excited he nearly forgot to lock his own front door. But he was finally alone, and he couldn&#39;t wait a second longer. His hand dove into his backpack and pulled the suit out as the other tossed the bag onto his couch.<br />
<br />
Now with a chance to finally get a good look at it he held it in his hands and just ran his fingers over it, admiring the soft faux fur and the beautiful black spots dotting it. If he wasn&#39;t the one who put the zipper on her in the first place, he would never have known that suit used to be a person, especially when he looked into those fake, empty eyes or that warm stitched on smile...it just made him shiver in anticipation for what he was about to do next.<br />
Setting the suit down as he started undressing rather hastily. A shirt flung off to one corner of the room, pants to another, and he practically tore his underwear off with how excited he was. &quot;There we go, all ready~&quot;, huffing softly with a building arousal. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror hanging on the door, and honestly, he was looking pretty good. His eyes took in his own form, admiring how his tan skin shined softly in the light beaming through his window. The pair of well-defined and muscled legs supporting that bubbly ass. Not to mention a toned core. And he wasn&#39;t quite lacking in the chest department either sporting chiseled pecs.<br />
<br />
But that was enough self-admiration, now was time to suit up! Jack turned back to the couch and picked up the already open suit, holding it in his hands as he stared into its soft insides. He felt that nervous energy returning as he slipped one of his arms in, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this, it&#39;s so soft......&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh god it felt incredible it was like it was made to fit him perfectly, the way the fabric just hugged his whole arm in a pillow like embrace. His other arm wasn&#39;t far behind either in finding its way in. With a bit of maneuvering around his legs weren&#39;t outside for much longer either, sliding right on in leaving only his head exposed. The fact he was still hard only worked up his excitement more, especially considering how the tight fabric was constantly rubbing against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one more piece, oh man...&quot;, he held the head in hands ready to put it on. He stared into the hole for a moment holding his breath before he took the plunge, shoving the head over his own. He didn&#39;t have words to describe what it felt like having such a soft fabric hugging and rubbing over his entire body at once, how it fit so perfectly around his entire body. It was dark for a few moments as he just stood there reveling in the feeling of the suit before he reached back for the final part. It was a little hard grabbing the zipper, the paws of the suit weren&#39;t as big as a regular mascot suit, but they were still chubby enough to be a little clumsy and unwieldy. After a few tries he finally managed to get a grip and pull it up, closing the suit with him in it.<br />
<br />
The changes set in almost instantly the moment he finished zipping up the suit. Everything suddenly got a lot brighter as his eyes started adjusting to seeing from the eyes of the suit. “I feel so, soft. Am I…?”, his hands pressed against his new fur as he pushed down to try and feel himself under it. It was like he was touching his own skin but pressing down he couldn’t feel his regular body at all.<br />
<br />
He snapped back to the mirror to take in his new form, his paws starting to rub over every inch of his furry body. The first thing he noticed was how his little friend was completely gone, it was just all smooth fur down there now though it did still feel kind of sensitive…but there were still other things to poke and prod!<br />
<br />
Aside from his smooth crotch and bouncy tail swishing happily behind him, the biggest change was his entire head. No matter how much he squeezes, pressed, or squished he couldn’t feel anything but a leopard skull inside. He couldn’t really say that was a bad thing at all. Jack clearly seemed to be enjoying himself, anyone would be able to tell just by looking at that big grin plastered on his muzzle. Though he should probably start going by &quot;she&quot; now.<br />
<br />
There was no trace of a human ever being in there and honestly that was the hottest thing ever to her being turned into this. She just fell back onto the couch as she keeps squeezing herself. Her D-cup breasts bouncing. She thought on what she should do next, the night was still young after all……</p>
