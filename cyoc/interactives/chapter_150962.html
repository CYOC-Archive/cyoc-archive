<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">t pulled his jockstrap off.  Carefully, he drew the outlines in black marker. Then he began to fill in his work with black and colored markers.  Ryan wasn&#39;t sure which design Horst had decided on.  He just knew that after each marking, Horst would take a break while that color dried.  It seemed to go on forever.  At last Horst seemed satisfied with his work. Then he took an aerosol can and sprayed Ryan - er, Horst&#39;s lucky jockstrap.  He let it dry, and sprayed another coat.  Waited again, and then a final coat.  He hung Ryan on his bedpost and went to bed.<br />
<br />
The next day, Ryan was shaken roughly awake as Horst pulled him on. Ryan yelled, cursed, screamed.  He had dreamed he was human, but was horribly reminded as Horst&#39;s junk filled him with Horst&#39;s morning wood that Ryan was now Horst&#39;s jockstrap.  Ryan was furious that Horst had permanently marked him. He only hoped that the markings wouldn&#39;t translate to tattoos when Vinnie changed him back.<br />
<br />
Horst wore Ryan non-stop for the next few weeks.  At first Ryan yelled incessantly and fruitlessly at deaf Horst.  The worst part was that Horst seemed to forget that Ryan was Ryan, and behaved as if Ryan was just a jockstrap.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I like the new design on your jockstrap,&quot; Carter said on Tuesday, &quot;I bet Ryan will like it too.  Do you think Vinnie has changed him back yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Horst shrugged, and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know if Ryan will like it, but I bet if he does maybe I can convince him to get the design tattooed on him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right? Ryan hates the idea of being tattooed.  You know Stacy tried to get him to - wait here comes Vinnie,&quot; Carter said.<br />
<br />
Vinnie walked up to them, and said softly, &quot;I&#39;ve tried everything, but Ryan won&#39;t turn back.  I guess I need to study more. But I promise one way or another I will make Ryan human again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he went to change for his phys ed class.  Horst and Carter joined him on the field where the coach had them do calisthenics before running laps.  Ryan was soaked with Horst&#39;s sweat, and was horrified when Horst skipped showering, and dressed in his street clothes while wearing damp Ryan. This went on for days, weeks.  Vinnie wasn&#39;t aware that Ryan was Horst&#39;s jockstrap, and finally, Ryan gave up speaking at all.  He was trapped in his own personal silence.  He began to look forward to Horst&#39;s morning wood, and subsequent jerk off.  Horst at least started showering while wearing Ryan, and that cut down on the ripeness. After six weeks, Ryan forgot that he&#39;d ever been human. <br />
<br />
Then one afternoon, Vinnie told Horst and Carter to meet him after lunch behind the bleachers.  He set the jockstrap he believed was Ryan down on the grass, and took out a large crystal.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I borrowed this from my grandmama, she said that if I focused on it, it could break any transformation spell, but that I should be careful because it wouldn&#39;t just change Ryan back, but change any other transformed person in a mile area back into themselves too.  I thought you&#39;d like to be here, when I use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will it be instantaneous or slow?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I dunno. Could be either I guess?  Well, here goes nothing,&quot; Vinnie said raising the stone.  It was a crystal that reflected and refracted the sunlight. As Vinnie held it, it started to glow internally, and it glowed brighter.  The jockstrap on the ground lay still and inert, but Horst suddenly felt the jockstrap he was wearing heat up.  Then it started to get puffy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, damn, I shouldn&#39;t have eaten all those burritos for lunch,&quot; Horst said, then bending over the jockstrap, he added, &quot;Ryan, don&#39;t change until I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
He darted into the nearest men&#39;s room.  In the stall he took Ryan off.  He grinned the fabric was now like fleshtone leather, and the marker designs had become tattoos.  He flushed pulled his shorts on, and forced his swelling jockstrap through the gap under the janitor&#39;s closet door.  Then he rejoined Vinnie and Carter.<br />
<br />
&quot;He should be changing back, I can feel the energy, but nothing&#39;s happening,&quot; Vinnie complained as sweat dripped from his brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s just slow.  Leave him there, and maybe by the end of the day he will change back?&quot; Horst suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe you grabbed the wrong jockstrap? Maybe Ryan&#39;s been in the locker room lost and found bin this whole time? Or in his locker?  Maybe that&#39;s now Ryan?&quot; Carter suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that might explain why he got silent, but I kept him with me all the time.  Well, most of the time,&quot; Vinnie said, &quot;Well, if he&#39;s anywhere within a mile of this school, this crystal should make him change back.  Even if he&#39;s in the lost and found bin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if someone is wearing him now?  Coach makes anyone without a jockstrap get one from the lost bin,&quot; Horst said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I imagine anyone wearing him will want to take him off pretty quickly,&quot; Vinnie said.  The rock glowed white, and then dimmed.  &quot;The spell breaker is cast.  It&#39;s only a matter of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horst headed to the locker room with Carter to check the lost and found bin.  Horst retrieved the spare strap that he had marked to match Ryan&#39;s design, and using the need to use the toilet again, &quot;Damn burritos&quot; he changed into it.  He added a pair of XL sweat pants and sweat shirt that he had stowed in the back of his locker along with Ryan&#39;s shoes into his gym bag.  Carter had ransacked the lost and found bin, but not found Ryan.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We better get to class,&quot; Horst said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Vinnie said he&#39;d change back, so he&#39;ll change back, but he&#39;s been a jockstrap for weeks, it may take hours for him to become human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It took a second for him to change from human to jockstrap remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Horst shrugged, &quot;See you later, I&#39;m going to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horst did go to class, and managed to wrangle a hall pass due to the burritos he had for lunch.  He had looked like he was about to explode before the teacher acquiesced to give him the pass.  He headed straight back to the bathroom where he had slid Ryan under the door of the janitor&#39;s closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, lucky jockstrap, use your hand and open the door,&quot; Horst shouted through the door.  He wasn&#39;t sure if Ryan had changed back, but Vinnie seemed confident, so he figured he had.  He didn&#39;t want to call it Ryan yet, he had to make sure it knew it belonged to Horst.  He grinned, as the knob began to turn.  As soon as the door opened a crack, Horst pushed it the rest of the way, and stepped inside with his gym bag. He flicked on the light switch.  Ryan had been standing in the dark for at least an hour, Horst figured, maybe longer. <br />
<br />
Ryan was perfect.  He had a dull, nearly mindless expression on his face that had been on the pouch of Horst&#39;s jockstrap for the past two weeks. He was as handsome and muscular as ever.  One thigh read &quot;Property of&quot;, and the other thigh read &quot;HORST&quot;. The black, red and yellow flames on either side of the words continued up from the thighs up Ryan&#39;s torso to his armpits, similar flame markings were on his shoulders and upper arms.  It was fewer markings than most of the drawings, but it produced stunning results as tattooed flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who owns you?&quot; Horst asked running a finger down one thigh underlining &quot;Property of&quot;, and then the other thigh, &quot;HORST&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ryan dropped to his knees, and pulled down Horst&#39;s pants.  He stared in confusion at the jockstrap with the flames drawn on it. He opened his mouth, and wrapped his arms around Horst&#39;s waist and sobbed in a cracking voice, &quot;Wear me, Horst!&quot;<br />
<br />
Horst grinned and popped a boner, he pulled his pouch down to free his cock, and asked, &quot;Ryan, I bet you&#39;re hungry?&quot;</p>
