<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This package will open a transdimensional door to a virtual space. There you will meet the avatars of other people who are also currently utilizing the White Room package. Those avatars will showcase traits and skills they have, which you desire. In your White Room, as it is personalized to you, you will be able to talk to and interact with the avatars of the individuals and you may choose to accept any trait or skill you encounter, or move on, waiting for another version of it to appear.<br />
<br />
Upon accepting this package, you will be scanned your traits will be made available to others while you are in the White Room.<br />
<br />
This feature requires internet access and any alterations WILL NOT change reality by default. Upon returning you will be offered the option to change reality for any individual traits you may have taken. You may change your mind and discard traits you accepted while you remain in the White Room, but after exiting those traits will be your own and you must use the Chronivac to remove them.<br />
<br />
Jeff clicked accept and the package downloaded and installed almost instantly, and the install button changed to &quot;Apply&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated, &quot;this whole program is weird&quot; he thought, but intriguing. Clicking the apply button there was a flash and he saw the room, no the world, dim... Looking outside through his window everything was losing color and the world was closing in... As he stared the buildings and trees in the distance seemed to become grayscale and then meld into a gray background fading from view. As he continued to watch this continued to happen up until the tree only 40 feet from his window faded from existence and Jeff began to become less interested and more panicked. He turned to notice a light emanating from his closet door. <br />
<br />
Very curious and very scared he opened the door knowing better than to expect his clothes. A bright light welcomed him and he shielded his eyes as he stepped in. <br />
<br />
As Jeff opened his eyes he realized he was in a sitting position,  before him was a small steel sign with something like a QR code on it... As he stared it seemed to move and he somehow understood it to mean, &quot;Welcome to the White Room! You may browse at your leisure, time in your dimension is halted. Searching is possible through voice commands, simply say SEARCH and then what you are wanting up to 3 words. Also, to exit, simply turn around with your hand in the air. If you don&#39;t have a hand or cannot raise it, stare at the ground. If neck and arm mobility is limited, whistle or yell while looking behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked around and noticed booths there were squares with black borders on the ground for as far as he could see. Jeff looked down to see he was sitting on a white couch. Cautiously he stood up and the couch and sign disappeared.<br />
<br />
He made his way to the nearest black square, as he drew near he could smell a familiar smell. He approached it and cautiously said, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey Jeff, gimme a second.&quot; came a mans voice from somewhere in the 25ish foot square.  A second later out popped a head from under an invisible something... the man stood up standing a few inches taller than Jeff and looking to be in his early thirties. &quot;Hey, sorry bout that, was just in the middle of giving this beauty an oil change.&quot; he gestured to the invisible vehicle he was apparently under. &quot;Hey, can I get you anything? Let me grab you a beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was taken aback, this random man was treating Jeff like an old friend and he was too young to drink. The man turned to an invisible fridge pulling something out. Jeff heard clinking. the man then went to an invisible counter and made the motion of picking something up and a motion of removing a bottle top twice. A few seconds later he was extending his reach to the line, offering something to Jeff, Jeff reached out feeling a cold bottle. Grabbing it, he pulled his hand back. A beer bottle was in his hands, on it was a qr code like symbol, this one said, &quot;Basic vehicle knowledge granting capacity to complete oil changes and basic car maintenance on a variety of vehicles.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man gregariously held his bottle up and said &quot;Cheers!&quot; as Jeff was deciphering the symbol, &quot;You gonna leave me hanging?&quot; the man asked. Jeff awkwardly reached back out past the black line, both hearing and feeling the bottles making contact, the bottle vanished as it passed the line and re-appeared as it came back. The stranger smiled and took a swig, Jeff mimicked him tasting the bitter cold liquid go down his throat, as it hit his stomach he felt distant for a minute and suddenly had an idea of what the man would be doing under the vehicle...&quot;Oh&quot; Jeff exclaimed with sudden realization of how this place worked.<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s expression changed suddenly, &quot;Hey I&#39;m logging off now. If you discard that trait, it may not be available again when I or you return. consider your options carefully.&quot;  The entire square, and the man within it, went black, and then disappeared. looking around there were several missing squares in the local area, apparently he had a few skills or traits Jeff would have wanted... Jeff was still holding the beer and took another sip, terminology surrounding vehicles slowly went from vague concepts to concrete ideas, to hands on experience as though he had been maintaining his own cars since he was 16,,, wait... he is 16.<br />
<br />
With his beer in hand, Jeff meandered over to the next area, mindful that the person offering this trait may log out at any time and become unavailable.</p>
