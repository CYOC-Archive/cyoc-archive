<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not all elderly people that became Animalians were Human at first. One had been born a tiger, and specifically a rare White Tiger. Raj was a very old Tiger, around thirty years old with a birth date in 1994. Though, unlike India&#39;s wild tigers, Raj had been born and raised in the New Delhi Zoo and was always a prized specimen. Much of it came from his white coat with thin blackish brown stripes but was often prized for his brilliant ice blue eyes rather than the greenish-yellow eyes that normal tigers had. This drew people to the exhibit he was in throughout his life, and he lived a very healthy life as both his parents were unrelated White Tigers, though they had been caught in the wild and brought to the zoo after raiding villages for their livestock. This kept Raj strong and drew more attention, particularly after his parents died of old age.<br />
<br />
Much of this now came from his age. For tigers generally didn&#39;t live that long. Wild tigers typically died of old age, disease, or parasites within a 15-year period, assuming they weren&#39;t fatally injured in a fight with another tiger or one of the large prey animals they hunted. Tigers in zoos and under good treatment lived longer, but they also only lived to be around 20 years or so. This was something that had mad Raj&#39;s age something of a surprise and miracle given that he was now pushing thirty. The Queen of Ranthambore, Machli, had caught a lot of attention for her own lengthy lifespan and living to reach around 20 years before she died in 2016, a feat that was impressive given that Machli was a wild tigress and spent all her life facing the struggles that any wild tiger faced, though her fame and photogenic nature had likely helped prolong her life as park guards and local natives had supposedly been feeding her in her later years.<br />
<br />
Raj had now outlived the legendary wild tigress by ten years, and that age was beginning to show. The muscle that had always been there as he moved about his enclosure and tested against devices that were designed to test his strength had been atrophying. The zoo&#39;s vets were detecting signs things that would be comparable various ailments commonly seen among elderly Humans. A lot had been done for Raj over the years, and that was marked as part of why he had lived for as long as he had, well in excess of what was to be expected for even a captive tiger raised and cared for by people. It had brought added attention to Raj, though, now, his age was catching up with him and a manager for the feline wing of the New Delhi Zoo found herself not wanting to see Raj die, even though she also knew that Raj had set records for how long a tiger could live. Thus, as things progressed, Raj was carted up and trucked to Village of Grass Fields, India&#39;s resident Animalian Colony.<br />
<br />
&quot;You almost seem smitten with him, madam,&quot; said one of the forest guards at the colony &quot;city&quot; as they rolled the semi-conscious Raj on a trolly to one of the lab rooms in the hospital that had been built there.<br />
<br />
The woman, Aadhya Rasad, looked to the two Tiger Animalians that were with them. They were impressive and strong, and from reports and stories that she&#39;d heard on the Village of Grass Fields, their work had done a lot for wildlife conservation in the region and protecting the economic interests of the village, regardless of its very regal look to it. And in connection with the workers at Horizon, there were also reports that they had also served to cut the number of Rabies cases among mundane animals in the region by more than two thirds, some of this had come from access to medicine and vaccine distribution systems that could be scattered into the jungle and help vaccinate animals against the virus. They&#39;d also caught a poacher that had been trying to kill leopards in the region as well. That was all good for the Animalian Colony city. Now, she could only hope the scientists could do similar work for Raj.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got my start with the New Delhi Zoo in the feline wing when he was young,&quot; Aadhya answered, noting that Raj was occasionally lifting his head, though while still strapped to the trolly he was on to make sure he didn&#39;t move. The mundane tiger gave a few small grunts that almost sounded like he was chuffing to her, but Aadhya figured that was mostly just Raj grunting at his old age, &quot;and while I was never allowed to work as a direct keeper with him... I was in the area, and I could talk with his main keepers and thus also talk to him. He was relatively calm for a tiger. He didn&#39;t like his shots, but he never attacked anyone and didn&#39;t cause any problems with the female tigers we bred him with over the years. In some ways... I suppose... as I climbed the ranks within that ring of the zoo, Raj became something of a friend. Particularly when I had trouble in dealing with abusive men and not finding any real personal peace... He was someone I could talk to and not be judged for my frustration. Now... now it feels like my best friend is dying and I can&#39;t let him go...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good you care,&quot; one of the two forest guards spoke, &quot;though, also keep in mind that once he&#39;s uplifted... he may not want to stay at the zoo or in the area. Many of the dogs that were uplifted here, while they still live and work in the village... they aren&#39;t entirely living the exact life they lived before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Aadhya nodded, &quot;but at least knowing he&#39;ll be alive will be enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
They moved along until they came to one of the larger lab room areas. As they arrived, they were greeted by another Animalian, who presently was wearing a pair of grey slacks and the button-down white undershirt. By the brown fur, hooved feet, and large rack of antlers, this scientist was also a Sambar Deer Animalian. The Deer Animalian looked at Raj and then to Aadhya, who continued to look to Raj and showed her concern pretty obviously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you, ma&#39;am,&quot; the Sambar Deer Animalian said calmly, &quot;He&#39;ll be quite fine. I myself was much older before I converted when this colony was established a couple of years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aadhya nodded and stood aside as two Tiger Animalians pushed the trolly that Raj was strapped to with the Sambar Deer Animalian following along behind him. She was left alone outside, and she found herself pacing with a lot of nervous energy as things were to progress with Raj. She hadn&#39;t been a direct caretaker for him, but she still felt close to him and cared greatly for his future. It wasn&#39;t long before the door opened and the two guards and the Sambar Deer Animalian came out again. Aadhya thought she heard some heavy moans coming from the inside and that made her worry about Raj.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he fine?&quot; Aadhya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe grump at getting a shot,&quot; one of the two forest guards spoke, &quot;but he&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sounds you hear are likely part of what is pretty common with the uplifting process... or conversion process, if one is Human,&quot; the Sambar Deer Animalian said, &quot;and it&#39;d also be something that&#39;s there regardless of age, though, in Raj&#39;s case... becoming young again may add to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aadhya blinked and then looked at the two Tiger Animalians in Forest Guard uniforms and then to the Sambar Deer Animalian again. All of them nodded. She then accepted that and resumed pacing, which only earned a few chuckles from the two Tiger Animalians. Aadhya didn&#39;t care about that. She really didn&#39;t know them. She did know Raj and wanted him to be happy and healthy and didn&#39;t want to lose one who had essentially been a good friend, despite their different species. After a few moments, there came a knocking on the door from the inside. It alerted Aadhya and the Sambar Deer Animalian who had stood by through this process. Aadhya noted that the two Tiger Animalians had rolled the trolly away and likely were returning to their own work and left her with the Sambar Deer Animalian. She also noted that the Sambar Deer Animalian was also holding a set of folded clothes that were of some shade of white and looked to be of a soft material that wouldn&#39;t absorb heat. Of course, a bellowing call soon came through the door as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;AADHYA, ARE YOU THERE? ARE YOU OKAY, MY FRIEND?&quot; came a deep male voice from inside the room.<br />
<br />
Aadhya strangely felt her heart flutter at the mention of her being a friend and that Raj knew her by name. Part of her expected this as uplifted Animalians often seemed to know a lot about Humans and certain aspects of Human society based on what they had observed before their uplifting. The things the new Animalians didn&#39;t always know were often due to how limited the contact and available information had been for the new Animalian before their uplifting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; Aadhya spoke through the door, &quot;and I&#39;m fine... the doctor and I are going to come in. Can you step back from the door?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES,&quot; came Raj&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
The Sambar Deer Animalian was the one to open the door and entered first, but Aadhya followed close behind. They found Raj standing in a relatively open room. He had become a magnificent male White Tiger Animalian. He regained all the muscle that old age had atrophied, and Aadhya felt he looked even a bit buffer than the two Tiger Animalians that had been there to provide security while Raj was brought into the facility. Raj&#39;s stance was a little bit shaky, but this was also likely because he was getting used to standing on two feet, something that was unnatural for a mundane tiger. She also noted that he had a hand hovering down to his waist and likely covering his reproductive equipment, which fit in with many of the description of things that uplifted Animalians learned in the process of their uplifting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good, Raj,&quot; Aadhya spoke with a friendly smile, &quot;the doctor here has some clothes for you... they should fit a strong Tiger Animalian such as yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalian?&quot; Raj asked as Aadhya looked away to a side wall while the Sambar Deer Animalian offered Raj the clothing was carrying.<br />
<br />
&quot;A community of anthropomorphic Animals that got their start in 2016,&quot; the Sambar Deer Animalian spoke as Raj managed to put one leg through the leg of the pants that were offered to him, &quot;you&#39;re presently in Village of Grass Fields, India&#39;s present colony city. Most of us here used to be Human but accepted the conversion for better health and medical access that came with the establishment of the colony. And it was also in part why Ms. Rasad. You were reaching the likely end of your life and after befriending you, even while you were a mundane tiger, she didn&#39;t want you to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could accept passing on,&quot; Raj commented solemnly, &quot;Aadhya and the keepers took good care for me and I wanted for nothing... and to a degree, it was good to see people smile when they saw me at the zoo... But... Aadhya always seemed nervous in the past few years. And now... it leaves me wondering if she was okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want you to die, Raj,&quot; Aadhya spoke, turning to see Raj pulling the shirt down and his ears flipping back up erect as his head fit through the shirt&#39;s opening for his head, &quot;call me selfish if you will... but I liked being able to talk to you, even if I wasn&#39;t one of your keepers. It gave me comfort and let me get things off my chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the men who beat you in your previous relationships?&quot; Raj asked, his voice full of concern, &quot;I will not let them harm you, my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Raj,&quot; Aadhya answered, &quot;it is good to see you well again... and hopefully we can stay in contact...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t stay?&quot; Raj asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still have my work, and you&#39;ll likely have some adjustment classes to being an Animalian... and the village here can handle that,&quot; Aadhya told him, &quot;And then you&#39;d be free to pick your own path. And I&#39;ve heard that the government has even wanted to expand the idea for another colony... one that&#39;s actually getting some international funding from India, Burma, the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan... It&#39;ll be on one of India&#39;s islands in the Indian Ocean between the main part of the country and Burma. You could explore there too... once you&#39;ve caught up. And from time to time, I could visit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aadhya looked down for a moment and soon found herself being pulled into a strong but gentle hug. She looked up to see Raj&#39;s blue eyes looking down on her. He chuffed softly and nuzzled his nose to her check.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like that... to have you visit,&quot; Raj said to her, &quot;and maybe more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before any sort of living arrangements are made,&quot; the Sambar Deer Animalian spoke, &quot;we will need to give you your vaccinations, Raj. To keep you healthy and to assure that there are not unintended spreading of the Animalia Virus. Now... you showed you didn&#39;t like shots with the uplifting, but I assure you, they will do you no harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raj nodded while Aadhya enjoyed the hug and felt her heart flutter a little, though, she didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
