<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was strange for Kim to lie down on the bed knowing that the boyfriend of her greatest enemy was only a few feet away lying on his own bed. She was always on edge when she roomed with Lisa because she never knew what she would do to her while she slept, she didn’t know what Thomas would do to her. She was finally about to close her eyes and let sleep take her when she heard a sound coming from his side of the room. She froze wondering what he was planning, what was he doing when she heard it again the sniffling and soft shaking. She knew what was happening and slowly she got out of bed, her bare feet touching the titled floor as she walked over and looked down at Thomas who was curled up in the fetal position shaking like a frighten child as he was crying. She had never seen anyone like this before, well beside herself that was. <br />
“Thomas.” Whispered Kim her voice taking on a musical tone as Thomas froze. “It’s alright, you want to talk?”<br />
“I don’t think talking will help me.” Said Thomas his voice soft “I have been disowned by my family, dumped by my girlfriend and I am becoming a monster. What will talking do?”<br />
“Well at least one of those three isn’t too bad.” Countered Kim as she stood in the darkness by Thomas’s bed. “You may not have seen it until now but Lisa is a bitch, your better off without her.”<br />
“Really…you want me to smile and be happy because you think my ex girlfriend is a bitch?” countered Thomas as he rolled over and glared at her with tears in his eyes. <br />
“Happy, no.” agreed Kim “I never had a boyfriend so I don’t know how it feels to be dumped but I have dealt with years of pain by Lisa and her friends, and a little by you and your friends so I know what type of person she is.”<br />
“Lisa did nothing to you….” Started Thomas as Kim’s eyes narrowed as her fist tightened to the point that her fists where turning white in rage. <br />
“Nothing…” whispered Kim her musical voice taking on a lot of venom. “Are you blind or just stupid? Did you not see all the times she would knock my books out my hands? Did you not see how she would rip into me for my cloths, for my looks, for anything she found upsetting that day? Did you not see the times she tripped me, the times she physically abused me and so many countless things? Did you see them or not?”<br />
Thomas paused for a moment before looking down at his feet in shame.<br />
“I thought so, so do not tell me that being with that bitch is a down side.” Stated Kim “You may be upset about becoming a monster, I get that and if your family can’t support you through this then they are not really family in the true sense but maybe this is the best thing that happened to you, or me.”<br />
“What do you mean?” inquired Thomas <br />
“Because you finally see what people are really like and you can find real friends.” Stated Kim as she let out a sigh. “Maybe I am being too harsh, but my point remains. Besides you can’t change it, I can’t change it you need to just handle it the best you can. Now we both need or sleep, so please get some sleep.”<br />
“Alright.” Confirmed Thomas as he rolled back over and tried to get some sleep.<br />
Sleep actually came fast for Kim, since the change took a lot out of her. She awoke to find Thomas still asleep and that was for the best as she stood up and looked at herself in the mirror. She had grown in height yet again and her hair was now down to her shoulder blades, those where minor compared to the real changes. Her face was more elegant, her lips fuller, her eyes bigger it seemed, her neck longer. She was taller, she would bet she was nearly 5’11 or maybe 6 foot and her breasts had gone up at least a single cup size but where firm even without a bra and her heart shaped ass was nearly perfect. She ran her hands down her size, her hands where thin and elegant yet strong, her core was also thin but tone as well. <br />
“Wow…” said Kim her voice musical as she looked at herself in the mirror again, she would say she looked somewhat like a cross between a super model and professional athletic. According to what she knew aside from getting her powers this was basically her new body, tomorrow only her eyes and hair would change to match her new power set. She was clearly a walking Goddess and every men&#39;s wet dream and she liked it.<br />
“MY GOD!!!” yelled Thomas at the top of his lungs as Kim turned and looked at Thomas’s bed.</p>
