<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Billy stood up to his father, who got up to throw Billy out of his personal space---devoted to watching sports and growing his gut in privacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not that great!  You suck as a father!  And now you're gonna get it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy's father, Rocky, laughed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What're you gonna do?  Huh?  What're you gonna do, BOY?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that film we saw a while ago?  Vice Versa?  Well get ready for the real thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
The room seemed to fade away.  Smoke and golden-brown lights swirled everywhere.  Billy seemed to rise and his trouser legs soon became trapped against his legs as they rose above his ankles and started to bunch at his knees.  Rocky could barely make out the room because everything was so dark. Billy's face looked up at his father, who was starting to sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?  What's going ooooon?!&quot; Rocky screamed over the din of the lights whooshing around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that's just the magic..taking effect!&quot; Billy said, his last words cracking.  &quot;How's it feel to be--&quot; Billy continued, his voice then dropping several octaves: &quot;to not have any control over the situation?&quot;  It dropped another octave.  &quot;In fact, I'd say you were pretty much done as far the control over this place goes...I'm gonna call the shots from now on, DAD.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rocky had been trying to move but couldn't.  Billy grew up before his eyes, the little child's head expanding.  His jaw became squared, his face broadened, his forehead grew, his hair became more crisp and less light...he looked before like such a pipsqueak.  He could easily look like a freshman in high school to anyone who didn't know any better.  His son put a hand up to touch his flat, chestnut hair.  The light glimmered around him and when next he could see clearly, his pants fell off completely, and he shrunk below his son's neckline.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  This isn't happening!&quot; he said, in an early teenagery voice that belied his manhood.<br />
<br />
Billy felt himself grow taller, his thin blue shirt stretching until the fabric broke.  He felt himself in pain, but didn't move as the magic wouldn't allow it.  Hair sprouted all over his body, beginning with his legs and armits, and then swishing around the borderline of his shorts and crawling quickly upwards to fill in the chest areas Rocky could see through the tears in the shirt.  Billy constricted his thin arm and felt it pump up with energy.  Rapturous pain shot through him, like he was being injected with a needle as all of the cells grew intensely in his arm, thickening it with intensity.  It felt like liquid stone was being poured in to solidify around his bones!<br />
<br />
He moaned and the moan was deep, different, alien, wonderful.  His face was now fully adult and with a final touch his boyhood face disappeared under the full armor of thick-plastered stubble, forming an coat of brown-grey all over his face.  The lights faded and subsided, and a shaking Rocky stood under the shadow of Billy, who put his hands on his hips and stared down.  His shaggy mane made him look like a young Kurt Russell, or Aaron Eckhart (the guy from Possession) with enormous pecks that weighed over him like a bulletproof vest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now do you believe me?  Magic does exist and now I'M in charge!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't!  How is it possible?!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you worry your little head over it, Rocky,&quot; said Billy taking off his shirt and feeling his chest hair with affected surprise and delight for the first time.  &quot;I'm sure no one will miss you down at the construction site, and I know more than enough from watching you on how to fake my way into a job there...I know there'll be an opening.  And Earl is always lookin' out for a big strong guy with nice thick arms.  All the guys at school even joke about that place...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a queer farm...you...you...you're just a child!  How do you think you'll pull this off!  Don't you think that anyone will think it weird that two different people are now living here?  What about our family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of our relatives live far away and out of state and the neighbors never pay attention to anything.  Sides, I have the deed to the house.  It's in my name now, along with everything else here.  Check YOUR driver's liscence if you don't believe me.&quot;  Billy grinned.  He'd been prepped on the full effects of the magic.<br />
<br />
Rocky turned through his massive shirt and coat and shirking them off until he was in just his A-shirt that covered him down to his knees, leafed through the contents of his wallet and saw his now grown up son plastered throughout its contents.  Nothing was in his name.  Billy snatched it from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I better put some of your clothes on...well, they're mine now, son,&quot; said Billy scratching his chest.  &quot;Man, how do you adults deal with being so hairy?  It's so weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a ring at the doorbell.  Billy greeted in his new friends and introduced him to his diminuitive father.  Billy lounged over to the couch and put his feet up on a desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's how it's gonna work, dad.  These two know what they're doing, and they've done it before.  Now that you're my age, and I'm yours, you gotta do what I say, and if you don't you'll be thought of as crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the crazy one!&quot; little Rocky screamed.  Billy stood up, frowning.  Rocky backed up, fear coursing through him for the first time in he couldn't remember when.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like that attitude.  And who's gonna believe you?&quot;  He picked Billy up and held him over his shoulder, and carried him into what would be Rocky's &quot;New&quot; room.  &quot;Now you get some of your new clothes on, and we'll take you to the cub scouts meeting later.  If you're a good little boy, which you better start acting like...you...you are such a geek!&quot; Billy said, laughing.  &quot;Man, are you ever sorry you picked on me!  Man, this is gonna be awesome!  I'm an adult! I'm an adult!  I'm an adult!&quot;  he said, jumping up and down like a little kid.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...easy there, guy,&quot; said Kirk, with a smile.  &quot;We kinda have to act like, older and junk.  You know, cause we're all men now.&quot;  Kirk beamed.  This was going to be great!  Kirk's new lover slid his arms over Kirk's abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what say we take the runt out, already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am an adult, and I am YOUR father!&quot; shouted little Rocky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Former.  Father,&quot; replied Billy.  &quot;I'm the father now, cause I'm a way better father than you are, so nnnnh!&quot; and stuck out his tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's mature!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you are, but what am I!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A big dope, that's wh--&quot; but Rocky didn't finish that sentence as he was hoisted into the air and held above Billy's non-grinning head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get used to it!  You lost!  And there's like, no way back and stuff.  I'M the big one.  YOU'RE the small one.&quot; Billy put Rocky down.  &quot;Big vs. small.  You're the runt, but I'll be okay.  Just learn your place.  I'll be back, I'm just gonna throw on some new clothes and maybe uh...some cologne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you could defintely use a shave,&quot; added Kirk's lover, still amourously nuzzling Kirk's neck.  <br />
<br />
Billy felt his face and got his first, and sudden, erection.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Swee-ee-eet!&quot; he said, and ran to the bathroom to get started.<br />
<br />
After shaving, showering, and putting on some manly scented cologne, Billy walked his father and new friends outside.  Kirk drove back to his house to collect his kid-father and introduced the two.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You could use a friend dad, at least I thought...&quot; and Kirk laughed it up with his new friends.  The drive over to Cub Scouts would include a bunch of &quot;real&quot; kids and their dads.  Billy was wearing a shirt of his dad's that clasped his chest nicely and showed off his torso.  The pants were business type, formal.  They made him feel grown up.  The coat had been a little big for him, but he could have it adjusted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hop on out, sport,&quot; he said when they got there.  Rocky was apparently not happy with the arrangement.  Billy shook his hair and put an arm over his dad's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know, this could be the beginning of a great friendship...for me.  All you need to do is get used to things...&quot; Billy said, with unfamiliar confidence and suaveness.  &quot;I mean, things come, they go...just go with the flow, dad, and everything will be all right again.  Now you have fun, I'll be joining a bunch of the other dad's over at the bar across the street!&quot;  And then Billy high fived Kirk.  Their new kids went sullenly towards their new childhood pursuit.  <br />
<br />
Billy, once his dad was out of sight, began to saunter towards some new fun...</p>
