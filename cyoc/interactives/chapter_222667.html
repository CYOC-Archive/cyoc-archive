<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle finished drying himself, using two towels to do the job, and almost turning him on again, he was able to finish without another round of masturbatory fucking, he turned on the vent fan in the bathroom and walked out into the hall.<br />
<br />
“Kyle! Come out here!” Kyle froze, it was his mom, what was she doing home now. <br />
<br />
“I&#39;m can&#39;t, I&#39;m naked right now.” Kyle responded<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t care, I know what happened with the curse!”<br />
<br />
“HOW?” Kyle shouted. He hear a sigh. “Just come out here and let me see you. It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ve seen those legs before.” Kyle reluctantly walked down the hall, completely naked, standing there in the kitchen was his mom, arms crossed, she looked him up and down, pinched her nose bridge with two fingers and sighed. “God Damn it Kyle. I thought you&#39;d be better than this.” She looked up. “Well no use in being upset now, go get some clothes on, and lets talk about it.” <br />
<br />
Kyle nervously went to his room and started putting on underwear for all seven of his legs, he somehow figured out how to dress his male legs in between all the rest of them. As he dressed his mom leaned with her back against the wall in the hallway. <br />
<br />
“So, you aren&#39;t the first person to have the curse in this family. But to make a preppy bitch swap legs, then when she calls you, you decided to punish her in your own pervy little way and you didn&#39;t expect anything bad to happen? Really? Your as dumb as I was!”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you had the curse too?” Kyle said in shock as he pulled shorts on all of his legs.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah.... I actually had it twice. The first time was when I challenged a preppy&#39;s bluff, she turned me into a woman. At first it was awkward, I&#39;m sure this is far worse for you, but I got used to it, I used the curse to seduce her boyfriend, well... fiance into fucking me. He used the curse on her and dared her to use it on me. She was furious with both of us.” She walked into the room, “So, I want to show you something.” She dropped her skirt.<br />
<br />
“Mom... don&#39;t...” Kyle was flustered.<br />
<br />
“Hey, we&#39;re both cursed and pervy, so here.” She dropped her panties, and out flopped the largest cock Kyle had ever seen, it was three feet long, and thick as a baseball bat, the balls were as big as cantaloupes. Kyle gaped, his mom looked amused. “Kyle, I want you to meet your father. This is, or was Ben, the man who sired you. She turned him into my cock, and cursed me with the unfortunate ability to know exactly what the curse did to everyone it ever touched.”<br />
<br />
“Wow... um...” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, where do I hid it? Part of the curse, it fits in any piece of clothing I wear, making it appear as if I&#39;m just a woman. There were positive things, when she figured out that I might be pregnant she made it so I&#39;d always have money, and never have to work.”<br />
<br />
“But I know where..”<br />
<br />
“Do you? What law firm do I work for? Have I ever called you from work? Have you ever heard or seen anything from anywhere that tells you where I get my pay from?”<br />
<br />
“But I&#39;ve seen you file taxes, how?”<br />
<br />
“Ha! The government doesn&#39;t care were your fucking money comes from son! As long as they get what&#39;s theirs they&#39;ll happily let you do whatever as long as it&#39;s not a problem. I made a fake company and reported the cash through that. “But mom!” I hear you ask “Why do we live here?” It&#39;s about keeping things quiet, keep a low profile, you know, no one sniffs around when they think your just a secretary for some business somewhere.”<br />
<br />
“But, where do you go during the day?”<br />
<br />
“Around, I visit coffee shops, chat with lots of people, I&#39;m one of those people that you ask, “What the hell does she do for a living, she always seems to have money.” Now....” She walked over and slapped one of the cloned asses. “Have you fucked yourself yet?” Kyle went pale. “Oh come on. I just told you I was a guy like you, and look at this cock, do you think I don&#39;t play with myself?”<br />
<br />
“Ye... Yeah.” He quietly admitted.<br />
<br />
“Was it good?” She smiled wickedly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Kyle blushed, “It... it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever felt before.”<br />
<br />
“Well these are yours forever now kid, you&#39;ll have plenty of time to masturbate from now on. As for your little friend getting a curse like this, I don&#39;t care for you little freaky friend Jarred, he creeps me out, and that&#39;s saying something right? I suggest you give him his Aunt Tina&#39;s legs, she&#39;s got a massive ass, that&#39;ll give him exactly what he wants.” Kyle looked shocked. “Oh hush,” she put a finger to his lips, “I&#39;ll tell you what, if you want to be naked all weekend we can to that together, you have to get used to having six pairs of my legs after all. And since you now know I don&#39;t work, how about we spend the weekend together, really get to know each other.”<br />
<br />
Ooookay. Um... Mom.”<br />
<br />
“Please, you can call me Diane, after all, with those legs you&#39;re practically my sister now.”<br />
<br />
She left Kyle in his room after getting her cock back into it&#39;s clothing, and went to order a couple of pizzas. Kyle stood there staring in the mirror for a while.<br />
<br />
“Hey! You coming out here honey? The pizza&#39;s almost here!” She called.<br />
<br />
Kyle decided to strip himself from the waist down, it was already awkward for him, he may as well get used to them naked. He walked out and sat down on the love seat, his legs filling in every inch of the sitting space, his front legs presenting themselves like earlier, he adjusted, spreading his back legs, moving his body around until they didn&#39;t look like he was ready to screw himself again.<br />
<br />
“Hey, nice, you really are embracing this aren&#39;t you? How&#39;s it feel to have six sexy asses like that.”<br />
<br />
“Really, really awkward.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, especially because they&#39;re mine yeah? Well don&#39;t you worry, I give you full permission to touch, fondle, fuck, and be fucked by my legs as you want. That&#39;s your body, I know it&#39;s weird but hey, you look hot, it&#39;s kinda turning me on too.” Kyle gaped at this, “Well, I&#39;ve been playing sweet and innocent mommy for what? Sixteen years now, but you and I are alone, if someone else was here, I&#39;d keep up the act, but they&#39;re not, so talk to me like I&#39;m one of the boys. After all, I know you wanted to fuck me as well.”<br />
<br />
Kyle blushed. “You weren&#39;t supposed to know about that.”<br />
<br />
“OH! I WASN&#39;T SUPPOSED TO KNOW?” She laughed loudly “The longing stares, the weird fiction you type on your computer, the fact you have a milf fetish? I should have named you Oedipus at this rate. Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;re both perverts, if she had dared you to seduce me I wouldn&#39;t need to be seduced, mommy dom is a turn on of mine too.”<br />
<br />
“Why are you telling me all of this?” Kyle was getting mad.<br />
<br />
“Because my son, we have both been cursed.” She put a hand on his cheek, and kissed his forehead. “And I know yours is as awkward as mine, imagine hiding an erection that&#39;s three feet long in a skirt and having to act normal when a hot woman trots by. I&#39;d still be able to get a lover, the cock would be freaky but normal to them, but still, I could hurt someone with this bat of mine. I&#39;ll reel it in for you, I know your uncomfortable, but I&#39;m here for you, if you need anything.” She then kissed him on the lips, his eyes went wide and stared into hers as she made her best bedroom eyes at him. “And I mean anything for this weekend, you let me know, if you want to stay home from school for a week, you can do that too. But you&#39;ll have to get back there eventually, no son of mine will grow up to be a slouch.” <br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door, and she went to answer it, leaving Kyle blushing, both cock were rock hard now, and he nearly gave in. She came back with the pizza. “Need some private time?”<br />
<br />
“N...no, I can&#39;t handle that again right now.” <br />
<br />
“Understandable, lets watch a movie.” She pulled one from the shelf, this was going to be an interesting weekend, she thought to herself, her pervy little son finally up and screwed himself, both with the curse and literally, she&#39;d support him through it though, he was after all, her little man.</p>
