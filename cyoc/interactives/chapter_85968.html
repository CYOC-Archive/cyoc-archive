<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to leave the mall.  You had fun, but there&#39;s somebody you&#39;ve been wanting to show your new toy to.  Besides, you can come back to the mall any old time.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a short walk from the mall to your friend, Francis&#39;, house.  You&#39;ve known each other since you were kids.  Sure, you&#39;ve had your rough times now that you&#39;re in high school, but you&#39;re still the best of friends.  You can&#39;t recall any reason for Francis to be mad with you at the moment, so you make your way directly over.  On the way, you debate on how to tell Francis about your magic, age changing remote.  He would never believe you.  You&#39;re going to have so show him, somehow.  Perhaps a direct demonstration is in order.  You feel excited to show Francis your amazingly powerful, as well as amazingly cheap, discovery.<br />
<br />
You arrive at the front door of Francis&#39; house.  You see his dad walk around the corner of the house, carrying a large, black trash bag.  He looks up and smiles at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; you say.  You like Francis&#39; dad.  He&#39;s pretty cool, and lets you two get away with more than he should.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, there,&quot; he says, nodding back at you.  &quot;I didn&#39;t think you were coming around, today.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug.  &quot;Where&#39;s Francis?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Francis&#39; dad pulls a face.  &quot;Grounded.  But you can see him.  He&#39;s in his room.  I swear, you kids and your hormones...&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis has been getting grounded more and more these days, though you never hear why.  You nod a thanks at his dad and head inside.  You&#39;ve been to his house often enough to know exactly where to find Francis in his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Francis is the very picture of boredom.  He&#39;s lying, face down in his bed, head sunken in his pillow.  Various books and magazines are strewn about his room, as if looked through briefly then tossed aside.<br />
<br />
Francis looks up at you, a dour expression on his face.  &quot;What do you want?&quot; he asks.  Francis seems to be in a mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought I&#39;d drop bye and say hi,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Francis plops his face back into his pillow.  &quot;Well, you said it,&quot; you can just make out.  &quot;Now go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pull out the magic remote and start fiddling with the settings.  You see Francis&#39; stats pop up, indicating his current age of 15 years.  Francis is somewhat tall for his age at 5&#39; 10&quot;.  He&#39;s also very slim, though not terribly athletic.  His dark hair has grown somewhat shaggy, and he seems to be attempting to grow some form of facial hair, but all he has managed is a couple hairs on his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; you say, making small talk.  &quot;Don&#39;t have time to talk to your best friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
You set the remote to age Francis at a rate of five years for every minute that passes.  You press the center button to start the process.<br />
<br />
Francis looks up from his pillow again and sighs.  &quot;Sorry.  I&#39;ve just had a rough time, lately.&quot;  He notices your remote.  &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug.  &quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing.  Just something I picked up at the magic shop.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sits up and looks at you quizzically.  &quot;Magic shop?  That&#39;s a remote.  Why would a magic shop sell remotes?&quot;<br />
<br />
You already notice slight changes in Francis.  His hair seems to be growing steadily shaggier.  His feeble attempt at facial hair is improved ever so slightly by the appearance of more little hairs on his chin.  Unfortunately, he seems to be developing some serious acne issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not important,&quot; you say, trying your best to act nonchalant.  &quot;So, what have you been up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis doesn&#39;t seem entirely convince, but he drops it.  &quot;Not much,&quot; he says, his voice cracking slightly.  He clears his throat and continues.  &quot;Just getting grounded.  It was over the dumbest thing, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a seat on the edge of Francis&#39; bed.  &quot;Oh, really?&quot; you say, doing your best to feign interest.  &quot;You don&#39;t say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis starts telling you about his rough day.  Something about his step-mom and how he got into a fight with his dad.  You&#39;re not really paying attention to what he&#39;s saying, though.  You&#39;re more engrossed in his progression.  Francis&#39; hair reaches a peak, shaggy length.  He swipes it out of his eyes at one point, but ignores it otherwise.  He actually develops a decent chin goatee after a minute, a vast improvement over his original attempt.  His acne improves and even vanishes, thankfully.  Francis&#39; features become more mature and he looks like a college student as he reaches twenty.<br />
<br />
As another couple of minutes tick by, his changes continue.  As he passes through his twenties, Francis reaches his peak height.  It&#39;s hard for you to tell what it is by looking at him, as he&#39;s sitting down, but it has to be over six feet, also his shirt and pants don&#39;t seem quite long enough anymore and Francis constantly pulls at them.  It made sense, as Francis&#39; dad is also very tall.  His facial hair fluctuates through several styles, from stubble, to goatee, to goatee and mustache, back to goatee again.  In fact, he seems to have become genetically inclined to grow facial hair, a little surprising as his dad is always clean shaven.  Though, his dad always had a shadow lining his jaw now that you&#39;re thinking about it.  Speaking of hair, you can see a decent amount now covers him arms, ankles, and a trail has appeard on his stomach.  You don&#39;t see any sticking out from his shirt collar, so he isn&#39;t quite that hairy.  Francis&#39; voice has depend as well.  It isn&#39;t by any means baritone, but it&#39;s certainly more of an adult voice, now.  By the time Francis reaches thirty, his shaggy hair suddenly shortens to a more mature short haircut, reminiscent of his father&#39;s.  In fact, Francis is growing up to look more and more like his father with each passing minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Are you even listening to me?&quot; you hear him say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Oh, yeah!  Yeah, I am,&quot; you stutter.  You had been so into his physical transformation, you hadn&#39;t been listening to a single word he&#39;s said.<br />
<br />
Not fooled, Francis glares at you, then puts a hand to his face.  &quot;Listen, dude, if you&#39;re not going to listen to me then just...&quot;  He stops.  His hand moves down to his chin, where he currently has a goatee and mustache.  &quot;What the hell?&quot; he mutters.  He stands up and immediately leaves the room.  You get up and go after him.  You realize you&#39;re smiling, and are having a hard time keeping yourself form giggling like an idiot.<br />
<br />
You get to the bathroom to see Francis, now entering his thirties, staring at himself in the mirror.  His face has matured into that of an adults, but it is still his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy f**k, dude!&quot; he says.  He looks at you then back at the mirror.  &quot;Are you seeing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis had managed to keep his slim build throughout the entire process, but you can see his body slowly beginning to fill out, a slight belly forming under his too small shirt.  His hair also begins to recede at the front, expanding his forehead somewhat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not only seeing it,&quot; you say, holding up your remote.  &quot;I&#39;m controlling it.&quot;  You press the button and stop the changes, setting Francis&#39; age at 35.  You then switch over to the &quot;Clothing&quot; settings and press the button.  Francis&#39; shirt changes into a perfectly sized, long-sleeved, button up flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up, exposing his lightly hairy forearms.  His pants extend to the proper size and width to accommodate his new height and small belly.  Francis also manifests a pair of leather work boots.<br />
<br />
Wow, you think to yourself.  If he didn&#39;t look like his dad, before, he certainly did, now.  Even right down to the slightly receded hairline and small belly.  In fact, if it wasn&#39;t for Francis&#39; goatee, the two were practically interchangeable.<br />
<br />
Francis merely looks at you and your remote, wide-eyed.  &quot;No.  F***king.  Way.&quot;</p>
