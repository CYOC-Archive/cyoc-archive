<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was leading Ling by the hand; Ling stared straight at the ground.<br />
<br />
Ling had felt a sense of nervousness - and even some shame - that she had never felt before - at least, as far as she knew. Her thoughts were racing.<br />
<br />
“How could I not be nervous? It’s the Queen! The most beautiful and most perfect horse herm there ever has been and ever will be!” She thought to herself, following closely behind Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted as Jennifer brought her into an apartment building. The doorman was just that - a man - and he ignored the two, trying not to make eye contact as Jennifer led Ling into an elevator.<br />
<br />
Jennifer pressed the button for the penthouse. As the elevator whirred up, Ling took note of how wonderful Jennifer smelled, the horsey scent intoxicating. However, Ling didn’t feel herself become aroused, a confusing development that she chalked up to nervousness.<br />
<br />
Finally, the elevator opened up to the 20th floor, with Jennifer leading Ling to her apartment and up to two chairs. She looked around; the apartment was neat, but she noticed herself framed on the wall and felt a sense of both pride and embarrassment. <br />
<br />
“I’m quite a fan of yours. Take a seat.” Jennifer said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Ling was a bit surprised; she didn’t think mistress had ever thought of someone as lowly as her. She sat down, it now dawning on her that she’d been silent the whole time. “Um... thank you.” She squeeked out. She was a porn star! She was never nervous! What was the matter with her?<br />
<br />
“Of course, Ling. Now, I’d like to talk to you about something.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“Of course, anything!” Ling said, hoping to please Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Jennifer suddenly leaned over and kissed Ling, who happily kissed back. As Jennifer broke the kiss, however, Ling’s head started to hurt.<br />
<br />
Memories filled her head. Memories of being flat chested; of being a prude; hating horse herms, and most importantly, being human.<br />
<br />
“What... what is this?” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“Those are your old memories.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Ling asked her. As far as she knew, she’d been a horse herm her entire life, hadn’t she? But... she couldn’t remember anything before the age of 18. That was normal, though, wasn’t it?<br />
<br />
“Where do you think horse herms come from, Ling?” Jennifer asked politely.<br />
<br />
“From... from other horse herms, of course!” Ling said confidently.<br />
<br />
“Well, yes, they do. But how do they come about? We can’t get pregnant.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“I... I... I don’t know. Where... where did I come from?” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“You see, Ling, being a horse herm is contagious. We change people with our milk and our cum. However, once you were changed, a new method came about. Your porn changes people.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“So... so my other memories...” Ling started.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Those are your ‘real’ memories.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“Oh... oh my God. Why am I not freaking out? I’m... why...” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, Ling.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
Ling immediately felt her tension disappear.<br />
<br />
“I’m... I’m sorry if I interfered.” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“No... quite the opposite. The reason I’ve brought you here isn’t to shame you. You’ve boosted my power to an incredible level. I love that about you. You’re incredible, Ling. The real you - the horse herm you.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“I’m... incredible?” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“I want you to join my royal council. I plan to have a team of princesses to rule under me, and I want you to be the first. You can keep doing your porn, of course.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“This... too much... I... I’m not a horse herm? We change people? I change people?” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Maybe I didn’t give you all your memories back.” Jennifer said, getting up from the chair and walking over to Ling, kissing her again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, all of it came back. Her old, prudish life. Her transformation. Caroline. The horsecock cafe. Now, though, Ling knew of the origin her species. How Jennifer and the curse came to be. Even how reality altered and gave Jennifer this beautiful apartment.<br />
<br />
“Woah... I...” Ling started.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay. You’re okay.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“I... am! I am okay. I... shouldn’t I want to go back to my old life? But... I feel so free now. I want to serve you, mistress! I should be scared... but I’m not! Oh, this is so much better.” Ling said, a huge smile on her face, finally feeling her cock harden once again.<br />
<br />
“Being one of us truly is wonderful, isn’t it?” Jennifer said, her own cock rising.<br />
<br />
“Mistress... your curse freed me, even if it did change me so much. I... thank you... please, make me one of your advisors, my queen. I want to spread this gift even more than I already am! Let’s take over the world, my queen!” Ling said. Ling didn’t even realize that she was calling Jennifer mistress out of her own volition - she had full control of her mind. *She* wanted this, not Jennifer. She stood up out of the chair.<br />
<br />
Jennifer kissed Ling again, even more passionately this time, grabbing Ling’s cock and giving it a couple strokes. Ling had never cum this quickly in her life. Jennifer took her hand, covered in Ling’s cum, and licked it clean, never taking her eyes off of Ling’s.<br />
<br />
Ling instantly came, spraying milk and cum everywhere. She was even more sure of herself now; she wanted to be a horse herm forever.<br />
<br />
“So, you wanna stick around? I was afraid you’d wanna leave, but I figured I owed you the option since you gave me such a wonderful gift. I was able to take the power of your porn and apply it to quite a few people, including my family. You see, I didn’t really feel like fucking them in their old states. I’m not quite that depraved.” Jennifer explained, now sitting in one of the chairs.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad I could help. And yes, I would like to stick around. I don’t think I could ever go back to my other life, especially knowing that I’d miss out on this beautiful one.” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? I originally thought about just bringing you over here and making you my princess without restoring your memories, but I felt a bit bad doing that. My power is quite immense; I could send you to another, normal dimension where you’d never have to see another horse herm again, and life a normal, quaint life.” Jennifer offered.<br />
<br />
“I’d rather die.” Ling said definitively. “I was so boring. My new life is a thousand times better! I’ll stay here, and live to serve you, my queen. I love you... Jennifer.” Ling said, a sultry look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm. There are those beautiful eyes that captivate so many of us. You’re perfect at pornography, Ling.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, my queen. How does this process work? Will I lose my memories again?” Ling said.<br />
<br />
“No. Well, I haven’t, but I also didn’t get a whole rewrite either. I only recently gave myself the memories of this new reality, and I’ve honestly started accepting them as fact. So... they won’t disappear, but...” Jennifer started.<br />
<br />
“I’ll like my horsey backstory more.” Ling said, licking her lips.<br />
<br />
“Exactly.” Jennifer said. “Now, you know I can change anything about you if you desire, right? Anything at all. And I’m willing to do so, both for myself and you.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“Well...” Ling started.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, I think I know.” Jennifer said confidently.<br />
<br />
Jennifer snapped her fingers. Ling felt a bit of vertigo; she now remembered that mistress had brought her on to the council as “Princess of Pornography,” making her even more famous as a result, when she was 19. She also remembered talking about it in her interview; however, unlike before, Ling knew exactly what Jennifer had done and remembered the old reality. <br />
<br />
“Ah. Sorry, I just wanted to be sure I knew what you wanted. I used my powers to read your mind for a second. I figured I’d bring you on to the council after I confirmed you truly wanted to do so. Now, I’ll change your body like you wanted.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
Ling simply smiled as she felt the changes wash over her.<br />
<br />
Ling’s face shifted slightly, becoming even more beautiful; her lips puffed up slightly, her nose shrunk a bit, her makeup became a bit heavier, adding to the overall slutty look.<br />
<br />
Instead of her holes constantly being stretched out, Ling felt a wonderful sensation as her horsey vagina and asshole became much more elastic, closing slightly and firming up but still able to take as much horsedick as she wanted.<br />
<br />
Ling’s breasts grew once again, becoming massive L cups, as they firmed up greatly, the titanic tits defying gravity just as a porn star’s should.<br />
<br />
She felt a similar change occurring with her ass, it too firming up and becoming a bit bigger, her hips widening once again.<br />
<br />
Ling felt immense pleasure as this occurred, cumming once again and bringing her to her knees.<br />
<br />
“There we go, isn’t that better?” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“Yes, mistress, oh it’s so much better!” Ling said. She looked up; her queen’s hard cock was right in front of her face, a smile on Jennifer’s face.<br />
<br />
Ling immediately began sucking. Jennifer quickly began face fucking the Asian porn star, pumping in and out, which Ling took easily. Eventually, Jennifer came - hard - which Ling swallowed. Ling came at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit... that was wonderful...” Jennifer said, panting.<br />
<br />
“Did... did I do well, my queen?” Ling asked.<br />
<br />
“Did you do well? You did fantastically! I knew I made the right choice! And you’re such a hot fucking slut, too, even before you had me change you. I don’t think I need to change anything else about you. Oh, I love you, Ling. I might even take you as my wife if you keep it up.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
Ling beamed happily. She felt so incredibly accomplished! Her queen loved her! Marriage? To the queen? Ling felt like she was on cloud nine.<br />
<br />
“I... I love you too, mistress!” Ling shouted out.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s great to hear, Ling! Call me Jennifer. Now, you can stay for a while if you want. I’ve... I’ve been pretty lonely since this whole thing started... and it’s nice to know someone else understands...” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
Ling noticed a bit of sheepishness in Jennifer, a side no one else knew. She and Jennifer walked over to the living room, cuddling on her couch.</p>
