<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, you can all go. It doesn’t affect you unless you want to watch me gain the power, I doubt it will be very interesting,” October said,<br />
“I’d like the watch...” Kelvin said. Everyone faced him, “what? I’m new to this whole magic thing, I wanna make the most of it, even if it is boring,”<br />
“Ugh, I’m not walking home alone,” Chelsea said,<br />
“I’ll walk with you,” Yuri responded,<br />
“That’s the same as walking home alone, except you will drive me crazy,”<br />
“Thanks, Chel,” Yuri said,<br />
“I’m joking... mostly. We walk home every day from school together and I haven’t murdered you yet,”<br />
“Yeah,” Yuri said, “October?”<br />
“Yes, Yuri?” October said, she looked anxious as to whether this would work or not,<br />
“Can we have a look around inside your house?”<br />
“Yes, sure. Just don’t go upstairs, and be as quiet as possible,”<br />
“Cool!” She said delighted. She grabbed Chelsea’s hand and dragged her inside. Chelsea gave a look to Kelvin, signalling him to not take too long.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” October said to herself, “okay... okay...” she said again, reassuring herself that this would work, “okay... three... two...” she counted herself down, but before she reached one, she walk forward, stepping inside the triangle. She had her eyes closed, bracing for any kind of weird feeling or other. But nothing. She felt nothing. She opened one eye, then the other. She looked around. She was definitely in the right spot. She frowned, she held her hand out and produced a ball of fire.<br />
Kelvin jumped as she did this, but was smirking involuntarily.<br />
He ball of fire didn’t look special, the same ball of fire she practiced with her father many years ago. She looked fairly grumpy. She stepped out of the triangle. A thought hit her, she wanted to check the book, just to make sure she hadn’t missed anything, to make sure the spell worked, and if it didn’t, if she could somehow fix it. She quickly rushed back into the house and up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Kelvin was still standing outside. His smirk was dying down, but he couldn’t help it. He was obsessed with magic when he was younger, and it seemed that that obsession still hadn’t quite gone away. He wanted to feel what magic felt like. He knew it wouldn’t work, but he wanted to know what it felt like. He walked a little closer to the triangle. He couldn’t feel anything yet, so he reached his arm closer, close enough to feel the magic but not close enough to actually touch it. But still nothing, he couldn’t feel it. He was so desperate to feel the magic that he stood right next to it. Nothing still.<br />
He couldn’t leave this house without feeling what magic felt like, he closed his eyes and stepped into the triangle.<br />
He felt something. It felt like a noise, not the vibrations, but somehow it felt like how something sounded. And it felt like the noise of water, sand, air. Like nature, almost. He stepped out of the triangle with a smile on his face. Beyond satisfied.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t this room give you the creeps? Every time we go in here I expect to just see a skeleton,”<br />
“Chelsea!” Yuri said, “I think it’s cool. October might have weird stuff like this, but you have to admit, it’s cooler than anything you own,”<br />
“Well-”<br />
“Admit it!” Yuri said, looking right at Chelsea,<br />
“Yeah...” she admitted defeat, “it’s kinda disappointing how October is literally a witch and we’re just... she calls us mortal... right?”<br />
“Yep. I like being a mortal, less pressure on being the best witch ever,”<br />
“Yeah I agree. What’s that old show with the witch girl with the boyfriend who’s mortal?”<br />
“Oh I know what you’re talking about, with the black cat?”<br />
“Yeah, that one,”<br />
“Ha... speaking of boyfriend,” Yuri said, she looked over at Chelsea, who’s eyes were wide open and cheeks were bright red. She quickly turned so Yuri couldn’t see her face, “come on, Chel. I think it’s cool! I haven’t dated anyone in like 3 months, and this is your first boyfriend since like... years ago,”<br />
“Y-yeah... I mean... I am quite proud of it,” Chelsea said, she pulled a chair out from underneath a table and sat herself down, “he is really sweet and likes a lot of things I do. And study sessions actually consist of us studying!” As she was talking, Yuri made her way over to Chelsea, she pulled out the chair next to her and sat herself down, the chair was facing backwards and she sat with her face to the back of it, still looking at Chelsea, “and I mean... it’s not... always studying...”<br />
“Chel!” Yuri said with a higher pitch tone, excited, she lightly nudged Chelsea in the arm. Chelsea smiled at this, “wow! I’m proud of you for it, he’s definitely cute,”<br />
“What about you?” Chelsea asked, “weren’t you talking to Victoria?”<br />
“Yeah I was... but she’s not... the sharpest tool in the box,” they both laughed together. They sat together in the quiet for a moment before suddenly the silence was broken. Chelsea’s stomach began to rumble, she looked down,<br />
“Damn,” she said, “I thought I had something to eat before I got here,”<br />
Yuri was looking down with her hand on her stomach, she felt it rumble as well, “yeah I didn’t feel hungry before I got here, and I thirsty too,”<br />
“Yeah... me too... I feel a weird urge to either eat or drink something... but that something...”<br />
“Has to be...” Chelsea added to Yuri’s sentence,<br />
“Those...” Yuri finished the sentence. They were both looking at two items on the very table they were sitting at.<br />
A perfect looking Apple,<br />
And a Gray Coloured Drink.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
October made her way up the stairs and into her room. She quickly flipped open the book and took out the bookmark saving her page. She read the page once more, but this time she read all of it. And she found something she missed the first time, <br />
‘The spell may take anywhere between five minutes and one hour to start working.’<br />
“Oh thank god,” October said to herself, “so it could start working...” she asked herself, quickly turning her wrist over and looking at her watch, “now!” She said loudly, realising she should keep it down to not wake her parents. She made her way back downstairs as quietly as possible. Whereupon she is greeted by a smiling Kelvin,<br />
“What’re you smirking at?” She asks,<br />
“Nothing. Just in a generally good mood,”<br />
“Huh...” she said,<br />
“So where’s Chelsea... and... Yuki?”<br />
“Yuri,”<br />
“Oh. Got it. Where are they?”<br />
“I’m not sure, I can’t sense them in here...”<br />
“You can sense people,”<br />
“Uh, yeah. Obviously. And I told them not to go upstairs, so they can only be in my basement,” October said, she waved her hand, a small red mist covered her hand. Another mirrored red mist appeared by a bookshelf in the wall, she pulled her hand and the mist pulled a book. The bookcase swung open.<br />
“Woah,” Kelvin said, his face had gone from a large grin to a look of surprise, and was slowly developing back into an excited grin.<br />
<br />
October made her way over to the door and began walking down the stairs. Kelvin, without hesitation, followed her. Hoping to find more magical things he could try out. They walked down the stairs until they reached the bottom. October was in front of Kelvin, she stopped, turned around and said to him, “if you feel any urges or temptations down here, let me know. I put a couple curses in this room,” she finished. Kelvin couldn’t help but smile at the fact that a girl he had never met before was saying all this stuff and being absolutely serious.<br />
<br />
As they made their way down the next few steps, Kelvin saw October stop again, but this time she didn’t look at him. Instead she stared straight into the room with a look of confusion, that developed into shock, and finally, a look of,<br />
<br />
“Oh no,”</p>
