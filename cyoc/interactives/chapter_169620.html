<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“9 months ago, I was on a family trip with my entire family and my now ex-girlfriend.” Stated Chris, she didn’t add that he actually proposed on that trip only to have her laugh in her face and admit that she was secretly seeing someone else and was going to break up with him after the trip. Still she should warn her about the chance she could come down with the flu but she also broke her heart so maybe not, no it was right thing to do. “I need to call them to tell them that…”<br />
“Tell them what? That they may have been exposed to the Monster flu 9 months ago and that there is an unproven theory that the virus can remain undetected in the body for that entire time?” inquired Martin sounding a little more of a smart ass then he wanted to. His tone shifted at once as he became more solemn. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have been so harsh but even if it is true it is too late to do anything.”<br />
“Besides, while our family was transformed my mother who lived right across the street from us and was over all the time wasn’t.” added Jenny<br />
“Thank God for that.” Said Martin with a grin as Jenny eyed him with a look that all married couples had. “There isn’t a law saying I have to like my mother-in-law, you don’t like my father. Still there is no one understands this virus.”<br />
“True.” admitted Jenny before looking back at Chris. “There is nothing you can do, you need to focus on yourself at the moment.”  <br />
“Besides, I am sure by now my father has locked my sister’s phone and computer from contacting her along with everyone else.” Stated Chris with a sigh. “I am not sure I could reach them now.”<br />
“Then you need to focus on yourself, you will have a lot to learn over the next couple of days and then settle in within the nearby city.” Said Martin as Chris nodded her head, she had a lot to learn. <br />
The next couple of days where a made mix of learning about her new body and the society she was about to walk into. On the body front, she learned about all the personal hygiene requirements that where different for a women compared to a man, learning how to put in a tampon was weird enough. Then there where stuff like learning how to put on make up and how to care for much longer hair, as a man she had always had short hair so having to brush out her now shoulder blade length blonde hair was different. <br />
That stuff was normal compared to how to take care of her monster parts, she was mostly human but thanks to her new cat like features she had to wash her tail, that was similar to her hair but her ears where very sensitive and extra care had to be put in tending to them. Still it was nothing compared to what others had to go through, there was a man in her counseling sessions who had become a vampire and as such now had to drink/eat living warm blood from animals, normally pigs or goats when before he had been a vegan women. Also sun light even a little of it would give him 3rd degree burns, others had to deal with learning how to use special toilets, special showers and special clothing or walking around with no clothing at all. She could wear human clothing, minus a hole in the back for her tail. Overall she was lucky. <br />
For her some of the biggest surprises came when it came to classes about the society which was forming within the reservation which the government had set up to isolate monsters from humans. On the surface it was semi-normal, some buildings looked as if they had not been changed at all, others had been changed massively to allow larger monsters in. As she walked down the streets of what had once been a small town it was amazing to see gay and lesbian couples out in the open so much. Chris or Christina had been raised in a very religious farming community not that much different looking then this one she found herself now and same sex relations was never talked about here it was in the open. When he moved to the big city for school, he had come into contact with that type of society and he had never minded gay/lesbian couples, they where people like him. Still it was strange to see this out in the open. <br />
Besides that, there where things that would have been illegal in most places but had to be allowed because of requirements for different types of monster. Some demons type monsters like Succubus and Incubus required sex to live and as such prostitution where now legal and some monster even required to have 3 or more partners to have children so polygamy and polyandry were legal within the reservation. Turned out every type of monster could have children with any other type of monster, within reason. A giant couldn’t have children with a pixie but as long as the monsters where close in size it was possible but as long as their sizes where reasonable the same it was possible. <br />
“Alright…134 Maple Street.” Stated Chris as she drove toward an apartment complex located on a small hill. She was actually in her own beat up truck, that had been towed from her old tiny apartment and all her stuff, well his stuff had been moved first into storage and was now in a u-haul attached to her truck. All her old male cloths where in the trailer but none of those would really work with his new body but now she would have to get all new clothing and other items. She pulled into the apartment complex parking lot and looked at the information on the card. <br />
Because of the number of people coming into the reservation, there where few single bedroom apartments and most of them went to couples. Since she was single, she had been assigned to a 4 bed room apartment and now would have new roommates, it wasn’t all bad. The apartment complex was a lot nicer than the one she had lived in when she was a human man but she had no idea what sort of people…well monster she would be walking into. <br />
She parked her truck in the lot and walked up to the third floor and within a few moments found herself before the door marked 312. <br />
“Here goes…” said Chris as she reached up and prepared to knock on the door, better to knock first then use her key. She never got a chance as the door opened and a figure stood in the doorway.</p>
