<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To take care of any further obstructions by heading to the mall’s security office. She thought about sneaking there, but with all the musk and pheromones wafting off of her, she figured she could incapacitate or transform any resistance she faced.  Strolling through the halls, she got an idea to tease and pin the security guards one by one into submission. The first one she saw, she cornered him and got real big, spreading her arms and legs out to box him in. With him cornered, all he could see was her and all he could smell was her musk. Her pseudo penis started to get erect as she kept teasing him, and he started to melt and get erect being teased. Before long, Li was slapping her dick against a little mouse’s face. He came in his pants as Li walked away, too ashamed of himself to call for help or try to stop her. Each guard she came across fell in a similar way, each turning into an inferior anthro as she reached the head security office. A buff, older guy turned in a chair to face her. He wouldn’t be a pushover, but maybe he could be the one she needed to extend the challenge to another day. He had salt and pepper hair (same way with his beard and mustache), tanned skin, and bulging muscles in a shirt that seemed a little small on him. His ID tag had the name Doug on it, and he had a way of carrying himself that told anyone he took no bullshit.<br />
<br />
“You’re not allowed back here, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.” Doug said, his stance almost as wild as Li’s.<br />
“Sorry officer, I can’t do that. There’s something important I need from you.” Her gaze looked just as evil as her intentions, she didn’t even try to hide it.<br />
“If you won’t leave on your own, I’ll have to force you out. Since you are no longer a customer, you are considered trespassing and must vacate the premises.” Doug then charged at Li, ready to pin her down. Li just kept her smirk as she let him manhandle her, her erect cock starting to drip musky precum. At first, it didn’t seem like it was affecting him as he carried her by her waist to toss her out of the mall, but things changed as they reached the exit. He paused, unbuttoning his shirt as he started sweating. He set her down as he was overcome with a sweltering heat, taking off piece after piece of his uniform. He flexed his glistening muscles as he felt himself dip in and out of consciousness, each time he came back with leas intelligence and more feral instinct. He grew bigger, taller, and horny. The words alpha and mate kept repeating in his head to the point where it became all he could think about. His eyes became bloodshot as he felt his humanity slip further and further away. He took one look at the hyena and snarled at her, his skin growing darker as he took to more animalistic features. His hands became bigger, fatter, and meatier as he bore through the pain of his transformation. His feet burst out of his shoes as they became paws. His body exploded with red and black fur as he felt his dick tingle. It started by lengthening, getting more and more erect. Then, at full mast, it started to change shape into a more canine appearance. His teeth changed shape as his face extended out into a muzzle. At the same time, his spine pushed outward as a tail extended out just above his toned ass. His ears shifted higher up on his skull and changed shape as the fur spread up to his neck and face. His nose changed at the same time, turning into a big, cold, and wet canine nose. He was so overwhelmed with the transformation that he couldn’t stop his now faint canine sheath from exploding with seed. Li managed to evade just in time for the head guard to paint the wall and floor with hot, steamy wolf jizz. Li took out what looked like a sci-fi belt buckle and held it to his neck as it became a collar. His mind changed further as something else poked out of his skull. Two pointy horns that grew out from his head and down in front of his face, turning him from a wolf to a hellhound. He then looked at Li again, but instead of an urge to kill her it was different. Li was now his loving boss and the only one that knew just what he needed. Like a loyal pup, he sat on all fours in front of her, wagging his tail. Li giggled as she rubbed his chin, “Does my good boy need some release?” His body responded before he did as the red pecker started to poke out from his sheath. She took that as the go ahead to let him rut her like the animal he was. As she rode his cock, she started to release slime out of her ass, making him covered in her scent, which only made him more motivated to keep going. She started to piston her before pushing the knot inside her, leaning his entire body over her as they fucked. As soon as he came, she leaned up and bit his neck, dribbling a bit of fem-cum from her shaft as her insides filled with his load. <br />
<br />
For once, Li was actually exhausted. She had no doubt in her mind she was in the leas for the challenge, so she opted to call it a day as she took her new pet and loved home with her for the night. Where she had once tried to rid herself of her strong, animalistic musk, she had now grown so fond of it that she didn’t even want to bathe. With some semblance of decency left in her mind, she opted to not ruin multiple outfits and just walk around her house naked. With her and her pet inside, the area quickly filled with her scent, whatever candles, food, or garbage inside didn’t even come close to matching her smell. With her guts still full of cum, she went to the bathroom to try and purge it from her system before going to bed and calling it a night.</p>
