<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty had been perceiving what had been going on ever since he had a passing thought and accidentally wished he &quot;knew&quot; how the two were doing. His powers seem to have no limits and even passing thoughts seem to remold reality. As Ty was sitting on his bed in his room he knew what Dean was thinking, saying, and doing, likewise with Todd. <br />
<br />
Ty had already been making tweaks along the way, getting the timing right, keeping them calm. Giving Dean control of a few of Todd&#39;s bodily functions was a spur of the moment change and Ty laughed out loud at Todd&#39;s shock at the realization.<br />
<br />
Todd begged his dad to stop turning him on and focus on the problem at hand, and Dean complied, completely un-bothered  by the situation and having already decided that he is going to be a good penis for Todd. Not a trouble making penis that most men have. (Ty heard this and laughed, he couldn&#39;t have scripted it better if he tried.)<br />
<br />
Todd on the other hand was horrified about what would happen to his future if he couldn&#39;t fix this, would he go to an orphanage? He can&#39;t work yet. Who will pay his bills and take care of him? How can he explain his father&#39;s disappearance without becoming a science experiment or suspected murderer? <br />
<br />
Todd looked down at his penis, his father&#39;s face looked up at him, placid and calm. Todd reached down and touched his dad&#39;s face and could feel his dad&#39;s beard stubble as well as him touching his penis. &quot;Am I going to have to shave your face?&quot; Todd wondered aloud having been excited at the prospect of shaving, but not like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but you&#39;ll have to be very careful about my nose, I don&#39;t want you to lop it off.&quot; Dean said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Todd was manipulating his penis to find any remnants of his dads skeletal structure but it appeared his dad was just a face now, even pushing on his dad&#39;s face, it contorted and snapped back into place seeming to do no harm, as though dad&#39;s jaw and skull were now cartilage instead of bone.<br />
<br />
Ty was getting bored and wanted more fantastical changes. Undoing what he had created wouldn&#39;t be any fun but Ty did sympathize with Todd&#39;s fears. Ty thought about it and bit his lower lip as he schemed up a plan to keep Todd out of the system, keep him from being a freak, and giving him access to his father&#39;s support. &quot;Yes, that should work...&quot; Ty smiled and the universe shivered.<br />
<br />
Todd was examining his penis-father and the whole situation as scientifically as possible. Dean looked up at his son and said, &quot;Oh Son! That&#39;s one hell of a signal, you&#39;re about to make a mess, hold on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd looked down confused, &quot;What do you...&quot; until his penis lurched to attention. The room suddenly seemed 10 degrees warmer. Todd ran to the bathroom unsure what his dad meant by &quot;mess.&quot; Todd soon found out as everything brought him directly to climax. He had no down time after climax and was orgasming constantly. Chaos ensued, Todd went through a freight train of thoughts, feelings, and emotions over the next 90 or so seconds.<br />
<br />
Todd got to the bathroom and was unsure what to do, should he try to aim in the toilet? Lust was rapidly building. The sink? He twisted toward the sink thinking that might work better but the cold countertop lightly grazed the underside of his shaft. &quot;Ughh ughh&quot; Todd ejaculated and a load of cum splashed itself on the mirror. Dad&#39;s gonna be pissed! was Todd&#39;s initial reaction, then he realized his dad has no power anymore, which made Todd feel simultaneously powerful himself and sad, causing another immediate orgasm. <br />
<br />
Todd tried to aim better and touched his penis, that caused him to cum, but his penis was so excruciatingly sensitive his legs buckled beneath him. Collapsed to the floor he felt his abdominal muscles tighten and he came on the bathroom rug. He vaguely heard his father&#39;s voice cheering him on, &quot;Yeah Son! Get it. That&#39;s my boy!&quot; which was completely unlike him but the thought occurred that a penis only serves 2 functions. <br />
<br />
Todd was writhing on the floor, fear mixed with carnal bliss, and new levels of sensitivity were reached with each twist, turn, grind, or moan.<br />
<br />
Eventually Todd was able to come back to his senses. He found himself lying on the bathroom floor, the mat was sopping wet, and he knew it wasn&#39;t pee. there was an obvious line where the fibers were all worn, the spot he vigorously plowed. &quot;What the hell was that dad?&quot; Todd questioned angrily, his voice deeper and more gravely as though he was just awakening from a night of snoring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m.. just.. along.. for the ride&quot; Deans voice weakly replied.<br />
<br />
This alarmed Todd who quickly rolled over  and looked at his cock. Where his dad&#39;s face had been 3 dimensional, obvious, and identifiable was instead what could be easily mistaken for a tattoo of a featureless man&#39;s head. &quot;Dad!? Dad talk to me!? Dad, don&#39;t leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small slit opened where the image would have a mouth and Todd breathlessly watched as a bump arose forming a nose.<br />
<br />
Ty had planned this, Todd will need to know his father is okay with his fate and say good bye to the form he knew him in... even though Dean isn&#39;t really leaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not leaving you son. I understand now, this is a gift.&quot; Dean said with a little more strength but not as much as before this happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean Dad? I don&#39;t understand. Where are your eyes? Can&#39;t you come out like before?&quot; Todd was on the verge of tears. Ty&#39;s heart was breaking for the kid but soon he will understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe one last time.&quot; Dean said and clearly struggled as eyes slowly formed on the penis face.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last time? Dad, what do you mean?&quot; horror washed over Todd&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s eyes remained closed. &quot;I can see what you see, feel what you feel. Son, I&#39;m becoming a part of who you are. You will never be unable to reach me. When your friends bury their parents, I will be with you. We don&#39;t have long now.&quot; Dean strained one final time. His eyes finished forming and his face raised up from the shaft of Todd&#39;s penis but not as much as it had been. He blinked  his eyes and looked up at his son, adjusting to the new perspective. &quot;Oh... I see your changes have begun. I love you son and I&#39;ll always there to help you. It is every parent&#39;s wish come true to watch and guide... It&#39;s about to happen son.&quot; Dean&#39;s face deflated and quickly reverted back to a featureless tattoo.<br />
<br />
Ty had a flair for the dramatic and wanted Dean&#39;s parting to be meaningful but not drawn out. But he did need one more thing to happen... Todd was beginning to cry.. No no that wont do. Ty pushed gently, and Todd&#39;s despair was overcome with curiosity. &quot;What does he mean my changes??&quot; Todd thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Todd stood up and saw himself in the mirror, he looked around 18 or 19. He was now lean and muscular, with a faint beard shadow starting. Todd hadn&#39;t considered that his voice had changed because he had, he thought it was the situation.<br />
<br />
Ty was satisfied and Todd will have more than enough fuel to keep the ride going.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s penis lurched to full erection suddenly, like before, this time, he was already in the bathroom and took the few seconds he had to bolt into the shower and turn it on. Much like before Todd was quickly overcome but something inside him was telling him to enjoy the ride. Halfway through he managed to grab some conditioner and began stroking, feeling powerful, and having flashes of having sex with various women and eventually he even saw men partners.<br />
<br />
After several minutes Todd was left panting, lying under the stream of water. He glanced down at his penis, which he realized is much larger, but unadorned by a face or image of any kind. He wanted to feel sad and heartbroken but couldn&#39;t. His fingers trailed over his newly visible 8pk of abdomen muscles and pecs. He stood up and decided to take a shower since he was there already and had been rolling around on the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
Ty considered it would be a travesty for humanity to lose Dean&#39;s physical perfection so it was passed on to Todd. Todd would soon realize, he knows everything his dad did. From navigating the town and local stores, how to make a pot of coffee, to how to get to work and do the job, to sexual positions, Todd now had the experience of a 48 year old bi sexual engineer, is knowledgeable of current trends like a 15 year old, all wrapped into the body of a very hot 23 year old. To everyone but Ty and Todd, the world will think Todd&#39;s father passed when he was 20. The house, Dean&#39;s 401k, bank accounts, now all in Todd&#39;s name.</p>
