<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa stood quietly in the bedroom that she normally shared with her husband, and Moon Lake&#39;s mayor, Martin Stovall. He was still out in California as far as she knew, helping with his mother after her rollerblading accident. And while she didn&#39;t wish her mother-in-law any ill will, she did wish that Martin could be there to hold her, to cuddle with her, and do other things with her. He had made her happy and had been kind and patient with her as she dealt with her own personal worries over weres, possibly becoming one, and the fact that Martin WAS one during their courtship. However, that had another consequence, as once Melissa had realized just how much she loved Martin and became his mermaid, she&#39;d felt joy in being with him like nothing she&#39;d ever experienced as a Normal. She could only assume that Martin felt the same way in being with her, and that made her seriously question why she&#39;d been so nervous on the issue.<br />
<br />
Her own transformation had been beautiful and Martin was very gentle with her. The memory of that made Melissa smile, but it also made her question why she waited? Why didn&#39;t she just hump Martin when he first proposed and make love to him then and there? They loved each other and missed out on years of true happiness because of her own fears and nervousness. It was why she had helped put the plan together to allow Julie to welcome Eric into were society with some privacy and to let her be happy. She agreed with Martin in her hoping that Julie wouldn&#39;t take that as an excuse to put aside her studies or begin looking for excuses to have sex. She new that neither Julie nor Eric would be able to go without enjoying their time together, but hoped that they would maintain some measure of control over themselves. So far though, they had shown good control, and looked happy together, and that was Melissa&#39;s true goal. She wanted to Julie to have a long and happy life, not one where she would be living with some uncertainty as to whether or not Eric loved her back.<br />
<br />
Seeing them cuddled on the couch that morning and overhearing their soft and friendly conversation through the morning and afternoon assured Melissa that her part in the plan had worked and that her daughter would get to be happy. However, seeing Julie and Eric so in love and so happy together only served to remind her that her merman wasn&#39;t home. That left her wishing to speak with Martin and she essentially sneaked upstairs and dialed a number on her cellphone. She then raised it to her head to listen for the answer she wanted to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, dear,&quot; came Martin&#39;s voice after a few moments, making Melissa smiled, &quot;how is the most beautiful mer in Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing fine,&quot; Melissa said with her smile, feeling much better at just hearing his voice, &quot;I miss you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... I miss you too,&quot; Martin replied, &quot;but the good news is that we&#39;ve managed to get things set with regard to my mother. She&#39;s still a bit grumpy at having to pretend to have a broken leg, but doing well enough that she can manage on her own now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good to hear,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;you did send her my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Martin replied over the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;When are you coming home?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be heading back tomorrow morning,&quot; Martin assured her, &quot;I will be going safely and slowly, but I should be home by Tuesday morning at the absolute latest, though Monday will be the most likely day of arrival.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa smiled at that and actually twirled in the room as she imagined herself with her husband, in all sorts of happy and romantic moments, sort of like what she had seen with Eric and Julie. Her daydream at her husband&#39;s return was soon broken when she heard what Martin said next.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how is Julie making out?&quot; Martin asked, &quot;She and Eric doing okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie&#39;s doing well,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;Very loving... they&#39;ve spent much of today playing video game tennis... and from what I could overhear and occasionally look in on... were absolutely adorable in doing so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good... good,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;how have they looked control-wise?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa knew that was in relation to the developments in Eric and Julie&#39;s courtship. How fast and how firmly they had fallen in love with each other had lead them to the point where the two of them would begin to need other and that by the end of the year, both Eric and Julie would feel the need to mate, as their bonds were so strong that Eric&#39;s eyes had begun to change color. That was a good part of the reason why she&#39;d worked out the plan for Eric&#39;s transformation ahead of time. She was sure that Julie could resist those urges, but it wouldn&#39;t be a real romantic moment if Melissa took Julie Christmas shopping and having Julie reach the point where she couldn&#39;t fight it anymore. Thanks to the plan, Eric and Julie at least had the option for a romantic and happy moment. <br />
<br />
However, Martin&#39;s mother&#39;s injury had come about so suddenly that Melissa never got the time to really run by the idea with Martin, and that worried Melissa a little. He might not even respond well to the fact that through the plan, Julie and Eric really didn&#39;t fight their urges. The only thing that was in Melissa&#39;s favor was that Julie had made comment that at the time she was having some of the same trouble in controlling her own urges. Their ability to resist was getting weaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... they have control now,&quot; Melissa said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now?&quot; Martin asked, sounding puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie had made mention to me that she was already feeling the effects of their forming bond,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;especially as Eric was also reciprocating it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... it&#39;s happened,&quot; Martin said slowly and in a tone of voice that he suspected it and was already fairly certain about things already. In that, Melissa knew it was best not to try and hide anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melissa said looking down toward her feet. She shuffled them nervously as Martin didn&#39;t initially answer her. &quot;Though in a more deliberate plan... to let the mood be more romantic than them suddenly becoming overcome with pure lust. Let them be happy together as they deserve to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Martin sighed heavily, &quot;but they are happy and are in control of themselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;like you predicted... truly in love. The transformation was also completely willing, so there is no Statute 1A case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; came Martin&#39;s reply, &quot;it&#39;s... it&#39;s all very nervous because they&#39;re so young, but so long as they are happy, that is all that matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;they are happy... there is some more you should know, but that&#39;d be best saved for when you get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad news?&quot; Martin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, more good news than bad,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;more nervous than bad as well. It&#39;ll be something better discussed when you get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa heard a sigh on the other end, &quot;She&#39;s not pregnant, is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dear, she&#39;s still on her pill,&quot; Melissa assured her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;I miss you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa heard him blow a kiss into the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss you, too,&quot; Melissa said back to them and Melissa heard him blow a kiss into his phone.<br />
<br />
Melissa did the same before saying, &quot;I miss you two.&quot;</p>
