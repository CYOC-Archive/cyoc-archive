<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You immediately understood the question and one name stuck out in your mind, the thought made your heart skip a beat and brought a tear  to your eye. Amelie, your best friend and classmate in college, a student from France studying abroad. She was a thoughtful poet’s soul, and she always felt out of her depth. Her family was wealthy but neglectful, from what you gather she was raised bounced from private school to private school. Her beautiful soul would make her an even more beautiful mermaid. And to make matters better, she was already as lesbian as they come.<br />
<br />
“I know who I will sing for.” You said, taking Miranda’s hand in yours. “Shall we duet?” <br />
<br />
“Of course… just follow after me and do what comes naturally, and keep this person in your mind as you sing.” She then begins breaking into a beautiful lyricless soprano, the notes coming from her lips reverberating in your chest. As your voice joined hers, the music traveled out beyond the confines of this cove beyond space and reached the ears of Amelie, who was walking the same beach as you alongside the rest of your college friends. The young woman’s ears perked up, and as the music infiltrated her heart, it pointed the way to the cove, which revealed itself before her like a mirage on the horizon. <br />
<br />
As Amelie walked into the cove, you got to see her with new eyes for the first time. You always knew she was a pretty woman before, now she made your heart flutter and butterflies fill your stomach. Her long braided brown hair, soft white skin, pensive blue eyes, voluptuous frame and already buxom chest, already much on display in a two piece swimsuit. Her hair was damp and heavy, beads of water trailed on her skin, a towel sat on her waist, it was clear she’d been out for a swim tonight already.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened as you heard her voice in that beautiful accent. “Where am I? Wait, sirènes?! Am I seeing things?” <br />
<br />
“Not at all, stranger.” Miranda spoke, coiling her tail on a rock as she casually got up to sun. The rest of the mermaids appeared to have ventured off on their own for now, leaving just you three in the grotto. “We are as real as they come, including your friend Camilla.”<br />
<br />
“Greetings, Amelie, I realize I probably was not immediately recognizable like this…” you wrung water out of your vibrant pink hair. “Do you like the new hair? I think the color suits me.” <br />
<br />
“It’s… incredible. Camilla, what happened? What did this to you?” She exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“I owe it all to Miranda, she offered me this gift, and I seized it eagerly.” You pulled your arms up on the shelf of the pool, and Miranda reached over to pull your hair back, kissing the back of your neck. As you let a soft coo escape your lips, you see Amelie cross her legs, her cheeks darken red as she watched you.<br />
<br />
“And Camilla and I can do the same for you, if you so choose. That is why she sang her siren song to you.”<br />
<br />
“To… me?” Amelie paused. “You wanted to make me a mermaid too?”<br />
<br />
“Only if you desired it…” you answered, meeting her gaze.<br />
 <br />
“I do.” She answered quickly. “You are beautiful, Camilla. I admit, I’ve always thought so.”<br />
<br />
“And I feel the same way…” you said, your heart racing as she knelt down close to you. “Join me in the water then, I do not wish to delay your change another second.” <br />
<br />
Amelie took your hand and as you had been pulled into this world a moment ago, you pulled her in.<br />
<br />
She splashed down in the water, instantly holding fast to you for safety. As your strong tail kept you both afloat, she held tight around your shoulders. Your foreheads touch, her breath warm on your lips and sweet in your nose. She pulled you into a kiss first, and you begin to breathe the sea’s magic into her body just as Miranda had done to you. Her eyes closed as her body convulsed from the shiver of power flowing through her. You could feel her lips softening upon yours, humming slightly as goosebumps broke out down her neck. Her eyes opened changed, the irises now a silvery white with icy blue rings around the edges. Her braid of hair stayed in place, her growing hair extending the neat weave itself all the way down to her mid-back, changing one lock at a time into a half white, half pale blue color, the two hues braided into each other. She gasped as she saw what was happening. “That is so cute on me… too bad I never had the guts to dye until now!” <br />
<br />
“It is gorgeous.” You told her. “Now Amelie, follow me and my instructions. We must bring each other to the edge of climax, then, we must release together. Are you ready?”<br />
<br />
“And yearning.” She answered, already you noticed she had taken off her swimsuit bottom. Her bikini wouldn’t have lasted much longer, either. Already you noticed her already massive cleavage getting bigger still. In her human shape she already had breasts as large as yours after your turn into a mermaid. You kissed down to her breast and helped her undo her top, even as her bosom began to erupt in silvery white scales, her ears morphing into fins at the same time. While yours arced upwards, hers sloped down. The scales supported and held up her chest, soothing what could have become a painful change otherwise. Your lips brushed the scales, and Amelie moaned with pleasure. “Camilla! That’s so hot, I feel like a goddess right now.”<br />
<br />
“You deserve to.” You told her as your tail snaked around her legs. With one hand around the back of her neck, the other ventured down toward her womanhood, the hot petals contrasting the cold water. You began to touch her with masterful dexterity and the skill of a talented courtesan, all skills acquired mere moments ago. <br />
<br />
Amelie’s cheeks were burning hot and red, but heeding your instructions, she prepared to reciprocate. While your fingers entered her, she had found the vent in your tail hosting your own vagina. You gasped as you discovered her newly webbed fingers, connected to the knuckle with azure webs. You hadn’t know till now, but inside your folds, those silky webs stimulated you like nothing seen before. Miranda, who’d been watching so far, casted a mischievous and knowing smirk at you.<br />
<br />
As you merrily fucked each other, you found it harder and harder to get good leverage with your fingers inside of her. You realized that it was because her legs were merging from the waist down into Amelie’s new silvery white piscine form. Once her womanhood had reconfigured to face comfortably out from her tail, you resumed your work. In the meantime, Amelie giggled as she held your back and pressed your breasts against her own, both of you sighing as you felt each other’s scales rub erotically together. You leaned in and kissed and worshipped her endowments. You could tell she neared her climax, and in your gut you could tell you’d have to slow your pace. Going from a frenzied and assertive touch, to a slower tempo, you gently rocked your hips and hand, coaxing her along in a slow waltz of pleasure. <br />
<br />
“I’m… almost… ready.” You panted as you traded the leading role back and forth between each other until your ministrations reached perfect synchronicity. As you both came together, you took your hand out of her and pressed your flooding womanhood to hers, allowing your fluids to merge and mingle in the water. Her toes disappeared into the end of her tailfin, and Amelie sighed as she relaxed, letting herself float in the water freely as you released her. Her mind was filling with all the wisdom and knowledge she would need to live among mermaidkind, her lips turned up in a smile of bliss.<br />
<br />
“Oh Camilla… I am going to enjoy this life a lot…” her words sounded almost like song.</p>
