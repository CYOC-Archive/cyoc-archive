<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fifteen year old Warren leaned back in the metal deck chair and tried to tune out everything but the shade from the awning he was sitting under. Around him, the late July heat blasted what was left the lawn a feet from the patio into something that looked withered and almost dead. Inside, he could hear his parents were having another argument, this time about how his dad had done something with another woman, which led to accusations that his mom had done something with another man.<br />
<br />
In his lap was a tom cat, the family pet, and the only friend Warren considered his own. Idly, he reached out and stroked the orange fur and, not first time, wished he could live the life of a feline. His thoughts drifted and he considered how easy life seemed for the cat in his lap, Marty, but then banished the thoughts as he told himself, &quot;Get over it. This is your life,&quot; as the screen door slid open and his older brother, Jason, stepped outside, tossed a package in his lap and stated, &quot;Mail for you, dickweed,&quot; before he disappeared back inside, presumably to prepare for the math lesson he had to give in a little while.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t like it when his brother, who was five years older than he was, and one of the arguments their parents had, as their dad wanted Jason to move out, whilst their mother insisted that he wasn&#39;t ready to live on his own, something Jason agreed with, called him names. Trying to not let the insult bother him, he listened as, inside, a door slammed, which Warren took to mean dad had stormed out once again, and that they would pick up where they&#39;d left off when he came home. Waiting a moment, he soon heard the soft click as mom disappeared into her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t start arguments, would you?&quot; he asked the cat, who merely squinted at him and gave him a throaty purr.<br />
<br />
Warren took this as a sign that Marty agreed and turning his attention to the package Jason had thrown at him, he noted that it looked like someone had stuck an address label over another. Tempted to peel it off, he instead wondered who it was from, as there was no return address. Gently, he lifted the cat from his lap, put him on the flagstone, stood and went inside to find something to cut open the sealing tape. Once he had the box open, he unwrapped the tissue paper and stared at the necklace that had been placed inside, his first thought being that it was hideous before he asked himself who had sent it to him as he took it from the package.<br />
<br />
A word printed on one side, Zulo, whilst on the other was a image that depicted either a man or woman in the throes of a painful transformation, and Warren found himself perplexed. Taking it into the study, he noted that Jason wasn&#39;t there, and figuring he had a little time, he sat down at the computer and began to run a quick search.<br />
<br />
Engrossed in what he was doing, Warren didn&#39;t hear his brother come in until the older boy said, &quot;Hey, dickweed. Whatch looking up? Porn? Dad catches you doing that, he&#39;ll have your hide,&quot; before snapping up the amulet and demanding, &quot;What&#39;s this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not willing to share what he&#39;d found, Warren closed the site that had been created by some user with the name Boucher and told his brother, &quot;Don&#39;t know. It was in that package you said I got in the mail,&quot; as he swivelled the desk chair about to look at Jason, who peered intently at the image for a moment before he tossed it at his brother and announced, &quot;It&#39;s cheap costume jewellery. Give it to a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was one thing Warren had considered, as some of the things he&#39;d read online seemed outlandish and impossible. But, as he caught the necklace, he found he was curious and that, before he gave it away, he did want to try something. Standing as his brother snapped, &quot;Whatever. In the meantime, scram. Kathy is coming over for her math lesson and I have to make sure the website works. Otherwise, I don&#39;t get paid jack for today.&quot;<br />
<br />
All to happy to leave, as thirteen-year-old Kathy, a girl who lived next door who often had a snotty, superior attitude, and was taking summer classes to make up what she missed during seventh grade, Warren hasitly left the office. A glance at the necklace, which he&#39;d started to think of as the Amulet of Zulo, and he headed for his bedroom. There, as a plan formed as to what he could do, he fished out from his closet a jar he kept his allowance in. Counting out twenty dollars, figuring that it would be enough, he exited his bedroom, grabbed his sandals and bike helmet, and with a quick word to his mom&#39;s closed bedroom door, &quot;I&#39;m going downtown for a bit,&quot; he headed out.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Warren parked his bike in the garage and headed inside. From the office he could hear Jason&#39;s voice as he explained something to Kathy, and content to ignore them, Warren kicked off his sandals and headed outside. Across the yard, he slipped behind the rusted tool shed and sat down with his back against the hot metal. Alone, shielded on one side by the fence and the shed on the other, he ignored the heat that caused his back to break out heavily in sweat as he took from the bag his purchase, a grey and black cat collar with the name Rune stamped on it. Setting aside the bag, he glanced about before he took from the lower pocket of his cargo shorts the Amulet of Zulo. Not quite sure what he&#39;d read was accurate, and what he was considering trying would work, he peered at the two, but didn&#39;t touch them together.<br />
<br />
His thoughts conflicted, he set the collar down in the grass and then, after a moment&#39;s thought, the necklace on the bag. Another glance about and he sighed, &quot;Might as well get this over,&quot; before he started to reach for the collar, stopped and glanced down at the shorts and tank top he had on.<br />
<br />
Questions of what would happen to his clothes crossed his mind and not sure what would happen he considered what he could do before he stood. Nervous about what he was about to do, he thought about forgetting the whole thing and just giving the costume trinket away. But wanting an answer, he hesitated a moment longer before he reached down and grasped the hem of his tank top. Shucking off his clothes, he sat back down, leaned against the shed, hissed in pain and leaned forward. Reaching for the collar, he picked it up and gazed it. Curious to know what type of cat wore it, and whether it would be the same breed as Marty, he picked up the amulet, took a deep breath, hoped that it work, that Marty wouldn&#39;t mind another cat, and touched the two together.<br />
<br />
A shock, like the time he&#39;d touched a piece of metal and got an static electric shock, rippled through his hand, up his arm, and through his chest. Unable to hold onto the necklace and the collar, he dropped both, then, for reasons he couldn&#39;t fathom, reached down for the collar, and affixed it round his neck. Not sure how it could fit, the thought was driven from his mind when he noticed that he now had six nipples. Reaching a hand down to touch one, needing to know they were real, he stopped when he saw his hand.<br />
<br />
Covered now in black fur, his thumb and pinkie had shrunk as his remaining his fingers morphed into a cat&#39;s front toes. Excited by what he saw, he tried to state, &quot;It worked,&quot; but only managed to make a weird meowing sound as fawn coloured fur sprouted on his arms.<br />
<br />
Fur starting to appear on his torso, he again wondered what type of cat he would be and shifting in place, he placed his now front paws flat. Legs beginning to shrink, feet becoming back paws, Warren shivered as he felt himself shift to a creature that went about on four legs. His excitement continued to grow until he looked down at his cock and balls and stared in surprise as they regressed, folded inward and became girl parts. Not wanting to be a girl cat, Warren expressed himself with a series of yowls and hisses and he tried to remember what he&#39;d read about the Amulet of Zulo and when he could use it a second time.<br />
<br />
His transformation near complete, he squeezed his eyes into a squint, like Marty would often do, as he recalled he would have to wait twelve hours. A purr of contentment escaped him as he thought he could do this, remain as a girl cat for twelve hours, then it would be a simple matter to turn himself back. Dipping his head down, he licked his front paw, stood, stretched, and started to consider all he could do when he was suddenly overcome with the strangest sensation. Shifting in place, he hissed again as he felt, starting in his female cat parts, an almost like a tingly sensation that was almost an ache that not only went up inside him, but all over his body as well.<br />
<br />
Not sure what was wrong, he meowed, dipped his head down, bent his forelegs, raised his rear end, and held his tail up and to the side. Hind legs treading in place, Warren tried to vocalise his concern some more, but instead made a sound of what, of need. Spotting his clothes, he had an idea of how to satisfy himself as he managed to sidle over and positioning himself, he began to alternate between licking himself and rubbing against the garments.<br />
<br />
No longer certain he could be a girl siamese cat for twelve hours, sure he&#39;d go mad from the odd sensation that came from his girl parts, Warren struggled to get control of himself as he thought the best thing he could do was find some place to hide and ride out the time until he could turn back into a human. Ready to take off across the yard, he stopped when he remembered the necklace. Uttering the same noises to announce how he felt, Warren hissed and looked at the amulet and down at his clothes. Knowing he couldn&#39;t take them with, he forced himself to try and hold still as he inched closer, dipped his head, hind end up, presenting himself, he clamped the amulet in his mouth, tried to move it, couldn&#39;t, shifted, gripped the chain instead, and began to drag to piece of jewellery toward the house.<br />
<br />
The going slow, Warren made it almost across the yard before he became aware of a smell. It was the most wonderful scent he had had ever smelled and a quick look about revealed he wasn&#39;t the only cat outside when he saw Marty, a couple feet away, sitting on the patio. The chain slipped from his mouth, Warren had a sudden inspiration of what was wrong with him and scared by what it meant, he tried to keep himself calm, even as his new body betrayed him and he found himself yowling, turning to present himself, and treading in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no. I don&#39;t want that,&quot; he thought as he struggled to try and force himself to put his tail down, to sit down, but found he couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
And then, quicker than he thought was possible, Marty was atop him, probing him, nipping at his neck to pin him in place, and unsure what to do, Warren surrended himself to what was to come, thinking, &quot;Might as well get this over,&quot; even as found not only was he enjoying what was happening, he was looking forward what was to come. And then came the oddest sensation, but, at the same time, the most satisfying feeling he&#39;d ever felt, as Marty inserted his barbed cock.</p>
