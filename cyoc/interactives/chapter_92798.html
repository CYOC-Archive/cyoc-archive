<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I felt like drifting off to sleep, but I couldn’t let myself do that.  I was afraid that if I fell asleep I would wake up to find out that none of this had happened.  I felt like there were a lot of cool things that I could do with this ring, even if the conditions for using it might become a drag.  Naturally, I kept thinking about my transformation.  As if the physical part of the change wasn’t enough to deal with, the mental part of it was something else entirely.  <br />
<br />
In so many ways it felt absolutely like a dream.  I was conscious, I knew what was going on and yet everything felt so distant and hazy.  But I’d never had a dream where I was someone else.  I was always myself in any dream I could ever remember.  That’s how I knew I wasn’t dreaming now.  I had been someone else.  An entirely different person had taken over my body and shared, or rather, controlled, my mind.<br />
<br />
I didn’t know quite what to make of Bambi.  She did seem like a female version of me in a few ways.  She was a bit short-tempered.  She was definitely average in intelligence, and therefore she was quick to emphasize she was not dumb.  She did seem to enjoy her body, however.  And, oh, that body.<br />
<br />
Without really noticing, my hands drifted down to my pants.  I didn’t take notice as I unbuttoned my jeans and rubbed my cock.  I was completely thinking of Bambi’s body.  I tried to remember as best I could what it felt like to wear that body.  That is, I tried to remember what it felt like to have those tits, to have that ass, to have a slit between my legs instead of a cock.  I couldn’t seem to remember exact details.  I did remember that it felt good.<br />
<br />
Suddenly at this point I realized that I wasn’t rubbing or stroking my cock anymore.  I realized that I was actually pushing it into my body.  I looked down at myself and saw my hands trying to force my cock inside me somehow.  I said aloud, “What the fuck is wrong with me?”<br />
<br />
Then to my extreme surprise and slight worry, a familiar voice said, “It looks like you want to be me again.”  My hands shot up from my cock and slammed over my mouth.  It was Bambi’s voice and I didn’t just hear it in my head.  It came out of my mouth.<br />
<br />
It was at this point that I noticed my cock was shrinking in size.  I also realized that my fingernails were growing longer.  I removed my hands from my mouth and I said, “No, this isn’t right.  I’m not supposed to do this!”<br />
<br />
Immediately Bambi’s voice spoke again, “Well, then, why don’t you stop it?”  Her voice sounded both questioning and teasing.  It was as if she genuinely wanted to know how I could stop the transformation that had begun, yet somehow knew that I didn’t know how I’d started it and could not stop it.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know how,” I admitted.  I stood up off the bed.  My pants fell down to my ankles to reveal Bambi’s long, smooth legs.  My cock had already shrunk to the size of that of a very young boy.  “Oh, I’m gonna get in trouble!” I whined.  I was legitimately concerned about that.  “Why can’t I stop this from happening?”<br />
<br />
Bambi’s voice said, “You know why you can’t stop.  Don’t worry, I won’t do anything too mischievous.  Promise.”<br />
<br />
I felt hair tickle my shoulder blades.  My cock was sucked up into Bambi’s now present vagina.  I felt my chest expand as two breasts tented underneath my shirt.  I felt myself slipping away.  “You…better…not,” I managed to say.  Then I fell backward onto the bed and everything went black.<br />
<br />
I woke up feeling a bit dizzy.  “Blimey,” I said.  “Where am I?”  I realized I was laying on a bed looking at a ceiling.  “Oh, right, I’m in Joe’s bedroom.”  Everything felt a bit odd.  I sat up and found meself in Joe’s clothes.  Well, sort of.  His pants were down around me feet and so me legs and me naughty bits were exposed.  I had his shoes and his shirt on.<br />
<br />
I looked around the room.  It looked as I’d imagined Joe’s room would look.  Stuff was laying about everywhere and it seemed a bit dirty.  “Typical male,” I said aloud.  I figured this was a chance for me to use the ring.  “I wish everything in this room was picked up and in order how it’s s’posed to be.”  With a flash everything that had been on the floor or hanging over a chair or just not in the right place was gone.  I guessed it had all gone to where it should.  I wasn’t going to check, though.<br />
<br />
I was about to reach down and take off Joe’s shoes until I realized I could just kick ‘em off me feet instead.  I stepped out of Joe’s pants and stripped off his shirt.  Now I was good and naked again.  “Hello, girls,” I said to me titties.  I gave ‘em a nice, good squeeze.  I didn’t know why, really.  I guess I had to make sure they were real.  This whole sharing a body thing made me wonder if I was real or not.<br />
<br />
It occurred to me that I hadn’t yet seen meself the way the others had.  I looked ‘round the room for a mirror, but couldn’t find one.  I walked out of the bedroom and headed for the bathroom.  Even though I’d never been here before as me, I knew where everything was since I had all of Joe’s knowledge.  I found the bathroom door closed.  I was about to walk right in but then I stopped.  I searched Joe’s memories but could not remember if the bathroom was tidy or not.  I didn’t fancy the thought of walking into a disgusting bathroom so I made another wish for it to be perfectly clean and organized.<br />
<br />
I waited a few seconds and then walked into the bathroom.  Me wish had worked perfectly.  Everything was sparkling clean.  I turned me attention to the mirror over the sink.  I had to do a double take as I caught sight of meself.  “Whoa,” I said.  “That’s me?”  I could see why Allan warned me about going out in public.  I’d have lads drooling over me.  I don’t mean to sound cocky or what, but I did have these great, big titties and a nice, round ass.  But I also had a very pretty face with nice, full lips and pretty eyes.  I might stop traffic if I wore the right outfit.<br />
<br />
That made me wonder what I should wear right now.  I promised Joe I wouldn’t do anything bad.  To me that meant I should just stay at the apartment and relax.  I didn’t know when or if Joe might decide to be himself again and trigger the change.  Even I knew getting caught in public doing that would be just a bit of a problem.  <br />
<br />
I walked back to Joe’s room and picked up the shirt I’d taken off a few minutes ago.  I put it back on.  It was large enough that it covered me down to me thighs, even with me titties taking up so much room.  Eh. I thought to meself.  This’ll do for now, I thought.  I headed for the living room.  I decided I’d watch the telly for a while.  Just as I was about to sit on the couch, there was a very loud knock on the door.</p>
