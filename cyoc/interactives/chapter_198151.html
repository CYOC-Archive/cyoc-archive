<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
After lunch, Jack decided the best thing he could do was leave the two lovebirds alone.  Their talk had seemed to go well, and even though he had some reservations about Gemory&#39;s true identity, what could he do about it?  She made Danielle happy.<br />
<br />
That having been said, he figured maybe doing some research on demons was in order.  Just in case.  He got into his truck and drove the city library.<br />
<br />
<br />
As he wandered from bookshelf, to bookshelf, he realized he was being followed.  He thought it was a coincidence at first, but no, he kept seeing the same two girls.  One looked to be college age, with curly blonde hair, wearing a black hoodie and jeans.<br />
<br />
The other, holding the taller girl&#39;s hand and trying to hide in her shadow, was a little girl of 7 or 8, he supposed.  She was wearing a pink hoodie and a skirt.<br />
<br />
He wondered what they wanted with him, but there was a chance they weren&#39;t human.  Which meant they could be a threat to Danielle.  He ducked around a corner, then lay in wait.<br />
<br />
The instant the taller girl came around the corner, he confronted her.  She gasped in surprised, and he noticed she had pretty hazel eyes.<br />
<br />
“Mon Dieu!” The girl spoke with a mild French accent.  “You frightened me!”<br />
<br />
The little girl was trying even harder to stay out of his direct line of sight.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re following me.  Why?”  Jack was an easygoing man, but he was tall and strong, and could be imposing when he needed to be.  He figured this was one of those times.<br />
<br />
“I...that is...I wasn&#39;t...” The young woman stammered.<br />
<br />
The little girl let out a deep, annoyed sigh.  “God damn it, Jack, stop scaring her.”<br />
<br />
He knew that tone.  But the voice was far too young.  He looked at the girl.  “I&#39;m sorry, who are you?”<br />
<br />
The girl pulled back her hoodie, revealing long blonde hair.  She looked up at him with familiar green eyes.  She was a dead ringer for his daughter at that age!  But the eyes seemed harder, like gemstones.  Like...<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re Natalie&#39;s daughter.”  There was no other explanation.  There was something about her that he couldn&#39;t put his finger on though.  Something that made her even more attractive than her mother...<br />
<br />
She sighed again.  “So close, yet so far.  No Jack, it&#39;s me.  I&#39;m Natalie.”<br />
<br />
“Is this some kind of prank?  Is your Mom going to jump out of nowhere and serve me with papers?  I don&#39;t know what she could sue me for at this point...”<br />
<br />
“Damn it, Jack!”  The little girl stamped her foot.  “You haven&#39;t changed, you never listen!”<br />
<br />
The taller girl put a hand on the younger one&#39;s shoulder gently.  “Natalie.”<br />
<br />
Instantly the girl&#39;s (Jack couldn&#39;t believe she was actually his ex-wife) demeanor changed.  She looked down, her cheeks flushing with shame.  “I&#39;m sorry, Camille.”<br />
<br />
“There, there, Mon Cheri.  Mr. Western, I know this is unbelievable, but could we go someplace to talk?”  Camille had an earnest look about her that Jack found he trusted, even in the face of the unbelievable.<br />
<br />
<br />
He drove both girls to a restaurant he and Dani frequented often.  Not having a carseat, the little girl sat quietly in Camille&#39;s lap.  He was glad nobody pulled him over.<br />
<br />
They sat in a corner booth- this time of day, the restaurant was quiet, and he knew the Server, Tina.  She&#39;d leave them alone until he signaled her.<br />
<br />
After the girls ate, Natalie told her story.  The instant she described Gemory, his doubts vanished.  What had the demon done?<br />
<br />
“Wait.  Dani did this to you?  Our Dani?”  He was schocked.  “But she&#39;s not a de...” He bit off the word.<br />
<br />
“So you know then.  About Gemory.”  Natalie&#39;s eyes were dark.<br />
<br />
“Just found out earlier today.”  Jack admitted.<br />
<br />
“And you&#39;re alright with that!?”  Natalie exclaimed, but just like before, Camille&#39;s touch calmed her down.<br />
<br />
“Not that I have to justify myself to you one damn bit, but not completely.  She makes Dani happy, I&#39;ve seen that.  But given what she is, well, I was at the library for a reason.  Figured I needed to learn more.  What, were you here to warn me?”<br />
<br />
Natalie frowned, then sighed.  “I was going to, but that&#39;s not the main reason.”  She seemed to have a hard time looking him in the eye.<br />
<br />
“You have no idea how badly I want to laugh at you right now.  Or throw back all the shit you said to me over the years.  Or maybe even just bitch you out for how you treated your daughter.  But...”  He sighed.  “That&#39;s not who I am.  So come on, Nat, why are you here?”<br />
<br />
“I wish you would yell at me.”  Natalie said.  “You never would, until I got you so angry...and even then, you hated it.  I was horrible to you and Danielle.”  She finally looked up at him.  “I shouldn&#39;t be here.  Raphael told us to lay low, not draw attention to ourselves.  But it kept nagging me.  I&#39;m here to say I&#39;m sorry, Jack.”<br />
<br />
Jack blinked at her.  This little girl that once been a woman he loved with all his heart, until she pushed him away.  But he knew her apology was sincere.  Because Natalie never apologized.  “That took a lot out of you, didn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
Natalie nodded.  “Never apologize.  It makes you seem weak.  I was so stupid.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s your Mother talking.  Now her, I did laugh at.”<br />
<br />
“What, you&#39;ve seen her?”  Natalie was surprised.<br />
<br />
“Few years back, she came demanding her Grandparent&#39;s rights.  Wanted to see Dani.  I told her to go jump in a lake.  Then she begged me for money.  The woman who said she wouldn&#39;t give me a dime, and that I would never be able to take care of you.  I laughed at her until she ran off, and I didn&#39;t even feel bad.”<br />
<br />
Natalie shook her head.  “Unbelievable.”<br />
<br />
“Anyways, Nat.  You hurt me.  You were the world to me, and I thought we were happy.  But then you suddenly acted like the life we had wasn&#39;t good enough for you.  That you didn&#39;t want anything to do with us.  I could forgive you for that.  But I can&#39;t forgive you for what you did to Dani.”<br />
<br />
She nodded.  “I know.  And I want to apologize to her too, just...right now...I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve earned that right.  I&#39;ve accepted my punishment.  It&#39;s...better than I deserve.  But I had to try and reach out to you.”<br />
<br />
Jack reached across the table and held out his hand.  She reached over and he took it, giving it a gentle squeeze.  She burst into tears, remembering the good times, the things she&#39;d thrown away.<br />
<br />
Camille put her arms around the girl, holding her.<br />
<br />
“So you two are together?  I&#39;m not even going to ask how that works.”<br />
<br />
Natalie blushed, but Camille seemed proud.  “Yes. I love her and will protect her always.”<br />
<br />
“I hope you treat her right, Natalie.”<br />
<br />
Nat nodded.  “I don&#39;t deserve her, but I will.  She&#39;s...been good for me.”<br />
<br />
“Well.  Good.  You&#39;re half-forgiven, Natalie.  If there&#39;s enough human left in you to make this girl starry-eyed just to look at you, then I guess I can give you that much.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Jack.  I hope I can earn the rest of that forgiveness some day.”  Natalie said softly.<br />
<br />
“Well, let&#39;s celebrate that.  Nat, you used to love peach cobbler.  They have a really good one here, with homemade ice cream.”<br />
<br />
Natalie smiled.  “I would like that.”<br />
<br />
“As would I.”  Camille smiled.<br />
<br />
So the three of them had dessert.  And it -was- pretty good.</p>
