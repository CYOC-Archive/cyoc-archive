<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As was their usual procedure Maureen put the kettle on and the ladies bought out their purchases to show them off to Maureen&#39;s husband Roger. Every week it was up to Roger to judge who had got the best bargain. It should be noted that Liz had a history with Roger. The two had been friends (but not lovers) at college and it had been Liz who had first introduced Maureen to Roger.<br />
<br />
Roger knew he had to rotate frequently his decision on  who had made the best purchase. He was not allowed to return to his shed and his latest project until this decision had been made. On this particular day Roger judged Liz&#39;s purchase of a &#39;Fascinator&#39; for $1 to be the best bargain of the day.  That was of course not before flirting with Liz and saying how &quot;I&#39;ll look forward to seeing you all dressed up and wearing the fascinator&quot;. <br />
<br />
That was more than partially the truth. Liz was a very attractive woman for her age. Roger remembered the sexy red dress Liz had worn at her recent 50th birthday party and secretly lusted after the divorcee. There had been a time when Maureen had been equally as attractive but since having 3 kids she had &#39;let her body go&#39; and now looked every bit of her 51 years. He could never cheat on Maureen but did enjoy flirting with Liz. <br />
<br />
He was a bit taken aback when Liz replied &quot;That&#39;s a great idea! Why don&#39;t we go to the races! The cup is on in 3 weeks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clearly Maureen liked the idea as well and soon the ladies were discussing what they could wear. Roger took that as a cue to head back to his shed and let the woman get on with their chatter.<br />
<br />
It was only after Roger had departed that Maureen said &quot;Show me that note that came with your jewellery box Liz&quot; <br />
<br />
Liz had forgotten the ugly amulet in the box but now tipped it out onto the table. Maureen picked up the note and re-read it &quot;Do you think this could be real?&quot; she asked her friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well the amulet is ugly enough to be magical. Why else would you wear it?&quot; Liz tittered. &quot;It&#39;s actually quite heavy. I wonder what it&#39;s made of? Feel it&quot; She handed the amulet to Maureen<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch! You zapped me!&quot; said Maureen. &quot;It is heavy. But not heavy enough to be gold. My guess is it&#39;s just brass&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re probably right&quot;<br />
<br />
They put the amulet aside and went back to speculating about attending the races. &quot;So if we did go to the races are you likely to bring a partner? Or do we make it a girl&#39;s day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I need a break from the dating game. All my attempts in the last year have been disastrous. I think all the good men are taken. However I wouldn&#39;t want our day at the races to be girl&#39;s only. I want to see Roger the dodger all dressed up&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh give it up Liz. I know you enjoy teasing him&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just flirting. He&#39;s such a loyal puppy. He would never stray. You got a good one Maureen&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is. But I do wish I could lose some of this excess weight. Loyal or not I can&#39;t help but notice how he looks at you. He tries to hide it but he&#39;s hopeless. I wish he still looked at me with lust&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talking weight. Are you currently dieting? Your face looks slimmer&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m the heaviest I&#39;ve ever been. I need to lose 20 kg&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm..... Your hair! It&#39;s changing! You&#39;re turning red!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What! No.... Oh hell.... Liz you&#39;re changing as well. You&#39;re turning blonde....... Where&#39;s that note?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My God! It&#39;s real!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we are swapping bodies! The note says here &#39;If two people touch the medallion at the same time they will swap bodies!&#39; It&#39;s real! Look at you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick let&#39;s go to the bedroom! Bring that note and the amulet&quot;<br />
<br />
They did. Liz who was putting on weight rapidly took off her too tight jeans and top. Maureen was losing weight so wasn&#39;t in such a hurry but the dress she had been wearing now looked like a sack. She looked in the mirror as her hair lengthened and became Liz&#39;s red colour. Meanwhile Liz was becoming an overweight blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing!&quot; exclaimed Liz. &quot;Hell I think I just got your voice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And..... Yes I sound like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can change back can&#39;t we? Didn&#39;t it say something about 12 hours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who wants to change back? I think I&#39;ll enjoy being a hot redhead&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No offence Maureen but this is only temporary. Show me that note&quot;<br />
<br />
Maureen had bought the note to the bedroom and placed it on her bed. She handed it to Liz. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep 12 hours before we can swap back. We both touched it at the same time. So that means we will be like this until 10 pm. Look at the other things the note says the amulet can do. &#39;If you touch an unworn item of clothing it will make your body adapt to fit that clothing. If it has been worn it changes you into the last person to wear that clothing&#39; My God! The possibilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
By now Maureen had changed to 90% Liz. She got out of the dress she had been wearing. &quot;I think we need to swap clothes. This bra is now way to big for me and my panties won&#39;t stay up&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Won&#39;t Roger be in for a surprise! Here take these. They are way too tight for me at the moment&quot; She handed Maureen the bra and panties she had just taken off. Maureen looked at the lacy pink panties and matching bra. She wasn&#39;t interested in the disgustingly fat body Liz now had. That was the body she had wished away for the last 10 years. Now at least temporarily she had her wish. She put the underwear on which of course fitted her perfectly and admired her slim sexy figure. &quot;I think I came out ahead with this swap. This body is so sexy&quot; she admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. Give me your rings. I&#39;m now Mrs Roger Manning. That sound&#39;s pretty good to me&quot; Maureen handed Liz her wedding and engagement rings. Liz slipped them on to her now chubbier fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.... Do we tell him?&quot;</p>
