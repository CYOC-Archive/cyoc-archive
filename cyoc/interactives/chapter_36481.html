<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, when Ashley hid the note, the AC wasn't running in the part of the building.  She had know way of knowing that once the fans kicked on, the note would be blown around the building eventually floating out of one of the air vents... straight into the gym's locker room.<br />
<br />
However, as fate would have it, the room was not full of testosterone laced jocks for once.  All the athletes were long gone for the day, practice having ended some time ago.  However, one &quot;member&quot; of the team was still there, having a considerable amount of trouble getting his equipment off.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
John was the team mascot for &quot;The Fightin' Foxes!&quot;  While most people look down upon costumed mascots, John actually enjoyed the position.  It was fun to run out and act silly in front of so many people.  Even though almost all of the school knew who he was, he could still act in character as the school's mascot.<br />
<br />
However, the one part of the job that he hated was the suit's zipper.  It was almost impossible to undo with the costume's gloved paws.  He had worked up quite a sweat trying to get out of the suit already, and decided that he needed a quick breather.  Sitting down on the bench, he heard the 'crunch' of a sheet of paper being sat on.  Quickly standing up (his fake take swaying behind him), John picked up the sheet of paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some have school spirit, others do not.  Are you a fox?  Find out with our questionnaire!  A fair warning: Do not stop or something bad will happen, and don't lie!&quot;<br />
<br />
John scratched the top of his costumed head.  This must be one of the pep-rally fliers that he hadn't seen yet.  Picking up a discared pencil off the floor, John went down to the first question.<br />
<br />
Question 1) If you were a fox, what would your name be?<br />
<br />
John chuckled, that was an easy one.  The mascot's unofficial name had become Sly Fox over the years, so he wrote that down as his anwser, in a slightly bad handwriting.<br />
<br />
Question 2) If you were a fox, how old would you be?<br />
<br />
Another easy question, Sly was always played by a senior, so he scribbled down his own age of 18.<br />
<br />
Question 3) If you were a fox, how tall would you be?<br />
<br />
Sly scratched the end of his (fake) muzzle curiously.  None of these questions had anything to do with school spitit...  Hmm...  How tall would he be as a fox?  Well, foxes were small creatures, so even humanoid ones like him never got that tall.  He scribbled, &quot;Three foot tall and finished growing,&quot; then moved onto his next question.<br />
<br />
Question 4) If you were a fox,-<br />
<br />
Sly stopped, squirming a bit in his suit.  Man, this thing was suddenly really uncomfortable.  Reaching behind himself, he tried to find the zipper again.  Ah!  Finally!  There it was.  He slipped out of the mascot outfit carefully setting it down beside him on the bench.  He blushed a bit, sitting there naked out in the open.  However, everyone else was gone and he had a strange urge to finish the questionare.  Picking up his pencil, he went back to the- woah...  Had the locker room always been this big?  Things sure looked different from behind eyeholes.<br />
<br />
Question 4) If you were a fox, how big would your ears be?<br />
<br />
Sly thought about this for a moment.  He had always thought that the suit had big ears, huge ears even.  With a smile he wrote down, &quot;Unusually large ears for a fox.  My dad's a Fennec, hence why I'm so small.&quot;  As he progressed with the questionare, John failed to notice that his ears were growing substantially, gaining a furry brown coat.<br />
<br />
Question 5) If you were a fox, how many tails would you have?<br />
<br />
Sly laughed, scribbling down, &quot;Only one, but my grandfather swears his mother was half kitsune.&quot;  Sly shifted a bit on his seat, a long furry tail snaking out from his tailbone.<br />
<br />
Question 6) If you were a fox, what would your personality be like?<br />
<br />
Sly pondered this carefully, &quot;I'm rather shy.  As if being short with huge ears didn't paint enough of a target on me, my glasses don't help either.&quot;  Sly blinked as the page went a bit blurry.  Oh right...  Reaching next to him he picked up his glasses and continued, &quot;However, I've fallen in quite well with the more nerdy crowd in school.  They always get a kick out of my magic tricks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 7) If you were- wAM!<br />
<br />
Sly winced at the far off noise of someone dropping a textbook.  Oww... man, that hurt a lot more than it should...  He reached up to rub his ear gently, only to discover that the appendage was several inches higher than it should be, and was now sporting a thick fur coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yip!?  What in the world!?&quot;  He shouted, looking up at his head able to see the tips of his fennec ears.  &quot;Oh man oh man oh man...&quot;  He stood up, rushing over to a nearby mirror.  Oh man, everything was HUGE!  He... he was three feet tall!  And Yip!  He had a tail!  Everythign he had written down was true!!!<br />
<br />
Yip!  The note!  The note had done this to him!  He quickly padded over to the sheet of paper, holding it in his hands gently.  It was blank now, save for one phrase:<br />
<br />
&quot;Finish the quiz or else you will be stuck like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fat chance!  Holding the quiz in one hand, Sly stuck his other hand out, concentrating as slowly but surely a small ball of orange fire sprouted out of thin air.  Sly couldn't help but subconciously grin.  Fox Fire, his favorite &quot;Magic Trick&quot;.  In one swift motion, he burnt the quiz, hoping it would return him to normal.<br />
<br />
Wagging nervously, he brushed away the ashes, gently sitting down on the locker room bench.  He sat with his tail in his lap, praying it would go away.  He gulped gently, &quot;Yip... it's still here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he was met with yet another surprise.  Out of thin air, the note poofed back into exictance, straight into his hands.  It's writing had changed once more:<br />
<br />
&quot;You cannot get rid of me that easly Mr. Fox.  For that little stunt, I shall answer one of your questions for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 7) If you were a fox, what would you wear?<br />
<br />
Sly gulped, watching his own handwriting appear on the page.  &quot;Being part Fennec, I'm afraid that I'm easiliy domesticated.  My master insists that I wear nothing but the collar he gave me.  I have to admit though, it fits quite well.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Sly watched the words write themseles, he wagged terrified.  He could feel a worn piece of black leather snake it's way around his neck, a silver fastener holding it together.  A small metal jingling could be heard as his tag bumped up against the collar.  Gulp... he had tags too...<br />
<br />
Worse yet, when the naked fox/human looked over at the lost and found bin of abandoned gym clothes, he couldn't help but feel ashemed for even thinking about disobeying his Master's strict order.  Arf... at least his collar -did- fit well.  He looked down, just in time for him to see the next question appear.<br />
<br />
Question 8) What does your collar read Boy?<br />
<br />
The quiz's own use of the word boy sent a shiver down Sly's spine.  He was wearing nothing but a collar... and had a master...  Gulp, he hated to admit it, but he was quickly turning into some sort of pet.  His ears flopped down as he thought on how to answer the question.  Yip, most masters just put down the pet's name, their name, and their address.  Well, at least the quiz was letting him choose who his knew owner was going to be...  Picking up the pencil, he began to write.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sly Fox...&quot;</p>
