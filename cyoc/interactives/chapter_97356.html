<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William slowly made his way up the stairs to get ready to go to bed after a relatively long day. It had started rather well with his bond as a werefox to Martha created hope for real healing in their marriage, and they did renew their agreement to try and heal everything. He was formally welcomed into the werefox community within Moon Lake with Martha being made an honorary member as well, and he could feel pride at Nate getting what he&#39;d probably wanted since he&#39;d seen &quot;American Werewolf in London&quot; on the SciFi channel back in Minnesota. And Yvette was in jail and he wouldn&#39;t have to deal with her until the trial, and then the mayor called Samantha before they could leave Austin&#39;s home to let Nate enjoy his change in species, and they learned that Yvette had escaped police custody.<br />
<br />
Once on the second floor he walked quietly along until he came to Eric&#39;s bedroom door and looked in. His son lay quietly on his side and was sleeping peacefully. He looked calm and peaceful and even at home in a way. That did ease some of his fears, as William knew that his and Martha&#39;s questions over Moon Lake were rapidly answered and erased by their respective transformations, and the conditions of William&#39;s own transformation into a werefox had to have only frightened Eric and only increased his son&#39;s fears. They&#39;d seemed eased by the time the Andersons and the Twists had dinner to celebrate Nate&#39;s journey to become a werewolf, and even more so when he and Martha showed their younger son what their were forms looked like. That healing and innocence had to be protected and he couldn&#39;t let Yvette come back and hurt his son. He, Martha, the Twists, Ben, and Nate could fight Yvette off, Eric couldn&#39;t. He wouldn&#39;t be strong enough, and if Yvette clawed him, he&#39;d be forced to change just as William had been forced to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;He look&#39;s peaceful,&quot; as he picked up the scent of werecat approaching in the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha whispered to him and nuzzled his cheek with her feline muzzle.<br />
<br />
William looked over to see that Martha had returned to her werecat form. In that form, her height had grown slightly so that she stood as tall as he did on her digitigrade feet and her paws allowing her to move practically silently. She wrapped one arm around William&#39;s back and focused her green slit pupil eyes to their sleeping son.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is peaceful,&quot; Martha said softly, &quot;and while it&#39;ll take some work... paying attention... and help from friends... he&#39;ll stay peaceful and that vixen will be out of our fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s let him sleep and go to the bedroom,&quot; Martha whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; William nodded and backed away, &quot;It has been a long day...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha ushered William back and the two of them returned to their bedroom. It had been a long day, but in a way she still felt a great deal of energy. She wasn&#39;t sure if that was the coffee they had drunk while talking over how protect Eric and their other plans or if it was the fact that she was in heat thanks to her transition from normal human to werecat. She had detected that in herself throughout the day and even through the conversation. She knew that William could smell her scent as he periodically became slightly aroused by it, but lost the arousal over his worries for Eric&#39;s safety. The brief scent of arousal was enough to even make her feel slightly warm between her legs that had nothing to do her being in heat.<br />
<br />
Neither of them turned the light on as they entered the bed room, letting the soft lighting of the moon come through the bedroom windows. Her green cat eyes easily could see everything in the room as William walked toward the laundry chute taking off his shirt as he did so. He gave her a full view of his back and well toned muscle. It wasn&#39;t huge or massively developed, but well toned for a man of William&#39;s height which made him look rather sexy as a werefox. That increased the growing arousal that she felt as she began to take off her own shirt.<br />
<br />
William calmly walked over to the laundry chute and dropped his shirt into it. He then began unbuttoning his pants and pulling them down to take them off. After stepping out of them, he left them up and gave them a quick sniff test. They didn&#39;t smell too bad and he could actually still pick up what remained of the detergent that had been used the last time the pants had been washed. It continued to amaze him on how good his senses has grown. He took a step to a side to set the pants on the back of a desk chair near the bed he normally shared with Martha. As he did so he began to pick up a scent of arousal, and it wasn&#39;t his. He then turned to see Martha approaching the laundry chute as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you like what you see,&quot; William teased to her, though he felt his own member rise a little at the sight of his werecat wife.<br />
<br />
Her brown furred breasts were presently stuffed into a bra that looked a size or two too small on her. It enhanced her cleavage and the portion her breasts that was outside the confinement of the bra curved up and out a little to make up for the confinement the bra put on them. And that served to get a rise out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Martha smiled as she tossed her shirt down the chute and reached behind herself to begin wrestling with the clasps on her bra, &quot;and I think you see something you like too.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that she got her bra unclasped and her bosom bounced slightly as it was freed from its fabric prison. Her nipples were perky and clearly erect as they poked through her fur. William gave a weak smile as he felt his penis begin to form a tent in his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you need a new bra,&quot; William gave a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I KNOW I need a new bra,&quot; Martha chuckled as she dropped her bra down the chute and playfully running her tail under William&#39;s chin, &quot;I need several new bras... I need BIGGER bras now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha looked down as she began to pull down her sweatpants and could see as William&#39;s penis was not only becoming erect in his underwear but was growing too big to be contained by it. And this began fulfill some of the sexual curiosity she had earlier as to see how big William was now as a werefox. He was clearly bigger than he was as a human, and it continued to grow larger still. They had agreed to take it slow, but William&#39;s drive to protect his son was endearing to her and his erection was only serving to increase her own arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;All part of the secondary effects of being a were,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;My butt is firmer... a bit bigger than it was... my hips are wider... and by breasts are bigger and firmer and MORE sensitive... your muscles gained more definition and your penis has more than doubled in size...&quot;<br />
<br />
William only looked down to see how his erection was pushing the waistband of his underwear forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;That it has,&quot; William chuckled as Martha approached him and he felt her paw like hands gently beginning to pull down his underwear. He also noticed a familiar look in her eyes. &quot;I thought were were going to take it slow...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha only smiled as she felt William&#39;s hands rest on her hips and then slowly moved to actually rub against the base of her tail, and the soft touch only further aroused her from the touch. Even without his fur, it was a sensual touch that felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are going slow,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;but we are were-beasts... slow for us... is fast for normals.&quot;<br />
<br />
William felt himself nod as his underwear fell to the floor and he stepped out of them and Martha pushed her body against his. Her soft fur tickled him slightly and did plenty to stimulate his penis as it was pressed between Martha&#39;s body and his. He rubbed his fingers into the side of her panties and began to pull them down. They felt a bit tight on her body, as though the swell of her hips had strained the garment&#39;s material to nearly its limit before it would be pulled apart at the seems.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might need a slightly larger pair of panties to fit your new sexy hips,&quot; William said to her as he kissed the sides of her muzzle, actually relishing the touch of her fur on his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already figured that out,&quot; Martha laughed and nuzzled him back and moved to grip William&#39;s now well toned butt, &quot;but this will be so much better when my FOX is with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can easily arrange for that,&quot; William smiled as his eyes immediately shifted from brown to red and his pupil became a vertical slit, not that different from Martha&#39;s own cat eyes. The biggest difference was in their color.<br />
<br />
Martha purred in excitement as William&#39;s nose turned black and his face began to push out into the pointed muzzle of a fox complete with the sharp teeth that went with it. His hair remained the same color, but grew slightly longer as red orange fur grew out on his face and the top of his muzzle. That same fur also began to grow out over much the rest of his body. White fur grew out on the sides of his muzzle and went down his neck and chest and went all the way down to his inner thighs. Between his legs, a sheath had wrapped around the base of his penis, which had throbbed larger still and there was now a swelling at its base, the knot that would tie them together at sexual climax. Black fur grew out on his hands, forearms, feet, and the lower part of legs which gave William the look as if he were wearing black gloves and socks. Only stubby claws on his fingers and toes put aside that look. <br />
<br />
William was soon softly stroking Martha&#39;s body as he sat back onto the bed and groomed her fur with his claws, softly caressing her breasts and playfully flicking at her nipples and then working his way down to her but and the wet juncture between her legs. He again caressed the base of her tail and rubbed at her twitching clit. William had never been a bad lover in bed, but as much as he might have liked to think that he was... he was never a great lover before, either. Once they got going he had been good, but his skills at foreplay weren&#39;t that good... but now, as a werefox, it was like William was a master. Every touch was soft and in just the right places and served to delight Martha greatly. And as William moved to softly nibble on one of her nipples, and as his long tail with its fluffy red orange fur and white furred tip grew out behind him, he brought Martha to a full orgasm before even getting his penis into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh.... ooooohhhhhh God... yesssssss,&quot; Martha moaned, &quot;Darling... I&#39;m MORE than ready for you.<br />
<br />
Martha lifted herself up for a moment to place herself above William&#39;s fully erect penis. It was huge and Martha thought to herself that male porn stars could only wish to be as big as William was now, and a part of her mind figured that if Nate grew even bigger as a werewolf, he would make some woman VERY happy. But her focus was more on her own pleasure. She new that she could fit around him almost instinctively and pressed her chest into William&#39;s as she lowered herself onto her husband&#39;s huge member. She practically felt as if she was in heaven as her vagina wrapped around it and as William softly gripped her but with a finger rubbing at the base of her tail to help her thrust into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh... you... you... you&#39;rrrrre... soooooooooouuuuhhhhhhh... tiiiiiiiiight,&quot; William moaned as he began to thrust into Martha. The strength of of her vagina was such that he could feel his penis begin to twitch inside her almost immediately and sent shockwaves of pleasure through him, and in his mind, he felt his bond to Martha grow stronger. She looked happy, she was with him, she was beautiful and sexier than she had ever been before... though his fox also wondered if that was possible.<br />
<br />
He leaned up to lick at Martha&#39;s other nipple and continued to thrust into her, and Martha found herself mewing in trembling pleasure as she came again. Her transformation had been wonderful and been the greatest sex she had had up until that point, but as she felt her vagina to begin to stretch further and William&#39;s knot began to penetrate her, she put what she was enjoying now on par with what Frances and Samantha had given her the night before. It made her feel overjoyed to have such good lovers and a part of her wondered further on how they would arrange the plan that would allow her enjoy both joys of her bisexual nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... ohhhhhh... oohhhhhhhhh Gooooaaaawwwwwwwddduuuuuhhhhh... you&#39;re... HUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGE!&quot; Martha cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;The better... toooo looooooooovvvvve you... oooohhhhhh,&quot; William couldn&#39;t even finish the moan as Martha came again and his knot made full penetration and he felt himself erupt inside her.<br />
<br />
With that, the two of them collapsed back onto the bed, breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that was the best sex WE&#39;VE ever had,&quot; Martha said to him between breaths, and thankful for the birth control pills she&#39;d taken. She did want a daughter, but given the high fertility levels were-beasts had, their lengthy life spans, that while females had heat cycles they went in a more human like breeding cycle... once a month and would come again the month after giving birth, and that since were-beasts had such high sexual libidos, it was entirely possible that without taking those pills, she could find herself the mother of twenty children in twenty years, and probably more than that if a were-beast&#39;s gestation period was still nine months.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I trust I was pleasing to you,&quot; William said slowly.<br />
<br />
Martha smiled and nuzzled him, &quot;Oh yes you were... do you feel better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strangely... yes,&quot; William hugged her and then moved to roll further onto the bed. Martha found herself rolling with him as he did so. She briefly tried to pull off him, but found her vagina tightly gripping William&#39;s knot, which hadn&#39;t deflated yet. &quot;And while we may have plenty to do make sure Eric stays safe... I&#39;d think that you and I will have plenty of opportunity be happy and relieve stress... and if we get enough whipped cream, I have some ideas you could try with the Twists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooohhhh!&quot; Martha mewed with a smile, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to hear... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that she finally yawned, &quot;that&#39;ll have to wait until tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
William yawned in response and nodded and the two of them drifted into sleep still tied together and the bonds of mateship between them growing even stronger.</p>
