<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of Martha’s week went by without anything interesting happening. She had continued her job hunt with no luck and had gone on a date setup through a dating app that lead to an awkward dinner and a relieved good bye. It was now Saturday and her next test was in an hour. After putting on one of the more looser fitting panties she had bought Martha left for Ero-Tech labs. Lucky for her she actually lived rather close to the lab and her drive was only 15 minutes long. She arrived with time to spare and went to the lobby to wait. As she walked in Martha saw a familiar face sitting on the lobby couches. Raven was sitting there in a large hoodie looking nervous. The first time Martha had seen Raven she had thought he was a girl because of the breasts that his test had given him, but now looking at him Martha could not see any sign of his breasts. Martha then sat next to him and asked him how his week went and what happened to his chest. He told her that the first thing he did after the test was get a breast binder wrap which made him look mostly normal. He had then tried to keep the fact that he had accidentally gotten breasts a secret from his girlfriend June but that didn’t last long. Luckily for him June though that he looked extra sexy like this and promised to help him if they grew larger. What he was worried about now was how his family would react when he saw them for Easter in a two weeks. They continued to chat for a few more minutes until they were each called for their test.<br />
<br />
Martha was now back in the testing room with the lotion bottle sitting on the table. Before starting the test, she was asked if she would still participate in the breast augmentation lotion experiment as well, since she signed the contract, saying she would receive double payment if she participated in both experiments at once. She accepted the proposal, so they placed a second lotion next to the first saying that it should be applied to her breasts. She used her left hand to apply the breast augmentation lotion to her breasts, meanwhile she used her other hand to apply the penis enlargement lotion to her cock. Just like the first time she stroked her cock, which got hard and grew slowly as she jerked off. She also massaged her breasts, in the process she noticed that her nipples were harder and felt longer than normal, and continued to get longer and longer. She just tried to ignore it believing that it should be something natural since her breasts should be getting bigger, but she could no longer ignore when she felt two lumps that appeared below each nipple. She looked at her own breasts and realized that her nipples had changed shape and acquired a collindrical shape that she recognized immediately, realizing that they had become dicks, each with a ballsack underneath. Despite the strange situation, Martha continued to stroke her dicks. Soon she felt that she was going to come, but this time she had the same feeling in her breasts, coming and cum came out of her dick and dicknipples.<br />
<br />
After Martha was done, she analyzed what had happened to her and saw that the dick between her legs had doubled in size and should now be at least 8 inches, her breasts had grown from her C-cup to E-cup, the most striking were the dicks that occupied the place where her nipples used to be, each at least 3 and a half inches long and with their own ballsack hanging just below. The female voice spoke again from the lab speaker, saying that probably the accidental application of the penis enlargement lotion on her breasts in the first test had probably caused a mutation and were responsible for her nipples becoming dicks.<br />
<br />
Martha then dressed, her panties now becoming painfully tight, forcing her to go without. With her bra it was worse, with her bigger breasts they were already too tight and with the dicks and balls there it was simply impossible to wear, so she just decided not to wear her underwear. Now the bulge between her legs was noticeable, but not as much as the bulge of the genitals on her breasts created on her blouse.<br />
<br />
When she was released to go home the project&#39;s chief scientist said to her &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we will study exactly what happened and resolve it as soon as possible.&quot; She understood the situation well and decided to trust them and after saying goodbye she left.<br />
<br />
Martha got in her car that was in the lab&#39;s parking lot, but stood there thinking about how she was going to do it now, because her new members had grown too big to hide, even from her son. She realized then that she was even enjoying the changes that happened to her. Soon she realized she was hungry and started the car thinking about looking for a restaurant to eat, but she saw Raven coming out of the lab. She saw that he seemed to be discouraged, so she called him and invited him to lunch with her, which he accepted. On the way to the restaurant Martha asked Raven why he was so discouraged and he said it was because .....</p>
