<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Mike felt like they where surrounded which they where as the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the generals of the legions of hell surrounded them. Watching from the distance was their best friend who was now the Princess of Hell and Hell now ruled Earth.<br />
“So who wants…” started the Horseman or rather Horsewoman of War as she caused both young men to look at her. <br />
“I’ll take this one.” said a deep low voice from behind as both of them turned to see the black hooded figure with a large scythe standing right in front of Mike. Mike wasn’t that tall of a young man, he was almost as round as he was tall so the Horsemen of Death was bent over to look him straight in the eye. <br />
Mike was speechless as he looked into those dark eyes…wait how did he know the eyes where black? It was a faceless creature before him.<br />
“No…” said Mike shaking his head, which hurt to no end. This was Barasty the Horsemen of Death and the right hand general of King Lucifer. Mike shook his head again as the image of a pale bald man with impossibly dark eyes entered his mind, along with the image of a breath taking beautiful demoness with black batlike wings, smooth silver horns and silver eyes. <br />
“Morri.” Said Mike his voice sounding different as he lifted his head up. That was the name of the demoness…<br />
Watching in horror was his friend Jeff, Mike’s changes where rapid, his arm which had been in a sling was now fully healed but it was becoming slender as Mike grew in height. He had always been a short guy, but he had gained at least a foot in length. <br />
“Yes…Morri, your mother.” answered Barasty as he stopped crouching down and stood tall as Mike now stood taller then Jeff. His fat was also burning away as he started to gain muscles. However not all the fat was burning away, some was moving toward his chest and ass. “Your mother is going to love you…my daughter.”<br />
“Daughter…” said Mike as he tried to fight the magic, but he was losing. <br />
Of course, she was the daughter of Princess Morri, sister to King Lucifer and cousin to her best friend the future Queen of this world Deonna. <br />
“No…” said Mike his voice sounding musical as his short brown hair turned an impossible silk smooth black which began to grow rapidly down to his but. <br />
He always liked long hair on a woman, so that is why she had it. It felt right to have long hair but it did get in the way sometimes, but it was worth it. His already pale skin still remained pale in fact turned paler but also became silk smooth as his neck legated as he quickly was becoming a she.<br />
“I am a man, I love women, I love sexy busty women with perfect asses and long hair.” Thought Mike as a new voice, a voice he knew belong to him spoke up.<br />
“I am a demoness; I love men and women and I am a sexy busty demoness with a perfect ass and long dark hair.” Said the voice as an image of what he was becoming filled his mind. He tried to fight it but he began to feel so good, so powerful.<br />
Mike opened his eyes, his eyes had changed to an impossible black as she turned and looked at Jeff. Jeff then knew that his friend was gone, replaced by this sexy busty demoness. Then the demoness turned back to the Lord of Death.<br />
“Father.” said Mike in a smooth voice as the changes speed up now that Mike wasn’t fighting it. The demoness legs elongated as long 9 in tale heels appeared replacing the tennis shoes he had been wearing. His blue jeans chanced into a short black skirt with long black fishnet stockings, the t-shirt changed into a black leather corset with open shoulders and back. Black finger nail polish appeared on each of her fingers and toes. Her lushes lips turned black and for a moment Jeff saw Mike as the most sexy goth girl he had ever seen. Then with a burst two silver horns appeared out of the side of his head and curved upwards as two bat like wings came out of her back, however these wings where bone like with some shreds of flesh on it. <br />
“Thank you, father,…” said Mike his voice sexy as she hugged Death and Death hugged her back. “Thank you for making me.”<br />
“It is my pleasure my child.” said Death “I will name you…Mania.”<br />
“Thank you, father.” said the newly named Mania as Deonna formerly Dale moved forward and hugged her new cousin. <br />
“You look so beautiful…so sexy.” said Deonna pulling back to look at her. “And we are cousins…I can’t wait to have so much fun with you.” <br />
“Thank you, Princess, but I am nothing compared to you.” Said Mania as Jeff looked back and forth between his two friends now turned demoness. Deonna was taller and had a smaller chest but prefect for her frame while Mania while taller then Mike had been was shorter then Deonna but had a larger bust. If it wasn’t the fact that they were demons, they would be among the hottest women he had ever seen but he had more concerns then that.<br />
“Well Princess, we can’t have fun until our friend Jeff has joined us.” said Mania showing off her new set of fangs in a smile.<br />
&quot;So who wants to claim him?&quot; inquired Lucifer<br />
&quot;I will.&quot; answered a voice.</p>
