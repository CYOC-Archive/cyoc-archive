<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After all the weirdness of alternate timelines and inter dimensional doppelgängers Kellie was happy to find things were finally beginning to quiet down.<br />
<br />
Although the threat of Morgan La Fay was still present the girls had found themselves adjusting to their new reality. Kellie continued to build friendships with Katie and the others while Mary Elise and Karen remained peaceful with them, going so far as to actually go to Claudia’s house and apologize for the fight that had happened so many years ago. What truely astounded Kellie though was the changes in Lisa and Kumiko.<br />
<br />
Lisa appeared to be working very hard on maintaining her temper. Kellie noticed how the girl seemed to be quieter lately, focusing on school and volleyball. The fiery red head had even gone so far as to begin rebuilding her relationship with Ann. Katie and Kellie were both astounded as they saw Lisa sitting down with Ann to just talk. Kumikos changes were even more astounding  than Lisa’s though.<br />
<br />
The rebellious Asian teen had begun studying harder than ever before, realizing that she would need good grades if she were to follow in her adult selves footsteps. Kellie was shocked when Mika told her how Kumiko had recently aced every exam she had taken, if it continued the average student would quickly find herself towards the top of the class.<br />
<br />
“My parents are thrilled and a little worrried,” Mika joked. “Kumi has never tried this hard at school before. They’re starting to wonder if this is just an evil clone.”<br />
<br />
“No but there’s probably one out there,” Kellie laughed.<br />
<br />
“One problem though,” Mika added to which Kellie immediately gave a worried look. “What is it, what’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
Mika smirked as she now looked at the honey haired teen. “She keeps asking Claudia to give Cole her cell phone number.”<br />
<br />
As school ended Kellie found herself driving home. Today was going to be fun as Mary Elise was coming over to her house. Kellie had asked the sullen redhead if she would like to come over to talk magic and try to get to know each other a little better. Although at first unsure Mary Elise eventually agreed, the idea of becoming more proficient with Magic was hard to passed out.<br />
<br />
As the two teens walked through the front door Merlin looked up from his book. “Hello Kellie how was school,” Kellie smiled as she held the door for Mary. Merlin frowned as he now slowly stood. “I see you have company,” he stated. “Will she be staying?”<br />
<br />
“Relax Merlin Mary’s fine,” Kellie sighed. “And yeah I think Mary will be staying for dinner.” Althohh Merlin continued to look Mary over icily he eventually smiled. “Well we would be happy to have her over,” he said. “Hope you like roast chicken.”<br />
<br />
Before Mary could answer Kellie grabbed her hand, quickly leading her upstairs. As the two entered the room Mary looked nervously around. “Your room is kinda bland,” she commented quietly as she looked at the bed, desk and chair that occupied the room. “Yeah I’ve never been big on decorations,” Kellie said quickly. “By the way sorry about Merlin, he’s still a little wary of you...seeing that that ring of yours came from Morgan La Fay.”<br />
<br />
“Probably partly my fault,”Mary said quietly. “I didn’t exactly make the best first impressions. Which reminds me what was with the invite?”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she now sat Indian style on the floor. “Glad you asked,” she smiled. “I wanted to know what kind of transformations you’ve done.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Mary thought. “There was Jason’s friend that I turned into a donkey, I accidentally almost turned me and Karen into mice, Samantha, and lately I’ve been practicing turning some old stuffed animals into actual animals.”<br />
<br />
“Impressive,” Kellie said thoughtfully. “Glad that your practicing. That’s why your here today.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise gaped at Kellie as the honey haired teen continued to grin. “Listen Mary,” Kellie grinned. “You’ve done some transformations but you need some more practice. Actually I could use some practice too but you go first.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise gaped at Kellie as she tried to process what Kellie was saying. “Won’t Merlin get upset,” she asked nervously. Kellie laughed quietly, taking Mary’s hand in hers to reassure her. “No he’ll be okay,” she said. “The things were doing are just parlor tricks to an inter dimensional magical being like him. No matter what happens, nothing will get to the point that it can’t be fixed. Trust me, this is safe.”<br />
<br />
“O..okay,” Mary said nervously. “So..what are we going to do?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Kellie mused, an impish smirk crossing her face. “I want you to try an shrink me.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise gaped at Kellie before looking down at her ring. “I..ive never even tried that,” she whispered. Kellie smiled squeezing Mary’s hand reassuringly. “I figured you hadn’t,” she said calmly. “But...you do have a ring of transformation, this should be one of the powers at your disposal. You should probably practice these skills if your going to be a ring bearer. I want you to be able to control this power without making any universe altering mistakes. This is the safest place we can try this.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise nodded as she stared at her ring. “Okay,” she sighed. “I’ll try, but I don’t even know how I would begin trying to shrink you.”<br />
<br />
“”What I want you to do is to close your eyes and picture me in your mind. After you do that I want you to focus on making that picture of me smaller. After that the ring should do the rest.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise sighed, closing her eyes she now pictured Kellie in front of her. Slowly now she tried to picture the teen gradually growing smaller. A tingling sensation ran through her body letting her know that the ring was beginning to work.<br />
<br />
Kellie waited patiently as she watched Mary Elise concentrate. After a few seconds she felt an odd feeling beginning to envelope her body. Looking down at her hands she noticed the cuffs of her sleeves slowly inching forward on her hands. “Your doing it Mary keep going.”<br />
<br />
Kellie shifted slightly as she felt her clothing slowly but surely become loose on her body. The girl normally stood around 5’6” but realized she was now a couple inches short of that mark. Kellies clothing felt slightly baggy on her frame as she slowly grew smaller. Looking at her feet’s she could feel her sneakers beginning to become roomier as her foot grew smaller. Rolling her sleeve up she conntinued urging Mary on telling her to concentrate.<br />
<br />
Kellie continued to smile as she looked herself over. Her clothing was going from slightly baggy to oversized. As she adjusted her bra she could feel the cups no longer cupping her breasts as they’d once did as they grew smaller. Looking at her hands she could see the cuffs were gradually sliding down, now resting around her thumb. “I’m probably only five feet tall now,” she thought. Kellie smiled as she watched the girl conntinue to concentrate. Today was gong to be a fun day of magical training.</p>
