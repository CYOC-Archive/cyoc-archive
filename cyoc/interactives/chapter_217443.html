<br />
Now convinced that you were desperate to be changed, you were far too reckless in not telling Rose what exactly you wanted to be changed into. Part of you realized this but the rest simply didn&#39;t care, it was way more hot to just let it happen to you, and Rose wouldn&#39;t do anything you wouldn&#39;t like, you trusted her too much to suspect that sort of thing. Of course, if she hadn&#39;t just changed your mind to make you think you were best friends and trust her implicitly, you&#39;d realize what a bad idea this was. As it was, you were a clueless toy for her to play with, but she at least promised herself you&#39;d things when she was done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then,&quot; Rose began fiddling the flashlight in her hand idly as she looked you over. &quot;You&#39;re gonna close your eyes and you&#39;re not gonna open them until I tell you to, I don&#39;t want any distractions while I work on my masterpiece.&quot; She said, only half joking with the last part from the sounds of it. &quot;Seriously though, eyes shut.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dutifully, you closed your eyes, mind swirling with the possibilities of what you might become, unaware that she was intending to change your mind as well. Still, it&#39;s not like you&#39;d be able to complain when she was done, after all, the fact that you wouldn&#39;t remember your old life was the most exciting part to you. You shivered with excitement as you waited, hoping that she&#39;d start any second now, you were about to complain when you heard the soft &#39;click&#39; of the light being turned on.<br />
<br />
You felt a slight warmth on your core as she presumably set to work, doing your best to control your breathing despite your excitement. Occasionally you feel a slight twinge or tickle across your form though thanks to the flashlight&#39;s odd side effects it was impossible to tell just what was changing. That was totally part of it for you though, the fact that the anticipation would never really end since you were going to almost instantly adjust your memories to your new form and life when she was done.<br />
<br />
Almost as if she was predicting your thoughts, Rose spoke up, sounding surprisingly loud for some reason. &quot;Now then, you&#39;re gonna remember a different life and all that, but if you ask nice I&#39;m ready to give you a few hints about the old you.&quot; She offered with a snicker, seeming far to amused with the position of power this situation had put her in.<br />
<br />
It felt like a small eternity of waiting before you finally heard her break the silence, &quot;Alright, eyes open you&#39;ve got something to see.&quot; <br />
<br />
You look down at your body, unable to tell what&#39;s changed and feeling slightly confused by that despite all your mental preparation. Looking over a sandy furred arm you tried to remember what you used to be like, but you knew it was a lost cause, smiling a toothy smile you went over what you remembered.<br />
<br />
You were a sandy furred fennec fox, a short and peppy one by the name of &#39;Kit&#39;, the name wasn&#39;t exactly manly, but then again neither were you. You remembered going through your teenage years with confusing thoughts about the other boys, never quite fitting in both because of your species and rather diminutive size but also because you were, despite your best efforts, relentlessly gay. You remembered your first rejection from your best friend and you remembered crying yourself to sleep that night while hugging your pillow. You remembered your first date, with both of you in the closet and pretending to just be friends things didn&#39;t last long.<br />
<br />
Then, when you&#39;d graduated and met Rose you&#39;d finally come into your own; it started with her convincing you to buy clothes you actually liked, like the cute soft pink shorts, white crop top and pastel blue hoodie you were wearing now. After a while though, she had you fully out of the closet and never willing to go back, you were a gay little mess but you were her gay little mess. You remembered dating a friend of hers, waking up in his bed the next day and learning what you and Rose had always secretly suspected, you were a total bottom. You remembered her teasing you endlessly for having a girlier ass and hips than her, and constantly toying with your oversized ears and tail to bug with you... and, you remembered something else too...<br />
<br />
As if on cue, you heard a snicker from the vixen. You remembered you&#39;d let her change you with that weird flashlight the pair of you had found, but for the life of you, you couldn&#39;t remember what. &quot;Trying to figure it out?&quot; She asked, smirking slightly, ugh, she was such a bitch but it was so fun to be around her. &quot;I can tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
That offer gave you pause for a second, you felt like you after all, you remembered being you. While you didn&#39;t want to change that, you just had to know... &quot;I uh, maybe that&#39;d be best.&quot; You admitted with a cute giggle in your soft, almost singsongy voice. You were nervous, but in the end, you liked being you, you were just curious.<br />
<br />
Rose quickly covered up for a mischievous smirk as she decided to lie rather than tell you the truth. &quot;You were a built wolf, hunky and all that but it totally went against your whole sub vibe.&quot; She teased, loving that you would never know you&#39;d started as a fully straight human. &quot;I promised to do all this so you can live the life you were supposed to, tiny, adorable, finally able to fit into all those cute clothes you&#39;ve always wanted. I could always change you back if you want though...&quot;<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t really able to remember any of that, but it at least sounded true, after all, what else would she have changed. You really did remember being a closeted, gay anthro after all, but it wasn&#39;t too hard to believe that things were different as far as your build and species went. &quot;No way, this feels perfect!&quot; You assured, thinking on how much this body felt like you, obliviously sealing your fate and earning a laugh from Rose, though you foolishly assumed it was just her feeling happy for you.</p>
