<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coral scrolled through the profiles again, wondering what else she could change before they got home. She was sure Adam would want to be turned back into his original 15 year old self, but decided he could wait a little longer and really experience what it was like to be the younger sibling. He actually wasn&#39;t complaining nearly as much as she thought he would, and that had her thinking about how the magic affected reality, even when one was aware of the changes. The whole world really had adjusted itself to make Adam-as-a-5-year-old seem to have been the way things always were, and even though she KNEW he&#39;d once been 15 and older than her, it felt completely... correct, right and normal that he was her younger brother and she was 5 years older than him. She realized she even had faint memories of when her parents had brought him home from the hospital and she got to meet her sibling for the first time!<br />
<br />
Along with always wondering what it would be like to be the older one, Coral had also often wished she could be the older BROTHER, and as she gazed down at the controller in her hands, she realized that now she could actually find out what that would be like! Not just a like a &#39;tomboy,&#39; but as an actual BOY!<br />
<br />
She quickly pulled up her profile and selected the gender option, dropping down the bar and toggling from FEMALE to MALE. She left her height and weight for now, too excited to wait and contemplate complementary changes right now. Quickly hitting SUBMIT CHANGES, it was only as she felt a flush consume her body, centering in her stomach and groin that she realized she&#39;d left the overall settings the same as when she&#39;d changed their mum&#39;s hair color. In only 5 seconds Coral&#39;s organs had rearranged and dissolved, new parts growing slightly within her jeans and panties but with only a slight change in bone structure around her jaw, practically unnoticeable underneath her remaining adolescent &#39;baby fat.&#39;<br />
<br />
Her hair and everything else seemed to have remained the same, and she realized that Adam didn&#39;t even know she&#39;d done anything when he leaned over and whispered &quot;So what should we change next, Sis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, maybe... how about we just wait until we get home to fiddle with anything else, okay?&quot; she even sounded the same, and Coral realized that at 10, she hadn&#39;t started puberty and the male version of her was still pretty similar to her female self. Adam couldn&#39;t see any visual changes and her green t-shirt and jeans had remained the same, so he didn&#39;t KNOW she&#39;d changed anything yet.<br />
<br />
As they pulled up to the house, Katherine told the kids to head upstairs and put their new school clothes in the hamper to be washed. &quot;You can have a few hours of free time before dinner if you want to play with your new toys, but no fighting! I&#39;ll see what your father is making for dinner and let you know when it&#39;s time to set the table.&quot; She unbuckled Adam and helped him down, handing him a small bag to carry inside. The boys had been getting along so well today that she&#39;d almost left the part off about fighting, but they were so often squabbling over space and objects that it had just tumbled out by habit.<br />
<br />
Coral ran upstairs, quickly outpacing Adam on his shorter legs. When she got to her room she yelled back to him from the doorway &quot;I&#39;ll come down to your room in a minute, bro! Just want to put these away like mom said!&quot; she slumped against the door as it clicked shut, looking down at her jeans and wondering what she&#39;d find inside. A little too afraid to start there, she lifted her gaze, wondering if she&#39;d notice any changes to her room. Her shock was instantaneous: while she&#39;d never been a girly-girl, Coral had collected a LOT of stuffed animals, many of which had been pink and purple. An elaborate dollhouse had been in the corner of her room at the foot of her twin bed, but now she spied a short blue bookcase in its place, the shelves lined with hotwheels and toy cars of all different makes and models. Somehow she knew what each one was, and even had memories of collecting them over the years. Her bed still had a bunch of stuffed animals, but now there were more tigers, foxes and bears in natural colors with a few old, well-loved dinosaur stuffies mixed in. She had a flash thought that Adam would love some of those, since he was so into dinosaurs at the moment, but she hadn&#39;t been able to part with her oldest &#39;friends&#39; no matter how much he&#39;d begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; she muttered. &quot;I&#39;m a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She spied some papers on her desk, along with a football trophy with a plaque at the bottom. Picking it up, she read the inscription. <br />
&#39;Second Place Overall - Mavericks - Carlisle Youth Summer Football League&#39; and memories of games and practices with her team over the past summer flooded back. Second place had been disappointing, but they&#39;d had a ton of fun on the pitch, especially at the pool party at Denny&#39;s house at the end of the season!<br />
<br />
&quot;Incredible&quot; Coral breathed, putting the trophy down. &quot;Memories and everything... I wonder if Adam is having them too, or still doesn&#39;t know I changed myself into his brother?&quot;</p>
