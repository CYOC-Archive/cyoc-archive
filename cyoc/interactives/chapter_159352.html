<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you open it, you hear the sound of birds fluttering away, and the light dims as a cloud comes over the sun.  You see black cloth.  Clothes?  On top is another letter:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear David,<br />
<br />
Congratulations on opening the box!  What the box itself will do from now on is anyone&#39;s guess, but our second gift to you is more predictable.  These are the robes of a wizard.  If you put them on they will begin to draw magic to you. Furthermore there is a map in the bottom of the box that will lead you to Atlantis, where you may find training.  Without proper training it would be dangerous to use more than very minor magic, so we would recommend not wearing the robes more than once a month so as to prevent too much magic from accumulating in your body and getting out of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pick up the black cloth, but as you do so something is wrong.  These aren&#39;t wizard robes at all!  In fact, this looks like a very low cut and short length women&#39;s black dress!  The other contents of the box confirm it: black panties and a bra!  and they were very lacey, sexy underwear too. There were also a pair of heels, and what looked like a witch&#39;s hat. Was this some sort of mistake or a terrible joke?  You sigh and put it back.  No way were you putting that on.<br />
<br />
...right?  <br />
<br />
You look back at the dress.  Suddenly you...want to. It&#39;s an embarrassing thought but an exciting one.  Cross dressing had never really occurred to you before but now you kinda want to. But no, it&#39;s absurd.  You&#39;d look ridiculous in it.<br />
<br />
Then again...what if it was magic, though?  I mean maybe the wizards just had some sort of shipping error and sent you a female uniform by mistake, but it was still magical?  I mean, no one had to see you wearing it, and if it let you do magic...<br />
<br />
You hope your face isn&#39;t red as you pull out the dress.  You strip down to your boxers...and realize you&#39;re quickly developing a hard on.  Welp, apparently there was no denying that this was hot to you.  You figure in for a penny, in for a pound and take your boxers off, leaving your enthusiastic young cock bobbing in the air.  You pick up the black dress and slip it over your head.  As it slides down over your form you can&#39;t help but feel excited.  Girls were just so damn sexy, and now you felt like you could possess a part of that sexiness.  The idea of being beautiful and feminine was a thrill.  It made you feel powerful.  You eagerly reached back into the box for the panties, but before you grab them you begin to feel a tingle.  It felt...good!  So good.  Pleasure flowed into your being and you cry out in bliss as you fall back onto your back?  Was this the magic entering you?  Did it feel this good?  This...erotic?  Soon you&#39;re vigorously working your cock through the soft material of the dress.  It was so, so good.  So you didn&#39;t even notice as your body began to change, as your waist caved in and your hips flared out, as padding was added to your butt, as your face got cuter, your limbs slender and feminine.  What finally got your attention was when long, auburn hair fell in front of your face.<br />
<br />
You sat up in shock as you beheld your body.  It...it couldn&#39;t be...  You ran over to the full size mirror that was stored in the basement, an antique that had belonged to your great-grandmother.  The reflection showed what very much looked like a girl, and a stunningly pretty young girl with beautiful auburn hair and green eyes...but without breasts, and with a rather decidely not girlish bulge jutting out from the front of her dress.<br />
<br />
The dress!  It was magic!  It did this to you.  You had to get it off.  But when you pulled at it it didn&#39;t budge!  It snugly clung to your slender new body and refused to move.  More magic?  Then you felt yourself lift slightly into the air as if for a second you&#39;d weighed no more than a feather and a passing breeze had struck.  As you fell back down, you noticed something around your ankles, but it quickly shot up underneath your dress.  The panties!  no!  But it was too late as they quickly locked in around your hips and became as stubborn as the dress.  Then the pleasure came back.  No!  You didn&#39;t want to lose your dick!  But as the pleasure mounted, your feelings began to change.  It was just so good!  You couldn&#39;t help but start masturbating again, and soon the pleasure was so much that you fell back on your well padded ass.  Unconsciously your legs spread, like a girl would, and you might have seen your panties in the mirror as your skirt was pulled up, but you were too lost in the pleasure.  Finally you came, but it was different.  No cum shot forth from your cock, and the orgasm just didn&#39;t stop!  You just kept coming and coming, riding wave after wave of orgasmic pleasure as girlish squeals burst forth from your lips.  Finally your dick began to shrink, smaller and smaller until it was just a tiny little nub.  Your balls, which had begun to hurt as they pressed against your body with mounting pressure, yet also with pleasure, suddenly sucked inside.  You noticed with a moment&#39;s horror that you could no longer feel sensation in them, but you felt it in a new canal inside of you that they were digging as they travelled upwards to become your ovaries.  The feeling was mind shattering, and as another wave of pleasure took you you bucked and thrust your hips into the air, as if seeking penetration.  You didn&#39;t care anymore though.  You knew it might be magic affecting your mind, but it felt so good you didn&#39;t care.  You WANTED penetration.  The thought of a cock came to your mind, and you hardly hesitated to imagine it thrusting into you.  &quot;Yes, yes, YES!&quot; you heard yourself crying.  &quot;Fuuuuuuuck meeeeeee!&quot; you screamed, now fully imagining a muscular male body on top of you, pinning you down as he has his way with you.<br />
<br />
When finally the pleasure subsided at least to some level of mercy, you sat up and looked in the mirror.  You looked different, older.  Yes, the woman in the reflection now looked to be in her early twenties, and you...felt it.  You felt mature, confident.  It made no sense but you did.  Furthermore, as you looked into your eyes you didn&#39;t see a boy in a woman&#39;s body.  It was definitely a woman looking back at you.  You smiled a devilish smile as you spread your legs wider and examined your panty-clad but soaking wet nethers in the mirror, still occasionally trembling with post-orgasmic pleasure.  You could get used to this.  Then the bra appeared before you, floating in the air.  You offered no resistance, only smiling as it slipped under your clothes and fastened itself.<br />
<br />
As your chest began to tingle and your nipples quickly erected, you felt something different this time, a new energy. It was at once warm and cool and electric.  It was wild and untameable.  Was THIS magic?  Yes...yes that&#39;s exactly what it was, but not just any magic.  This was...chaos magic?  Then perky little mounds formed under your dress, and understanding began to flood your brain.  As your cup sized increased, so did your understanding, as if the size of your breasts directly correlated with your knowledge of magic, and judging from the cut of this dress, you were going to be very knowledgeable indeed.  Your were moaning again as the pleasure mounted once more, and massaging your tits, willing them to grow, and as they did you rode also the high of feeling your power and knowledge grow.  You realized you were becoming something far more powerful than a wizard or the female equivalent.  Wizards could only deal in the 4 elemental magics and of course some alchemy, but you were becoming a witch, a user of chaos magic.  It was a wild and unpredictable magic, but the strongest magic by far.  No Wizard could challenge you alone, and while wizards might craft their alchemic potions to prolong their life by a couple hundred years, you could live forever.  <br />
<br />
As the power of chaos flooded your mind, you knew it would change you, but you wanted it, wanted the power, but more than that you wanted to surrender control, wanted to be wild and free, and an avatar of femininity.<br />
<br />
So you gave in, and your breasts grew to stretch even the generously cut dress.  At last, you were finished.  You stood and beheld yourself with a smile.  Well, almost finished.  You held out your hand and the witch&#39;s hat flew to it.  You put it on your head with a flourish, and your auburn hair took on a brilliant orange color, perhaps even a glow.  You summoned the shoes in a similar fashion and stepped into them. You looked sexy as fuck.  You felt sexy, you felt confident, and bad ass, and your connection to the goddess of chaos let you access knowledge that backed up those feelings.  You could feel the other magic users in the universe.  There were various kinds, but you focused on the witches, and realized that you might very well be the most naturally gifted of them all.  Of course until you had more experience you couldn&#39;t use any big magic safely.  Not that it was likely to hurt YOU, but allowing chaos magic to flow freely could do any number of things to the rest of the world.  Learning to control chaos was an effort of centuries.  So you were sort of a magical nuclear warhead for now.<br />
<br />
and of course, there was the box.  It too was of chaos, and you realized it was even more powerful than you.  It must have been created by the goddess of chaos herself.  As you reached out to it with your feelings, you realized you were permanently bonded with it...and you felt its...personality?  Certainly, it was mischievous.  It had apparently transformed the wizard robes into the enchanted witch&#39;s outfit.  You could practically hear it giggling.  But you were mischievous now too, with chaos flowing through you. You could feel the wild energy.  It seemed to flow into your body through your pussy, filling it with pleasure, and then electrically flowing through the rest of you.  God, would you spend the rest of your life aroused? Yet as wonderful as that sounded, arousal was not the most pressing motivation in your mind.  Mischief was.  You wanted to go out there and in the world and stir up some trouble, have some fun, try out your magic maybe.<br />
<br />
You held out your hand again and a broom flew to it from the corner of the room.  Time to have some fun.</p>
