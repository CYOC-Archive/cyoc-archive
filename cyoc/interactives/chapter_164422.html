<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob’s point of view didn’t change, but in moments he was standing stably on the ground and although he was still substantially shorter than Kathy she no longer seemed immense to him, just very tall. Taking a step back so he could comfortably look Kat in the eye without craning his neck, his attention was suddenly drawn downward when his step resulted in a bizarre shifting and jiggling of weight. “Wha ….!”<br />
<br />
It happened so smoothly and quickly that Kathy couldn’t quite remember it. One moment she was hanging onto her tiny boyfriend’s disproportionately large erection as she helped balance him on stilts, the next moment a naked woman wearing ugly slippers is standing there mashing her big tits together with her forearms as she gropes her own crotch. Snickering to herself, Kathy knew there wasn’t a chance in hell of Rob being able to see past those tits for what he was groping to find. ‘Hmmm ... maybe saddling Rob with a forty-one inch E-cup was a bit much for someone only five-four, but Dolly Parton had that and she was even shorter.’<br />
<br />
Straightening up, Rob gave up looking for, or rather feeling for the object of his quest because all he could see was a huge expanse of breast. The boobs made it pretty clear what had happened, but he just couldn’t help checking, however irrational that seemed. “What –” Rob paused at the sound of his own voice. “What … what … happened&#8203;?”<br />
<br />
Kathy pursed her lips tightly to keep her smile from breaking into a full fledged cackling laugh at the sound of Rob’s high pitched Fuck-Kitten voice. She used Rob’s stunned silence to review the changes. Rob was now an extremely buxom but otherwise petite woman with long legs, at least proportionately, that will have him sitting a good inch or so shorter than would be typical of a woman of his height. His auburn pageboy hair framed his button nosed face cutely but would not draw attention away from his boobs for more than a glance. His nipples and areolas were proportionately large to match his breasts and they were impressively erect in the cool air conditioning of the room. She would have to wait to find out if the other details she’d wanted were present as they were more subtle.<br />
<br />
“Based upon your last change, it seemed like it wasn’t just your body part I was touching, it acted more like intent than specific contact. Since I had to keep you from ending up with a ridiculously huge cock, I figured I’d test my idea. It worked, you don’t have a huge cock, actually you don’t have a cock at all,” Kathy giggled. I want to go out and experience being tall and I figured you wouldn’t go out with me as a short man, although I would have been fine with it. This way we can go out and do things together and it will all be a perfectly normal outing for a couple of girlfriends, girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t go out like this!” Rob squeaked, hefting his huge breasts in his small hands. “There is no way in hell I can wear any of my clothes.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah clothes. I had originally bought some clothes with a different plan in mind but that’s all changed now. We’ll go shopping for clothes, but the immediate problem is mostly me, I don’t have anything to fit this five-ten body. You on the other hand have my entire wardrobe to chose from. Well, maybe only part of my wardrobe, I don’t have a bra that will fit those puppies you’re sporting,” She snickered.<br />
<br />
“I can’t be seen in public like this,” Rob pouted cutely, even though he intended it as a forceful objection.<br />
<br />
“Of course not, neither can I, we need clothes first, jeez girl don’t get your panties in a twist.” Kathy enjoyed watching Rob’s cute little face become flushed and flustered to the girl attribution. As it turned out, finding something for herself to wear was not as easy as she expected. Her panties stretched enough even if they were a bit tight. Her largest bra would be barely wearable for a little while, but the cleavage it imposed was quite eye catching. A pair of Rob’s cargo shorts belted in snugly would work until she could find something that was made for women.  One of Rob’s Hawaiian shirts covered most of the cargo short bunching, but she had to leave several buttons up top unfastened for her breasts which in turn displayed her mashed cleavage quite impressively. She didn’t have any shoes that fit her new five-ten size but fortunately the magic shoes solved that problem as pink sketchers with a bare minimum of sole.<br />
<br />
Ironically it was dressing Rob that turned out to be the bigger problem. Her panties fit him just fine, so too all of her shoes, but she didn’t have a bra that would even come close to mashing around his huge boobs. As fun as the thought of having him go bra-less was, she knew that getting him out and about absolutely required some basic support or he would complain and balk on her, ‘Men were such babies.’ Then she remembered! Pawing through her seldom or never worn dresses, she found it, her Bandage Fringe Dress! It had a builtin shelf-bra that should work.<br />
<br />
Despite Rob’s continuous albeit easily ignored ditsy sounding high voiced complaints, Kathy managed to wrestle him into the dress. The thin straps over both shoulders were working hard to hold everything together. Rob’s breasts were held forth in an amazing cornucopia offering of jaw dropping cleavage and knockers. The rest of the dress snugged his figure and ass in an A-line configuration that terminated at mid thigh. From the hem, long fringe dangled all around, hanging all the way down to the ground. <br />
<br />
“This is stupid! I can’t even walk without tripping on the fringe.”<br />
<br />
“Stop moving, you’ll tear the dress,” Kathy snapped as she bent down and helped Rob onto her highest slingback stilettos. “There,” she said, stepping back to examine the whole package. The stilettos brought the fringe up so it cleared the ground by about half the four inch heel. This not only allowed Rob to walk in the dress, it also required that he wear heals to be able to walk in the dress. “Let me see you walk.”<br />
<br />
Kathy was tickled to watch Rob walking comfortably and sexily about the room, turning, swirling, and pausing like a runway model, although runway models generally didn’t wobble, jiggle, and bounce with every movement like Rob did. She smiled to herself in contemplation of her as yet unverified other changes.<br />
<br />
“OK, we’re rather mismatched in our outfits but it will do for now. Let’s go,” she said grabbing her large bag and handing Rob her little clutch.<br />
<br />
Feeling railroaded, embarrassed, and excited, Rob looked at the little clutch purse in his hand confusedly and said, “I have to go to the bathroom.”<br />
<br />
“Well go, chop chop!” Kathy said shooing him off. ‘Hmmm, maybe ... just maybe,’ she thought as she watched Rob’s ass wiggle away.</p>
