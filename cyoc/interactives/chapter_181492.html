<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Donna slept peacefully on their beach towel, Tom got up and scooted over to her purse, digging inside it until his hands clasped around her wallet. He then got to his feet and walked down the beach, his barren pale chest feeling good under the sunlight instead of in the shade.<br />
<br />
He didn’t have to travel far to come across a wooden pier jutting out over the ocean with all sorts of shops on it. He stepped up on it and looked around curiously. He and Donna had picked up some food there earlier and he’d eyed up a few of the shops himself.<br />
<br />
First stop was a bookstore. He stepped inside the old building filled with used old copies of books. He’d been in bookstores before but only ever visited the same sections with Donna. This time he wandered down the shelves, pulling a couple genres Donna retched at down. A couple popular romance novels, a fantasy series that sounded cool but Donna hated because it dared to have a love triangle and a fun tone. He grabbed a book all about advice on getting pregnant, there was a book with a woman drawn on the cover with beautiful blonde hair and a smile on her face, and then a couple YA novels that sounded interesting.<br />
<br />
He left the shop laden with his purchases and entered a clothing store next door. He browsed the women’s section grabbing a bright blue bikini before exchanging it for the same colour with a bigger cup size. He then grabbed an outfit to wear over it, a loose top with floral flowers on it coloured pink and white and a pair of short shorts that looked exactly like what one of those women a beach towel over had been wearing. He added in some sunglasses and once he was done purchasing it he left.<br />
<br />
Donna was a picky eater, always playing it safe with what she ate and ordered, so Tom stood in line at a food truck and got an experimental smoothie with all sorts of fruit in it that tasted so sweet and a wrap with all these weird blended sauces and combinations that the vender said tasted good.<br />
<br />
He hit up an art supply store and stared at an entire row of tan paints, he picked up a thing of stickers with intricate and colourful butterfly and flower designs, and he slipped into a hair salon and grabbed a handful of blonde hair off the floor without the hairdresser even noticing him.<br />
<br />
Lastly was the beach’s music store. It sold all sorts of CDs, records, geeky shirts, and movies. He grabbed some music he’d thought sounded nice from the radio and the girls a beach blanket over. He grabbed a few movies while he was at it too, shows and movies he liked the descriptions and cover art for. He made his final purchase there before starting to leave only to slap his forehead. He turned back around and entered a shop that smelled like suntan lotion and soap. He bought a bunch of scented candles and a box of matches before running back along the beach and only halting when a sleeping Donna came into view. He then overturned his bag and got to work.<br />
<br />
He drew a circle in the sand, surrounded it with candles, and lit them one by one. As he stood up Donna stetched and yawned, turning towards him with a smile before seeming to notice what she was sitting in.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” She asked with a mad scramble to her feet. It was too late though, he chanted her spell in reverse and she exploded into a shower of inanimate objects, a human skull landing in the sand, a bunch of old records and metal CDs, and a plain sandwich because pickles were too much to handle.<br />
<br />
Tom cleaned up the mess, stuffing everything in Donna’s bag and setting her skull down in the middle of that circle. He squirted paint on her skull, set out a bikini, circled the skull in DVDs, placed that food and drink down, and so much more. By the time he was done and wiping his forehead off he had a bunch of objects in that circle where Donna had once stood. He then cleared his throat and started to chant.<br />
<br />
The sun got darker, the candles flared purple, and that skull began to float. Paper shredded, food melted, and that paint began to loose its texture and take on a fleshy look. Bones cracked into existence, organs formed, blood vessels and muscles wound up the skeletal legs, and a beautiful tan colour began to fill in the thing. A fleshlight leftover from Donna merged with the new girl’s body, and breasts formed on her chest, wrapped up in a beautiful blue bikini. Blonde hair erupted from her head, eyes formed and were covered by eyelids, and the last of the objects sucked into her body, leaving the new Donna to fall onto the sand wearing a pair of short shorts and a pink and white button down shirt tied off to the side so she beautiful naval showed atop a bright blue bikini. She had colourful tattoos on her skin depicting butterflies, flowers, and symbols and phrases from books and movies she liked. She was gorgeous.<br />
<br />
“What happened?” She asked while rubbing her blonde hair. It fell around her face in wavy clumps, framing her tanned skin and making her glow like a little ray of sunshine. Her voice was beautiful, and she had this almost song like tone to it, like she spent her time singing along to the radio.<br />
<br />
“You fell asleep Donna,” Tom explained and his girlfriend rubbed her eye before smiling, Donna had never smiled like that. Her teeth were beautiful and that smile alone made his heart flutter.<br />
<br />
“Well now I’m rested!” She exclaimed in an excited tone, jumping to her feet full of energy. “You’re getting the full beach experience Tom, let’s get in the water!”<br />
<br />
She threw her shirt off and pulled her shorts down before grabbing his hand and guiding him to the water. They splashed into it and she shrieked and laughed as they touched the cold water, dragging him into it until they were at their waists. She then dove in gracefully, fully submerging herself in the lapping waters. He shrugged before following suit. They both popped out of the water and she giggled moving close to him and guiding his foot.<br />
<br />
“Feel that squish, this is a big mossy rock. If we stay still a bunch of fish will come by,” she explained and sure enough after a few seconds colourful fish began to move towards their toes, oblivious to their presence.<br />
<br />
The water was fun with the new Donna, so fun in fact that he didn’t realize an hour had been spent out there until they got back to shore. Donna quickly dried off before dragging him back to the pier, except this time she was all bubbly and excited, watching a street performer in awe, checking out a food truck she’d never seen before, and grabbing fun looking novels off the shelves of the bookstore. She then vogued some new outfits for him, none of them the same blacks the old Donna always wore.<br />
<br />
Then she dragged him to the volleyball court where they played a game with the formerly obnoxious neighbours. After they lost she followed the girls back to their mat where they chattered and went from strangers to friends planning to meet up again in the span of an hour. Then Donna watched the family next to them with a look of longing, watching the kids run about and enjoy a day at the beach while their parents watched over them.<br />
<br />
“I want kids so bad,” she admitted with a snivel.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you going to finish your degree first?” Tom asked and his girlfriend sighed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah...” she admitted with a longing tone in her voice.<br />
<br />
“Would sex make you feel better?” Tom asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” she sighed before they returned to Donna’s car with the sunset and lay down together in the backseat. She settled herself down atop him, impaling her body with his member and grinning at him, only a condom between them.<br />
<br />
She began to grind on his body, her big breasts bouncing, her blonde hair swaying from side to side, and her tanned skin beading with sweat as they made love in the back seat of her car. Every sigh and moan made Tom smile more and more, and before long he came, inflating the condom with cum and loving the face his girlfriend made when that happened.<br />
<br />
The day at the beach was a success, and Tom now had a girlfriend who would actually show him things, a curious and attractive thing more to his liking. She seemed happier too, not quite as gloomy and miserable as the old Donna had been. He leaned over and kissed her on the cheek happy with what she’d become.<br />
<br />
She smiled from ear to ear and began to sing along with the radio, her voice making his heart flutter in joy, certain he wanted to grant her wish of having a child some day. He wanted nothing more than to see her absolute joy when a pregnancy test finally came back positive.</p>
