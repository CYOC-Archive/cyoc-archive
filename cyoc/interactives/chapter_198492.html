<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
It had been about a month since my transformation and I was happier than I had ever been as a boy. I had expanded my wardrobe for summer to include a really cute summer dress and a bikini for the pool. James and I had gone on a few more dates and progressed in our relationship so that I now openly referred to him as my boyfriend. <br />
One day I was at home with my sisters, we were talking about our boyfriends and the dates they had taken us on they were typical dates to the movies or dinner sometimes just going over to his house to hang out. James and I hadn&#39;t done anything more than cuddle since our first date but  so far that was more than either one of my sisters had done they had admitted to seeing and touching their boyfriends dicks but nothing more. My phone rang and it was James wondering if i wanted to go to the pool with him i told him i would get ready and he could come pick me up in a half hour<br />
I went into my room and got undressed still admiring my female body,I put on my bikini and a cover up quickly pulling my hair back and grabbed my sunglasses before heading out the door. We sat together in the backseat as his mom drove us to the pool and dropped us off. We got some chairs together and put on sunscreen i helped him with his back and he returned the favor for me. We relaxed in the sun for a while before we started to get to hot and decided to jump in i wet first and he jumped in after me, we swam around for a while before stopping against the poolside. I leaned against the pool wall while James stood in front of me, we talked about how our summer had been going and how we didnt want to go back to school<br />
After talking for a while, we decided to get out and dry off as we got out of the pool I turned to look at him. He was so cute in his swim trunks the wet material dripping water down his tanned legs my eyes moved up to his flat hairless stomach and chest to his smiling face. We dried off and sat back down to enjoy the sun some more. I grabbed my phone from my purse to see if I had any messages, I responded to my sister that I was having a good time at the pool and that I would be home in a few hours. I excused myself to go to the bathroom when I got back James had fallen asleep I pulled my chair closer to his and cuddled up with him kissing him on his neck. <br />
His mom came picked us up and drove to my house where James had been invited to dinner. We got home and my sister told me that mom had been called in to work so that it was just us for dinner and to go upstairs and get cleaned. James and I went upstairs to my room and closed the door I took off my cover up and tossed it in the hamper with a sly grin I also took off my bikini and looked over at James who was staring at me. “ What do you say we get cleaned up together? That way we can be ready faster” I walked over to him and pulled his swim trunks down his hard cock springing up after being released from the restricting clothing. “ Follow me”.I lead the way to the bathroom and closed the door before turning and kissing him pulling myself in tight pressing my breasts between us and feeling his soft cock against me. He pulled away looking into my eyes&quot; c-can I ask you something?&quot; I looked at him smiling &quot; sure you can ask me anything&quot; he pulled down his pants &quot; I really have to pee but I want you to hold it for me I&#39;ve always wanted to try it&quot; he looked embarrassed about asking me. I smiled and reached down wrapping my head around his penis&quot; now what do I do?&quot; I asked. &quot; Aim into the toilet and try not to miss&quot; he started peeing and I quickly aimed his penis into the toilet&quot; this is how boys pee it&#39;s so hot&quot; I started weaving his penis around as it started to get stiff in my hand, he finished peeing and kissed me sucking on my tongue, I returned the kiss gently playing with his penis. Our lips parted as we stood breathing heavily &quot;wanna see how a girl pees?&quot; I asked him, he nodded and sat down in front of the toilet as I sat down spreading my legs for him to see my slit, I reached down spreading my lips and releasing my piss into the toilet. He edged closer watching before suddenly sticking his hand into the stream cupping some of my pee and licking it off. He suddenly looked embarrassed&quot; I - I don&#39;t know why I did that&quot; I stood up &quot; how was it? &quot; He looked at his hand &quot; not bad actually&quot; I grabbed his penis and pulled him into the shower &quot; how about I try yours next time. We helped clean each other before getting out and drying off James got dressed in some clothes his mom and brought for him and i put on a pair of shorts and t-shirt <br />
We went downstairs to the kitchen and joined my sisters at the table for spaghetti. They greeted James and asked him about himself this being the first time they had really had a chance to talk to him. After dinner we went to the living room to watch tv, James excused himself to use the restroom. As so as le left the room my Julie handed me a small package “ open it before he gets back” I did as I was told and saw that I had been given some condoms” use them next time we don&#39;t need our little sis getting pregnant. I put the condoms in my back pocket smiling to myself and hoping I would be using them sooner than my sisters expected. James came back and sat down with me pulling me so that i was leaning against him. We watched a few tv shows together before I looked at my sisters and told them that James and I would be heading up to my room to hang out Julie caught my eye and I winked at her patting my back pocket before heading back up to my room. <br />
In my room I pushed James back onto my bed before straddling him leaning forward and kissing him before I know what was happening we were in full makeout session our arms wrapped around each other rolling on the bed. We stopped making out and laid on our backs breathing hard. I could see his erection pressing against his pants and rubbed it with my hand “ looks like someone is happy” while smiling at him. I pulled down his shorts and underwear and grabbed his cock in my hand slowly stroking the hard shaft playing with the head my fingers becoming sticky with precum. James reached over and pulled off my shirt revealing my breasts and caressing them gently before moving down to my shorts. <br />
We were both naked and playing with each other I was stroking his cock and he was fingering me while playing with my breasts. I let go of his cock and leaned down pulling the condoms out of my pocket and showing him, He stopped and looked at me” My sister gave them to me it would be a shame to let them go to waste. I unwrapped one and pulled down over his cock and stopping at the base just above his balls. I straddled him grinding my vagina down his stomach before lifting up and lining up with his cock.He reached down and helped guide his cock I lowered myself down feeling his cock enter my vagina and began stretching me out but I didn&#39;t stop until my butt rested on his thighs. It felt amazing almost better than the first time because we didn&#39;t have to worry about being caught my anyone. James started to thrust his hips slightly making me bounce and pushing his cock deeper, i started thrusting as well raising my butt and letting it drop back down on his thighs with a light smacking sound. We continued doing this for awhile I climaxed a few times during this making my whole body numb with pleasure. I was breathing hard and trying to get it under control when James grunted and thrusted his hips up higher and holding it before dropping back down gasping for breath. I leaned forward and kissed him on the lips.<br />
We stayed that way for a while his semi hard cock still inside me before his phone went off. His mom was texting him to let him know that she was on her way to pick him up. I got off of him letting his cock slip out and fall against his stomach with a wet slap. I pulled the condom it was still warm with his cum and tossed it in my trash and sat down next to him resting my head on his shoulder. James kissed me on the forehead and hugged me. We then got up and started getting dressed i grabbed his underwear before he could and tossed him mine” Something for you if you get lonely at home” he stuffed them in his bag and pull on his pants pushing his cock down, we got dressed and went back downstairs to the living room and rejoined my sisters on the couch. James looked at his phone and announced that his mom was here and he had to go i got up and walked him to the door kissing him again before he left.<br />
I walked back to my sisters and sat on the couch again.” Julie looked at me and asked” so what did you two do up there just talk about stuff?”. I nodded my head” we just talked and hung out”. She scoffed “ it looked like something on him was hanging out what happened to his underwear?”. I looked at her, “What do you want me to say? That we had sex again and it was great because if you really want to know what we did than thats it” Julie sighed “ Thats not what i meant, i dont care if you to have sex i just dont want him to hurt you, your my little sister im supposed to protect you”. I got up and walked over to her a hugged her” I know you are just trying to keep me safe and i love you for it but James would never hurt me, i actually think he&#39;s starting to love me. He just stares at me sometimes with this strange look on his face” Julie was quiet for a moment before asking me” Do you love him?”. I didn&#39;t know how to respond “I don&#39;t know if this is my first real relationship with someone you know i didn’t really have any friends before the change so i don’s know”. Julie looked at me “ don’t worry we’ll help you figure it out” She sniffed me “ now go take a shower you smell like sex”.<br />
I went back upstairs and headed to my bedroom laying down on my bed rubbing myself thinking about James and our relationship together. My panties were soon soaking wet and I pulled them down and pushed my fingers into my wet pussy, biting my lip to keep from moaning I teased myself pretending it was James. There was a knock on my door and Julie suddenly poked her head in &quot; are you going to take&quot; her voice trailed off as she saw me laying on my bed legs spread out fingers buried in my pussy. &quot; So no shower yet?&quot; I covered myself embarrassed about being caught&quot; I got distracted&quot; I Julie smiled and sat down on the bed&quot; I can&#39;t blame you he is really cute&quot; she stood up and walked to the door &quot; try using the shower head helps with the mess&quot;</p>
