<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madam smiled and spoke condescendingly “someone’s a bit grumpy! Whose a big girl? You are!” She cooed and Deborah tried to step closer to the woman but couldn’t get very far due to her friend humping her leg.<br />
Madam Illusia thought about the woman’s offense at being called a little girl and looked towards Monica’s boyfriend and an idea for what she was going to do to Deborah.  Before addressing Deborah, though, Maddame Illusia needed to put Monica in a crate since she somehow escaped the kennel.  And so she magicked up a large dog crate, grabbed up Monica&#39;s leash, and forcibly drug Monica away from Deborah and forced Monica into her crate before slamming the door shut and securing it so Monica couldn&#39;t get out.  Monica had wimpered, she didn&#39;t know what she did wrong, but clearly her owner was upset at her.  Dejectedly, Monica curled up and lied down.  In truth though, Madame Illusia was pleased at Monica for her behavior, but didn&#39;t show it to anyone.  Madame Illusia then turned her attention back toward Deborah who was still trying to make her way towards the witch.  &quot;Awe, look at my baby all grown up trying to act like a big girl by trying to walk on her own.  But, I don&#39;t think my big girl is able to walk too far without falling.  No, she can&#39;t. No, she can&#39;t.  Mommy&#39;s big girl needs mommy to support her doesn&#39;t she?  Yes, she does!  Yes, she does!&quot;, Madame said in condescending baby talk toward Deborah.  Deborah was able to make it a couple of steps further before falling to her hands and knees.  As the crowd jeered on, Deborah&#39;s eyes took on a terrified look.  Madame slowly walked up to Deborah, grabbed her by her waist and pulled Deborah up as Deborah, with as much strength in her legs as possible, tried to stand up again.  While assisted by Madame Illusia  Deborah walked over to near where Damon was and was once again lowered back on to her seat again by Madame.  &quot;See!  Mommy&#39;s big girl can still walk with the help of mommy, oh yes she can!  Deborah tried to crawl toward Damon looking for security but was stopped when her face hit a very strong mesh fabric.  A thin white foam padded vinyl mat spread out from underneath her. She looked all around her and discovered that the mesh wall surrounded her on all sides and was really tall.  she pulled herself up to a standing position with the help of the metal bar that was keeping the mesh from falling to the ground and discovered that the bar went up to her shoulders.  She&#39;d never be able to escape!  she released her grip on the metal bar and allowed herself to fall back down onto her butt, but this time, due to the padded mat underneath her, it didn&#39;t hurt when she fell.  Deborah knew she was doomed and under her breath said, &quot;Fuck!&quot;  Madame Illusia, hearing Deborah speak said,&quot;My, my.  Is my big girl trying to talk to me?  Is she trying to say mama?  Say mama, baby, say mama!&quot;.  Deborah decided that instead of fighting, that it would be better to cooperate.  And so, Deborah said mama, but it came out slured.  She tried to say other words, but no matter how hard she tried she just couldn&#39;t get her mouth to move right to say them.  &quot;Did my big girl say her first word?  She did, didn&#39;t she.  Yes, she did!&quot; Madame said in a sing song voice.  Damon looked at Deborah in the playpen and was happy to have a friend, all be it a much younger one.  &quot;Is she my friend?&quot;, Damon asked.  &quot;No, Damon, she&#39;s your sweet one-year-old baby sister.&quot;, replied Madame.  &quot;Oh.&quot;, Damon returned.  He was glad to have a baby sister, but was happy he didn&#39;t have to wear diapers, dresses, and tights.  No, he didn&#39;t want that.  He was happy in his big boy training pants and his colored socks and his shortalls.  With his sister in the background, he turned his attention back to playing.  &quot;Deborah, you look adorable in your dress.  I love the fact that your diaper peaks out below it a little bit.  I bet you love the mouse printed on your diaper.  He&#39;s holding a red balloon while flying through the sky, isn&#39;t that cute?  And your shoes, black patent Mary Janes with white ruffled socks.  It&#39;s just so precious isn&#39;t it?&quot;, Madame spoke.  Deborah looked down and indeed, her regular clothes disappeared.  Her sleek little black dress was no more.  In its place she wore a red velvet dress with puffed up sleeves and a black skirt that came down to just below her hips.  It did little to hide the fact that she no longer was wearing a black thong.  In the thong&#39;s place was a pristine white thick disposable diaper with a mouse holding a balloon printed on it.  On her feet, her high heels had become the before mentioned Mary Janes and indeed she was wearing white ruffled socks.  As she was looking at her shoes, she noticed the white of her playpen floor started to decorate itself with pink and baby blue teddy bears in diapers, hearts, bibs, pacifiers, and bottles.  On the floor of the playpen, a baby&#39;s xylophone appeared right along with a pink teddy bear a wooden farmer and four wooden barnyard animals, a cow, a chicken, a pig, and a sheep.  Madame walked up to Deborah&#39;s playpen, bent over it peaking in on Deborah and said,&quot;Mommy&#39;s big girl is going to have a big surprise tomorrow, yes she is!  She&#39;s been enrolled into the one-year-old class at daycare where she&#39;s going to have fun all day long.  Doesn&#39;t that sound wonderful?  While there, you&#39;ll be given food on the tray of your high chair so that you can use your thumb and pointer finger to grasp your cut-up nummies and put them in your tummy one at a time.  I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll enjoy stacking cups or putting and pulling things out of a container.  Who knows, maybe your daycare worker will hide toys under a blanket for you to discover.  And when you get tired, your daycare worker will let you sleep in a crib for up to three hours.  That sounds like fun, doesn&#39;t it?  Don&#39;t worry if you make messies and wetties in your diaper, a day care worker will routinely check your diaper to make sure you&#39;re clean and dry.  If you&#39;re not, she will be more than happy to change you.  And when you&#39;re done, you can come home to mama and be fed more nummies in your high chair.  Then you&#39;ll be changed into your comfy night time diaper which is much thicker than the one you&#39;re wearing now.  I&#39;ll put you in your comfy blanket sleeper and put you in your crib for the night at around five in the evening and wake you up at six in the morning for daycare again.&quot;  With that, Madame Illusia pushed the tip of her pointer finger against Deborah&#39;s forehead.  Deborah, being paralyzed due to feeling fuzzy in her brain, realized that this was the end of  the road.  At the age of 23, she busted her ass to start a successful business, but now, that&#39;s no more.  Now, she realizes that she&#39;s going to be a one-year- old in mind, but 23 years old in body, much like Damon.  She felt everything slipping from her mind.  Her first date, her first car, all of that was slipping away.  She felt as her knowledge of algebra and biology disappeared.  Then she felt addition and subtraction disappear.  Afterwards, she lost the names of the days of the week and months of the year.  She forgot how to tell time by looking at a clock.  She forgot the concept of money and why it&#39;s important. and finally she forgot most of the words in the English language.  Aside from no and mama, she could only understand 24 other words when it was spoken by adults.  Of course, she could only say one word, mama.  Deborah, in her new mental state, looked over towards all of the toys and crawled towards the teddy bear to munch on her ear for comfort.  Meanwhile, the rest of Damon and Monica&#39;s friends, all five of them walked up on stage.  In the party were two men and three women.  &quot;Madame!&quot;, one of the women spoke,&quot; My name is Chelsea, no one in my group likes what you&#39;re doing here, but can you please help us?  We can&#39;t live knowing that you&#39;ve turned our three friends into a dog and children in their mind.  Since we can&#39;t fight you and we can&#39;t bear to live with out them.  Can you make us like them as well so that we can stay together?  Personally, I can&#39;t carry this burden any longer, can you please give me the mind of a newborn so that I can join my friend Deborah in nursery school as well as in her nursery in my own crib?&quot;  Madame then asked all the other people what they would like and got to know them better.  Tina loves taking care of children and so she wants to become a 15 year old in mind, but keep her current physical age.  Jack is interested in attending an all girl&#39;s school, but wants to start off as a kindergartner.  He has chosen to remain a male adult, but have the mind of a five-year-old girl.  Paul has chosen to keep his physical age, but have the mind of a 12 year old in middle school.  Becky, however is the most interesting of the crew.  She wants to remain her physical age, but wants to attend a school for special education.  In her mind, she wants to be 17, but have the intellect of a third grader.  This was right up Madame&#39;s plan.  She had always wanted a big family, but was never able to have children of her own.  Now she can have seven children in adult bodies and a dog in a human body.  She knew having a special needs child and a transgender child would be difficult, but she was up for the challenge.</p>
