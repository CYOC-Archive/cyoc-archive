<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer followed Amy across the lunch room towards the table where her new friends sat. She wanted a look at who they were, but Jen found her eyes continually sliding towards Amy as she followed along, especially towards her rear.<br />
<br />
Despite being a nerd, Jen thought. She&#39;s got a nice body. <br />
<br />
She considered whether Amy had always been this attractive or if the love from the curse made her see Amy as such now. She quickly decided she didn&#39;t much care and went back to roving her eyes over her girlfriend&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Amy was slightly taller than her now at 5&#39;3&quot;, with a thin frame. The exceptions to this were her surprisingly pert ass and her respectable pair of B-cups. <br />
<br />
She was dressed in a high-waisted black flared skirt that went slightly below mid-thigh, with a powder pink knitted sweater up top. Peeking out of its rounded collar was the white peter pan collar of the blouse Amy was wearing underneath. <br />
<br />
Her supple legs were encased in a pair of sheer black tights, which led down to a pair of ankle-high black boots that were cinched tight with two buckled straps, and one inch block heel that increased her height above Jen&#39;s. Sticking out just above the tops of Amy&#39;s boots were a pair of black cotton socks.<br />
<br />
Amy threw a glance back towards Jen, then did a double-take as she saw how intensely Jennifer was staring at her body. She stopped walking and turned to face Jennifer fully, and Jen&#39;s blue eyes flew up to meet Amy&#39;s orange-brown ones. <br />
<br />
Her very pale skin was dotted with cute freckles across her nose and her black, slightly wavy hair was pulled into a ponytail that hung past her shoulders. A pair of black glasses sat comfortably on her nose.<br />
<br />
Amy smirked at her, the corner of her soft pink lips rising slightly as her eyes twinkled with mischief from behind her glasses. Jen bit her own lip at this as a warmth erupted in her nether regions. It was all she could do not to grab Amy and kiss her right there.<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s smile deepened, as if she could sense Jen&#39;s desire. <br />
<br />
She leaned in towards Jennifer&#39;s ear and whispered, &quot;Like the outfit, or what&#39;s under it? Don&#39;t worry, you can get a better look at both once we&#39;re at your place.&quot;<br />
<br />
This caused Jennifer to shudder slightly in delight, a few dewy drops of arousal dampening her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kinda surprised though,&quot; Amy continued. &quot;To see you in jeans and sneakers, normally you&#39;re twice the girly girl that I am.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy then pulled back, winking at Jennifer as she turned and continued heading towards the table with their waiting friends.<br />
<br />
At these words, Jennifer felt another head rush, like when she had opened the door to find Amy, as new thoughts entered her mind. Clearly the curse wasn&#39;t done with them yet. <br />
<br />
Her ideas of cute outfits and proper behaviors were switching. Out went jeans and most athletic clothing, and in came skirts, stockings, blouses, and all manner of frills. It caused a slight stutter to her step as she moved to follow Amy, but she kept herself steady, recovering and walking with a daintier stride behind the dark-haired girl as fresh changes engulfed her own outfit.<br />
<br />
Her white blouse gained more frills, the sleeves unrolling themselves before shortening up to the middle of her biceps. They puffed outwards a bit and the hems gained slight ruffles. The collar pulled itself closed a bit higher on her neck, and a long white bow tie billowed out from beneath it, the ends of it falling to the middle of her chest.<br />
<br />
Her jeans changed texture, the denim shifting into a paisley patterned cotton, still retaining their navy color. Their legs began to recede upwards, stopping at mid-thigh before their inner seams abruptly split open. The opposing threads jump out at each other, intertwining and forming her new flared skirt. It flowed smoothly around her legs as she walked, and she shuddered involuntarily as the breeze it made passed over her dampened underwear.<br />
<br />
The waist of the skirt didn&#39;t stay still for long either as it moved upwards, reaching above the hem of her new blouse. It crawled along her waist and up her chest, beneath the hanging ribbons of her bow tie, stopping just below her collarbone as two strands of fabric each on her front and back shot up and over her shoulders, connecting to finish the straps of her navy dress.<br />
<br />
Down at her feet, Jennifer could feel her black converse shifting, causing her feet to tingle pleasantly. The blackness of her shoes&#39; canvas quickly invaded the white rubber and laces, turning them dark as the material of the shoes shifted from canvas to leather. The majority of the shoes began evaporating away, exposing the tops of her feet and the low-cut white socks she had worn beneath her sneakers as the shoes became a pair of black flats. The remains of each shoe&#39;s tongue thinned and widened, forming a single thin black strap that crossed over the top of her foot near her ankle before securing themselves with a small silver buckle.<br />
<br />
Her white socks began creeping onto the tops of her feet, sliding smoothly beneath the straps of her new Mary Janes and greedily devouring her legs as they rose steadily up and up. The pleasant tingling sensations rose from her toes to her ankles and beyond as the material of the socks thinned and smoothed out, becoming soft and silky while still retaining an opaque white color.<br />
<br />
They climbed completely up Jennifer&#39;s thighs before extending across her crotch and rear, fully becoming a pair of tights. The pleasant snug sensations around her feet, legs, and ass were slightly distracting, but Jen was glad to have a new barrier between her damp panties and the breeze from her dress.<br />
<br />
As a final touch, her two hair clips merged together into one piece, darkening as it morphed itself across the top of her head before settling into the shape of a wide navy hairband.<br />
<br />
Her changes finished just as the two girls arrived at their table. Amy quickly sat down but Jennifer paused, standing with her legs straight and held tightly together, absentmindedly twisting one heel back and forth. She held her arms down and across the front of her blouse and dress, her hands clasped together girlishly as Jennifer surveyed the two other girls at the table. <br />
<br />
She had a vague recollection of Katie and Lisa from her old life, but only as two fellow seniors in some of her classes who had been too nerdy for her to pay much attention too. <br />
<br />
Fresh details about their time spent together in school as children and teens began pouring into her mind, rewriting her memories. She began thinking of them not as random classmates, but as the best friends she had.<br />
<br />
Amy turned back around to look at Jennifer, again flashing that smile that never failed to make Jen go weak at the knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming?&quot; She said, patting the spot next to her on the table&#39;s bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; said Jennifer brightly, and she sat down with the new friends she&#39;d known her whole life.</p>
