<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(authors note: I will mainly do post-workout transformations as I do not know how to properly describe a workout. also, this may be the longest chapter I&#39;ve ever done.)<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
alistair: <br />
<br />
he was not disappointed by the changes. Several men and some women had left the gym. some of the changes were small but others were much more apparent. he waved at the man he saw from the cafe. he was now a 6-foot lion centaur. <br />
<br />
he then saw who he had been waiting for. Olivia was the first to come. she was now 5&#39;10&quot; and had gained some muscle. &quot;enjoy your workout?&quot; he asked her. &quot;yeah, I was expecting to be sore and exhausted but I feel so alive now,&quot; Olivia said. <br />
<br />
They shook hands as one of her friends came from another area. Megan had gained some muscle too. &quot;hey how was the reptile area.&quot; Alistair asked. &quot;it wuz amazin&#39; sir. thet self-workout routine wuz awesome.&quot; she said. her voice sounded deeper to Olivia and Alistair had noticed a slight bulge on the girl&#39;s neck. before they could comment Ashley had come from the fish area. she could almost be mistaken for a guy. <br />
<br />
She had gotten an extra foot in height bringing her to 6&#39;4&quot;. her now small breasts were dwarfed by the large pectoral muscles behind them. her hourglass figure had been filled out into a slight box shape due to her new muscle. her new shredded body came with new clothes. a shirt with the revisions (fish-styled) logo on it further obscured her remaining breast tissue. <br />
<br />
a black pair of swim shorts showed off a small bulge. some of her animal changes had even set in. Around her gills, her skin had turned blue. on her white front a bulge was seen giving her a deep masculine voice. &quot;hey guys like my new clothes&quot; Ashley or rather Ash said. &#39;looks like his mental state has changed drastically&#39; Alistair thought. <br />
<br />
he noticed that while the other girls were shocked they were amazed too. mary had walked up as Ash was flexing. that juice had altered her significantly. She or rather he had lost all feminine markers as well as muscle gain. the 6-foot woman now had a muscular v shape complete with a strong set of pectorals. <br />
<br />
her urethra and clitoris merged into a small dick. (the juice was most effective along the digestive tract.) a bulge on her neck gave her a deep voice as well. As for her face well it was somewhere between feminine and masculine. &quot;looks good dude. no doubt you&#39;re going to be a pro at swimming&quot; Mary said. the final member of the group had arrived. <br />
<br />
piper hadn&#39;t changed much in the ways of masculinity however her species had changed somewhat. her front, inner arms, and inner legs were now creme in color while the rest was green. mucus caused her clothes to stick to her. the only masculine thing was a foot-long bulge going from her crotch and up her shirt. &quot;well that was a workout&quot; Piper croaked. her throat moved when she did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;well now that you&#39;re all here I wanted to speak to you. I&#39;ve heard from Mike that you five have each gone to an area. As such I&#39;d like to offer you five lifetime passes&quot; he said. the five girls (future males) were shocked but accepted. &quot;well we have to go&quot; Olivia said as the five grabbed the passes. after he left he made a phone call. <br />
<br />
&quot;hey Florence I got five girls at once how about you&quot; he nodded as she spoke. &quot;that&#39;s impressive. can&#39;t wait for the workouts to be complete&quot; he smiled as he changed in the full moon&#39;s light.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
the next day:<br />
<br />
Olivia:<br />
<br />
this was a dream come true. she had scored her and her friend&#39;s lifetime passes to revision gym. they all had jobs so they agreed to go every Sunday as a group. she had ordered some Japanese takeout to celebrate and watch a movie. waking up today she felt even more energy flowing through her body.  <br />
<br />
going through her closet proved hard as her new muscle and height made her clothing taunt. thankfully revision had opened up clothing shops around town. she would go after her job. Bestiacrest High School was a good public school. she was the current gym teacher there.   <br />
<br />
she sees herself as an example for her students. arriving at the school she was approached by her assistant coach Samuel. &quot;Hey, Sam you ready for the day,&quot; Olivia asked. &quot;yeah I thought we were gonna meet at the gym yesterday&quot; Sam was African American and before today very hairy. now his hair seemed gone while his chest showed two small bumps.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess we went to two separate revision gyms. I took the male one as it was closer to my apartment. guessing you went to the girl&#39;s one&quot; The two talked until class started. Olivia would change over the day. not as noticeable as at the gym but she did change. She gained an inch of height. after the first period, black feathers appeared along her spine as her feminine features shifted slightly.  <br />
<br />
her already tight clothes became almost painfully taunted by the end of the day. &quot;well that was a day. felt good after the gym huh?&quot; Sam said. his chest now showed obvious a-cup breasts and his crotch was looser. &quot;yeah I think my clothes shrunk or something I&#39;m gonna head to the store.&quot; Olivia said as the taunt clothes she was wearing became tighter. she had just gotten to her car when a pants button popped off.  <br />
<br />
it ricocheted off her car and hit her now smaller breasts. looking down she saw something strange. her panties were being pushed away from her. She then felt her bra begin to dig into her. driving to the store she felt her shirt begin to rip at the seams.  <br />
<br />
once inside she was greeted by an anthro cow. &quot;hi my name is Denise and what can I...&quot; the lady soon saw the problem as Olivia&#39;s shirt was ripping with every movement. her pants weren&#39;t fairing much better. &quot;let me guess revision gym&quot; she then gestured to Olivia to the back just as her shirt ripped off. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to me!&quot; Olivia said as she suddenly noticed the black feathers spreading slowly across her back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t panic this is normal. *sigh* looks like I&#39;m gonna have to explain&quot; Denise said. she then explained revision and how it improves humanity. She also had to explain how they used a compound called acceptance to keep people from freaking out. &quot;so since acceptance is in your genes now your scent will prevent people from freaking out when talking to you&quot; Denise finished as Olivia put on her new outfit. she was thankful that the compound filled the store otherwise she&#39;d probably be yelled at. &quot;so it won&#39;t stop until I&#39;m done&quot; Olivia said.  <br />
<br />
she now had a new outfit that fit her. &quot;yes but think of the perks.&quot; Denise then said it was on the house. Olivia left leaving Denise to call her boss. &quot;yeah it&#39;s Denise. The compound at the gym needs to be adjusted. A member came in and was upset when they saw feathers on their back&quot;. Olivia immediately went home and texted her friends to come over. they needed to discuss things. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
later: <br />
<br />
after texting some they all agreed to meet at the library. Megan was the head librarian so she would let them in after hours. Olivia was the first to public library. all she got from the texts was the others had discovered their changes today as well. &quot;Megan you here?&quot; Olivia said.  <br />
<br />
glancing down proved irrationally arousing as her clitoris now poked two inches out of her vagina.  &quot;yeah Ahm hare in thuh main room.&quot;  a masculine voice said. entering the main room showed Megan at a rounded desk. she had a book in front of her obscuring her face. putting it down showed she had indeed changed. Megan&#39;s neck had thickened considerably and scales had grown.   <br />
<br />
tan covered a large bulge on her neck and green rigid scales covered the rest. it was also worth noting that she had a row of dark green spiked ridges running down her neck and head. her hair was now gone. &quot;Ah didn&#39;t notice until mah hair started fallin&#39; out. how bout yawl?&quot; she asked in an annoyed tone. Megan got up to pull out Olivia&#39;s chair as a noticeable bulge was on her crotch. She had yet to change her outfit so it was more noticeable.  <br />
<br />
&quot;well this has become a sausage party,&quot; Ash said as he came in. he had found himself referring to the masculine pronouns since a little before the texts. he had joined the same boat as Megan. his neck was now incredibly thick as blue covered his neck and shoulders. a large fin removed his hair. his breasts had vanished and the bulge in his shorts had grown to average size.  <br />
<br />
the 6&#39;6&quot; future shark man sat in a seat. &quot;found myself acting like a guy and knew something was wrong&quot; Ash said. &quot;looks like I&#39;m not the only guy here&quot; a guy said as he approached them. If it wasn&#39;t for the buck teeth and rabbit ears they wouldn&#39;t know this was Mary. &quot;I can live with the muscle but the rabbit features are too much,&quot; she said.  <br />
<br />
Blond fur now covered his masculine face while creme fur ran down his front. There was also a decent-sized bulge on her crotch.&quot; well where&#39;s Piper?&quot; Olivia asked. &quot;here,&quot; Piper said as she entered the room. she now had a large bulge on her crotch.  <br />
<br />
her skin was now creme on the front and green everywhere else. she had joined Ash and Megan in the hair loss department. only she had no hair anywhere. instead, a thin layer of mucus covered her. her pelvis and thighs now looked incredibly muscular.  <br />
<br />
&quot;when I felt a different slime from my crotch I knew something was different&quot;. Olivia, and they explained how their day went. Megan noted how she was doing inventory when she saw her hair falling to the floor. &quot;Ah tried tuh wear uh hat until these spikes ripped thoo them&quot; she sighed. green scales began to spread down from her former hairline.  <br />
<br />
ash explained that when he started introducing himself as Ash he knew something was wrong. he worked at the marine catch restaurant near the boardwalk. &quot;when people called me sir and I couldn&#39;t correct them I knew something was wrong&quot; Ash said. his face is now blue and his jawline is white. Mary or Max as he suddenly found himself calling himself had figured out at the veterinary clinic.  <br />
<br />
&quot;When I started eating the rabbit&#39;s food I knew something was wrong&quot; After he said this a slight ripping sound was heard. max stood up suddenly and everyone saw his shoes literally exploding off of him. his feet were now large rabbit feet with some human characteristics. after he sat back down Piper explained herself. &quot;well I was tutoring a young girl. She was what you can call a hot one. That&#39;s when I felt two pushing sensations and then a new slimy sensation.&quot; she explained.   <br />
<br />
her legs had bulked up considerably, especially those needed for jumping.  her brow ridges became more prominent as well. after talking they found themselves unable to complain about it. unbeknownst to them. the compound mixed into their musk now made them accept the more they changed. By the end of their meeting, they all decided to keep going to the gym and embrace the masculinity they had gained.</p>
