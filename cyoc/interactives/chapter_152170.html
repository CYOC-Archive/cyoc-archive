<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy hadn´t known before how much he liked being in control over others so much.<br />
He had now already control over the ex-swimmers as his clothes, the thief Frank as his new dog and his ex-younger brother and the others inside the glass prison, but he want to have more. The only problem he got would be that until now he had only sorted out people with bad behavior or actions and looking for more people like this wouldn´t be easy. <br />
That´s the reason why he decided that he would change other people to his liking without that requirement. The first thing he wanted to solve was his family. Without his younger brother he was an only child to a single mother, his father had left them after George had been born, so now he had left without that reason, but he had fought with his mother before that. He disliked his father for leaving them and never calling him, so if he could find him he would give him the punishment he wished for his father. He noticed that his father would even fit with his requirement from before.<br />
Then he would need a replacement, someone who could be a good father for him and a loving man to his mother. And if he could control them maybe some new siblings were also possible. But that he would solve after he found his father, maybe he would find someone on the way.<br />
Searching for his father on the internet took only a couple of minutes and to his luck he hadn´t moved that far away, where he married again. Tommy decided he would need to see this woman and than see what to do with her. Seeing at it was already early afternoon he planned to visit his father tomorrow after school. <br />
<br />
The school day had been pretty boring to Tommy. For one, he was already a bit ahead of his class, so he learned nothing new. And second, he wanted the day to end so he could finally punish his father. <br />
It was lunch break when he stumbled into a situation that needed his attention, at least in his mind. There was Rick, a  twelve year old boy with glasses who had recently lost his parents and now lived with his uncle. Said uncle ignored the boy most of the time, so Rick had slowly excluded himself from everything to sink in his sorrow, making him an easy target for bullies. And two of them, Lucas and Chad, were already bullying the poor boy.<br />
Thinking fast, Tommy froze the three of them completely, giving himself a bit of time to decide what to do with them. He had sympathy with Rick, so he didn´t want to change him in a punishing way. After a couple of minutes he decided to make Rick his new younger brother. That meant he would only change minor things on his body, like taking away his freckles, correcting his eyes and making him a bit bigger, but change his memories to being his younger brother since birth. He would forget his old parents and with that his sorrow, which should make him a bit happier again. He would also make him a bit more obedient to himself so he wouldn´t annoy him like George had before.<br />
<br />
What he would do with Chad was already decided, but with Rick becoming his younger brother he could just change Lucas the same way. So the two of them would become bikes for him and his brother. <br />
So he typed the changes into his laptop. Rick didn´t need to change much on the outside, only growing a couple of inches, including his clothes and correcting his eyes so the glasses could vanish. The changes of his mind were only visible in Ricks face, with turned more happy and relaxed despite being still frozen.<br />
The other two changed more. Lucas was the first to change and let out a scream of pain, Tommy had given them both their voices back, just to enjoy their pleas and pain. Lucas legs forced themselves as far from each other as possible before splitting in the middle. While his feet turned into the wheels, his legs become the green holding bars. His back bend down until it was parallel with the ground while his ass stretched a bit above, turning more triangular into the seat. The upper body thinned out, turning into another green bar of the bike. His arms bend down, his elbows reaching the front wheel bar before merging with them, turning into yet another bar. His hands pointing outwards turned into the pedals.<br />
From his changing insides emerged his heart, turning into the dynamo with his veins turned into the cables for the headlight, slowly creeping up his body. His bowels emerged and turned into the bike chain while his cock grew erect before becoming a metal kickstand. His balls separated and fell off before the skin becomes harder. The inside grew into soft filling material for the new helmet for the driver.<br />
All the time screaming in pain, Lucas suddenly stopped, but not on his own act, but because his mouth just closed and fused with his nose before being sucked into his face, reemerging on top of his head as the bikes bell. His eyes then merged into one before turning into the headlight of the bike, the cable plugging itself in. The ears and his hair were the last things to change, expanding outwards into the handles and the bikes brakes.<br />
<br />
Chad had started pleading to Tommy while Lucas changed, but that fell on deaf ears. Instead Chad suddenly dropped down on his hands and knees. Other than with Lucas Chads feet turned inwards, sole to sole, before merging together and growing rounder. The same happened to his hands, arms stretched wide forward. His hands and feet had become the wheels for the second bike. His arms and legs thinned into blue metal bars for holding said wheels in place. Just like Lucas before him Chad ass stretched upwards and formed into a triangular bike-seat. His tailbone poked out underneath the front of the newly formed seat, expanding until it hit his neck, merging with it while his body thinned out, forming the other blue bars of the bikes frame. While like Lucas Chads heart turned into the dynamo, his bowels changed into the chain and his cock became the kickstand, it was his balls that grew outwards into the second bikes pedals. Chad now looked like a bike with a human head. But that changed when his face turned by 180°, his eyes on the bottom and his mouth on top of it. While his ears expanded into the handles with his hair as the brakes, his eyes merged into the headlight and his mouth and nose merged into the bike bell like it had with Lucas.<br />
With both boys changed into bikes their discarded and ripped clothes started to vanish into thin air, the only exception were their belts, with in turn changed into bike locks each.<br />
<br />
Tommy looked happy at the two bikes and his new brother before he noticed that the changes had a bad timing. With a younger brother he would need to drive home with him after school instead of visiting his father. But Rick shouldn´t miss his lessons. With a sigh Tommy looked down at his laptop before starting to type in the easiest solution for now. The bikes shrunk down to toy-size so he wouldn´t need to bring them outside. Then he let Rick regain control over his body. Rick blinked at him. “Hi, big brother. Where you looking for me?” Tommy answered: “Yes, Rick. We need to meet here after school again.” “Okay.” was all answer he got before Rick headed off to his next class, as did Tommy himself as well.<br />
After school they meet up again in that corridor and Tommy worked fast. He froze Rick again and let the bike that was former Lucas regrow. Ricks frozen body started to move on his own, put his new helmet on before mounting his new bike. Then both he and the bike started to shrink down again into the size of an action figure, turning plastic. <br />
&quot;That way I can take you with me and change you back to your new normal when we are home again.&quot; He grabbed the figure and put it into his bag before heading outside, regrowing his own bike and mounted it.</p>
