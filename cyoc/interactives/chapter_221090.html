<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to take the less confusing of the options clicking to let the newly transformed shewolf choose her own destiny.<br />
<br />
And with how her erotic primal dream and unyielding heat seems to be effecting her thoughts, you can most likely assume what destiny she wishes to fulfill.<br />
<br />
The shewolf snarls at the glass barrier keeping the beast trapped in this manufactured den, pounding and causing cracks to form.  However; before she unleashes her fury completely, the shewolf&#39;s ears perk and erect; a look of realization crossing her eyes, as if she has just remembered something important.  That being the latch on the door&#39;s handle keeping the sliding glass locked.  With a soft whine her claws fiddle with the small lever until it unlocks.  Padded forepaws press into the glass and starts pushing away from the edge, a light metallic screech sounding as she fully slides the glass open.<br />
<br />
Her feral face beams, golden hues glowing bright as her maw unhinges and her panting tongue lolls.  The cool night breeze whisks past her furry body as she steps out onto the backyard deck, toe claws tapping upon the wood as she draws closer to the grassy field and flower bushes.  The sweet aromatic scent of her yard and the woodlands beyond captivate, wild energy coursing within as her tail wags furiously in her excitement.  She slouches forward, forepaws limp and out front ready to catch the ground as she inevitably falls and lands on all fours like a proper wolf.<br />
<br />
She&#39;s happy.  It&#39;s difficult to tell how much of the woman before her metamorphosis is left, or if there is nothing but just a wolf taken over.  There wasn&#39;t much to go off from her original personality anyways, your choices leading you both here stripping any potential interactions she might of had before going fully animal.  Regardless; the shewolf lifts her head and howls triumphantly singing her wild freedom to the world, to any wolves roaming the woods that would wish to join her; hunt with her.  Mate with her.<br />
<br />
The camera&#39;s follow the shewolf for sometime, these views managing to span somewhat deep in the woodlands as the beast dashes off within from her yard, following for a minute as she runs.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately; the camera&#39;s seem to reach their limit at some point as, while lingering on the last shot of the sprinting beast before it vanishes from its perspective, the stream suddenly dies.  Whether you feel jaded by this sudden blue-ballsing of sorts or relieved that control of this woman&#39;s fate is no longer left in your hands is up to you.  Though; some part of you might be admitting that you wish you could join her too.  After all; wasn&#39;t this your fantasy too?  Didn&#39;t you not only wish to cuddle with a shewolf of your own but...to also be a wolf yourself?  You wonder how those other options would have played out, specifically those [Mate] options left ambiguous to your imagination.<br />
<br />
The website suddenly pings and leaves a odd message for you stating their thanks for viewing and participating in their...bizarre metamorphic experimental services?  The site reminds you that your actions have led to a reasonably good ending for the female participant and that you most likely have suffered little side-effects from your consequences.  What consequences?  What side-effects?  Is the website suggesting that you could have become part of their abnormal services too somehow?<br />
<br />
This WAS just a performed and edited show, right?  Maybe this was the website being cheeky and playing off their erotically quirky themes.  Again; though, you may feel either disappointed or concerned about this message.<br />
<br />
The website goes on to hope you will return to &#39;participant&#39; in future scenarios.  It also adds a line &#39;Pleasant Dreams,&#39; before the web browser suddenly shuts down.  You blink in disbelief, opening up your browser and looking at your history to return...only to find there is no record of the site in its list.  You try typing in the name of the site again...but there are no hits.  It is as if the website just...disappeared.<br />
<br />
No matter what mood you are in after participating, it must be unanimous that the site&#39;s disappearance from the web this quickly is...rather eerie.  Not much can be done about it, and you realize that time has slipped by enough that you should be going to bed.  Which you do...not before embracing this inner urge to strip to your birthday suit and crawl upon your mattress on hands and knees, an unusual yet welcoming need to whine, growl and pant as your lie down and try to drift to sleep.<br />
<br />
You suddenly wake to the cry of a howl in the distance.  You gather onto all fours and watch the sky, the plain ceiling of your bedroom gone now surrounded by leafy canopy and a starry night sky.  You hear the howl once more, understanding the thrill and desire in its song...her song.  You yelp and growl until belting a yearning howl of your own calling back to the shewolf, letting her know you are here and willing to join her.  Even after you push forward and sprint through the woods on your plump animal paws you can hear her reply, eager to meet you; spurring your stride as you wish to meet and greet.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#39;t take long before you come face to face with this lonely shewolf.  There is an odd familiarity to her, as if you&#39;ve seen this wolf once before; desired this bitch not too long ago.  The shewolf approaches, her mood gleeful as she pants excitedly.  Your furry bodies bump and brush, sounding whines and yelps of elation to caress against a fellow wolf.  Your play, tender yet rough, eventually has you tackling the shewolf from behind knocking her to the ground.  She rolls onto her back, her forearms tucked against her chest.  She growls but more out of thrill than annoyance, her soft fury relaxing back to amorous gazes staring back into her golden hues.  She leans in and licks your snout, nuzzling along your muzzle as you mimic her affections; tails wagging, flagging.<br />
<br />
Furry bodies begin to press and rub feverishly, stricken anxiously with a need to grind and enjoy the warmth of each other&#39;s soft pelts; the carnal figures of your feral hides.  Instincts leading eventually to burying your growing red pride past her throbbing dark folds, the wet constricting heat of her temple encapsulating your wolfhood both pleasurable and painful, urgent enough to start pounding quicker and harder needing your bulbous knot to push inside; to be fully entrapped.  Before that happens, the shewolf suddenly resists thrashing underneath and bucking you off, you snarling in frustration to the bitch&#39;s denial.  But that aggression tempers as you see why, your shewolf rising onto all fours but remaining still, looking back with panting maw and seductive feral eyes; her flickering tail raised high reminding you of her animal heat.<br />
<br />
You stretching a wolfish grin, your own drooling pants hovering behind her tail and rump sniffing her intoxicating musk and pheromones as you bath her lupine vulva with your hungry tongue, wetting her folds and making her howl softly in anticipation.  When you feel ready you grasp your forepaws around her hindquarters, leaping onto your hindpaws and bucking behind your shewolf, slipping your forearms around her sides; mounted.  Resting on top your shewolf you resume humping, pounding your wolfhood back through her wet petals feverishly until you feel the knot pop through, the both of your yelping in shock yet in bliss as you continue to pump and rock.<br />
<br />
This is heaven for you.  There is nothing right now but this sheer satisfaction of mating with such a beautiful and horny shewolf, wanting nothing more than to mate as much as the two of you can possibly muster; wanting to succeed in filling her womb and bring your future pups into this world, start your own pack.  Live as wolves.  Be wolf.<br />
<br />
The ecstasy of your eruption has you and your mate howling proudly, embracing this primal lust.  This orgasm is incredible; you can&#39;t wait to recovery and start again, wanting to fill your shewolf until she can no longer take your seed.<br />
<br />
But...you find that might be problem, as you come to your senses.  Or; at least, you realize you not where you want to be.  You face the walls of your bedroom scanning around in a exhausted daze, looking under yourself to discover the shewolf is no longer with you.  You see your forepaws, your fur, the leathery canine shape of your snout, but your loving horny mate is nowhere to be found.  This leaves you enraged, snarling madly in your confusion.  Where has your mate gone?  Why are you not in the woods?  Why are you stuck in this unusual den?<br />
<br />
You spend the next few minutes bounding about the room, sniffing and searching for any sign of your shewolf.  You often swipe at dangling clothes and knick-knacks around the room, sinking your fangs into pillows and other items to thrash and rip apart.  You try for the doorknob, but your forepaws are fully feral unable to grip around the brass circle, your fangs unable to really grasp either.  You consider pounding at the door hoping to break the wood.  You rush to your window clawing at the glass hoping to break through.  But you&#39;re not the same large werewolf like the shewolf from the website&#39;s stream.<br />
<br />
Panicked and furious; you let out a blood-chilling howl hoping your shewolf or other wolves will answer your call and free you from your confines.<br />
<br />
Morning eventually comes...<br />
You groggily wake to find yourself well rested though sore, stretching your limbs with a large yawn.  As you sit up; though, you come to realize that you are not safe in your bedroom as you once remembered passing out in.  Instead; you have somehow woken up in the middle of park.  And your naked.  And covered in some scratches, blotched with some blood...and a dead raccoon carcass lies next to you.  And; to wrap up the bizarre oddity of your situations, you are discovered by a few people crossing by the park, the police quick to arrive.  Though; you manage to convince the officers that you have no understanding of why you are out here like this, let alone the grotesque indications of what you may have done to that poor raccoon.<br />
<br />
Somehow managing to not have your life turned upside-down after that, you eventually come across some news articles about a woman who had be put into a similar scenario.  The photo of this person has a striking resemblance to the woman from that website.  The reporter says that rangers found the young lady deep in the woods after campers nearby reported wolf noises close by afraid for their safety.  The dazed woman was found naked and scratched up as well, though she was surrounded by a few wolves cuddling the confused woman.  And they were not happy at all when the rangers tried to take the naked woman away, having to dart and sedate them before any harm could be done.<br />
<br />
The woman; wishing to remain anonymous, was taken to a hospital to recover, though was then placed under psychiatric care when she began to develop unusual wolf-like behaviors.  She states she is aware of her unusual mood swings and feels something indeed is wrong with her, but the reporter that interviews her claims she didn&#39;t seem all that baffled or upset about.  She even mentions how she hopes the wolves she awoke with are alright, admitting and unhealthy desire to return to them.<br />
<br />
One thing about the interview that leaves you stunned is how the woman mentions having a odd erotic dream about wolves that night.  How she remembers bits and pieces of dreaming of being courted by a rather large wolf-like beast; the terror yet thrill of being taken and turning into one herself.  She mentions how she awoke from that dream into another, experiencing a false awakening where she was back in her bedroom but as a similar wolf-like beast wanting out.  Her memory of that dream is fuzzy, but she recalls escaping into the woodlands, hunting like a wolf, coming across other wolves...behaving like a bitch in heat around these wolves.  The reporter reflects on these comments leaving ambiguous some details the woman&#39;s doctors discovered in their examination.<br />
<br />
You wonder if perhaps you experienced the same primal wet dream that your female participant underwent, getting a taste of your own medicine so to speak.  Though...was that taste embarrassing or rapturous to you?  Do you think your experience could have played out differently if you made different choices for your shewolf?  Or had this all just been one intense coincidental shared dream?<br />
