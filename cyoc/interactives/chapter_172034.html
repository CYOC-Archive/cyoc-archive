<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Honey, I&#39;m an alien.&quot; My girlfriend Emily said, &quot;Although... it&#39;s a little more complicated than that... I think a good place to start would be to show you my... Well it&#39;s not really a ship, but I guess it wouldn&#39;t sound alien to you if I didn&#39;t show you a UFO despite the fact that it&#39;s not really flying.&quot; <br />
&quot;Semantics aside, I suppose I&#39;d like to see that... whatever it is.&quot; <br />
Emily clapped her hands together and said &quot;Oh fun, always being willing to see the evidence. I like that about you Jason.&quot; I was beginning to feel a little weird as Emily started acting a little... not Emily like. &quot;Alright see that slight crack in the wall?&quot; She said pointing.<br />
&quot;Kinda... that really tiny fissure?&quot;<br />
&quot;Touch it while thinking about going into it.&quot; I quickly gave Emily and accusatory look, but either this was going to be a quick gotcha moment or something amazing would happen soon. I moved my hand to the crack and touched it while imagining walking into a UFO, and suddenly I felt myself sucked into the crack in an instant. The next instant I felt myself on a cold hard floor in a sterile cube of metal, and a second later Emily appeared behind me. <br />
Confused I asked &quot;So this is what you use to move around the universe?&quot; <br />
Emily said &quot;Kinda... Let me get out of Emily.&quot; Before I could ask what Emily meant she said &quot;remove HLF from LLF&quot; and suddenly Emily&#39;s body vibrated for a second and then a pool of water appeared next to Emily. <br />
Inside my head a new but still feminine voice spoke &quot;Well this is my form. I expect you&#39;ll think of my as a slime, and because my actual species name would be meaningless to tell you right now. Feel free to call me a slime or use the name I gave myself that you can pronounce Ceil.&quot;<br />
I looked to an embarrassed looking Emily and to this new Ceil and asked &quot;Um... so many questions, but what is the relationship between you two?&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily nodded after a second and said &quot;Well when I was really young I was going to die. Ceil was nearby and used her technology to keep me alive as long as I didn&#39;t tell people about her and that she could live in me. Through the years she&#39;d keep using the technology to provide us a nice safe life, and we&#39;d always keep each other company. Should I also tell him that other thing?&quot;<br />
Ceil spoke into both our minds &quot;I shall tell him my purpose. I know you know about Star Trek where they have all sorts of technology which eliminates most all scarcity. We also have similar technology based on magic.&quot; I was about to ask something to which Ceil said &quot;The species which originally formed our government once found a world where they used honest to goodness magic. After some studying we were able to replicate the phenomena and thus were able to use magic with our technology to do what was once thought impossible. We put a lot of restrictions on the magic technology for obvious reasons, but the result is we have an entire civilization that proposers across galaxies without need of anything. To prove this I would like to offer you a test of sorts.&quot; at which point a door on one of the metal walls appeared. The three of us walked through the door and on the other side was an identical room except there was a small metal box with a bright red button on top. <br />
Curiously I picked the small metal box up and it was about as big as my head and felt maybe five pounds heavy. I asked &quot;What exactly is this test? Did I just fail it?&quot; <br />
Ceil &quot;said&quot; &quot;That is essentially an omnipotence box. It&#39;s not activated yet but the idea of the technology is you press the button, give it a command, and it does what you commanded it to. This one in particular has some training wheel settings, and one major stipulation. It can only affect reality inside this room.&quot; <br />
I had to ask &quot;And how is this not heavily regulated?&quot;<br />
Emily chuckled and said &quot;The fact it can only be used inside a finite space is the heavy regulation. Oh you can do so much with it like... Well I suppose I shouldn&#39;t say. From what I&#39;ve seen most regulations are done so you can&#39;t enforce your will upon others without their consent.&quot;  <br />
Ceil imported the information &quot;The walls and door of this room are effectively indestructible. The omnipotence box is also effectively indestructible, but if you were to really wanted to you could make it destroy itself. The only way for you to open the door is to use the omnipotence box to open the door. All other attempts to make the omnipotence box affect the walls or door will not work. The test ends once the door to this room opens. Do you wish to take this test?&quot; <br />
I asked &quot;Is there a time limit?&quot; <br />
&quot;No there is not, you can have as much time as you wish. Also we will not be watching you while the test is happening.&quot; <br />
&quot;Well then...&quot; I pondered for a moment, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll take the test.&quot; <br />
Ceil said &quot;Great, the test will start as soon as the door closes. Come on Emily.&quot; the liquid being and my girlfriend exited the room and the door closed ceiling the room. Also the red button on the omnipotence box was now glowing. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the door before it sealed Emily asked &quot;Ceil... what exactly did you say the conditions for the door opening was again?&quot; <br />
Ceil said &quot;The door will open under a few conditions. The first is if Jason dies for whatever reason, the second is the door will open once the omnipotence box has been destroyed and a year has passed in the room&#39;s time, and the final condition is if Jason uses the omnipotence box to open it.&quot;<br />
Emily asked &quot;And how fast is the room&#39;s time sped up?&quot; <br />
&quot;As soon as the door closes it will start to open again.&quot; the door to the room was starting to seal and Emily put her hand together in prayer. Ceil was pretty sure every god any human worshiped never existed, but she would need to do some tests on human prayer if everything worked right. As the door shut it started to open slowly at which point Emily  was clenching her teeth hard. She may have been in on the alien thing, but she really liked Jason and hoped he&#39;d be ok. Ceil said &quot;What has happened has happened. We just have to see what the results are.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both a few seconds prior, and a potentially infinite amount of time earlier I was standing in the middle of the room with a small box with a button. Was the test about how creatively I used the box? Was it about if I tried to use the box at all? Was it about if I tried to use it for anything other than getting out? I Jason was not the type of guy to ask those types of questions and instead was about to answer the question &quot;Could this thing change me?&quot; <br />
I pressed the button with my finger and thought to tell it to &quot;Make my dick bigger.&quot;<br />
The omnipotence box in a machine voice asked &quot;How much bigger?&quot; <br />
&quot;Training wheels&quot; I thought, &quot;I suppose I should be as precise&quot; and then imagined my dick being maybe a foot and a half long with maybe egg sized balls and suddenly there was a shifting sensation in my pants. This thing really worked... What could I do? wasn&#39;t a question I was going to ask myself, but the question you should ask as the reader is &quot;How should we continue?&quot;</p>
