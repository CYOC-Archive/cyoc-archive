<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Emma...listen. I know this is all kinda scary, and really new...but I&#39;m fine. I really am.&quot; Jay said, his voice now somewhat more toward effeminate rather than simply androgynous. He really did wonder if anyone would be capable of mistaking the new Jay for a woman. The very idea got Jay feeling mischievous and excited for the idea. It...could be a problem if his manhood acted up, and given how Jay was, that was a sensible concern.<br />
<br />
Emma asked, &quot;So...what now then? I mean, I trust you. I always do! But where do we go from here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay contemplated for a moment. He didn&#39;t want to dive into the deep end really soon, but he did want to see what would come of this. Maybe it would be wise instead to just...see what the general reaction would be. First and foremost. Then he could if he felt comfortable with it go out to the club or something. He knew well enough that the places he frequented had a tendency to get hot and heavy. And for some reason the idea of grinding around in there, and potentially enticing a man with his new feminine figure was just so...alluring.<br />
<br />
Jay wondered what it was.<br />
<br />
Could there be some mental effect going on? Hm, merited some investigation. Jay stated, &quot;I want to head out, see how everyone reacts to the new me. If I want to I can just come home and revert these changes. I want to enjoy them while I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any women&#39;s clothes, Jay?&quot; Emma asked, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I do however...&quot; Jay said with a smirk, &quot;Have some sufficiently unisex clothes.&quot; He promptly got up and retrieved some clothes - a tank top and tight jeans that Jay hadn&#39;t worn in a very long time. Considering everything, Jay figured with these clothes he could pass as a totally normal, new person. He also retrieved an athletic supporter on top of some tight boxers, figuring he needed some insurance against his body acting up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Emma snapped her fingers, &quot;I think you might need a bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I do!&quot; Jay responded, wondering what that was going to be like. &quot;Do you have any spares back at your place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. I got one that was a little big for me, but I think it&#39;d be about your size...&quot; Emma realized how weird all this was, but she figured Jay knew what he was doing. &quot;Let me just head back to my place and get it, on top of some other clothes, just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma hurried out, and Jay sat in waiting as he heard her starting up her car outside. This really was an incredible opportunity to explore something no other guys were gonna get to explore. He&#39;d always wondered what it was like...now he had a rack of his own to feel up on demand, and he was still buff enough to assuage his ego. Jay looked in his mirror again and contemplated his face.<br />
<br />
Hmm.<br />
<br />
He could stand to be a little more feminine in his facial features if he really wanted to seem like someone he&#39;d date. Maybe some make up would help out a bit...huh, weird thoughts there. Jay cupped his chin and then tried to flex again for the mirror. He was easily a step over androgynous toward feminine looking...but as he grinned at himself it was obvious he didn&#39;t particularly act feminine. Well, he could imitate, but when it came down to it, Jay still regarded himself with the libido and identification of a horny college man.<br />
<br />
In waiting for Emma, Jay started to do some push ups of various types. He giggled a little when his breasts pushed against the ground, noting how he felt doing these. Fuuuck yes. The gym would be a perfect place to head. He could swagger out and around, and then head to the gym and see how some of his old lifting buddies responded to &quot;Jaylene&quot;.<br />
<br />
He was still quite boyish looking and really fucking buff (especially for a woman), but in terms of looks he easily surmised he would appear to be one of the prettier girls at the college.<br />
<br />
Jay heard the sound of the car returning. He eagerly met Emma at the door, and she handed over her bra. &quot;I&#39;ll help you put it on...&quot; She seemed to be acclimating well to this now. She looked him over in his clothes, realizing she couldn&#39;t really recognize Jay right now as anyone but another woman. She did remember he still had his most vital piece as far as she was concerned, but with how Jay looked you could be forgiven for assuming he had a pussy instead.<br />
<br />
The act of putting on a bra for his new figure was something more difficult than Jay had ever expected it to be. He realized now how things really were for Emma and other women. But before long he had it on.<br />
<br />
After the shirt came on again, Jay went to the computer to lock the computer until he returned, just in case anyone else tried to use it. While he was there, he promptly put on some new exercise shoes he&#39;d never really worn yet. Smaller than his usual, but with his feet as they were, he could fit in them pretty well actually.<br />
<br />
Jay started to lead the way out. &quot;What do you say we have a girls&#39; day out, Emma?&quot; He was teasing of course, but Emma was starting to wonder. Were there effects on his mind? Would he still be the Jay she remembered? <br />
<br />
As soon as they were outside and moving for a bit, Jay beaming and enjoying the trickery he was employing here, Emma noted a few guys from the college were checking out Jay. She cooled her jets though, knowing he was into women...hoping he was, really. Because it seemed he was enjoying this maybe a bit much...</p>
