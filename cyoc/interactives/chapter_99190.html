<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After dinner, Ben helped his moms clean the table, then asked to be excused while Samantha and Frances worked on cleaning the dishes.<br />
By the time they were on the last of the pots and pans, Ben came back into the kitchen. He was completely naked, but in his werewolf form, which towered over both ladies at slightly over 8 feet, considering he was still a teenager. He had his backpack of human belongings in one paw, and his cellphone on its lanyard around his neck.<br />
&quot;Okay. Have fun, but—&quot; began Samantha.<br />
&quot;I know. Be back by curfew. Tomorrow&#39;s a school day,&quot; Ben said, finishing the usual statement for her with a smile. &quot;My alarm&#39;s set so I&#39;ll be back home in time, but I wish someone would make these things wolf size,&quot; he added, showing how small the phone looked in the palm of his paw.<br />
&quot;Maybe someday,&quot; replied Frances, wishfully, as their son kissed both moms on their respective cheeks.<br />
Then he let out a slight howl as he left the back door into the open field behind their house.<br />
&quot;So,&quot; said Samantha, slinking up against her wife. &quot;What would you like to do tonight?&quot; she asked, as she began playfully nibbling at Frances&#39; ear.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what,&quot; began Frances, as she started rubbing her nose against Samantha&#39;s, &quot;why don&#39;t you go into the living room and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Moments later, Samantha Twist was hurriedly stripping off her clothes and laying them in a hastily folded pile in one of the dining room chairs.<br />
Now nude, she spread her arms and legs and shuddered in pure pleasure as Samantha released her inner werecat, relishing and rejoicing in every moment of the transformation as fur spread across her body. She let out a small purr of contentment as her tail finished forming and her facial features assumed their feline shape.<br />
Next she turned off all the lights and, despite the fact cats can see in the dark, lit a few candles in strategic locations for romantic atmosphere. Then, Samantha turned on the stereo. Since it wasn&#39;t quite 7 pm yet, the local college radio station had not begun its nightly program of smooth, romantic jazz that she and Frances liked, but didn&#39;t bother changing the station. Then, after moving the coffee table away from the sofa (just in case) Samantha sat against the arm rest facing the kitchen door, her tail and whiskers twitching in anticipation of what was to come.<br />
Although always impatient for her wife, it was just a couple of minutes before Frances appeared. The other Mrs. Twist was already in her werecat form as she carried her clothing to lay next to Samantha&#39;s. Giving a little spin by the kitchen door so her wife could see all her werecat charms, Frances smiled before going back into the kitchen. She returned with an open bottle of grape juice, two long stemmed wine glasses, and coasters for everything.<br />
After setting things up on the coffee table and pouring the drinks, Frances handed a glass to Samantha before she sat in her wife&#39;s lap and purred in contentment.<br />
&quot;To us,&quot; said Frances, as the happy couple clinked their glasses together.<br />
After a brief sip, Samantha looked deep into her wife&#39;s green eyes and asked, &quot;So, what do you want to do tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re doing it,&quot; replied Frances, nuzzling her head against Samantha&#39;s. &quot;As much as I value our growing friendship and love with Martha Anderson, I thought that after everything that&#39;s been going on of late, we could use some quiet time alone, together.&quot;<br />
&quot;Whether my loving wife or concerned therapist, you&#39;re always looking out for me and us,&quot; said Samantha with a smile, as she kissed Frances.<br />
&quot;Samantha,&quot; began Frances, running her free paw through her wife&#39;s hair and caressing her furry ears, &quot;when my family first moved to Moon Lake, I may not have known what a lesbian, let alone a werecat, was at the time; but I instantly knew from the moment I first saw you across the street from our place that I loved you and that we were meant to be together. Then, now, and forever. Ben and Martha have enriched our lives in ways that we never could have foreseen and will never forget, but in the end it always comes back to you and me,&quot; said Frances, before kissing her.<br />
When Frances broke the kiss, she was surprised to see Samantha crying. As the one who was usually the &quot;stronger&quot; of the two, this was a rare event.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy,&quot; admitted Samantha, handing her wife the empty glass so she could wipe her eyes. &quot;The two of us...&quot;<br />
Samantha paused before adding, &quot;I thought I knew love, because I told you about the only relationship I ever had before you moved to town, but knew I was totally wrong about that the moment you introduced yourself. Being with you is like...&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay dear,&quot; said Frances, while sitting her glass down. &quot;I know how you feel,&quot; she added, curling up in Samantha&#39;s arms. &quot;The fact you still get tongue tied after all these years is kind of cute,&quot; she said, taking her wife&#39;s right paw within her left.<br />
Samantha&#39;s free hand began lovingly caressing the fur of Frances&#39; back as she said, &quot;Do you know how many trees I probably killed trying to come up with the right thing to say when you wanted us to recite our own vows at our wedding?&quot;<br />
&quot;I could probably hazard a guess,&quot; said Frances, as her free arm reached around Samantha&#39;s neck to hold her closer. <i>&quot;You are the first thought that crosses my mind each morning, and the last I remember before falling to sleep each night. As it should be, my heart is in sync with yours, for it never truly was alive until the moment we met. From now, until the end of time, we are one. Completing each other for all eternity.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;And I remember what you wrote,&quot; said Samantha, not bothering to stop her tears. <i>&quot;My life and love are yours, for they are the greatest gifts I can ever offer another, and you are the only one I have ever found worthy. Treasure them as much as I treasure you.&quot;</i><br />
Not another word was spoken as the Twists kissed and held each other close.<br />
In time, Frances began licking the tears off Samantha&#39;s furry cheeks, as the other woman laid back on the couch to let her wife be the dominant partner of the moment.<br />
Silently, Frances continued kissing and caressing her wife, the smooth jazz music from the stereo being the only noise in the room.<br />
Samantha just laid there, enjoying the pleasures received and giving what she could in return, Frances&#39; weight a comfort against hers as their smooth fur mingled together.<br />
Although their mouths never parted company, soon Frances coaxed her wife&#39;s legs open, letting their very moist vaginas rub against their counterpart&#39;s.<br />
In time, as hardened nipples pressed against hardened nipples and different pairs of lips caressed their mates, soon Samantha and Frances shuddered in the mutual pleasure of simultaneously achieving orgasmic bliss together, their tails intertwining as tightly as their bodies.<br />
<br />
As the evening progressed; whether it was Samantha as the dominant partner, a mutual and highly enjoyable session of oral sex with feline tongues probing deeply into each other&#39;s pussy as tails teased their partner&#39;s rear, or just holding each other close in the after glow, the knowing look of love between Samantha and Frances Twist were the only &#39;words&#39; exchanged.<br />
<br />
When Ben came home a little after 10 pm, still in his werewolf form, he was surprised to find his mothers sound asleep on the couch in their werecat forms.<br />
The two women were within each others furry arms with happy smiles on their faces and actually purring in unison as they slept!<br />
Ben shifted back into his human form and took a couple of discreet (only from the shoulders up) photos of the happy couple with his cellphone, then went quietly to his room with a happy smile on his face as well.<br />
