<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I just wanted to workout,&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wo-workout?&quot; Nick&#39;s face lost a little bit of color. <br />
<br />
Matt noticed it. &quot;Is that alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Nick answered. &quot;I just did a light workout this morning so I&#39;m fine to do another. Maybe you can keep up with me this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was that confidence that Matt knew, even adding a quip to push Matt further. But, for a second there, Nick had almost felt like a bit of a different person. Almost like he was some scarred little nerd who&#39;d been afraid of working out. Sure, Nick had some &#39;dorky&#39; hobbies, but he had a superhero&#39;s body. All the way down to the unrealistic proportions. He could go to any comic book convention and easily dress up like one of the characters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing!&quot; Matt felt himself following behind the other man like a puppy. He stared at the wide back filling one of his old shirts. It looked like it was straining, almost ready to tear. The fabric was stretched to its limits showing the deep grooves in Nick&#39;s back. It wasn&#39;t until turned around again that Matt realized what he was doing. He felt his face go red and instantly looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;So upper, lower or mixed splits?&quot; Nick asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mi-mixed,&quot; Matt answered. &quot;Coach had us running drills today so just a little of both should be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing double duty?&quot; Nick said. Matt felt himself nod. &quot;Good boy. Hard work always pays off!&quot; One of Nick&#39;s hands ran through Matt&#39;s hair. Even though Matt was no small man, he suddenly felt like he was half Nick&#39;s size. Matt had played football all his life. He&#39;d made sure that he was always the alpha stud, but right now he wanted to drop to his knees. However, he fought the urge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah!&quot; Matt said. A smile crept onto his face. His face still burned red, but his body loved the attention the other man was giving him. His yearning on the car ride over had primed him for the situation. &quot;I need to be strong for coach.&quot; He felt a bit a cringe run through him. When was he ever trying to impress other guys? His whole life had been for girls, but right now he couldn&#39;t help but hope to get another compliment from Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s get started,&quot; Nick said. He went over to the set of dumbbells and picked them up. They were far heavier than anything Matt would have been okay using at the moment. But Nick powered through like it was nothing. Deep grunts followed through as he pushed himself through the twelve reps. Each set caused his veins to bulge a bit more. Sweat dripped down over his smooth skin, soaking the shirt he was wearing. <br />
<br />
Matt did his best to keep up. But after the second or third exercise, Nick didn&#39;t seem to be paying attention to him in the slightest. Nick was in the zone. He was completely unaware of anything other than the weights and pumping up his muscles. And with each new exercise, he only seemed to gain more energy. And more need to push himself even further. The distinct smell of his sweat filled the room. With that, Matt also found himself zoning out. No longer focusing on the workout but his workout partner. His mind drifted as he sat on the bench and one of his hands pawed at his crotch. <br />
<br />
An hour passed and Nick finished the workout. He breathed heavily. Then the light came back in his eyes. &quot;Oh shit,&quot; he cursed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not what it looks like!&quot; Matt instantly defended himself, though the tent in his shorts was almost impossible to hide.<br />
<br />
Nick didn&#39;t seem to respond. Instead, it was just with a series of guttural and painful sound grunts. He gripped onto a piece of equipment, grinding his teeth. His blood seemed to be pumping even faster. Sweat dripped from his brow. That&#39;s when his muscles bulged. Bulged bigger than they had been. The shirt that was already straining against his body started to rip as its contents were growing. With each passing second, Nick started to gain more and more weight. And with that every muscle grew.<br />
<br />
His arms tore through the sleeves. His back burst through the back. And his shoes couldn&#39;t contain his feet anymore. His big toe pushed out of its confines and wiggled about in the open air. Still, he grunted and groaned as the size of his muscles kept growing. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-hat&#39;s wrong?&quot; Matt rushed over to his friend. The sounds only turned him on even more, but he still wanted to comfort his friend.<br />
<br />
Nick took a few deep and heavy breaths. &quot;I&#39;m bigger...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...?&quot; Matt looked the other man up and down. When Nick stood at his full 6&#39;5&quot; height, Matt couldn&#39;t tell what was different. It didn&#39;t matter that over the course of that last 20 seconds or so he&#39;d gained about 15 more pounds of pure muscle, making his already rippling body that much bigger. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me!&quot; Nick shouted. Matt didn&#39;t need to be told twice. He stared at his bodybuilder friend with great intent. &quot;I&#39;m bigger! Every time I use these weights, I get bigger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s kind of how working out goes,&quot; Matt said. He was trying to lighten the mood but didn&#39;t seem to do much. &quot;But it&#39;s the weights? The weights you ordered from that website?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man. Since I got them, I haven&#39;t been able to stop working out and every time I do, I get bigger. Significantly bigger,&quot; Nick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s a bad thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick glared. &quot;When I ordered them a couple of days ago, how much do you think I weighed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt took a second thinking this must have been some kind of trick question. But at the same time, he knew there had to be something about the website. After all he had something similar happening to him. But looking over his friend, he couldn&#39;t quite place it. Nick was pretty much a bodybuilder. Everything but name at the moment. He could stand on any stage and easily knock out the competition. Those strong arms and thick built chest were amazing to look at. And then somehow he was able to keep perfectly cut abs despite being absolutely massive. And then those legs. Thicker than anything. If he wasn&#39;t so tall, it&#39;d be nearly impossible for him to walk as they&#39;d grind up against each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;255?&quot; Matt shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;130. I weighed 130 pounds,&quot; Nick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way!&quot; Matt backed off for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes fucking way! Something about these weights keep making me want to work out and then I get bigger. I can&#39;t stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit man... That&#39;s crazy...&quot; Nick said. &quot;And it was the website?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. But I don&#39;t get it. How can something like this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno,&quot; Nick said. <br />
<br />
&quot;But you believe me?&quot; Matt asked. &quot;No one else has noticed yet. They just think I&#39;m a wierdo cause I don&#39;t have any clothes that fit me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Nick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick felt his face flush red. Somehow Matt still hadn&#39;t noticed his throbbing dick. Seeing the man be shirtless and sweaty in front of him was doing all sorts of things to his body. &quot;Just cause,&quot; Nick answered. Though he quickly changed the subject. &quot;Do you think we should try ordering something else? Do you think that&#39;d stop this? Or make it worse?&quot;</p>
