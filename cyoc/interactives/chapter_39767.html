<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna, more then ever, wanted to investigate the doll house. &quot;Something is off about it,&quot; she told herself as she removed her clothes, except for her underwear and reached into the dresser for a pair of tights.<br />
<br />
Next she went to the closet and got out a dress and looking at the doll house, trying to figure out what was off about it, she pulled the dress on. Sitting down on her bed, she began to slip the tights on and just as she stood up to pull the all the way on, she realized something; &quot;The doll house looks more like a real house,&quot; Anna muttered to herself as she began to walk toward it.<br />
<br />
Sitting down in front of the toy, she was just reaching out to once again undo the latch, when her sister Amelia entered, drinking something that looked like milk.<br />
<br />
Seeing her sister sitting on the floor, presumably playing with her toys, Amelia demanded, &quot;Come on Anna! You can play later, okay? Mother wants to take us out for dinner!&quot; As she said the last part, she reached down to grab her sisters shoulder.<br />
<br />
Just as Amelia touched Anna's shoulder, Anna touched the front of the doll house. Anna jerked, causing Amelia to jerk and the cup of milk to go flying into the air. As it fell back to the purple and white carpet, it slowed, stopped and then everything around the two girls went white and both were lost in feelings of pleasure.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
As this happened, Joy sat in the library trying to come up with an answer to her problems. Suddenly she felt really weird. A tight, bloating feeling could be felt in her groin and in her lower abdomen. Suddenly a pinching sensation could be felt in her penis and testicles. Fumbling about, she picked up her back pack, thought to herself, &quot;I need to find the ladies room,&quot; and stumbled out of the library, looking for the nearest bathroom.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Anna was confused because she thought she was laying on concrete. Looking up she saw a pale white full moon floating far above her. &quot;But that can't be right,&quot; she told herself as she stood up.<br />
<br />
Looking about, she found herself looking out at an odd purple and white lawn. Behind her was a door to a house. Blinking, she suddenly realized that she was looking at the carpet to her room and the white moon far above was actually Amelia's glass of milk, permanently frozen in place. &quot;I've shrunk down to about a foot high,&quot; Ann wailed out loud.<br />
<br />
Turning back to look at the door, her sense of height shifted and she thought that she was still about fifty five inches tall. Turning back to the carpet, it just made her dizzy to have the sense of height shift. Looking back at the house, she reached up and rang the buzzer and was just about to knock, when she thought, &quot;Why should I knock? This is my doll house after all.&quot; And with that thought, she reached up and pulled on the latch, something that looked more realistic then ever, and opened the door.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Amelia was confused. For starters, there was the white light and the sensation of pleasure. Then after that was the feeling of being wet. When her vision returned, she found herself sitting in a hot tub full of warm water. As she sat there, wondering what had just happened, when the jets started and the water began to froth and boil.<br />
<br />
As it became hotter and hotter, and Amelia started to really enjoy this, she all of  sudden sat up and thought, &quot;No! I need to find Anna. Not sit here in a hot tub and enjoy myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Climbing out, Amelia noted that her clothes had changed from a lovely periwinkle blue dress, white tights and a purple wool coat to a skimpy looking bikini with padding in the bra area that made it look like she had an A cup. Figuring she couldn't wander around like this, she started for the cabana, hoping that there was some clothes inside.<br />
<br />
Taking off the bikini, Amelia gasped as she saw that it wasn't padding, but that she did in fact have two small mounds of flesh, roughly the size of an A cup and they were sensitive. &quot;What the hell is going on here,&quot; Amelia though angerly as she reached for a Sarong. Seeing that the lower half was practically see through, Amelia also took the underwear laying next to the dress.<br />
<br />
Clothed, she stepped out and took in her surroundings. She was standing on a back deck, looking out at first a green lawn, but at the same time it looked like a purple and white carpet. &quot;Almost like it's Anna's doll house looking out at the carpet,&quot; Amelia thought as she turned, not fully understanding what she was seeing, and began walking across the deck toward a pair of sliding doors. Opening them, she found herself looking in on a kitchen. And then she screamed as she saw the people sitting at the table.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Anna was wandering the living room, trying to decide where to go. She'd entered and found herself in a large front hall, complete with a crystal chandelier. From there was a large foyer with a grand staircase that followed the left wall upward. A hallway on the right led deeper into the house and two doors, one to a dining room and the other to a living room, led off the foyer.<br />
<br />
It was about this time Anna discovered that somehow her clothes had been changed. No longer wearing a white and red dress with tights, she was now dressed in a pair of tight jeans that had the legs rolled up to just below her knees, exposing her lower legs. For a shirt she had on a tight blue button down tank top, that was tied at the hem, exposing her midriff. &quot;Wondering, &quot;What the hell is going on here,&quot; she entered the living room.<br />
<br />
Coffee table, davenport, sofa and a wingback chair, the room gave off a aura that this room was for sitting and talking quietly, not for anything else. On the wall across from the door she'd just entered was an ornate fireplace, complete with real logs ready to be lit. To her immediate left was a secretary and beyond that she could see a door that swung back and forth, &quot;Most likely leading into the kitchen,&quot; Anna thought. It was just about this time that she heard the scream, a shrill sound of deep terror.<br />
<br />
Running back out into the hall, vertigo washed over Anna as the house began to shift. Before her eyes, the foyer grew in size and the staircase pulled away from the wall, doubled in size and centered itself into the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
Anna could still see the dining room on the other side of the hall, but it looked bigger, more ritzy. The foyer now had two hallways, one on each side of the stairs. Choosing the one on the right side of the stairs, the closer of the two, she made her way toward the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Inside, she found herself looking at a large and important kitchen. But what caught her attention where the people. Or more correctly, what she thought were people.<br />
<br />
Three were sitting at a table and another was looking at the others, mouth open but no noise issuing forth. And then Anna realized that the ones at the table were nothing more then dolls and the one standing was in fact her sister. Anna blinked and the odd plastic, rubbery look disappeared from her sister. As she walked over to her sister, Anna thought, &quot;For second there, Amelia almost looked like one of those posable dolls she owns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning Amelia around, Anna asked, &quot;What the hell is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia opened and closed her mouth a couple more times, blinked and then replied, &quot;Anna? Is that really you? You know what mother says about that kind of language.&quot; and then fainted.<br />
<br />
Anna looked down at her unconscious sister, thought something looked different about her, beside the fact that she looked a little like a posable doll, and then asked herself, &quot;Now what are we suppose to do and how do we get ourselves out of this mess?&quot;</p>
