<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was amazing, Rachel thought glumly, that even after literal weeks of experiencing such mind-blowing orgasms, how good it could still feel. <br />
<br />
Ever since that encounter with the hateful witch, Kate, Brooke had taken to Rachel with renewed gusto - and given that Brooke had used her almost daily before that point...now, it was multiple times a day, sometimes with marathon sessions that left Rachel adrift in a pleasurable haze, constantly frustrated at how she could do nothing to actually act on it. <br />
<br />
And it was, of course, Kate&#39;s fault for this too. She&#39;d used some of her magic to let Brooke feel a fraction of the pleasure that Rachel was constantly feeling. And since then, Brooke had been insatiable. The more pleasure Rachel felt, the better it felt for Brooke - creating a hellish loop of helpless pleasurable bliss for the young woman turned sex doll. Almost every night Brooke ended up collapsing on top of Rachel&#39;s silicone form, exhausted from the pleasure she couldn&#39;t seem to break herself away from.<br />
<br />
In those moments where Brooke was focused on something else, Rachel found herself alternating between rage and fear; rage at the fact Kate had given the means to do this to Brooke in the first place. Rage at the fact that Kate had threatened to go after her sister. And absolute fear that she already had - the idea of her sister, just entering her senior of high school, being subjected to this hell...and it was so frustrating to know she couldn&#39;t do anything about it. Hell, she couldn&#39;t even get properly worked up about anything. With her inanimate body, it wasn&#39;t as though her heart could start beating faster with anxiety - she didn&#39;t have one. her breathing didn&#39;t pick up - she didn&#39;t have to. She couldn&#39;t even fucking pass out - sleep was denied to her now - she could only lie there and stare blankly ahead, just like she had been for weeks, and as she would for weeks...months...years more. Unless Brooke had a change of heart or Kate grew a conscience - neither of which was likely - she was stuck but good. <br />
<br />
Brooke seemed to be particularly distracted today, which was unusual. Normally she couldn&#39;t go more than a couple of hours without fucking Rachel. From her limited vantage point on the bed, she could see Brooke going back and forth - organizing her clothes, dusting some things - at one point she even cleaned off Rachel&#39;s form, which sent pleasurable spikes through her (and turned Brooke into a quivering mess, resulting in her having to take a shower afterwards). <br />
<br />
At one point, Brooke wandered off for a moment, and she could hear some shuffling from elsewhere in the house.<br />
<br />
And then, another voice. One she recognized.<br />
<br />
Sofia. <br />
<br />
Rachel felt like crying. So this was finally it. Brooke was going to turn their fellow friend into a sex doll as well, using the same potion that had been used on Rachel. The fact that Brooke would do this even once...<br />
<br />
&quot;So...look. I asked you over here for a reason,&quot; Brooke said from just outside the door. &quot;A week ago, we had lunch, and you told me you were worried about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember,&quot; Sofia said. &quot;It was true then, and it&#39;s true now. Talk to me, Brooke. I want to help, if I can! I miss Rachel too, and you&#39;re just as much a friend as she was. I know her going missing threw you for a loop, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, well, see...what&#39;s been going on with me both has everything and nothing to do with the fact that Rachel is missing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Okay...&quot; Sofia said after a moment. &quot;I&#39;m confused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not...going to believe what I have to tell and show you. But I promise you, it&#39;s true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; came Sofia&#39;s voice, sounding a bit confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel...isn&#39;t missing...&quot;<br />
<br />
A long moment of silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s not missing. Rachel. She&#39;s...she&#39;s in my room. She&#39;s been with me since she was reported missing. But-- Sofia, wait!&quot; <br />
<br />
The door slammed open.<br />
<br />
Sofia wasn&#39;t particularly tall, but she was quite the beauty - at one point, Rachel had a crush on the girl. Sofia had been an out and proud lesbian since middle school. She oozed confidence, bedding bi-girls and straight girls alike. She had the lightly tanned skin of her Italian father, the dark black, slightly curly hair of her mother, and deep, soulful brown eyes. <br />
<br />
Eyes that were, presently, looking at Rachel. At first, it was a look of utter disgust, her face wrinkling up and her eyes narrowing in disbelief and horror - a distinctly odd, if not understandable expression for one to have upon seeing Rachel&#39;s inanimate form. Then it was confusion, which quickly morphed into open curiosity, before finally settling on anger. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Brooke. Explain. NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Rachel,&quot; Brooke said lovingly, reaching out to stroke Rachel on the arm. Rachel hated the sense of pleasure that simple touch sent through her. She longed to talk to Sofia, to beg for a rescue, to warn her - but she could do nothing. She could just lie there and listen. <br />
<br />
Sofia shook her head, and then pinched her nose, letting out a quick angry breath. &quot;Brooke, what the fucking fuck are you... you can&#39;t really... of all the fucking... okay...you...you brought me here to show me something important, and...you...you...&quot; She let out a long sigh. &quot;Brooke! What in the actual fucking fuck?! You bought...a sex doll...that looks like our missing friend?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke opened her mouth to speak, but Sofia waved a hand angrily to cut her off. <br />
<br />
&quot;You. Bought. A sex doll. That. Looks. Like. Our. MISSING. FRIEND! And you don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to find it weird?! That I&#39;m going to think you&#39;ve fucking lost your mind?? Why in the fuck would you even do something like this? Why would you think this is okay? Jesus, Brooke! I knew you liked Rachel, but this is just...it&#39;s weird, and wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke closed her eyes for a moment. &quot;Sofia...that&#39;s not what this is. I told you it&#39;s going to be hard to believe. And I don&#39;t think you were listening properly before. I didn&#39;t get a sex doll that looks like Rachel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, have you taken a look at--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This IS Rachel.&quot;<br />
<br />
A heavy silence fell in the room. Sofia looked across the room at Brooke, who was standing there earnestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Sofia finally said, eyes narrowing. &quot;...What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke smiled softly. &quot;This isn&#39;t a sex doll who looks like Rachel,&quot; she said. &quot;It IS Rachel. Right here. She&#39;s the doll. She&#39;s the doll, but she can still see us and hear us right now. She can feel every touch, feel every sensation. I met a witch and I paid her to make a spell that would transform Rachel into my sex doll. She&#39;s...she&#39;s been here the whole time. I knew she was never missing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia was silent still, looking down at Rachel, and then up at Brooke. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not making this up!&quot; Brooke protested, sounding a bit hurt now. &quot;This...it&#39;s Rachel! Just...look at her! Look at how realistic she is! The tits might be bigger - I think that was Kate&#39;s special touch on the spell, not my request - not that I&#39;m complaining - but it&#39;s her! I went over to her house that day, and carried her back over - remember the story about how Rachel was here for a sleepover? Well...I guess that was kind of true. It&#39;s just, she never left that sleepover. We&#39;ve been having the best sleepovers ever since!&quot; Brooke let out a sigh. &quot;I&#39;ve felt some of what she can feel, Sofia...it&#39;s...incredible...constant, unending pleasure...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frowning, Sofia looked down at Rachel&#39;s face. It was maddening - from within her silicone body, Rachel wanted to shout and scream at Sofia - run away, run away, Brooke is fucking crazy, she wants to do this to you too! Believe her, and get the fuck out of here! Get out of here, find the authorities, find a way to stop this from happening to anyone else! <br />
<br />
But Sofia didn&#39;t move, her frown growing deeper, before her eyes widened a bit. &quot;No, there&#39;s no way,&quot; she muttered. <br />
<br />
And that was when Brooke took a hand out from behind her back to reveal a small bottle of liquid - looking just like the bottle that had done this to Rachel. Rachel could distinctly remember the smell of the lilacs. How she&#39;d spilled it on her body, having no idea what it was at the time, or who had delivered it. She knew now - and she unfortunately knew exactly what the shit could do to a person. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is what did it,&quot; Brooke said. She looked up at Sofia steadily. <br />
<br />
Tea looked at the bottle, then down at Rachel. She seemed to be weighing over something in her mind. It was an awkward moment of silence, with the only noise coming from the fan above. Almost comically, Rachel was sitting there, still with that half aroused/half confused expression stuck on her face, fully naked, exposing her silicone body to the two silent girls on either side of the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s say I believe you,&quot; Sofia said slowly, looking down at Rachel. Her voice was flat, and it was impossible to tell whether or not Sofia did or did not believe Brooke. &quot;And this is really Rachel...&quot; She looked up at Brooke. &quot;Why...did you bring me here to tell me?&quot; Her eyes narrowed. &quot;Why tell me this? Whether I believe you or not...I find it curious...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke slowly smiled. &quot;Well...&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s funny you should ask...&quot;</p>
