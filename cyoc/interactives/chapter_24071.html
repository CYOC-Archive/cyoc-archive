<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jordan couldn't believe it.  Was he actually growing taller?  His heart racing, Jordan closed the door to his room and pulled off his pants, which had grown tight around his enlarging legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he said, feeling his calves.  They had become thick and hard as a rock.  Looking in the mirror, he could tell that he was definitely taller.  Probably about 5'10&quot; by now...  Jordan just stood in disbelief.  He looked down to his feet, which were expanding at a rapid rate, going from their formal size of 8 up to size tens....even more to size twelves....still growing....size fifteen....bigger and bigger...his feet stopped growing when they reached size twenty.  Jordan could not contain his excitement.  He nearly jumped for joy.  <br />
<br />
The growth, however, seemed to have stopped.  Jordan looked at his reflection...he looked pretty goofy with a tiny upper body and huge legs...but had his growth really stopped there?<br />
<br />
Disappointed, Jordan sat down on his bed.  Soon enough, though, he began to feel a tightness in his arms.  Excited, he stood up and ran back over to the mirror.  He felt his stick-like arms as they began to fill out the sleeves of his t-shirt.  Veins began to pop out along his forearms and snaked up to his biceps, which continued to expand.  He flexed his arms and when he did, the sleeves, which were stretched to their limits, burst, revealing his massive shoulders.<br />
<br />
His arms looked amazing.  His once scrawny limbs had become enormous pythons of muscle, measuring at least 25 inches around.  His hands, which were still growing, quickly became larger than a full-grown man's feet.  With his new hands, Jordan felt his new arms.  They were perfect.  He couldn't wait for what would happen next.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jordan felt a pain shoot through his chest.  Knowing what to expect, he pulled off his shirt and stared at his thin, bony chest.  Surely enough, that began to change.  Slowly, his protruding ribs began to vanish under the expanding muscle that was building within Jordan's chest.  His once flat pectoral muscles began to round off as they expanded.  Jordan flexed his chest, which caused the growth to accelerate.  His pecs began to swell rapidly, forming huge mounds of muscle.  A pain in his stomach led to the expansion of his abdominals, which popped up one by one, forming a defined eight-pack that any runner would kill for.<br />
<br />
Jordan viewed himself in the mirror.  His body was spectacular.  He was bigger than anyone he had ever seen!  At a height of 6'4&quot;, Jordan was content with his frame, but he still had the face of a young boy.  He was also lacking body hair.  Suddenly, Jordan began to feel itchy.<br />
<br />
Immediately, hair started to sprout up all over Jordan's body; his legs and arms becoming even hairier than his father's.  On his face, stubble began to appear, and his sideburns became visible.  Jordan's pale skin dimmed and he took on a beautiful, tan glow.  The area around his genitals was especially hairy, so he decided to take off his briefs: the last article of clothing remaining on his new body.<br />
<br />
His dick, by this time, had become erect.  Compared to his new, massive body, his 5 inch penis seemed tiny.  Pubic hair sprouted all around the organ, and, finally, his cock started to grow.  The feeling was unbelievable, like having a continuous orgasm.  Jordan moaned as his boyish member expanded, past 6 inches, past 7...it felt great--Jordan was about to explode with pleasure.  His dick continued to grow.  It was at 10 inches now! Guys everywhere would be envious of him!  Still growing...11 inches....12.....13....14....15 inches.<br />
<br />
His dick was FIFTEEN inches long!  Jordan sank to the floor and stared at his reflection in the mirror.  It was over.  He was.....he was so....<br />
<br />
BIG.<br />
<br />
He just sat there, dazed, looking over his new self.  He was enormous.  Everything about him was huge.  His arms, his legs, his feet, his hands, his cock.....Oh, god, his cock......he could probably reach it with his.....<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jordan again felt a weird sensation pulsing throughout his massive body.  He stood up, and began to shake rapidly.  His 6'4&quot; frame had begun to expand again.  Was he seriously getting bigger?<br />
<br />
Inches were  being packed onto his height.  He was now 6'7&quot; and still growing.  He looked around the room and noticed everything seem to shrink as he continued to grow taller and taller.  Now at 6'9&quot;, he felt enormous, yet continued to grow.....<br />
<br />
6'10.....6'11.....7 feet!!  He was 7 feet tall and still getting bigger!  7'3..7'5...7'6...His head almost reached the ceiling now, and Jordan was forced to crouch down.....7'7...7'8....7'9...7'11.....<br />
<br />
Jordan stopped growing at 8 feet tall.<br />
<br />
He was exhilarated.  Jordan was absolutely gigantic!!  He looked down at his now 18 inch boner and grasped it...he could take it no longer.  Taking the huge organ in both hands, Jordan leaned over and took the head of his monster dick to his lips.  It tasted so good.  The precum that had formed on the tip of his cock had a taste that was too delicious to describe.  Hungry for more, Jordan thrust the giant penis into his mouth, sucking and sucking.  Before long, Jordan came and sent what seemed to be a gallon of semen down his throat.  <br />
<br />
He screamed out in ecstasy as his penis pumped continuously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jordan?!&quot; came the voice of his brother.  &quot;What the fuck, man?  What are you doing in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan raced to his feet, trying to hide, but it was too late....<br />
<br />
Jackson had entered the room.</p>
