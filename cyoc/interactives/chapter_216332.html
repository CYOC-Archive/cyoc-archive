<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas stirred with the smell, the musk of seminal fluid and it&#39;s taste as he did his best to keep his relay teammates on edge while fingering their prostate with his seven inch index finger while underwater in the pool. Thomas did not know why it tasted so good, but he was sure his symbiote of a partial host was the cause. Memories of doing this for a few years began to become clearer as the evening swim practice wore on. Thomas&#39;s focused effort yielded about a quart of mostly seminal fluid and a slight bit of immature semen from the other members of his swim family. Thomas did his five miles of laps after the other three were too weak to swim and just sat on the shallow end to keep Thomas from milking them anymore. The pool was open until eleven each night, but it was always best to be out of the pool by 9:30 so he had time to shower off and drive home. Thomas watched the clock as he had just over ten more minutes to do as many laps as he could after making his required 5 miles, roughly 352 lengths in the 25 yard lap pool. Thomas swam as fast as he could, but could only manage 94 lengths in ten minutes. Thomas was coughing out the water in his lungs as he joined his still recovering teammates at the ladder. One by one, Thomas helped each of them climb out of the pool, all of them amazed at what they just saw, the fastest human swimmer ever.<br />
<br />
Mark, the shortest of the relay team at 6ft 2in, and also the heaviest, was the main freestyle anchor. If anyone was able to retain bodyfat, it was Mark, who had a gut instead of a eight pack set of abs like the other two. Mark had the biggest hands and feet of the four, and could out lift the other two besides Thomas. It was Mark who supplied nearly half of tonight&#39;s meal for Thomas. Thomas wrapped his arm around Mark and helped him stammer to the showers. <br />
<br />
Thomas asked, &quot;Can we stay at your grandparents place this weekend?&quot; as the two stood under the shower to wash off the chlorinated pool water.<br />
<br />
Mark rested his head on Thomas&#39;s chest, &quot;We are always welcome. I&#39;ll just need to have them turn on the pool heater.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas, pulled Mark tightly in with his one arm and kissed the top of his wet head, &quot;Come home with me tonight, I&#39;m asking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark sighed, &quot;Thomas...&quot; Mark didn&#39;t answer, breathing deeply. &quot;Alright, I never figured you for a Chubby chaser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas chuckled softly, &quot;Ummmm....look in the mirror Assman.&quot; Thomas was muscular, but his body was a mix of male proportions with the softness and muscle tone of a fit woman with a very firm and large set of buttocks that reinforced his female look. That was recent, thought Thomas, but yet had been there for a while since he was doing the butt exercises for the past year.<br />
<br />
Mark leaned into Thomas&#39;s arm, and kissed his bicep, &quot;Any chance for a truce tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas had worked Mark&#39;s production up from just a tiny amount of jizz to over a pint with a steady prostate fingering along with a healthy amount of oral attention on Mark&#39;s cock. The other two teammates had also been worked on by Thomas, but Mark&#39;s production was almost the same as the other two combined.<br />
<br />
The other two members of the relay team walked out with Mark, Thomas, and Thomas&#39;s parents into the parking lot. Mark opened the passenger door on his car for Thomas, and a few moments later was following Thomas&#39;s parents to their house.<br />
<br />
Thomas had to help a still weak Mark into the house and onto Thomas&#39;s bed, where he went quickly to sleep, halfway on the bed. Thomas went into the kitchen to the refrigerator and pulled out three heads of romaine and a couple of eggplants. Thomas&#39;s father came into the kitchen to finish the dishes from earlier. Thomas&#39;s dad oiled the romaine heads, and slowly worked the first one into Thomas&#39;s wide anus as he leaned forward over the table. The other two heads went in easily. The two eggplants were a tight fit, even soaking with oil, into his new (but this didn&#39;t feel right, as it had always been there) vagina, aching to be filled at this point. It was a few moments before the need to feed cleared from his mind.<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s dad asked, &quot;Don&#39;t you think you need to cut back...it seems to straight into your hips or ass these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas smiled, &quot;I swam over six miles tonight, and I&#39;ll spend the weekend at Mark&#39;s grandparents swimming to maintain the best state of conditioning that the coach wants us to keep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s dad looked at his son&#39;s toned, but very female body minus the chest, &quot;Okay, I worry about you and the coaches. You and Mark stand out at the swim meets now. Your coach has asked what you eat, and I told him.&quot; Thomas&#39;s dad paused, looking at the produce on the counter, and asked, &quot;Ready for a third eggplant?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas shook his head as he stood up, &quot;Not tonight. You know you don&#39;t have to feed me anymore like that. I can do it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s dad hugged Thomas tightly and held the embrace for a while. Thomas&#39;s dad closed his eyes to fight the tears. After a few moments, he relaxed, &quot;I am running out of opportunities son, you will be heading off to college in a few months, and it will be here before you know it.&quot; Thomas&#39;s dad kissed his son&#39;s cheek before patting him on the back and sending him to his room. Both of Thomas&#39;s parents were coming to terms with his moving out for college. The four had all been accepted to the University of Pennsylvania with full scholarships. The four of them would take the men&#39;s swimming program from the bottom of the Ivy League and become contenders for the conference title, or at least that was the expectation.<br />
<br />
Thomas laid down on the bed behind Mark, and pulled his body to him like a giant teddy bear. Thomas was so tired, he forgot to turn off the light, and feel into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
Mark was not in the bed when Thomas turned off his alarm. Thomas staggered to the bathroom and sat on the toilet to pee. Thomas noticed his legs were flesh toned. Thomas wiped, flushed, and stared at the mirror behind the sink as he washed his hands and sighed. Thomas went to bed more or less a cuntboy...but was a flat chested woman now with tiny male nipples. This was new to Thomas, but yet, not, as this was the result of his reaching puberty at thirteen. The shiny material of his symbiote was now a pair of shorts that split his butt cheeks apart with a high waist. Mark came into the bathroom naked, and took Thomas&#39;s hand and led them into the shower, where Mark turned on the water and Thomas knelt down on his knees to begin his first milking session of Mark&#39;s cock and prostate massage. Thomas focused on his meal, noticing Mark&#39;s cock was thicker and his testicles had grown to stretch taught Mark&#39;s hairless scrotum to a size now slightly larger than a baseball.<br />
<br />
Mark admired Thomas&#39;s mostly PAWG form. He had regretted not taking Thomas for his girlfriend earlier, but had made the most of the last two years with Thomas. She was an incredible swimmer, and an incredible cocksucker, and someday, his wife. Mark loved talking about kids with Thomas, which usually ended with Thomas&#39;s mouth devouring his cock deep into her throat. The other two guys on the relay team were fuck buddies as well, and over time, had become a really strong, tightknit foursome with Mark as the alpha, and since Thomas had three holes to fill....four was a good number.</p>
