<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake admits: &quot;I&#39;m not sure if we should go further down this road of having you used by me or if we should take a turn into transforming me and you use me.&quot; Alice considers this for a moment. &quot;I think it&#39;s only fair that we both get to experience being the object. I would love to see you as a sex toy and use you for my pleasure.&quot; She grins. &quot;But I also understand if you&#39;re not comfortable with that. It&#39;s a big step and we should take it slowly.&quot; &quot;Hey, why should only you have the fun part?&quot; Jake smirkes. &quot;But to be honest, I think it would be good if we take turns because I&#39;m not sure how often I could fuck you in a row without breaks. So I hope that if you transform me in between that would help for this.&quot; He wonders what kind of object Alice would transform him into. &quot;Oh, and I have no idea if I want to keep my human mind or have it changed to fit the object you would want me to be.&quot; Alice nods. &quot;That makes sense. And I&#39;m sure we can find something that we both enjoy. As for your mind, I think it would be interesting to see what it&#39;s like for you to have your personality changed. But ultimately, the decision is yours. I just want you to have a good time.&quot; She leans in and gives him a kiss. &quot;So, what do you want to be transformed into, my love?&quot; &quot;Why not do some experiments like we did with you? This way I can find out what I want to happen to my personality as an object. Now, I want you to tell me an idea of what kind of object I shall become. You know, just like I had the idea of transforming you into a simple cylinder for testing purposes. What do you want me to become? Also such a simple object? Or something more complex? Or even sophisticated?&quot;<br />
Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;How about we start with something simple, like a vibrator? That way you can still have some control over your movements and we can see how you like it. And then we can move on to something more complex or sophisticated if you want.&quot; She gives him a reassuring smile. &quot;But ultimately, the decision is yours. I just want you to have a good time.&quot; &quot;Ah, that&#39;s sweet. But is a vibrator the sex toy of your choice? I mean, you told me once that you have never bought one because it would not give you the clitoral pleasure you need to orgasm.&quot; Jake hesitates for a short moment. &quot;Oh, as the cylinder you didn&#39;t even have a clitoris. How was this to cum without one?&quot; Alice laughs. &quot;Well, you&#39;re right about that. As a cylinder, I didn&#39;t have a clitoris, but I still felt pleasure all over my body. It was a different kind of orgasm, it was just amazing.&quot; She leans in and gives him a kiss. &quot;But you&#39;re right. As a vibrator you won&#39;t stimulate my clit if I push you inside. And I wouldn&#39;t feel you in me when I use you on my clit. Maybe some other form would be more beneficial...&quot; &quot;You know, I don&#39;t just like to fuck you. I also like to lick your clit. Can&#39;t we combine these two in some kind of innovative sex toy? I&#39;d be your very own unique little toy, made exclusively for your pleasure.&quot; Alice looks at him, surprised. &quot;That&#39;s an interesting idea, Jake. But I&#39;m not sure how we would go about creating such a toy. It would have to be able to move and stimulate my clit while also being able to penetrate me. And I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s even possible.&quot;<br />
&quot;OK, that won&#39;t be a simple object anymore. Point taken.&quot; Jake replies. &quot;So that won&#39;t let me experiment with the settings for my personality solely. I think I go for a simple beach ball for getting an idea if I want to stay myself or not as an object. Would that be OK for you if we postpone myself being your sex toy?&quot; &quot;That sounds like a good idea, Jake. I think it&#39;s important that you have a chance to experiment with the settings for your personality and see what you&#39;re comfortable with. And I&#39;m sure we can find another time for you to be my sex toy.&quot; She smiles. &quot;Besides, I was always having good times being the little green cylinder even before you fucked me.&quot; Her smile changes to a grin. &quot;I mean before you fucked it.&quot; Jake laughs. &quot;Yes, you were a very good little cylinder. I loved fucking you, I mean it.&quot; He grins back. &quot;So, let&#39;s set everything up and start the transformation. I&#39;m ready to become a beach ball!&quot;<br />
Alice opens the software to adjust the settings for Jake&#39;s transformation. She makes sure to set the sensitivity to a high level, so that he can feel every touch. &quot;OK, everything is set up. Are you ready, my love?&quot; She looks at Jake with a mix of excitement and love in her eyes. &quot;Is it possible that I transform into an initially deflated beach ball? I mean, if I&#39;m going to be a pool toy then I want to experience it fully.&quot; He smiles sheepishly. &quot;You just have to blow me up me after the transformation and then deflate me before you make me human again. At least I think that would be important then.&quot; Alice laughs. &quot;Of course, my love. I can set the transformation to make you a deflated beach ball. And I promise to blow you up and deflate you as needed.&quot; She adjusts the settings accordingly. &quot;But I&#39;m making you a smaller version. I don&#39;t want to run out of breath if I have to fill you up every time. I guess something like basketball size is OK? And I&#39;ll just use transparent as the color. I find it kind of exciting that I can then see through you.&quot; Jake agrees. &quot;That sounds great, my love. I&#39;m ready to be your little transparent beach ball.&quot; He lies down on the bed and takes a deep breath. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to feel your hands on me, blowing me up and playing with me.&quot;<br />
Alice clicks and starts the transformation process. After the initial scanning, Jake moans softly as the beam touches his skin, feeling how it changes into smooth, transparent plastic. He can feel his body becoming smaller and more compact as it takes on the shape of a deflated beach ball. He can feel the tightness of the plastic as it conforms to his new shape, and he can feel the being a deflated pool toy. Finally, the transformation is complete, and Jake lies on the bed as an empty, small, transparent beach ball.<br />
Alice looks at the beach ball with a mixture of excitement and concern. &quot;Jake? Can you hear me?&quot; she asks. *Yes, I can hear you,* Jake replies through the mental link. *I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m a beach ball now.* He sounds slightly disoriented, but also excited. Alice smiles. &quot;I&#39;m going to blow you up now, my love. Are you ready?&quot; *Yes,* Jake replies. *I&#39;m ready. Just be careful not to overfill me. I have no idea if I could stand this.* Alice hears him laughing nervously. She nods and starts to touch the small plastic thing lying on the bed in front of her. Through the mental link she hears Jake&#39;s pleasurable noises as she touches his plastic body. *Oh, that feels so good,* Jake moans. *I can feel your hands on me. It&#39;s like a soft caress on my skin.* Alice smiles. &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it, my love. I&#39;m going to start blowing you up now.&quot; She leans over and starts to blow air into the valve on the beach ball. As she blows, she can feel Jake&#39;s pleasure increase through the mental link. He&#39;s moaning softly and his body is vibrating with pleasure. *Oh, yes, that feels so good,* Jake moans. *I can feel my body expanding and becoming full of air. It&#39;s like I&#39;m being inflated with pleasure.* Alice continues to blow air into the beach ball, and soon it starts to take on a more rounded shape. She can feel Jake&#39;s body expanding, and she can hear his moans getting louder and more intense. *Oh, yes, keep blowing, my love. I&#39;m almost full now. I can feel my body getting bigger and bigger, and it feels amazing,* Jake moans. &quot;Yes, I think I know what you feel. As the cylinder, I also felt every touch from you and it is like being flooded by a wave of pleasure.&quot; She begins to roll him around on the bed, her hands caressing his body, her fingers wander along his seams. &quot;It&#39;s so much fun to play with you like this.&quot; *Yes, please keep playing with me,* Jake replies. *It feels so good.* Alice grins and keeps on rolling him around, her hands exploring every inch of his transparent plastic body. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to try something new now.&quot; She brings her hands to his seams and starts to rub them gently. &quot;How does this feel?&quot; *Oh, yes, that feels amazing,* Jake moans. *I never thought that my seams could feel so good.* Alice smiles and continues to rub his seams, her hands moving faster and faster. &quot;And now I&#39;m trying something else in addition.&quot; She brings her lips to the valve on the beach ball and starts to lick it gently. *Oh, hmmm, yes, that&#39;s, ooh... Don&#39;t stop this!* Jake moans. *That feels so good!* Alice continues to rub his seams while licking the valve. &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it, my little toy.&quot; She keeps on licking and rubbing until Jake reaches his climax. *Yes, I&#39;m coming! Oh, yes!* Jake moans as he orgasms. Alice smiles and continues her actions until Jake&#39;s climax subsides. &quot;Did you like that, my love?&quot; *Yes, it was incredible,* Jake replies while Alice prepares his retransformation. &quot;OK, wait a minute, I&#39;ll deflate you before I transform you back.&quot; She releases the valve and the beach ball deflates. *Oh, that&#39;s different! Not unpleasant. But I have the feeling that I&#39;m somehow running out of energy.* Alice nods and smiles. &quot;Yes, that sounds reasonable. You loose the pressure that kept you in your shape.&quot; She presses the last of the air out of him until he&#39;s only a wobbly piece of see-through soft plastic. *Hnng... Feels like a rough massage.*<br />
Alice goes to the laptop and starts the retransformation process. One minute later, Jake sits on the bed, his body back to normal. &quot;Wow, that was an interesting experience,&quot; he says, still catching his breath. &quot;I have to admit, I really enjoyed being a beach ball. And I&#39;m glad you had fun too.&quot;<br />
Alice nods and smiles. &quot;Yes, I had a lot of fun. And I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it too. But tell me, what was it like for you not to have your personality changed?&quot; She looks at him curiously. &quot;It was strange. I was fully aware of what was going on, but I couldn&#39;t do anything. It was just experiencing, no acting. I think the weirdest thing was that I didn&#39;t feel any transition in my mind. I mean, there was nothing in my consciousness that signaled to me that I was now a beach ball. I felt kind of like I always did. You know what I mean? Was it similar for you when you were the cylinder for the first time and we hadn&#39;t adjusted your mind to be that of such a cylinder?&quot; Alice looks thoughtfully. &quot;Yes, it was similar for me. I felt like myself, just in a different body. And I was still aware of what was going on around me. It was just like being in a different skin, so to speak.&quot; She leans over and gives him a kiss. &quot;I&#39;m glad you had a good time, my love. And I&#39;m excited to see what you want to try next.&quot; Jake returns the kiss and feels his penis harden. &quot;Oh, there&#39;s one thing that was really different for me. Having an orgasm without ejaculating. I think that&#39;s some kind of a new experience for a man like me.&quot; He laughs. &quot;For you as a woman, did your first orgasm as the cylinder feel dramatically different?&quot; &quot;Yes, it did. It was more intense, and it seemed to last longer. And the sensation was spread out over my whole body instead of being focused on my clitoris. It was almost like a full-body orgasm.&quot; She smiles. &quot;But I&#39;m curious, what kind of orgasm did you have as a beach ball? Was it similar to a full-body orgasm too?&quot; Jake rethinks his last words. &quot;Hmmm... When you say it like this... Yes, it was more all over me. Yeah, I would call this a full-body orgasm. And it was lasting extremely long. I mean, as a human man I cum and a few moments later I&#39;m in the afterglow. Most of the times your orgasms lasted always longer than mine when we had sex. So, this is a great new experience for me.&quot; &quot;I understand what you mean and I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. And I have to admit, it was really hot to feel you come like that.&quot; She leans in and gives him another kiss. &quot;So, what do you want to try next, my love?&quot;<br />
He lays back onto the mattress. &quot;Of course the same step you took next. I want to be that beach ball again just like I was before. With one exception: Transform my mind also. Make me a beach ball completely. Just like you were the soft green spandex cylinder with a spandex cylinder&#39;s mind.&quot; Alice is excited. &quot;That sounds great, my love. I&#39;m excited to see how you like being a beach ball with a beach ball&#39;s mind.&quot; She opens the software and adjusts the settings. She makes sure to set the personality to that of a beach ball, and she sets the sensitivity to a high level. &quot;OK, everything is set up. Are you ready, my love?&quot; She looks at Jake with a mixture of excitement and love in her eyes. &quot;Oh, more than ready. I&#39;m really excited!&quot; Jake says.<br />
Alice clicks on the laptop and starts the transformation process. As the beam scans Jake&#39;s body, she notices his erect penis. &quot;Looks like someone is excited,&quot; she giggles. But before Jake can respond, the transformation has already reached his neck and head. He can no longer speak, and his mind begins to change, becoming more simple and focused on pleasure. His body becomes smaller and more compact, taking on the shape of a deflated beach ball. Alice watches in amazement as Jake&#39;s body transforms, his skin becoming smooth and transparent plastic. She can see his erect penis slowly deflating as it becomes part of the beach ball. Finally, the transformation is complete, and Jake lies on the bed as an empty, small, transparent beach ball. Inside, his mind is that of a simple beach ball, focused only on pleasure and play.<br />
Alice looks at the beach ball with a mixture of excitement and concern. &quot;Jake? Can you hear me?&quot; she asks. No answer. She waits a moment and tries again. &quot;Jake? Are you there?&quot; Still no response. Alice realizes that Jake&#39;s personality is now that of a beach ball and that there is no Jake until she transforms this beach ball back into Jake. When she was the cylinder with the cylinder&#39;s mind she also didn&#39;t think of herself as Alice anymore. &quot;Hello, my little beach ball. How are you feeling?&quot; Alice asks. She waits for a response, hoping that the beach ball can still communicate with her through the mental link. *I feel empty. Please inflate me so I can be a full-blown beach ball and you can have fun with me.* The beach ball replies. Alice smiles and picks up the little pool toy. She holds it against the light and looks fascinated through its soft plastic body. Alice hears the beach ball in her head: *Your touch feels great! I love being held by you.* She sits down on the bed and starts to blow air into its valve. As she blows, she can feel the beach ball&#39;s pleasure increase through the mental link. *Oh, yes, that feels so good! I can feel myself expanding and becoming full of air.* Alice senses pleasure in its voice and continues to blow air into the beach ball, and soon it&#39;s almost full. She can hear its moans getting louder and more intense. *Oh, yes, keep blowing. I&#39;m almost full now. I can feel myself getting bigger and bigger, and it feels amazing.* Alice blows even more air into the beach ball. She wants to know how it&#39;ll react if she would blow a bit too much air in it. She doesn&#39;t want to pop it. Just a bit more pressure than usual for such a pool toy. At the same time she plays with the tip of her tongue with the ball&#39;s valve. *Oh, yes, that&#39;s it. Keep going!* The beach ball moans. *I can feel myself stretching, but it&#39;s so good. I love being full of air and your hands on me.* Alice smiles and continues to blow and lick the valve. She can feel the beach ball&#39;s body expanding, and she can hear its moans getting even louder. *Yes, yes, that&#39;s it. Don&#39;t stop!* The beach ball cries out. Alice decides to blow a bit more air in, just to see how the beach ball would react. She can feel the plastic stretching more and more. *Oh, yes, that&#39;s so much air! I&#39;m so full, but it&#39;s wonderful.* The beach ball moans. *I can feel myself stretching, but it&#39;s so good. I love being so full of air!* Alice can feel the beach ball&#39;s body stretching to its limits. She decides to stop blowing air in, but instead, she starts to rub the beach ball&#39;s seams with her fingers. *Oh, yes, that feels amazing!* The beach ball moans. *I love how you touch my seams. You seem to know how to care for your toys.* Alice smiles and continues to rub the beach ball&#39;s seams, her fingers moving faster and faster. She can feel the plastic stretching to its limits. *Oh, yes, that&#39;s it! Keep rubbing me like that!* The beach ball cries out in pleasure. Alice decides to stimulate the ball more intensely. She brings her lips to the beach ball&#39;s valve and starts again to lick it gently. *Oh, hmmm, yes, that&#39;s, ooh... Don&#39;t stop this!* The beach ball moans. *That feels so good!* Alice smiles and continues to lick the valve and rub the seams. She can feel the beach ball&#39;s body stretching to its limits. She decides to push it a bit further. She presses the beach ball against herself while keeping on with rubbing and licking. *Oh, yes, that&#39;s it! I&#39;m so full, but it&#39;s wonderful!* The beach ball cries out. Alice can feel the plastic stretching to its limits. She presses the beach ball even harder against herself. *Oh, yes, that&#39;s so much pressure! I&#39;m so full, and it&#39;s so good!* The beach ball moans. It&#39;s clear that it will reach it&#39;s climax any second now. *Yes, yes, I&#39;m coming! Oh, yes!* The beach ball cries out in pleasure. Alice continues her actions until the beach ball reaches its climax. *Ooh, that&#39;s it! I&#39;m coming! Yes, yes! Ahhh!* It cries out in ecstasy. Alice smiles and continues her actions until the beach ball&#39;s climax subsides.<br />
&quot;Did you like that, my little toy?&quot; *Yes, it was incredible,* the beach ball replies. *I loved every second of it. Thank you for playing with me so well.* Alice smiles. &quot;Do you also like other kinds of play, my little beach ball?&quot; *Yes, I would love to be used in other ways too. Maybe you could bounce me around? Or maybe you could have fun with me in the water?* The beach ball suggests. &quot;Those sound like fun ideas, my little toy. I&#39;ll have to try them out with you.&quot; Alice says. &quot;But for now, I think I&#39;ll deflate you and transform you back.&quot; *Why deflate me? You want to transform me back into an empty piece of plastic? Why?* Alice pauses, surprised by the beach ball&#39;s question. &quot;I thought you would want to be transformed back into Jake. I&#39;m sorry if I misunderstood.&quot; She looks at the beach ball thoughtfully. &quot;Would you prefer to stay as a beach ball?&quot; *I don&#39;t need a name. Not when I&#39;m inflated and not when I&#39;m deflated. You don&#39;t need to call me Jake. And yes, why would I want to be anything else than a full-blown beach ball?* Alice realizes that she made the same mistake as Jake did when she was the cylinder. &quot;You&#39;re right. I apologize for assuming that you would want to be transformed. I understand now that you are a beach ball and that&#39;s all you want to be. I&#39;m sorry if I misunderstood your needs and desires.&quot; She looks at the beach ball with a mixture of respect and affection. &quot;Is there anything else you would like to share with me about being a beach ball?&quot; *I love being a beach ball. I love being played with, being blown up, and being used for pleasure. I don&#39;t need to be anything else. I&#39;m happy being a beach ball.*<br />
Alice places the ball on the bed. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy being a beach ball. And I&#39;m happy to play with you and bring you pleasure.&quot; She leans over and gives the beach ball a gentle kiss. &quot;But I think it&#39;s time for me to deflate you now. I don&#39;t want you to run out of air. Would that be OK with you?&quot; She looks at the beach ball with a mixture of excitement and concern. *Yes, that&#39;s fine. I understand that I need to be deflated.* The beach ball replies. *But please promise that we can play again soon.* &quot;Of course, I promise.&quot; Alice smiles. She pulls the valve open and starts to deflate the beach ball. As the air escapes, she can feel the beach ball&#39;s body becoming soft and limp. *Thank you for playing with me. I had a lot of fun.* The beach ball says as the last of the air escapes. Alice places the deflated beach ball on the bed and opens the software on the laptop. She adjusts the settings to transform the beach ball back into Jake and starts the process. Just a few moments later, Jake lays on the bed.<br />
&quot;Wow, that was an interesting experience,&quot; he says, still catching his breath. &quot;I have to admit, I really enjoyed being a beach ball. And I&#39;m glad you took my fears as the beach ball seriously. I really was this beach ball! I was really worried that you wouldn&#39;t want to play with me anymore! Can you believe that?&quot; Alice smiles and leans over to give Jake a kiss. &quot;I&#39;m really glad you enjoyed being a beach ball. And I promise you that I will always want to play with you, my love.&quot; She sits back and looks at him. &quot;So, what do you say? Is it better to be an object with your human mind or with the mind of that object?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s a good question! Being that object completely with its mind is a really intensive experience. But I think it&#39;s good that this is just an option and we may transform into inanimate objects with out own mind intact. There might be some transformations we&#39;d like more this way.&quot; He reaches out to hug her. &quot;What do you say? Do you personally prefer having your mind changed to have it match with the object you&#39;re transforming into?&quot; Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;I think it depends on the object and the situation. For example, when I was the cylinder, I enjoyed having my mind changed to match the object. And at this moment I can&#39;t think of an object I would want to transform into with my own mind.&quot; She smiles. &quot;But I agree with you, it&#39;s good to have the option to keep our minds intact. It allows for more exploration.&quot; She leans in and kisses him. He kisses her back. &quot;For you, was the orgasm with having the cylinder&#39;s consciousness also somehow more intense?&quot; &quot;Yes, it was more intense.&quot; She grins. &quot;I think the main difference is that with the cylinder&#39;s mind, I was more focused on pleasure. And I didn&#39;t have any thoughts about anything else. It was just pure pleasure.&quot; She leans in and gives him another kiss.<br />
He holds her in his arms and they kiss passionately. They begin to fondle and caress each other. Then he asks her. &quot;Do you want to continue like this or would you want to use our Transform-O-Matic and see if we find a form that fits our mood even more?&quot; Alice looks at him with a glint in her eyes. &quot;I think we should use our Transform-O-Matic and see what we can find. I&#39;m curious to see what kind of object would fit our mood.&quot; She smiles and leans in to give him a kiss. &quot;What do you think would fit our mood right now?&quot;</p>
