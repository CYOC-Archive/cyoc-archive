<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As fun as messing around with transformations was it was nice to have some amount of normalcy as Megan and Suzan got to school as humans. Well technically Suzan was always a dragon and was just a shapeshifted dragon, but she was human passing enough. That said after what happened yesterday there were murmurs about there being a dragon in school. On the bright side as it was the first day of school, and Megan and Suzan stuck to themselves yesterday no one really had any names yet. The dragon&#39;s human form was described generally, but that gave some room for denial as it fit a number of the freshman girls. Some of the whispers were afraid, some were curious, and others just really wanted to see a real life dragon. <br />
All this really accomplished though was a feeling of othering from humans in Suzan. Her desire to keep Megan alone as her dear friend as close as she could, but there was also fear that doing so would make Megan want to leave. The two friends ate together in the corner of the courtyard, but a certain slithery person ended up finding them. <br />
&quot;How do you do my little dragon?&quot; Kris the Lamia asked <br />
Suzan asked &quot;Was it that obvious?&quot;<br />
&quot;You had a thing for my scales, you kinda match the description of the rumors, and I was at the gym to practice swimming and I kinda heard what was going on.&quot; Kris took out his food and asked &quot;So... what&#39;s with this still human looking thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was born a dragon... I just didn&#39;t realize I was a dragon, lost control of the magic making me look like a human, and well here I am still looking like a human thanks to getting a better understanding of the magic.&quot;<br />
&quot;Figured I&#39;d be looking for a dragon and seeing If I could help comfort since it took me awhile to get used to not having legs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh I had a moment like that. I didn&#39;t know I was a dragon so... When I was in that form I was scared and panicking, but not right now...&quot; <br />
&quot;Ok, well I was going to offer my number in case you wanted to talk more or so I could give some numbers to some monster support lines... but if you want some space I understand.&quot; <br />
&quot;Thanks for the thought, but yeah right now I just want to think things through and just be with my friend here.&quot; Kris nodded and then slithered away. <br />
Megan said &quot;He seems nice.&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, but my life is too complicated right now... I&#39;d like to keep what&#39;s still simple stay simple. Mommy&#39;s saying Mother is coming to see me.&quot; <br />
&quot;So Shawna&#39;s saying your birth mother is coming?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep, and I&#39;m not even sure how to feel about it. Apparently my birth parents have been keeping me well taken care of, but I don&#39;t really know much about them other than they are dragons and are pretty rich.&quot; It was a little awkward, but the two enjoyed each other&#39;s company for a bit till the bell rang. <br />
<br />
The final period eventually came, and all the students were very wary of the girl they saw become a dragon. Then as they went out to the court coach told everyone to take a few laps as he took Suzan out. Coach said &quot;So after what happened yesterday we decided that for you to get the most out of physical education. We should probably be training a dragon a little differently than a human. Does that make sense?&quot; <br />
Suzan said &quot;I guess so...&quot;<br />
&quot;Just so I&#39;m not missing anything can you go in and out of that dragon form easily?&quot;<br />
&quot;I just learned how to do that yes.&quot; <br />
&quot;Alright then... now where... ah...&quot; The coach whistled towards the top of the building where someone seemed to be near the top of... Then they jumped and... oh god they had wings!<br />
An older harpy floated down and said &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Stacy. Won a few awards at some gymnastic tournaments and now I&#39;m working with monster youth to properly train their bodies. I work mostly with winged monsters.&quot; she held out one of her claws hands. <br />
Suzan grabbed on and shook it and said &quot;I&#39;m Suzan, and I&#39;m a dragon....&quot; <br />
&quot;Like a European dragon, Chinese dragon, maybe a flying snake like kukulkan?&quot;<br />
&quot;More European, like blue dragon with wings.&quot; With the football field clear Suzan was able to get in her dragon form. Said dragon form was very clumsy. for the first session Stacy decided to start Suzan off with just walking and making sure she could realistically move slowly in her dragon form. Very least Stacy and her flight let her more easily see Suzan&#39;s form and talk to her close to Suzan&#39;s head. In one aspect it was easier than the standard workout, on the other hand it was basically Suzan to learning to walk again. Suzan was feeling a little scared about when Stacy would ask her to start flying. <br />
<br />
The school day finished Megan and human form Suzan were waiting for their ride home. They figured after today Suzan&#39;s name would be leaked and that would be that for Suzan&#39;s human anonymity. Both friends spotted Shawna&#39;s car, but there was someone in the passenger&#39;s seat... Then Shawna was pointing- The passenger door flew open and a tall lady with platinum blonde hair who couldn&#39;t have been older than 25 came out and ran to Suzan. &quot;Ah, you&#39;re little Suzy aren&#39;t you?&quot; She gave Suzan a hug and said &quot;Oh, how I&#39;ve wished I could do that since I was a little girl. Let&#39;s go let&#39;s go we&#39;ve got a lot of catching up to do!&quot; <br />
Shawna from in the car said &quot;Denora! Save the cuddling for when we get back home, you&#39;ll just embarrass and confuse Suzan.&quot;<br />
Denora smiled and said &quot;Of course. Come on then Suzy, your friend can come along if she wants. We&#39;ll be going to the best sushi restaurant in the city.&quot; The woman held herself with confidence and Suzan knew that the woman was really a dragon, and probably her mother. While she was walking she noticed a tugging sensation. Suzan saw she was holding Megan&#39;s hand, and her friend was a little hesitant about going. <br />
&quot;Do you want to come with? Things are a little weird, and I understand if you don&#39;t want to go.&quot; Suzan said. <br />
Megan thought and then said...</p>
