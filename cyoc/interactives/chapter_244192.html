<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning sun peeked through the blinds, illuminating Ashley&#39;s bedroom as she stirred from her slumber.  A peculiar sensation tickled her consciousness, and she looked down to see a delightful surprise. &quot;yes it&#39;s still here&quot;  she thought, grinning broadly at the sight of her human penis standing tall above her pussy. The feeling of power and exhilaration surged through her as she realized she had retained parts of her male form. &quot;Oh boy,&quot; she murmured to herself, the thrill of the transformation still potent in her veins.<br />
<br />
Her gaze traveled to her feet, which were surprisingly larger than she remembered. They were like the hands at the end of her legs, yet they felt right. The soft pads of her new feet-hands touched the cold wooden floor, sending a shiver up her spine as she marveled at the sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s give this a shot,&quot; she said out loud, her voice filled with excitement and trepidation as she attempted to stand. The process was clumsy, akin to a toddler taking their first steps, but she balanced herself with surprising grace. She took a few wobbly steps before the sensation grew more natural.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I&#39;m getting the hang of this,&quot; she exclaimed, her thoughts racing with the joy of her newfound capabilities.<br />
<br />
Her journey to the bathroom was fraught with small challenges, but she faced each one with the determination of a seasoned explorer. When she finally reached the toilet, she couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the sight of her overshooting the target, leaving a few yellow droplets scattered about. &quot;Well, that&#39;s one way to make a statement,&quot; she mused.<br />
<br />
After she finished her business with the toilet, she shuffled to the shower, feeling a strange sense of familiarity with her new routine. The water hit her body like a symphony, cascading over her hair, each droplet a note of sensation. She raised the shower head with a grunt, the effort of her now male body surprising her.<br />
<br />
As the water washed over her, she felt a stirring in her loins, and her penis grew hard. &quot;Who knew this could feel so good?&quot; she thought, her mind swirling with the alien yet tantalizing sensations. She touched herself tentatively, her hand moving with the confidence of a man.<br />
<br />
The orgasm that followed was intense, leaving her panting and leaning against the wall. Her mind reeled with the power of it, and she felt a strange sense of pride at her ability to navigate such a primal act.<br />
<br />
As she regained composure, she reached up and hit the mental switch in her mind, transforming into Fangor, the were-gorilla. He chuckled, his deep, gruff laugh echoing through the bathroom before deciding that perhaps, for Jason&#39;s sake, his human form was more suitable for the moment.<br />
<br />
With a silent grunt, he shifted back to Ashley, feeling the fur recede and his limbs shrink. The cold tile floor greeted his bare hands, and he stepped out of the shower, the water droplets glittering like diamonds in the light.<br />
<br />
Drying off, he pondered his new reality. &quot;What am I going to wear?&quot; he murmured, looking at the clothes laid out for him.  The pants and underwear were a no-go, far too tight for his now-enlarged member. &quot;I guess skirts it is,&quot; he thought with a shrug, feeling a strange sense of liberation.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, the act of cooking had transformed into a dance of power and precision. The eggs cracked with a satisfying snap between his robust fingers, though a few pieces did escape his grasp, painting the counter with a mess of yolk and shell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, breakfast!&quot; he called out, his voice a mix of his mother&#39;s and something deeper, more primal.<br />
<br />
Jason stumbled in, rubbing sleep from his eyes. He blinked in surprise at the sight of his mother&#39;s manly hands at the end of her legs, the bulge under her skirt unmistakable. &quot;Mom?&quot; he asked, his voice tentative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, buddy,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s still me.&quot;<br />
<br />
They sat at the table, a mess of eggs, toast, and juice before them. &quot;So, how does it feel?&quot; he ventured, curiosity in his eyes as he stared at her feet and hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... different,&quot; she replied, a blush spreading across her cheeks. &quot;But I&#39;m getting used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The conversation was awkward at first, but they soon found a rhythm, their shared astonishment turning into a newfound bond. &quot;Why do you have to wear skirts?&quot; he asked, pointing to the bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she began, her face flushing even deeper, &quot;none of my other clothes fit quite right with... you know, this.&quot; she got an erection that unfortunately showed her son her new cock. <br />
<br />
Both blushed furiously, and she hastily apologized for being so forward. &quot;It&#39;s just that... It&#39;s all new to me,&quot; she admitted, her voice shaky.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Mom,&quot; Jason said, his voice gentle. &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about that gorilla guy? Can you still turn into him?&quot; he asked, his curiosity piqued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean Fangor?&quot; she said, her eyes lighting up. &quot;Sure, I can show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a twirl of power, she transformed before his eyes, her clothing ripping off as he showed his muscles off. Fangor stood before him, naked and unabashed. &quot;Whoa!&quot; Jason exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still me, just... hairier,&quot; he chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to put on a show for me, Fangor,&quot; Jason said, his cheeks red. &quot;I know you&#39;re still my mom, but can you put some clothes on? It&#39;s weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sheepish grin, Fangor shifted back into Ashley, and she put on the only clothing nearby, an apron Jason&#39;s dad used to wear.<br />
<br />
The day unfolded into a whirlwind of laughter and discovery as they played around the house. Ashley climbed walls with ease, her feet-hands finding purchase where they never could before. She swung from the curtains, her muscular arms flexing with the joy of her newfound strength.<br />
<br />
They talked about everything, from his school to her transformation, and even the occasional mishap with her new anatomy. It was a strange, wonderful day filled with more love and understanding than either of them had ever thought possible.<br />
<br />
And as the sun set, they lay in bed, Jason&#39;s hand on her furry arm, his voice filled with sleepy awe. &quot;You&#39;re like a superhero,&quot; he murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I am,&quot; Ashley said, a warm smile on her lips. &quot;And you, you&#39;re the bravest kid I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
The future remained a mystery, but with Jason by her side, she felt ready to face whatever came her way, whether as a woman with a penis or as the mighty Fangor. The bond between mother and son had grown stronger, transcending the boundaries of flesh and blood to become more profound.</p>
