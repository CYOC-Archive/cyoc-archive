<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">English, whilst engaging, did not cleanse Tyler’s mind of that boy he saw in Chemistry. His impressively large frame, his towering physique,<br />
<br />
his one painted nail.<br />
<br />
 Tyler’s mind was racing again.<br />
“He can’t be gay. Not someone who looked like him. Although I don’t actually know what he looks like. Maybe I’ll say hi next lesson. Oh God, what if he says hi back? What if he doesn’t?”<br />
<br />
“Psst, Tyler, what’s the answer to Question 2?”<br />
<br />
He snapped back into reality. Oliver was leaning towards him, staring intently at his workbook.<br />
<br />
“Nevermind. Got it.”<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was boring. Maths was pretty inconsequential. Tyler rememberers hearing Sam joke that he could literally feel his cells dying. The boys had P.E as the last lesson, and so watching Oliver strip proudly into tight gym shorts and shirt was a bit too much for Tyler to handle. He caught himself blatantly staring at Oliver’s body. Even though Oliver didn’t notice, he was still flexing cockily. His biceps bulged out of his arms. As he puffed his chest out, you could see his pecs push through his shirt. He almost ripped his shirt off just by flexing. That’s probably what he was going for. Tyler was impressed, and definitely turned on, but Oliver was nothing compared to the boy in Chemistry. <br />
<br />
“Stop it Oliver. We get it, you have muscles.”<br />
<br />
Sam’s jokes often brought Tyler out of the perpetually state of lust.<br />
<br />
“Someone’s jealous they don’t have these.”<br />
<br />
Oliver struck a double bicep pose.<br />
<br />
“I’m jealous alright. I wish I could do that and still somehow convince myself I was straight.”<br />
<br />
That evening, after dinner, the boys were getting ready for bed. Tyler changed into matching striped pyjamas, whereas Sam and Oliver chose the classic shirt and pants option. Tyler tried to sleep, his mind racing about his first day. The room was filled with the sounds of snoring. Oliver was the loudest, but Sam had the longest breaths. That and the sweltering dorm caused Tyler to stand up from his bed and open the window. He leaned out, breathing the fresh, cold winter air, and looked down on the gardens.<br />
<br />
There, he saw him. The boy from before, standing in a corner by a patch of flowers, which were planted underneath a small streetlight. Tyler could make out his strapping body, as he knelt down and grabbed a bunch of flowers, and ate them all in one bite.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the boy stood up and roared. His deep baritone voice shook the buildings, as he flexed his arms and legs. Tyler watched as the boy grew before his very eyes. He could see his feet fill out his large shoes. His trousers rode up his bulging calves, and his thighs grew. His ass tore out of his clothes. The shirt the boy wore was already on the brink of tearing, but this sudden growth spurt caused it to just give up. It struggled to hang onto the boy’s growing arms and back. The shirt buttons popped off as his pecs swelled out another inch. The boy groaned as he could feel the hormones flood his body. He flexed his gigantic biceps, and began worshipping is new body. He grabbed his ass and gave it a tight squeeze. Tyler stood in both shock and lust.<br />
<br />
He turned around, and Tyler could finally see his face. An incredibly strong jawline was lightly coated in stubble. His short hair dangled enticingly above his bright, blue eyes. Tyler could see his laptop-sized pecs rest above his thick 8-pack, which all pushed eagerly through his tight uniform. Then Tyler looked down and almost lost his footing.<br />
<br />
A large bulge at the boy’s crotch protruded through his trousers. It began to lengthen, slithering it’s way down his right thigh. That thing must’ve been 12” at least! Tyler started getting hard just seeing him. The boy’s massive arm reached swiftly into his trousers, and pulled out his cock. It was leaking obscenely with precum. His balls were already the size of grapefruits. He began pulling on his cock, as he moaned with his low voice. Tyler could feel his moans vibrate the floor. The boy’s movements grew quicker and quicker, until he roared again, and a huge spurt of cum shot from his manhood. Again, and again, he came. Over 9 shots later, it finally stopped. Tyler found himself jizzing in his pyjamas, as he stood in awe of this teenage beast.<br />
<br />
Then, the boy looked up, right at Tyler. Their eyes met for a few seconds. He smiled. Out of sheer panic, Tyler closed the window, and hurried under the covers of his bed. His mind raced. He must be dreaming. This isn’t real. This has to be a dream!</p>
