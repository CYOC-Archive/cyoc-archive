<br />
	“Now’s the time,” a witch orates.<br />
<br />
	“Finally,” a warlock replies. “You don’t know how long I’ve been waiting to do this.”<br />
<br />
	The witch is a young woman named Katrina Jameson who just spoke to her fiancé Jim. The pair are loyal to each other as well as being equally attractive. Katrina is 5’4” while having wavy blonde hair complete with a shade of pink that is halfway up and a combination of a bun and a ponytail. She also has charming blue eyes with a fair amount of makeup. Jim has green eyes with dark blue hair that can almost be qualified as black all in a handsome crew cut and having a height of 6&#39;1&quot; to top it off. Their outfits have a badge that has a ‘T’ and ‘G’ close to each other. (The ‘T’ is pink while the ‘G’ is blue.) Since they both have a mix of male and female victims, the majority of their uniform is purple. Whereas the woman’s uniform is a lighter shade of purple with a blouse, skirt, dark purple leggings with blue and pink stripes, and a pair of heels, Jim’s outfit has an unbuttoned shirt with long sleeves while revealing his chest hair, large pectorals, and six pack stomach. To go with these, he has dark purple pants that go down to his dress shoes, which are both black.<br />
<br />
	As you would expect, they both enjoy making a good gender change. Consider these two partners in crime if you like. They first met when they were both in college taking gender studies during their first year in 2021. Jim and Katrina talked to each other outside of their classes and often helped each other out. At first, Katrina thought of Jim as just a close friend, but the more she spent time with him, the more her feelings for him developed to the point of ultimately confessing to Jim almost a year ago at the end of May. Naturally, he approved her confession, agreed to be her boyfriend, and gave her a kiss that neither of them would regret. After they heard about the genocide of transgender people, they were angry about the Florida government’s decisions and dropped out. Since then, they have secretly made their own organization about swapping the genders of both men and women and became the servants of transformation, so now, it is time for them to take things a bit farther.<br />
<br />
	“Well, big boy,” Katrina playfully comments as she opens the door for Jim. “What are you waiting for?”<br />
<br />
	“Let’s go and make the most out of this,” Jim answers before the both of them leave the hideout and start their quest.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
11:54am, at Maryroad Junior High School<br />
<br />
	My classmates are being loud as usual, and it’s almost time to leave. Their chatter floods the entire room as a long-haired brunette girl who has her hair in a ponytail sits and watches the clock slowly go by. That brunette right there is me, Amelia Wilson, who just so happens to be the main character. I’m inside a typical classroom with the teacher patiently waiting with me. I bet that she’s just as excited as I am. <br />
<br />
	Ring! Ring! Ring!<br />
<br />
	“Enjoy your summer break!” My ELA teacher, Mrs. Farmer, cheers excitedly. <br />
<br />
	In response, I get out of my seat, pack up my things, and leave the building. While I’m doing the latter, I might as well describe myself to you. I’m usually the type of girl to be nice and kind-hearted despite not being a talkative person. I’m going to be in the high school level as soon as I get back in school! My eyes are a beautiful form of hazel with pouty red lips as if I put lipstick on them. I have a light blue t-shirt and a hot pink skirt. My feet have black chacos on them as they show my cute and petite feet. After going downstairs to the first floor, I head outside, go toward my mom’s red car, and ride in it with my phone playing music.<br />
<br />
	Let me tell you a few things about my mom, Angela. She has short dark brown hair with some gray shades in it, and her eyes are green. Her face is marked up with wrinkles while she has a chubby figure. You could say that she looks like a grandma, but I think it would be a bit insulting if you said it to her face. Whenever she needs to read or look closely at stuff, she likes to have some glasses like the current scenario I’m in. She is wearing an orange blouse with some navy-blue jeans. There are some women’s shoes covering her feet. <br />
<br />
	She is a teacher at Blount Middle School and a teacher at Sunday School. That last part makes her sound like a typical Christian, and let me tell you, she is. At around 8:40 am, she usually leaves me with my dad, who is named Dana and far from the most athletic man around. He has many receding spots brought with age, a pair of glasses, and a big tummy that isn’t even covered with a shirt. On top of that, Dad doesn’t even take a shower or even brush his teeth. It sometimes makes me think, ‘how the hell did I get a dad like this?’ Once Mom’s car arrives at my house, which has basic brown walls, she parks inside the garage while Bella, the white canine, watches. After I open the white door, I step inside the house and prepare to relax.<br />
<br />
	Now that I’m here, I might as well describe the inside of the house. When I get inside from the garage, the first room I enter is the kitchen. On the kitchen ceiling, there is a white chandelier. Looking to the left, I see a kitchen stove and a microwave oven above it. As for the right side, there is a table with silverware, straws, and some other stuff in its drawers. Before I go on with the next room, there is a bar along with two wooden tall chairs.<br />
<br />
	With the living room, its inner walls are light green along with the kitchen. The gray couches along with the gray chair give visitors a walkway. One of the couches is vertical; the other, meanwhile, is horizontal. In between both of them is a dark brown end table. In front of the horizontal couch is a light cyan rug being held down by a trash can, a gray bunching table, and my dad, who is playing a video game with his friends. There is also a blocky corner with a fireplace inside, and there is a quote above the fireplace because of the wooden shelf. Going further, I see a wooden dining table with eight wooden chairs around it. Above them is another white chandelier, and all of the curtains in the entire room are white.<br />
<br />
	“What’s up, weasel?” my big sister, Katie, pops in. <br />
<br />
	Before I continue with the tour, let me tell you about her. Her hair is a nice shade of brunette, but unlike mine, Katie’s hair is down to her shoulders. She also has a pair of black glasses that are in front of her green eyes. She has a light purple blouse with long sleeves along with some black pants and some black tennis shoes. You could call her nerdier compared to me, but it would be more like an insult in reality. (Just trust me)<br />
<br />
	As for her personality, Katie usually likes to call me weasel because I can go crazy at times. Other than that, she is a very trustworthy sister who I can count on. Whenever I need help on a problem, she can give me some hints to solve it. She would even tell me to stay calm in terrible situations as if she was my mom. That reminds me, she graduated a week ago, and soon, she’ll be off to college!<br />
<br />
	Once I take off my shoes and socks, I walk into the short hallway leading to Katie’s old room, which is where Dad sleeps nowadays, Dad’s bathroom with blue wallpaper, and my room. As I go inside the latter, there is bright yellow wallpaper on the walls. While I walk on the carpet, I go to the closet, which is the opposite to outside of it: messy with shoes all over the floor. The shoes are flip flops, tennis shoes, and chacos. I drop the shoes to let them join in the messiness. I close the white closet doors and set my eyes all over the rest of the room. There is a big wide screen TV, like in the living room, but unlike my dad, I use it to play my blu-rays and DVDs, which are placed on the white shelf below the TV. The blu-rays and DVDs are mostly anime related, but there’s a fair number of movies too. There is also a portable player for both my blu-rays and DVDs. The center of the room has a gray chair for me to read whenever I’m not in my mom’s closet, which I usually borrow to do that. Speaking of reading, there are some books on another white shelf near the closet, but there are not nearly as many of them as the blu-rays and DVDs. I turn to the left to notice a brown bed with a heavy marble gray blanket and a marble mattress. After leaving my room, I get on the couch and relax with the light purple blanket.<br />
<br />

<br />
7:57 pm<br />
<br />
	“Hey, Amelia,” Mom comes in. “I’ve got some news for you.” <br />
<br />
	“What’s it about?” I asked.<br />
<br />
	“You know about Maryroad High School that Katie went to?” Mom answered.<br />
<br />
	“Yes,” I replied. “Why do you ask?”<br />
<br />
	“Because it has been invaded by a couple that wasn’t known until today,” Mom tells me.<br />
<br />
	“Oh, be real, Mom,” I answered with a chuckle. “The school has some security cameras and stuff, so there’s no way that’s really happening.”<br />
<br />
	“I’m not joking,” she insists. “Look at this email if you want proof.”<br />
<br />
	I take my mom’s phone to read what her email is about. My expression then turns from amusement to shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Angela Wilson, if you are reading this, Maryroad High <br />
School has been taken over by us. Ever since March of <br />
this year, we have thought about how horrible the anti-trans<br />
movement has been, from attacking their civil rights to <br />
limiting gender information on IDs to trying to remove books<br />
about them to eliminating drag performances to banning <br />
them from facilities and school activities to allow others to <br />
misgender them to censor discussions about them to even <br />
de-transitioning them, and we have concluded that all<br />
against this should have a taste of their own medicine. For <br />
your child’s future, he or she will be taken into Widow’s <br />
Spark High School accepting lessons for 9th to 12th graders. <br />
Maryroad Junior High will go back to having 6th to 8th grade <br />
classes, all elementary schools will have classes for <br />
preschoolers through 5th graders, and the intermediate <br />
schools will be the changing arena for the students of <br />
transformation. If you refuse to give your kid to us, you will <br />
pay us a $100,000 fine as a consequence. As for the <br />
teachers, all of the ones teaching 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th <br />
graders have been changed alongside the places and the<br />
staff from High School, so they will also help adjust your <br />
kid’s school life. We will still keep the current lessons for <br />
this place while adding a new one for your child. Please <br />
show up with him or her at the remains of Maryroad High <br />
School at 8:20 am on August 1st (if their last name starts <br />
with A-K) and 2nd (if their last name starts with L-Z) for <br />
your child’s future.”<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
						Katrina Jameson<br />
						and Jim Lessard<br />
<br />
	What in the world? Were they literally on drugs when making this letter? Are they both delusional or what? The threat isn’t helping things either, and the staff from Maryroad High School . . . will they really be okay? There are a thousand questions going on in my head, and I can’t get it straight at all!<br />
<br />
	“This is crazy!” I let out.<br />
<br />
	“You can say that again,” Mom comments.<br />
<br />
	“And the high school teachers,” I go on, “they all have changed along with both the school and the 9th grade ones, including those who would’ve taught me in the future.” Sorrow starts to fill my voice as I prepare to cry. “Why is this happening? I never did anything wrong to those people!” I hug Mom tightly.<br />
<br />
	“I know how hard it is for you,” she expresses, “and it’s all understandable.”<br />
<br />
	“What should we do? Go to the school and sign me in?”<br />
<br />
	“I know it sounds hard, but it’s the best solution I can come up with.”<br />
<br />
	“I just hope it all goes well.”<br />
<br />
	“As long as you’re safe, it will.”<br />
<br />
	I do my best to calm down. Having my school suddenly rearranged is bad enough, but when it involves my teachers, my classmates, and my future, that is a new low when it comes to crime. This is worse than any school shooting I can name! However, I still need to remain positive as awful as this is. The best I can do is hope that things can get better.<br />
<br />

<br />
August 2. 6:30 am<br />
<br />
	“Good morning, Ameilia!” Mom announces.<br />
<br />
	“Morning,” I grumble.<br />
<br />
	“Why are you so down?” Mom inquires before realizing why. “Oh, because of the new school?”<br />
<br />
	I shake my head up and down.<br />
<br />
	“Don’t worry, I’m sure it’ll go out fine,” Mom tries to assure me.<br />
<br />
	“But the Maryroad school program is great, so why do I have to be sent to a completely different one?”<br />
<br />
	“I know it’s frustrating for you, but if you have a good attitude, everything will turn out fine. Besides, we have God protecting us from any harm.”<br />
<br />
	“Yeah, well, I don’t know if he can help me through this nonsense.”<br />
<br />
	“I know he will. Now go and get dressed while I make your breakfast.”<br />
<br />
	“Okay.”<br />
<br />
	With that, my mom leaves the door open to allow me to get ready. I launch myself out of bed and take off my red gown and white panties. Well, boys, if you were curious to see me naked, then here you have it. Take my warning, though, because it may be too hot to handle. There is a pair of bouncy c-cup breasts that love being played around with my hands. My brunette bangs are fairly straight, and at the back, my long hair likes to cascade down to my ass, which is big and irresistibly fat. I have a lightly toned belly and a flawless hourglass figure to go with it. Combine those with my womanly thighs, and you would result in a fourteen-year-old girl being thick yet curvy in all of the right places. I think it’s time for you boys to stop gawking at my body and let me get my clothes on, so I put on my sky-blue panties and bra. I then put on my yellow blouse, black skirt with sunflowers, and a pair of matching black chacos.<br />
<br />
	I march off and head my way to my mom’s bathroom. I go through the short hallway, the living room, and my mom’s bedroom. There is blue wallpaper on three of the walls, and the wall with my mom’s queen-sized bed pushing on it is orange. I like to put my backpack, which is a multicolor, there near the door. There is a TV at the wall that has the door to the bathroom. There is also a soft brown chair for Mom to either watch sports or grade her students on an assignment. Below the TV is a black shelf with school binders and a bible, of course. On the left wall, there are orange curtains to fit with the window.<br />
<br />
	Finally, I arrive at the bathroom with orange walls. The next thing I do is grab the pink hairbrush and do my hair. While I’m doing that, I might as well tell you about the rest of this bathroom. There is a mirror in front of me to make sure I don’t mess up my hair, and in front of that is the sink. Behind me is the bathtub for my mom to bathe. Above that is a picture of two white chairs in front of the ocean waves and the word ‘relax&#39; with ropes making it up. There is also a tower with turtles when I look to the right, a window with light blue curtains, hearts drawn on the sand of the beach above the left of the tub, some lights above the wide mirrors, and another TV on the right of the said lights. If I look to the left, there is a mermaid catching a shell; both that and her tail is colored sea blue. Further in that direction shows a toilet with wipes, and when I sit on it, I see the shower with beige curtains in front of me. I finish brushing my hair and make sure it is nice and straight. During my younger days, my mom liked to put my hair in a ponytail because she didn&#39;t want to get lice in it, but starting today, I’m going to leave my hair down for mainly the rest of my school life. I then make my way to the kitchen to eat my breakfast.<br />
<br />
	Oh look! My mom already has it ready for me, which is really good. My breakfast consists of a glass of white milk, a bowl of cheerios, and a piece of toast with butter. What is standing on the bar is my pastel rainbow lunchbox. I bring my breakfast over to the dining table, and while I eat my food, I usually like to watch anime or any kind of video from my phone. While I do that, Mom leaves the house with me and my sleeping dad. Once I finish eating, I take around ten minutes to rest on the couch. After those minutes, I get up and go to the bathroom again to brush my teeth. When I’m done brushing my teeth, I grab my backpack, my bag with my phone and headphones inside, and my lunchbox to get to my grandma’s car.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
8:09 am, at Widow’s Spark High School<br />
<br />
	After going through some unbearable traffic, Grandma and I arrive at the school. Grandma parks the car in the parking lot, and she stops it not long afterwards. I know she might not be important to the story, but I’m going to tell you about what Grandma looks like. She has short white hair that can’t even reach her shoulders. Her shirt is made up of stripes of ocean and sky blue while having its short sleeves. Her jeans are navy blue while she has black shoes on.<br />
<br />
	“Okay,” Grandma requests, “be good.”<br />
<br />
	I don’t know if this is really possible for me to just get through this nonsense. I would explain why, but I think you already got the point. I get out of the front seat from Grandma’s beige car, get my stuff, and enter through the black doors. When I get to the building, the first room I enter is the gym. The floor is light orange while its center has the big letters WS, both of which are purple, to stand for Widow’s Spark High School. The walls are plain white with a blue and pink line above the purple gym bleachers on all of the walls except for the one that I came in. There are basketball hoops connected to the black ceiling. There are a bunch of students all around the room. I bet they’re probably just as unwilling to suddenly transfer as I am. <br />
<br />
	Ring! Ring! Ring!<br />
<br />
	That must be the first bell just now. I’m glad I made it right before then. I don’t like being late from the first bell because to me, it’s like being late to a meeting. Anyways, to pass the time, I choose to talk to . . .</p>
<hr/><h3>
Who do I talk to?</h3>
