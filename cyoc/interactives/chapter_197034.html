<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen’s grandmother took a deep breath and stretched out a bit (as much as her massive frame would allow). Jen got her attention by smacking the barrel again. “Ok grandma, you had just gotten well, and Uncle Terry was born, how much baby weight did you say you kept?” Mrs. Smith paused for a minute, thinking to herself about that time.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’d say around that time I was nursing him from my teats, I was around 410 lbs. Around that time, your grandfather started calling me big girl because I started losing my muscle from having to take care of the baby. I was a working girl, used to hard labor and carpentry, now I had to be a mother. Let me tell you, your Uncle Terry had it rough. I still remember trying to run after that boy several times, whipping him, trying to save him, trying to get him to wear clothes. I swear that boy was the spitting image of his daddy. Oh, right! A few years after your uncle was born, your grandfather got into a rut and impregnated me silly, which is why your daddy had so many siblings, and all of them the same age. He spent my entire pregnancy apologizing as he kept feeding me and feeding me. First were the triplets with your daddy in them, I had grown to be 7’ 5” tall and that pregnancy put me around 600 lbs.”<br />
<br />
One pregnancy put her to 600 lbs from 410!? Jen wondered how much weight she would gain if she were to have more than one horse child inside her at a time. She listened intently to the rest of her description.<br />
<br />
“Then came the quadruplets. Your granddaddy had a real time with them. I had gotten up to 650. And before you ask sweetie, yes I still gained weight despite being extremely pregnant. After the quintuplets, all my muscle was gone. I topped out at 7’ 10” and 750 lbs. and your granddaddy got snipped so I would never go through that again. That didn’t keep him from showing me a good time though. Boy, does he know his way around these handles, mmm…”<br />
<br />
Jen was losing her again, but she took a minute while her grandmother was distracted to process this part of the story. A total of thirteen foals took her from 375 lbs. to a whopping 750 lbs. Pregnancy made her grandmother put on 375 lbs. The very though nearly made Jen faint, that serum made her entire family pack on some serious mass. She’s heard of her Uncle Terry, Aunt Jessie, Uncle Phil, and Aunt Liz, but there were 8 other sibling of her dad she knew nothing about. But, she wasn’t done yet, the story had to continue. She smacked the barrel again to get her grandmother’s attention.<br />
<br />
“Uh, where was I again sweetie?”<br />
“All the kids are born, Uncle Terry was three, and you lost almost all your working horse muscles.”<br />
“Thanks dear, I’m glad your mind is still sharp.”<br />
<br />
“So here I was reasoning a three year old, 3 nine month old babies, 4 six month old babies, and 5 three month old babies. Your grandma only has two breasts thanks to the serum and we hadn’t experimented am enough with it to reverse the effects enough for me to get all my tits back without turning be back into a feral horse. We were in serious trouble and had to resort to traveling outside the farm to solve the problem. I barely had the strength to walk, but I carried on. There was a bunch of animals nearby in a crashed truck on the road just outside the farm property. Cats, dogs, rabbits, chicken, cows, pigs, and goats all surrounding the area. There were some humans there, but they were unconscious, so we rounded them up and brought them to the farm. After getting them all there, we saw what shape they were in, so we decided to give them all the serum in a form they could take it. The animals all ate and drank the serum laced items and we watched them change. Just like we had, they all grew in size, became bipedal, and gained a human-like body, and started out strong. The cows helped us feed our babies, and in return, we gave them a place to stay. We built out the barn again, making it closer to the megaplex of a home you see here. As thanks for that, your grandfather helped the others become a society and build stores for them. We put our kids through homeschool, but by the time Terry was grown, we had finally grown enough to have a majority of the town conveniences. A town hall, a few schools,  some stores, a park, an emergency services building, and a hospital. Because it was just a few animals, families had slow growth, but eventually, we had ourselves a thriving town. I sent all my kids out to find work and sell the towns products as soon as they were old enough. But your daddy was different.”<br />
<br />
She perked her ears up at that statement. “Different how?”<br />
<br />
“Well, for starters, the boy struggled to keep himself under control in a lot of things, and it got worse as a teenager. I had more times where I had to round up your father or your granddaddy would go after him more than any other child. He was always in something or doing something to someone. Couldn’t get a handle on that boy. So when the time came for him to start looking for work, I sent him with some serum and told him, ‘I want you back here every night, got it?’ Do you know how many times he nearly missed it, all because he had found himself a woman. They worked out being together for about five years before the farm they had shut down. He asked me to take ownership of this farm and with his father’s aging body, elected to give him a hand.”</p>
