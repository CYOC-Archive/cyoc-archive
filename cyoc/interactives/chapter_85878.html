<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Actually,” you say, even as you feel the urge to change starting to present itself more strongly in your mind again, “I have a couple more questions.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, Sir,” Mark the butler replies. “Though..I WOULD suggest you..*ahem*..not put off your transformation too overlong.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes narrow in suspicion at him. “If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d think you were rather excited at the possibility of me transforming.”<br />
<br />
“Well, yes..” he smiles apologetically. “This estate has long been without a master. Without sounding too pathetic, we&#39;ve all been eagerly anticipating the day that we serve a wolf again.”<br />
<br />
“That actually was part of what I&#39;d wanted to ask,” you tell him. “Without a master, what have you and the rest of the staff been doing all these years?”<br />
<br />
“Not very much, I&#39;m afraid,” he says flatly. “Without a master in the house, we&#39;ve been rather without direction. We&#39;ve maintained the house and property, naturally, and the house has continued to find a way to refill the pantry and kitchen, but beyond that, our days have been very long and mundane.”<br />
<br />
“So..the house never runs out of food?” you ask in a bit of shock.<br />
<br />
“No, sir,” he says with a slight bit of pride.”Rather fortunate, seeing as how noone can leave the grounds.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, good point,” you say with a nod. <br />
<br />
“Quite. Truly, it has been far from a hellish existence, though..without a master, we&#39;ve been unable to transform on more than the nights of the full moon, which has been a rather..sad cost of us losing our previous master,” he says rather wistfully.<br />
<br />
“I thought you called it a curse. You don&#39;t seem to be acting like it&#39;s a curse,” you tell him, acutely aware that your body is starting to heat up again. Foreign thoughts start to enter your mind, and you begin to find yourself thinking of how good it would feel to run and to chase prey.<br />
<br />
“Well, Master,” Mark says, smiling knowingly at you, “The previous master insisted on calling it &#39;The Curse,&#39; and the long-term residual effects of his willpower and presence make that a habit that&#39;s a bit difficult to break. Also, given that the origins of this manor&#39;s strange effects on those who dwell within are from a curse, it&#39;s also accurate, even though every servant here revels in the moon&#39;s effects upon us.”<br />
<br />
“So..uhh..” you say as thoughts grow stronger. You shake your head to clear it, and you&#39;re acutely aware that the colors in the room are considerably faded, though your senses of smell and hearing have definitely grown sharper. “Yeah..so..when your last master was here, you changed more frequently?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” Mark said with a nod. “The master has absolute control over his transformations, as well as the transformations of any of the staff. Nights where the moon is full are an inevitability, but other than that, his control was absolute. Without his presence, however, we found ourselves unable to attain the transformation without the moon&#39;s help.”<br />
<br />
“So..I can make any of you transform at will now?” you asked, unable to avoid thinking about the transformation. A soft rustle of fur growing on your arm grabs your attention, and you struggle to control yourself.<br />
<br />
“Once you YOURSELF have transformed for the first time, Sir,” Mark says with a curt nod. “While you&#39;ve taken possession of the mansion TECHNICALLY, you still need to claim dominion over the bestial affliction that resides in us all. When your howl echoes through these halls, announcing you as the powerful beast that rules us, it will bind our wills to yours, and our forms to your whims.”<br />
<br />
Your heart is pounding. You gulp hard, trying to push the thoughts back just a little longer. Your shirt begins to feel too tight, and you&#39;re aware that despite yourself, you&#39;re growing hard. You close your eyes fighting it back, forcing yourself to control it, though you can&#39;t be sure how much longer you can hold it off.<br />
<br />
When you open them, you notice no less than half a dozen women have found their way to the room, and more men and women linger outside the doorway. The women look at you with hungry, appraising eyes, as do even the men. Even Mark is letting himself survey your form with lingering eyes.<br />
<br />
“They can feel your animal ready to surface, Sir,” Mark said. <br />
<br />
“Umm..yeah..just..just one more question..and then I&#39;ll..uhh..” you say as you struggle to formulate a coherent thought, “..I&#39;ll..uhh..” a jolt of electric pleasure runs up your spine, making you shudder hard. “Mmmmhhh!” you let out a groan of pleasure, and everyone you can see reacts, shivering or gasping in a sympathetic reaction. More of the servants enter the room, eagerly watching your every move. “I..” you say again, closing your eyes. It helps slightly, but you can&#39;t shut out the smells of women growing moist, or the soft growls emanating from their throats. You can smell the slowly emerging wolf in their wetness, and even the scent of male werewolves&#39; arousal. You can hear more footsteps as presumably the remainder of the staff has entered the room outside, and more crowded inside to watch you.<br />
<br />
“Just tell us who you want,” Mark said as you opened your eyes.<br />
<br />
“I..want..” you said as your brain struggled to find the words. “W..ait.” you summon up all of your control to fight the animal down again. It&#39;s a struggle, but you succeed somehow. “I don&#39;t want to take someone who&#39;s already found a partner,” you tell the crowd.<br />
<br />
“Sir, our wills are bound to yours. Any of us would GLADLY lay with you or allow our lovers to join in the rut with you,” Mark says. “Now, or in the future. Now, Sir...I beg you,” he said, “Please..allow the beasts inside us all to reign again.”<br />
<br />
You look around the room and find your attention being caught by a busty woman in a maid&#39;s outfit. She looks in her late twenties, with long red hair, hanging in curly ringlets down to her mid-back. Her long legs make the french maid outfit look even skimpier, with the skirt hanging barely to her upper thigh. You lick your lips as your eyes linger below her waist, and your eyes lock on hers when you finally pull your gaze up. Her lip curls up as she growls at you, and her eyes fade from their deep green to a bright yellow. Your heart pounds in your chest as she approaches. You know the change is moments away, and even if you COULD stop it, you don&#39;t want to.<br />
<br />
“Change...” you growl at her as your voice gets a rough edge and sinks deeper.<br />
<br />
She stares at you, letting out a soft growl, followed by a small smirk as her mouth twists up into a seductive smile.<br />
<br />
“CHANGE!” You tell her again, pressing your mouth against her ear and nipping the lobe sharply. That electrical sensation is in every pore of your body. You feel almost as though you&#39;ll burst. Your heart is racing impossibly fast, and the combinations of male and female, human and wolf scents are overwhelming.<br />
<br />
She presses her body against yours and grinds against you for a moment, before pulling away and smirking again. “Make me..” she says, giving you a challenging grin, followed by a snarl.<br />
<br />
In a flash, claws erupt from your nail beds, and you rip her uniform top open and rake your claws down her tits, causing red fur to blossom on her chest. Your torso and arms swell with muscle as your body expands, and in a flash, you spin her around, pushing her to the ground roughly.. She tumbles to the floor, letting out a decidedly inhuman growl, a deep rumbling far less human than she&#39;d made a moment before. She looks over her shoulder at you, revealing sharp fangs as her jaw slid forward. She raised her ass up to you even as her thighs and calves swelled, stretching and ripping her stockings. The skirt hiked up from the growing mass of her form, revealing she&#39;d had no panties and giving you a full view of her wet and warping mound.<br />
<br />
You let out a howl of abandon, tearing hard at your jeans and boxers, slamming inside of her with a bestial aggression and instinct, fucking her hard as the two of you continue to change. All around you, the staff are shifting now too, tearing at their clothing and the clothing of anyone in reach, licking and biting at exposed flesh, as they join their master in the transformation.<br />
<br />
The redhead&#39;s breasts don&#39;t shrink away, as you rut, watching them wobble and pulsate, growing thick with fur as two more sets grow on her stomach. At some point you no longer notice the changes in either yourself or the staff, as it simply feels as it should be, no more amazing or strange than seeing a bird fly, or a fish swim.<br />
<br />
As you finally erupt in her, you let out an undeniably powerful howl of completion and dominion, one that made the windows rattle, and it&#39;s echoed by every werewolf watching you. Their howls modulate, joining yours in a chorus of subservience, recognizing you as the alpha, the lord and master of the pack and the territory.<br />
<br />
The wild strength leaves you not long after you&#39;ve climaxed, and you&#39;re aware of the world growing bigger-or rather you growing smaller, along with the rest of your servants. Soon, you find that you&#39;re naked and human once more, surrounded by men and women in tattered clothing, all bearing satisfied smiles. The redhead smiles at you, sitting up and nuzzling your chest. “Thank you, Master..” she says softly. “My will and my body are yours..” <br />
<br />
“Thank you, uhh..” you say, suddenly realizing you&#39;re not sure what to call her.<br />
<br />
“Cindy, Master,” she says, kissing you on the lips gently. “It was my pleasure to serve at your ascendancy.”<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but blush slightly. While you realize you&#39;re not an unattractive guy, and while you&#39;ve definitely not dated exclusively ugly women, as you see her naked body, you realize that she&#39;s far out of your normal league. If you&#39;d met her in the real world, you&#39;d never have the courage to ask her on a date. “I..uhh..” you say, as you struggle for words. Not because you were being overcome by bestial impulse, but because you genuinely were at a loss. “I think we both had some pleasure, Cindy.”<br />
<br />
She leaned in, flicking her tongue lightly over your lips and giving your chin a light nip. “I&#39;m at your service..” she pointedly looked down at your crotch, then back up to your face, “any time..any place..” she smiled as you shivered in undeniable enticement, “Any shape..” she leaned in more slowly again, whispering in your ear, “Any hole..”. You coughed in shock, stammering a bit of meaningless syllables. She smiled again as she got up and slowly sashayed away from you. She paused at the doorway, biting her bottom lip as she looked you over again, and then she left. <br />
<br />
The rest of the staff smiled at you, nodding in submission. As each left, they turned and said quietly “My will is yours.” Each left without too much lingering, though several were more than clearly interested about looking at your naked body. Soon it was just yourself and Mark in the room. He cleared his throat nervously.<br />
<br />
“Get me fresh clothes,” you said. You had a confidence now that you didn&#39;t have before. It wasn&#39;t a request. He was your SERVANT. He was below you in the pack. It was his duty to cater to your whims.<br />
“And then we&#39;ll talk about what comes next.”<br />
<br />
He nods curtly and begins to leave, but you stop him. “Mark,” you tell him, “Say the words.”<br />
<br />
“Sir?” he asked, seemingly confused.<br />
<br />
“Say the words,” you told him again.<br />
<br />
“Which words, Sir?” he asked, feigning ignorance.<br />
<br />
“You know exactly which words,” you growl at him.<br />
<br />
Mark put his hands up defensively. “Sir..what you&#39;re experiencing is common amongst new masters. Your brain is still struggling to process your new existence. Please Sir, calm yourself.”<br />
<br />
You pause. You know what he&#39;s saying is entirely plausible. You&#39;re not entirely sure whether or not to force the issue, and so for the moment, you relax, at least outwardly. “You&#39;re right,” you tell him. “Sorry about that. Just go get me my clothing.”<br />
<br />
“Very good, Sir,” he says, smiling in relief before heading to find you (and himself) new clothing, presumably stashed somewhere in the house. When he returns with your clothing, you dress as he waits, and part of you enjoys making him attend to you, to make sure he knows his place. While he doesn&#39;t seem to have any qualms about his duty, you are struck by the acute thought that something about him isn&#39;t quite on the level, and resolve to keep your guard up around him.<br />
<br />
“Show me to the library,” you tell him. “It&#39;s time I learned more of my territory.”<br />
<br />
“Sir..I can tell you anything you&#39;d-” he began.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t WISH for you to show me. I don&#39;t WISH for you to TELL me. I WISH for you to simply take me to the library, is that clear?” Your lip curls up in a snarl and you feel an unfamiliar anger rising in you. While you still can&#39;t discount his earlier statement, this doesn&#39;t FEEL foreign or unnecessary. You feel compelled to remind him of his place.<br />
<br />
The butler clenched his jaw, and for a moment you thought he might argue. But then he bowed his head in submission and softly said “Yes, Sir, right this way.” He led you across the house without a word, and other servants glanced in your direction and his, giving curious looks at both of you, clearly aware of a tension in the air. <br />
<br />
Mark pauses before opening a set of double doors which lead into an immense chamber, lined from floor to ceiling with books, the shelves of which are so high that a wheeled ladder is needed to retrieve them. More books run in smaller shelves, row upon row, through the middle of the room. You&#39;ve seen homes with libraries before, but this is something beyond anything in your experience.<br />
<br />
“If you like I can-” Mark begins.<br />
<br />
“No. Leave me. If I want you, I will have you summoned,” you tell him. <br />
<br />
The butler sighs heavily and quietly replies, “Yes, Sir,” before closing the doors behind you..</p>
