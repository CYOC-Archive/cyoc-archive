<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She escorted me into what appeared to be her own room.  There was a pile of coats on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this your room, Monique?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not much, but I like it.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I felt bad for her.  This was a very small room.  How could they shove her off in something barely bigger than a closet?  I put my coat down on the bed.  &quot;Don't you think it sucks for them to use your room as coat storage?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Joey,&quot; she laughed.  &quot;I have to be downstairs serving snacks and drinks anyway.  It does not matter to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hoped that this would work.  I silently wished that no one would realize we weren't downstairs.  &quot;What do you say we stay up here for a while?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked as a puzzled look came over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you would be attracted to me,&quot; I said.  <br />
<br />
Immediately her face changed to one of slight seduction.  &quot;Oh, Joey,&quot; she cooed.  &quot;You know how I love to see you come here.&quot;  Then she frowned.  &quot;But I have to go back downstairs.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Damn, I thought.  Not good enough.  I wished she would forget about her duties for awhile.  She stopped mid-turn.  &quot;Oh, they can manage without me for once,&quot; she said, a slight bit of venom in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; I agreed, &quot;You deserve a few minutes off.  You work hard for them.  I'll bet you did all of the preparation for the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;Mrs. Bockman did not help.  Mr. Bockman and Brad helped here and there.  Brad is such a gentleman.  Just like you, Joey,&quot; she said, running her fingers through my hair.<br />
<br />
I tried to compliment Brad and keep her attention on me.  &quot;He has nothing but good things to say about you.  I love it when he invites me over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do too, Joey,&quot; she said.  &quot;You are so handsome.&quot;  Her accent was really starting to drive me wild.  I wished that her uniform would slowly begin to slip off her shoulders and she would not do anything to stop it from doing so.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the black fabric started to slip down.  In a few moments, I figured, I'd be looking at her bare breasts.  &quot;Oh, Joey,&quot; she said.  &quot;We cannot do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked, noticing that her shoulders were now bare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone will see us.  I will be fired.  It is...impossible,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I'm the magician,&quot; I said.  &quot;This ring here will prevent that from happening.&quot;  I wished she would understand the ring's power as I had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui!&quot; she exclaimed.  &quot;You are right.&quot;  The look on her face turned to one of excitement.  She hadn't stopped running her hands through my hair.  Her uniform had slipped down to her elbows.  Yet her breasts were still covered.<br />
<br />
Even though I had wished no one would notice we were not downstairs, I decided to make sure no one would come upstairs either.  &quot;I just wish everyone would stay downstairs so that we can both do what we want to do,&quot; I said.  Her arms had totally slipped out of her dress, yet her upper body remained covered.  &quot;I wish that no one would hear us either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey,&quot; she said.  &quot;Are you sure you are ready for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; I said, quickly wishing that I would be able to please her.  &quot;How old are you, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am 24,&quot; she said.  &quot;You are only 18, I am sure.  But don't be afraid.&quot;  She leaned in and kissed me on the lips.  She felt around my neck and unclasped the cape I was wearing.  Then she started to unbutton my shirt, lifting it out of my pants and parting it to each side.  She continued to kiss me as she unzipped my pants, brushing her hands against my stiffening cock as she did.  I knew she felt it.  She let my pants slide down my legs as she took my shirt off my body.  I was left standing in only my boxers.<br />
<br />
She backed away from me.  Her hands reached up to her shoulders to take off her uniform.  But she touched nothing but her bare skin.  She smiled knowingly, somehow realizing my wish did that.  &quot;You naughty boy,&quot; she laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm about to be,&quot; I laughed back.<br />
<br />
She touched her uniform over her breasts and slowly, seductively slid it off her breasts.  They were large and inviting.  Her nipples were stiff.  She was as turned on as I was.  She continued to slide her uniform off.  She exposed her stomach, nice and flat.  She kept going, taking it off her hips.  I was surprised, as she revealed that she did not wear panties.  Her pubic hair was neatly trimmed in a thin line.  She turned around to give me a nice view of her shapely ass.  She dropped her uniform and kicked it off her feet.  She took off her shoes, leaving only her thigh-high stockings on.<br />
<br />
She walked back over to me and tugged off my boxers.  My now fully erect cock smacked up against me as the boxers cleared it.  She dropped them, too, and I stepped out of them.  She kissed me again a few times, and then said, &quot;Do as I want.&quot;  I was not going to disappoint her.<br />
<br />
She turned around and I madly kissed her neck.  She moaned in pleasure as I did.  She pressed her body closer against mine.  She seemed to be trying to get my cock's attention.  I positioned myself in order to insert my cock into her from behind.  It found the slit it was looking for.  I continued to neck on her while my hands reached around and fondled her breasts.  I squeezed her nipples between my fingers.  She moaned in pleasure as I continued to pump her from behind. <br />
<br />
Monique craned her head and neck back towards me so that she could kiss me back.  &quot;Oh, Joey,&quot; she moaned between our lips making contact.  &quot;This...is wonder...ful.&quot;  I thrusted into her harder and harder, feeling myself building towards orgasm.  &quot;Keep going,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'm almost...there.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I had wished I wouldn't disappoint her, but I didn't know if that would work this way.  I wished that I wouldn't come until she did.  I pushed harder and deeper.  She pushed back as hard as she could.  I felt myself about to explode.  I pushed harder yet and I felt my load escape into her.  She screamed in climax as I shot into her.  <br />
<br />
I felt my knees buckle under the pleasure.  I saw her do the same.  I turned around and fell backward on the part of the bed that wasn't covered with coats.  She fell on top of me.  I kissed her on the neck a few more times.  We both laid there for a few minutes, not moving.</p>
