<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Overly excited by the progression of the changes, Janet clicked on the bar and dragged the percentage all the way to the right: 100%<br />
<br />
This time, the changes started right in the center of her photo and seemed to ripple outward - her roughened nose turned almost black, as did the skin around it, spreading up to encompass her eyes and down over her new muzzle. Peering closer, Janet could see that this was short, dark fur, and as she watched it cover her face in the photo, she became flushed, feeling a pulse low in her core in response to what she was seeing. The fur began to lighten at the edges of her face, turning brown and then an almost silvery-tan, and she suddenly realized what sort of cat the editing software was turning her into: a Siamese!<br />
<br />
Her short hair had disappeared, replaced by a bit of tan fur in front of her still-dark ears. They seemed much more prominent now that they weren&#39;t poking out of her human head of hair! Her whiskers were white, contrasting sharply with her dark face. The silvery fur continued over her head and she finally noticed that her clothes had disappeared, her shoulders having slimmed down to a point that they were about the width of her furry neck and head. Her dark tail still rose from behind her, and Janet just wished she&#39;d uploaded a full-body photo so that she could see the rest!<br />
<br />
Still feeling oddly aroused from watching her photo morph, she dragged the cursor to the top-left corner - but when she clicked &quot;Save&quot; like she had before, a drop-down menu gave her two options: &quot;Save Photo&quot; or &quot;Save Progression.&quot; She wasn&#39;t sure how a &quot;progression&quot; would be saved (like, a video? a slideshow?) but she decided to choose that option since she&#39;d enjoyed seeing the different stages of the transformation.<br />
<br />
A chime sounded as she clicked &quot;Save Progression&quot; and Janet suddenly felt the heated-flush return, more intense than while she watched the changes on the screen. Standing, she went to the powder room and ran some cool water over her wrists. Glancing up into the mirror, she froze upon seeing her reflection: blonde hair was pulled up into a bun on top of her head, and her face... it looked... like that first photo edit she&#39;d done! Slowly raising her still-dripping hands, she felt at her thinner cheeks, long eyelashes blinking in wonder at her changed appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the... worrrld?&quot; she whispered, leaning closer to look at her enlarged eyes. Were they slightly ... blue? she wondered? The skin around her mouth was suddenly itchy, and she scratched at it, wincing when she felt how sharp her nails were. A strange tugging sensation engulfed her ears, and as she turned her head to watch, her left ear seemed to ... slide upwards, darkening and coming to a feline point!<br />
<br />
She gasped! &quot;HOLY SHIT! It&#39;s happening for REAL?!&quot; Janet&#39;s eyes were wider than ever before, lightening to an almost electric blue as she stared at her reflection. Her nose flattened and turned up as her mouth pushed forward, forming the slight muzzle she&#39;d seen in the photo progression. A sudden tugging on her tailbone had her grasping the sink and leaning forward, and she suddenly could feel something softly-furred snaking its way down her right pant-leg. &quot;Ohmrrgod. It&#39;s a tail. I have a tail! I have to get these clothes off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet struggled to strip, tearing a few holes in her pants and shirt as she did so thanks to her new claws. Her hands felt stiff and less dexterous, her thumb refusing to grasp as they should. She wasn&#39;t able to work the clasp on her bra, and her shoulders were spasm-ing, quickly making it impossible to reach behind her back anyway. They were shrinking inwards, and her bra straps fell down her arms first before the entire thing slipped in stages to her waist. Looking up from her shrinking breasts, she suddenly realized that her head was now level with the countertop, and quickly dropping!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh mrow!&quot; she pipped, her voice coming out raspy and tinier. Her new tail thrashed behind her in agitation, messing with her balance. She looked down and realized that she was standing on her tip-toes, although her feet seem to have stretched out, her heels much higher and her shins much shorter. As she watched, her big toe shrunk even as her other toes plumped up, forming into a cat&#39;s hind-legs even as they were rapidly covered by dark hairs. The fur spread up her legs, becoming the silvery-tan she now realized would soon cover her entire body. <br />
<br />
Sinking to her haunches on the bathroom floor, she could only remember how the rest of the changes had looked on her computer screen: her hair would be disappearing as her face was covered in dark fur, her big blue eyes taking up most of her feline face. Looking down, she watched as her thumbs shrank, leaving only a sharp dew-claw on the inside of her wrist while her other fingers shortened and plumped into front paws, also rapidly covered in dark brown fur. She could see her long, white whiskers sticking out to either side and in front of her face, and she let out a plaintive &quot;MEW!&quot; as she felt the changes come to a halt.<br />
<br />
Her ears twitched, and she could hear soft footsteps coming down the stairs. She&#39;d forgotten that Sam had gone up to his room after giving her the photo-editing software, and she tensed in fear at the thought of him finding her like this. The footsteps grew closer, drawn to the sound of the running water Janet had forgotten to shut off, and suddenly a young girl of about 8 or 9 stood in the doorway of the powder room, staring at Janet the cat in the pile of her clothes.</p>
