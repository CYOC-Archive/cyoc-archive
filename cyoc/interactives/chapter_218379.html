<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill wouldn&#39;t say he was necessarily unhappy in life. He just felt that he could be happier. With some tweaks. His relationship with his wife Teresa was ok, the sex was mediocre, but they always both came and enjoyed each others company. Lately however, she&#39;d become a bit of an insufferable know-it-all. She always had signs of it -- after all, Bill originally fell in love with her brains in addition to her moderately gorgeous body. Sure, Teresa didn&#39;t look anywhere close to a pornstar in proportions; but very few men were lucky (or wealthy) enough to tame such a mythical creature. Her ample C-cup breasts and workout-toned ass were always delightful. <br />
<br />
As much as she loved her, she had a bad habit of insisting on knowledge when she had no actual way of knowing or having never studied a topic before. A recent example was when she asked Bill to fix something with her computer, and spent an hour shooting down every single solution he proposed without having first tried it. He didn&#39;t talk to her for an hour after that.<br />
<br />
Lately though, he started getting frustrated in ways he couldn&#39;t really express without triggering the rare fights they would occasionally have. It would start with him saying something innocuous, and then her retorting with the assertion that he thought her place should be in the kitchen and let him talk, which had nothing to do with the argument at hand. They&#39;d &quot;make up&quot; without really making up, and life would go on. So Bill had taken to bottling up his frustrations.<br />
<br />
Until one day when he received the offer for the Chronivac by TransDem labs. For what it promised, even if it was a gag it would be worth the money to even try it out. One day, Bill rented a PO Box and placed the order. Within 2-3 weeks it arrived on a Friday. Without even hesitating he had paid the extra money for the Pro edition.<br />
<br />
After getting home from work that evening, Teresa called to let him know that she&#39;d be home later, and to save her a few slices of their favorite Pizza spot&#39;s pizza. Bill agreed, but he had a feeling pizza would be the last thing on her mind tonight.<br />
<br />
Bill carefully cut the tape securing the box, opened it up, and began reading the manual for the device. There was a section for &quot;First-time users&quot; to skim. It was full of basic warnings such as &quot;do not transform yourself in a way that changes your consciousness without first setting a time limit.&quot; It also offered an explanation for basic parameters that could be altered. Although the base version was quite limited in terms of range, the Pro edition had the ability to perform range scans, so that details could be modified at a distance before proximity application.<br />
<br />
Also, as the base edition only had an effective range of 30 meters, it did not have much governance over reality. With the Pro version, changes could be applied *through* a target. As an example, it used an imaginary woman named Mary. Mary had A-cup breasts. Through the chronviac, they made it so that Mary had D-cup breasts because &quot;women naturally have large breasts on average therefore Mary has D-cup breasts&quot; and suddenly the rest of the women in the office became more naturally endowed without so much as batting an eye. There was a bold caution -- affecting reality caused there to be a grace period of 24 hours before more changes could be made or reverted.<br />
<br />
This scenario alone gave Bill some ideas to compound to his existing ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
He pulled up Teresa&#39;s profile, and began digging into mental changes. Really the only thing he wanted to adjust was that insufferable know-it-all attitude at its root. But there were so many parameters, he felt overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
In his skimming, he found the category governing her &quot;common sense.&quot; It even had a history. He could see the uptick going back a few years. During the pandemic she had taken to consuming a lot more short videos. This mostly resulted in a variety of dinners that they&#39;d never even heard of, with about a 60% success rate. But obviously a lot of other voices were creeping in that werent related to basic hobbies. He could see videos about actualizing success through asserting your will on the universe, and other esoteric concepts like that. It was a whole side of Teresa she hadn&#39;t even hinted at beyond her attitude.<br />
<br />
Bill mused to himself, &quot;In a way, it&#39;s like her reality has already been swayed to someone else&#39;s perspective.&quot; as if to absolve himself of the guilt of what he was about to do.<br />
<br />
As he played with the settings governing her perception of the world, he decided to lock a few parameters. Specifically, he wanted her bathroom functions to remain mostly intact. He had some fun planned, but it didn&#39;t involve feces. However, he would erase her sense of what to do when she sensed the need to release her bladder. It would be really funny to see her squirm while an unknown pressure built within her.<br />
<br />
He left her fine motor skills intact, she&#39;d still know what stop signs and street lights meant, how to cross a street and not get hit by a car, how to avoid self-harm, and how to read -- though she wouldn&#39;t know the meaning of half of the words or phrases not directly related to her life. What she did know, would become highly malleable.<br />
<br />
For the Coup de Grace, he enabled the ability for reality to be affected by the changes made to Teresa&#39;s general knowledge. In doing so, it displayed a 60 minute timer ready to begin as soon as his changes were to be applied. He would have 60 minutes to convince her of a new reality. After which point he&#39;d have to live with the consequences for 24 hours. Just to be safe he made a quick backup of her profile. The instructions assured him that reality would return to the current state in time in which the backup was captured, after which point a 48 hour grace period would apply to the device.<br />
<br />
Billy would have his fun, then when he was done if it was too drastic he&#39;d change her back.<br />
<br />
He munched a slice of pizza and waited for Teresa&#39;s call. It came at about 8:30p, that she was roughly 10 minutes away from home. She asked him to draw a bath for her. Billy sweetly agreed to do it, but he knew she wouldn&#39;t remember what a &quot;bath&quot; was as soon as he saw her next.<br />
<br />
Billy sat in his favorite chair, his finger hovering apply. He was looking out the shades of the window, so when he saw his wife&#39;s car pull into the driveway it took everything he had to not instantly zap her. Billy was a little worried something would go wrong while she was parking the car, or locking it up.<br />
<br />
With full anticipation apparent between his legs, the second Teresa&#39;s foot touched the step up to their door, his finger slammed down. Time seemed to glitch momentarily. Bill waited for his wife to walk through the door. After a moment or two, he heard a sporatic tapping noise. He got up to get a better angle view of the door. Sure enough, Teresa was tapping the key she had in her hand against the door, not even coming close to the handle, a puzzled look on her face. It took everything Bill had to not burst out laughing at the sight. He didn&#39;t have too much time to spend goofing around though.<br />
<br />
(Teresa&#39;s perspective)<br />
She had a rough day at work, nothing particularly bad; just usual daily gripes and moans. Then of course there was the traffic, and the construction. Oh! If only she could give them a piece of her mind it&#39;d all be running ship-shape in no-time and nobody would have to suffer delays again. She wasn&#39;t really looking forward to slightly cold pizza, but there had been sandwiches ordered at the office earlier so she wasn&#39;t exactly hungry. She definitely needed the bath that Billy had promised her.<br />
<br />
Teresa got closer to the door, and walked up the first step. Suddenly, an empty musical note echoed throughout her mind. Suddenly, she felt like a core foundation of her world crumbled almost completely. Teresa blinked, unsure of what the feeling was. She looked in her hand. She was holding shiny objects that made noise when she shook them. She had them in her hand for some reason, but what was it...?<br />
<br />
She looked up from her hand, a solid wall in her way, with a metallic protrusion on one side. She had a feeling she needed to do something with the small noisy objects that would let her into this wall. Teresa tried holding them in one hand and sweeping her free hand across the surface. Next, she tried showing the key to the weird circle that was above the center of the door. Finally, she resolved that she must need to tap the objects against the wall.<br />
--<br />
<br />
Billy opened the door for Teresa as she brought the key down on his chest. She looked up, clearly flustered. &quot;Oh Billy it was so weird. For some reason I can&#39;t figure out how to work that thing? I&#39;ve been through there so many times before though. How did you open it so easy?&quot; She quizzed him. Fine motor skills were one thing, but actual knowledge of what something like a door seemed to be beyond her now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t fret hon, we just got a special lock for the door, don&#39;t you remember? All you have to do is tap your key on the door like you did and it will open, even if I&#39;m not here.&quot; he could hear the door changing, electronics surging throughout it. &#39;So far, 2 for 2&#39; Billy thought. Teresa followed him to the living room. He felt a little warm so he took off his shirt. Teresa gave him a glance with a mixture of questions, but remained silent. He filled the silence, &quot;What, it&#39;s warm in here. Why would we cover our tops when we&#39;re alone at home after a hard day of work?&quot; Teresa looked like she wanted to object, but his logic made just enough sense to what remained of her psyche. She unbuttoned her work shirt, but hesitated when she got to her bra. She pulled the straps down from her shoulders but was pulling on the cups quizzically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help you with that, come sit on the couch.&quot; He guided her to the couch. She didn&#39;t understand what he meant by sit. &quot;Here, like this.&quot; he theatrically demonstrated sitting down, and spread his legs. Teresa tried to emulate him, but she didn&#39;t quite nail the pose. &quot;Why are you sitting so stiff?&quot; Billy asked Teresa. She stammered, &quot;I-I feel so open and breezy down there if I don&#39;t...&quot; Bill fired back &quot;You&#39;ve never had a problem with being open in our home, as a matter of fact it&#39;s pretty normal for women that aren&#39;t at work to present themselves as open. It nurtures the feeling of trust, just like you told me last week.&quot; again, a bit of a questioning look before he watched the acceptance wash over her face and her legs part. &quot;Yeah of course, that would be pretty weird if I was some sort of old granny about such a normal thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s free you from this top.&quot; Billy walked around behind the couch and he freed her with one swift, practiced flick of the fingers. Teresa gasped in surprise as her Bra was launched free of its restraints to the floor. Billy circled back around to his chair, his dick straining painfully against his pants. So he unzipped and freed willy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Teresa exclaimed. Apparently this set off some alarm bells deep within her memories. Rightfully so, but not for very long. &quot; Do you even know what this is?&quot; he asked her pointedly. &quot;N-no, but there&#39;s got to be some reason you didn&#39;t have it out when I got here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shit, Billy had to think fast, &quot;It&#39;s because it&#39;s rude for men to publicly greet their wives, but it&#39;s not like something you haven&#39;t seen a thousand times. As a matter of fact, you&#39;re the one that told me you love seeing it all over the house. Are you ok?&quot; Billy kept on the gas. He knew it would be relatively easy to bulldoze his way through her objections this way, by giving her so many different things to process that she&#39;d just have to accept them all and move forward.<br />
<br />
Again, her face relaxed as she gained a little bit of a dreamy look in her eyes, now firmly fixated on his downstairs soldier. The sight of his wife sitting there, legs spread wide, topless, practically drooling over his dick (which she still wasn&#39;t even sure what it was beyond the thing she liked seeing around the house.) &quot;Hey, eyes are up here, remember?&quot; he giggled, as Teresa blushed and made a visible effort to move her gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, do you want to know more?&quot; He motioned to her, &quot;Come over here.&quot; She fearfully looked at the couch and the floor; she couldn&#39;t figure out how to stand up. Billy held back another laugh, &quot;That&#39;s ok, I can come over there and you can get a better look.&quot; He stood up and walked over, dick bouncing through his unzipped pants.<br />
<br />
He stepped one foot up on the couch, which placed his solid manhood squarely in front of Teresa&#39;s face. Her eyes were pacing up and down its modest length. She&#39;d &quot;never&quot; seen something like this before. &quot;Why don&#39;t you give it a little lick? Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t bite.&quot; He watch as she readied her tongue, and felt a chill run down his spine simultaneous as her clumsy exploration. He was almost ready to bust like he hadn&#39;t been in years.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; he asked. &quot;It&#39;s a little salty, but it&#39;s kinda fun to play with. What does it do?&quot; He grinned internally. Teresa&#39;d never been a blower before. &quot;It&#39;ll be a surprise for you, why don&#39;t you suck the end very very gently and use your tongue a little bit, and you&#39;ll find out before long, hehe. Oh whatever you do, do NOT touch it with your teeth or you won&#39;t get the surprise&quot; he made sure she saw him motioning to his teeth in his mouth. She began tentatively at first, with a gentle kiss on the tip, a little precum answered her sip. she pulled back in surprise. &quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; He quickly replied -- eager to continue, &quot;Surprises come out of the tip to let you know you&#39;re doing a good job. Keep up the good work for your favorite snack!&quot; Her look intensified into something more closely resembling a primal hunger. While she was still gently sucking, she was now going at it with much more purpose than before. Then, she began working her tongue and he was helpless.<br />
<br />
He basted the insides of her mouth with his pastry filling. He could see her swallow a little bit, before she opened her mouth and drooled a little into her hand and began to play with it, intensely interested in the strands that stuck to her fingers before licking her hand clean. &quot;You weren&#39;t kidding, that was sooo tasty! What do you call that?&quot;</p>
