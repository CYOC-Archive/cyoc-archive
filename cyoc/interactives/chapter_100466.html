<br />
The Stovalls sat around their modest sized dining table, an uncomfortable silence having fallen over the group. Martin needed only to mention that he was being called away to Seattle, and would therefore have to take his assistant with him, and his wife flew into a rage. Though it had been years since his last infidelity, Melissa still worried. Julie didn’t know about her father’s past mistakes, she hadn’t been born yet. <br />
<br />
Julie’s birth seemed to bring Martin to his senses about his poor judgement. But while he hadn’t cheated on his wife, that didn’t mean his eyes hadn’t wandered. <br />
<br />
“How was your evening with Eric?” Martin asked, finally breaking the tension. <br />
<br />
“Fine.” Julie said a little too quickly.<br />
<br />
“Are things between you two alright?” Melissa asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes. Well, I’m not sure really. Eric is so…”<br />
<br />
“Distant?” Martin offers, remembering his first encounter real with the boy. Eric had shown up at Martin’s office, asking for advice about dating Julie, and information about were-mer. Eric’s questions, while very intelligent and reasoned, in all honesty had very little to do with romance. He asked what kinds of things Julie liked to do as a child, if she had ever had a serious boyfriend, and the most awkward, if she had ever had intimate relationships with them. <br />
<br />
“I was going to say uncomfortable.” Julie said, shrinking into her seat. She never thought of Eric as distant, he was just a little out of touch with things. Did her father not approve? He had been so happy in the beginning.<br />
<br />
“Do you feel uncomfortable around him? Or is he uncomfortable?” Melissa asks.<br />
<br />
“No, it’s not like that. I meant he’s awkward about things. You know, he’s not a very expressive kind of person.” Julie clarifies. <br />
<br />
“I’m sure he’ll come around sweetheart. You’re his first girlfriend, and a lot of this is new to him. And I imagine part of him is still adjusting to Moon Lake.” Melissa assured her daughter. Julie’s face did brighten some after hearing her mother’s words. <br />
<br />
“I was wondering, would it be alright if I invited him to spend Thanksgiving with us?”<br />
<br />
“He probably has plans with his own family Julie.”<br />
<br />
“I know. But I still think I should offer. He mentioned that his family were going to be on their own for the holidays since they don’t have any family around here, and it’s too expensive to travel back to Minnesota.”<br />
<br />
“I’d say we should invite them all, but I don’t think your Grandmother would be too keen on four extra bodies, two of which are teenage boys. You know how your cousins can eat.” Martin said. His brother’s three boys were quite a sight. His mother prepared a set of dishes just for them since they ate so much. It wasn’t too much a surprise seeing as they were each athletes, and burned most of what they consumed at practices. The eldest of Martin’s nephews, Collin, would be playing against the Moon Lake football team that Thanksgiving. So, Martin told Julie she could invite Eric and his folks to accompany them.<br />
<br />
“That’d be nice. They don’t know a lot of people around here yet, and the game is always a good time.” Melissa nods approvingly. <br />
<br />
“I’ll ask Eric tomorrow!” Julie said, beaming from ear to ear. <br />
<br />
Despite their differences, Martin and Melissa exchanged a proud look when Julie wasn’t looking. She really did love Eric, even if he was a bit… well Eric. <br />

<br />
Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. Maggie Lawson no sooner asked when Jonathan was coming home, did he walk through the front door. He greeted his wife and then sister-in-law. Spencer was nowhere to be seen, he assumed she was upstairs. <br />
<br />
“Or she ran away,” he thought, only half joking. Another reason he and Elle would probably never have children of their own. <br />
<br />
Aside from the work and responsibility, they had different views on how to parent someone. Elle agreed with Evan’s choices, such as sending Spencer to a military school when she was ten. Jonathan did not. He didn’t understand why a father would do that to his child. While the rest of the family was under the impression Spencer’s rebellious streak was just a phase, Jonathan felt it was more due to the issues she had with how her parents kept such a distant between them. <br />
<br />
“Have a good day at work?” Elle asked.<br />
<br />
“Not a bad day, not a good day. Really boring to tell the truth. Which I guess is good considering the fact that had I been busy, someone’s house or car would have been up in flames.” Jonathan sighed, tossing his jacket onto the couch. <br />
<br />
“What about you two? Anything interesting happen?”<br />
<br />
“On my end, no just the usual. But Maggie ran into an old friend.” Elle said, smirking at her sister. Maggie grimaced. The only reason she told Elle was because she wasn’t aware he still lived around here. <br />
<br />
“Who?”<br />
<br />
“Just an old boyfriend/fiancee.” Elle giggled. <br />
<br />
“You were engaged before you met Evan?” Jonathan turned to Maggie, shocked to say the least. <br />
<br />
“It was stupid, we were in high school. He asked me as a joke, and I said yes. I don’t know what we were thinking, driving to Las Vegas. I can’t believe I could have ever been attracted to him, let alone want to marry him…” <br />
<br />
“And you would have married him if Dad hadn’t dragged your ass out of that sleazy chapel, and threatened to give Tony a vasectomy on the spot.” Elle laughs. <br />
<br />
Jonathan watches Maggie blush. He never took her to be the “wild child” type. In all the years he’s known her, she’s been quiet, well-mannered, and reserved. Whatever wildstreak she might have had fizzled out by the time Jonathan met her. <br />
<br />
“Who is this former fiancee?” Jonathan asked.<br />
<br />
“His name’s Anthony Davis.” Maggie said reluctantly. The last thing she wanted to do was dig up old demons. Then again, what did she expect, moving back to her hometown? So long as this conversation was kept between the three of them, she’s never told Evan about Tony before. He’s be livid. None of the adults realized Spencer was sitting and the top of the staircase, loving every minute of her eavesdropping. <br />
<br />
“Dinner and a show,” she thought, popping another Tic-Tac into her mouth. <br />
<br />
“And he was at the hospital?” Jonathan asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes. He, unfortunately, works there. He’s in the burn ward. His wife, Lucy, is a pediatrician in the children’s ward.” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“Are you going to see him again?” Elle asked. <br />
<br />
“Why the hell would I do something like that?”<br />
<br />
“Well you two did date for like three years. Off and on sure, but you almost married him. And he was, you know, your….”<br />
<br />
“Elle!” Maggie jumps to her feet, bright red at this point. Elle retreats, hands up in surrender. Which contradicts the mischievous grin on her face. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, just asking. So, did Evan call? Has he left by now?” Elle changes the subject before Maggie pops a vein. <br />
<br />
“He texted me two hours ago that he was boarding the plane. So he’ll be in Norfolk by ten tonight.”<br />
<br />
“How long is staying?”<br />
<br />
“Just long enough to make sure all of our stuff is packed and shipped. And then he has some paperwork to fill out with his C.O. Shouldn’t take more than three days.”<br />
<br />
“And in the meantime, we can get the house ready. Speaking of which, has Samantha Twist contacted you yet?” <br />
<br />
“Um, no? Should she have? I mean, I haven’t seen her in years, let alone spoken to her.” <br />
<br />
“That’s not what I meant. She’s the chancellor now, so you should be getting some sort of welcoming. Even if you aren’t normals.” Elle adds.<br />
<br />
“Well it will be nice to see her again. She and Francis have a son don’t they? He must be about Spencer’s age.” Maggie asks, recalling the Christmas card she’d gotten in the mail some ten years ago. She hadn’t seen Sam and Francis so happy, not since their wedding day. Which was a bit awkward since Francis’ family wasn’t the most gracious of in-laws. <br />
<br />
“You’d have to ask her, I have no idea. Truthfully I don’t keep in touch as much as I should. I see them when I go into town, but that’s about it.” Elle admitted, a little ashamed they weren’t as close as they had been while in school. She and Sam were lots of classes together, they’d been like sisters. Then college and life got in the way, and they lost touch. <br />
<br />
The sisters continue to chat about their adolescence, and Jonathan decides it’s best to sneak out. They haven’t seen each other in a long time, what with Evan’s job keeping them on the other side of the country. The last time Maggie came out it was for fathers’ funeral, and that was certainly not a time to catch up. <br />
<br />
Jonathan begins to climb the staircase when he notices a pair of legs jump up and run in the other direction. <br />
<br />
“Snooping isn’t polite Spencer,” he tells his niece. Spencer stops in the doorway of her room, which was once Jonathan’s private work space. <br />
<br />
“I was bored, and besides they’ve been talking down there for hours. I’m starving.” she complained. Jonathan smiles and suggests that they order-in. Spencer doesn’t object, knowing that once her mom and aunt go into “girl talk” mode, there’s little chance of snapping them out of it. They’ll talk each other to sleep, literally.</p>
