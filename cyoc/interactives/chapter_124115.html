<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You want to hang around with these guys, you&#39;re excited by the thought of having these straight thugs as your friends. Besides, by keeping them close you can maybe decide to swap with one of them later. &quot;How about my apartment,&quot; you suggest casually. &quot;Apartment? How are you gonna drop that so casually?&quot; Javier says, pushing you a little. &quot;Nahhhhh, he&#39;s bullshitting for SURE. Sasquatch doesn&#39;t have any damn apartment.&quot; You are a little stung by this, you think, as you look down at your still-huge feet. However, in the back of your mind you remember that you guys always fling insults around when you chill. &quot;I&#39;ve had one for years,&quot; you say, although you remember with your new younger age this isn&#39;t true. &quot;Months, I mean...&quot; Everyone around you gets a glazed-over look in their eye before they begin to nod. &quot;Right, yeah...&quot; Javier says, &quot;how could I forget?&quot; You guess that the magic is still working out some inconsistencies in this reality shift. &quot;Y&#39;all must be higher than me,&quot; Fries says, &quot;we were there last week.&quot; Marley throws his arm over your shoulder. &quot;You got beer?&quot; You nod and the five of you keep walking. You take a closer look at everyone on your way there.<br />
<br />
Thad, short for Thaddeus, is the funny one in your group of friends. He&#39;s also overweight, which makes him the fattest one as well. Everyone else is lean or stick then, and Thad&#39;s massive belly must fill out an XXL shirt, maybe bigger. Usually he wears expensive looking t-shirts with psychedelic patterns, basketball jerseys, and crisp-looking Jordans. He&#39;s fairly tall, 6&#39;1&quot;, which makes his weight look a little more normal... but only a little. Thad is Jamaican, and although he&#39;s never been there, he doesn&#39;t let that stop him from punctuating his speech with patois. He&#39;s a smart guy, probably the smartest in your group too, but he tries not to brag about it. His skin is a medium brown umber tone, usually glistening with sweat as he tries to force his large body to keep up with the rest of you. Thad&#39;s hair is buzzed short, with faded sideburns. All his features are big; his eyes look like dinner plates on his round face. It&#39;s probably a good thing he&#39;s got some extra weight to his face, because otherwise those features would take up his whole head. Your friend likes to complain about how much walking you make him do, but his parents are loaded; he even buys the five of you an Uber from time to time. At least he isn&#39;t stingy. He usually spots you all weed and MDMA when your wallets are lean, which is often. Although... no, you remember, you work at an office. Money isn&#39;t that tight. These conflicting memories are definitely making your brain ache...<br />
<br />
Fries is undoubtedly the dumb one, and it&#39;s hard not to notice. Even now, his mouth is agape and he looks lost. He&#39;s been adhering to the stoner&#39;s law of S.W.E.D. since he was in his early teens, and maybe it killed a few too many brain cells. His haircut and soul patch are like a mess of squiggles on his head, wildly flowing out in all directions. His hair only had a little length to it, but it still managed to puff out in many small, dark blond spikes. His eyes are sunken and puffy on his pale face, a result of too many late nights and fat blunts. His eyes are a little close together too, his nose round and small. These features only enhanced his appearance of stupidity, unfortunately for your bud. Fries wears a lot of track suits and sweat pants, neither of which do much to hide the outline of his massive dick. Everyone in your group must have noticed by now, although Fries probably had no clue (as always). It&#39;s nice he was blessed with something at least. He&#39;s not very tall, only 5&#39;7&quot;, and is stick thin. Perhaps verging on gangly, he&#39;s a little clumsy due to his knobby knees and big hands and feet. He usually ends up as the verbal punching bag of the group, but he&#39;s a loyal friend, really; he usually is out to make sure everyone has a good time.<br />
<br />
Javier is your oldest friend. The two of you went to elementary school together. Sometimes after school, his abuela used to make you both pork posole, fresh tortilla bread, or mango con chile. Her cooking was so good you used to beg Javier to let you come over every day; usually this would mean he would rope you into tons of mischief. It was easy for him to do; Javier is very charming. He&#39;s pretty good looking too -- so he&#39;s pretty popular with the opposite sex. He has a long, square jaw, and his facial hair always looks effortlessly stubbly. His eyes are a light brown color, which look striking in the right light. His nose is a bit crooked from fights, won and lost. He keeps a tight fade on the lower half of his hair, and the top is styled to look messy. It always looks wet; his short curls are glistening in the fading afternoon light. He has a thin build with a little muscle mass; something approaching athletic, but not quite. Javier lifts weights occasionally, so his arms are the most muscular part of his body, but they are far from intimidating. His legs, covered in a forest of curly jet-black hair, look like lollipop sticks jutting out from his Adidas athletic shorts in comparison. He loves to wear muscle shirts that expose his somewhat hairy brown chest, even when it gets cold (then he justs adds a denim or leather jacket to the ensemble). Although you&#39;re close with the guy, and would do anything for him, he can be a bit of a jerk from time to time. He doesn&#39;t usually let things get in the way of what he wants. That concerns you, the rational you who isn&#39;t used to these changes... you&#39;ll have to be careful with your ring.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is Marley. He&#39;s black Irish; you can see it in his dark eyebrows and 5 o&#39;clock shadow. However, he made the questionable decision to dye his hair bleach blond a couple weeks ago. You and the guys haven&#39;t stopped giving him shit since; Thad has been calling him &quot;Barbie&quot; when he thinks he can get away with it. Marley is probably the toughest out of you, with a couple healed-over scars on his hands and face. He played football in highschool till he got kicked off the team for drunkenly smashing the windows of the assistant coach&#39;s car one evening. That was how you and Javier had met him, he just started showing up to smoke sessions one day after losing his position as an athlete. He&#39;s not beefy, but has a good amount of hard-earned muscle on his arms, legs, and chest from his current construction job. He goes to the gym sometimes and is always bugging the rest of you to go with him, but no one ever obliges. His clothes are hopelessly out of touch; he sags paint-flecked athletic shorts and sawdust coated jeans, and wears ratty looking flannel button-ups. His face is quite handsome however, not quite as universally appealing as Javier&#39;s looks, but enough to get him by. Marley has narrow-shaped ice blue eyes, which look thoughtful and wise even though he&#39;s about as deep as a puddle. His nose is a little on the long and thin side, but it works with the rest of his features. His looks toe the line between rugged and baby-faced in a strange way, although girls seem to like it just fine. He&#39;s a bit of a loudmouth, and has a hot temper, but usually it&#39;s not directed at you or the other guys. His arms are covered with tacky-looking, sometimes crooked tattoos; he&#39;s proud he got most of them for free, but that much is apparent to the rest of you. His forearm has a shakily lettered year, written vertically, and a ghoulish looking drawing of Bob Marley; that one he likes to reference, reminding everyone they&#39;re both &quot;Marley&quot;.<br />
<br />
You arrive at your apartment, and the five of your crack open a 24-pack together. The late afternoon quickly becomes late evening, and your apartment quickly becomes a mess. It bothers you a little, but the &quot;you&quot; in the back of your mind doesn&#39;t mind too much. Not the worst they&#39;ve ever done, that&#39;s for sure. You notice with a little excitement that it&#39;s getting close to midnight. Fries is rolling a fat blunt while Javier and Thad talk shit about his technique. Marley is distracted on his phone, probably texting about 50 different girls hoping for a hook-up. You glance over at the clock as it rolls over to midnight, meaning your ring is once again fully charged.</p>
