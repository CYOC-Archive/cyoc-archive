<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“If you’re going to keep being a lion, you’re going to need to do what I say…” Colin relented, offering a lifeline to the pitiful big cat locked in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Yes! Okay!” Her voice perked up immediately as Colin turned the doorknob, opening it just for the lioness to burst out.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thank you, thank you! I promise I’ll be really good and-“<br />
<br />
“Sit!” Colin raised his palm in the air like he was commanding their old Rottweiler, Queenie, that passed away a few years ago. The lioness froze, looking at Colin in confusion then in disbelief. She seemed stunned that he’d order his big sister around like that, but the boy was dead serious. She soon relented, sitting down on her haunches like an obedient dog.<br />
<br />
“Now, stay!” Colin commanded, Alex’s ears twitching as her tail impatiently slapped the ground.<br />
<br />
“I won’t move if you don’t want me to…” She spoke, still off-put by the sudden pet-like treatment. “But you don’t have to talk to me like that! I’m not a dog! I’m still me, you know.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve never dealt with lions before, but I’ve dealt with dogs.” Colin explained trying his best to look confident in front of his beastly sister, “And I know that goes the same for you. You’ve had a dog before and you know how to act like one, so this is going to have to be how it works for the time being. You said you’d do what I want, and this makes me feel safer around you. If we’re going to try to change you more, this is the only way I’ll do it.”<br />
<br />
“Colin, come on! I promised I’m not going to hurt-” She stopped herself, sighing as she straightened up her stance, realizing she’d already broke that promise more than once. “Okay, fine.”<br />
<br />
The boy raised a skeptical brow and stood there in front of his leonine sister, staring each other in the eye, wondering if she’d lose it and break her promise. For a full two minutes, Colin just froze there standing a few feet away from her, praying Alex would do the same as he thought about what to do with her.<br />
<br />
Alex complied at first but rapidly grew impatient. Her tail started to slap against the carpet behind her again, her uncut cock peeking out as a half-chub from under her belly as she began to look agitated.<br />
<br />
“You can… like, do stuff to me, you know…” Alex suggested, a sensual huff punctuating her offer. “I’ll stand right here… I won’t move no matter what you do. Just… please…”<br />
<br />
That fuzzy leonine paunch wavered along with her flanks, Alex’s body suggesting that she was just about to jut forward, but she didn’t act on it. Jittery and restless, she still managed to stay in one place, even though she clearly had other things on her mind.<br />
<br />
“Like, seriously. Bite me. I mean, you can bite me anywhere if you want. I’ve been bad to you, so I deserve it.” Her voice quivered, a little drool lathering her words as her human cock waggled erect underneath her. “Anything you want. You can play with my butt again. You can stick your dick in my ass, seriously. Or you can like, hit my cock or something… whatever… I dunno…”<br />
<br />
“Alex…” Colin groaned. “You’re being weird again… just stop…”<br />
<br />
“Eeeuuuggghhh…” She twitched, fighting the desire to leap at her brother. “… I think my dick can turn into a pussy if you play with me! It felt like it was doing something when you were messing with my butt…”<br />
<br />
Here eyes flittered like a harsh glare was shining right in her face as she tried to look Colin in the eye. “Please… you’re the only male around… the only one I trust. I’ll be Nadia for you and let you do anything… anything…”<br />
<br />
Colin didn’t know what to say, giving her an incredulous look as her feline face reflected a deep desire. He didn’t know what to say, letting that extended pause between them stretch out longer and longer, giving time for the both of them to absorb this all.<br />
<br />
“…Still feeling nauseous?” Colin tried to change the subject, wanting to make sure she felt alright from that violent bout of vomiting earlier. “I didn’t even look at the toilet to see how bad you threw up. Do I even want to…?”<br />
<br />
“It’s not really anything solid.” She reassured him with soft nod. “No meat in there, the throw-up’s just black – like, tar-black…”<br />
<br />
That didn’t sound good. The last thing Colin wanted to do was have to call 911 for his big sister and have to explain why there’s a lion in his house, but black vomit sounded bad – really bad. He wanted to see how bad it was, but he really didn’t want to look in the toilet.<br />
<br />
“Should I, like… call a vet…?” Colin asked.<br />
<br />
“No, it’s coffee. I’m sure of it.” Alex’s broad maw huffed out a sigh, nudging Colin on the head as she did. “I brew like, two pots of coffee for myself every day and I was already on my second pot when mom got up in my ass. It’s how I stay lean, you know – it’s why I didn’t tend to eat much food.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess that makes sense…” the boy nodded along, peering down at the bathroom floor right at the base of the door. It was splattered with Alex’s cum too, her seed even streaming down the door she’d been gashing at with her claws. Mom really wasn’t going to like that…<br />
<br />
“Too much Caffeine. I bet it’s bad for cats.” Colin kept on topic, “At least it sounds like something that’s bad for cats. If you got it all out, that’s good. And… you said no meat was in there?”<br />
<br />
Alex nodded her muzzle. “Yeah. I digest that stuff really well now. I think it all went into my body mass as I was changing. The app must’ve needed all that meat to make me a lion.”<br />
<br />
“Alright. I guess if you feel okay…” Colin trailed off, scraping the carpet with his foot as he turned away from her towards the staircase.<br />
<br />
“Now I’m going to get some stuff so ‘stay’ right here. If you do what I say, I can maybe help you deal with that.” Colin pointed down to his sister’s penis before he climbed down the stairs and made his way towards the kitchen. Stepping out the side door to the garage, the boy began searching for some things that’d help for what he hand in mind.<br />
<br />
After about a half-hour, Colin scampered back upstairs, spotting Alex still sitting there on her leonine haunches, her face confused, unsure of what to make of that box of junk that Colin was carrying.<br />
<br />
“What’s all that stuff?”<br />
<br />
“This is…” Colin plops the cardboard box he was carrying on the ground in front of his sister. “… is how we’re gonna make you safe for me.”<br />
<br />
Alex peers over the edge as Colin fishes through it, the boy digging out some stuff the lion recognized from their deceased pet dog, Queenie. It was her collar, her leash, and a muzzle.<br />
<br />
At first Alex still didn’t get it, not until Colin unlatched the collar with the leash connected to it, holding it up to his sister’s neck.<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me?!” The lion’s voice grated into a faint hiss, “That’s stupid! What, are you gonna take me for a walk down the street!? And you know it’s not gonna work anyway! If you’re on the other side of that leash, I can 100% guarantee you that I can out-tug you!<br />
<br />
“It’s not for walks.” Colin asserted, pressing that pink collar against her neck, working to close the latch. “And you told me you’d do what I say. And this is going to make me feel safe around you.”<br />
<br />
“Fine…” Alex begrudgingly accepted it, tilting her head upwards to give Colin room to rope the collar around her. “I’m not… completely against collars and leashes, I guess. But… what about that…?”<br />
<br />
She was referring to the muzzle Colin had taken out, the boy picking that up once the collar was fastened around her. He brought it up to the lioness, opening the straps and holding it out to her snout.<br />
<br />
She shook. A growl escaping her throat as she pawed backwards before remembering to sit back down again.<br />
<br />
“I swear to god… you don’t need that… thing.” Alex averted her snout away from the cage of the muzzle, refusing to put it inside. “Do you… really think I’m going to eat you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think YOU want to eat me.” Colin beckoned her to look straight at him again. “I’m afraid that lioness in front of me is gonna forget her own strength and kill me! If you want me to help you with your penis problem, you’re gonna have to wear it!”<br />
<br />
Alex grit her teeth, those big blue eyes tearing up as she shot him another pleading look, but he was insistent. Slowly, she moved her muzzle back in place, her mouth shaking as it got hidden behind that plastic restraint.<br />
<br />
“It’s so… degrading…” her somewhat muffled voice whimpered from the muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Well, we aren’t done yet.” Colin replied, lifting up the box of junk and beckoning Alex to follow him with a tug of her leash. “We should probably do this in your room. It’s already pretty dirty from before so it wouldn’t be so bad if we get it dirtier.”<br />
<br />
Alex reluctantly went along with him into her room, her head hung low as that dog muzzle tightly constricted her felid snout.<br />
<br />
“Alright, umm… can you lay down on your side?” the boy asked, digging through the cardboard box to pull out a set of small bungee cords.<br />
<br />
“What… are you going to do with those?” Alex mewed coldly; dejection already planted on her feral face.<br />
<br />
“Just stretch out your hindlegs and don’t move them, alright?” Colin said, kneeling down near her rear end, hooking the two cables around each other as he grabbed for the lioness’s hindlegs. Alex’s paws reluctantly arched backwards, only for her little brother to wrap the cords tightly around her leg just above the paw. Once he completed the circuit and hooked the two cords together again, Alex flexed her powerful femoral muscles, finding she couldn’t pull them apart due to the binding: she’d been wrapped up like a turkey in twine!<br />
<br />
“Colliiinnn…!” She groaned out a rumbly whimper, her legs twitching violently, muscles in her legs desperately firing on all cylinders as they tried to regain motion. She was like an animal stuck in a snare, her human brain losing control as her pleas began to hiss and rumble in her throat. “Get it off! Rrra… I’m starting to freak out!”<br />
<br />
“Almost done! Just relax, please!” Colin pet along her flanks, trying to hold her firmly in place as that powerful mass of leonine muscles wrapped around her flanks clenched and writhed, protruding obnoxiously from her underneath her furless sweaty hide. Despite mustering the strength of several adult men to try to tear those binds off her hindlegs, she couldn’t get them to budge, her rear rolling around on the carpet pathetically as she exhausted herself trying to get free.<br />
<br />
“Crack!”<br />
<br />
Colin bounded out of the way just in time as her massive flanks swung back towards where he was, her ass slamming her bedroom’s nightstand against the wall shattering one of the legs into splinters! Her alarm clock, a lamp, and a diary got flung down towards the floor as Alex kept gurgling out furious growls, her human penis flailing excitedly against her fuzzy feline belly as it sullied her leonine belly with little dollops of pearly white semen.<br />
<br />
“Alex! Stay! Stay!” He belted out desperately, trying to command his sister like a dog like before, but to no avail! She wasn’t listening!<br />
<br />
Before Alex could cause any more damage that they’d have to explain to their mom, he undid the belt wrapped around his pants, bringing the leather strap up behind her head. “Stop moving and stay, Alex! Raise your paws behind your head! All the way up!”<br />
<br />
“No… not those paws too!!” She growled, vocal cords merging human speech with leonine roars. “That’s gonna drive me crazy! Arrrhhn…! It’s gonna huuuurrrttt!”<br />
<br />
Her claws splayed out into several inch long knives as they cut up chunks of carpet like tissue paper. Colin reached for his sister’s phone, deciding now was the time to change the spiraling Alex back! But… he couldn’t find it! His eyes scanned the room for it and her writhing, she must have kicked her phone several feet to the other side of her giant feral form, far out of Colin’s reach!<br />
<br />
He did the last thing he could possibly think, yanking at the scruff of her neck like a momma cat would do to calm down a kitten, digging his fingers into her furless hide as he pulled back as hard as he could, hiking up that felid dewlap of skin as high as he could get it!<br />
<br />
“W-what…?” The lion bellowed a bellicose whimper, her claws still feebly gripping at the carpet, managing only a flick of movement in her huge paws. Her body went limp, flopping around weakly several more times as one last spurt of seed welled out of her squishy, erect human cock. She turned her head back just enough to catch Colin gripping her scruff behind her, eyes blinking at him in animalistic confusion as her lioness instincts sensed she didn’t have the upper hand anymore. “Rrraa… let go…!”<br />
<br />
“STAY! PAWS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!” Colin shrieked through his teeth; his knees arched hard against her broad leonine back as he tugged with all his might. “DO IT OR I’M CHANGING YOU BACK!”<br />
<br />
“Rrr…” Her growl trilled off into a muted feminine snivel. “But, but… rrrr…” She mewed, her teeth clanging together like daggers as she scraped them against each other in her man-eater of a mouth. “I can’t move them… very much… the way you’re holding me. It’s not fair, you’ve gotta let me g-”<br />
<br />
“Like hell I am…!” Colin was the one growling now, mustering another ounce of strength, tugging her so hard she shut up like a little kitten. He felt his knees rubbing against soft hairless animal hide on her back now, meaning she wasn’t able to flex her muscles anymore. The only sign of life was a little twitching and a loud gulp from her throat, those blue eyes of hers turning unclouded and humanly blue.<br />
<br />
In one swift motion he let go right before tugging her paws behind her head and wrapping them up as tight as he could get that belt loop to go. It took Alex a couple seconds to start to regain motion again, by then she was already hog-tied, bound by both legs and huffing loudly in her dog muzzle.<br />
<br />
Colin stepped over top of her, scooping up her phone as he sat on the edge of her bed, looking at his handiwork as the lion lay there on her side, deprived of moving any of her limbs.<br />
<br />
“I thought you wanted me to help… you’re too much to handle…” Colin panted as that sudden burst of adrenaline emptied from his system, leaving him on the verge of collapsing. He fiddled around with the phone he’d set on the side of her bed, looking at Alex as he contemplated her fate.<br />
<br />
“Can you… move at all…?” Colin asked the dazed lioness.<br />
<br />
Instead of responding, she flexed her entire body once again, muscles rippling hard edges against her soft feline skin as her claws retracted to deadly points. Yet with all that effort she only managed to fidget and roll around on the floor as her limbs stress-tested the strength of those snares wrapped around her legs. They held.<br />
<br />
“No… It hurts.” Her voice dripped with a pitiful cry, “You didn’t have to do that… I swear I only freaked out cause I didn’t know you were going to tie me up! I’m fine now… just take them off…”<br />
<br />
Her penis was still standing on edge, leaking out the slightest dribbles of human cum onto her furless belly. Her eyes clenched and she bit her tongue as she whimpered out a yowl, her penis flexing again as a dry orgasm rocked her twitching rear.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to deal with that, alright…?” Colin sighed, referring to her prick. “Maybe it’s that… maybe it’s just that that’s making you freak out. You’ve cum like, four or five times now just in here. Does cumming hurt?”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t hurt… It’s… it’s just…” She rumbled through her plastic dog muzzle as she rode that last orgasm to its end. “I don’t know! It’s just frustrating, okay? It’s like…”<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment, tail lashing so hard against the floor it splashed latent dust from the carpet beside her bed into the air.<br />
<br />
“It’s like… when I was a human, I’d always be jerking off to the thought of myself being a lioness… and now that I am one… It just keeps cumming. It. Just. Doesn’t. Stop!”<br />
<br />
“It… really feels as good as you fantasized it would?” her younger brother asked.<br />
<br />
“Better.” She murred, drooling in her muzzle as her penis lost some of its hardness, still standing on edge as it sensually rubbed against her taut tummy.<br />
<br />
“Okay…” Colin huffed out an exhausted puff of air as he slid off the bed. “I’m gonna have to frustrate you a lot more before we’re through… just stay, alright? Stay.”<br />
<br />
“Just do it, damn it…” Alex snorted, still resenting being treated like a dog. Her brother dug inside the plastic box, pulling out some oven mitts before he made his way toward her tied-up hind paws. These weren’t the ones made to just put on your hands, they were meant for placing both hands inside to pull heavy casserole dishes from the oven. They were huge, big enough to fit a basketball inside, and fortunately for Colin, just begin enough for four to cover each paw, burying those fearsome claws away.<br />
<br />
Colin stood up after he capped off each paw, looking over his handiwork as his sister laid on the floor like a twined-up roast. She was still mewing out muffled up feline murmurs, but she seemed calm now, nothing but her tail moving as she finally heeded his commands to stay. He pulled out two longer bungie cables and connected one to the belt around her forwards and one of the legs of the bedframe, while the other connected the cords around her hindpaws to the dresser. Now she couldn’t even roll around much.<br />
<br />
“Woops. Hold on, I’ll be right back, just stay!” Colin remembered, running out of the room and barreling downstairs as he grabbed something from the fridge. In less than a minute he was back in Alex’s room, his sister-turned-lioness’s nose twitching as she smelled what Colin had brought for her.<br />
<br />
“Here, just a little fuel. Judging by all the meat it took from the first time you changed, might need it to help the change down there too.” The boy knelt beside her head, gently taking off the muzzle, eliciting a pent-up gasp from the big feline as her head popped free. “Here’s the last of the meat from the bridge. Five chicken breasts, I think. Not cooked though, does raw work for you?”<br />
<br />
The feral cat licked her chops as her brother hung of a slab of pink chicken meat above her head.<br />
<br />
“Raw is fine.” She said hurriedly, suddenly feeling voraciously hungry all of a sudden. “I mean it should be. Let me check.”<br />
<br />
Colin lowered the meat into her mouth, her maw sucking in the morsel of meat, chewing twice before swallowing it, a tender purr leaking from her lips.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, raw is fine. Even better, actually. Give me the rest.”<br />
<br />
Her little brother pushed the try of chicken breasts to her head and let her go to town, the boy stepping back as his animal of a sister scarfed down one slab of meat after another in mere seconds. Colin flicked open the Yiffr app on Alex’s phone, curious about how much that meat took her to getting her to the next stage of her change.<br />
<br />
“Just 5%...?” Colin whispered to himself. If each of the chicken breasts weighed one pound, that means she’d need to eat 100 pounds of meat in a sitting to change again. She was already pretty big, but it looked like she could get a lot bigger. It was hard for him to imagine, but despite her formidable size, the lions he’d seen at the zoo were still a great deal bigger than her. Just another reason not to change her any more after this… so long as this worked.<br />
<br />
“Just, remember to stay put, alright?” The boy reminded her, putting Alex’s muzzle back on before sitting on the floor beside the lioness’s belly. “…Stay…”<br />
<br />
Alex fidgeted anxiously, but kept still, unable to see what her brother had in mind. In truth, he didn’t have much of a plan for this next part. His hand shakily reaching out to her sister’s stomach, fingers touching that squishy human prick hanging off the lioness’s belly. The lioness kicked in her restraints, stomach arching back as she rumbled a feral grunt. Her penis rocked and flopped around, hardly spurting out a drop of cum before instantly going limp once her brother pulled his fingers back.<br />
<br />
Colin sensed the tension in the air. It was an awkward fog just as heavy as the sweaty, musky smells emanating off Alex’s oily hide. He was going to do more than just masturbate her to get he to change. Just a measly orgasm like that didn’t seem to do much of anything, and Alex kept resisting the whole time. The boy was confident the lioness couldn’t pry her legs from the belt easily, but she was really trying hard…<br />
<br />
“A-Alex…” Colin took a step back, voice growing shaky as he realized this task was going to be quite daunting. “What do I do? You keep moving and I can’t get a grip on your penis.”<br />
<br />
“RRRrrr-j-just…” The lioness flashed a ferocious eye at her little brother, she seemed agitated all over again just from him touching her for a few seconds!<br />
<br />
“…J-just something!” She wailed, girlish voice stretching to a deep tone in her huge bestial throat. “J-just bite it, kick it, squeeze it! Just make it gone, do it!”<br />
<br />
Her tone was frantic. Alex was really dealing with a ticking time bomb. He made sure the phone was close by just in case he needed to quickly change her back before resorting to what she asked!<br />
<br />
His fists pounded on Alex’s taut belly. Her bounced like a drum as her flaccid wiener smooshed flat against her stomach. Colin punched it again, watching Alex’s pathetic-looking human dick spurting out a much larger gush of water goop than before! He banged on before wrapping it in a fist, squeezing and tugging it as glue-like spunk webbed around his hands and her cock!<br />
<br />
Alex’s body flared, her heat starting to sizzle Colin’s skin as the smaller human tried to get her off! She babbled inhumanly. Growls intertwined with terrifyingly aggressive purrs that reverberated through her penis as the boy felt it quiver, suddenly shrinking little by little in his palm. Just as it seemed Colin was getting somewhere, a burst of splintering wood cracked against the boy’s ear drums!<br />
<br />
“Crreiiick!”<br />
<br />
The boy feared it was one of his limbs at first, but then he saw Alex’s dresser that he had attached a bungie cord to topple over. The lioness’s muscular haunches ripped the leg right off the dresser, sending socks and underwear careening off the top, littering the floor around them as Alex writher and rolled around unfettered!<br />
<br />
Colin made for the phone but couldn’t find it in the chaos of underwear and flailing lioness! He barely rolled underneath the bed before the lioness’s belly slammed into it, his beast of a sister panting with deep, drool-slickened huffs underneath that plastic muzzle as she eyed Colin like a predator.<br />
<br />
“Do it!” Her harsh leonine voice snarled out like thunder, the bridge of hew nose sneering “rrrrr… Morrrrre!”<br />
<br />
“Stop! Stay! Stay!” Colin’s voice squeaked, holding out a hand to order his sister to stand down like a dog.<br />
<br />
“RRRrrrr… You aren’t done yet.” Alex growled, sounding like a stalling motorcycle engine as she rolled her stomach upwards. She was desperate and it was clear why. Her penis had indeed shrunken in the last couple of seconds, her cock hidden underneath her loose foreskin, “Finish it! DO IT!”<br />
<br />
“No, you’re too movey!” Colin whimpered back, curling up into a ball under the bed. “This isn’t working, you’re gonna squish me!”<br />
<br />
“RRRrrr…” Her eyelids shut for a moment before violently splaying open, “Just FUCK IT! STICK YOU DICK IN IT AND FUCK IT!”<br />
<br />
Alex thrashed her tummy against the bed, muscular limb rippling at the two restraints still binding her paws to one another, trapping them in those oven mitts. She was really going crazy and just wasn’t listening anymore! She would have to change back, now!<br />
<br />
The boy frantically searched for the phone as he heard leather stretching, peering up for just a moment at her forepaws bound above her head as he saw the belt discolor and distend!<br />
<br />
The phone wasn’t anywhere to be found. She was either laying on it or one of them pushed it away in all the chaos. There was no stopping her, he didn’t have a choice!<br />
<br />
Colin gulped before tugging his pants down before army-crawling as fast as he could from underneath the bed, hugging onto Alex’s stomach before she had the chance to crush him. For some ungodly reason all the panic had made his cock diamond-hard, Colin hastily using his hands to press the lioness’s and his cocks together as he led his dick into her foreskin, shoving it as hard as he could inside her!<br />
<br />
He expected her to roar! He expected her to break every bone in his body, but… she stopped out of nowhere. As soon as she felt her brother’s cock dock with hers, her body relaxed, sharp muscles disappearing as her bare hide turned soft as a kitten’s. Her terrible growling lessened into a guttural purr as Alex began to pant with deep, heavy breaths like a molly cat in heat. A glaze of oily sweat glistened along her belly, moisture steaming off her as Colin held onto her belly for dear life, amazed by the feeling of penetrating someone for the first time.<br />
<br />
Alex’s dick sputtered out hot dollops of seed onto Colin’s as the glans started to plump inside her foreskin. The boy’s penis got locked inside her hot prison of flesh as her anatomy suddenly jerked downwards, her penis traveling down between her legs. Just as it started, Alex rolled onto her back, bringing her brother with her. She suspended him on top of her huge frame as the boy began sliding down her slick belly in unison with her dick. Her feline teats bumped against his chest as he glid across her, the little mounds of lion mammaries feeling much more swollen than they had before, small black nipples peeking out from her belly as Colin’s legs sunk in between Alex’s muscular, leonine thighs.<br />
<br />
His dick felt like it was on fire, Alex’s scorching feline heat searing his wiener in her oven of a body as he slipped between her tied up hindlegs, Alex’s cum gushing all over the boy’s groin as her penis started to shift. Within moments his feet were planted on the ground behind his sister, and around his cock, he felt that tube of Alex’s foreskin suddenly bifurcate into two flaps. The pressure didn’t dissipate at all though, the lioness’s grip on Colin’s cock growing hotter and tighter as those lips evolved, inflating into lush, pillowy mounds of labia, squashing the boy’s penis right in the center. The gooey splurts of Alex’s seed grew more watery, copious splashes of hot girl juices taking its place as the lioness’s legs flexed around her brother’s chest, holding him tightly in place.<br />
<br />
Colin was getting woozy just standing behind her, the heat radiating from her body rapidly escalating as what remained of the lioness’s cock sank into the deep confines of a growing birth canal. Her swollen cock tip thrummed with sizzling-hot wetness as it merged with her labia, forming her new feline clit.<br />
<br />
Colin sunk down on his sister’s lower belly. He looked up at her, spotting Alex’s gaze fixed on him. Her tongue lolled out inside her muzzle as she drooled, peering at him sheer lust in her eyes. He was the only male around, and she really really needed one of those now.<br />
<br />
With his head pressed against her stomach, he could her insides squish and gurgle around, organs squelching to the side as her birth canal bore deep into her tummy. Alex’s skin started to pull tight, her lower belly inflating outwards against his cheek as a huge leonine womb pressed the lengths of her intestines aside to make room for her ovaries. New animal hormones flowed through her blood, pacifying her as her swollen feline cunt hugged Colin’s dick with every heaving breath she took, urging the boy started to start to mate with her. And he did.<br />
<br />
It was involuntary at first, the boy’s body just naturally wanting to smoosh his dick into a warm female. Was it safe? It was impossible to tell, anything at any moment might set Alex off like it had done before… but somehow Colin just knew she was different this time.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t fighting him at all, her face absolved of all that angst Alex had always carried with her, the pain that used to weigh in her eyes washed away. She looked like a new person, rather, a new animal, even her oily sweat adopting the same, stinking-sweetness of her pussy juices, the numbingly powerful promise of pleasure bubbling up from within.<br />
<br />
He sunk his fingers against her thick feline sides and pushed forward, awkwardly mashing his crotch against her in uneven fits as more of that near-boiling lioness lube leaked, drenching his balls. Colin started to pant just as much as the lioness was, his T-shirt soaked with Alex’s sweat as his anxious thrusting began to build confidence.<br />
<br />
As he picked up the pace, his plowing into her still lacked any grace. He was lopsided on top of her, and even worse, her pussy kept growing around his dick, her vaginal innards undulating around him, expanding over and over before contracting tight around him once again.<br />
<br />
Despite all the flaws, Alex was in bliss. Her eyes kept gazing into his, the lioness’s head occasionally rocking back in throws of pleasure as her pinkish flesh shuddered beneath him. Her brother’s penis was more than enough for her even though it wasn’t the size of male lion’s. Every inch of her new vagina was so plump and sensitive it felt like he was pounding away at her cervix even though his cock barely sank a few inches passed her entrance. Her sopping-wet clit kissed against Colin’s balls as he hilted inside her, beast and boy flesh embracing as the two consecrated her new form.<br />
<br />
In that swamp of feral cunt, a virgin like Colin was doomed to burst before the sex really even began. In the worst anticlimax of his life, the boy let loose, his cock blasting out all its sperm against the rim of her clit as Alex’s muscular walls continued to massage her brother’s softening dick. He felt bad, realizing that Alex hadn’t had his own orgasm yet, but it didn’t seem to bother the lioness. She kept her thighs cozily tight aground Colin’s chest, her cunt slurping around his noodle of a dick as it slowly retracted and slipped free. Once he was loose, Alex let her brother go, the boy toppling on the floor behind as he tried to stand, barely able to pick himself up as he turned to look at the mess they had made.<br />
<br />
The room was in shambles. Furniture was broken and clothes were strewn everywhere, but that was nothing compared to the puddle of lioness cum steaming over top the carpet. It marked everything it touched with a harsh, fishy smell, Colin fearing no pet deodorizer stood a chance at getting it all out!<br />
<br />
The bound-up Alex was still on cloud-nine, not bothering to return to reality as she savored the sensations of finally being a female. She twitched and purred as her tail whipped against her vagina, the sensation enough to make her squirt through her puffy lips, more than eager to add to the puddle that desolated her bedroom! <br />
<br />
“Hey.” Alex’s voice finally spoke out, the violent roaring from a few minutes ago a distant memory as her tone sounded even more tender than before – just like Nadia’s from The Lion Prince. “I think I’m good now. Can you let me go?”<br />
<br />
Colin had learned his lesson time and time again in the last few hours that Alex couldn’t handle herself as an animal, but still… she just seemed different somehow. At the risk of his own life, the boy simply agreed, unhooking the bungie cords and unfastening the belt, stepping up right in front of the lioness as he undid Queenie’s muzzle, setting her free.<br />
<br />
Alex’s snout greeted him with an anthropomorphic smile, a calm blue shining in her wide felid eyes as she advanced forward, nuzzling her head against her brother’s groin.<br />
<br />
“We did it.” Alex purred, her tail arched tail swaying back and forth behind her as she got up, juices dripping from her rear end. Before Colin could get a word in, Alex nipped at his shirt and tugged him up onto her bed in a blur of motion. As her brother bounced against the mattress, Alex was close behind, her dinner-plate sized paws wrapping around Colin, spooning him against her feral form.<br />
<br />
The mattress springs creaked like they were crying out in pain, but the lioness didn’t pay them any mind. Alex was lost in the moment, not caring about what came before or what was going to come ahead. She was in heaven right then and there.<br />
<br />
“Sorry I couldn’t… do very well.” Colin sighed, finally getting out that apology he’d been holding in for the bad sex. “I guess you’d need a real lion to give you the real experience, huh.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it was my first time too.” Alex purred cheerily, “But another lion, huh? Do you mean I should head off to a zoo? I guess if you couldn’t get me to Africa, I wouldn’t mind that!”<br />
<br />
She arched her head down, lapping at Colin’s scalp with her big scratchy tongue. “Or do maybe I just need you. Maybe you can be a lion too and then we can make it right.”<br />
<br />
“Heh.” Colin gulped, “After seeing you change… I don’t think I could stomach-”<br />
<br />
The female interrupted the boy, tugging her brother close, locking him in a tight hug. She kneaded her paws against his back with her vicious claws fortunately sheathed, her plush paw pads massaging his back.<br />
<br />
Colin couldn’t do much other than accept the hug. His face squished against her belly before Alex shifted and mashed him against one of her feral teats. I almost felt like a pillow, his face sinking into that lush bulge of hairless flesh like a leathery water balloon as the lioness eagerly let him explore her new body.<br />
<br />
With his sister’s fiery, fierce feminine musk soaking against his face and and his whole form cradled against her lush body, Colin could finally relax. He was confident that now that Alex got what he wanted, this whole ordeal could finally come to a happy end.<br />
<br />
“Vrrroooo…”<br />
<br />
The sound of a car driving through their cul-de-sac didn’t bother them, and Colin was just slightly stirred as he heard something coming up the driveway. It wasn’t until Alex perked up as she heard the garage door open did time start to flow for the two again.<br />
<br />
“Oh, god, not now!” Colin whimpered as Alex leapt of the bed, “She was supposed to be working all night! Why did mom get home so early?!”<br />
<br />
They hadn’t cleaned anything at all! The bathroom’s floor was still splattered with Alex’s cum, and the door was scarred with giant gashes left from his sister’s claws! And Alex’s room… it looked like a warzone! It’d take a day to make things presentable even if both of them were working on getting it clean.<br />
<br />
Colin prayed he could hide the mess and damage they made so that they had time to repair things. Afterall, one of them had to keep on their mother’s good side! First thing first though, he had to deal with Alex.<br />
<br />
“Alex!” Colin called to his sister, “We need to change you back! Mom’s gonna freak if she sees you like this! Where’s your phone?!”<br />
<br />
The lioness’s placid, post-coital state was over. The floor creaked underneath her heavy body as she darted around the room like a trapped animal, not ready for it all to end, not now! Her snout dug along the floor, flipping over loose articles of clothes and peering under furniture as Colin joined in on the search for her lost phone too. After a half-a-minute of looking, Alex’s head finally bobbing up with that black-rectangle firmly held within her maw.<br />
<br />
“Good! Let me see it!” Colin beckoned her to him, but she wasn’t having it. Her head kept swiveling away from his hands whenever he tried to reach for it, the lion leaping from one side of the room to the other as her body slammed against the room’s walls, Alex desperate not to let her brother change her back into a human male!<br />
<br />
“Alex, you can’t stay a lioness forever!” Colin tried to give her a harsh dose of reality, but she was still fighting it, shaking her head ‘no’ over and over as she tried to delay the inevitable.<br />
<br />
Alex’s ears shifted towards the door as they heard their mom start to walk up the stairs. Hearing the commotion coming from Alex’s room, she was surely going barge in and look at any moment!<br />
<br />
The lioness’s eyes widened, her head frantically peering this way and that, searching for an escape!<br />
<br />
Glass shattered.<br />
<br />
The last thing Colin could remember was Alex’s body torpedoing above him, leaping toward the window behind his back. The glass pane shattered like a cannon ball had whizzed right through it, the big cat making her own exit as she fell two stories down to the lawn below.<br />
<br />
Colin was shaking. He knew she liked being a lioness, but that fall could have killed her!<br />
<br />
The boy’s heart raced as he picked himself off the floor to peer down at the impact site. He expected to see Alex the lioness broken and roaring out in pain, but she wasn’t there. She had landed perfectly on all fours just like any other cat, Colin catching a glimpse of her shiny, furless hide as she sprinted like a cheetah in the dead of night into the dark woods behind their house.</p>
