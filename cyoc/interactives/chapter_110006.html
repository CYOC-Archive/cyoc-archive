<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After closing the door behind you, you have the three girls place the items on the ground and help them sort. You had recieved some high quality armor, a couple of swords, some potions, a few miscellaneous items, and a rather large amount of money. Your face turns red as Sarah sneaks up on you and slams the panties down on your head, making you chase her. After tripping and slamming your face into the wall, you stop. You sit there, laughing your ass off. You calm down and smile as Camille tends to your broken nose, healing it with her magic. You sit there until you hear &quot;Master, may I wear those? My onlt pair got soaked when you sliced the Sorcerer in two.&quot;<br />
<br />
You get back on your feet, facing her. You grab her by the shoulders and look at her in the eye and say &quot;You can do whatever you want, you have no master now.&quot; You tighten your grip on her arms as she passes out, and set her down against the wall. You have Camille tend to her sickness and wounds as you gear up. You take of your battered iron sheets, tossing it aside. You grin in amazement as you lift up a new chestplate. It was Volcanium, an extremely rare ore named after the only land formation in which it is found. It was a dark red, glowing a soft orange here and there. It could withstand extreme heat, even a dragon&#39;s blast. <br />
<br />
You put on the chestplate, leg segments, boots, helmet, gloves, and the skin tight sections between to fully conceal yourself from the blast. You face the girls, and recieve looks of utter amazement as they stared at you. You pick up a longsword that gave off a white glow, and inspect it. It was a three foot length of pure silver, with a magicall enchantment that kept it at the coldest temperature possible. You look at the handle and see a large, round emerald placed in the bottom of the grip. You look at the note attached and read it. &quot;For you, hero. The finest sword we Elves had.&quot; Sarah leans over your shoulder and says &quot;Those Elf girls really want to get laid by you.&quot; You laugh and say &quot;Well, they&#39;re just one of the temptations which I&#39;ve had to deal with here.&quot; You smile behind your helmet as you see Camille&#39;s face turn red. You turn around and head up the stairs, ready to rescue the Princess.<br />
<br />
As you reach the halfway point of the tower, you feel a rumbling and try to keep your balance as the tower shakes. You look out a nearby window and see the ground move down from you a little. &quot;that can&#39;t be possible,&quot; you think, &quot;towers can&#39;t fly!&quot; You run up the stairs and watch as the floor above you is ripped off, flying away and eventually starting to orbit the tower. You look over as you see a figure clad in purple appears, and realize the Princess is watching. Your attention, however, is diverted to the source of a laugh. there, in front of you, is the Sorcerer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really think killing me would be that easy? If you want to duel me, you&#39;ll have to get throuugh my dragon first!&quot; You watch as he vanishes in a puff of somke, only to have a great big, black dragon appear. It lets out a massive roar, spouting green flames. You roll to the side as he swipes at you, missing you by a mere inch. You look at its underbelly and see that it&#39;s covered in loot. &quot;Damn,&quot; you think, &quot;this dragon has obviously been sleeping on his pile of gold.&quot; You dodge another swipe, and run to the dragon&#39;s hind leg. You jump up and grab a scale, climbing your way up. Your armor sizzles as you drag yourself up the dragon&#39;s leg, grabbing one scale after the other.<br />
<br />
You almost get flung off as you climb up the leg, but barely hold on. You finally reach the dragon&#39;s bac and start making your way to its head. You watch as the head turns around like an owl&#39;s and breaths a jet of green flame at you. You stand there, bracing yourself against the flame, trying not to fall off. Afterthe flames stop, you look up at the dragon&#39;s head. it stares at you in what seems like fear. You charge towards the head, yelling the entire way. It bucks you up in the air, and bites down on you.<br />
<br />
For a moments, everything&#39;s dark. Then you hear a roaring and see green flame come from the dragon&#39;s throat. You yell at it as you feel the most intense heat ever, all the while you smash your magical ice sword against its face. You feel the sword enter something soft, and your ears are almost blown out by the roar. the dragon spits you out, and you look up. You watch as it thrashes around, green blood leaking from its eye. You stand up and lunge at the other eye, only to be knocked away by a claw. You slide along the ground, sending sparks flying as you grind across it. You stop right before the edge, and get a good look at the ground.<br />
<br />
The tower is floating about a mile above the castle, and you see large crowds in and around it, watching and waiting. You look back at the dragon as you hear a thumping, and feel a heavy claw against your legs. You stare in fear into the dragon&#39;s one good eye, bracing yourself for the long fall down as you feel it nudge you towards the edge. But it never happens. Confused, you look up. The dragon had turned its head around, and was staring at a figure by its tail. You look at the figure, and realize it is Sarah, beating it with that frying pan she got in the kitchen. As the dragon turns around to attack her, you get up and run towards it.<br />
<br />
You jump up and grab its bad eye, pulling yourself up. You hold onto its head as you plunge your sword through the skull, scewering the brain. It lets out one last roar before going limp and dissolving into smoke, leaving behind its gold. You turn to thank Sarah but are immediately knocked to the ground. You look up and see the Sorcerer standing in front of you. You quickly stand up, but are punched through your armor by some kind of hand. You grunt in pain and place your hands on your abdomen, feeling the armor is intact. You grimace and stare at the Sorcerer with contempt in your eyes.<br />
<br />
The Sorcerer laughs, and lets you get back up. He tosses your sword at you and you catch it, holding it in a defensive stance. He pull the top of his sstaff off, revealing a long blade. He throws the case off to the side, and points his sword at you. &quot;May the best man win&quot;, he says. You smile and lunge at him.<br />
<br />
You slam your sword down on his and frown as he holds you back. He quickly takes his sword and back wahcks you in the head, disorienting you. You shake your head and swing at him, your blade colliding with his hand. He screams in agony as he drops the sword, and cradles his hand. He looks at you and holds up his good hand. He shouts &quot;Flamza!&quot; You just stand there as you see the flame come towards you. You regret standing still, however, as you are engulfed in flames. You&#39;re reminded the hard way that magic fire burns hot enough to hurt a person who&#39;s wearing Volcanium.<br />
<br />
You power through it, though as you slowly march forwards. You reach him as the flames begin to thin out, and are standing in front of him once he finishes. You stare down at him in anger as he stares up at you in fear. You raise your sword and say &quot;Prepare to meet your maker.&quot; You stab your sword down, sending the sword down his spine. As soon as you kill him, a large boom is heard. The tower slowly descends back down to its place, and the top of the tower lands on it. You lookk towards the last remaining stairs and walk up them.<br />
<br />
You reach the top of the stairway and look around. You see a bed, a dresser, a mirror, a few chairs with a table, and a desk wiht books piled high around it. You look at the balcony and see her standing there. From the back she is gorgeous. A purple dress that forms perfectly to her large rear, with a slit on each side that starts at her hip and continues down, revealing her long and sexy legs. Her hair is a bright blonde, tumbling down her back until it barey rests on her back end. As you step across the room, she turns around.<br />
<br />
You stop midstep as you see her heavenly face. Green eyes, luscious lips, long lashes, small nose. She looke a few inches shorter than you. You look down at her chest, and are given a wonderful surprise. Her breasts must have been at least the size of watermelons, for they were large. You take the last few steps into the sunlight. She gasps and places her hands over her heart, smiling. She says &quot;My hero!&quot; You get down on one knee and take hold of ler left hand. It was so dainty and smooth looking. You remove your helmet and give it a gentle kiss, making her blush. As you stand up, she embraces you, holding on tightly.<br />
<br />
You hold her back, and you both stare out at the land beyond. &quot;Soon&quot;, she says. You look down at her and say &quot;Soon what?&quot; She looks back up and says &quot;Soon, we&#39;ll be King and Queen.&quot; You smile at the thought. You watch as she walks over to her bed, and sits down on it, spreading her legs. Seeing where this is going, you take off your armor and place it by the stairs. You get on the bed with her and whip it out.<br />
<br />
Seeing your foot long manhood, she gasps. She looks up at you and says &quot;This is truly your greatest weapon, hero! Hopefully you have saved yourself for me, as I have done for you.&quot; You smile at her and say &quot;Indeed I have.&quot; You take your clothes off as she slips her dress off, and you begin to fuck.<br />
<br />
She grabs your dick and starts rubbing it, making you hard. She eyes your dick with glee, and begins to suck it. &quot;Damn,&quot; you say, &quot;you&#39;re good at this.&quot; She moves her head back and forth, sucking you like a vacuum. You moan in pleasure as she takes your load, and then flip her over. You stick your dick between her massive buttcheeks, and begin to pound her. She screams &quot;HARDER! HARDER!&quot; as you pound her, filling her with your meat. You grab her tits, feeling those massive mammaries in your hands. You feel around her nipples, causing her to tremble with ecstasy. You keep pounding her while feeling her tits until you cum in her ass, making both of you scream in joy.<br />
<br />
You flip her over and stick your dick in her vagina. She grabs onto you as you psuh, trying to get all twelve inches of your cock inside. She screams &quot;HARDER! DONT STOP!  FUCK ME!&quot; You continue to pound her, and eventually cum. You both stop after that, with you laying on top of her with your dick still in her. She smiles and says &quot;Wow.&quot; You nod your head in response, both of you lying there.</p>
