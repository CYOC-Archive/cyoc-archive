<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day&#39;s turned into weeks, turned into months. The Countess never did find a new wet nurse for Brook and she remained under Jasper&#39;s care. The former Lord Lake was thriving on Jasper&#39;s milk as were Pyotr and Bry. Perhaps this was part of the reason that Jasper was in the Countess&#39;s good books once more. <br />
<br />
Twice in the last month she had been invited around to the Countess&#39;s town house, a splendid mansion on two acres adjacent to the keep, for afternoon tea. The only proviso was that she bought Lady Brook with her. On both occasions Penelope had opted not to accompany &quot;Lady Jasmine&quot; as she referred to Jasper to the Countess&#39;s abode. Penelope was no fan of the Countess. She detested the woman who had changed her status from a Lady into a servant. She opted instead to stay at the Muscat&#39;s house and care for Pyotr and Bry. Jasper had learnt how to pump her breast milk into a bladder, essentially milking herself. By doing this Penelope could feed the babies in Jasper&#39;s absence and Jasper had no need to hurry home.<br />
<br />
At the first afternoon tea Jasper had turned up in her wet nurse uniform. The countess was shocked. She had seen &quot;Jasmine&quot; many times in her uniform at the Muscat residence but as the Countess explained &#39;I do not invite servants around to afternoon tea. You are soon to be raised to nobilty and I sent the invitation to you on the assumption that you would arrive dressed appropriately for you new station in life&#39; &quot;Jasmine&quot; was immediately sent upstairs to the Countess&#39;s chambers where one of the maids had been ordered to find clothing more appropriate for &quot;Lady Jasmine&quot;. When Jasper returned to the the parlour, she was wearing a Mantua dress of the latest fashion, hoops included. The Countess was pleased. Jasper felt very self conscious walking home as she pushed Brook in the baby carriage.<br />
<br />
The Countess enjoyed cuddling her granddaughter and she confessed to &quot;Jasmine&quot; &#39;She is the only family I have left&#39; The older woman was in despair, that no ransom demand for her son had ever come. Jasper did not have the heart to tell her that one never would. It was a secret only known to Jasper, that the missing Lord Lake had been transformed into the infant &quot;Lady Brook&quot;<br />
<br />
On the third such invitation to the Countess&#39;s town house Jasper made a mistake. Penelope was brushing Jasper&#39;s hair, whilst getting her Mistress ready for her visit. Jasper had been careless and had not dyed the roots of her hair for over a month. Penelope spied red roots under her mistress&#39;s long dark locks, a red even darker than her own.<br />
<br />
&#39;Lady Jasmine? Why do you dye your hair?&#39; <br />
<br />
Jasper knew immediately of her mistake &#39;You have seen my roots?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes they are showing. They are deep red, royal red. So is it true? Are you really a royal Princess in disguise?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Who has told you that?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Betsy thinks you are. She says you are of royal bearing and too learned to be a mere servant. And Mistress Patricia is very deferential to you&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I can assure you I am not a royal princess in disguise. (that at least was technically true). Yes I have red hair. Master Simon had me dye it when we fled the capitol so we would not be questioned by the soldiers at every checkpoint. It has been more convenient to just stay this way and not bring attention to myself&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Sir Richard will be pleasantly surprised when he finds out. He will be even more in love with you&#39;. Jasper blushed. Weekly she received letters from her betrothed who was now fighting on the front lines. In them Richard always spoke of his undying love for &quot;My soulmate&quot;. It was pathetically sickening but to Penelope it was so romantic.<br />
<br />
Jasper shared the letters with Penelope as they were the sole source of news about the progress of the war. As Penelope had spent many summers in the Eastern Hill&#39;s where her family had owned several Estates including Featherstone, she could inform Jasper where the towns Richard was writing from were and exactly how close to Wind&#39;s Grove the rebel army was. The rebels appeared to be advancing. Jasper had been to Wind&#39;s Grove himself on several occasions, but both times it had been with a hunting party and the then Crown Prince had paid little attention to anything but the hunting and the local girls.<br />
<br />
&#39;I would ask that you keep my natural hair colour a secret. Not even Richard is to know. I will keep it a surprise until we are wed&#39; As far as Jasper was concerned that was forever.<br />
<br />
After lunch Jasper and Brook attended the Countess&#39;s afternoon tea. &quot;Jasmine&quot; showing up dressed as a Lady once more wearing the Mantua dress. This time she didn&#39;t have to push the baby carriage, the Countess sent her town carriage around to pick up Jasmine. Evidently ladies should not be seen pushing carriages through town. Jasper went with the flow.<br />
<br />
Whilst at tea. The Countess brokered the latest news. &#39;Have you heard from Sir Richard? I believe he will be in town in the next week&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No. I have not heard that news. Where did you hear this?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;A letter arrived today. The new Duke is to be announced. He will be arriving in the near future. I believe Richard is attached to his staff. The title is to be bestowed in a week&#39;s time at the keep&#39; That made some sense as there had been a lot of work happening at the keep in the last month. Rumours were that a new Duke was to move in.<br />
<br />
Jasmine received a letter from Richard the next day. &quot;Joy oh joy my beloved. I write this with good news.I must be brief as we leave immediately. I will enjoy a furlough in Vingery with my commander who is to be made the new Duke. I hope to see you in about 14 days. Prepare yourself to attend the investing ceremony on the last Sunday of the month. Your golden gown will be perfect. P.S. I believe it may be a double celebration as rumours are a wedding may also take place. Your beloved, Richard&#39;  The letter was dated from 10 days past.<br />
<br />
Poor Penelope was in tears after reading the letter. She was the daughter of the late Duke and the Keep had been her home. Jasper had to console her.</p>
