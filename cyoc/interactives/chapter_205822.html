<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor the Chameleon Boy having had made his way back to his mom and brother, Noah was asking Taylor all kinds of questions like are you actually a lizard now? Taylor answered haha yes!  Hunched over a little bit because of his arch spine and his tail Taylor breathing kind of heavy still getting used to his new body. Held his moms hand as they were leaving the park. His mom not really knowing what to say to him in this form. As soon as they left through the parks entrance. Taylor said that he felt a little weird. His vision became very dark. Not being able to see as well as he could. His mom letting go to look at her son. Noah watched as Taylor reach up to his head actually pull it off revealing his normal 12 year old self. He looked at his body which still look like a chameleon. However he pulled at his neck showing that it was actually just a skin tight jumpsuit with an attached tail and spine. Underneath jumpsuit he saw the he still had his original clothes from before still on. And his hands and feet had gloves and shoe covers. Arriving at their car Taylor finally started to take off the rest of the costume. Folding up the jumpsuit and stuffing it into the head along with the other accessories. The group arrived home got ready for bed. Taylor’s mom and brother went straight up to bed. His mom letting him stay up a little bit long to finish his episode of TV. As he was watching it, they had left the front sore cracked open as small grasshopper had made its way into the living room where Taylor was sitting. As if by second nature his right eye without moving his left eye, looks to the right and see the grasshopper. Crawling a little bit closer, Taylor arched his back and in one swift motion his tong shot out of his mouth snatching up the insect right up into his mouth eating it whole. Taylor giggled as he seemed to have kept some of his chameleon traits even after he turned back into a normal boy. <br />
Ava Conner’s girlfriend was concerned when he walked back over and wasn’t talking the same way he used to. Only speaking when spoken to his voice still sounded the same but it was very monotone. Conner looked over at her, his optics highlighting where a label popped up above her head that read “In emotional distress”. Seeing this Conner’s torso rotated 90 degrees to the left. His arms stretched and circled around her. Conner then said to her in his monotone voice “it is ok, I am still here”. Pulling one arm back he reached around his other two friends. The all got up and made their way to the exit walking out of the gate. Conner stumbled backward his friend mason catching him. They asked what was wrong   Conner replied with something feels wrong. As he reached up to his head he was able to remove the helmet. Ava saw this and ran over to kiss him. Liam and Mason confused thinking that Conner had actually turned into a robot forever. Conner explained that he thought he was. He next removed the boxy outer casing of the suit leaving him only in a thick gray jumpsuit. Peaking underneath the jumpsuit he saw that his clothes from before were still there. They arrived back at the car, Conner took the rest of the robot suit off folding it up and placing it into the trunk of the car. Mason dropped Ava and Conner off back at Conner’s house. They stayed up to watch and movie. Ava asked if she could have some chips. Conner put his right hand out as it stretched and grabbed the chips. He then continued to watch the movie how ever his eyes were able to zoom in a little bit and activates subtitles for him self to watch. <br />

Danny skipped back to his older brother. Trevor looked his younger brother up and down. In aw at the quality of the costume he was sure they put him in was such high quality. Trevor was tell Danny about how he wanted to check on some of the games to see if his friend Barry was here working.  Skipping along with him Danny was looking around all over the place at all of the people. After following his brother around more Trevor couldn’t find Barry. This confused him since he thought he was working tonight. Leaving through the main entrance Danny’s eye sight became very dark removing the tight bird mask from his face. Along with the feathery wig he was wearing. Looking down at himself he was wearing a shirt with blue feathers all the way up to the base of his head. The shirt even went all the way down and covered up his hands which made them look like wings. Picking up his feet he saw that he was wearing black tights, and slippers that looked like bird feet. Walking home Danny realized that it seemed more comfortable skip while he was wearing the  bird feet. Arriving at home Danny went up into his room took off the rest of the costume he put it up in his room. That night he was bringing the trash can back from the street. When he saw and acorn on the ground he picked it up. And using his nose he pecked at it until it opened up and hate the insides. Seeing a tree branch he jumped up into the air and flapped his arms and landed on the branch jumping down he was amazed that he was able to still fly like a blue Jay.</p>
