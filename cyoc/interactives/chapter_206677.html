<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a new video game, a PS5 model with a physical media input and along with it was a game disc that you had never heard of before called &quot;X-Earth&quot;. You took the console to your room and connected it to your TV.  When you turned it on you found that there was already an account registered in your name, whoever sent the console was definitely for you. You then decided to try out the unknown game that came with it, so you installed it and sat on your bed with the controller in hand. There was a clip that showed footage from the game before the splash screen showed what promised to be an ultra realistic graphic of the game.  Once you can finally choose to start a new game the first thing you had to do was create your character.<br />
<br />
You created for yourself a female character with ample breasts and an extremely revealing outfit.  She went anime style with wavy blue hair going down to her shoulders and you found the option to include some animal ears and tail, and you put the cat ones on your character. To match the look you named her Katty.<br />
<br />
After confirming the character customization, the screen went black for a few seconds and then a dark room was shown where a very old was lit only by candlelight on a table.<br />
<br />
The witch turned straight to the screen and said &quot;Well, what do we have here?  It has arrived at the perfect time.  I&#39;m sorry for what I&#39;m going to do, later you&#39;ll understand better, but right now I don&#39;t have time to explain.&quot; She then holds up an open free in front of her with one hand and recites a few words in a language you were not able to recognize, thus forming a ball of light in her free hand.  When she was done she hurled the ball of light towards the screen.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t have time to react to what happened next, the ball of light came out of the TV screen and hit you right in your chest and the light spread and everything went so white you couldn&#39;t see anything else.  When the white dissipated it was replaced by complete darkness and only then did you realize you could no longer feel your body.<br />
<br />
You stayed in this limbo for a few minutes until you finally felt your body again and realized that you were lying under the covers in your bed. You think it was all a dream and you just woke up. You rub your eyes as you sit up in bed, but the heaviness in your chest is strange.  You then open your eyes and realize that you were not in your room, but in what appeared to be a small, single-room log cabin.<br />
<br />
Next you turned your attention to the heaviness in your chest and discovered that you had a pair of large breasts and were wearing very familiar clothes. You then ran to a mirror hanging on the wall beside the bed and looked into it, seeing that you were Katty now. You then ran to look out the cabin window just to say that you were in the game world, on X-Earth.<br />
<br />
You started looking around the hut for any clues as to what had happened and realize that you are now in the same hut as the witch who appeared in the game after recognizing the table with the unlit candle on it, of which there was a scroll next to it.<br />
<br />
You took the parchment written in a foreign language, which you were surprised to be able to understand, and read: &quot;To anyone reading this, I once again apologize.  My name was Cleo and to understand why the &#39;was&#39; just keep reading. You now find yourself in X-Earth, a world parallel to your own.  In this world magic is highly developed and its use common.  I used on you one that can only be used once in a lifetime, which is when you are on the verge of death from natural causes. Under the effect of this spell I actually steal the body of someone young in another world and live in their place, but in exchange the person who has their body stolen, in which case is you, are transported to X-Earth where you get a new body to your liking, taking my place in the world and being able to live under a new identity. The spell also allows us to understand each other&#39;s native language after the swap. All I can do now is wish you happy X-Earth, for this spell cannot be undone, and for you to start with nothing my cabin and all my belongings are now yours. PS: You might be wondering how you ended up contacting me on X-Earth, right?  I can&#39;t say for sure since I&#39;ve never been in your world before and didn&#39;t know anything until I wrote this note.  All I know is that even after we go to the other world we can still use our magic and so someone who has passed can choose a body to be &#39;stolen&#39; by someone they know who can transition some time later, so i believe that someone I knew in the past chose you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finishing reading the parchment, you were forced to accept that you were now the girl you had created and that you would have to live as such. Since the cabin you were in and its contents belonged to you now, you explored it to learn more about your new possessions. Among your new belongings you found a shelf containing books of magic, which you leafed through and noticed that there were several types of magic, each with its purpose, having medicinal, domestic, elemental and more.  You, however, became more interested in a specific category of magic, one that, due to the amount of books on the subject, the former owner was also very interested in, were the transformation magics that allowed you to change both your own body and that of another person in many different ways. <br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently I&#39;m going to enjoy living on X-Earth.&quot; You told yourself.</p>
