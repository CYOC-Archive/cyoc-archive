<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron lay on his bed in his room, only wearing a pair of boxer shorts as he played video games. He should probably get some of his college work done, but it was Saturday and he was absorbed in watching the slow changes occurring to his body. Muscle had continued its slow growth, nothing like his father sported, instead he was lean and trim like a runner or a swimmer, but who knew what might happen? An hour ago he had noticed some fine blond hairs growing between his pecs, and his cock had continued to grow as well, a rather respectable six inches now. There was still well over a day on the clock and he felt like a different person. Well, looked. He still felt mostly like himself.<br />
<br />
He had his headset on, chatting with his best friend Jake as they played together. Jake had been a friend from high school, he had a lot of Aaron&#39;s interests, games, sci-fi, same taste in guys. Except Jake was a little bit of a jock, having been on the swim team all through high school and keeping it up even now. They had even tried dating at one point but just weren&#39;t compatible. Though a strange thought drifted through Aaron&#39;s head. He had been on the swim team with Jake, too. He never had been, but memories of it were seeping in. He certainly didn&#39;t get a body like he was sporting just laying around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Behind you.&quot; Came Jake&#39;s voice over the head set, pulling him out of his contemplation.<br />
<br />
Aaron turned his character about a shotgunned the zombie running up on him. But two more were on him and took him out. &quot;Damn it..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay man? You seem distracted. You normally play better than this.&quot; Jake continued on as Aaron waited for his respawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just... thinking about the paper I have to write by Thursday. No big.&quot; Aaron felt bad lying, but he had set the world to not be aware of the changes, so confiding in Jake was out of the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. The Lit 101 assignment? It&#39;s not that bad, I can come over an help you with it tomorrow if you need.&quot; Jake went to the same college as well, but had elected to live in the dorms rather than off campus. He liked an excuse to get out of there when he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. I&#39;ll let you know.&quot; Aaron knew he sounded off, and not just because his voice was slightly deeper than it had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you need is to get laid.&quot; Jake said confidently, Aaron&#39;s cock twitched a little just at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like it&#39;s that easy.&quot; Aaron retorted, reaching down to grab his cock in one hand, giving it a firm squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;For you it could be. If I had a single, hot roommate like you did I&#39;d have been all over him by now.&quot; Jake laughed. &quot;Fuck man, I would have begged him for it by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roommate? You mean Da...ve?&quot; Aaron wanted to say dad, but he seemed to auto-correct himself to his name without thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have any other roommates?&quot; Jake joked. &quot;Dude&#39;s totally into guys. Trust me, I can tell. Too bad that friend of his is so painfully straight or we&#39;d both have it made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron wanted to protest, maybe to argue. The memories of Dave being his dad were still there, but they were being slowly replaced by new memories. Memories that told him there was no way Dave was his dad or could even be his dad. A memory of deciding to move out when he went to college, looking for a place with a roommate and finding this place. Growing up in a slightly different apartment. Another dad, still single from a wife that left them, still a large, burly man, but slightly different, a mechanic not a trainer. The same sort of relationship he had had with Dave as his father, respectful, but cold and distant, not really sharing interests or spending time together.<br />
<br />
Aaron shook his head in an effort to clear it. &quot;You there, A?&quot; He blinked and looked at the screen, noticing he had respawned, but his mind was pulling apart right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think I&#39;m going to hop off. I&#39;ll catch you tomorrow.&quot;  Aaron only just waited for Jake&#39;s goodbyes before turning off the game. Peeling off his headset he heard sounds coming from out in the apartment. Dave must be home. He quickly pulled on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. Even his clothes had been keeping up and able to fit him. Sure the shirt was a bit tight, but more to show off his physique than because it was too small. He headed out of his room, running a hand through shaggy blond hair.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
Luckily Dave&#39;s last two sessions weren&#39;t nearly as awkward as the first two, both going down without incident. Though near the end of his shift he got a message asking him to fill in again tomorrow, Marcus still needing another day. He sent back a confirmation with a heavy sigh as he pushed his way out of the gym and into the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad news?&quot; Came Chris&#39; rather chipper tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just another shift to cover.&quot; He gave the young trainer an odd stare. Chris had never really talked to him before, not unless he needed him for something and today the guy had been acting like they were old friends. Except, something inside Dave said they had been friends for a long time. Some sort of faint, half-formed memory he couldn&#39;t pin down.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what happens when you&#39;re the responsible one.&quot; Chris chuckled. &quot;Wanna go grab some beers before heading home?&quot; Asked like he had asked dozens of times before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tonight. I think I&#39;m going to head home. Been a long day.&quot; Dave shoved his phone back into his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should put the moves on that roommate of yours.&quot; Chris said seriously. &quot;He&#39;s totally into you. I can tell these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron?! But he&#39;s..&quot; Dave tried to say &#39;my son&#39;, but instead spurted out, &quot;so young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is he? Eighteen? Nineteen? My parents have more age difference than you two. Stop being a prude and maybe you won&#39;t need to get blowjobs from random clients in the supply closet.&quot; Chris slapped Dave on the shoulder then headed off to his car.<br />
<br />
Dave scratched the stubble on his jaw. He needed to shave again. Ever since he hit 16 he&#39;d had to shave twice a day just to keep the stubble off. But something told him he did it less often now than he had. A certain comment overheard from Aaron about liking guys with facial hair. He smacked his hand into the side of his head to clear it. Aaron was his son, not some.. He grumbled and headed for his car.<br />
<br />
Sliding in he pulled down the visor. The dark eyes staring back at him were bright. The fine lines that had formed at the corner of his eyes were gone, his brows were dark and heavy. What was happening to him? He drove home in silence, trying to figure things out.<br />
<br />
When he got back to the apartment he practically threw himself down on the couch. He could hear Aaron&#39;s voice, or something close to his voice coming from his bedroom. Probably on a game with Jake if he knew him, and he was sure he did. He grabbed the remote and started flicking through channels, looking for one of the games like he normally watched after he got home, but something else caught his eye.<br />
<br />
It took him a few minutes to recognize the movie, one of Aaron&#39;s favorites, some sci-fi thing he had once tried to get him to watch. That sort of movie had never been his thing but this time he found himself being pulled in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is a good one.&quot; It was Aaron&#39;s voice, maybe a touch deeper but recognizable. Dave turned and almost gave a start as he saw his son. The face was still Aaron, though perhaps a bit more masculine, his features a little sharper, more of a jaw, but still with those high cheek bones and large blue eyes. But the body, he was taller, probably close to Dave&#39;s own height, and the tee he wore clearly showed of a pair of chest muscles and a lean stomach with some abs as well.<br />
<br />
Aaron met his gaze and there was an instant where he thought he might not be the only one in the world noticing something off. But Aaron said nothing, instead just coming to sit next to him on the sofa. &quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave shook his head.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
It had taken every ounce of self control Aaron had not to give a start when he saw Dave. No wonder his memories no longer had  him as his father. He was in his early 30s, at most, that thick jaw scruff and heavily muscled body maybe making him look older than he was. And if he was that much younger already, how much more younger would he get.<br />
<br />
There was something off about him though. Aaron had seen pictures of his father from before he was born and while he looked similar there was just something off he couldn&#39;t put his finger on. Not unfamiliar though. Aaron had never really seen his dad in his prime, but now he could tell why he had those prized body building trophies in the display case in the corner of the room. He was a solid mass of bulky muscle, arms still thicker than some guy&#39;s legs and a chest that stuck out, firm and round.<br />
<br />
As they watched the movie in comfortable silence, Aaron found himself leaning in, resting up against Dave&#39;s side, head on shoulder and chest. He felt one of those thick, powerful arms wrapping around his shoulders protectively. Aaron looked up to see Dave looking down at him, and then they were kissing. There was nothing familial in that, they were going at it like two men starved for romance and each wanting the other.<br />
<br />
Dave picked Aaron up in those arms of his and took him back to his bedroom. Neither of them were thinking now, just acting on instinct and want. Clothes were removed along the way and Aaron found himself looking up at Dave, tracing those powerful muscles with his eyes, wanting to run his fingers through that thick, short chest fur. And then Dave stopped. &quot;I&#39;m.. I..&quot; Aaron reached up to wrap an arm around Dave&#39;s thick neck and pull him down into another kiss.<br />
<br />
Soon their bodies were pressed together, cocks held together in one of Dave&#39;s large hands as he stroked them both off, mouths eagerly exploring each other&#39;s bodies.</p>
