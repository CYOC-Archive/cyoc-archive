<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daren strode into the living room and turned on the television. If his improved body hadn&#39;t made him feel virile and strong, the thought of his boyfriend turned into a sexless little sprite, denuded of maturity, would have easily done the trick. He decided to lean into their circumstances. As Chris showered, Daren set up parental controls on the television and he was amused to find himself getting hard as he did so. <br />
<br />
Chris trudged into the living room whilst Daren was putting the finishing touches on the program, ensuring only channels such as Nick Jnr and Cbeebies could be accessed. He had a wet towel wrapped around his lower body, but it was so big half of it trailed sloppily behind him, soaking the floor in his wake. Daren looked at the mess and grew cross &quot;Chris you&#39;re getting everything wet. Put that towel in the laundry basket.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris looked exasperated. &quot;But there&#39;s no clothes for me to wear! Nothing fits me!&quot; he said in a voice so high pitched and adorable that it made Daren&#39;s heart melt from the cuteness. Daren just snorted &quot;It doesn&#39;t bother me&quot; he said, turning deliberately around to display his full body for Chris&#39;s benefit, his ponderous dick swinging in front of him. Chris blushed and averted his eyes, the adult within warring with the child he had become. &quot;That&#39;s not fair!&quot; he pouted, &quot;stuff still fits you, it would just be a little tight&quot;.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to debate this Chris. I&#39;m the man, you&#39;re the boy. Put the towel in the laundry basket now or I&#39;ll put you over my knee again&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chris looked like he was going to protest it further, but Daren&#39;s stern gaze made his will falter. &quot;Can I at least get a fresh towel?&quot; he asked plaintitively as he walked back up the hall to where the laundry basket was.<br />
&quot;No&quot; Daren responded &quot;and before you ask why, it&#39;s because you are questioning everything I tell you to do. So it&#39;s a lesson to do as your told. Now go put the towel in the laundry basket and I&#39;ll get you your breakfast so you can watch TV&quot;<br />
<br />
Daren popped over to the breakfast bar and opened a cupboard. On one side he had his own breakfast and snacks, muesli and dried fruit, and on the other Chris had kept his favorites, pop tarts, frosties and coco pops. His boyfriend had always been a bit of a kid at heart, and his choice of food merely confirmed it.<br />
<br />
He took a bowl out of one of the adjoining cupboards, half filled it with coco-pops (portion appropriate for a kid) and filled it with milk. He watched as the milk turned a chocolately brown before returning to the couch. Chris was wisely ensconced on the couch, and Daren was unsurprised to see him wrestling with the controls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go kiddo&quot; he said as he placed the bowl on the small table in front of them, ignoring Chris shooting him daggers at the use of the word &#39;kiddo&#39;. Chris ignored the bowl of food in front of him, instead waving the remote in Daren&#39;s face &quot;I can&#39;t change the channel!&quot; he whined. &quot;I know&quot; Daren said as he sat down next to Chris. &quot;But why?&quot; Chris said, his face twisted in a frown so profound Daren struggled to stifle a life. &quot;Because you&#39;re a kid&quot; Daren answered, &quot;and kids should watch only age appropriate programming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re sitting naked right next to me! And I&#39;m naked&quot; Chris said. Daren nodded, impressed at the logic but he wasn&#39;t dissuaded. &quot;I&#39;m not a TV program though, am I. And neither are you&quot;.<br />
Chris refused to give up. &quot;But this program&quot; he waved at the screen where a fuzzy blue bear was for some reason singing a duet with the moon, &quot;it&#39;s for little kids!&quot;<br />
&quot;You are a little kid&quot; Daren retorted in amusement, finding Chris to be unbearably cute like this.<br />
&quot;Yeah but this is for little LITTLE kids and I&#39;m not that little&quot; he said finally. And instantly realised his error, eyes widening in horror.<br />
&quot;Ah&quot; said Daren in mock revelation, reaching for the phone on the mobile table where he had left it.<br />
&quot;No, no, no&quot; Chris said in a panic as his tiny hands scrabbled over his bulging bicep. <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry kid&quot; Daren said soothingly, ruffling Chris&#39;s hair with his free hand. &quot;I can fix that easily&quot;. He opened the app once more for Chris, hovered his finger over the age slider, and dragged it down from seven to four before hitting apply.<br />
<br />
He felt Chris&#39;s already small hands retreat backwards as his already miniscule body shrank even further. He was still a skinny thingm but he plumped with baby fat and his rose coloured hair twisted into the most adorable curls. Bright, almost innocent eyes gazed up at him, beginning to well with tears. Daren burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no&#39;t fun-nee&quot; his toddler boyfriend whined pathetically before bursting into tears. <br />
&quot;Awww&quot; Daren said, pulling him into a comforting embrace. &quot;There, there. Daddy&#39;s here for his little man&quot;<br />
&quot;Yer no&#39;t my Daddee&quot; Chris said between sniffles.<br />
&quot;Now now&quot; Daren said. &quot;Mr.Shimizu is your father, that&#39;s true. But he&#39;s too old to look after you and besides you live with me, not him.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pushed Chris away so he could look into his eyes. &quot;He&#39;s your father, but I&#39;m your Daddy. And I want you to call me Daddy from now on, no matter what, understand?&quot; Chris looked puzzled for a moment, and Daren thought he had made him so young he had somewhat impaired his reasoning, but the adult was still in there and eventually there was a jerking nod of the head, rosy curls bobbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my good little boy&quot; Daren said with a big smile as he ruffled those curls. &quot;Now eat your breakfast sweetheart and watch your cartoons. Daddy will see about getting us some clothes. Does that sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris vigorously nodded his head &quot;A-huh, tank-you Daddee&quot;. Daren softly kissed his forehead, and got up, leaving his toddler boyfriend on the couch. As he left the room, Daren saw him beginning to become engrossed in what looked a like a re-run of Barney the Dinosaur, even starting to bob along to one of the hyper annoying songs he was known for.<br />
<br />
He rushed into the bathroom, closed the door, and grabbed his rock hard dick. Pre-cum was liberally leaking from it. If he&#39;d been running nearly dry before this would empty his tank. But he imagined what Chris was feeling now, deep within his tot frame, his mind bending under the desires of a pre-schooler. The imagined humiliation of his beau caused the glee inside of him to well up with each strong stroke of his might brown cock, a cock which dwarfed the tiny nub Chris now spouted. And with that thought, Daren came forcibly, a thick spurt of cum landing in the toilet bowl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s the Daddy?&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I&#39;m the Daddy!&quot;</p>
