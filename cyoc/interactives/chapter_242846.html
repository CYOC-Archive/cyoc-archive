<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will Weiss idly ran a hand through her messy shock of blonde hair as she talked on the phone with Tori Vordenburg. &quot;That&#39;s right, Tori,&quot; Will said into the phone. &quot;I&#39;m stuck living with the fucking leeches until I can get in touch with a realtor so I can rent my own place. I can&#39;t just go back home, y&#39;know. Roxy needs me. Scratch that. <i>Pandora von Karnstein-Weiss</i> needs me. New leech name and all that shit. So, how&#39;s the drive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m on the way back,&quot; Tori said. &quot;Traffic&#39;s so-so. At least Fiona and Megan are on their way to Japan to find out what Beck&#39;s up to at that kappa&#39;s sumo heya.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They could be in danger,&quot; Will said darkly. &quot;I&#39;ve dealt with kappas who were total psychopathic bastards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, they&#39;re a mixed lot,&quot; Tori responded. &quot;Some of them just wanna sumo wrestle and eat cucumbers. If we&#39;re lucky, that&#39;s what Fiona and Megan will find Beck&#39;s mixed up with. If we&#39;re lucky. So, are you worried that becoming a vampire will change Roxy for the worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t like vampires either,&quot; Will protested, &quot;but <i>I</i> can admit that some individual vampires can be okay. The one called Valeria&#39;s been great to us. Like I told you earlier, she saved Roxy&#39;s life from that Obyzouth bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tori&#39;s voice grew steely. &quot;Don&#39;t let the von Karnsteins fool you, Will. My family&#39;s been tangled up with theirs long enough to know that they&#39;re bad news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Laura Hollis incident was a hell of a long time ago,&quot; Will shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t entirely trust Carmilla either, but Consort Mircalla says she WANTED to be turned. Now, I personally find that messed up as fuck, but it doesn&#39;t really count as vamps getting out of line.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s bullshit,&quot; Tori grumbled. &quot;You know how vampire mesmerism is, especially with a leech as old and powerful as Matriarch Carmilla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying I totally believe her,&quot; Will said. &quot;I&#39;m just trying to look at this like a detective. Innocent until proven guilty, right? And my personal experiences leave me inclined to trust at least Valeria. Maybe I&#39;m not ready to trust Carmilla yet, but Val&#39;s been a good girlfriend to Pandora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I <i>guess</i> that&#39;s a possibility...&quot; Tori said dubiously. &quot;Hey, I just remembered something you should know about!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do spill!&quot; Will grinned, always eager for another case.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the werehyena pack?&quot; Tori asked. &quot;Kinda new? Led by some teen named Selena Lyall? You know, the one Beck&#39;s part of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know who you mean,&quot; Will nodded. &quot;I still haven&#39;t met them yet, but I think I get their niche in Stokerville&#39;s monster community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, some werehyenas from out of town joined up,&quot; Tori said. &quot;The one you need to watch is named Kibibi Mwangi. Shi&#39;s the daughter of the alpha of that pack from Fort Hyde, Oklahoma. Shi&#39;s aggressive as hell, and hir sire sent hir up here to learn some humility. Also Erzulie says there was some trouble back home where shi castrated a packmate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d Erzulie find out?&quot; Will asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s made a Voodoo doll of Kibibi that lets her root through the brute&#39;s thoughts whenever she wants,&quot; Tori said proudly. &quot;My sexy lady&#39;s amazing. Anyway, Kibibi brought hir mate Asanti Kombe with hir, and Asanti&#39;s niece Asha stowed away. Little scamp&#39;s a huge troublemaker. Had a werefox dad from what I heard, and you know how <i>those</i> creeps are. Asha&#39;s actually the main reason I&#39;m telling you all this. Shi stole an age potion from Morgana Faye and aged hirself to adulthood. Shi is WAY too eager to have sex, and nobody&#39;s bothered to de-age hir back into a cub. Fucking crazy-balls, right? At least Morgana had the sense to put Asha under a geis. Something about never being able to have sex until shi finds true love. Still, Erzulie plans to de-age hir down to hir original age at the first opportunity. We&#39;ll let you know if we need any help from a fellow monster hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to help!&quot; Will grinned. &quot;Anyone else come with Kibibi and hir family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly some werehyena refugees from Saudi Arabia,&quot; Tori answered. &quot;You know how genocidal those radicals in al-Suyuf al-Khaliq are getting. They give all of us legit monster hunters a damn bad name. Anyway, four werehyenas from a pack those guys wiped out are coming here to start a new life. Their names are Isra, Najma, Basma, and Qamar. Oh, and some werecat named Kathy Gibson tagged along. She&#39;s obviously not joining Selena&#39;s pack like the others, but she wants to establish herself up here in Washington state now that her old pride&#39;s kicked her out for pissing off the alpha one too many times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the info,&quot; Will said. &quot;I may be watching over Stokerville for a while, so I need to know my new beat inside out. So, what does Kibibi look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Giant slab of muscle with jet black fur with gold spots,&quot; Tori said. &quot;She&#39;s a black girl with a shaved head in her human form. Well, I gotta go. If I don&#39;t get back on the road soon, I might not get back until sunrise. Erzulie&#39;ll think I drove off a cliff!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, bye!&quot; Will said. Once Tori hung up, Will stood up and stretched. Suddenly realizing she was thirsty, she decided to go find a beer in the guest kitchen. That was another point in the von Karnsteins&#39; favor. Those undead lesbians knew how to treat a guest. Even though they themselves feasted on blood alone, they kept a well-stocked pantry full of mortal food just in case they had company of the non-sanguinary persuasion. Also, Will had to admit that it was nice to be surrounded by other lesbians. Aside from her pansexual sister, Will sometimes felt pretty marginalized in a mostly heterosexual world. The von Karnsteins might be leeches, but they could understand the workings of Will&#39;s heart.<br />
<br />
As Will stepped out of her room, she collided with something that felt like a shaggy carpet coating a lump of steel. When Will picked herself up off the floor, she found herself looking at a truly massive werehyena with black fur speckled with golden spots. There could be no doubt who <i>this</i> was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kibibi Mwangi!&quot; Will spat, accidentally whacking herself in the face with Kibibi&#39;s flaccid cock as she stood up to full height. &quot;What are YOU doing here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I live here right now,&quot; Kibibi growled. &quot;My new pack doesn&#39;t exactly have territory yet. Who even are you?! You don&#39;t smell like any vampire I&#39;ve ever met!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because I&#39;m <i>not</i> a vamp,&quot; Will answered, rolling her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m a monster hunter. My name&#39;s Wilhelmina Weiss, but everybody calls me Will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kibibi returned the greeting by roughly shoving Will against the hallway wall. &quot;Give me ONE good reason I shouldn&#39;t drag your ass in front of Matriarch Carmilla! Are you here to hurt her?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell, no!&quot; Will spat. &quot;I&#39;m her guest, same as you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe you!&quot; Kibibi snarled. &quot;I&#39;m not taking chances when I find a &#39;monster&#39; hunter prowling the halls of my host&#39;s home at night!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s all that shouting?&quot; a voice coming from Valeria&#39;s room asked. &quot;Val and I are trying to make love?&quot;<br />
<br />
Two nude vampires emerged from the room. Will sighed in relief as she recognized Pandora and Valeria. &quot;Sis, tell this furball who I am before shi eats my liver! Shi thinks I&#39;m here to kill Carmilla!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kibibi, it&#39;s fine,&quot; Valeria groaned. &quot;She&#39;s our guest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Pandora nodded. &quot;She&#39;s my sister! She came with me when I drove down here to hook up with Val, and she&#39;s been Carmilla&#39;s houseguest since I got turned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A demon drained Pandora dry and I had to turn her into a vampire to save her life,&quot; Valeria added. &quot;It was all very sudden, and it kind of uprooted Will&#39;s life. She&#39;ll be living here until she can find a house to rent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be living under the same roof as a monster hunter?!&quot; Kibibi thundered. &quot;My first night here is officially a disaster! Still... I guess I can release her if you guys vouch for her.&quot; Shi awkwardly released Will from the grip of hir strong claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, if you don&#39;t mind, we have to get back to our sex,&quot; Valeria said frostily. &quot;Try to keep it down. Come on, Pan.&quot; With that, Valeria and Pandora flounced back into Valeria&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we have to tolerate each other, Will,&quot; Kibibi said, embarrassedly scratching hir wild mane.<br />
<br />
&quot;I imagine we do,&quot; Will agreed. &quot;I won&#39;t act like a psycho cunt if you won&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal, I guess,&quot; Kibibi shrugged.<br />
<br />
Will forced an attempt at a smile to keep Kibibi pacified. She suddenly spotted two more figures walk into the hall. If they were werehyenas, they were both in human form. One was a woman with dark coffee skin, cornrow braids, and prominent nipple piercings. The other was a girl in her late teens with equally dark skin, an unruly mop of brilliantly red hair, and a cheeky expression. Both of them were stark naked. More werehyenas, no doubt.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got a little lost,&quot; the one with the cornrows and nipple piercings said. &quot;This manor is so crazy huge! I hope the al-Dabu family found their rooms okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they did, Asanti,&quot; Kibibi shrugged. &quot;Did Asha behave herself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean aside from trying to steal anything shiny?&quot; Asanti grumbled as she shot the African redhead a dirty look. &quot;I swear, she&#39;s been WORSE ever since she &#39;grew up&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will found herself staring at Asha. Tori had listed the young scamp as a priority. It would likely be Erzulie who solved the age mess, but Will figured it was best to keep her own eyes open for anything useful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, who&#39;s our new friend?&quot; Asha grinned impishly, noticing Will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some &#39;monster&#39; hunter called Will Weiss,&quot; Kibibi grumbled. &quot;Her sister just joined Clan von Karnstein and Will&#39;s been Carmilla&#39;s gonna be Carmilla&#39;s guest for a while, so we have no choice but tolerating her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can do, general!&quot; Asha chirped, throwing Kibibi a mocking salute. She came bounding over to Will. &quot;Hi, Will! I&#39;m Asha, and I&#39;m the coolest werehyena EVER! Wanna see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Will could say anything, Asha started to shift. Red and white fur covered her body as her feet stretched out into paws. Her mop of red hair slithered down her back as it became a mane, stopping just above her toned ass. As her nails sharpened, her secondary breasts budded and a bushy, almost foxlike tail exploded from Asha&#39;s lower back. Asha grinned like an idiot as her face pushed out into a muzzle and her ears reshaped.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Asha&#39;s clit began to swell and stick out... and out... and out. It began to morph into a true penis as hir pussy moved backward. A loose sack grew in the empty space, which was quickly filled with a pair of juicy balls. Asha was so thrilled by hir shift that hir new cock instantly got hard. Shi stuck a dramatic pose for Will&#39;s benefit. &quot;Ta-da!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Impressive,&quot; Will admitted. &quot;I have to admit, I&#39;ve never seen a werehyena who looked quite like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hir father was a werefox,&quot; Asanti explained. &quot;He broke my sister Amari&#39;s heart when he ran off and left hir alone and pregnant with Asha. I&#39;ve been trying to help Amari keep Asha on the right track ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A losing battle,&quot; Kibibi laughed humorlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Asha snickered. &quot;Trouble&#39;s in my blood!&quot; Shi suddenly frowned. &quot;I just wish that stuped geis would go away so I could get into the REALLY fun trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not have this argument in front of a stranger, Asha,&quot; Asanti suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, nice to meet you all,&quot; Will said, awkwardly clearing her throat. &quot;Anyway, I have a beer to get. See you around, I guess.&quot; Will quickly skulked off in the direction of the quest kitchen, thinking about this unexpected encounter. So Kibibi and hir party would actually be <i>living</i> with her and Pandora. This was bound to be <i>interesting</i>... and there was still five werebeasts here to meet!</p>
