<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yeah man,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;I&#39;m getting kind of bored here anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two headed for Paul&#39;s big truck and headed back for his house. Paul&#39;s parents were decently well off. Nothing too big, but he did have the basement completely to himself. There was a big screen down there, and all his weights for working out whenever he didn&#39;t want to go to the gym. His parents were supportive of his football aspirations, even if they weren&#39;t fully into sports. Somehow he&#39;d won the lottery on the gene pool as his dad was just barely over 5&#39;8&quot;. And no one on either side of his family seemed to be over 6&#39;. <br />
<br />
Paul opened the door slowly. &quot;Jeez!&quot; Jeff rang out. <br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;SHH!&quot; Paul instantly closed it again. &quot;My parents are sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez,&quot; Jeff said a bit more quietly. &quot;That stupid fair has me feeling wiped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Paul whispered back. He ushered Jeff down into the basement and closed the door behind him. &quot;I don&#39;t know what that wishing thing was...&quot; After the wish, his body just felt so foreign to him. He kept pulling at the collar of his shirt, and his shoes seemed to be squeezing at his feet. Being able to kick them off was a relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, it&#39;s just a stupid joke to play on tourists,&quot; Jeff plopped himself down on the couch and grabbed a video game controller. He turned on the system and booted up a football game. &quot;Don&#39;t think too much about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Paul replied. He sat down at the other end of the couch, grabbing the other controller. Even if it was his house, somehow Jeff always got to be player one. Jeff loaded up a game and picked their teams. Paul went for his favorite, the Kansas City Chiefs, while Jeff just chose random. He was so much better than Paul that it didn&#39;t even matter what team he played on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going for old reliable?&quot; Jeff mocked. &quot;How many games have you won with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough,&quot; Paul muttered.<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed. &quot;I think you mean 2. And one of them I had my eyes closed.&quot; The opening cinematic of the football players going to their sides of the fields. &quot;Oh and there you are!&quot; Jeff pointed out when Paul&#39;s custom made character rushed out on screen. It was 6&#39;8&quot; and a good 320ish pounds of muscle and a bit of fat. He&#39;d nearly maxed out all the stats, making the character as large as possible. &quot;One can dream, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot;<br />
<br />
The game started and Jeff was already winning. He&#39;d been able to throw a couple of passes down the field and always knew how duke Paul&#39;s players. Even when there were three options on the front, Jeff seemed to be able to know exactly which one Paul was going to pick and then choose one that would work perfectly against Paul&#39;s. <br />
<br />
When the score his 18-0 Jeff started laughing. &quot;How about I just pick with my eyes closed from now on. K?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul grit his teeth. He hated how bad he was at the game. And more that he didn&#39;t know how Jeff was so good at it. He let out a huff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now no cheating and looking at what I choose...&quot; Jeff taunted. <br />
<br />
Paul let out another huff as the game started. He chose the play he wanted to perform and then watched the players line up. Somehow he&#39;d actually chosen a good position. At least compared to what Jeff had. There was a wide opening on the right. And no way for Jeff to get his players there. Paul quickly hiked the ball and watched the players to fill the gap, but it was too quick and he was able to toss the ball down the field, which was then caught and run into the end zone. &quot;18-6&quot; It was followed quickly by a field goal kick, making it &quot;18-7&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job man. All you needed was to go against a blind man and you might be alright at the game,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright let&#39;s do it again. Think you can catch up?&quot;<br />
<br />
The plays were quickly selected again. It was Jeff&#39;s ball and he&#39;d chosen wrong again. As long as his offensive line was able to hold off the defense, he could squeeze one of his players through. Paul watched as Jeff followed the play perfectly. That&#39;s when he rushed a guy through, just barely making it before being tackled and was up in front of the receiver. Paul&#39;s player jumped for the ball, just barely catching it in front of Jeff&#39;s player, and instantly started sprinting back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me!&quot; Jeff shouted. The anger and surprise was enough to get him to nearly drop his controller. &quot;No way!&quot; but it was too late and Paul&#39;s player was already at the end zone scoring another 6 points. And 1 more for a field goal. &quot;Man you really tore my ass open with that one... No more eyes closed for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul smiled. He looked over at his friend, but something seemed different. A weird stirring in his body was taking over. He could feel his blood pumping faster. Somehow he&#39;d never seen his friend this way.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeff stared blankly back. &quot;You actually going to fuck me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nu-oh,&quot; Paul forced his eyes back on the screen. Though the feeling stayed. He adjusted himself in his seat, but all he could do was hope Jeff wouldn&#39;t look down.</p>
