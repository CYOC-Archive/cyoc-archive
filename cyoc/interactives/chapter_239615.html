<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing the word “vaca” had focused Steve into a cow theme transformation, but he realized that was a sort of red herring.  Not only could it backfire but it didn’t necessarily eliminate the one player who had the wherewithal to look for a way out of the center.  A new idea popped into Steve’s head – one that would permanently eliminate the man without risking killing him.<br />
<br />
Steve selected the words “Jose Vaca” and changed them to “Austin’s cunt”.  Sure, it was possible that the man would end up as a disembodied pussy lying on the floor, but that was a chance that Steve was willing to take.  <br />
<br />
Hitting enter, Steve looked back into the community center and the first thing he noticed was the absolutely bizarre sight of Austin’s crotch.  Laying spread legged on her back, the bitch’s tail was wagging in pain.  Above that, Steve could see her asshole distended from within as the baby wedged into her vagina pressed down into the internal flesh that separated those two areas.  But where the anthro bitch’s vagina should be, there was instead a bizarre, portal like hole that looked like the static on untuned tv.<br />
<br />
Austin’s body spasmed as she grabbed her shins, apparently unaware of her now missing cunt.  Then Steve saw the man in the back of the room.<br />
<br />
Instead of searching for the key, Jose Vaca was now facing the parking lot with his back against leaning into the wall.  His eyes were closed, and it didn’t take much to figure out why.  Where the man’s mouth and nose should be, there was instead a circle of brown fur surrounding a tight ring of stretched, black lips.  Pressing painfully out of those lips were two tiny ears and behind them, the brown dome of the baby that was crowning in the anthro bitch cunt that now occupied much of the man’s face.  <br />
<br />
Austin’s contraction subsided and Steve watched as the flesh on Jose’s face seemed to relax ever so slightly, though the head remained firmly wedged in his tight pussy lips.  Opening his eyes, Jose brought his hands up to his face as he began to explore the new orifice on it.  His fingers passed through the thin pubic fur surrounding the pussy, then ran slowly along its stretched black lips.  <br />
<br />
Next, a finger found the baby’s head, before running across the dog ear attached to it.  Jose pinched that ear and began running his fingers along it.  Steve could see the man’s eyes go cross as he tried to get a better view of what he was feeling, as though he was wondering “what is this thing coming out of my mouth?”  <br />
<br />
Little did Jose know, but while still had lips, he would never have mouth.  No, with a simple tap of a touchscreen, Steve had doomed this man to spend the rest of his life as an anthro bitch’s cunt.  And not any anthro bitch – a breeding slave whose entire body had been designed from the ground up to give birth to as many anthro dogs as possible.<br />
<br />
Steve didn’t know what Jose had been before – whether he had been a cashier or a rocket scientist, it no longer mattered.  Whatever skills or talents, hope or dreams that Jose might have had were all useless now.  Jose would never land that dream job; he’d never have a family or go on a trip around the world.  No, he’d spend the rest of his life stuck between Austin’s thighs.  The only experience that he could look forward to, in fact that only experience he would have from now, was getting to be a passive observer as Austin pissed, got fucked, and gave birth.<br />
<br />
Jose’s eyes went wide with fear as his legs began moving of their own accord, propelling his body across the room.  The man began desperately waived his arms as he grabbed onto one of the gaming tables, but his legs kept carrying him forward and all he managed to do was knock some game pieces onto the floor.  The clatter attracted the attention of the other players in the room, but they all gave Jose a wide berth as soon as they saw the overstretched cunt on his face.<br />
<br />
The man’s body planted itself in front of Austin, then pressed his butt down against Austin’s crotch.  Human flesh melted into anthro dog hair as Jose shrank between a pair of thick, furry thighs.  Jose’s legs were forced up into his chest as they merged with it, all while his torso continued to sink deeper and deeper into Austin’s snatch.  Grabbing onto Austin’s shins, Jose tried to pull himself free, but his efforts were in vain as his hands evaporated and his arms shriveled away.<br />
<br />
Now nothing more than a pussy-mouthed head on Austin’s crotch, brown fur overtook what little remained of Jose until all that was left of him were two terrified eyes sitting on either side of the crowning head.  Those too didn’t last long as they sealed up, leaving nothing more than a single tear running through the fur on the right side of Austin’s cunt.<br />
<br />
For all of the terrified looks in the room, none matched Austin’s wide-eyed stare as she pawed around the sides of her pussy – clearly in shock from the feeling of another person merging with her crotch.  But it wasn’t long until Austin’s eyes closed and cried out in agony as another contraction turned her pelvic bones and the baby inside of her into a sort of twisted vice that clamped down on her body’s delicate flesh.<br />
<br />
“Phew.  That went better than I could have imagined,” Steve huffed to himself, thankful that he wasn’t stuck with having to deal with a failed merger of the two men.  Still, now that Jose was literally nothing more than part of Austin’s body, would the app still consider Jose to be a valid target?<br />
<br />
“Ding”<br />
<br />
Steve opened up the targeting window in the app and confirmed that yes, the app did consider Jose to be a valid and distinct target.  Curious, he generated another sentence for the newly minted pussy:<br />
<br />
“The breeding slave’s cunt is confused about what happened to it.”<br />
<br />
Chuckling to himself, Steve wasn’t sure he could fully appreciate that statement.  Transforming from a man into a bitch’s birthing vagina in 30 seconds?  Confusing was probably the understatement of the year.  <br />
<br />
And just like with the police officer turned vixen, Steve didn’t want to leave Jose in the dark about what had happened to him.  But unlike with the vixen, there was no way that Steve would ever be able to explain Jose’s fate to him. <br />
<br />
Then again, the app had given Steve a lucky break with that sentence.  Selecting “confused about”, Steve changed the words to “knows exactly” and hit enter, watching as the sentence reformed to:<br />
<br />
“The breeding slave’s cunt knows exactly what happened to it.”<br />
<br />
Perfect.</p>
