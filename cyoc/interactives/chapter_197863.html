<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh. My. God. Brad, what the fuck?!&quot; Brad heard a voice shout. He instantly and guiltily removed his hand from his pants. He glanced towards the sound of the voice. It was Garrett, the supervisor and coordinator for the North American species&#39; exhibits, and Brad&#39;s boss. He was a tall, beefy man in his upper 30s. A normally calm and collected guy, his face betrayed just sheer astonishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, h-h-hey, Garrett,&quot; Brad attempted and slightly waved his hand, the same hand that had just a slight bit of Ajax&#39;s cum on it. A droplet flung into the air and landed right in front of Garrett&#39;s feet. Both of their faces flushed red; Brad&#39;s out of embarrassment and Garrett&#39;s out of anger.<br />
<br />
Through clenched teeth, Garrett growled, &quot;Office. Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad ducked his head and quickly walked towards the zoo office building. He kept his head down as he walked. He became acutely aware of every rip and tear in his shirt. He didn&#39;t know if people were staring at him, but he felt like everyone who could be staring at him was. In his mind, he tried to make sense of what he had just done. It had felt so natural to allow the two wolves have their way with him. He had found it immensely erotic for some reason. Not to mention the fact that his cock and balls had changed into a pussy and clit. A pussy that he was finding less and less strange to have. Was he even a he anymore? For all intents and purposes, he was. The only feminine part of him was deeply filled with cum. Not just any cum, cum from a <i>wolf</i>.<br />
<br />
Brad released an uncharacteristic whine as he walked through the office building towards Garrett&#39;s office. He caught Bryan&#39;s eye as he passed. He didn&#39;t say anything and went into the office. Garrett was close behind him and slammed the door shut.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Two more zookeepers, Jamal and Michael, came into the office. The two of them and Bryan stared at the shut office door. They all could hear Garrett unloading his rage into Brad through the door, although Bryan couldn&#39;t quite make out the words.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Jamal mumbled. &quot;Is that Garrett in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like it,&quot; Michael said quietly. &quot;I thought I saw him following Brad inside. Brad&#39;s usually a good worker. What could he have possibly done that made Garrett so angry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno, but whatever it was, sounds like Brad is fucked out of a job here pretty soon,&quot; Jamal remarked.<br />
<br />
Bryan turned to his computer and put his headphones in, trying to give the illusion that he was busy with something. He felt guilty because it wasn&#39;t Brad&#39;s fault for what had happened to him. That was all Bryan&#39;s doing. He had originally wanted Brad to be aware of the changes that were happening to him. He hadn&#39;t realized that he had forgotten to make it so others wouldn&#39;t notice or care about them. Now, Brad was likely going to lose his job for doing this.<br />
<br />
Bryan desperately tried to come up with a solution. What if that was part of Brad&#39;s job, getting fucked by those wolves? But how would that work? He started to look through the options, working as quickly as he could for Brad&#39;s sake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me ONE good reason why I shouldn&#39;t fire you on the spot, right fucking now!&quot; Garrett yelled. &quot;Hell, I should probably call the cops or something. Goddammit! I can&#39;t even <i>begin</i> to imagine how I would frame that on the phone.&quot; He took a deep breath and glared at Brad expectedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Brad stammered. His heart was pounding in his chest. He desperately wanted to keep this job. &quot;I&#39;ve been your go-to guy on any project you&#39;ve given us. I&#39;ve led the team towards success many times, like when we remodeled the hyena exhibit. Just ask Sukari! He loves it in there! I&#39;ve given you no reason to doubt my commitment to doing right by these animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why, Brad, that I&#39;m...&quot; Garrett paused and took a deep breath. His face softened. &quot;Which is why, Brad, that I&#39;m less than thrilled that you went ahead and did this without getting clearance first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Brad frowned. He blinked several times. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it because we were dragging our feet on saying yes to letting you participate?&quot; Garrett asked. The rage was gone and replaced with a mix of irritation and sympathy. And, was it Brad&#39;s imagination, or was Garrett&#39;s stomach a little larger?<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... participate?&quot; Brad repeated, trying to piece together Garrett&#39;s sudden change in mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the Fertility Program,&quot; Garrett said. His stomach was pushing his supervisor polo out more than his muscular pecs were now. It kept slowly growing. Garrett&#39;s hair was also changing from blonde to black. Then the gravity of what Garrett just said hit Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fertility Program,&quot; he repeated simply. Was... was that what just happened with him? Did Ajax just impregnate him? And why did that idea make him happy? He began to smile slightly in spite of himself. The two wolves, <i>his</i> wolves, were going to have a pack of their own.<br />
<br />
Garrett chuckled. &quot;I promise it wasn&#39;t because we didn&#39;t think you wouldn&#39;t be committed to it.&quot; He rubbed his still growing belly. The polo shirt was riding up and got caught on the outie belly button. &quot;It&#39;s just a lot of responsibility and comes with a slew of side-effects.&quot; He scratched the black hair that was growing thicker on his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Side... effects?&quot; Brad asked. He watched in awe as Garrett&#39;s belly continued to grow as did his hair. He instinctively placed his own hand on his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Garrett said, sitting down in his chair with a grunt. &quot;Other than the obvious mobility issues, you&#39;ll develop some physical characteristics of those wolves, and your pussy will be likely raring to go at a moment&#39;s notice for the next week or so.&quot; He grunted and adjusted his pants. &quot;Or you&#39;ll be like me and feel an aching need to have your pussy filled constantly. That will be later in your pregnancy.&quot; He then remembered something else. &quot;Oh, and your hormones will be geared towards them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-meaning?&quot; Brad asked, staring at his now very pregnant supervisor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Orion and Ajax will be your only mate-partners,&quot; Garrett said. &quot;They&#39;ll be attracted to you, and you to them, from now on. No other animals, not even other wolves, will want to mate with you.&quot; Garrett gave him a sympathetic expression. &quot;We knew you cared so much about these animals, we weren&#39;t sure if you would be satisfied with the choice you made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad blushed as the memory of the intense orgasms earlier washed over him. &quot;I think I&#39;ll be more than satisfied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Garrett chuckled. &quot;You sound like I did after Samson mated with me.&quot; His voice grew husky. &quot;Let me just say, that gorilla can fuck.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;And that boy likes to cuddle, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samson the gorilla is Garrett&#39;s, what did he call it, &quot;mate-partner&quot; in this Fertility Program that suddenly seemed to sprout out of nowhere. The mental image of Samson leaning over this big guy came unbidden into Brad&#39;s mind. Brad expected arousal to flash deep inside him, but he realized that he was thinking of Samson. He then thought about Ajax and Orion. Sure enough, he felt a flash of heat deep inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re not mad that I... let, erm, uh,&quot; Brad stumbled over his words.<br />
<br />
&quot;That Ajax fucked your new pussy and impregnated you?&quot; Garrett asked so bluntly. &quot;I&#39;m not mad. I just wish you had been a little more patient. But what&#39;s done is done. No going back now.&quot; He heaved himself out of his chair. &quot;Now, let&#39;s go get you caught up on all the reading and training material you normally would have received before letting those wolves fuck you into a very satisfying orgasm.&quot;</p>
