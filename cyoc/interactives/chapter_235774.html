<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   I woke up the next morning still feeling the warm after glow of the previous night, smiling to myself. I got out of bed and stripped down before admiring myself in my mirror. I was used to seeing a naked girl now and I was starting to enjoy knowing that someday I would be a mom hopefully with a son or daughter of my own. I got dressed by pulling up a pair of bright pink underwear and shorts before going down to breakfast.<br />
     John was sitting at the table eating some cereal, he winked at me and pulled out his flaccid penis when Mom wasn&#39;t looking. I smiled and rubbed myself with two fingers. We stopped quickly as Mom turned around “ sleep well honey?” I nodded and poured some cereal into a bowl and added some milk” don&#39;t forget after school I&#39;m taking you two to get winter clothes you&#39;ve both changed so much in the past year none of your old stuff fits anymore”. I look between Mom and John “ that&#39;s a bit of an understatement isn&#39;t it?” Mom laughed “ I guess it is honey, hurry up and finish breakfast it&#39;s almost time to leave”. John and I finished our breakfast and gathered our backpacks and left to walk to school together.<br />
     As we walked down the street together I couldn&#39;t help but notice the bulge in his pants “ are you still horny?” He looked down and shrugged “ all the time” I couldn&#39;t help but find it funny “ as your little sister it&#39;s my duty to help you out whenever you want” he kicked a rock into the street “ don&#39;t get me wrong I really had fun last night but I think I like boys more I always want to spy on them in the bathrooms at school” “ there&#39;s nothing wrong with that I&#39;ve done the same thing myself only with girls” we walked in the rest of the way to school without incident.<br />
     We got to school and went our separate ways. I went to my classroom and sat down taking out my notebook and getting settled. The class was as usual boring. I knew most of it already from when I was older so I was easily the top student. Class went by slowly until it was time for gym. We went to the locker rooms splitting up between girls and boys. I walked into the locker room and picked an empty locker, no longer was I bothered by being around other naked girls. Why should i? I was a girl myself. I started undressing down to my underwear. I adjusted my training bra and pulled up my gym shorts “ do the boys have to wear shorts this tight?” The other girls shook their heads “ no the teacher is a perv he loves watching us when we run he&#39;s super gross too, how is a gym teacher fat” we finished getting ready and headed out to the gym as a group. <br />
       Mr. Logan was waiting for us sitting in a chair in the middle of the gym wearing sweats and holding a megaphone “about time ladies! Huuuury up! Let&#39;s goooo 15 laps warm up, don&#39;t let those boys beat you”. We started running. I was able to keep up with the boys but most of the girls were struggling. Mr. Logan  was watching us closely and I thought I noticed a bulge in his pants. I tried to distract myself by running faster concentrating on the boys in front of me while also feeling disgusted about men. 15 laps came and went and we lined up to play dodgeball “ mix it up mix it up I want two teams”. We divided ourselves into a mix of boys and girls and went to opposite sides. Mr. Logan blew his whistle and the game started. <br />
       I managed to survive the first few rounds until I took a hard throw to the chest slamming into my breasts causing me to gasp and almost fall down. I stumbled to the bench and sat down gasping for air “ a nerdy skinny boy asked me if I was ok and I nodded. He was new to the school and we talked about how much different things were here compared to our old schools “ we only moved here because of my dad&#39;s job he works at ( insert name)” my eyes grew wide “ my dad woke there too!” We became silent at that realization and changed the topic. Mr. Logan blew his whistle and class ended, we traded phone numbers quickly and went to the locker room to shower.<br />
       “Mr. Logan wants to see you cause you got hurt” Another girl told me” he wants to see you after you shower “ she rolled her eyes and grabbed her towel before walking into the showers. I undressed and examined my breasts. I had a slight bruise on and between my breasts that was still kinda tender when I touched it. I grabbed my towel and body wash and went to the showers. Girls everywhere in various stages of puberty I was not the furthest along but I was close. As I washed up I felt myself becoming aroused from the heat radiating from my pussy. I had to turn the cold water up to calm down.<br />
      After my shower I got dressed and went across the hallway sneaking a peek into the boys locker room but I didn&#39;t get lucky. Taking a deep breath I knocked on his door before quickly turning my phone&#39;s camera on and sticking it in my back pocket. “ Enter!” I pushed the door open and walked inside. It was cramped and smelly like old socks and ickiness, his desk was sideways and he told me to stand in front of him on the X. “I saw you get hit today let me see” I looked at him confused “ excuse me Mr. Logan”  <br />
“ Let…me… see … where…. the … ball… hit…you” he spaced each word out emphasizing each syllable” I won&#39;t ask again” I turned to leave but my path was blocked by his enormous bulk of sweaty ick, I could clearly see that he was aroused and he caught me looking” like what you see?” He grabbed himself and jerked it around “ you be a good girl and do as I say and I might let you see it”. My path still blocked I had no choice, I slowly took off my shirt and held it tightly” and the bra” he was getting closer to me and his smell was unbearable, body odor, stale smoke and I finally remembered the smell of my old teenage years the old socks I had shamefully hidden in the bottom of the laundry bag it was the sickening  smell of old cum. With trembling hands I took off my bra.<br />
        Standing in front of him with my chest completely exposed made me feel small. I truly felt like the little girl I had become. He stepped closer and touched me, his fat fingers rubbing against my nipples and between my budding breasts I felt sick. I just wanted to throw up. He continued touching me, his hands wrapped around my body and slid down to my waist. I was frozen in fear, unable to move, unable to stop him. His hands stopped at my shorts and he smiled and started pulling them down when the phone on his desk started ringing. Cursing he turned to answer it and I took the opportunity to run away remembering to grab my clothes from the desk.<br />
        I made it to the girls bathroom and locked myself in a stall with tears flowing down my cheeks. I sat down trembling. I cried silently sitting on the toilet seat still holding my shirt and bra. After taking several deep breaths I collected myself and got dressed before slipping out of the stall and washing my face. My eyes were still red and puffy but I couldn&#39;t do anything about that. I just got my sunglasses and went home.<br />
      I got home and immediately went to my room and closed the door behind me firmly locking it, I curled up on my bed feeling the tears forming again. My entire body felt disgusting, violated, soiled. I&#39;m just those few minutes he had destroyed me. I started shaking again as he molested me again and again. I was trembling again on the verge of a panic attack when someone tried to open my door “ Dahlia? Are you there?”</p>
