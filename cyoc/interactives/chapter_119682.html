<br />
As Luke and Matt entered opposite rooms, the door behind them immediately shut. Already at the point of no return, they tried to find away out of here, and the door opposite to where they came from is locked. There was a chute made for clothing, probably telling them to put their clothes in the chutes. Of course, they did and were left naked in their rooms. In Matt&#39;s room, several mechanical arms came out from the walls and floor as strange metallic cuffs and collar clamped around Matt&#39;s wrist, ankle, and neck and then retreat back into the wall. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; Matt exclaimed as Luke turned to the sound behind his room as a wall materialized a window in front of them. &quot;Matt, you okay?&quot; he asked him as Matt tries to tug the collars and cuffs off. &quot;I&#39;m fine, but what the hell are these things on me??&quot; In Luke&#39;s room, several sprays came out of the walls and sprayed some sort of misty chemical as Luke coughs and gags at the mist as they enter in his mouth, nose, and skin and any orifice he is exposed. Suddenly the spraying stopped.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s collar and cuffs then poke something inside his body as he winces from the pokes. It then injects some sort of nanobots inside his body as they change his body into something else. Matt looks at his arms and sees his body hair recede into his body or fall to the floor. On Luke&#39;s end, he fell to his knees as a panel of the floor opened up as his hands grabbed on to the side of upcoming front wheel and fused together, the rear wheels came up from behind and out of instinct, his ankles went to the sides of the rear wheel and merged together. Matt can feel his skin turn from his skin tone color to black leather and can feel somewhat hollow in his hands as his nails on his fingers disappear, puffing out a bit.<br />
&quot;M-Matt, what&#39;s happening to us?!&quot; Luke panicked, he too replied in panic, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I think I&#39;m turning into some sort of clothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s legs puff out as they become mufflers, his feet swells too and his toes merge as he wriggles them in unison as they were left unchanged and is left suspended in the air by his new wheels. Luke tries in vain to break free, but realizes that they are apart of him. He then feels uneasy inside as his organs shift becoming the interior parts of a motorcycle. This soon dawned on him, &quot;I... I think I&#39;m becoming a motorcycle!&quot; Matt&#39;s hands already became the sports motorcycle glove as Matt groans feeling the inside of his gloves hollow up. Soon his insides follows suit as they became special padding, his knee and elbow caps inside his flesh changing leather become some sort of protection pads too. Matt then stumbles to the back of the wall sliding to sit down as has a hard time standing up and looks down at his crotch realizing his genitals shrink and become a smooth groin. Luke was starting to feel his ears shift and stretch into handle bars; the top of his head shift and flatten into a windshield as the back of his head form the instruments and gauges (or the dashboard). His arms becomes the front fork which then links to his head realizing his movement is limited and synced as he turns from side to side, his back soon forms the back cover, the ignition, and gasoline intake. Luke then feels his ass stretch and goes over his rear wheels as they form signal lights. Matt tingles as a zipper and track forms at the base of his collar bone beneath his collar all they way down to his smooth crotch as he groans as the track finishes at the crotch area.<br />
<br />
Luke groans as his head shifts and morphs and merging to his body, his eyes then turns into headlights and his skin hardens into a bio organic plastic fairing that is covering his already changed insides. Matt looks down at his feet and watches his toes merge and swell into a pair of motorcycle boots and hollow out as the cuffs on his ankles shift up below his knees as he wriggles his boot feet. Already Luke was already done changing into motorcycle as his dick became erect and becomes a stand, still moaning for some reason even though he doesn&#39;t have lungs or mouth as he writhes, and thrusts for release, but can&#39;t no longer. Suddenly, Luke&#39;s vision fades after his change while Matt&#39;s changes is almost done. His body soon feels heavy and deflated, he groans and tries to stand up, but can&#39;t. Suddenly, w/ all his flesh turned to leather, his feet into motorcycle boots, and his hands into gloves, the last change is his head and groans feeling his mouth fuse shut and/or become the air holes, nose becoming his air holes too for his wearer to breath through and his hair soon recede or fall to the ground as his head becomes plastic and his eyes fused to become protecting visors and moans. Next thing he knows is that his vision fades to black like Luke now a strange bio sports motorcycle. His collar and cuffs then beeps as they disconnect from the one piece suit and his helmet head falls and rolls around near his motorcycle suit body.<br />
<br />
Just then, Matt groans and notices he is somehow still alive, still wondering what happened. His collar underneath his helmet head that is attached to him like his cuffs. He tries to move, his gloved fingers can move, but they&#39;re deflated, his boot feet were wriggling a bit. He tries to wonder what or how this happened to him until he remembers what happened that lead up to this point. He then let out a muffled scream and try to call out to Luke, but only let out a muffled grunts again. Matt wonders why he can&#39;t speak or move at all. His mind is in different places, he wonders what had happened to Luke, he wonders how he&#39;ll turn back to normal and for Luke too, or something else.<br />
<br />
Just then....</p>
