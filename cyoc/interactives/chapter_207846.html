<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott dug into his pocket and pulled out a bandana. “But this on, shrimp dick,” He commanded. “I’m taking you for a little ride.”<br />
<br />
Tyler gulped, not knowing what this man had in store for him, but he did what he was told like a good-small dick and wrapped the cloth around his eyes tightly. He heard a groan from the chair as the man stood up from it, and Tyler yelped when he felt a firm hand take hold of his upper arm and pull him to his feet, dragging him out of the kitchen and back into the garage. He heard the sound of a car door unlock and open before Scott said, “Watch your head, shortie,” he commanded. Tyler felt a firm hand grab hold of his rear and push him into the back seat of the car. A moment later, the car shook as Scott took the drivers seat and buckled himself in. Tyler heard the motor turn over, felt the car slide into reverse and back out of the driveway before speeding off at brisk pace. He could feel a turn hear, a curve there, but eventually he lost his sense of direction. The guy must be driving the backroads, he reasoned, wondering where he was being taken.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what felt like forever, the car came to a stop on a slight incline. Once again the car lurched as Scott stepped from the car, opening his door and grabbing Tyler by the arm again. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go, shortdick. They’re waiting for you.” He chuckled, ushering Tyler forward. He could hear crickets and the hum of air conditioners, and feel grass under his bare feet. Where was he? He heard a heavy door unlatch; it sounded familiar, and was pulled inside of wherever by Scott. Tyler’s stomach flipped when he heard various voices echoing through the house, all of them male. Some of them were deep, some rich and lively, and some a little high pitched. One or two he might have recognized. Tyler felt carpet under his feet as he was brought forward, the voices getting closer until suddenly they all stopped.<br />
<br />
“Well, look who it is! The new small-dick in town!” one deep voice guffawed.<br />
<br />
“Look how small he is! I’m jealous….” Another voice swooned.<br />
<br />
“Might be the smallest of us yet,” a third voice intoned.<br />
<br />
“Yup, a perfect small-dick. I’m proud of my boy,” a familiar voice purred. Was that his father. Finally, the blindfold came off.<br />
<br />
Tyler was shocked to find that he was standing in the doorway to his own kitchen; Scott must have given him the literal run-around. Seated at the table were three older men Tyler hadn’t seen before, and his father. He was even more surprised to see that they were all naked, and that three of them were small-dicks like him.<br />
<br />
“Howdy, son!” His father chuckled, leaning back in his seat and setting down his beer, “I see Scott did a good job at riling you up.” <br />
<br />
“What is this? Who are these guys?” Tyler asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
“I’m Adam,” said the one furthest from his father. He was light skinned, blond-haired, with a stocky, hairy body and a three inch cock jutting from his hairy crotch. His balls were large in proportion to his tiny cocklet. Other than a wispy mustache, he wasn’t very hairy, and he looked maybe a year or two older than Tyler. “Nice to meat you, fellow shrimp-dick,” he giggled coyly.<br />
<br />
“My name is Roy,” said the other, a stocky man with shaggy dark hair and a hirsute body. His small, purple cock-head was barely visible through his wiry pubes. “You might have seen me working at the auto shop.” He grinned, relaxed and resting back against the chair with his hand on his belly.<br />
<br />
“Good to see you again, Tyler,” said the third, a man of his father’s age. Tyler recognized him as one of his father’s friends from around town, Kelby. He was built a lot like his father; big chest and swaggering arms, a square jaw with a scruffy beard. The only difference was that whereas his father James had a semi-hard, twelve inch cock and growing laying over the chair between his legs, Kelby had only a small, pink nub and a pair of olive-sized balls. “Welcome to the club, brother!”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about, what club?” Tyler stammered.<br />
<br />
“Hope Scott wasn’t too rough with you, son,” his father chuckled. “I wanted you well-fed and ready for our little get together.”<br />
<br />
“I was good to him,” Scott promised. “this small-dick has a lot of enthusiasm though. You raised him right.” He grinned.<br />
<br />
His father continued, “Me, these scrawny shrimps,” the small-dicks all shuddered and moaned a bit. “And some of the other real men in town formed a little group. We large-dicks love teasing those pathetic excuses for dicks you have, of course. But this group is more dedicated to our…gratitude,” his father chose the word carefully. “After all, where would big, hard men like us be without eager short-dicks like you?”<br />
<br />
Tyler stared at the men and the ‘men’ in disbelief. “Wait, really?”<br />
<br />
“Well, sure,” Roy shrugged his shoulders while fondling his straining cocklet with two fingers. “Sure our cocks are small and will never measure up to real men like Scott or your father,” Roy drifted off as his eyes got lost in the straining bulge of Scott’s trousers. <br />
<br />
“But we’re still men,” Kelby continued. “Why shouldn’t we get to enjoy the finer things in life?”<br />
<br />
“Roy and Kelby were my buddies back in high school,” His father said. “and when the three of us began to notice that I was the only one growing into a real man, we decided to form this little club for the benefit of pathetic small dicks like you who are just lucky enough to pass for a real man.”<br />
<br />
“Back in our day, us small-dicks couldn’t compete in sports with the large-dicks.” Kelby began. “The humiliation was practically compulsory, and we would have lost our places on the football team, our scholarships, everything.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t interrupt, micro-dick,” His father barked in a stern tone, but with a smile he playfully teased Kelby’s balls, causing him to moan in pleasure. “Anyway, they may be small-dicks but they were still my friends. I helped them keep their newfound status on the downlow, kept up with a high protein diet so I could keep my boys full and healthy for the team. We brought the club back to life when we all moved back to town.”<br />
<br />
“There must be something in the water, here,” Scott said while unbuckling his belt. “You wouldn’t know how many small-dicked men live in this town just by looking.” He kicked off his shoes and let his pants fall to the ground. His thick cock hung free, almost fully hard. “If you don’t mind, James, I’m feeling kind of full again. And you, Adam, look a little hungry.” He chuckled while pulling off his shirt. <br />
<br />
“You read my mind, buddy.” Adam replied, already off his chair. <br />
<br />
“Don’t forget to move my shoes by the door, clit-dick. You know James likes a clean house.” Scott went to the living room and dropped himself on the couch. <br />
<br />
“And a clean couch!” James barked, before turning to his friends. <br />
<br />
“Yes, sirs, don’t get those big cocks of yours in a knot,” Adam chuckled, but he did move Scott’s shoes. Tyler was surprised; he’d never heard a small-dick talk back to a large-dick before. Scott made nothing of it, only grinning when Adam knelt down to take his place between Scott’s hairy legs. <br />
<br />
James noticed the other small-dicks in the room watching Adam work with hunger in their eyes, their tiny pricks straining and leaking, and Tyler was no different. He wasn’t hungry per se, but he could definitely go for another load, if he was being honest with himself. And for the first time, outside of the time spent with Colby, he felt comfortable enough to do so. <br />
<br />
“Any of you boys ready for dinner?” James asked his friends with a smirk, hefting his own semi-hard schlong. Tyler was still a little repulsed by seeing his father naked, but he couldn’t help but admire the thick, beautiful cock the superior man possessed. <br />
<br />
“Hell yeah, I haven’t eaten all day,” said, Kelby, stroking himself slowly as he watched Adam practically inhale Scott’s cock down to the base. <br />
<br />
“Well then get your hands of that tiny excuse for a cock and put your hands on some real meat,” James commanded, standing up. Kelby reached out to cup and squeeze James’s huge balls before doing the same. “And maybe a little something extra,” James growled, slapping Kelby’s hairy butt to usher him towards the bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Roy,” Kelby chuckled over his shoulder. “I’ll leave some for you.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I won’t hold my breath,” Roy grumbled, folding his arms over his chest. His purple-headed cock still peaked out from the forest of bushy pubic hair between his legs as he watched Adam continue his work on Scott’s cock. “Kelby always was a greedy little bastard.” He chuckled as Tyler took a seat next to him. “I ate before I came here, but don’t tell your father. Hired this new fledgling mechanic. Guys got no brains but a big, delicious cock.” Roy closed his eyes and licked his lips. “What about you, I heard that friend of yours you always pal around with is turning into quite the real man?”<br />
<br />
“Who, Colby?” Tyler replied. “Yeah, he’s, ugh, getting bigger every day,” Tyler chuckled, not knowing what else to say. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, his dad is a total prick, even if he has a beautifully gargantuan cock,” Roy admitted, bitterly. Joe, Colby’s father, was known around town as a bit of a braggart with regards to his twenty-one inch piece of man-meat. “Went to high school with him too. Glad he never found out back then our he would have made my life hell.”<br />
<br />
“So, you’ve never…?” Tyler trailed off.<br />
<br />
Roy shook his head. “No, much as I might want to. A small-dick has got to have some principles. Your father and the other men banned him from the club years ago.”<br />
<br />
“So, there are more club members?” Tyler asked curiously. His heart fluttered as he imagined more large-dicks showing up at his house.<br />
<br />
“Sure, half the real men in town are members, and most of us small-dicks,” Roy said as if he was surprised Tyler didn’t know. “Like Scott said, there’s a lot of small-dicks in this town. The Men get to use us to enjoy their big, beautiful dicks, and in return we get a hot meal and to use our bodies for their natural purpose.” He reached over to the kitchen table and picked up his phone, and grinned when he saw the message on the screen. “I invited the new guy from my shop; consider it a little graduation gift from me. He’ll be here in a few minutes.” Roy wagged his eyebrows before getting up to grab himself another beer.</p>
