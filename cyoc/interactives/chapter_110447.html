<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a moment, you decide to do what you had done before, and you look up at Amanda with intent.<br />
<br />
~You will now have absolutely no ability to control your bladder or bowels. You will not even know when you have the need to poop or pee.~<br />
<br />
Long story short, this command set the entire rest of Amanda&#39;s life in motion. A few hours went by and Amanda had wet herself again, as well as made a mess in her pants. This compelled her to put on another diaper.<br />
<br />
This also meant, however, that she was wearing a diaper when her husband finally came home from work at 7:PM, and so she had to explain it to him. He was understanding, but clearly very troubled.<br />
<br />
A few days later, Amanda and her husband--Chris--went to the doctor--with you hanging around in the background--and Amanda was diagnosed with untreatable incontinence. The doc was going to propose solutions like catheters, but you commanded everyone to consider catheters a non-option for her.<br />
<br />
The couple went home, defeated and at least a little depressed. Chris was definitely not happy with this development. Later that evening when Amanda scurried off to the bathroom to change her soaking wet diaper, Chris started to get a little bit angry. He was frankly disgusted.<br />
<br />
That night, the couple laid down on far opposite ends of the bed; nervous to get near each other.<br />
<br />
A couple of days went by, and the sheer quantity of Amanda&#39;s used diapers were starting to become a problem for the house. The smell was getting difficult to manage. The stentch of Amanda&#39;s soiled briefs was making it hard to be comfortable around the house, and they were scared to invite anyone over (except you, of course, who kept stopping by to observe the goings on.)<br />
<br />
After over two weeks, the two of them slowly started to lie down closer and closer to one another in the bed, until eventually they were locked together, as they once had usually been. Chris had spent so much time around Amanda in her diapered state; had so often been sitting next to her <i>knowing</i> she was wet; had many times had a full conversation with her <i>knowing</i> she was messy; had many times had her sitting on his lap and he could feel the surge of warmth or subtle vibration against his crotch... that he could no longer object to holding her in his arms, knowing she was going to have urine all around her privates by the time they woke up.<br />
<br />
However, they still didn&#39;t make love.<br />
Chris wasn&#39;t so much building up a tolerance to Amanda&#39;s new condition, it&#39;s more that he was getting used to the misery and disgust it brought him. He had just resigned himself to accept that his time at home would feature a disturbing smell, and that he would be coming home to a smelly, dirty wife.<br />
<br />
Amanda herself, however, that gotten used to the sickening sensations rather well. It was soon second nature for her to manage her messes and wettings--at least at home. Frankly, the smell didn&#39;t bother her as much any more.<br />
<br />
So before much longer, Amanda&#39;s confidence started to rise back up, and along with it; her sex drive.<br />
One night in particular, Amanda was getting especially frisky with Chris. Under the covers, she was cuddling him and playing around with him in a manner clearly intending to turn him on.<br />
<br />
This, however, only grossed him out more than ever. The suggestive moves his wife was pulling made him snap and decide to leave the bedroom, and sleep on the couch until further notice.<br />
<br />
Amanda, dejected but understanding, pouted as she assembled the covers--now having the bed all to herself.<br />
<br />
The next night, Amanda&#39;s sexual tension had only grown, but she still was alone in the room. Unable to hold herself back, she concluded that she just <i>needed</i> to masturbate, before she loses her mind. She had been unbelievably paranoid about doing that, however, ever since she became incontinent. Her natural instinct would be to stick her right hand down the front of her diaper and do the normal routine from there... but she would prefer to be totally dry before she did that (which she rarely was when going to bed; laying down causes her muscles to relax and let out at least a little), and was very afraid of letting loose on her own hand--resulting in an extremely awkward mess.<br />
<br />
Determined to resolve her problem, she busted out her phone and looked up any information she could on how to masturbate while wearing a diaper.</p>
