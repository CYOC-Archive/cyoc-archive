<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Natalie walked off with Zoey wrapped around her shoulders. Andy had the two as of yet unnamed gymnasts on either side of him. He turned to the brunette on his left. &quot;Jessica! Have you enjoyed the show so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have.&quot; She confirmed. <br />
<br />
Andy then turned to the Asian girl on his right. &quot;How about you Olivia?&quot; She simply nodded in response. &quot;Would you like to help with another trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; They both cheered enthusiastically. Natalie reentered with a strange box. There was a funnel shaped platform, at the bottom was some space that appeared to be two large roller pins like a wringer followed by a small box with an open door to show it was empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now this is based off of the wringer illusion, but with my own personal twist to it.&quot; He pointed at the wringer. &quot;Normally this is on the exit of the box but we have it as apart of the entrance.&quot;<br />
<br />
While he spoke, Natalie had walked off stage and returned with a mannequin head with a red wig that rested in a table. The plastic face looked somewhat familiar to the audience. &quot;Hello Kirsten.&quot; He told it. &quot;How are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
He held up a microphone to the silent plastic head. He then gently tapped it so the audience could hear the hollow echo. &quot;Lights on but nobody&#39;s home.&quot; There were a few chuckles. Natalie left the stage again.<br />
<br />
Andy turned to Jessica. &quot;Jessica, as the captain, do you mind picking one of your team mates to help with this trick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica stared confused at the former fashion major&#39;s head, obviously wondering why Natalie had brought the mannequin back. After realizing Andy had spoken to her she stumbled over her answer. &quot;Uhh.. A-Alexis.&quot; She threw out.<br />
<br />
Andy smiled. &quot;Yes, our favorite blonde.&quot; He turned to the girl who had helped with the trick cups earlier. She made her way up, and had trouble climbing into the funnel. There must have been a platform or something since she seemed to be standing on level ground. The top of the funnel was near her knees.<br />
<br />
Andy ended up helping her into the device. Once she was in he called up to her. &quot;Now Alexis, please be completely honest with us. No judgement, but when you are getting ready for a date, what is the first thing you pick?&quot; A microphone lowered from above. &quot;Make sure to speak into the mic.&quot; He told her.<br />
<br />
She thought about it, not noticing Andy pulling a crank out from behind the box and attach it to the wringer, and closedthe box at the bottom. Finally she leaned towards the hanging mic, lifting slightly as if she had to stand on her toes to reach it. &quot;Panties.&quot; She said shamelessly. <br />
<br />
Andy nodded. &quot;Any favorite designs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; She cried excitedly. &quot;I&#39;ve got these cute hot pink ones with black lace trim. They are sliky and feel great on my-&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Alexis could finish that bit of over sharing,  Andy turned the crank. The already short Alexis became even shorter as she was pulled deeper into the funnel. She gave a cry of surprise that the audience did not need the microphone to hear.  The top of the funnel was now to her mid thighs. <br />
<br />
With another turn she was pulled down to her waist. Another twist, and now the top of the funnel was just below her chest. Alexis held on to the sides to steady herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexis, dear.&quot; Andy called up. &quot;I say we should go ahead and finish your part up, so mind just letting go of the sides and crossing your arms across your chest?&quot; Alexis uncertainly followed his directions. <br />
<br />
Andy turned the crank quickly and Alexis zipped down into the funnel. Pulling off a lock, he opened the funnel to show it was indeed empty. The small box beneath it had to contain Alexis, but the wringers would be too tight for a human to pass through. Andy smiled, knowing Alexis no longer had that problem. <br />
<br />
Opening to previously empty box, a small piece of cloth was now inside. Andy pulled it out to reveal it was a pair of panties, exactly as Alexis described. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, give a big roud of applause for our brave volunteer from the gymnastic team.&quot; <br />
<br />
They cheered as Natalie wheeled out a box that appeared to contain naked mannequin parts. She picked a piece that contained Kristen&#39;s body from her waist to about the top of her knees. The butt faced the audience, showing the audience that the mannequin had a well formed, and very detailed ass. While Natalie held it, Andy stretched out Alexis and pulled the panties onto the mannequin. <br />
<br />
Andy went up to Olivia this time. &quot;As the co-captain, would you mind picking the next volunteer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without hesitation Olivia responded with, &quot;Fatima.&quot; Fatima shot her a look but climbed up to the funnel.<br />
<br />
Andy closed the open funnel and spoke to her. &quot;So, we should finish off the underwear. Would you like to be a matching bra with Alexis?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fatima, being taller, spoke into the microphone with no problem. &quot;I&#39;d rather be a sheer camisole if I have to be underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fancy.&quot; Andy commented. <br />
<br />
&quot;And sexy. If you want to be sexier, you need to start off by feeling sexier.&quot; As she spoke, Natalie was busy assembling the mannequins legs on the stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great advice. One sexy sheer camisole courtesy of our lovely Fatima coming right up. Everyone! Give her a hand for being such a great assistant this evening.&quot; As they cheered, Andy turned the crank a lot quicker then he did for Alexis. Fatima, not expecting this nearly fell as she was pulled down, and flopped on the edge of the funnel, her upper torse hanging over the edge  before she was quickly sucked into the device. <br />
<br />
Andy once again opened up the wringer to show that Fatima was gone and they now had a sheer pink camisole, with a built in bra for support. With the legs assembled, Natalie brought over the torso, which included shoulders and arms up to the elbows. Andy struggled a bit but got the camisole on it. Natalie went to attach the top to the mannequin legs still standing. <br />
<br />
Andy returned to the captain. &quot;Now Jessica, we are back to you. Just three members left, who will help is dress our mannequin next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Olivia!&quot; She announced. Olivia seemed shocked but Jessica just laughed. &quot;Oh don&#39;t give me that. You know you were gonna say me next anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliva sighed and went up to the wringer. &quot;Now Olivia,&quot; Andy started. &quot;Are you a top or bottom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without thinking she responded. &quot;Bottom. Wait no-&quot; she was quickly pulled into the device as Andy cranked faster then the first two. Once finished, he pulled out a short black skirt, which Natalie fit onto the mannequin. It seemed to a tighter fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we need a top. What better top then the top of our gymnastics team, Jessica!&quot; Realizing she held on to her humanity as long as she could, Jessica climbed up and was soon turned into a dark blue top which proved to give just a hint of the mannequins plastic cleavage. <br />
<br />
Now all that remained of the gymnastics team was Kylie. With the mannequin dressed, Natalie attached the arms, and Kristen&#39;s head. Her shoes from the fashion shoe was still on as Natalie couldn&#39;t get them off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure your wondering why you are up here.&quot; Andy told her. Standing there in her gymnastics leotard, Kylie nodded. &quot;Well mostly, I have a thing for red heads and I like standing on stage with three of them. Even if Kristen is a little stiff from stage fright.&quot;<br />
<br />
He waited for a chuckle that never came. &quot;Okay, that one bombed. Worth a try.&quot; Natalie pulled a large blanket from the box that had held the mannequin parts. &quot;Kylie, I&#39;d like you to help Natalie cover Kristen with this. Be careful with the wig. She was sensitive about it earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie and Kylie arranged the large blanket to cover the mannequin,  with the edges laid neatly on the floor. Natalie stood to the left side of the stage with Kylie on the right.<br />
<br />
Andy walked up, and lifted up the edge of the cloth. &quot;Ready?&quot; With a short pause he pulled of the cloth, slinging it over Kylie, revealing a completely restored Kristen in her new outfit. <br />
<br />
Kristen seemed confused, looking at her outfit. Remember what happened earlier she quickly reached up to make sure she had hair. The audience laughed. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie came to her side. &quot;I&#39;ll show you the recording later. Trust me, you will love it.&quot; She guided Kristin off the stage.<br />
<br />
Noticing that Kylie was still under the blanket, Andy walked up to her. &quot;Uh...Kylie... this tricks done. You can go now.&quot; When there was no response, not even any movement, Andy pulled the blanket off of her. <br />
<br />
Underneath was a mannequin in Kylie&#39;s leotard, with a shock expression painted on her face. &quot;Oh. Well, I guess we still have a mannequin.&quot; Andy said pretending to be surprised. He looked off to the side where Natalie had left. &quot;Well, I guess Kylie can stay with us for a bit longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
He left her where she was as he came closer for the next trick</p>
