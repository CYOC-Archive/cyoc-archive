<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before going to second period, Dan stopped by the bathroom. His face felt irritated and he wanted to see why. <br />
<br />
“Am I really that embarrassed? My face is so red!” Dan told himself. <br />
<br />
Dan’s face looked like a solid color of red, more red than he has ever seen before on a face. And the texture of his skin looked different too. It looked pretty soft, so he put his hands to his face, and sure enough. His skin was way more softer than normal. <br />
<br />
He left the bathroom hiding his head, and hoping none of his friends saw this. <br />
<br />
Luckily for Dan, none of his friends were in his second period. He thought about going to the hospital, but for some reason everytime he tried to leave, his body wouldn’t let him. So he continued with school. Oddly enough, his teacher didn’t send him home or to the doctor. In fact, nobody seemed to think he was sick. Though he did get some stares from some of the prettier girls in class. <br />
<br />
His third period had Holly in his class. She sat next to him and said, “Wow, Dan. The floral pattern on you looks cute. Lilly is going to love taking you to the party with it!”<br />
<br />
Dan touched his face, and noticed that it wasn’t completely smooth everywhere anymore, though it was in some places. He did find out what Holly meant by “floral pattern.” It seemed like parts of his skin formed some kinds of fabric flowers sprinkled on his face, and he could see some of it reach down into his neck. <br />
<br />
Despite this, Holly didn’t really find it weird, or address it further. They spent the rest of the period without really talking to each other. <br />
<br />
At the end of the period, Dan’s entire head, and some of his neck and chest started to feel numb, and he was fairly lightheaded. He was getting very worried, but for some reason, he kept on going through the day. <br />
<br />
After third period, Dan bumped into Kat. <br />
<br />
“So Dan, I’m so excited to see the progress on your transformation!” Kat said gleefully. Then she took a long look at Dan and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Kat, what is happening to me?” Dan asked, fearfully. <br />
<br />
“I told you this morning. You are becoming your inner self. I can’t quite yet tell what that is, but I think you aren’t going to stay animate very long.” Kat said. <br />
<br />
“Am I going to die?”<br />
<br />
“At the moment, yes. But Mom asked me to alter the spell real quickly, so when you do transform, your soul, thoughts, memories, and even senses remain. So let me do that real quick…”<br />
<br />
Dan didn’t get a chance to think this over. Kat immediately tapped Dan on the face with a stick, causing his lightheadedness to go away. <br />
<br />
“There. Can’t wait to see you at my party! If you can’t move there, magic will find a way,” Kat winked. <br />
<br />
Nobody was in any of Dan’s classes until lunch. <br />
<br />
Dan, Kyle, Max, Holly and Lilly all sat together for lunch. Dan didn’t grab any food, because he wasn’t hungry. To be honest, at that point, he wasn’t sure if he even had a stomach. His body just seemed almost flat. None of the others commented on Dan’s state. However, Dan did feel this huge urge to hug Lilly. <br />
<br />
After lunch Dan and Lilly walked to class together. Dan noticed that he shrunk a lot, to the point where he was even smaller than Lilly. <br />
<br />
“Lilly, do you think there is something wrong with me?” Dan finally asked. <br />
<br />
“Nope, you are perfect for the party. You are going to look great with me.”Lilly said, smiling. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know if I can come, now.”<br />
<br />
“I know you have your sister’s party. But I’m sure you can show up for a couple of minutes at the beginning. I’ll even come with you, if you want.”<br />
<br />
Lilly’s last sentence came out a bit different. It was as if she was forced to say it. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess. I think Kat will want you there,” Dan said. Similar to Lilly, he didn’t really try to say it. It was as if the words just came out on there own. <br />
<br />
Lilly spent the rest of the class admiring Dan’s appearance. By then end of class, he was even shorter. His neck also seemed to have disappeared, with his head level with his chest. <br />
<br />
Dan didn’t have any more classes with anyone until the last period, where he was with Max. <br />
<br />
Max didn’t even acknowledge Dan’s existence during class. Even when Dan tried to talk, Max didn’t listen. In fact, neither did Dan’s teacher. After passing out graded tests, the teacher skipped over Dan. When Dan asked her about it, she ignored him as if he wasn’t there. <br />
<br />
After school, Dan struggled to walk home. The transformation was very subtle, and he couldn’t feel many of the changes when they were happening, but there was no doubt that he came out of the school completely different than from when he walked in. He was as small as a small child, thin to the point where he questioned if he even still had bones anymore, and a solid color of red fabric for skin with flower patterns sticking out. <br />
<br />
The closer that Dan got to his house, the more some changes happened. Dan’s head sunk down even further, with a v-like indent on the top of his head. Soon, his clothes, which had changed and remained on him throughout the day started to wither away. Then he struggled to even walk, as the gap between his thighs started to shrink, and eventually merge, consuming his private parts in the process. While most changes felt subtle, this one was the most apparent. It felt like a tight towel wrapped around his legs and squeezed harder and harder and harder. His knees were next to start merging. <br />
<br />
Because his movement was restricted, Dan moved really slowly. He wasn’t even halfway to his house, and he was practically crawling with only 15 minutes until his sister’s party. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt himself effortlessly picked up. His body seemed to wrap and hang from a woman’s arm. He realized at this point how small and flat he really was. <br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, he was at his house. During that time, Dan felt like his legs, which were combined into one, started to split again, but from a different direction. The fabric that consumed the top part seemed to be tulle, and spread up until where Dan’s hips were. The bottom part was the same fabric as the rest of his body. <br />
<br />
“Hold on, I have to get ready,” said a familiar voice. Was that Lilly’s? <br />
<br />
Lilly took off her dress she was wearing and walked in. <br />
<br />
Dan couldn’t see much, but you could tell that the party at your house was unlike any Dan has ever seen. He could hear music he has never heard before, chatter from female members of his family as they were casting spells. The glimpses he had from male family members appeared to be much more different than he was used to seeing. They were mythological and fantasy creatures as opposed to being the humans Dan thought they were.</p>
