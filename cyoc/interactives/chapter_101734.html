<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen arrived at the high school she taught at at exactly 7:30. It was quite a large school and had a lot of students almost 2000. Karen was quite new at the school having only taught their for just over a year after she quit teaching in a daycare. <br />
<br />
She opened the door and went to the classroom where she taught all of her lessons. It was quite a small room, this was because she taught relatively small classes of around 25 people. But she liked it, it had all she needed. She dumped her bag and paperwork on her desk. And left for the teachers lounge. She had never been this early before so she was eager to see who was at school this early. She hadn&#39;t seen any students yet other than the odd freshman. And she had only seen one teacher: Mr Yang, an elderly Asian gentleman who taught math. He looked surprised to see her so early  but smiled and greeted her politely.<br />
<br />
Karen opened the door to the teachers lounge and walked in when her greatest fears were realised. The only two staff there were Miss Rose and Mr Dennis both of whom, for whatever reason seriously disliked her. Miss Rose was a middle aged Science teacher, who was short, round and ugly to be frank. And Mr Dennis, who was also an English teacher. Frankly just didn&#39;t like her teaching style. <br />
<br />
Safe to say she got out of there as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
Her first few lessons went by fine. No hiccups, she did catch one boy ogling her though. It was when she reached her fourth and final lesson of the day that things went wrong. <br />
<br />
It was senior English. And she was giving out those papers she had &quot;graded&quot; last night. She had read through them at lunch. Mostly they were good, however two of them had been exceptionally bad. Both receiving Fs and both of whom were problem students. <br />
<br />
Susie Jane and Ben Green. As the class started to enter the room she told them not to sit down as she wanted to change the seating plan. <br />
<br />
Other than a few mild changes she moved Susie next to a girl named Pyrrha at the front of the class and Ben next to a girl named Holly a row behind.<br />
<br />
Karen handed out the papers and got to Susie. On her paper was a post it note that read &quot;See me after class&quot;. Ben&#39;s read the same. She had purposefully sat the two of them next to the top two students in the class. She knew they wouldn&#39;t improve because of this  but it was more in an attempt to embarrass them.<br />
<br />
She even overheard Susie asking Pyrrha what she got on  her paper and Pyrrha just replying shyly with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... A plus, you?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Karen smirked at that. <br />
<br />
The rest of the lesson went on as planned. She had to break up a small argument between two girls at the back of the class but otherwise everything was fine. <br />
<br />
The bell rang 45 minutes later and everyone left to go home. Karen merely waited at her desk for Susie and Ben to come to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right then, Susie you can sit for a minute whilst I talk to Ben.&quot;<br />
<br />
Susie did as instructed and sat down.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What are your goals in life Ben? Tell me what<br />
you have planned for your future.&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Well Miss Fisher. When our<br />
football team wins the state championship this year, I expect to be<br />
awarded a Scholarship to a major University. Then after playing there a<br />
couple of years to build up my stats and reputation, I&#39;m sure the NFL<br />
will draft me. That will make my life long dream come true.&quot; He replied<br />
with a smile.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I see. So you have your entire future planned out based on<br />
your athletic ability. Is that correct?&quot; She asked. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; He<br />
answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;re facing an enormous problem that is about to upset your apple<br />
cart. You&#39;re not passing my English course Ben. Do you realise if you<br />
have a failing grade at the end of this quarter, you won&#39;t be allowed to<br />
play football? Then your dreams go down the drain.&quot; She told him.<br />
<br />
 &quot;That&#39;s<br />
n ot a problem Miss Fisher. Just give me a C. The other teachers do it<br />
for me.&quot; He responded<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes Derek, I know they do. But that&#39;s not the way<br />
I operate. You&#39;re a troubled young man Derek. You&#39;ve been placed in<br />
detention for smoking in the bathroom and bullying the other students.<br />
And if I&#39;m not mistaken, you were charged with vandalism for tearing down<br />
the Flag pole last week and are currently on probation. Any other student<br />
would have received harsh punishments for those acts. But they take it<br />
easy on you because you&#39;re a star player on the varsity football team. I<br />
refuse to coddle you that way Derek. If you flunk English, you&#39;ll be<br />
expelled from the team. It&#39;s that simple.&quot; She stated.<br />
<br />
YOU CAN&#39;T DO THAT!&quot; He screamed as he jumped to his feet<br />
<br />
<br />
.<br />
 &quot;Yes Ben I<br />
can. And I will if you don&#39;t earn a passing grade and behave yourself in<br />
my class.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Come on Miss Fisher. A football player doesn&#39;t have to know<br />
how to write essays. And what difference does it make if he doesn&#39;t know<br />
a noun from a pro noun or a verb from an adverb. All he has to do is keep<br />
his body in shape and run down the field for long gains. The team can&#39;t<br />
win the state championship without me. And I won&#39;t earn a Scholarship if<br />
I don&#39;t play. So you have to reconsider and give me a C.&quot; He pleaded.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ben, that&#39;s not possible. I recommend you come to my house tonight and well start some private tutoring sessions. With miss Jane here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Susie questioned from her seat s she looked up from her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes Susie you have a similar problem. You&#39;re failing my class, I need to know what you&#39;re going to do about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my daddy is the mayor of the town.&quot; Susie stated smugly. &quot;And money buys everything,&quot; she smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well money can&#39;t buy you...&quot; Karen said as she was cut off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Money buys everything,&quot; Susie said sternly.<br />
<br />
The silver ring on Karen&#39;s finger had been glowing for sometime now. And she could feel a swelling come over her.</p>
