<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gym class would end as usual after about forty five minutes, with Deion watching Dave for a little bit to see what was going on there and if he saw or even noticed anything. However he didn&#39;t do so for very long - after all, it seemed whatever was happening with Dave, it was much slower and much more gradual than the changes that turned him black. It was at that point he kind of realized he was now thinking of himself more as Deion than as Alec, and just figured he should focus on what he needed to do this weekend.<br />
<br />
He still ended up, as he started changing out of his gym clothes, looking over at Dave, who seemed to still be mirthfully unaware, or if anything even enjoying what was happening to him. Dave asked him, &quot;What? You like how I look now? Gonna check me out right here?&quot; He said in a rather taunting voice, though it didn&#39;t take much listening to hear the underlying sheer libido there.<br />
<br />
As the other students filtered out through the door, Deion finally answered him, &quot;Dude, as much as it may astound you, I am just not that into you. Seriously, can you not even see what&#39;s happening to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me? I&#39;m fucking hot that&#39;s what. I dunno what&#39;s going on right now, but if it makes me feel this hot, this strong, this horny...I just can&#39;t see it as anything really bad.&quot; He punctuated that by groping his groin, and Deion watched Dave slip on his shirt and then start heading out. It was pretty clear to him that Dave was riding a power high right now. And it was just a matter of when this would change him a little too much for him to be comfortable with.<br />
<br />
As Deion finished up getting dressed and headed out to go to the next class, he thought about what brought on Dave&#39;s changes.<br />
<br />
It seemed whatever happened to him was spread through that kind of contact. He cupped his chin and tried to think about how it all went down, but his brainstorming on a piece of paper was interrupted by the teacher announcing a pop quiz. Deion circled a few phrases on the piece of paper before putting it away. True to form, considering this was biology and even as Alec he hadn&#39;t been good at it, Deion felt kind of lost as the quiz went underway.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Dave meanwhile was trying to engage with the class he was in, but he kept getting interrupted by his own body. His usual clothes, a stringer top, a jock jacket, and jeans, were now much tighter on him than they usually were due to his recent growth, and due to the tightness... he looked down at the bulge in his crotch. For fucks sakes, he thought to himself. He had just taken care of himself in the locker room just a period ago before PE. He blamed Deion for getting him all excited, thinking about his recent gains.<br />
<br />
Nobody would dare assume anything about Dave, but even though he fucked a huge share of women here, he had also found just since last year he&#39;d developed something of a taste for the more muscular men. And few men here were more muscular than Deion Dalton. Fuck, Dave thought, I want to bang him so fucking much. If he&#39;d just fucking let me.<br />
<br />
Roiling in his sexual frustration, Dave eventually put his hand up and asked to use the restroom. He was already up and moving when the teacher excused him. Of course she excused him. It was fucking Dave asking.<br />
<br />
He quickly headed into the same stall as usual in the same bathroom as before, breathing and, rather than merely push his pants down, outright stripped naked to enjoy himself. Dave took a moment to flex and preen, bringing up one rugged, muscular bicep to his lips and he kissed the muscle, making his cock tremble.<br />
<br />
Dave knew he was so worked up it wouldn&#39;t take him much time at all to come, but he wanted to draw this out. To really enjoy his muscled physique and hopefully go the rest of the day without another episode like this. He flexed his pecs, rubbing those tiny nipples and feeling spikes of pleasure flying through him. He ran his hands eagerly up and down his torso, touching each individual abdominal muscle. Dave was on cloud 9...!<br />
<br />
He shifted between individual flexing poses, his manhood bobbing and letting out small rivulets of precum, his desperate arousal tangible in the air. Dave could smell the sheer heat his body was generating. He knew this was gonna be a big one. So he went for it, at long last. He wrapped one hand around his cock, almost falling to his knees from the sensation. And then he gripped his balls with the other hand...and he stroked.<br />
<br />
All of one stroke was all it took.<br />
<br />
Dave suppressed a scream of sheer erotic joy, feeling a massive orgasm flash through his body, everything feeling like it was firing at full cylinders. He sprayed the toilet seat, the wall behind the toilet, and the inside with wave after wave of the most intense orgasm he&#39;d ever felt in his life. He spent a moment pressing his wide back against the door to the stall, grinning like a fool. It took about a minute after that for him to finally get himself back up and moving. He got his clothes back on and went out to look at himself...<br />
<br />
...and he saw his &quot;awesome tan&quot; looked just slightly deeper. And even though his face hadn&#39;t changed much if at all that time, Dave was able to see the slightly wider than usual nose and oh so slightly thicker lips. He looked around, trying to think of something to say or do, but he was caught. Right between the fact he absolutely loved his muscles and his looks, and the fact he could almost sort of recognize where this was going.<br />
<br />
Worry flashed through his mind, a thought, a wonder about whether this was going where his mind was telling him it might be.<br />
<br />
Dave shook his head and glared at the mirror, &quot;No...no! It isn&#39;t, it won&#39;t! I know I&#39;m a white guy. I&#39;m not gonna be some black man like Deion. I&#39;m never...it...it just can&#39;t be. People don&#39;t just change races. It doesn&#39;t work like that.&quot; Reinforcing his own mentality of himself, Dave marched out of there. Deciding that it couldn&#39;t be that. It just couldn&#39;t be.<br />
<br />
After all, he was getting so ripped and huge. How could it be leading somewhere he didn&#39;t want it to go?<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
After school, Deion was just about to head home when he noticed a few of his old friends trailing him. Spencer, Silas, Lucas and Zane. The first was a self styled intellectual who Deion knew from his time as Alec carefully kept locked away the fact he was a thoroughly rabid racist, angry about just about everything. Silas and Lucas were Spencer&#39;s &quot;security&quot; - a pair of muscular guys who always hanged out together, and Zane...Deion distinctly remembered rather tubby, hairy, somewhat disturbed Zane being kind of the follower of the bunch.<br />
<br />
As Deion waited at the light to cross the road, Spencer and his goons circled him and the leader of their number stepped forward.<br />
<br />
Spencer was always a rather ratty looking young man. Not particularly handsome, chubby in the face, and even when he tried to get fit, it just resulted in him looking more stocky than anything else. His greasy black hair was styled back in a full on Hitler combover. Evidently white supremacy did not include supremacy in hair style and dress. Because Spencer insisted on wearing clothes people from the fifties would call old-fashioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve...had a remarkably privileged run about this school, Mr. Dalton,&quot; Spencer stated. He gestured to his partners, who flared out around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Deion responded, &quot;It&#39;s pretty ironic for you guys to try and bring up that point. I mean, your daddy bein&#39; a judge means you literally have all the say in the world what justice is around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, touche, touche, my &quot;nigga&quot;.&quot; Spencer seemed to teeter at the thought of violating that kind of word use privilege, &quot;But being as it may, I just cannot STAND to see you swaggering all over the place, basking in that unearned adoration...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe it&#39;s 20-fucking-20, and everyone&#39;s done falling in line with you,&quot; Deion responded, and indeed even if he got to turn back into Alec, he was gonna be more than done with Spencer and his gang of throwbacks. This was really unmasking what these guys were all about - they weren&#39;t about heritage. They were about hate, fear and displacement fantasies.<br />
<br />
Spencer looked around and saw more students approaching, leaning in and saying in a distinctly dark tone, &quot;We are going to figure out who you are, and where you came from, you hood rat. I bet you&#39;ve got a bunch of sobbing baby-mammas at home.&quot; And with that, Spencer gestured and his followers ran off with him.<br />
<br />
Deion breathed and finally, finally, the crossing light changed, letting him go. Deion went off home, but felt distinctly shaken somehow by that whole exchange. Spencer and his goons had definitely shown him this part of the experience of his new race. Even as Deion mused about returning to being Alec, he couldn&#39;t help but think he needed to do something either way. He couldn&#39;t just let these guys continue with their nonsense.<br />
<br />
As he got home he saw a stack of new books from Amazon on the patio, bringing them indoors with him. He perused them once he was safe and secure indoors, examining the texts for any way to change him back. And as usual, it seemed the means were distinctly ritualistic and probably less than useful...<br />
<br />
That night he as usual hit the gym, showered, and then headed off to bed. Thinking about all the topics that had come up recently - Kayla, Dave, Savannah, and now the goon squad.</p>
