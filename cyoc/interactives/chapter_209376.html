<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are working at a cool shop in the human world. You are an elf from the fay world and having obtained your denomination as a sorceress, you are quite excited at hiding with a warlock like Merlin within the human world and passing as one. Merlin is a cool boss and he enjoys his job immensely. That much is obvious. You laugh inwardly as you imagine the effects of the different costumes on the various buyers. And problematic for them. In the fay world, it would be nothing at all. <br />
As you sort out the racks of different accessories, you hear the door open with its little bell. A customer? At this hour? Not usual but not impossible either. Unless... Unless it is a previous customer who is finding himself in quite a pickle... That should be delightfully entertaining and funny to see. And of course you&#39;d help. As much as you can. Supposedly. So you go look near the entryway discreetly and you refrain from laughing. Because the sight is worthy of it. You do feel bad for that poor hapless human. You will help him out, with Merlin&#39;s assistance and advice, yet it is true that he looks a bit ridiculous in that trench coat and hat. Ironically, he looks a hundred times more suspicious than with his satyr body, which can pass as an elaborate costume, as it was meant to be originally. But the poor young human is clearly desperate and out of touch with his new nature. Ironic as well, when looking at young male humans. Well, you decide to not let him stew in his grief and misery longer.<br />
&quot;Are you all right? May I help you?&quot; you ask in a soft voice.<br />
No one has ever seemed as relieved to lay eyes on you, ever, as this youngster.<br />
&quot;Yes! Please!&quot; he exclaimed, frightened yet relieved. &quot;This costume! It&#39;s... It sounds crazy but it&#39;s stuck on me! I&#39;m a satyr! An actual satyr! And... And... And I want sex! I...&quot;<br />
He blustered and stammered, clearly distressed. Nothing very surprising for you, though and you hurry in reassuring him.<br />
&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll help you. I know what is happening.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; he said, hope making his eyes shine.<br />
&quot;All that you are feeling is absolutely normal.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... For a satyr, I mean,&quot; you amend. &quot;Just let me examine you in one of the changing rooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
He follows you and he undresses in the changing room, finally getting off that horridly stupid and ugly trench coat and hat. You examine him and he must feel towards you as he would a nurse. You see that indeed the costume fused to this young man&#39;d body incredibly well, intimately... and fast. He has become satyr-like, including in mind, in a very short time. It should take at least a good few days for a human, normally. From what he says of his party, the effects of the costume spread incredibly fast. Maybe Merlin can provide an explanation. Naturally, the new satyr, in the last part of the examination, is very reluctant in showing his erection and privates. His bleating, which burst out of his control, also concerns him greatly. He explains that his erection is much bigger than usual and his testicles really look swollen. What would be a source of pride, in other circumstances, has become a source of distress. You explain that apart from the fact that he was a human not too long ago, he looks like a perfectly healthy satyr.<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to be a satyr! Change me back! Merlin should know!&quot; he exclaims, anguished and letting out a series of bleats that he is powerless to halt.<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; you explain. &quot;At once. I have to admit this is a bit out of my league. I have ideas to help you, but only as a satyr. I have no idea how to change you back. Only to make you comfortable in your new shape. A better shape, I might add.&quot;<br />
The satyr glowers at you.<br />
&quot;Please just go get Merlin. And your hands near my balls and dick makes me horny. Made me even more horny. So if you don&#39;t want to get raped just fucking go NOW!&quot;<br />
His sweating and panting are understandable and he does not know that if he did try to be untoward to you, a spell would calm him down in an instant. Castration, age regression, doused in icy water,... The possibilities would be endless. But you still go because that poor human is clearly distressed.<br />
<br />
You find Merlin rather easily and explain the issue to him. He does not appear surprised. He saw you attempting to deal with the problem and he agrees with you. There&#39;s not much your capacities can do. Not for now, at least. Merlin enters the changing room and calls the young man Mark. He confirms that a Mark is a healthy strapping young satyr at the peak of satyr capacities. He also explains and speculates that the costume had increased effects, incredibly faster, because the party was a frat party so the potential level of sex, promiscuity, alcoholic drinks and revelry tapped right into the natures of satyrs, thereby increasing its powers. Merlin does think that the costume will relinquish its hold upon Mark if he can resist the urges it imposes upon him until sunrise. Or else he will remain a satyr for ever. In short, if he can refrain from having sex, ejaculating or pleasuring himself, he would get his humanity back. Of course, Mark was appalled. His erection was already a nightmare to leave on its own! Pre-cum was already leaking! How was he supposed to last until sunrise? It was impossible! His urges were getting impossible to ignore and more demanding by the moment! Merlin simply said that he would leave Mark alone in the changing room as the youngster attempted the impossible.<br />
<br />
Mark lasted one hour, which was a lot more than Merlin or yourself had expected. Merlin and yourself heard a cry of relief mingled with horror and the subsequent panting indicating that Mark had been unable to stop relieving himself. Considering the size of his erection and level of arousal, it was not surprising at all. When Merlin and yourself came to the changing room, the warlock opened the door with a wave of his hand and inside, Mark was sweating, panting and with his penis still in hand. Her belly had become paunchier and hairier.<br />
&quot;I tried... I... I tried to rub it on the carpet and but the rough material made it worse... I thought...&quot;<br />
He started sobbing.<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;m going to stay a goat guy forever...&quot; he cried.<br />
&quot;For a satyr, I believe you are very handsome,&quot; you tried to console him truthfully. &quot;You shall be very popular with ladies of mythology.&quot;<br />
Merlin waved to the cleaning closet so that a mop and a bucket of cleaning products arrived to wash away Mark&#39;s unhygienic mess. Mark did not seem to hear your words, so Merlin tried on another tack.<br />
&quot;The task was near impossible. Do not blame yourself. But keep in mind that being a satyr isn&#39;t that bad for you. Why did you join that college fraternity?&quot;<br />
&quot;To... To party. To stay with buddies. To drink. To have sex with girls,&quot; Mark said truthfully and making you scowl in disgust. <br />
But for Mark, why lie? His life as he knew it is over for good.<br />
&quot;Not really a sports, educative or scholarly fraternities like they used to be,&quot; flatly says Merlin. &quot;Your motives for joining a frat are unworthy at best but can be excusable as a satyr. A satyr is undisputedly the best form for you. And as a satyr, you will just be following your instincts. Your basest instincts, but without the morality expected of human beings. After all, no one expects a satyr to behave any differently. You are simply being liberated from your moral prison.&quot;<br />
&quot;But... But... My life...&quot;<br />
&quot;You cannot live in the human world. That much is obvious. I&#39;ll send you in the fay world. New blood is always welcome.&quot;<br />
&quot;To do what?&quot; asks Mark despondently.   <br />
The answer is obvious to you and Merlin but apparently it still needs to be explained.<br />
&quot;To revel in drink and party. To have intercourse with nymphs and female fauns. And women. Lots of women. And wine. You can drink wine all night long and fall asleep snoring afterwards. Your life shall be an incarnation of fun and merry-making and pleasures enjoyed by all. Is that so bad? It is like your frat life but more interesting and a lot more authentic.&quot;<br />
Mark seemed to think about it. If this was true, well... It did seem pleasant. Extremely pleasant, even. All the benefits of frat life with no classes or grades or cops. And both these people seemed to agree that he was a satyr hottie. Then, all girls would be on him and his new set of privates would be fun to put to good use. It made him smirk in heavenly anticipation. Music, grapes and sweet wine could be mingled with beer and dancing amongst the maenads and centaurs and all these creatures of old would never get tiring. Art would practiced. He could learn music and dance and invite delicious nymphs with their soft skin, perky buttocks and pert little bosoms. Just the thought of those females or indeed the massive sheaths of male centaurs made him feel a new pool of warmth in his groin as well as his testicles swelling with gametes in anticipation, leading his penis to stiffen again. All to his thoughts, Mark did not notice his new desires and instincts as a satyr invade his human thoughts, altering his mind. They were close enough to his frat pledge psyche, meaning their intrusion was all the more insidious and rapid. He just had new tastes, though and his personality was the same. His human past life would just be forgotten as annoying and uninteresting. He would be preoccupied with other more immediate urges. His human past did resurface one last time, though.<br />
&quot;But... The... The others...? In the other costumes?...&quot;<br />
Merlin smiled.<br />
&quot;Oh, them? They&#39;ll manage with their costumes. Or not. It shall depends on what they&#39;ve chosen and how they manage. Or what they decide to do. And what I decide upon doing. You decided not to give in to abuse others. You are just the product of what young human males are taught to do and like. So I decide to let you go easy. This is a store to delve poetic justice, rewards and punishments. Meet yours, Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
A month later, Mark was now a satyr indulging willingly and with a full heart into his new life. In the fay world, he lived in a perpetual Mediterranean spring and summer environment. He was very much appreciated of both females and males and he saw no problems in playing both ways. Experimenting between partners was fun! Consent was primordial, naturally, but each one developed their own tastes. There was always someone to agree to what you wanted to do at a certain moment. Everyone lived fully and let live. Wine was plentiful and the food filling and delicious. A satyr had a paunchy belly to show off his lust for life and his convivial personality. It showed he loved food and everyone&#39;s cooking. Appreciation given to all cooks! Showing off his privates was not considered vulgar anymore. On the contrary, it showed he loved the bodies of others and perpetuating the fay species. And centaurs, nymphs, other satyrs, maenads and other beings were great companions! At times he wondered what had happened to the other pledges in their costumes, the other frat boys or other customers of Merlin&#39;s shop and if he would meet any of them here, but these stray thoughts were far between and less and less imposing. Merlin had been right. He was much happier than before as a satyr. Why ponder on bad memories when he had new blissful ones to create right here?</p>
