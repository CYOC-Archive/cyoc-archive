<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">However, just when he thought the coast was clear, he heard some sounds off in the distance, like a couple drunk guys laughing and joking. He was a bully, sure, but he was not stupid enough to think he could take a couple drunk bikers. There was no way he would be able to outrun them and pass the bike off as his own. Regardless how much he wanted it, it wasn&#39;t worth life and limb. So he kept moving, and watched several guys walk past - some bigger than he was now. As Will walked off, he did not pay any further note to the strange circumstances. Almost like things were arranging themselves before him, for some reason. It somewhat reminded him of contrived coincidences in weird curse movies.<br />
<br />
He vaguely remembered some little brat, and the piece of paper, but he decided that he could deal with the brat any time he pleased now. Even though he had some gray in his hair, he was a man. Flexing his biceps with glee, Will decided that whatever was causing this was only making him stronger, bigger, more of a MAN.<br />
<br />
However as he raised his arms, he felt a cold chill. Yeah, looked like it was getting cold now. He breathed out and a cloud of white formed in front of his mouth. He needed to find a room, regardless whether it was high or low quality.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t scared of the thugs or drifters who came out at the later hours, heck, he looked and fought like one of them. It was more of a comfort necessity.<br />
<br />
So off he went, looking for a room.<br />
<br />
It did not take very long before he found a little hole in the wall motel - very rudimentary looking, and the front desk manned by a large, middle aged woman who brightened up as soon as he came in.<br />
<br />
She winked at him, &quot;Hello, handsome, welcome to Manfred&#39;s Motel...can I get you a room? We have a bar and other accommodations, especially for a big strong man like you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Will felt like he wanted to vomit, this woman had bad cigarette smoke wafting off of her, not at all high class stuff like what he had used, but more &quot;dime store cast offs&quot;. Well, even so, he had some use for her, &quot;Well, I am in a bit of trouble, and you know, if I&#39;m out of it by tomorrow, I might be able to give you a lot more payment than what you&#39;d get tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still a thirteen year old in the head.<br />
<br />
However, his charm apparently worked. She became alight, and grinned, &quot;Oh handsome you speak my language...you can pay for the room tomorrow in any way you like. Rest up for it, though...&quot;<br />
<br />
Another wink, and she handed him his key, getting up and waddling over to give it to him, together with a wet little kiss on the cheek. Even if she was ugly looking, she was still a woman, he tried to tell himself. So tomorrow, he would get some kind of pleasant reward. If only theoretically pleasant.<br />
<br />
When Will got to his room, he opened the door with the key, though it took a number of times in order to get through. Evidently the locks were faulty here too.<br />
<br />
As he entered his room, Will locked the door behind him, again after a few tries, and thought, drunk as he was, about all that went well this night. He got to second base, he got his first drink, won his first fight against that bastard Tony...yeah, he&#39;d need to finish that some day. Tony, even to Will, was a rat bastard.<br />
<br />
It did not take too long for his thoughts to linger on the second base portion of the night&#39;s events. He started to feel strange, a lurid sensation creeping up inside of him. Well, he was in his thirties now, so it was only a matter of time. Will decided to see what kind of body he had to deal with, among other things, stripping off his shirt and chuckling to himself. He made a double bicep pose, oh...yeah...<br />
<br />
His muscular, thick body definitely pleased him - if aging got him this far, he had to wonder how further this could go, and how much better it&#39;d look and feel. He felt...looked...like a big, tough thug who nobody would mess with.<br />
<br />
The sensation kept on, and he looked down at his tented pants. &quot;Ah, I get it...I grew up so much, &#39;course I&#39;m a bit horny. Didn&#39;t get to let the steam out with Sasha or Sue earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
He HAD to get this done, or there&#39;d be no chance of getting any rest tonight. Sliding his pants down, he took in his endowment. &quot;Hoo...definitely all grown up. I have gotta try it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Will grasped his immodest organ in his hand, and groaned almost instantly. Hard...there was no way around doing this. Up and down went his hand across his meat, eliciting joyful cries from his mouth. He had never known anything like this. If it really felt this good now...this was no curse. It was making him bigger, manlier, and it felt so...damn...good...<br />
<br />
Groaning loudly as he worked himself, Will did not notice his curse activating again. He started to become bigger again, once again gaining in force of girth and stout strength. Lines on his forehead becoming more visible, hairline retreating a small amount yet again. Hair thinned an almost imperceptible bit on the back of his head. His beard grew thicker, the ink of his tattoos becoming more faded.<br />
<br />
His stamina poor - he was only a thirteen year old in mind after all - he finally erupted, and he groaned, his voice gravelly and deep, &quot;Haa...at least that sated me for a little while.&quot; He did not even bother to clean up his mess.<br />
<br />
He did not even notice his further changes, as he had further things on his mind...</p>
