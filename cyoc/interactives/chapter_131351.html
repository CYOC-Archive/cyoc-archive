<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-Sei-<br />
<br />
Void. Sei felt it. This spiralling nothingness. She couldn’t escape from the water’s high gradient. She was slipping and falling into the void. Her ears were bleeding, her nose was bleeding, He eyes were bleeding. But then the gradient seemed to lessen, it came easier to climb. She wiped the blood from her face and battled against the odds and climbed away from the void.<br />
<br />
She awoke. <br />
<br />
She could hear ringing…but also something else…a name…it seemed to echo in her mind “Sei…Sei…SEI!!”. She was shot back to reality. She was hanging from the wall. She looked around, the room was falling apart, but she could see It was some sort of underground laboratory. Sei saw vials of strange compounds on the table, she tried to read them but her vision was blurry.<br />
<br />
She then remembered. She was absorbed by that piano. She thought she was going to die. But she was oka- Her thoughts were broken off, by pain which seemed to form in her chest. She reached for it for the shackles stopped her. She was confused because the pain then went away. <br />
<br />
But it strikes back. Sei screamed in pain, as her chest violently pushed outwards and then back in. She looked down at the epicentre of the attack and saw her chest was changing colour to a dark black. She tried pulling her hands from the shackles, but then to her surprise they broke off. She wondered if they broke off due to the oldness of the room or her changing body. <br />
<br />
After her hands were free she brought them to her chest. She coughed violently “Oh…god…what is happening to me” she said slowly. Her chest was now completely black, but the flesh seemed to change as well to something more wooden and hollow. Her organs transfigured and stretched out. She lay on the ground in torture. But then her arms started changing. They twitched, and she heard bones the bones crunch. Her arms were getting thinner and started changing to the same medium as her chest. <br />
<br />
Her hands outstretched, seemed to pop off her bones, growing longer and pointier. The nails turning to claws. She lifted herself off the ground. She wasn’t going to let this happen to her, She had to do something. She with her new claws grabbed hold of the table and pulled herself up. She looked for something to help her, but saw nothing. She couldn’t hold her change. But then she realised. She couldn’t stop what was happening to her…but she could save mike. She grabbed a post it notes on the table and one of the pens on the floor and started writing whatever she could to help Mike. Until suddenly her legs gave way and started changing two, fragments of her leg ripping through her clothes like thorns. Her feet shrinked but like her hands the toes outstretched and formed claws. <br />
<br />
Her entire lower body was this monster now. She lay on the ground, with tears in her eyes. She had hoped she wrote enough…enough for him to understand. She could feel her neck changing, growing smaller. She cried in pain but found her voice lower in pitch and more monstrous. Then it was her head, it felt like her skull was ripping itself apart, shrinking the cage around her brain, and then absorbing her ears and nose. Until hey eyes and mouth were the only ones left.<br />
<br />
She saw her vision change to scarlet green, like some sort of night vision and her mouth grow sharper teeth. But then suddenly she felt this change in perception her mind was changing. She could see herself falling, back into spiral of nothingness, climbing against the water’s high gradient, falling into the void. She was alone again.<br />
<br />
-Erick and Mike-<br />
<br />
Erick looked at Mike…with a wild expression. Mike heard the door open violently. “M-mike…Im glad your okay mate” Erick said relieved he found a normal person. Mike turned around and saw Erick’s shocked expression, he was confused but he also looked shocked like he was looking at a ghost. Erick saw he was covered in cobwebs with a small bruise across his left cheek. “Erick?” Mike said sacred. Erick was now the one confused “Mike…I have some bad news” Erick says slowly. How was he going to break this to Mike? His girlfriend was now a psycho killer piano.<br />
<br />
But he looked intently at Erick, and Erick saw the emotions washed over his face. He wasn’t glad to see Erick he was scared by Erick. “I…think I have worst news” Mike said softly now like he was trying to soften a mistake or try to make everything okay. Erick was now worried “What…. what is it?”<br />
<br />
Mike turned back around and pointed at the floor. Erick didn’t notice it before but the was a weird smell in the room, like decaying meet or a visit to the sewer works. Erick saw the cause the of the stench and cried out in fear. He saw a pile of guts, muscle tissue and blood In the middle of the room, with pieces of glass impaled in the dead meat. Mike wasn’t convinced “Look closer Erick…at what you see”.<br />
<br />
Erick followed the orders and saw…in horror. A face, a face which Erick knew and was familiar to him. The most familiar head to him…than any others. It was his own face and his own organs splattered across the carpet of blood and glass. Erick stumbled backwards and suddenly puked all over the carpet. He was sick. Was this some sort of illusion…what was he doing there?<br />
<br />
“Erick…I don’t know what to say”. Mike said softly. But Erick wasn’t one for taking the role as the damsel he looked around with a grin on his face and cheerfully said “Well this is probably just some early April Fool’s prank…I mean you can’t really think that’s me can you”. Mike smiled slightly, but he slightly convinced and sadly even Erick was. This house, the twisting corridors, the darkness, Sei and now this. This was believable now and it grow something scary inside of Erick.<br />
<br />
“No…I don’t believe it…and you shouldn’t either” said Erick. Mike shrugged and looked closer at the corpse, he saw something inside of it and grabbed it. Erick jokingly said, “Is it wrong to say, this is a little disturbing”. But Mike didn’t stop until he pulled it out. Erick saw it as well, it was some sort of necklace, which glinted a purple light in the skylight above.<br />
<br />
In fact, the only light was from the skylight and for some strange reason Erick looked up, to see to his horror the cause of death. The skylight was fractured, the was a massive whole in the middle. Which explained the glass on the body? But how did this happen? There was no floor above this one, except for the attic but that no windows. No force on earth could of caused this. Which made Erick ever more eager to leave.<br />
<br />
“We have to get out of here” Mike was no looking up as well and nodding slowly. He agrees. They both make for the door but then Mike stops “We…have to find Sei first” Erick stopped in front of the door but even though he couldn’t see Mikes face he knew how worried he was. If that happened to Seth or Maisy he might have had the same opinion. But they weren’t here so Erick decided to tell him a lie. “I’m sorry….Mike…Sei’s gone”. He saw in front of him his friend crumble to the ground in denial “No….No”.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he grabs Erick and lifts him to the door “Your lying!!”. Erick struggles “What are you doing you knob! I wouldn’t lie about something like this”. Mike suddenly realises his mistake and drops him…” I can’t believe it”. He then accuses Erick again “YOU DID THIS…BY INVITING US TO THIS FUCKING MANSION”.<br />
<br />
Erick had enough, he walked up to Mike now angry “YOU THINK I FUCKING WANTED THIS…You really thought this was some fucking assassination attempt…Do you…I just wanted to hang out with my mates…have a good time. This isn’t my fault”. Mike looked intently at Erick and sighed heavily “How do you know she’s dead”.<br />
<br />
“I found her body…it was in the landing…come…I’ll show you…exactly what happened to Sei”.<br />
<br />
-Ryan-<br />
<br />
Ryan must have dozed off, because the next thing which happened was he was now in a new room. This room was different, the walls were marble and clean. They were bleached and filled with love and attention completely contrasting the basement. <br />
<br />
Ryan nearly forget about his injury when he made to stand up, He felt pain in his lower chest but felt it was nearly gone. Like he had been healed suddenly. He looked down and to his surprise there was a bandage around his wound and even more surprising it was recently dressed meaning…someone had found him. Ryan hoped it was Jonathan perhaps he found him in the cellar and healed him. But Jonathan didn’t know anything about wounds, so it couldn’t have been him. That would also mean it wasn’t Mike or Erick because they know nothing about how to stich a wound. <br />
<br />
But there it was, nicely stitched and with a perfectly applied dressing. Ryan then had the theory it was Sei…perhaps she found him because she was training to be a nurse she could have found him. So, Ryan looked around, trying to find her happy face…but she wasn’t there. It was just him and the room.<br />
<br />
Ryan studied the room, it was like the basement, but the shelves were organised glued to their nails with care. There was a delight of vials and glasses on the shelves and chemicals of many different colours. Ryan could see this as some sort of laboratory perhaps Jonathan was here. But that only brought up more questions. Why was he in a laboratory now. It didn’t make any sense. <br />
<br />
He walked around the room and to his surprise saw another door, maybe that led out the complex and to Jonathan. He walked through the door, which nicely slided open for him. Whatever Lab he was in…he was in high security one.<br />
<br />
He walked casually towards what he described as the centre of the complex, with multiple doors leading to different places. Ryan was shocked by how big this place was. He saw a commercial booth and decided it was best to check the computers. Ryan sat down in front of the computer and started typing. He found himself on the homepage of the website. To his surprise it was called Spell Labs. It wasn’t a coincidence that the mansion was called spellstorm then. Perhaps this place was named after it.<br />
<br />
But that wasn’t what he was looking for. He typed JONATHAN into the computer and to his surprise it came up with a few data files…which Ryan read:<br />
<br />
TN-007<br />
<br />
Subject: Jonathan Brookes<br />
<br />
Subject Time: 19/3/94<br />
<br />
Hypothesis: Hoping for genetic changes found in TN-003 and TN-004, With the key blood type and body structure this genetic modification should prove interesting on this subject. We are hoping by adding the virus to his system, his white blood cells will defend against the attack and carry on the information from the virus. We are hoping for increased muscle mass and body modification.<br />
<br />
Subject Results: DATA NOT FOUND DATA NOT FOUND DATA NOT FOUND DATA NOT FOUND<br />
<br />
ERROR/Lb47.bin<br />
<br />
The computer cut out, Ryan was horrified…what did he just witness. Was this some sick prank. No…this was real. Ryan stood up shaken from the text and looked at the location profile given at the bottom. Lb47. Was that being he would find his brother. He looked at the codex map and found a lab 47, he followed the directions and made his way towards it.<br />
<br />
-Mike- <br />
<br />
Denial. That was what mike was feeling at that time. It was like the whole world had stopped around him and was mocking him. Sei was dead…no…she was murdered. Mike had never really been alone before and he couldn’t shake this feeling it was his fault. If perhaps he had held her hand when chasing the voice or perhaps paid closer attention to her…he wouldn’t have lost her forever.<br />
<br />
-Erick-<br />
<br />
Erick wasn’t sure what to say. He saw it there in front of him. It was like the whole world had stopped around him and was mocking him. He was die…no…will die. Erick this feeling of fear, waft over him like a tidal wave of emotion, was this the future…was this his future. Maybe If he hadn’t of gone to this stupid mansion he wouldn’t of been in this situation…he was lost…he was scared.<br />
But something more pressing was falling on him…<br />
<br />
-Erick and Mike-<br />
<br />
They both had their own trauma box…and they were glued to Erick and Mike. They couldn’t escape. <br />
<br />
So, Erick was leading his way to Sei’s body. Mike was scared he didn’t know what he would do when he finds her that perhaps his whole sanity was hinging on her being alive. It was these corridors, this monster he encountered which fuelled his growing insanity. He was on a hollow beam, balancing loosely over a pit of insanity.<br />
<br />
They had made it, the room which would decide Mike’s fate. He seemed to bolt down the stairs…trying to see the truth sooner, but he saw nothing. Sei’s body wasn’t there, only him and his looming shadow blocking out the light. “Where is she?” he said growing angry now. “She’s…um” Erick says softly. “ANSWER ME WHERE IS SHE!!!!” Mike booms. Crackling noise all around them like popping candy. Erick says immediately “be quiet” quietly.<br />
<br />
But before Mike could respond, a low moaning was heard by both Erick and Mike. They both turned towards the source making no noise and saw her. Erick had encountered it before, and the same feeling of dread washed over him. If this is what could happen to Sei…his death could also happen. <br />
<br />
Mike gasped, he was shocked…It was sei. She wasn’t dead…but she was…she was…a monster. The creature walked out into the light. Erick startled backwards walking towards the front door. “Come on…Mike we have to go” Erick says quietly. But Mike was fixed to the spot, with a factory of emotions processing in his mind. “I c-can’t its…Sei..”. Erick tried to persuade him away “I’m sorry, Mike I know how much you loved her…but she is gone…that isn’t her…but a monster”. Erick was now far from both, he couldn’t stop whatever she would do and saw this as Mikes last chance.<br />
<br />
“Sei?” He said. Now walking actively towards her “Please it’s me…mike”. He was now in front of the creature “I’m your boyfriend…and I know you love me…I know you won’t hurt me.”<br />
<br />
Erick was shocked. Whatever played out next…would mean life and death for them all.<br />
<br />
-Ryan-<br />
<br />
Ryan had made it to lab 47. It was close to the centre of the complex. However, Ryan was unnerved by the sight of the door. It was unhinged…. completely torn off, with the lead bent in horrible ways. Ryan gulped scared. Whatever the computer said about the test…Ryan hoped it hadn’t already taken place. Ryan walked in…and to his surprise…saw 2 dead bodies on the ground. One a man and the other Ryan couldn’t make out. The man had two seared knifes through his chest. Which Ryan predicted was the cause of death. There was smoke which filled the room, Ryan could barely see the other body.<br />
<br />
But then he heard something from the back of the room behind the layer of smoke. A low groaning which Ryan thought was familiar. But it was definite, it was more human and less animalistic. But then he saw it clearly. It arose from the mist…7 feet tall. Sporting a muscular body and pale skin. It was…<br />
<br />
Jonathan.<br />
<br />
