<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy returned from the ranches, frustrated and unsatisfied.  Not only was the farm guarded, but the ranchers had somehow banded together into a small militia.  As soon as she entered the field, the small patrol guarding the cattle called a larger group of armed men to join them.  Their weapons still could not harm her, but the bullets annoyed her and stung a little.  She was only able to gobble down one cow before she was forced to flee.<br />
<br />
And her escape had been pitiful.  Her huge belly made stealth impossible.  It dragged on the ground, and prevented her from getting off the ground.  She just ran into the forest, knocking the trees in her way to the ground.<br />
<br />
Finally, she made her way back to the vials.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mara, enough is enough!  You come out of there right now!&quot; said Amy angrily. She strained, trying to force the egg out.  But all that she was rewarded with was a large amount of gas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mara.  You want to play.  Well, I can play, too, &quot; said Amy, as she began to rifle through the vials.<br />
<br />
She found one simply marked &quot;Growth.&quot;  Amy smiled.  This was exactly what she wanted!  If the baby was bigger, it would have to come out.  She quickly downed the entire vial, and sat back down, resting her tired limbs.<br />
<br />
Amy felt very funny. Before it was just her belly that felt odd.  But after drinking the last vial, her whole body felt strange.  She held her hand out and stared.  It looked like it was getting bigger before her eyes.<br />
<br />
What&#39;s going on? thought Amy.<br />
<br />
She stood up, and was shocked to see that she was taller.  The treetops which were previously just below eye level, were now at her chest.  And as she watched, they were getting even lower as she continued to grow.<br />
<br />
What did I do wrong? she thought desperately.  It was only supposed to work on the baby, not me!  The other vial just worked on the baby....<br />
<br />
She suddenly remembered the difference in the vials.  The multiple vial had included the word gestation.  This vial just said &quot;Growth&quot;.  Because she had ingested it, both HER and her baby were growing.<br />
<br />
Amy tried to waddle back to the box.  Her belly was swelling rapidly, brushing painfully against the ground.  The treetops looked smaller, now barely up to her ankles. The box of vials was now tiny, too small to open.  She grunted in frustration ... and also in pain.  <br />
<br />
The large egg continued to grow, pressing against her enlarging organs. She plopped on the ground, to rest her sore feet and aching belly. The egg was too big. She had to get it out. She began to push again, straining to force it out.  After several attempts and an agonizingly long time, she was rewarded as a smooth white egg popped out of her cloacae.<br />
<br />
The egg looked small. Well, small compared to her massive body.  She looked at it closely, and saw that it was still growing.  She was glad that the thing was out of her body, but she couldn&#39;t understand how something so small could have been causing her such tremendous pain.  As she continued to examine the egg, two more slipped out following the previous egg&#39;s path.  Amy stared at the new eggs in shock.<br />
<br />
What is going on? thought Amy.<br />
<br />
The new eggs looked different.  One was a blood red, while the other was a dark green with white speckles.  <br />
<br />
Are they like unfertilized eggs or something?  Like in the chickens on the farm? thought Amy.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t have long to consider it, as she felt a sudden painful cramping.  She strained and pushed again, but the pressure and pain did not go away.  Finally, she gave a massive push, and an enormous egg slowly eked out, stretching her cloacae impossibly wide.  It was followed by several smaller eggs that leaked out of the new wider opening.<br />
<br />
Amy groaned.  This hurt alot more than she had imagined.  The new egg dwarfed the size of the others, and it was still growing!  She hoped that there were not more like it.  But she didn&#39;t have much time to dwell on it, as additional eggs in her womb demanded release.<br />
<br />
Amy just grunted, and continued to lay eggs as her body slowed its growth.</p>
