<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Horizon was fairly used to animals from around the world being brought to them to be uplifted. After the initial outbreak and the successful containment of the Animalia Virus to Lyre and Animalia, more often than not this was limited to pets that were either sick, old, or had no other place to go. In some cases there were issues where Horizon&#39;s scientists asked for specimens that came from outside the US, which had been how they had gotten a few of Animalia&#39;s more notable members. Some of that also applied to the animals that were seized from a drug lord in Central America.<br />
<br />
However, a visit from a uniformed soldier holding a Korean Water Deer on a leash while a man in a black military type suit with a high collar smile was not something that Horizon was used to. Though to a certain extent it was probably something that was expected as Doctor Stein watched both come into the lab area.  Nearly every country on Earth when they learned on the physical build of Animalians had made some inquiries into uplifting animals from their countries for military use or potentially converting those already in their militaries for that purpose. To Doctor Stein, this case was merely the latest that had come to Horizon, and one they couldn&#39;t deny because of other political pressures.<br />
<br />
Though, Doctor Stein would remind his present guests that the animal they hoped to have uplifted would probably only be comparable to humans in size, perhaps a bit taller with regard to digitigrade feet, but the Water Deer when uplifted would be about the same weight as many people. There was also the fact that Animalians proved to be almost universally peaceful in ways that were quite unexpected and unexplained. Most biologists would have expected a mundane animal to still technically act like a mundane animal even after gaining a more hominid shape and at least the higher potential when it came to sentience. Yet, when Animalia was first formed with the first outbreak, the uplifted Animals worked out a moral code that was on par with anything man had come up with. And it was also found that this sort of circumstance seemed to cross not just species barriers but geography as well. Uplifted Animals from Mieni, Vilcabamba, Maelewano, and New Zerzura all seemed to think and operate on the same levels as Animalians in Lyre/Animalia, regardless of whether or not they had had prior contact with humans or Animalians. It was something that not even Doctor Stein could fully explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... Doctor... Stein?&quot; the man in the suit said slowly as they approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein nodded slowly, eyeing the soldier behind the man and holding the leash that restricted the deer&#39;s movements. For the moment the deer was a bit panicky and moving side to side at the end of the leash with its hooves clicking on the tile of the floor, but for the moment it was fairly quiet and wasn&#39;t being aggressive with anyone, &quot;and you are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may call me Hyun,&quot; the man in the suit spoke, &quot;and I am here to see to the uplifting of our Water Deer. Ling.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man gestured to the small deer. It&#39;s movements were a strange mix of timidity and tameness, as if this particular deer had been raised in a farm-like environment, which wouldn&#39;t quite fit with what Doctor Stein knew of North Korea. The country could barely feed its people, let alone feed an animal that wasn&#39;t of use as either livestock or as future food. But then, North Korea was not one of the countries where one went to look for reasonable or even respectful behavior from the government.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first of many strong soldiers and farmers for the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea,&quot; Hyun said with a smile, &quot;as per the arrangement between our respective leaders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand the agreement,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;we will uplift... Ling. Though it will be noted that Animalians, and particularly those that are uplifted animals tend to be rather peaceful. Some may engage in positions that would relate to providing security... police, for instance... but they aren&#39;t going to be the sort that will be eager to wage wars of aggression.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which Korea has NEVER done,&quot; Hyun answered, &quot;always we have been the victims of someone else&#39;s aggression! First China in the distant past, then the Japanese, and now you Americans. Regardless, we will do with our Animalian as we see fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein&#39;s eyes narrowed at that. He honestly wouldn&#39;t have allowed this, and word from nearly everyone at Horizon had voiced opposition to this, as he had the since that uplifting Ling was hardly about Ling. In fact Doctor Stein doubted that Ling had a bright future in front of her. What Hyun wanted was the Animalia Virus and direct access to it. It had represented a great leap forward in genetic science, and to a certain extent, even medicine. However, Horizon had retained patents on it in the US, primarily to make sure that their drug remained something for a positive use and couldn&#39;t be manipulated for wrong. <br />
<br />
For the highly infectious nature of the Animalia Virus represented a potential problem. Horizon had paid a lot to clean up after the initial outbreak and had been quite fortunate that the accident had only resulted in anthropomorphic animals with a high moral code. However, Doctor Stein highly doubted that political leaders in countries like North Kora, China, or Russia would use direct access to the Animalia Virus as a means to mess with it and alter it in order to get what they wanted, an army of soldiers that would have the physical power to deal with any normal soldier on the battlefield and potentially handle a larger weapon that what the standard infantryman carried. It was something that Horizon feared.<br />
<br />
But the present US government, desperate for a &quot;win,&quot; was eager to make concessions to get things it wanted. Now, while &quot;denuclearization&quot; wasn&#39;t a bad thing, Doctor Stein didn&#39;t think giving the Animalia Virus to a dictatorship with no moral scruples beyond maintaining its own power, was not a good idea. It would be too easily used either as a weapon to spread the Animalia Virus in an uncontrolled way, it could be manipulated in a way that might result in an &quot;Animalian&quot; that lacked the moral compass that Animalians seemed to instinctively have, or it might be spread to areas and governments that might come up with some unforeseen way of using the virus. To Doctor Stein, that represented too many variables and too many risks with a dictatorship that was known for its cruelty...<br />
<br />
But the present US government had made its decision. And despite the President and his supporters attacking Animalia at every opportunity over aspects of Animalia that really shouldn&#39;t have been valued as highly as they were, they had eagerly offered to uplift the Korean Water Deer, Ling, and leave Ling within the care and &quot;mercy&quot; of Kim Jong-Un. It would give North Korea unsupervised access to the Animalia Virus, or more likely pass it on to China or Russia, which would mean Horizon would lose control over its most prized asset. And Animalia as a concept would likely lose favor. Horizon had tried to argue against this, but direct threats of Horizon&#39;s license to function as a company within the US being revoked for &quot;selling drugs&quot; was ultimately enough. Technically Horizon might have been able to win the legal fights that would follow, but it would come at a heavy cost and might bankrupt the company, which it couldn&#39;t afford. Thus, Horizon agreed to it.<br />
<br />
And Hyun smugly knew it as Doctor Stein lead them to one of the smaller lab rooms where a large water bowl was set up in it. The water in it that was laced with the Animalia Virus, which was one of the ways that Horizon actually preferred to uplift most animals. It was something that was figured to be comforting. Injections might be used for Human conversion, unless it was with special cases with a partner transforming his/her love interest, or had filled out the special paperwork to allow for a sponsor that would often require some measure of coordination with Horizon. And since Ling was presently a mundane Korean Water Deer, water was the most comforting way. Doctor Stein opened the door but stayed in a position where he could interdict the soldier who was moving to almost pull the Water Deer toward the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be best that Ling be allowed to be alone as she&#39;s uplifted,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;Animalians have many of the same sentiments as humans. They can have the same desires for privacy as we do. It may not be applied in the same way all the time... but it is there.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Hyun blinked and then nodded to the soldier who maneuvered the deer so that it would run into the lab room. With a short &quot;rrrppppp&quot; the Velcro around the collar for the deer was removed and with a short bark it moved forward into the room. With that, Doctor Stein then shut the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must ask... if you do not observe, how will you know your the process works?&quot; Hyun asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we&#39;ve done this a lot, both with conversions and uplifting animals,&quot; Doctor Stein answered with suspicious eyes focused on Hyun, &quot;but while we may not observe these sorts of &quot;tests,&quot; we do retain the ability to communicate with the Animalian inside. That will enable us to see to Ling ultimately getting dressed and scheduled for acclimation classes. Helping her adapt to being an Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She will be a citizen of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea!&quot; Hyun stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as per the agreement that our leaders have reached, that is true,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;but the process of acclimation, be it Human to Animalian or mundane Animal to Animalian is required by law in the US. Which means Ling will have to spend a week or so in Lyre/Animalia where she can get better used to her new form and better used to some of the things she will likely experience in Korea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so long as there are NO tricks that would allow her to stay in your country,&quot; Hyun stated again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No tricks,&quot; Doctor Stein sighed.<br />
<br />
Hyun nodded at that. It was at that point where they heard a soft knock on the door and a slightly muted feminine voice come from within. The voice was in Korean, which Doctor Stein didn&#39;t understand, and was privately thankful that Hyun knew enough English to converse. Though, it would also mean that the only one who could translate for the deer if all she knew was Korean, was Hyun. That could make some things difficult, but Doctor Stein knew there was no way out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;She sounds confused... lost...&quot; Hyun commented as he looked to the Horizon scientist, &quot;your media portrays Animalians as intelligent!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they are,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;it&#39;s just that uplifting process can be disorientating at first, particularly as things the new Animalian may have never thought of before suddenly become present in the new Animalian&#39;s mind. They have seemed to be consciously aware of the difference. It&#39;s why things like acclimation are important for new Animalians. Even if Ling is to return to North Korea after it is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyun nodded and then smiled at the last sentence, which only further made Doctor Stein uneasy that Ling&#39;s uplifting was part of some bigger play to get unrestricted access to the Animalia Virus. Horizon could vaccinate her while she was in Animalia/Lyre, and would do so, in accordance with US Law, but given that at present the vaccine wore off after a year&#39;s time and would need to be re-administered by either Horizon or by some other medical professional. That would mean that after a year, unless the North Koreans re-administered the vaccine, Ling would be infectious again and the active and infectious form of the Animalia Virus would then be able to harvested from blood samples and providing North Korea direct access to the most powerful tool of genetic science, to use for good or for bad. And that did not make Doctor Stein feel comfortable.</p>
