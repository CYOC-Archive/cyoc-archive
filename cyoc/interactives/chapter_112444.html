<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry arrived at his office right on time and, unlike yesterday, found this new day really working in his favor. He was assertive, had no problems deciding difficult problems and whenever something would take too much work on his side, he just pushed it off to some colleague, although his old self would probably called him an asshole. But that’s what colleagues are for after all, aren’t they? Work could be so simple if he just didn’t care so much, he decided. <br />
<br />
Besides, he loved the fact that his body seemed to have entered a late puberty (or so he rationalized): His shirt was tight on the sleeves and chest to a point where he lost the topmost button to the strain somewhere during the morning, exposing the upper part of his rather generous chest hair to the world. Dark patches of hair were also showing through his white shirt in his armpits and on his belly – which showed definite signs of a six pack without Henry having even seen a gym from the inside.<br />
His jeans also felt awfully tight everywhere with muscles straining the denim on his legs and a rather large package clearly outlining in the front. With his old jeans and shirt it looked like he was wearing an extremely skinny outfit. He was not the only one noticing these changes. He caught some women and even a few men catching glimpses of him. <br />
What Henry didn’t notice at first was his smell. It took a coworker of his, coming to him at about lunch and, very politely, remarking that his deodorant might be failing for him to notice. After he sent the coworker away with a rude remark, Henry sniffed at his armpit. That idiot had no idea. Yes, he had developed a strong body odor, regardless if that came from not having showered for two days or not. But the smell was not unpleasant for henry, but strong and musky, manly even. Just smelling his own odor made him semi-hard.<br />
Having been distracted by that idiot coworker of his, Henry decided that this was the perfect time for having a dump. Although his bladder was full again, he didn’t even consider trying to use the office facilities for that purpose. That’s what Josh was there for at home!<br />
<br />
Entering the men’s restroom and heading for one of the stalls, he saw another guy standing at one of the urinals. Henry recognized him as one of the 20ish years old interns of his company, just zipping up his trousers. Henry’s cock stirred even more. He never really realized how really cute, no, fuckable, that boy was. He tried to remember his name, but failed. Whatever.<br />
“Hey, intern! Come over here!” He said, having stopped mid-room. <br />
“Do you mean me, sir?” The boy answered, looking around. As he did not see anyone else, he approached Henry. “What can I do for you, sir?” He asked politely.<br />
Henry registered the boy’s gaze wandering over his body, stopping ever so shortly in his crotch area. “Well, you seem to be enjoying the sight.” Henry grinned. “How about having a closer look while giving me a blowjob?” He added, still grinning down at the boy.<br />
“Wha-what? How did you… I mean… right *here*?”  Answered the boy <br />
“Of course right here, I don’t have all day!” Henry said, already unzipping his jeans. The smell coming from his crotch area was even more intense, he noticed, as the intern slowly approached Henrys now rock hard cock. Not wanting to wait for his slow approach however, he just grabbed the interns head and pressed him to his crotch, where, after a moment of confusion, the boy began to work Henry’s cock. <br />
It probably wasn’t his first blowjob either, because after a short while, Henry was moaning loudly. He was almost ready to cum, as the restroom door opened and another coworker entered, standing rooted to the spot as he saw them.<br />
<br />
“Hey, what – what are you doing there?” He asked, his eyes almost popping out of his head.<br />
Henry felt very self-conscious all of a sudden, standing in the middle of the restroom, letting an intern blow him. That feeling passed quickly however, as he reassured himself, that he was a man! Getting a blowjob everywhere he wanted was his right as an alpha male like he was. “What does it look like?” He grinned, pressing the boy which he didn’t even know the name of to his crotch again. <br />
“I-I. You can’t…” The other man stammered, before turning around and quickly leaving the room.<br />
 Henry was very pleased with himself, and, with another loud moan, came into the intern’s mouth. <br />
“And swallow!” Henry laughed, while zipping up and leaving the room without even looking back at his conquest. He just felt so very good about himself, it was almost unreal. <br />
<br />
Actually, he had done enough work for today, Henry considered. He was his own master and didn’t need anyone to tell him when he was supposed to be in the office and when not. Whistling, he walked out of the front door and began to head home.</p>
