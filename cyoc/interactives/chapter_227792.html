<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake took a few moments to study his wife&#39;s tentacle legs squirming about as he fell silent at the office door. Kelly was still working out how to control her flexible tentacles.<br />
<br />
Kelly looked up and smiled to Jake, &quot;Jake dear, would you do me a favor, and take off your clothes? Once your naked, try on those leggings I threw on the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake remained in his silent gaze, before slowly moving to undo his shirt. Jake pulled off is shirt, dropping it onto the floor as he stepped slowly to the bed loosening his belt. Pants, underwear, shoes, socks were soon on the floor as a naked Jake picked up the shiny printed leggings. His fully hard cocked surged as he felt the slick mucus coating the inside of the leggings. A voice in Jake&#39;s mind screamed for him to stop, but he ignored this to satisfy his lustful urge to feel his legs encased and squeezed in the shiny leggings. Jake&#39;s legs went in easily as the material stretched and the mucus lubricated his dry legs and feet all the way in. Jake stood up briefly to pull the waist up as far as he could. The moment he released the waistband, the leggings cocooned his cock and Jake throbbed as he was at the edge of orgasm, then his footing became slippery, and he lost his traction and quickly slid down onto the floor. Jake was trying to find a place on the waistband to get his fingers under, but his mind was being overwhelmed as he was held at the edge of a growing orgasm. <br />
<br />
Kelly smiled as she saw nubs grow from Jake&#39;s waist, and grow into new tentacles. Jake was unable to talk, but he was furiously massaging his mucus covered bulge trying to finish his orgasm stuck on the edge. Jake turned over face down and was humping the floor as Kelly saw the leggings sink in between his butt cheeks, vacuum forming to his body as six new tentacle legs sprouted from around his waist. Jake was in agony as he felt his whole body throb. Jake&#39;s nipples started to throb as hard as his cock as he rubbed his body into the carpet. Jake only wanted release as something entered his ass, and pushed into his cock. Jake felt the orgasmic edge grow to his whole body, before growing to tired to hump the floor and he just rested, whimpering as his body surged with a building orgasm that never arrives. Kate didn&#39;t expect this for Jake, and lowered herself out of her chair, and crawled over to Jake&#39;s side. Kate stroked his backside, and even slid a few fingers into Jake&#39;s mucus lubed, but leggings covered anus. Kelly moved her fingers down to  his balls, but they were gone. Kelly felt something, and it was the leggings that had grown into Jake. Kelly felt the leggings were forcefully thrusting into this spot between Jake&#39;s legs. Kelly laid down next to Jake, and pulled his body into hers, using her two tentacle legs to wrap around Jake&#39;s two larger tentacles. Kelly felt of Jake&#39;s large nipples, causing Jake to moan. Kelly did what she could massaging Jake&#39;s nipples, but Jake&#39;s orgasmic release never came, stuck on the edge of a greater orgasm. Kelly was regretting having Jake put on the leggings, as they were changing more than just his body from the waist down. Jake was now moaning frequently, his frustration sounding baleful. Kelly tried to help Jake get his release, massaging his nipples or massaging his crotch, only to push his body into a stronger orgasmic edge. Kelly felt guilty and stopped trying to help as Jake&#39;s tears streamed down his face as he woefully cried in between massive full body surges.<br />
<br />
Kelly whispered in to Jake&#39;s ear, &quot;I am sorry my love, I did not know this would happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake squeezed Kelly&#39;s hand several times, and Kelly hugged him tightly as they lay on the floor.<br />
<br />
Several hours later, Kelly woke up, but she had not been asleep long. Jake&#39;s cries were now different, as he was thrusting his hips forward. Jake felt something being pushed into him, and they felt huge. The first one took forever to work its way into him, but the rest seemed to go much easier and faster. Jake&#39;s mind was not working enough to even think of counting, as he was just riding the waves of pleasure that were too intense for him to handle. Hours later, Jake finally went over the edge, and massive orgasmic wave after wave thundered though his body in a waves of convulsions and seizures, his voice crying out in both agony and pleasure. Kelly was worried, not really understanding what Jake was going through, and she hoped this was the release he was desperate for. Kelly held Jake tightly for several minutes, as Jake&#39;s voice fell silent and his body continued to writhe in orgasm. Time seemed to stand still for both of them, as Jake&#39;s body eventually began to calm. Kelly left Jake to go to the bathroom, making it only to the shower as she could not stand to get onto the toilet yet. Kelly knew she was gone too long as she came back to Jake&#39;s occasionally convulsing body. Jake&#39;s eyes were open, but he was just staring into space. Kelly tried to pry the leggings off of Jake, but could not find a seam, even by his belly button. Jake&#39;s belly was that of a pregnant woman. Jake&#39;s sagging breasts drooped down as he laid on his side, his nipples partially covered with a dried milk crust. Jake&#39;s face was much softer now. Kelly felt Jake&#39;s body go limp in her embrace. Jake&#39;s eyes were closed. Kelly moved to lay down behind Jake on the floor and curled his sleeping body into her&#39;s. Kelly was so tired, that she fell asleep as soon as she closed her eyes.</p>
