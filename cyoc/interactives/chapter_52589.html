<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four years ago:<br />
<br />
Patrick was down in the Power Cave, as he liked to call it, looking over a machine. Power Play had defeated Johnny DarkNight's latest scheme to destroy them. It had been a close call though as he was in one of the tubes preparing to duplicate himself.<br />
<br />
Power Play had brought the machine here to keep it from being used. Patrick though had other thoughts. He knew that at some point in time people might figure out their secret identities and it would be great to have a double for each of them so people can see Power Play with the regular kids they pretended to be. Patrick didn't tell the others what he was thinking since they were adamant about it not being used. So it was he was in the cave by himself trying to figure the machine out. After a couple of days he believed that he had figured it out so he stripped and set the machine to duplicate him.<br />
<br />
Patrick just made it onto the platform before the tube came down. A tingling sensation ran through him as the machine started duplicating him. In the other tube his duplicate slowly faded into view. Once his duplicate was fully formed a sense of vertigo stole over him and once that passed the tubes lifted. He smiled at his duplicate and his duplicate smiled back. That is until his duplicate bent over in pain and collapsed onto the platform.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; Patrick asked as he went over to his duplicate. It was answered shortly as his duplicate started to change. His duplicate began to grow smaller and the little body hair he had receded into his skin. His hair grew longer while his body slimmed a bit looking more like a girl than a boy. That became a reality with his dick and balls shrinking until there was nothing left but a flat crotch. In the next second the area between his legs swelled slightly and split revealing a pussy while his nipples and areole grew a bit and breast buds form. Patrick couldn't believe that his duplicate had just transformed into a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot; his duplicate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You changed into a girl,&quot; he said still somewhat shocked. &quot;I don't know why or how it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we going to do?&quot; his duplicate asked. &quot;Mom and Dad are going to freak when the see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking fast Patrick said, &quot;First we get you some clothes so you're not nude. After that I'll bring you back home and we'll say that I found you wandering around without any clue who you were. If Mom and Dad see you in clothes that don't quite fit they'll believe that you've been living on the streets for a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to dirty myself up a bit to make it plausible but it's a good plan,&quot; his duplicate said.<br />
<br />
A couple hours later Patrick walked into his home with his duplicate wearing a baggy long sleeve shirt that was clearly too big for her, a pair of blue jeans with a rope for a belt and the cuffs rolled up, and a pair of dirty sneakers about a half size too big and with a few holes in them. They walked into the tea room where their mom was drinking hot tea. &quot;Hey Mom I made a new friend,&quot; Patrick said.<br />
<br />
Their mom looked up and let the cup slip from her hand and smash on the floor. Her face went white like she had seen a ghost and she quietly said, &quot;It can't be my little Kelly. They said you died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, who's Kelly?&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly's your sister Patrick,&quot; their mom said. &quot;The doctors told me that she had died soon after birth though. Her ashes are on the mantel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you look at that angel statue so sadly?&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; their mom said, &quot;but now I can see that there must have been some mistake. She looks so much like you Patrick. Where did you find her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I found her while I was walking past the old Holstein place,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;She was living in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had known you were still alive you wouldn't have had to live like that Kelly,&quot; their mom said coming over and hugging her tightly. &quot;What name have you been going by?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't had a name until Patrick decided to call me Susan,&quot; Patrick's duplicate said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You poor thing not even having a name for ten years,&quot; their mother said tears running down her cheeks. &quot;Well that's over now and you're home. We'll have to get you clothes that fit you and get you checked out. Oh I'm so happy to know that you're alive. You can't imagine my joy and your dad will be so happy too. I think a party is in order to celebrate your return to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's how Kelly came to be,&quot; Patrick said and then coughed. &quot;We never told them the truth that Kelly had died shortly after birth. We just didn't have the heart to crush their joy. Besides Dad did have a genetic test done and it proved that she's their daughter. We can't tell them the truth without exposing ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she really need those glasses?&quot; Lisa asked barely whispering and then coughing herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Kelly said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you shouldn't be telling her that stuff,&quot; Justin Macy said coming in. &quot;She'll think that you're some mad scientist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa these are my friends,&quot; Patrick said and then coughed. &quot;Close the door so I can introduce you properly.&quot; After the door was closed he continued, &quot;Now this is Justin Macy aka Force Man and the leader of Power Play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing Patrick?&quot; Justin hissed.<br />
<br />
Patrick ended up in a coughing fit so Lisa said in a whisper, &quot;It's alright I know he's X-Stream. I'm Femsha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You called me an idiot,&quot; Ryan Macy said with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you didn't move when I helped you,&quot; Lisa said in a hoarse whisper. &quot;Now I should stop talking.&quot; She then went into a coughing fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you already know Ryan is Blue Victory,&quot; Patrick said a little breathlessly. After Lisa nodded he continued, &quot;Next we have Mitchel Rineman aka Aquaboy, Marek Simpson aka Red Lightning, Nick Barkly aka Persecles, and Wesley McKnight aka Power Kid. We're Power Play except for Ryan. We've asked him to join us but so far he hasn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I like to work alone most of the time,&quot; Ryan said shrugging his shoulders. &quot;Besides how would it look for me taking orders from my little brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps we could add Lisa to Power Play,&quot; Patrick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it enough that she knows who we are?&quot; Marek asked with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust her,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;She revealed herself to me and Black Rose so we could live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know where Black Rose's loyalties lie,&quot; Justin said. &quot;She's a thief you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded and whispered, &quot;I know. I've been following her career. She's never harmed anyone though and she risked her life to rescue us. I think she may be my brother from my old life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your old life?&quot; Nick asked.<br />
<br />
Quickly and in a whispered voice Lisa explained how she got her powers and what she was before. After she had finished Kelly said, &quot;So you know how I feel going from a boy to a girl. And speaking of secret rooms I just finished the new HQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to the old one?&quot; Lisa asked wincing as she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was kind of destroyed when we brought a souvenir into the cave,&quot; Justin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kept saying that we shouldn't be taking souvenirs from our battles and that it would catch up with us,&quot; Wesley said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we need to curb that tendency,&quot; Justin said. &quot;It was a good thing no one was in there at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa and Patrick both went into a coughing fit and Kelly said, &quot;I think we should leave and let them rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea,&quot; Justin said.<br />
<br />
Once they had gone Lisa closed her eyes and wondered if she could really be part of Power Play.</p>
