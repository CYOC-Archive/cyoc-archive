<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had been in the center for four days now, they would be transforming for another three days and then a week to get used to their new bodies. For Mary Maxwell she hated what she was becoming, she knew she had it better then most but she still didn’t like it. She stood in the shower letting the hot water run over her body, finally she stepped out and started to dry off, a towel was getting less and less effective with each passing day but a hair dryer worked wonders. She went to work on drying off, before wiping away the steam from the bathroom mirror. <br />
“One more step closer to fox hood.” Said Kim as she looked at herself, if she didn’t know better she would have assumed that she was wearing an reddish orange one piece swim suit with a white central port. In truth she was covered from shoulders to groin with reddish orange fox fur with white fur starting at the base of her neck, spreading out over her breasts before traveling down her stomach and now going down to about her café muscles. From there down her legs where still human and same with her arms from the shoulder down. A large bushy tail with a white tip now moved freely behind her and two black furred fox ears stuck through her blonde hair. “I wonder if I will remain a blonde or will that fall out? I have seen both.”<br />
She shock her head and put away the towel she used to whip off the human flesh part, before putting on some shoes. She didn’t mess with cloths, they would be so itchy to drive her crazy, her mother had called her out on that until her or rather his fur came in. Instead she grabbed a belt which contained multiple pouches containing everything from wallet to her cell phone. She clipped it on and walked out toward the kitchen area.<br />
She found her mother…or would it be her father now working on a breakfast which wasn’t from the center’s cafeteria. Her mother or father she wasn’t sure, her mother’s breasts where gone but the fur was so thick around the groan area she couldn’t see if she was now a he, her fur was equally as thick down there so was no way to tell. <br />
“Morning mother.” Said Mary<br />
“Morning.” Answered Susan as she paused for a moment, she wasn’t a woman anymore that had changed last night…a major thing to talk about in therapy. She had expected to be a werewolf but she wasn’t not really, her ears had come in large and round, her tail was short and when her muzzle came in which was a shock to say the least it wasn’t as long as a normal wolf. It took the doctors a while to figure it out, then her fur came in a patch work of browns, black and white. She was becoming an African Wild Dog furry of all things. She licked her lips with her long tongue as she fried some bacon, her entire body apart from the arms where covered with fur but her legs still hadn’t changed to be a dog like joint. She still had her long human hair however it had changed to match the color of her fur. The only good thing is she think she dropped almost 15 years in age, from almost 45 to just over 30. <br />
“I made bacon for your father, me and you and the rest have fresh berries.” announced Susan, wondering how she should tell her family she was now a he and what name to call her/himself now.<br />
“Morning.” Said Jennifer as she came out of the room rubbing her larger eyes, one of her large bunny ears fell down. Unlike either Susan or Mary, Jennifer had lost all her human hair only to be replaced with fur, in fact her changes looked totally done, her white with brown patches of fur covered her entire body, her face had pushed out into a short bunny like muzzle with a changed mouth, whiskers grew out of the sides of her face. Her feet where longer and she even moved her nose side to side without thinking like a real bunny. Jennifer sat down and pulled some berries and greens and began to eat, no more meats for her. <br />
For a while nothing happened and then the door to their parents room opened and out came the now much shorter version of their father, he was also clearly now a woman with small but well-proportioned for his now shorter body breasts. Everyone had assumed he would be a tiger, lion or a leopard but in the end, he became a Lynx, with brownish fur short tuff ears and the like. Like his youngest daughter he looked fully like a lynx woman.  With short claws for fingernails with padded hands and feet. Like his wife he had dropped almost 15 years of age in four days.<br />
“Well…” said Mike as he took a seat. “I think I am done.”<br />
“So…you are a woman now?” inquired Mary as she looked at her father. <br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Mike <br />
“I am a man now.” Answered Susan<br />
“Well aren’t we all strange.” Said a new voice as they turned to see John walking out of his room, he still wore a shirt and shorts because none of that had changed yet. His feet where now hooves and while his hands still had fingers the tips where hardened like hooves. His fur was brown, and his face had pushed out into a small muzzle with black nose. He still had his short brown hair but now he had a six-point antlers coming out of the top of his head. <br />
“Morning buck.” Laughed Mary to her twin brother who sat down, eyeing the bacon but turning to eat the berries and greens. He couldn’t eat the meat anymore now that he was becoming a male deer, a buck. <br />
The last two to come out, like always where the twins Noah and Lucas, however you could now tell the identical twins apart. Noah had thick black ram horns coming out of the side of his head with goat like ears, he had a very hairy chest but from the waist down his whole body was covered with thick black fur. As a Fawn Noah would be end up the most human of his entire family. Lucas was becoming a raccoon furry apart from his tail, he looked finished as well. With thick dark grey fur and black fur in the classic raccoon pattern over the face. <br />
“Another wonderful day with a family becoming half animal monsters.” Said John.</p>
