<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the shoot wrapped, Matt felt a sense of exhilaration and power coursing through his veins. The twins, Kaspar and Kristaps, still looked up at him with awe, their bodies sticky from the scene but their eyes filled with lust. It was clear they were far from done with him—and the feeling was mutual.<br />
<br />
The director and crew began packing up, signaling the end of the day’s work, but Matt had other ideas. He glanced at the twins, a sly grin spreading across his face as he wiped himself down with a towel. “What do you say we head back to my place?” he asked, his voice low and suggestive.<br />
<br />
Kaspar and Kristaps exchanged excited glances, their cheeks flushed. “Yeah, we’d love that,” Kristaps said eagerly.<br />
<br />
“Definitely,” Kaspar added, his hand already resting on Matt’s thick forearm, admiring the bulging muscle beneath his fingertips.<br />
<br />
With that, they slipped back into their clothes and followed Matt out of the studio. The short walk through the streets of Riga was electric with anticipation, the cool evening air doing little to calm the heat between them. Matt led the way with a cocky swagger, confident in his role as Markuss, the dominant top that everyone wanted. The twins trailed behind him, unable to keep their eyes off his powerful body, still awestruck by the presence of the man who had just dominated them so effortlessly.<br />
<br />
They arrived at Matt’s sleek apartment, and as soon as the door shut behind them, the sexual tension in the air thickened. The twins looked around briefly before their attention returned to Matt. His broad back and muscled arms were practically begging to be touched.<br />
<br />
Matt turned to face them, a predatory smirk on his lips. “Take off your clothes,” he commanded, his voice deep and authoritative.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, the twins stripped down, their slender bodies fully exposed once more. Matt watched with satisfaction, knowing exactly what they wanted. He flexed his pecs, his muscles rippling under the soft lighting of his apartment. “Now get on your knees,” he ordered, his cock already hardening at the sight of their eager faces.<br />
<br />
Kaspar and Kristaps dropped to their knees in front of him, their eyes wide with desire. Matt took a step forward, letting his massive cock hang just in front of their faces. “You know what to do,” he said, his voice a growl of dominance.<br />
<br />
Kaspar moved first, licking a slow, teasing line up the length of Matt’s shaft, while Kristaps kissed his way up Matt’s muscular thighs. The feeling of their soft lips and tongues sent waves of pleasure through him, but Matt wasn’t satisfied with just that. He wanted more—he wanted control.<br />
<br />
“Take turns,” Matt growled, placing a firm hand on the back of Kaspar’s head, guiding him to take Matt’s cock fully into his mouth. Kaspar obeyed, his lips stretching around the thick shaft as he sucked eagerly, his eyes fluttering closed in pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Now you,” Matt said, pulling Kaspar back and pushing Kristaps forward. Kristaps wasted no time, taking Matt deep into his mouth, his hands gripping Matt’s muscular thighs for support.<br />
<br />
Matt’s dominance took over completely. He grabbed both twins by the hair, guiding them as they alternated between sucking and licking his cock. The feeling of complete control sent a thrill through him. Their soft moans only spurred him on, but Matt had an even dirtier idea in mind.<br />
<br />
“Stand up,” Matt commanded, stepping back and gesturing for the twins to rise. They complied, their slim bodies trembling with anticipation. Matt grinned, his eyes dark with lust.<br />
<br />
“Now,” he said slowly, his voice dripping with authority, “I want you two to touch each other.”<br />
<br />
Kaspar and Kristaps exchanged uncertain glances, their eyes wide with surprise. Matt chuckled, stepping closer to them, his massive body looming over their smaller frames. “Come on, don’t be shy,” he coaxed, his tone teasing but firm. “You know you want to.”<br />
<br />
Kaspar was the first to move, his hand reaching out to gently stroke his brother’s chest. Kristaps shivered at the touch, his own hand sliding down Kaspar’s side. Matt watched, his cock throbbing at the sight of the two identical twins exploring each other’s bodies, their touches hesitant at first but growing bolder with each passing moment.<br />
<br />
“That’s it,” Matt encouraged, his voice a low purr. “You two look so fucking good together.”<br />
<br />
The twins kissed then, soft at first, but as Matt’s deep voice continued to egg them on, the kiss became more passionate, more intense. Kaspar’s hands slid down to Kristaps’s ass, squeezing the firm cheeks as their tongues tangled together. Kristaps moaned into the kiss, his cock hard against his brother’s stomach.<br />
<br />
Matt watched with satisfaction, stroking his own cock as he reveled in the scene. The sight of the two beautiful, identical men giving in to their desires, doing exactly what he wanted, was beyond arousing. He stepped closer, his thick cock brushing against Kaspar’s ass as he reached down to guide them onto the bed.<br />
<br />
“Now let me show you how it’s done,” Matt growled, his voice full of dominance. He positioned Kaspar on all fours, pulling Kristaps down next to him so he could watch. The twins were panting now, fully immersed in their lust and submission to Matt’s control.<br />
<br />
Matt didn’t hesitate. He grabbed Kaspar by the hips, his thick cock pressing against Kaspar’s tight hole. Kaspar let out a gasp, his fingers gripping the sheets as Matt thrust into him with a slow, deliberate force. The muscles in Matt’s arms and back flexed as he began to fuck Kaspar, his powerful body taking complete control of the situation.<br />
<br />
Kristaps watched, his hand stroking his own cock as he moaned at the sight of his brother being dominated by the muscular porn star. Matt smirked, reaching over to grab Kristaps by the hair, pulling him in for a rough kiss. Kristaps moaned into Matt’s mouth as Matt continued to pound into Kaspar, his cock driving deeper with every thrust.<br />
<br />
“Don’t stop touching each other,” Matt ordered, his voice rough and breathless. Kristaps obeyed, his hand reaching down to stroke his brother’s cock as Matt fucked him. The twins moaned in unison, their bodies writhing together under Matt’s control.<br />
<br />
Matt’s pace quickened, his powerful hips slamming into Kaspar’s ass with a relentless rhythm. The room filled with the sounds of their moans, the slap of skin against skin, and Matt’s deep, dominant growls as he took full control of both twins.<br />
<br />
“Good boys,” Matt groaned, his voice filled with satisfaction. “Keep going. Show me how much you want this.”<br />
<br />
The twins responded eagerly, their hands and mouths exploring each other’s bodies as they moaned and writhed beneath Matt. It wasn’t long before Matt felt the familiar surge of pleasure building inside him. With one final, powerful thrust, he groaned loudly, spilling his cum deep inside Kaspar.<br />
<br />
He pulled out, panting, and stood back, watching with a smug grin as the twins collapsed onto the bed, breathless and spent. But Matt wasn’t done yet.<br />
<br />
“Now, clean each other up,” he ordered, his voice still dripping with authority. The twins obeyed without hesitation, turning toward each other and kissing once again, their hands roaming over each other’s bodies as they licked and kissed away the remnants of their intense encounter.<br />
<br />
Matt stood over them, satisfied and dominant. He knew that, in this body, he could have anything he wanted—and these twins were just the beginning.<br />
After the intense session with the twins, Matt wiped the sweat from his brow, feeling both physically spent and fully invigorated by his dominance. He glanced at the twins, still sprawled out on his bed, tangled up in each other, and decided it was time to cool off. With a satisfied smirk, he walked toward the bathroom, his powerful muscles gleaming under the apartment’s soft lighting.<br />
<br />
The shower was large and luxurious, with sleek tiles and a glass enclosure that offered a view of the city skyline. Matt turned the water on, letting the steam rise as he stepped inside. The hot water cascaded over his broad shoulders and muscular back, washing away the sweat and grime from the scene before. He ran his hands over his chest, feeling the thick muscles flex beneath his touch, and let out a low, contented sigh.<br />
<br />
This life—this body—was more than he could have ever dreamed of. The sheer power he felt, the way people responded to him, it was intoxicating. And the best part? He had full control, and he was just getting started.<br />
<br />
As Matt rinsed off, his mind drifted back to the twins. He could still picture the way they had looked up at him with awe and desire, the way they had submitted so easily to his dominance. It had felt incredible to command them, to push them to explore their boundaries with each other.<br />
<br />
But there was a hunger still burning inside him—a desire for more. He wondered how far he could push them, how much more he could take from them.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the shower, water dripping down his sculpted frame, Matt grabbed a towel and wrapped it around his waist. He returned to the bedroom, expecting to find the twins still catching their breath.<br />
<br />
Instead, he found something even more enticing.<br />
<br />
Kaspar and Kristaps were now fully engrossed in each other, their lithe bodies intertwined in the middle of his bed. The sheets were tangled around their legs as they moved together, their moans filling the room. Kaspar was on his back, his hands gripping his brother’s waist as Kristaps rode him, his slim frame arching and grinding with pure lust.<br />
<br />
Matt’s eyes darkened with desire as he stood in the doorway, watching the twins have full-blown sex on his bed. Their identical faces twisted with pleasure, their movements synchronized, as if they had been doing this for years. The sight was enough to make Matt’s cock harden again beneath the towel.<br />
<br />
For a moment, he simply stood there, taking in the scene. The twins hadn’t noticed him yet, too lost in their own world of pleasure. Kristaps threw his head back, his hands on Kaspar’s chest as he rode his brother harder, their moans growing louder with each thrust.<br />
<br />
Matt’s smirk returned. Could he handle both of them? Absolutely.<br />
<br />
“Looks like you two started the fun without me,” Matt said, his deep voice cutting through the sounds of their moans.<br />
<br />
Both twins froze for a moment, their eyes snapping open as they realized they were being watched. Kristaps, still straddling his brother, turned to look at Matt, his face flushed with a mixture of embarrassment and arousal. Kaspar, beneath him, looked equally surprised, but neither of them stopped.<br />
<br />
Matt dropped the towel, his cock already rock-hard again, and strode toward the bed with the confidence of a man who knew exactly how to take control. “You boys didn’t think I’d let you finish without me, did you?” he teased, his voice full of dominance.<br />
<br />
Kristaps bit his lip, his eyes flicking down to Matt’s thick cock. “We… we didn’t think you’d mind,” he panted, still grinding slowly against his brother.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t mind,” Matt growled, climbing onto the bed, his massive body dwarfing theirs. “In fact, I’m going to help you both finish.”<br />
<br />
With a rough but controlled motion, Matt grabbed Kristaps by the hips, pulling him off his brother and positioning him on all fours beside Kaspar. The twin gasped, but he didn’t resist, his body trembling with excitement as Matt spread his legs wider.<br />
<br />
“Hold still,” Matt commanded, his voice dripping with authority. He positioned himself behind Kristaps, his cock pressing against the tight, inviting entrance. Matt glanced over at Kaspar, who was watching with wide eyes, his cock still hard and throbbing. “And you—keep your brother hard.”<br />
<br />
Kaspar didn’t need any more encouragement. He reached out, stroking his brother’s cock as Matt slowly pushed into Kristaps, his thick shaft filling him inch by inch. Kristaps let out a choked moan, his body shuddering as Matt stretched him open.<br />
<br />
Matt groaned, feeling the tightness of Kristaps’s body wrapped around his cock. “Fuck, you’re tight,” he muttered, gripping the twin’s hips as he started to thrust. His movements were slow at first, deliberate, savoring every inch of the twin beneath him.<br />
<br />
Kristaps moaned louder, pushing back against Matt’s powerful thrusts as his brother stroked him in time with their movements. The bed creaked beneath them as Matt picked up the pace, his muscles rippling with each thrust. He was in total control, dominating both twins at once, and it felt fucking incredible.<br />
<br />
“Kaspar,” Matt growled, his voice rough with lust, “get over here.”<br />
<br />
Kaspar scrambled up onto his knees, his eyes wide with anticipation. Matt smirked, pulling out of Kristaps for a moment to give Kaspar room. “Switch places with your brother,” Matt ordered, his tone firm.<br />
<br />
Kristaps slid out from under Matt, panting and flushed, and Kaspar quickly took his place. Matt wasted no time in thrusting deep into Kaspar, his cock filling him completely. Kaspar cried out, gripping the sheets as Matt’s powerful body took control of him. Kristaps, still trembling from the intensity of being fucked, knelt beside his brother and continued to stroke his cock.<br />
<br />
Matt’s dominance only grew with every thrust. He alternated between the twins, fucking Kaspar hard and deep before pulling out and taking Kristaps again, his body moving with raw, animalistic desire. The twins moaned and writhed beneath him, their bodies completely at his mercy.<br />
<br />
“You two like this, don’t you?” Matt growled, his voice dark and commanding. “Being fucked like this—both of you at the same time?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir,” they moaned in unison, their voices breathless and filled with lust.<br />
<br />
Matt grinned, driving his cock deeper into Kristaps before pulling out and thrusting back into Kaspar. The power surged through him as he dominated both twins, their identical moans filling the room. He was in complete control—over their pleasure, over their bodies—and it was the most exhilarating feeling in the world.<br />
<br />
The pace quickened, the sound of their bodies slamming together filling the room. Matt’s cock throbbed with every movement, his powerful muscles flexing as he fucked them relentlessly, switching between them with expert precision.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to fill both of you,” Matt growled, his voice rough with pleasure. “And you’re going to love it.”<br />
<br />
Kaspar moaned, his body trembling as Matt fucked him harder, his cock driving deep inside. Kristaps leaned in, kissing his brother as Matt’s thrusts sent them both closer to the edge. Matt grunted, feeling the pressure building inside him.<br />
<br />
With one final, powerful thrust, Matt came, his cock pulsing as he filled Kaspar with hot, thick cum. He pulled out and immediately thrust into Kristaps, groaning as he pumped the last of his load into the other twin.<br />
<br />
Both twins collapsed onto the bed, panting and spent, their bodies still trembling from the intensity of the experience. Matt stood over them, his chest heaving, a satisfied smirk on his face. He had handled them both, and he had done it perfectly.<br />
<br />
As they lay there, completely spent, Matt couldn’t help but feel a rush of satisfaction. He had completely dominated these two beautiful twins, and the best part was, he knew there would be plenty more to come.</p>
