<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at the hospital, we were greeted by Miss. Patterson, my friend's mom. Saying nothing to us, she said to mother, &quot;Thomas is in surgery and they expect him to pull through; though they do say that there will be a chance that he might be paralyzed from the waist down. They got the son-bitch who did this. Turns out he'd been driving drunk on a suspended license.&quot; At which she began to cry.<br />
<br />
Mother led all of us to a small waiting room and looking at Katherine, said, &quot;You may go play, princess.&quot; Looking at me, she said, &quot;Take a seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
We wound up staying until about nine o'clock when finally the doctors let us see Thomas, but only after Ms. Patterson. The only real odd thing I can point out about this experience, was when I told mom that I had to use the bathroom. Taking my hand, she asked if Linda, Ms. Patterson, could watch Katherine. After which she took me to the bathroom, in the girl's restroom. Looking at me, a strange look on her face, she told me, &quot;Ashley, girls’ pee sitting down. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Really embarrassed that I'd have to go in the girl's restroom and because of how I was dressed, I nodded and entered the lavatory. It was just like the men's room, only there were no urinals and there was a metal box in the stall that read 'Tampons and Pads'. Ignoring the box, I hiked the dress up, dropped my drawers and sat down on the toilet.<br />
<br />
It was about then that I could feel my mind slip and for once I was glad. Letting the odd feeling creep over me, I began to hum a song from one of the Disney Princesses DvD that Katherine had. Finished, I exited the stall, washed my hands and left the bathroom.<br />
<br />
When we got home, mother finally let me take off the girl's clothes, but something in my mind didn't want to and when I finally pushed it back, the strangeness of this whole evening came crashing down. In my room, I stripped and looked into the mirror. I hadn't transformed any more, but looking around my room, I saw minour changes here and there.<br />
<br />
My desk had disappeared and I now had a vanity. Seeing this, I felt my mind begin to slip as I thought, &quot;Lets play dress-up with mommy's make-up.&quot; Shaking my head, clearing it, I saw that my sheets were Hello Kitty and I had a matching comforter. On top of that was the Doll I'd taken from Katherine's room and next to that was an Angelina Ballerina plush.<br />
<br />
Tired, not wanting to fight anything any more, I pulled on a pair of pajamas, was silently thankful that they were still for a male, and climbed into bed.<br />
<br />
Sunday passed with no incident, though mother was still mad at me. On Monday I was glad that this strange transformation hadn't still switched my schools and entered Thomas Jefferson Junior High. No slip-ups during the day, but I was in for a nasty surprise when I arrived home.<br />
<br />
After school, I walked in the front door and was right away greeted by my mother, who handed me two things. Looking at the first, I saw that it was a pinkish white ballerina outfit. The other was a pair of black leggings and a Lycra body suit. Looking at mother for answers, she grins at me and tells me, &quot;The rest of your punishment is this. On Tuesdays and Thursdays you and Katherine have Ballet classes together. On Wednesday and Friday, you both have Gymnastics class. To make sure you attend and don't try and skip out, I will be driving you to and from the classes. Oh, and I will be watching you in class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how to get out of this, I sputtered out, &quot;This is so unfair! You punish me for dressing in that bathing suit by having me take classes for a girl. This is so unfair!&quot;<br />
<br />
My mother looked at me and replied, &quot;Both of these classes can be taken by boys and girls. This is your punishment, I made up my mind, now go to your room until dinner!&quot; Frustrated, I marched to my room and slammed it for good measure to let her know how upset I was.<br />
<br />
Hugging Angelina, I lay on my bed. Sitting up, I looked around and breathed a sigh of relief when it became apparent that nothing else had changed. Jumping off my bed, I opened the closet and saw the sundress hanging there. Several more of the cubbyholes had labels and folded up in one of them was the bathing suit. Seeing the one marked 'Ballet and Gymnastics class', I placed the uniforms in them and closed the door and went to get my backpack to start my homework.<br />
<br />
Tuesday at school passed without incident and after school mother picked me up and drove me to my ballet class. There, she directed me to the girls changing room and when I tried to ask about this, she simply told me, &quot;Hush.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I pulled off my clothes, mother handed me a thong and told me to put it on. Looking at the fabric, my mind slipping, I shook my head and asked her, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
She them explained that I couldn't wear my underwear, which would show through the fabric. Not liking this, feeling my mind slipping, I pulled on the underwear. Tucking back my penis and testicles so that they couldn't be seen, I finally gave in when I saw Katherine also dressed in the same kind of panties. Giggling, as if sharing some private joke, we pulled on our tights and then the body suit piece and went out for class.<br />
<br />
After class, still lost in acting like a little girl, we went to see Thomas and his mom at the hospital. After that, mom drove us home and fixed us dinner. It was after dinner and I was heading to my room that I came back to myself. Or more appropriately when I saw what my room had transformed into.<br />
<br />
Opening my door, I saw that my room had become a storage room for the odds and ends stuff we had collected over the years. Seeing the plastic Christmas tree laying were my bed should be, I called out, &quot;Mom, did you move my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing Katherine's door open, I saw my bed along the far wall, still with Hello Kitty sheets and comforter. On top of it was the doll and stuffed mouse. While I was looking at this, mother had come up the stairs and looking into my sister's room, told me, &quot;No, it's still there,&quot; and began walking back downstairs.<br />
<br />
Upset about this turn of events, not wanting to share a room with Katherine, after all I am a boy and she is a girl, I entered and felt my mind start to slip.<br />
<br />
On Katherine's side of the room it was Disney and Princess, while on my side of the room it was Hello Kitty and Angelina Ballerina. I saw my vanity and the full body mirror that had been in my room at one time. Shaking my head, I open the closet and saw that it had been divided in two. On one side was all of Katherine's dresses and her toy chest for her dolls. On the other side was the cubbyholes, now with more labels and next to it, I saw that more dresses had been added to the sundress I'd worn the other evening. Placing the ballet outfit in it's proper place, I turned and left the walk-in closet.<br />
<br />
Sitting down at the vanity, I start to open the four drawers. In the top one on the left I found underwear; mixed with my male ones were various Angelina Ballerina and Hello Kitty panties. Also mixed in were several thongs that I knew were for my gymnastics and ballet classes; don't ask me how I knew, I just did.<br />
<br />
Below that drawer I found all of my socks, but mixed in with these were several different tights and I could feel my mind slipping as I suddenly felt the silky fabric and wanted so badly to wear a pair of them.<br />
<br />
Shaking my head, I closed the drawer and ignoring the other drawers, I went and lay down on my bed. Without thinking about, I inserted my thumb in my mouth and hugged Angelina closer to me, staring at the wall. As my sister entered and began playing with her toys, I didn't say anything, but thought to myself, &quot;What the fuck is going on here? Is it the medallion or the dress that is doing this to me? Am I going to wake-up one day and find that I'm suddenly a three year old girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Knowing that I was still male, knowing my penis and testicles were still present, I pondered over the situation. When my sister came up to me and asked, &quot;Do you want to play Dress-up?&quot; I wondered how to best answer her, my mind taking another slip.</p>
