<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was sweaty back breaking work for both Nate and Alex. Laying sod was their least favorite task, but it was a lucrative task that both will walk away with a lot of money when the job is done. Each removing their shirts within the first hour of work; their chiseled chests and beefy arms glistening and gleaming from the dirt and sweat all over them. Both Alex and Nate had a small crowd of females watching them and enjoying the show. While Alex was flattered with the obvious wolf whistles coming his way; it was hearing Nate’s laughter as he stopped to take a drink of water that made him roll his eyes.<br />
“You can’t deny that the ladies like what they see Alex,” Nate laughing; “despite this being a dirty job, there are some definite benefits.”<br />
“While I am flattered with the attention,” Alex lightly chuckling; “you know Ben is the one I want.”<br />
“That is all too clear,” Nate smiling as he takes a photo of Alex and composes a message for Ben.”<br />
“What are you doing,” Alex asking as he tries to grab Nate’s phone. <br />
“Helping Ben,” Nate laughing; “get in the mood when he sees his lover all dirty and sweaty, flush with cash.”<br />
“Ben and I don’t need help,” Alex smiling; “in that regard. But speaking of cash?”<br />
“Both you and I are going to walk away from this job,” Nate putting his phone away while washing his hands; “with a close to a grand each. I’ll let you think on that,” Nate grinning; “as you eat your sub sandwich, lets break for lunch.”<br />
<br />
Alex nearly chokes on his water as Nate told him what each was walking away with. Following Nate back to the pick-up truck as they break for lunch; Alex looks dumbfounded as he sees Nate eating his foot long hoagie.<br />
“Did you get cheques for some to the work we did,” Alex asking.<br />
“No,” Nate sighing; “that is a headache I’m still dealing with. This job,” Nate smiling; “the client paid in advance. With the price of sod depending on the grass requested ranges from fifty cents to four dollars a square foot. The grass we are laying down,” Nate pausing to take a drink of water; “is Kentucky Blue Grass. Our client is the were-horse rep of the council; she and her husband like to watch the horse races and i guess fell in love with the feel of the grass on their hooves and fur. We may only be laying three hundred square feet of the stuff,” Nate finishing his hoagie; “but after the cost of material and labor; we are walking away with a lot of cash. Well you are,” Nate looking at Alex; “my cut has to go towards the bills and overhead.”<br />
“What overhead,” Alex asking; “your office half the time is sitting on the toilet and the other time on your bed being tormented by Jean.”<br />
“I don’t talk to clients when on the toilet,” Nate whining; “what makes you think that?”<br />
<br />
Well,” Alex smiling as he joins Nate in getting back to work; “we’ve been eating a lot of wild game of late. Even Ben is grumbling with having brief bouts of constipation.”<br />
“That’s him stressing out,” Nate answering; “over finding a part time job. He could have saved himself the grief and work for me. And feasting on a single twelve point buck last month,” Nate responding; “doesn’t count as eating a lot of wild game. Unless of course you and Ben,” Nate smiling; “have been hunting more than just your usual rabbit snack before bed.”<br />
“Well I can’t deny,” Alex answering; “that wasn’t fun, Ben and I joining you and Jean, along with Eric Spencer and Frieda. But what the hell was that aroma after we ate that buck to the bone? It was driving me and Ben wild with lust.”<br />
“Ah,” Nate smiling wistfully; “Jean and I got hit with that to and just went at each other like mad. You know that bond my brother has with Spencer and Frieda?”<br />
“What of it,” Alex asking.<br />
“When those three rut together,” Nate looking bemused as he shakes his head; “there combined scents mingling and mixing in the air act as an aphrodisiac. It makes any were nearby desire their mate in more ways than one. Hearing you two howl madly as Jean and I announced our climaxes as loud as possible…”<br />
“The forest grew still in both fear and awe,” Alex grinning; “we got to do that again.”<br />
“Then,” Nate grinning; “we werewolves should bag the buck first. Eric catching and getting the kill,” Nate shakes his head; “you’re lucky you are an only child Alex. Dealing with my younger were-panther brother strutting around like a proud peacock all pleased with himself, purring loudly as his girlfriend’s look on like he was the perfect specimen of man. Even Jean,” Nate sighing; “was looking at my brother in lustful way.”<br />
“Oh ho,” Alex laughing while grabbing another roll of sod any laying it down; “you’re jealous of your brother. He’s getting more pie from two weres than you could ever imagine.”<br />
“Just shut up and get back to work,” Nate sighing; regretting the conversation as he stares at the yard; ‘Halfway done,’ Nate sighing to himself. Taking a brief moment to take a selfie of his current sweaty and dirty self; he sends it to Jean with a saucy message.<br />
‘I can’t wait to feel your rough lioness tongue cleaning me up.’<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ben was at Grrrrrrr. Spending the morning to get ready for his noon interview; Ben was feeling nervous. Spending his entire summer break looking for a part time job; he was almost at the point where he was about to break down and work for Nate. Getting a call for this job opening; gave the werewolf the courage he needed to keep going. Seeing the picture of his half naked boyfriend all sweaty and dirty from hard work that Nate texted him; Ben couldn’t help but growl, aroused at seeing his lover’s fit body. Alex’s six pack abs clearly visible, his biceps the size of pythons. He wasn’t ripped like body builders; but Alex was toned and clearly stacked. Ben knew he was going to be exploring that body of Alex’s later on. Nate lit a fire in him; Ben was eager to have Alex stoke and quench it within him.<br />
<br />
Putting away his cell phone as Ben arrived at the restaurant; explaining to the attendant that he was here regarding the busboy position. Waiting a few minutes; he was soon escorted to the back in the kitchen, just as lunch service was about to begin. Meeting the owner of the establishment; a were-fox with fur indicating his fursona was based of the artic fox. With reddish orange eyes in stark contrast to the white fur; the man waves a paw encouraging Ben to sit down.<br />
<br />
It was a tense twenty minutes later that Ben was being given a tour of the kitchen. Now in his werewolf fursona; he was surprised to see the kitchen staff also in their fursona. Seeing two were-skunk line cooks working along with the chef who was a were-badger. Several were-otter waiters coming in to collect the food as it was prepared for the guests coming in to dine. Grrrrrrr had a set meal instead of a menu. Every day was something different being served. For this particular day; Ben could smell a trio of sliders. Beef with blue cheese and caramelized onions for on slider; lamb and rendered bacon fat with avocado and pickles. But it was the last slider that got Ben’s nose twitching; smelling the rich tangy bbq sauce along with sundried tomatoes, Ben couldn’t place the protein. The owner grinning and stating it was a blend of wild boar and bison. Sampling the slider, made Ben’s mouth water as he growled; enjoying the taste of the food.<br />
<br />
“If you think that is something,” the chef speaking up; “know that it’s the deserts that make this place a huge hit.”<br />
“Just ask many of the feline based weres,” one of the were-skunks speaking up; “the rice pudding doesn’t last long. Even when its topped with our fresh made ice cream.”<br />
“Cat nip tends to drive them wild,” Ben chuckling; “my mom’s came here during Christmas and told me of their mad desire to lick the bowl clean. They are both were-cats by the way.”<br />
“And how do you know there is cat nip in the dessert,” the owner speaking.<br />
“My friend’s brother’s girlfriend’s mother,” Ben speaking; “figured it out the first time she dined here. She is a doctor and a were-panther/feline hybrid.”<br />
“Hybrids are difficult to figure out,” the owner nodding; “we had a werewolf/panther/feline hybrid here a while back. She was a challenge.”<br />
“She’s the daughter of the mother I just mentioned,” Ben answering; “her friends are both were-panthers and her lovers to boot.”<br />
“Small world,” the were-badger cook answering; “so do we have our new bus boy?”<br />
“Let’s see how he handles the lunch service,” the were-fox owner grinning tossing Ben Twist an apron.</p>
