<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was not Jeff&#39;s alarm that woke Jenny, but a slight itch around her hips and the sounds from outside as the world itself woke up. Sounds that, while still sounding oddly muffled, almost made her believe she was already outside.<br />
When she opened her eyes though, she was right where she fell alseep: in front of the couch in master Jeff&#39;s bedroom, and almost immediately her hands shot towards her ears, or rather, where her human ears were supposed to be, instead her ears were slightly higher up on her head, forming her brand new and slightly floppy dog ears.<br />
Her master was still fast asleep, and as she looked at his clock (she noted she could still read the time, but it took slightly more effort then it used to), saw he would remain asleep for almost an hour longer before the alarm went off.<br />
<br />
After deciding to make her way to the bathroom to take a better look at her changes, Jenny stood up and immediately noticed a second change: her feet and legs were already changing, with her feet elongating and showing the beginning of her new paw pads, and her upper and lower legs slightly shortened, forcing her to adopt a slight digitgrade stance, one she was sure would grow more pronounced as the day passed by, she also noted the changes made her slightly shorter, and after trying it out, noted the changes also made her a lot more comfortable when standing on hands and feet, as she made her way to the bathroom she tried walking on all fours, which, though easier, still felt awkward<br />
<br />
Jenny opened the door to the bathroom and immediately stripped, as she looked into the mirror she noted that the fur on her tail had started to spread all over her buttocks and worked its way around her hips to join up with her rapidly regrowing patch of public hair above her vagina, which she had shaved at the start of the weekend. which explained the itchy sensation and made her decide to ditch Panties from now on<br />
<br />
her hair had grown shorter again, though less dramatically then yesterday, just slightly above her shoulders rather then slightly past it, the feel of it had changed drastically though, feeling less like her hair had, and more like long fur, and as she turned around noted that it had also started to spread: following her spine and working its way down her neck where it stopped, similarly the fur around her tail had also started making its way up her back, likewise following her spine and making it slightly over half way on her lower back, like with her legs, she was fairly certain the two patches of fur creeping along her spine would meet up before the day was over. noting with some exitement that she was fairly certain that come wednesday evening, she would be walking around all but naked, possibly on all fours, wearing only her new fur<br />
<br />
after putting a new change of clothes (minus her panties) back on she made her way back to her master&#39;s bedroom, where she immediately started planning, including writing a note for Jeff to find once her changes were done, just in case, as she turned towards her plans for Jeff&#39;s new harem<br />
<br />
Alice was a no-brainer, she was openly bi and had expressed interest in a polygamous relation multiple times, and thanks to the reality changes poly relationships were a lot more accepted in society she would be the first, and likely easiest to recruit<br />
<br />
Sarah recently had her boyfriend gift himself to her as her new vibrator, having been unable to keep up with her near nymphomaniac libido, but still wanting to pleasure her as much as he could (she was fairly certain Sarah had him inserted for the entire day yesterday, she could smell it) like Alice, She was bi, and while not explixitly interested in a polygamous relation Frank was accepting in having an open relation, with Sarah and Frank participating in multiple threesomes and even a few flings to keep her libido tamed, she was failry sure Jeff, Frank the Vibrator, and his other future girlfriends could keep her libido satisfied, she&#39;d need at least 2 girls and Master Jeff into this before she could consider approaching her which made things, tricky she wasnt sure when she would lose her human voice, but she would lose it before the week was up (and she wrote as much in her note for Jeff), once again the thought sent her tail wagging fiercely<br />
<br />
Oliver was a tough one, she was fairly sure the soon-to-be-girl was straight as an arrow, but she&#39;d heard multiple times Yesterday that a transition such as this tended to blur the lines, at the very least being part of a harem/polycule was one of his interests and she was pretty sure she could appeal to her that way, she was pretty certain she could recruit him today if not tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Katie was going to be tricky, she was a friend of her&#39;s and jeff but not of the other girls, save for Oliver,  and adding her would likely be entirely on Master Jeff and his future Girlfriends, as she was currently the anatomical doll of the biology room at school, and she would be for at least 2 more weeks as part of an extra credits assignment, and by that time Jenny herself would be firmly into doghood. that said though, the teachers pet was all for new experiences, and would likely join as soon as she heard of it, and might even change herself on the regular, she was as adventurous as she was studious and despite appearances, a kinky one to boot, having shared all kinds of kinky thoughts that bounced around in that brain of hers with Jeff and herself, most of which were now possible thanks to anatomical alterations and the various other body changing services that existed now (not to mention the Chronoviac, though she resolved to make jeff promise to keep that hidden until he was absolutely sure he could trust his future girlfriends with the device. the potential for abuse was too great.)<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
When Jeff was woken by his alarm the first thing he saw was his now dog eared ex-girlfriend/dog exitedly waving at him, stiiting in fornt of his couch and wearing only a shirt (and bra he assumed) and going entirely bottomless, showing off her new furry hips and naked pussy, behind which her tail wagged exitedly. Jeff noted some arousal at the sight of his future dog&#39;s naked pussy but not nearly as much as when she was still human.<br />
<br />
As Jeff dressed himself Jenny obediently waited as she sat on the floor, noting with some slight amusement that she was already sitting on the ground like a dog would. Once dressed, Jenny stood up on her now Digitgrade stance and aproached him a slight bounce in her step as she walked with her new legs &quot;Master Jeff&quot; Jenny said &quot;when I woke up, I had a few concerns that I would like to be laid to rest.&quot; Jeff nodded and motioned for her to go on &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking, dogs only have a lifespan of about 10 years, and while I already love that I&#39;m becoming a Dog for Master, I do not want to die within 10 years. can you make it so me and anyone else who changed in this reality keep their human lifespans?&quot; Jenny asked<br />
Jeff thought it over, it was true they didnt have an explicit end date set for her transformation, which was something Jenny insisted on, and Jenny did bring up a good point, he could change her back in 9 years and if he wasnt careful, she&#39;d already be an old lady by human terms, or worse, he could have forgoten entirely and the introduction manual to the Chroniviac explicitly mentions that it cannot bring the dead to life (save for the recently dead, but only if death was set as a trigger to transform back to normal)<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, i&#39;ll make the changes, anything else you wanted me to change?&quot; Jeff asked as he made his way to the Computer<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, though I am curious, how int- int-smart am I going to be when my transformation is over? the int-ro-duc-tion video and our own inputs only said I would be highly smart for a dog&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, noting her difficulty with bigger words &quot;Ok, let me make the changes first.&quot; making the age changes was easy, and while he was at it, added in a reversion clause for Jen&#39;s tranformation,to be triggered upon death when dying from anything not age related as a precaution which would transform her back to human in a safe location, in addition to the manual reversion that was already there, not to mention the various &#39;normal&#39; reversal options this reality offers<br />
<br />
It took some searching both on the Cronoviac and the internet before Jeff turned to Jenny: &quot;So, it looks like the average inteligence of permuted animals is an IQ of 80 which is sightly below the lower threshhold of average human inteligence. And you, Jenny, are set to have an IQ of 95, which is high for a permute pet, but below the average for a human, in addition, some things like undertanding words becomes harder as the animal instincts gain a tighter grip of your mind, but according to what I found, you and any other permute pet within the average human intelligence threshold, which is 85, should still be able to write and read basic sentences with some training&quot;<br />
<br />
After a short while Jenny nodded &quot;I&#39;m not opposed to that master, I&#39;m happy that I&#39;ll still be able to com- commu-talk with you even as a dog if I need to&quot;  her second though, that she didnt voice, was that it was good news for her harem plan and it was possible that bringing in Katie wouldnt need Jeffs help<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded &quot;Now, lets stop sitting around, and get our breakfast before we go to school.&quot; jeff said, before a stray thought hit him &quot;also, have you gone to the toilet yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did yesterday before we went to sleep, and I&#39;ll do it before we go to school today but I&#39;m farly confident i&#39;ll be using the garden by tomorrow, if not this evening&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, lets go downstairs, I&#39;m going to make you a bowl of food, and I&#39;m pretty sure I saw that dad bought some doggy treats too, if you&#39;re a good girl at school I may give you a few&quot; Jeff noted with amusement at how much her head perked up at the mention of treats<br />
<br />
And with that, the two made their way to the kitchen.</p>
