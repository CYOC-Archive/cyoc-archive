<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eli Hunt and Randy Halton were out on the town, looking for a good place for a party that night. Eli was very much the &quot;jock&quot; of the duo - a tall, blond hunk, Eli had bright blue eyes and a bulging, muscular frame that made a definite impression in all of his clothes. As of now his tanned physique was fit into a vest, tank top, tight jeans, and a pair of boots. Eli was tall, about six foot three inches in height total. His personality definitely matched his look, as he was known around the college campus both guys attended as a loud, cocky presence whenever he was around.<br />
<br />
Randy Halton was on the other hand at least initially a rather withdrawn nerdy guy with windswept dark brown hair, green eyes, and somewhat pale skin. He had been skinny and a few inches shorter than Eli, but starting when they became friends, Eli had helped Randy get into the gym. What had started as an unhealthily skinny physique turned into a very fit, trim athletic body that astonished those who saw Randy with his shirt off. While he still wore nerdy logo shirts, jackets and pants, he was downright built where it counted, though he didn&#39;t have the kind of size Eli did. He still had to wear his glasses, but he was reasonably okay with that at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Eli said with a grin, &quot;That girl at that last party was like, so into you! Soon as she saw your abs she couldn&#39;t get off of you!&quot; He clapped Randy on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
Randy chuckled, &quot;Well, I hope I showed her a good time when we got some alone time. Takes more than a set of abs to be a good lover.&quot; Randy said with a wink, and Eli chuckled somewhat dumbly a bit. Tell the truth, Randy still felt somewhat insecure about his looks, but was confident that in time he could be as hot as Eli.<br />
<br />
But before long as the two looked for the next party they were due to hit up on their crawl around town, they found themselves walking by a strange door that seemed built into an old abandoned building. Strange, Eli thought for a moment, as long as he&#39;d been here that building had been abandoned, though going by the sounds inside...<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I think we found our next party!&quot; Eli said, audibly excited. He started pushing Randy toward looking at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, yeah I see it! Kinda weird if you ask me,&quot; Randy said, contemplative even though it sounded like a lot of people were in there having a lot of fun. Didn&#39;t seem like Ted&#39;s party, the one they were actually supposed to be heading toward...but why look a gift horse in the mouth?<br />
<br />
That was when the doorman arrived, and both Eli and Randy were almost dumbstruck by the sheer attractiveness of the man, even though neither of them had expressed any interest in men before in their lives. Randy felt like his mouth had gone dry, and he couldn&#39;t keep himself from looking at this man outfront. His attention span went from examining the party going on through the crack in the door to focused entirely on the door man. Meanwhile, Eli had grinned lasciviously despite himself, feeling that if he felt this good about this nothing could be wrong. Eli openly and obviously groped at his dick, which was quickly fattening and becoming more obviously aroused.<br />
<br />
The man simply seemed to chuckle at these displays of lust, and then announced to the two young men, “Enter, changing to someone completely new and experience the best night of your life. Or leave.” He knew on some level he would not have to exert much effort with these two.<br />
<br />
Before he even finished speaking, Eli was hungrily moving forward. Randy shortly after, a few brief attempts at touching and getting through to Eli fading into following him into the thick of it as usual between the two.<br />
<br />
The door man opened the gate to the party, and both Eli and Randy were astonished by the sights and sounds around them. A throng of people on the dance floor that they never knew, they recognized nobody here from among those attending college with them, and nobody seemed to recognize them. The air was thick with an odd mist to it that seemed to make Eli grope himself again and Randy adjust his collar as he felt what seemed like a drug hit him.<br />
<br />
Randy was used to some of the more rambunctious party drug affairs, but none of them he was experienced with had ever made him feel quite this...excited. Readily feeling up for some kind of thrill. He went from feeling ill at ease somehow even as he couldn&#39;t pinpoint where the loud music was coming from and the fact the music didn&#39;t seem entirely human at times, to joyfully dancing a bit in place to it.<br />
<br />
Eli offered even less resistance, and chuckled outloud, putting an arm around Randy&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Dude, this place is sweet! We gotta frequent this establishment from now on! I swear they got like weed in the air or something cuz I&#39;m feeling high, bro! Let&#39;s find some chicks to bang!&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy didn&#39;t see anything wrong with it yet, and so he and Eli went ahead and started mingling with the people on the floor, who seemed more interested in their dancing and grinding on each other than any form of conversation. Which for Randy was a bit of a turn off, but for Eli? He just jumped right into it. Randy guessed it was normal to feel a tingly feeling when he was getting dosed like this by stuff in the air, and didn&#39;t think much of it.<br />
<br />
Randy found himself being fawned over by a group of young women, dancing fluidly around him and feeling his musculature through his shirt. Even as he danced and found himself taking off his jacket to hang up on some...something on the wall...he found himself gasping as one of the women pinched his ass. &quot;You...you&#39;re gonna make me fuck you deep tonight doing that!&quot; He wondered if that might be allowed on the floor...<br />
<br />
Eli was happily dancing with his own crowd of women, who likewise appreciated Eli&#39;s muscles, but also seemed very into his appearance otherwise, running hands through his hair, complimenting his tan and handsome features, playing to his ego. And Eli loved having his ego played to. &quot;Babes, you can see all of me that you want tonight. I&#39;m gonna give you the night of your lives!&quot; He too ignored the tingling feeling starting up on him, guessing it was just his body reacting to whatever fine mist was in the air. Felt pretty nice too, so Eli was not in a hurry to sound the alarm on this feeling.<br />
<br />
Randy found himself surprised when the girls started to get him to take his shirt off as the dancing went on, &quot;Ladies, ladies, I&#39;m...I&#39;m not that ripped...&quot; But as he did so he felt oddly like his pants were tighter on his quads, ass and calves. Had he done a little too much leg day the prior day? He looked down at himself as the shirt came off and was tossed away, seeing his muscles looked all around somewhat larger and more toned, his abdominals resembling a turtle shell somewhat - the way some of those bodybuilder guys looked. Never his favorite look, but here it was. And what was more, running a hand over himself he could feel he seemed...hairier. &quot;Wha---???&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli was in the midst of what was probably the lead up to some sort of sexual escapade. He felt so incredibly good just standing there, getting adored and worshiped by these women around him. By now they were touching him all over, and Eli had shed his shirt long before Randy did. The girls were even touching his nipples with the same urgency they gave his shoulders, his groin and his butt. Eli was outright moaning from the sensations. His body was slick with sweat, his mind clouded by ecstasy. He never knew that his nipples felt so incredibly good. He was gonna have to get his next girlfriend to do nipple play on him next time. He didn&#39;t even notice how his nipples seemed to be becoming more pronounced, how longer his hair was looking, the way his body hair was retracting, or the fact his face was changing from masculine handsome to more pretty handsome - almost androgynous.<br />
<br />
Randy was trying to lose himself in the party atmosphere, so as not to worry about what he told himself was just him tripping out. He didn&#39;t want to alarm or harsh Eli&#39;s mellow, so he just went along with what was happening. And what was happening was pretty good. Randy danced along with the women, who seemed to be becoming more and more flirtatious over the course of the dance. Randy was almost losing himself in it. &quot;Ohh fuck I feel so...so weird...&quot; He was drowned out however by the women moaning &quot;Daddy...&quot; &quot;You gonna go home with me, Daddy?&quot;, things like that. Randy&#39;s face was visibly aging, hairline retracting and slight wrinkles showing on his face, but the effects of aging more made Randy look damn good. A build that was great already became sensational - material for a contest win in aesthetics. Randy was approaching his mid to late thirties with allure and grace both.<br />
<br />
Eli on the other hand was going down a much different path. The sheer sensations were escalating, becoming almost overwhelming. &quot;B-Babe, my nipples can only handle so much...&quot; Two women were licking and even took Eli&#39;s nipples into their mouths, his dick poundingly erect in his jeans. Eli tried to keep dancing, but there was only so much he could do. While Eli&#39;s musculature would not be decreased or endangered by the change, it would affect him regardless - his face becoming more and more feminine while retaining some aspects of his masculine edge. His strong pectorals completed their shift into a burgeoning pair of breasts - still tight alluring and strong, but bouncing now instead of firm. Eli&#39;s ass grew out, his thighs becoming more prominent, his hair a little longer and wavier.<br />
<br />
Randy looked around and saw what looked to him from the distance like some sort of topless female (???) bodybuilder dancing with a bunch of other women. He didn&#39;t even recognize his friend immediately. He just kept going in his own little clique on the floor. While he was dancing as he enjoyed with the women on the floor, his body was definitely aging now. Looking more like a 40 year old man, nonetheless Randy did not have what anyone would call a &quot;Dadbod&quot;. His physique if anything honed itself even further as he danced the night away. His hair thickened a bit more on his chest and abs, but it was still trimmed enough to make his physique obvious. This was a man who kept himself fit throughout his life.<br />
<br />
Eli by now was starting to feel funny. There was something definitely odd going on. And it was so odd that he seemed to only just be coming out of what could best be described as a pleasure fugue. He murmured to the women around him, &quot;Hey...hey, I uhh, I gotta excuse myself. Be right back!&quot; Eli started to head toward the bathroom...<br />
<br />
&quot;Be back soon, sis!&quot; Eli&#39;s eyes darted back over when he heard that phrase used in his direction. Surely they couldn&#39;t be referring to him! Eli tellingly kept going and walked into an empty men&#39;s room just past a bar, hearing someone whistle at him. He tried to find who it was, but the floor was still rather crowded so he couldn&#39;t find out who it was making those noises at him. When Eli entered the bathroom, he was absolutely surprised when he saw what looked like a heavily muscled er...chick?<br />
<br />
Eli moved and the person in the mirror moved too, and a dawning realization compounded by his experiences out there made him realize exactly who he was looking at. Immediately Eli pulled his jeans and boxers down, frantically checking if his masculine organs were still there. He felt a sinking sensation, dreading the idea that he might have a pussy down there instead of a---ahhh, he sighed with audible relief. His cock and balls were still there!<br />
<br />
Eli groped them in the mirror just to check for himself and true to form, they were there. The same date-pleasing size his dick was before, and his balls just as full and ready to go. Like nothing had happened. When just looking at the mirror again, Eli could see his lips were thicker, his hair longer, his face more feminine, and his breasts! Geez, he knew he preferred women with a sizable bust, but these things were generous if not truly excessively so. Probably C Cup size. &quot;Always talked about wanting tits on demand to touch, didn&#39;t know I&#39;d get em this way...&quot; As Eli touched his new breasts, he started to feel an odd sensation in his genitals.<br />
<br />
While his cock responded as it should, Eli looked down and pushed his balls up a bit. He could see what looked like a wet pussy just behind his balls and slightly built into the back of the sack. &quot;That...that just isn&#39;t normal...&quot; Eli murmured to himself. He could even tell his voice was lighter and less deep than usual. There was still a bit of his usual voice in there, but he definitely sounded more feminine.<br />
<br />
He looked back to his reflection and pulled his jeans back up. Eli could also see as he started to examine his back and butt that there was a blue tattoo on his back he didn&#39;t remember having going in here. Huh...was pretty sick, but he didn&#39;t ever remember having one like it. Eli flexed his back and chuckled, &quot;Still got all my muscles, even if I look kinda...weird now.&quot; Eli wondered if the women out there would still be into him...<br />
<br />
Despite the look of being rather like a topless woman and his face being androgynous at most generous guess, Eli shook his head. Just because this happened didn&#39;t mean anything to him. Sure he had boobs now, but this wasn&#39;t gonna change Eli&#39;s identity. He was a man, and even if this was how he&#39;d be experiencing things for some time, he wasn&#39;t gonna wear a bra or panties or anything like that. He had lived the life of a man, he had gone to college a man, and a man was what he was going to stay. Physical changes did not equate to mental ones.<br />
<br />
Eli breathed, thinking about what to do. It sounded like the party was still going out there. <br />
<br />
Stepping outside and not making an effort to put on a top, Eli found himself trying to get back into dancing. It seemed like nothing changed since he went over there, and either nobody noticed he now rocked a pair of tits, or nobody cared. Was this kinda thing normal in here? He ended up seeing some of the girls he danced with now dancing with an older guy. Looked about 45, but was in frankly astonishingly good shape.<br />
<br />
Eli approached the guy, swearing he knew this guy SOMEHOW from somewhere. Was this guy some kinda famous instagrammer? Bodybuilder type? He looked like he competed or something. &quot;Hey...uh, dude, do I uh, know you from somewhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older guy turned and said, &quot;...Maybe? Did I dance with you in here? You misplace your top? Name&#39;s Randy Halton.&quot; He separated himself from the people dancing on the floor to talk to Eli. It seemed he was mostly into the dancing going on. Definitely in his area of expertise.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t---wait, what the fuck, Randy!?&quot; Eli almost tripped over himself when this buffed out older bodybuilder introduced himself as Randy, when Eli knew Randy as---wait. Did this mean Randy had been going through changes as well? Eli crossed his arms in front of his chest, &quot;Dude, it&#39;s me, Eli!&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy almost stumbled from this and looked Eli over, his eyes staying on his best friend&#39;s new endowments a bit longer than he should&#39;ve, earning him a light shove from Eli. Randy gasped, &quot;E-Eli!? Seriously? You look...like, seriously, I almost can&#39;t believe it! You&#39;re like, a chick!&quot; Randy paused for a moment, and blushed a bit, &quot;You...know, Eli, you probably should put on a shirt or bra or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli angrily shook his head and responded, &quot;I am not putting on a shirt or---fuck, fuck no, no bras. I&#39;m a man, and I can have my shirt off if I want if off. Nobody here seems to mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what happens if you don&#39;t turn back? You gonna go out tits out on the street?&quot; This made Randy start to wonder about something else, &quot;...Dude, did your dick uhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli felt the front of his jeans and made his dick more prominent, &quot;I still got my staff and two jewels. I&#39;m a guy.&quot; He looked Randy over again as he figured he should mention it, &quot;Also, I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s changed here. You&#39;ve uhh, you got older, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy gulped, and felt himself up with his hands. He could feel that his body was much hairier than he was familiar with, and that his skin even without the hair felt weathered and less supple and soft. He was assured just by touch that Eli was telling the truth. Randy asked in a voice full of trepidation, &quot;H-How...How old? How old d-do I look?&quot; It was a plain request for the damages.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like a 45 year old man, dude.&quot; Eli responded, and it looked like Randy was verging on a ranting episode. Eli really felt sorry for Randy. Sure he got a million dollar body out of the deal, but all the complications that came with age... Eli didn&#39;t know how worth it Randy was gonna find this.<br />
<br />
Randy held his head in his hands. He was nowhere near ready to be this old, he didn&#39;t want to give up the lifestyle of the youth he knew. He glanced up at Eli and said, &quot;Well...I dunno how permanent this is gonna be, but I&#39;m not letting this stop me. Let&#39;s finish up dancing here.&quot; Even though it seemed now that they looked like the dancing was winding down, Eli and Randy both nodded at each other.<br />
<br />
By the time the dance floor was mostly empty, Eli walked out from where he&#39;d been dancing with a couple women on the floor, visibly sweaty and grinning with exultation. His manhood was half hard now, having enjoyed his time without giving too much thought to his newly hermaphroditic look and biology. He could see Randy getting done as well, and on Randy&#39;s muscular back there was a similar tattoo to what Eli was rocking.<br />
<br />
Remembering what Randy said earlier, Eli reluctantly picked up his tank top shirt from where he left it and put it on. Much less fitting than when it simply had pecs in the chest area, but it&#39;d do the job of covering his chest. Whether he wanted to or not, there were laws out there. As the two left, they overheard the doorman speak from it seemed everywhere and nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;The tattoos represent the transformation - it will last as long as they do. You may restore the tattoo, however faded, to restore the changes.&quot; And with that the two of them headed out.<br />
<br />
Eli asked Randy, who still enjoyed his shirtless stride (also driving up Eli&#39;s jealousy), &quot;Hey dude, how long do you figure this tatt&#39;s gonna stay on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I know, bro.&quot; Randy said, concerned. He didn&#39;t know if people were gonna remember the two of them differently or if the world hadn&#39;t changed or some shit like that, but the fact was, Randy was like 45 now. How could he conceal that and live the life of a student? And Eli? Eli was like, a hermaphrodite now.<br />
<br />
Eli was in fact contemplating that right now. He had no intention going out there to change how he identified. He was a man! But there was the fact he could probably need to change up how he handled romantic encounters. Let alone how he presented himself in public even outside of his sexuality. Well, at least he wasn&#39;t at all bad looking, and the change let him keep his muscles. So working out would be...fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Eli asked, looking around and taking in the odd fact it was just an hour and a half later than when they went in, &quot;What do you wanna do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lemme see...let&#39;s...&quot; Randy said with a contemplative look on his face.</p>
