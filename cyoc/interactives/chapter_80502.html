<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Helen's stomach suddenly growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Roy asked as Darryl and and Diane looked around curiously. Helen was a little embarrassed that she didn't eat anything before they came, she immediately spotted a restaurant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh-hey, let's check out what kind of food they have at that place.&quot; Helen suggested pointing to it. Helen hurried along first as they rest of her family followed her in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you guys think we should get?&quot; Roy asked Diane and Darryl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not really sure, I mean, I'm not that hungry.&quot; Diane stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, hello, I'd like a sausage pizza, four hot dogs, some popcorn, ice cream, and four large sodas.&quot; Helen said all in one breath to the cartoon lady behind the register.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay ma'am, that'll be 32.69.&quot; The cartoon register lady replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Roy, please pay the lady.&quot; Helen said to her husband as he slowly just came up to the register and took out some cash.<br />
<br />
Helen directed her kids over to a table and they both sat down. Darryl and Diane were both quiet as they watched their mother fidget as she sat in her seat. Helen's fingers shortened from five fingers to four, making her pinky finger disappear. The stranger thing was that her skin was turning a shade of dark blue with the exception of her face, which became more of a baby blue. Her ears expanded to grow just above her head and morphed to look like mouse ears. Her nose shrank down to practically toward her face to look like almost nothing more than a pink dot and two whiskers grew out of the side of her nose. To complete her new looking ensemble, a dark blue tail sprouted from the back of her skirt. Darryl and Diane were surprised to see that their mother was now a cartoon mice.<br />
<br />
Helen then noticed her kids looking at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; She asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, nothing.&quot; Diane answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot; Darryl started before Diane nudged him on the arm. Helen just rolled her eyes at this and looked to find where Roy now was.<br />
<br />
What the kids or Helen didn't realize was that Roy was turning into a cartoon mice again as well.<br />
<br />
'I can't believe the first thing that happens when we come here is that Helen makes me spend a fourth of our vacation money already.' Roy thought to himself being a little annoyed. Roy was too busy watching for his family's food to even notice his skin turning a chocolate brown color while his face became a pale brownish white. His nose, like Helen's shrunk down to almost a pink dot with whiskers popping out on each side. His ears expanded to almost go above his head, then morph into mouse ears before a tail popped out of the back of his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's your order sir.&quot; A cartoon woman behind the register said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Roy thanked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And may I just say, you look good.&quot; The cartoon woman said winking at him.<br />
<br />
Roy chuckled at this and blushed a little before taking the tray of food to where his family was sitting.<br />
<br />
At their table, Diane had noticed a few other people looking at her mom and wondered if she would look that good as a cartoon mouse. Her skin turned into the same color as her hair while a tail popped out of her pants. When her transformation was complete, she did notice a few of the guys her age were now looking at her.<br />
<br />
Darryl didn't want to feel left out and morphed as well, with most of his body becoming the same color as his hair and a tail coming out of the back of his pants too.<br />
<br />
Roy finally found his family and sat down at the table with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roy! You're a mouse again!&quot; Helen shouted shockingly when she saw Roy come to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, wait a minute, wasn't this a family decision?&quot; Roy asked as he looked around the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you-&quot; Helen was suddenly shocked to see her children as cartoon mice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe all of you.&quot; Helen said disappointingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really mom? Because you're the one who started it.&quot; Diane said to her holding up a compact mirror to reveal she was a cartoon mouse as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this is just great Roy, our vacation is already ruined.&quot; Helen said to Roy as she put her face down in her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;But mom, the point of all this was to have fun and what could be more fun than being a cartoon?&quot; Darryl asked rhetorically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being chased around by a mechanical cat murdering machine sure sounds like fun.&quot; Helen said sarcastically as she rolled her eyes and began eating her lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see mom, we'll show you and dad that being cartoon mice can be a blast!&quot; Diane said as she munched down her lunch.<br />
<br />
Helen had her doubts.<br />
<br />
When lunch was all over the family decided on...</p>
