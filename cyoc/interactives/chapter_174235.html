<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the longest time, Nate didn’t know what to do, he was overwhelmed he had grandparents, his parents where on their way, he had a sister and the love of his life Rose was by his side. Sure he didn’t really know if his college education in computer engineering had any real use under the sea but none of that matter. <br />
<br />
“Let’s take this outside…I enjoy going for a swim.” Said his grandmother the retired Queen of this merkingdom as her husband, his grandfather and former King nodded his head. He moved a little slowly as he reached over and grabbed a U shaped handle from the stand by the chair. He hit a button on the top and a blue glow began to radiate from the bottom. <br />
<br />
“I guess under the water a cane wouldn’t be much use.” Said Rose as his grandfather nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Yes, at my age I can’t keep myself leveled in the water as easily as I would.” Admitted the former King as he seamed to stand a little bit better in the water with the cane then he did without it. <br />
<br />
Nate focused on him, he did look like an older version of himself, at least from the waist up, his grandfather’s tail was a mixture of faded gold and black. It seamed thinner and weaker then what he had seen as the normal. His grandmother grabbed a similar “cane” as her tail was a dull red and her hair had a few flecks of brown in a sea of white. He wondered for a moment, where he got the orange of his tail, however then he remembered that his mother had orange scales on her tail.<br />
<br />
“Maybe a good swim to the North Palace…I am sure your folks will be heading there.” Said his grandmother, that caught both Nate and Rose by surprise, but Amara spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Grandma…Grandpa maybe we shouldn’t try to take that far swim.” advised Amara<br />
  <br />
“None sense…if we get tired you can call for a transport.” Stated the former King as he began to move slowly toward the door. The guards outside snapped to attention and moved in front of the former King to clear the hallway. He stopped by the door and took his wife’s hand as they began to move down the hallway.<br />
<br />
“Wait…I thought this was the Palace?” inquired Rose<br />
<br />
“No this is part of the East Palace grounds, there is the North, South, West and Central Palaces as well.” Explained Amara “All together the Summer Palace and it’s grounds cover about 20 Kilometers by 20 Kilometers.”<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Nate his mouth opened; he wasn’t totally sure but he believed that was over 12 miles each way. <br />
<br />
“Most of it is now a museum, Grandma had this part renovated into a state nursing home for veterans and the poor and they decided to live with them. Only the Northern Palace is totally off limits to the public and remains a royal residence in full.” Stated Amara “That is where mother and father are going to meet us in a few hours.”<br />
<br />
“Then you can enjoy a nice swim in the meantime.” stated his grandmother as she poked her head around the corner, causing all three younger merpoeple to jump a bit. “Come on or are you going to fall behind a 146 year old mermaid.”<br />
<br />
“Coming grandma.” Said Nate, the words sounding strange in his mouth. He moved out into the hallway. <br />
<br />
“Take your grandma’s hand.” advised his grandfather as Nate nodded as he offered his arm as his grandmother took it as they journey down the hall. On the other side Amara took offered her arm as their grandfather took it as they journeyed out the retirement home.<br />
<br />
“We will be a while, have a transport standing by.” ordered Amara to the nurse who nodded her head and watched the retired King and Queen left the center and started down one of the many paths. The royal guard flanking out and making sure everyone stayed a little back.<br />
<br />
 More than a few mermaids and merman noticed that the retired King and Queen where out an about when word was that they were in failing health and that is why the current King and Queen were rushing here. They also noticed that the Crown Princess was with them and two unknown merfolk. <br />
<br />
“Well…I guess there be no hiding you for much longer.” stated Amara <br />
<br />
“You worry to much about dealing with the press Amara…somethings it is better to do what is right then to deal with the press.” stated her grandmother “So Caine…I have to ask you where a human correct?”<br />
<br />
“Yes…I didn’t know about all this until a few days ago.” Admitted Nate “I must admit I am used to answering to Nate.”<br />
<br />
“Nate….” laughed his grandma before shaking her head before lowering her head in shame. “Nathan was my father your great grandfather’s name…I guess my son had a worse sick of humor then I thought. He always hated having a former human as a mother…those radicals.”<br />
<br />
“Honey you can’t fault yourself for him, I should have saw it as well.” added his grandfather “I should have done something…it would have avoided the years we lost while you were taken from us.”<br />
<br />
“Nothing can be done about that now.” said Nate <br />
<br />
“No…but please tell us about yourself.” said his grandmother, as they made a turn and entered what looked to be a large perfectly manicured coral garden. Nate told them about his life, brushing over some the worse stuff, he didn’t want to make his grandparents sad. Rose just swum behind them letting this family reunite. They moved slowly as they journey across perfectly manicured gardens and what looked to be tall bio illuminated seaweed which rose up like trees in the park. <br />
<br />
Nate asked some questions of his own, turned out his grandmother had been born in Savannah Georgia in 1874 to Sea Captain from Boston and the daughter of a fishermen. When she was 18, she went on a trip with her father to see her grandparents up in Boston. There ship went down and she found herself on the same island. On his grandfather side, he came from a line of kings which dated back tens of thousands of years. There where heroes and some villains in the line, he was amazed that until 10 generations ago the Kings where considered god Kings and only when his great grandfather did the Kingdom become a full Constitutional Monarchy.<br />
<br />
“I know it is very scary but give it time, you will both adjust to the changes.” Reassured his grandmother as they rounded around some tall shrubs. <br />
<br />
That is when Nate and Rose saw it, it was a massive building which had to be at least four or five story tall with a long series of colonnade running down the side of the building. On the other side of those columns where massive stain class windows. What looked to be a doom rose from the center area of the building but given the angle they where looking at it was impossible to know for sure.<br />
<br />
“That is the old South Palace.” Said Amara as she laughed a bit at the amazed look on Rose and her brother’s face. It got worse when they noticed a matching building a little bit off. “That is the West Palace, we will be passing through the central palace in a little bit.”<br />
<br />
The center palace was a work of wonder, it was shaped like a pyramid with large crystals seaming to float in the water. Large statues of some of the greatest Kings and Queens, of heroes stood in a large + shape hallway which ran through the heart of the pyramid with paths leading toward each of the four matching palaces to each of the cardinal directions. They spent a while in the hall, letting Nate’s grandparents explain who was who and what they did. <br />
<br />
Rose sat down on a bench beside Nate’s grandmother, Amara had taken off to deal with something and Nate was talking to her grandfather looking up at a large statue of a mermaid with a crown on her head. The first Queen to rule the Kingdom in her own right. <br />
<br />
 “Don’t let pressure get to you.” Said his grandmother as Rose looked at her slightly confused. “My granddaughter is right, the press will be after you both of you once they find out that he has come home. So don’t let the pressure get to you, remember you will be married to the man not the crown or the blood line.” <br />
<br />
“I’ll remember that…thanks.” Confirmed Rose with a smile</p>
