<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milton--his name was Milton? He shook his head, trying to remember who he’d been, but there was nothing. Just <br />
his new memories of living in the small, dingy room of Mr. O’Brien’s house. While he did his best to digest <br />
this, Madame Ilusia came forward once more. “Well, Milton here has a new name to go with his new body, <br />
however, we still need a job for him to do. After all, Mr. O’Brien can’t have him living in his house rent <br />
free! Who has a job that they think Milton will be capable of doing, that they would like to give him? He <br />
doesn’t have much left to exchange for it, but I’m sure he has a few more things he can give up.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I might have a job for him,” a man said, stepping forward. He was clad in a set of filthy overalls and <br />
rubber boots, and Milton could smell the stench of manure hanging around him in a cloud. “I been mucking out <br />
the stables at Mr. Wellington’s pig farm fer years now. However, I’m tired of working in piles of shit all <br />
day, ‘n I’d like to try my luck in the big city. I’ll give Milton here my job, in exchange for thirty points <br />
of his IQ, and his cleanliness. See, I’m none too bright, and always dirty. No one in the city would hire me <br />
like this.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, that much is true. What do you say, Milton? I think our friend here deserves a shot at city life, don’t <br />
you? Wouldn’t you be willing to help him out? Besides, looking like this, I doubt anyone in the city would <br />
hire you either.”<br />
<br />
Milton fought against the compulsion, but the words came out anyway. “Alright, it’s a deal.”<br />
<br />
The headache that followed only last a few seconds, but it was excruciatingly painful. Milton hadn’t been <br />
nearly as smart as his brother, but with an IQ of 100 dropping to 70, when the pain receded, his head just <br />
felt...empty, his mouth open and drooling a bit into his new beard. The stench of shit which had floated <br />
around the man now swam around Milton, and his body was crusted with dirt and grime. His hair and beard had <br />
grown out into a thick bush around his head, and with his tongue, he felt that half his teeth had rotted out <br />
of his head. The Madame took a few steps away from him, waving away his powerful musk with a sneer, making the <br />
audience laugh and jeer at him, but Milton didn’t know what was wrong. He had a hard time trying to follow <br />
what was going on, and he was wishing everyone would speak slower, so he could understand what they were <br />
saying. “I no...understand, what goin’ on...” he said, mostly to himself.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry Milton, we’re almost done. Last call--is there anyone else who has something for Milton here? <br />
It’s slim pickings at this point, get something now, or get nothing at all.”<br />
<br />
“I have something else for him, and I know what I want for it too,” another man said, lumbering forward. “See, <br />
workin’ in a barn, shoveling pig shit, he’s liable to get real cold doing that kind of work, especially if <br />
he’s naked and it’s almost winter. Well, I happen to have some insulation for you, if you want it, Milton.” <br />
the man said, jiggling his belly, and looking around at the laughing audience.<br />
<br />
Milton didn’t quite know what the man was saying, but he didn’t want to be cold. “Uh, ok...I no want tah be <br />
cold.”<br />
<br />
“Well hold on Milton, this isn’t a charity. You have to give this nice gentleman something as well.”<br />
<br />
“I know what I want from him already,” the man said, “I want his youth. I want to be slim and young again, so <br />
give me your youth, and you can have all of this padding for the cold winter.”<br />
<br />
“That sound good to you Milton?”<br />
<br />
“I...I guess so.”<br />
<br />
“Then it’s a deal!” the Madame exclaimed, and the audience watched as Milton began to inflate up on stage. The <br />
man had to be close to 400 pounds, and all of it melted away in the course of a minute, leaving him amazingly <br />
trim, and even a bit muscled, the clothes he’d been wearing now tented around him. Milton, for his part, was <br />
soon finding it difficult to stand with the extra weight, and he had to splay his legs out a bit, to make room <br />
for his massive, sagging gut falling down over his groin. His beard now grew wider, obscuring his triple <br />
chins, and his brown eyes were buried in in his fat cheeks. Still, he was warm, though the sweat accumulating <br />
in his fat rolls did nothing to make him smell better. Finally, he felt close to thirty years pile on him, his <br />
hair and beard becoming almost entirely grey, the hair receding far back, revealing the scalp of his head, <br />
face full of wrinkles, his eyesight becoming even worse than it had been, but he didn’t need to see much in <br />
order to shovel shit around. The previously fat man looked down at his young body and let out a hoot and a <br />
holler. He might have cartwheeled out of the tent if his clothes had fit him.<br />
<br />
Anything else?” the Madame asked of the audience.<br />
<br />
“We have a couple of requests to make,” a young man said, one pulling the second behind him. We want to help <br />
keep Milton warm too.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well I think Milton already has enough to keep him warm, boy,” the Madame said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well, he can’t just be goin’ around naked, can he? He has to be covered by something. Well, my brother <br />
and I, we’re both the hairiest guys we know. We’ll give him all of our body hair, in exchange for two things. <br />
I want five inches off Milton’s cock there, because we don’t want him flashing everybody with it, and my <br />
brother here, well, it’s real bad see. He’s a mute, and I want him to have a voice. Milton can have our hair, <br />
if I get his cock, and my brother gets his voice.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, well those are both good arguments, I suppose. How about it Milton, do you want to make one more switch?”<br />
<br />
Honestly, he didn’t, but he didn’t have much choice. “Yes Madame, I take the deal.”<br />
<br />
“Good boy,” she said.<br />
<br />
Looking down, Milton saw that his entire body was filling in with light brown, curly hairs, enough so that <br />
barely any of his skin was visible. As far as he might be concerned, he would be plenty clothed for the rest <br />
of his life. His cock shrank up into his fat so far that he’d never be able to reach it. He tried to say <br />
something, anything, but all that came out were some strange, animalistic grunts. He looked like an animal, <br />
and now he spoke like one too.<br />
<br />
“I can...I can speak?” the mute said, and his brother pulled his close, both of them ecstatic.<br />
<br />
“Well, I think Milton here has given away pretty much taken everything he can hold from all of you in the <br />
audience. Alright Mr. O’Brien, he’s all yours. Take your new boarder home, so he can get to bed--he has to be <br />
at work early tomorrow!” The Madame said, and the room laughed, well, everyone except for Mr. O’Brien.<br />
<br />
“What? I don’ want this filthy animal stinking up mah house!” Mr. O’Brien said.<br />
<br />
“But that was the deal, Mr. O’Brien,” the Madame said, the room falling silent, sensing the tension in the <br />
air, “And I can’t let you back out of a fair deal. Think of the life this beast gave your son, in the city. He <br />
gave him his name--name’s are very important, after all--they can change a lot in a person.”<br />
<br />
“Well yeah, he ain’t my son no more for one thing, since he don’ even have my name!” Mr. O’Brien said, “I <br />
don’t want this monster livin’ with me, and I’m not takin’ him.”<br />
<br />
The tent was silent, as the Madame fumed a bit. “Come up on stage, Mr. O’Brien.”<br />
<br />
Mr. O’Brien realized then that he shouldn’t have spoken up, as his feet walked him up onto the stage. This <br />
close to Milton, he could smell the stench wafting off of him, and it was even ranker than he’d imagined, and <br />
he started to retch a bit.<br />
<br />
“Now Mr. O’Brien, relax. After all, you must be used to your son’s stench by now, after living with him all <br />
these years,” Madame Ilusia said.<br />
<br />
“He’s not my son, what are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
“Well, it occurred to me that Milton here doesn’t have a last name. He needs a family, doesn’t he? And you no <br />
longer have a son, so I think Milton here would gladly fill that role, isn’t that right?” She asked, turning <br />
to Milton, and the fat, hairy brute nodded dumbly, unable to disagree.<br />
<br />
“Well, he ain’t my kin, he doesn’t even have my blood.”<br />
<br />
“That much, I suppose is true. The two of you don’t look very much alike, but surely there’s something we can <br />
do about that, right Mr. O’Brien? Like son like father, after all.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not...it’s the other way around.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think not. After all, Milton’s hair is far too thick to not be some hereditary trait, I think. And <br />
surely he would have had to pick up all of those bad habits, the lack of hygiene, the overeating, from <br />
someone. And seeing as you’re the only family he has, I must assume that he got all of it from you!”<br />
<br />
O’Brien felt the wave of magic the Madame had been building up crash over him with the Madame’s final <br />
pronouncement, and he looked down at himself, watching his body begin to swell up with fat, stretching the <br />
limits of his clothing in a matter of moments. His entire body itched, and he could feel his beard and hair <br />
pulling themselves out of his body, growing longer, but also filthier. With several loud rips, the clothes he <br />
was wearing were nothing more than rags, and to the audience there was no question that the two men on stage <br />
must be related. However, where Milton’s middle aged body was covered with brown hairs tinged grey, Mr. <br />
O’Brien’s new pelt was nearly white, the only bald spot on his whole body being the complete crown of his <br />
head. “No...No, what have you done to me?” Mr. O’Brien said, running his dirty hands over his furry body.<br />
<br />
“Now, now, don’t fret. Tell me, do you have any problem taking your son home with you now? Look at him there. <br />
Smell him. Doesn’t he smell good? Aren’t you proud of your son, that he can hold down a job, and that he can <br />
come home smelling like work? That makes you happy, doesn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Mr O’Brien did his best to fight Madame’s words, but the wormed their way into them with a sinister logic. He <br />
was proud of Milton, sure. It wasn’t easy looking like they did, and also getting by in the world. But he <br />
didn’t actually like how he smelled, did he? I mean, the boy stank of manure, and yet...there was something <br />
appealing about it, and considering his own horrible hygiene, why shouldn’t he enjoy his son’s musk as much as <br />
he enjoyed his own? Yeah, he did like it, and there was no shame in that, no shame at all. He loved how his <br />
son came home stinking of barns and manure and sweat. It was a measure of his manliness.<br />
<br />
“Now go on, show your son some affection. Show him how proud you are of him. It’s natural for men to be <br />
attracted to their sons, after all, especially when they bear all of their best qualities. You love Milton, <br />
don’t you? Don’t you want to show your son how much you love him? How proud you are of him? Don’t you want him <br />
to feel good?”<br />
<br />
Mr. O’Brien felt his feet start to move his massively fat frame closer to his son’s. He did love him, he loved <br />
him so much, and he was so very proud of the big man he’d grown up to become, just like his father. They <br />
embraced, and before Mr. O’Brien could stop himself, he was kissing his son, their foul breath mixing, and he <br />
didn’t mind. In fact...he was enjoying it. He could feel his cock, just an inch long, like his boy’s, start to <br />
harden and leak a bit of cum, matting the fur on the underside of his gut. Milton was just as excited, his <br />
hands groping under neath his father’s gut, looking for his cock. They couldn’t reach their own after all, so <br />
the pair had grown accustomed to getting each other off, and had been doing it for so long they loved it, and <br />
each other, all the more deeply. Still, in what remained of Mr. O’Brien’s mind, he knew that this wasn’t the <br />
place for such a display, and so, reluctantly, he pulled away. “Alright son, let’s go home--ya gotta get tah <br />
work in a few hours.”<br />
<br />
Milton nodded, and the two of them left the stage, their stench cutting a path through the crowd, which had <br />
imagined they were safe, but no one renegaded on a deal with the Madame--no one.<br />
<br />
“Now then, do we have another volunteer?” the Madame said, sweet as sugar, but the audience could sense that <br />
she was just getting started, and that none of them were safe from her bargains, deals and swindles.</p>
