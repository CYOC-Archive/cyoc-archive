<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">things were peaceful as this went on for ages. soon though, 8 years rolled by that it was her 16th birthday, and the day of her coronation. the court mage was now in charge of the paper works and guests that everyone near and far from across the lands of the lords and ladies, to the enchanting beast of all kinds from the sky, the land, and of the sea as they came to hail their new princess for it seamed to be a glorious day.<br />
<br />
things were turning out smoothly as there were newer faces arriving while some of the lords and ladies ate their fill and danced for they each gave her a gift on a table in the grand hall, even the elves and so on that even the princess&#39;s enchanted beast friends from wolves, foxes, badgers, bears, and deers, to raccoons, rabbits, birds, porcupines, otters, and so on for they to were talking amongs their own and dancing, even an alligator joined in. the only thing missing to make this seem great were her true parents as they somehow went missing. still, Sir john Braveheart as he was once her german shepherd anthor knight wearing medieval clothing while Ciela, the jaguar were by her side when the toad with a crown and a red cape that next to the toad was a beautiful swan with a lovely pendent on from their neighboring kingdom of the forest soon came by for her coronation day.<br />
<br />
following behind was a human size red dragon, as it was the same one many seasons ago. before the dragon had a chance to step into the hall is when Ciela step away from her side for a moment and mead up with it. Ciela remembered what the dragon had said as she wanted answers about it.<br />
<br />
THEN-&quot;if only Igneel, the dragon king himself could see how grown you&#39;ve become. still, even if what he talked about to that nasty prince was true, we dragons won&#39;t allow it to happen.&quot; the dragon said as Ciela, the jaguar was stun by this that it soon flew away.<br />
<br />
NOW-the dragon explained that an evil prince wants to do nasty things to this place as the dragon king made an alliance with her father for it was the king who saved the Igneel&#39;s life, more then what the he could count. leaning in to her that the dragon told her something which made her heart almost stop a beat for it was this dragon who lasted seen the two coming back. after telling both Ciela and Braveheart, who later came to them as the dragon was sent from the dragon king to be with her that on the way there one day is when the nasty prince attacked the king and queen with some dark magic while also seeing a bright light from it, but when the light was gone is where things which were happening there were gone, like it was never there.<br />
<br />
fearing the worst, they made a few guards on post for anything strange. everything seamed to be going along alright that it wasn&#39;t long though, for a dark cloud had descended upon the kingdom with a dark purpose. it wasn&#39;t long till soon a stranger entered the castle when he appeared out of the blue that he looked like an anthro style 1994 Scar, but without the tail as he was wearing Jafar&#39;s 1992 outfit while with him were two chained looking evil dogs from hell with two horns on its shoulders for one had a horn on its head.<br />
<br />
everyone gasped for his appearance arrival. his name was Rathbar. we thought he was holy beast-man, but soon found out that he was a fraud as he was a power and dangerous.<br />
<br />
&quot;why! it&#39;s Rathbar!&quot; a fairy said in a soft, yet fearful voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;what douse he want here?&quot; another fairy said in a soft, but angry tone of voice to him. a third though shh them while waving its wand at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;well now, quite a glittering assemblage King John Braveheart. Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...&quot; he begins to say when he saw the enchanting animals from the forest and laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;...oh, how quaint. even the rabbles.&quot;he then said as a hog took this as a insult, but was held back by an alligator by its tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;how dare you step into the palace! stat your business here sir.&quot; a guard said that was standing next to the mage. the mage was stroking his beard as he didn&#39;t see him on the list of invites.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... i&#39;m his confidant.&quot; he said to the guard while also looking at the mage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Confidant?! HA! You are a nothing more here then a traitor! GET OUT!!&quot; another guard said as his legs were shaking in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;guard, enough!! let him speak.&quot; John said while raising a hand up to ease them a bit. as this was happening that the two demon dogs were looking at the princess as they were vicious looking, but at the same time had fear in their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;thank you. I really felt quite distressed for not receiving an invitation.&quot; Rathbar said.<br />
<br />
&quot;you weren&#39;t wanted.&quot; fairy from before said in a soft, yet angry tone of voice towards him. hoping he would leave by this news.<br />
<br />
&quot;not wa...&quot; he began to say in the shocking news of this. soon though, he sighs and laughs it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh dear, what an awkward situation. I had hoped it was merely due to some over sight. well, that event i best be on my way.&quot; Rathbar said as he slowly turn to show his leave, but knew they would ask something to stay longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;and.. you&#39;re not offended by this?&quot; Ciela asked that it made Rathbar stay just a bit longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;why no your majesty. and to show I bear no ill will, I, too, shall bestow a gift upon the princess.&quot; he said that the two shield her from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;that&#39;s ridiculous, go.&quot; a guard said. knowing the guards were no match that in the kingdoms defense, they rose against him.<br />
<br />
&quot;are your guards telling me what to do?&quot; Rathbar asked. more guards soon arrived as they were no match for him when he turned eight of them into mice that he quickly spotted the red dragon and had an idea for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;you&#39;ll see i&#39;m not, messing around.&quot; he said. with an evil laugh, he soon got to work with his plan.</p>
