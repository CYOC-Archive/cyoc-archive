<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Little did Alison know that a bunch of foals and yearling donkeys were watching and feeling very sorry for her, and they came closer. One of the yearlings, sniffing Alison&#39;s mane, was about to touch her as she suddenly stopped weeping and saw the curious animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Alison&#39;s cry of surprise caused restlessness in the little donkeys and they began to bray and jump. &quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t want to scare you. It&#39;s not your fault... but you don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve been through,&quot; Alison told them.<br />
<br />
The young donkeys found it strange to see one of their own talking instead of braying. But at the same time they liked how her sweet human voice sounded and that began to reassure them.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Emily realized something: many of those donkeys were Alison&#39;s height, so those little animals were the age of them... their now donkey age. Alison was slightly taller than the foals but she was not as tall as the yearling donkeys. It meant that Alison was now a foal, she could pass for a newborn foal! Regarding Emily and Stephanie, they were the size of a yearling. It seemed that being around 10 human years old is equal to about 2 years of a donkey&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
A yearling rubbed its muzzle on Alison&#39;s left cheek and another placed its muzzle on her ribs nudging Alison. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What happens to you?&quot;, asked Alison to the little donkeys.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s not obvious? They want to play with you,&quot; Stephanie said understanding the donkey&#39;s behavioural signals and wagging her tail with excitement. &quot;Come on, don&#39;t be shy with them. I&#39;ll accompany you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie stepped forward and entered the group that greeted with merry brays, she responded with a not so loud bray. Stephanie was taking it all very well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Emily... should I?&quot; Alison turned to see Emily. <br />
<br />
Emily first thought that playing with those young animals might make Alison behave more like a donkey. But Alison looked so sad that Emily thought that having fun with them would be good for her, she was going to take that risk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do as Stephanie says.&quot; Emily said a little dismayed.<br />
<br />
Without much thought, Alison lunged towards the group of little donkeys, gave a loud bray and began to chase them. She began to look happy. <br />
<br />
The group of young equines dispersed and started running around the adult donkeys who had stopped to rest and eat some grass. Stephanie and Alison looked so happy that Emily wanted to join them to play, but the leadership instinct that Emily now possessed forced her to stood firm there watching over Stephanie and Alison. <br />
<br />
Stephanie and especially Alison were having a great time. Stephanie was being chased by a male yearling circling around a adult jack. When they stopped, Stephanie and the little jackass stood nose to tail and began to nibble each others&#39; backs. As a human girl, Stephanie had never done something similar like that, but something inside her was telling to do it.  Meanwhile, Alison was playing a kind of leapfrog game where the foals tried unsuccessfully to jump over themselves, they always ended up one on top of the other. Emily giggled seeing Alison trying to leap over a female foal, Alison only could place her forelegs on her new friend&#39;s back, it looked like Alison wanted to mount her.<br />
<br />
However, there were games that Emily didn&#39;t like her. The one where they forcefully bit a friend&#39;s ear and they pinned the ears back or that one where they turned the rump towards the other donkey and kicked with firm resolve to see who kicked better. But Emily observed intrigued how Stephanie was enjoying raising her hind legs in preparation for a kick and how Alison was trying to grab a foal&#39;s ear with her snout. Stephanie and Alison were acting like true animals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alison! Stephanie!&quot;, Emily said worriedly. &quot;I think you girls already had enough fun with them, don&#39;t you think? I think it would be better if you came here.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Emily was the leader of them, because she was the jenny with the most powerful braying of the three former girls, Stephanie and Alison instinctively obeyed, stopped playing (Alison reluctantly) and rejoined Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, I must tell you that ... errr ... there came a moment when ... I don&#39;t know how to tell you this. Don&#39;t be offended. But there came a moment when I thought you were real donkeys.&quot; Emily told them both.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Easy!&quot; Alison replied. &quot;We just had a little fun, that was it. Humans also play with baby animals. I had a puppy that I ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not the same, Alison!&quot; Emily said alarmed. &quot;You were kicking and biting each other. Would that do a human girl?  Do you think I didn&#39;t see you biting that yearling&#39;s tail, Alison? I think it&#39;s best if you don&#39;t play with them again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison felt sadness and shame, her long ears fell toward the side and she lowered her gaze to the point of crying. The one who didn&#39;t say anything was Stephanie, in fact she lay down in front of Emily to cool off on the grass still with some dew after so much running and exercising.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie? What&#39;s wrong? Are you feeling bad?&quot; Emily turned her gaze to Stephanie concerned, Stephanie looked at her and only curled one of her ear. &quot;Did you understand that we must control ourselves if we want to be human again? Our instincts get stronger and stronger and we can no longer ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HAWW-HEE! HAAWWW-HEEEEEE! HAW-HEEEEEEEE!!!&quot; Stephanie brayed to Emily, raising her upper lip and showing her big set of teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie!&quot; yelled Emily. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAWWWWWW!!! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW!&quot; They were one of the truest brays Stephanie had ever done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie... haven&#39;t you lost your...? Oh, no ... oh, no, no, no! Stephanie, try to resist!&quot; Shouted Emily. &quot;Please speak to me. It is just what the Coachman wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HAW-HEEE ...&quot; Stephanie seemed glad of what had happened.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the goal of the Coachman had been made by Stephanie herself by acting like an ass again. Stephanie had lost her voice, now there was no physical sign of her humanity remained. And although she retained her human memories, anyone could swear that Stephanie was just an ordinary female donkey foal simply because of the way she looked and acted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Resist your urges! Don&#39;t let the Coachman win!&quot; shouted Emily again. &quot;No please, Stephanie! Don&#39;t give up! You are not a donkey! You are a human girl!!! A GIRL!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily started crying. Stephanie got up and started licking her right cheek to reassure Emily. Then, Stephanie started eating the grass and began moving around as much as she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, Stephanie!!! The Coachman did it! You&#39;re a real donkey already!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Stephanie didn&#39;t feel burdened or insulted by those words. She actually felt proud: she was already a real donkey... and she continued grazing.<br />
<br />
Emily didn&#39;t know what to do. Ever since she met Stephanie, she saw her donkey instincts getting stronger in her... and then she started saying that having a donkey life wouldn&#39;t be so bad. It was a losing war and it was also a matter of time, in the end Stephanie&#39;s weak human mind was going to be defeated by animal desires and impulses like the other girls on Pleasure Island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Other girls?,&quot; thought Emily. &quot;So that&#39;s... Alison!!! Alison?... Alison where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily had lost sight of Alison. Emily worriedly turned her head around trying to find her. Alison was not far from there, only she had decided to get closer to one of the foal friends she had played with a while ago. The donkey foal was next to her mother, feeding on one of her teats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; Alison said to the suckling young donkey, he barely noticed her presence but still Alison started talking to him as if he were a good friend of hers. &quot;I see that you are busy. Well, I wanted to tell you that my leader told me that I should not play with you again. And although I had a lot of fun with you, I should not do that. And that is because... believe it or not I am a human being, and humans don&#39;t play like that... well, sometimes we do play like that, that&#39;s why now I look like that... but I shouldn&#39;t do it anymore, I&#39;m sorry. &quot;<br />
<br />
Alison watched as the little male ass kept drinking the milk. It was when Alison felt a new impulse, something that caused her to get closer to the jenny&#39;s udder little by little. In no time, Alison felt hungry and thirsty, that was when she understood everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! No way! I will never drink from there!&quot; Alison was about to walk away when her stomach began to rumble. She then saw again the two teats of the donkey, there was one used by the foal and another completely available. &quot;What am I thinking?,&quot; Alison wondered. &quot;Only baby donkeys drink donkey milk, and I&#39;m not a donkey and I&#39;m not a baby, in that matter I must not give in... although on second thought... humans also drink donkey milk, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Alison got on the other side of the mother donkey, where was the available tit, and Alison began sniffing the udder. It was at that moment when Alison impulsively put her mouth on the tit and began to suck milk.<br />
<br />
At that precise moment, the adult female donkey was surprised to feel that someone other than her foal was drinking her milk. She turned her head and saw Alison suckling hard, flicking her ears up and down and wagging her tail happily. The mother donkey was about to abruptly bray at the intruder, and perhaps then kick Alison away, but immediately the adult jenny stopped, she began to feel compassion and empathy for Alison... especially empathy. The mother had heard Alison&#39;s human voice when she was grazing, she had discovered that Alison was not a real donkey... like her. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s right. That adult jenny had also lost her humanity on Pleasure Island when she was a child. She knew what Alison was going through, although the donkey mother was not so lucky. She managed to escape from her masters until her adulthood and later she adhered to her current herd. Now, the only help she could give little Alison was some of her milk, so she let her eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alison! Stop drinking that!&quot; Emily yelled when she found Alison.</p>
