<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amelina struggled to contain her rage, she felt like she wanted to stab her &quot;brother&quot; without end with her enchanted rapier, specially made for killing dragons.<br />
<br />
Rei noticed that her hands were shaking, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Rei whimpered, as he looked down and closed his eyes, waiting for his little sister to take his life.<br />
<br />
The sound of a metalic object echoed through the cavern, Rei opened his eyes and looked at his little sister, who was on her knees sobbing, &quot;Amelina, please stop crying... It&#39;s all my fault, you know that it pains me when i hear you cry.&quot; He said as he went near to his sister and cheered her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-When you started hunting down dragons, i was worried that you could lose your life at any moment in any d-day...&quot; She sniffed, the stutters in her speech only made her sob even more, &quot;I-I never heared of a dragon t-that could change other p-people in dragons...&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Amelina was angry at herself, deep down she blames herself for what happend to her sister, she blames the order she was in, they restricted every movement, &quot;A-And it&#39;s not your fault, it&#39;s mine, i knew i should&#39;ve come with you when hunting dragons, curse the order...&quot; she finished, Rei didn&#39;t know what to do, so he decided to improvise, he quickly hugged his little sister, asuring himself that he wouldn&#39;t harm her in the process then whispered to her ear, &quot;Great power comes with a price.&quot; he said, Amelina quickly stopped crying as she laughed a little, &quot;I can just recall our father telling you the exact same thing.&quot; she quickly hugged him, feeling his warm scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know i may be in a diffrent form, but deep down i&#39;m still the same person you knew.&quot; He said, as he stroked the beautiful long golden hair of his sister, &quot;Do you still belive in me?&quot; he asked as he retreated from the hug, Amelina looked at him and then said with a smile, &quot;Yes... Yes i do...&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
Rei smilled, hearing the response of his little sister, &quot;Now, why don&#39;t we go home? It&#39;s late, and i can see that you&#39;re tired.&quot; he said, Amelina also wanted to go home, but there was something about this cavern that grabbed her attention, &quot;I kind of want to go home.&quot; she said, &quot;But... After you told me about this cave i feel like i want to explore it a little bit more.&quot; she finished, Rei sighed, &quot;Fine... Don&#39;t blame me if you feel hungry, get scared or fall asleep in the middle of the exploration.&quot; he said grinning, revealing his sharp teeth, &quot;I&#39;m not a baby anymore!&quot; shouted Amelina, Rei grinned only more, &quot;To me you still are.&quot; he said, noticing that Amelina&#39;s face was getting more red as she was beginning to get angry, &quot;I&#39;m more powerful when it comes to magic!&quot; she said, as a small orb of fire appeared on her hand, Rei gave a serious look for a second, &quot;Oh so we&#39;re gonna switch to this now aren&#39;t we? Well then.&quot; he thought then spoke, &quot;I&#39;m taller, i also can fly AND breathe fire.&quot; He said with an obvious trace of sass in his words, by just hearing this Amelina felt her blood boil, she quickly punched her brother&#39;s leg, who gave a loud laugh in return, &quot;STOP LAUGHING!&quot; She yelled, demanding Rei to stop laughing, he quickly stopped and said, &quot;Gosh... It&#39;s just like old times.&quot; he finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, instead of verbally fighting on who&#39;s better at that or that, let&#39;s explore this stupid cavern.&quot; Said Amelina, as she looked for a way to go deeper in the cavern, she saw a small crack in the stone, &quot;Rei can you come here please?&quot; she asked, Rei quickly went near his little sister, covering his body with his black wings, &quot;What is it?&quot; he asked, she then pointed at the small crack, &quot;Put your claw in it.&quot; she said, Rei was hesitant at first, but then he places his claw in the opening, they both heared the sound of stone moving, they both quickly went back to the entrance and saw that a way was open, Amelina and Rei quickly looked at eachother and quickly nodded, they both entered deeper in the cavern.<br />
<br />
They&#39;ve been walking for minutes, &quot;Gah, it&#39;s so dark!&quot; shouted Amelina, Rei mentally chuckled as he thinked about messing with his sister harder, &quot;Really? Weird, to me it&#39;s as if the sun was outside!&quot; he said, with another obvious trace of sass in his words, Amelina felt like she was gonna snap like a twig, &quot;Fuck you too!&quot; she said, &quot;Ugh, you&#39;re the dragon with the most sass i&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life!&quot; she finished, Rei only chuckled, &quot;Thank you! And you&#39;re the most adorable person i&#39;ve ever m- OW!!&quot; He said, only to be cut off when he felt something press against one of his tails, &quot;Amy, you&#39;ve stepped on my tail!&quot; he said, Amelina only smiled, &quot;Hah! That&#39;s what you get for being so sassy around me!&quot; she said, Rei knew that this was coming, &quot;Ugh, it&#39;s to dark... I think we should leave this cursed place.&quot; she said, Rei only got frustrated and said, &quot;...Honey, you&#39;re a mage.&quot; he said and quickly heared his little sister face palming herself, suddenly the cavern was lit up by a fire controlled by Amelina, &quot;I&#39;m dumb.&quot; she said, Rei chuckled and said, &quot;No you&#39;re not, we just got heated up in the argument and forgot to cast your magic.&quot; he said, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot; he finished as he and Amelina went deeper in the cave.<br />
<br />
Rei and Amelina were walking for hours, it felt like the cavern was not ending, Amelina was getting angry by the second, &quot;Is this darn place gonna end?!&quot; she shouted, only to hear her own echo, Rei smilled, he didn&#39;t feel tired, he actually felt really good, he was soon cut off as a cloud of bats appeared from the gloom, he heared his sister scream as she fell down, he chuckled and quickly reached his scaly hand to help his sister, who quickly shook the dust off of her clothes, Rei chuckled and said, &quot;What a baby you are.&quot; he said, Amelina felt like she was gonna pop a vein due to her anger, &quot;Shut up...&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
She and her brother kept walking, untill she saw a light, &quot;Rei look! So there was something deep in the cavern!&quot; she said, Rei gave a surprised look as he and his sister quickly ran towards the light, and saw...</p>
