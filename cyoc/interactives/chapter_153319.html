<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark waited a bit to see if anyone figured what Mitch turned into, but nobody said anything, not even mentally. Aidan and Jeremy had no idea and Jacky and Johnny were to sunken in their misery to even notice what was happening around them beside pain when one of the babies hugged them with to much pressure.<br />
Just as he wanted to continue, however Mitch himself asked: “I don´t have an idea of what your goal is with changing me, but I can guess that whatever it is is something inanimate or at least not with me in control, right?”<br />
Mark smiled at that. “Yes, without energy it would be an inanimate object. Therefore at the point were your tailbone had been will grew a plug with an extractable cord. Said cord will vanish inside you when not plugged in else it can be rolled out to forty meters at most. All that&#39;s left inside you by now from your neck down will change into a material that is self-cooling to store said energy as a battery without a solid form.”<br />
Mitch turned pale, his horror only increasing to unimagined highs. He could feel his body hollowing out further, including his organs this time. His heartbeat increased until it suddenly stopped due to it vanishing. Then his body filled again with some kind of liquid gel. If he had any control of his body it would be shaking from the cold sensation, but so only his teeth clatter loudly. Then with a yelp of pain Mitch noticed something pushing out on his back just above his belt.<br />
“Next we will fix your clothing to something more fitting for your new purpose. It will change into an formal black suit fitting for a butler, with will be your new role. In the back will be a hidden hole were your plug can be drawn out. The rest of the suit will cover everything from your feet and fingers up to your neck.”<br />
Mitch gasped in shock. A butler? Most likely a robot-butler from what his body had turned into. His clothing had started changing, beginning with his shoes. His dark blue sneakers turned into all-black dress-shoes, his socks merging with them but looked like they were still separate clothes, rolling up his legs while also turning black. His blue jeans darkened into black while changing into a silk-like material. His t-shirt turned white, split open in the front before closing itself with the newly grown buttons, ending in his belt. The sleeves grew longer until they reached his wrists. But like a liquid something washed over his hands from there before it solidified into white gloves. Then out of the white shirt sprouted a black suit jacket, also buttoned up in front of his body. The lower rear part split into two tails above his belt, hiding the plug that came out just above the belt as well but making it easy to draw it out. <br />
The others looked in a mix between wonder and shock at the changes. With how Mitch behaved normally you would think he had a butler at home, but never think he would be one. Mitch still clattered his teeth, but it was slowly getting a bit better. <br />
“Now for the finishing part” Mark spoke up again after the changes had finished “Your hair will turn silk-like, flowing down your head until reaching the shirt-collar. In your neck will be a slot to plug in an USB cable, hidden by your hair. Your stubbles will vanish as the skin smooths. We don´t need to change your face more then that. Your suit and skin will be self-cleaning and indestructible. You will be able to lift about 500 pounds of weight alone, but still be flexible when someone pushes you. Your mind will stay intact but has no influence of your body. Instead your brain will change into a set of memory chips to save your programming.”<br />
Mitch&#39;s eyes widened a last time on his own accord when he heard this. That was like he was imprisoned in his own body, something he feared from the beginning of the changes. His hair flattened on his head while it grew longer to reach his neck. He felt pain there for a moment when the slot formed, well hidden by his hair. Then his eyes shrunk back to normal size and Mitch realized that he no longer could move anything while he still felt everything. His mind winced in pain when his brain compressed itself in a block like mass before it split into several sets of memory chips. One set grew isolated from the rest, keeping his original memories and traits in his body but unable to connect to the rest because of a thin separation layer of plastic.<br />
Geoff looked shocked when he saw the light of his friends life vanish into the robot he had become while Daniel shed a few tears, no less shocked about Mitch&#39;s fate. The babies giggled while the occupants were angry at Mark for being cruel again.<br />
Mark looked up Mitch&#39;s profile again, wanting to add extras with were minimized at the moment.<br />

<br />
Sighing Mark begun to work on the file. A robot didn´t need a gender, a family name or an orientation but an owner and a programming, so he changed it. He also changed Mitch&#39;s height and weight to fit before again adding a password before hitting save.<br />

<br />
Mark was satisfied with the profile so he closed it, opening his own. There he changed his ability of memory-reading from knowing everything about the person to available on request and added Jack, John, Mitch, Daniel and Geoff to the list under Aidan and Jeremy. Then he added Mitch as well as Geoff and Daniel to his mind-reading list before saving the changes.<br />
Meanwhile Mitch was still freezing in his mind. He had hoped it would get better, but it wasn´t. He only hoped it would soon, not knowing that Mark had prevented it from doing so for him. But something other he noticed. He couldn´t remember his last name nor his gender anymore, letting him feel less human then he had after the physical changes had finished.<br />
Like with the brothers Mark then said one last thing before he removed the “Mark rules” statement: “Nobody beside the ones inside this room will remember Mitch Jones any longer. His belongings will vanish or change their owner. Mitch will be able to move again.”<br />
Geoff and Daniel didn´t know what to think of that. Mark didn´t let the world forget about Jeremy before, so why now letting everyone forget him but them? Was it while Mark would change them next and only the friends were aloud to remember each other to save them from feeling lonely? That the already had forgotten two of their friends before didn´t even cross their mind as a possibility.<br />
Mitch&#39;s robot-body could move again, but didn´t until Mark said: “Mitch move aside and wait for further orders.” Mark had pointed next to the stroller with Aidan and Jeremy, so Mitch moved over and waited for his master to finish his doings.<br />
“That leaves only you two.” Mark said. Both Geoff and Daniel gulped.</p>
