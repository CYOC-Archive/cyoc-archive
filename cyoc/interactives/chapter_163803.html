<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary woke up the next morning and immediately headed into the bathroom to check up on how far things were progressing. And he was actually surprised to see there were some differences between that day and the prior one. For starters, Gary was able to see  that his tan present on him the previous day had visibly deepened, enough that it wasn&#39;t able to be mistaken for the effects of just running around outside as part of the team. And maybe it was just him, but he was looking more cut, his muscle gut slimmed down a bit, his abs showing again after so long hiding behind a thin wall of flab.<br />
<br />
And then there were the masculine enhancements. Holy damn the masculine enhancements. For someone so attuned to his desires as Gary, and thus used to looking at his manhood, that day showed Gary a slightly thicker manhood, as well as one slightly longer. The coloration was even deeper, darker somewhat. It was incredible!<br />
<br />
What was also incredible was how Gary was only just barely able to keep himself from beating off the whole time he started his shower. His body seemed to respond more strongly to pleasant stimuli, and thus he could only barely keep himself from outright masturbating when he should be heading off to school. But he managed it, even if it did give him the meanest blueballs ever as he went down to eat his food and head out to school.<br />
<br />
Today he was wearing tight jeans, and a black stringer shirt, and Gary&#39;s mom seemed to think he looked bigger today, congratulating him on that. He was gonna need to also check out the scale once he got into the weight room today. He flexed an arm as he passed by a car, grinning a shiny grin at the pumped bicep.<br />
<br />
As Gary entered the school, he met up with his girlfriend Lucy, who outright told him, &quot;Have you been tanning lately big guy? It&#39;s looking really good on you.&quot; The compliment made Gary&#39;s dick leap in his pants, and he quietly calmed himself down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, been uh, really hitting it outside. Just me and my teeny tiny short shorts...&quot; He said, looking at her with a mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Gary!&quot; She said, lightly kissing at his lips, having to stand on her toes to do so, &quot;You know if you&#39;re going to do that I want to see it, or at least have you send some pics my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary knew well what he was going to be doing after school today, and he could not wait for the day to end so he could try out the tanning shorts. Lucy did not need to know he was basically tanning with the assistance of a magical little device. And Gary wondered how long he could go before she noticed he was looking distinctly more, shall we say ethnic.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
School seemed to go by quickly and easily, though Gary was noticing one distinct disadvantage of his transformation in addition to his libido being through the roof. His glutes seemed to be larger than usual, and made sitting in class an outright chore! He couldn&#39;t handle the inflexible and tough chairs, and the teachers really didn&#39;t like how he was shifting around in his seat. Maybe he was gonna need to ask for a bigger desk. That had been in the cards before...<br />
<br />
Making sure he headed home quickly so he could do what Lucy requested, he went inside to get a towel, some sun lotion, and his tanning shorts.<br />
<br />
Gary stripped down and took a moment to vainly admire the muscled physique he saw in the mirror. He was loving what was going on so far, and wondered if any mental effects would start to come in. Well, he hadn&#39;t noticed anything yet. As he put the shorts on, Gary headed out front to go tan and wait for Lucy to arrive.<br />
<br />
He lathered up and applied his lotion, mostly to the front, and took a seat on his towel. As he laid back and eased into it, he noted it seemed that people were stopping and looking at him, mostly people coming home from school early. A few senior girls gasping and taking some extra time to observe him, a guy thought he was being really covert in how he was looking, and a young fit couple both took longing looks at Gary.<br />
<br />
Ahh it was good to be in shape like this. Gary started to ponder what to do from here...</p>
