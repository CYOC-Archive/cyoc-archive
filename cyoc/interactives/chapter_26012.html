<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walt Reynolds was a somewhat overweight man nearly 50 years old.  His beard and what was left of his hair were salt and pepper.  His life had been hard, having joined the army during the Vietnam war he was one of many guys who got seriously fucked up while in southeast Asia.  He'd gotten shot, but as luck would have it, it wasn't debilitating.  The scars Walt carried were on the inside.  He'd come back from the war with severe post traumatic stress and as a result couldn't hold down a job for very long.  He spent most of the 70s and early 80s working at menial jobs that would pay for his crummy apartment and beer.  Walt drank a lot of beer; it helped him sleep back then; kept him from waking up screaming in horror at what he'd seen and what he'd done.  By 1985 Walt hit rock bottom and was on the street, he even considered going to D.C. and blowing his brains out in front of the Capital Reflecting pool, his last view that of that needle that pointed to Heaven, release and peace, but he'd pawned his service piece for money to buy booze.<br />
<br />
Walt learned all about the milk of human kindness by living on the street, he learned that the milk had dried up long ago or had turned sour.  Snot nosed rich kids paid bums to half kill themselves so they could tape.  In later years, one of those snot nosed parasites would make millions from a tape like that.  The country he'd so bravely fought for was sick and Walt decided to drink himself into death to be finished with it.<br />
<br />
But that was not to be, a vet just like him picked him up off the street one night.  He took him into his home, gave him food and got him off the bottle.  Slowly, he rebuilt Walt's self-respect and now Walt was on his feet, in his own apartment, sober and 'alive' again, he was even starting to work out and rebuild what he could of his wasted old body.   <br />
<br />
It wasn't glamorous work and a few of the 'privileged' kids treated him like shit as he went about his duties, kids who weren't even a twinkle in their dad's eye when he was surrounded by death and pain, but it was work.<br />
<br />
Walt liked the locker room, it always smelled of youth and manhood and it reminded him of his long ago football hero days, when he was a full back and part of the team that took the state championship.  There had been dreams then, dreams of college and the NFL.  The memories were bittersweet, but Walt would take that over just bitter.  Something about being in a locker room with those smells invigorated him, like taking in the youth through smell.<br />
<br />
Walt noticed the place had a distinctly musky scent. There seemed to be a pool of liquid in the shower that wasn't water and some even slopped on some of the lockers.<br />
<br />
He moved towards it, unaware that his pants were tenting from the aroma.  <br />
<br />
The smell was obviously sex, one of the young jocks had come on one of the lockers.  Walt got a disgusted look on his face as he examined the thick liquid clinging like a gel to the locker door.  The smell was overpowering this close, musky, animal… arousing.  Walt rubbed his crotch and noticed his erection for the first time.  He hadn't been this erect in years.  Thinking about the young man who had left this here, his strong masculine animal scent had him aroused, his head was buzzing with lust.  Walt didn't know what possessed him to do it, but he wiped most of the come off the locker with his hand, he unzipped his overalls and spread the youth cream all over his hairy chest and belly.<br />
<br />
Walt didn't regret it, it felt good.  It felt warm and made his skin tingle.  He put his hand to his face and rubbed it into his beard, cupping his hands over his nose and mouth, drinking in the aroma of youth and masculinity and then, he did it.  His tongue reached out and licked his palm.<br />
<br />
Walt felt the tingle on his tongue; the taste was sweet, tangy, slightly bitter and salty.  He had tasted his own many times and this was definitely different.  His chest and belly felt warm and as he was lost in the scent and smell of the fluid, he ignored the growing hair on his chest.  Walt needed more of that elixir and there was still some on the locker.  Walt, his brain on fire with need licked the locker door clean.<br />
<br />
His sense of smell seemed to be sharper now, he moved from the locker to the shower where the larger puddle was.  He kicked off his shoes, removed his overalls and stood naked and hairy in front of the pool of come.  He ran his hands over his chest and for the first time noticed the extra hair.  It felt good as he ran his fingers through the thickening fur.  Walt wanted to rub that goo all over his body.  He sat down right in the middle of it and began rubbing it on his genitals, his arms, his legs his face, the top of his baldhead; he lay back in it and wriggled on the tile floor to get it on his back.  He coated himself in it and licked his fingers.  His entire body was tingling and he noticed that his wrinkled skin was beginning to firm up.  More than that, his body started growing muscular.  He got up and walked over to one of the near by mirrors and looked at himself.<br />
<br />
Walt looked like he was growing younger.  Brown hair was sprouting on top of his head and filling in his beard.  His gut wasn't growing any less round, but the muscle underneath was filling it out, making him look stout and powerful.  His arms and legs were growing larger, his back widened and his neck thickened and best of all, his package was growing.  Walt began to jack his thickening, lengthening cock and as he stroked, watching himself change from 50 to somewhere in his mid 30s he shot a load all over the mirror.  It had that same youthful animal scent and Walt's mouth watered.  He knelt and quickly licked it off the mirror.<br />
<br />
His body felt hot after that, the tingling increased.  His body started growing, changing shape.  Walt watched in fascination and a little fear as he grew a muzzle, claws, fangs and more and more fur.  He felt his stubby tail emerge from the base of his spine.  He reached back with a pawed hand and rubbed it.  It was erotic, like having an external prostate gland only the pleasure was less intense when he rubbed it.<br />
<br />
Walt looked on as his body completed its transformation.  Rounded ears sat slightly higher on his head, his chocolate brown eyes looked over a muzzle that wasn't as long as a normal bear's and his mixed silver and brown beard adorned it, making it very clear that Walt was most definitely a hybrid of Bear and man.<br />
<br />
Walt was changed, but changed for the better in his mind.  He felt strong, energetic, powerful… insatiable!  He hungered for food… and sex.</p>
