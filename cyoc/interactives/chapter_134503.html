<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shortly after Elisa&#39;s explination of the mission, Luka, Karyu, Celestia, Oakmoss and the Kilin bodyguards with their dragons walked towards their private room, to think of the perfect approach for the diplomatic mission.<br />
 <br />
Luka was talking with Oliver and Ethel about her two human-born Kilin children, meanwhile Karyu held a still and annoyed look as the two hens constantly had their view on him, with their lips locked in a seductive smile, sometimes Karyu would look at Oakmoss and give him a &#39;end my suffering&#39; look, the wild drake would give a hearty laugh and smile at this, but most of the time Oakmoss would look worriedly at Celestia, who walked with her hands behind her back, just like a sergeant, the young chemist would also wear a prim expression on her face, Oakmoss could easily see that Celestia was deep in thoughts. Although she wasn&#39;t on the same position as Luka, Vaestro or Avelia, Celestia and Tammy shouldn&#39;t be underestimated.<br />
Even if Tammy wasn&#39;t completly loyal to king Adam, she was still granted a powerful position by her sister and the king, Luka would oversee the Riders, meanwhile Tammy would oversee the corsairs of the kingdom, no corsair or buccaneer would act without Tammy&#39;s authorization, she had complete control over any ship held by the kingdom, no type of ship either avian or aquatic would leave the winds or waters of the kingdom without Tammy&#39;s choice first.<br />
Even if Celestia was young, she still had a promising look, even if her father was still a lieutenant, he was still considered Luka&#39;s right hand, when Luka wasn&#39;t present in any military exercise or event, he would be the one to command it. Celestia was also one of the persons if not the only person to quickly learn chemistry, even if she was still considered a begineer, Celestia created potions and flasks that only someone who had more than ten or fifteen years of chemical practice could, she would even create special potions and flasks for the soldiers of the kingdom, greatly enhancing their battlefield performance, Adam was even thinking about giving her the position as &quot;Head of Chemical Research&quot; in the kingdom when she would become older.<br />
&quot;Celestia, are you alright?&quot; Asked Oakmoss suddenly, the teal green drake quickly bonded with his young Rider, whenever he needed her, she was there, and when she needed him, he was there.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Replied Celestia quickly as she looked at her drake with a smile, assuring him that she was fine, &quot;It&#39;s just that i was thinking about creating a potion to change my appearance to one of a human-born Kilin, since i&#39;m not in the mood to be constantly eyed down by strangers.&quot;  confessed Celestia as she looked at Oliver and Ethel, both of them were looking at her with smiles on their lips.<br />
&quot;If you do create the potion, could you please create one for me aswell?&quot; Asked Luka kindly, with a somewhat embarrassed voice.<br />
&quot;Why would you both want to switch your appearances, you two are beautiful!&quot; Said Oliver, trying to cheer up the two girls, who blushed in response.<br />
While the two Kilins were speaking with Celestia and Luka, Karyu was watching them arguing, he had to admit that Luka looked adorable when she was arguing, a smile was on his scaled lips as he watched her, but suddenly, he felt the two hens pressing themselves on his flanks, staring at him seductively.<br />
&quot;Say sweetie, would you kindly be a hen&#39;s dream drake and give us both some more clutches?&quot; Asked Astrid seductively as she licked her lips with lust in her eyes.<br />
&quot;I would gladly give birth to offsprings of such a handsome divinity like you.&quot; Said Hilda as she entwined her tail with Karyu&#39;s tail, Oakmoss stood there, at first he wanted to interfere, he didn&#39;t want to stand there and watch Karyu be assaulted by Astrid and Hilda.<br />
&quot;Sorry, but i think the offsprings i gave you are enough.&quot; Replied Karyu sharply as he gently pushed the two hens aside, even if it was a weak push, it was strong enough to almost make the two hens lose their balance, Karyu quickly went towards Oakmoss as they started speaking together, meanwhile the two hens stared at Karyu, &quot;What a drake...&quot; the two whispered.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Luka, Celestia, Oakmoss, Karyu and the Kilin bodyguards with their dragons reached the private room, waiting there were Tammy, Vaestro, Avelia and Whiskers, speaking of possible approaches for the mission.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! There they are.&quot; Said Tammy as she looked at Luka who entered the room with Oliver, Ethel, Karyu, Astrid, Hilda, Celestia and Oakmoss, all of them sitting beside the rest of the Crew and Entourage.<br />
While there, Celestia instantly saw Anija, who was looking at her with a cute smile, instantly recognizing the young girl who accidentally bumped into her.<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s the plan?&quot; Asked Luka as she took a small sip from a glass containing red wine, while also stroking the soft black scales of Karyu.<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s quite simple.&quot; Replied Vaestro, &quot;You all will enter the kingdom, and ask its ruler for an audience.&quot; finished Vaestro as he also took a sip from a glass containing red wine.<br />
&quot;And what if the ruler dosen&#39;t want to give us an audience?&quot; Asked Celestia as she tilted her head, giving an adorable look.<br />
Vaestro looked at Celestia, &quot;I&#39;m glad you asked that my dear.&quot; he said, &quot;If the ruler dosen&#39;t wish to have an audience, then you all must do something to earn the audience.&quot; said Vaestro, answering Celestia&#39;s question.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t there any other approach?&quot; Asked Ethel, with an annoyed look and voice.<br />
At first Vaestro was about to respond Ethel&#39;s question, &quot;Well, maybe i can make the ruler have an audience with us.&quot; replied Oakmoss quickly, &quot;Or Karyu could use his powers to force the ruler to have an audience with us.&quot; suggested Oakmoss, &quot;But i doubt that, most of the citizens of the kingdom practiced some form of witchcraft.&quot; finished Oakmoss.<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s the problem with that?&quot; Asked Oliver as he looked at Oakmoss with a stunned yet fascinated look.<br />
&quot;The will power of someone that practiced witchcraft is sharply increased.&quot; Answered Celestia, &quot;Maybe the leader practiced a lot of witchcraft.&quot; said Celestia, as she looked at Oliver and Ethel.<br />
&quot;Which means that the leader might be able to ignore my powers and not change their will.&quot; Concluded Karyu as he looked at Celestia with a smile, &quot;You are a really clever girl.&quot; said Karyu, the demonic dragon god didn&#39;t meet many scholars in his life, the only ones he met were Anija and Celestia.<br />
&quot;T-Thank you.&quot; Said Celestia awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, guess it&#39;s decided.&quot; Said Luka, &quot;Me, Karyu, Celestia, Oakmoss, Ethel, Oliver and their dragons will go to the kingdom and request an alliance, let&#39;s hope this works.&quot; finished Luka, as she and her group started to prepare themselves for the mission.</p>
