<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What do you mean by that!&quot; Shannon said archly. She set her plump hands on her now cumbersome hips, and glared at him. Though she tried to look angry, her rounded face and double chin turned it into petulance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just saying that the bra and panties are only going to make you as fat as you want to be. And you're easily over 400 lbs now. Do you have any repressed fantasies about fatness or gluttony? I remember you used to diet a lot in school. Maybe this is the creation of some subconscious part of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon glowered at that (which just made her fat face look flushed), and was was about to say something insulting...when she noticed that Sarah had vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did Sarah go to?&quot; she muttered, and Joe glanced around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang. She may not be used to her changes. I'll go look for her. You take off the bra and panties and get dressed again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe walked swiftly from the store, and Shannon tried to reach around and unhook the clasps of the bra. Unfortunately, she'd grown so big around, and her arms so thick with fat, that she just couldn't reach the clasps. She called out for Joe to help her, but he'd already started to look for Sarah.<br />
<br />
She was swelling. She was still swelling. She'd grown so round, fat and heavy that she didn't so much walk as waddle. She tried to remove the panties, but once again she couldn't do it. Her belly had swollen into a great, projecting ball that - combined with the ever-swelling thickness of her thighs and counterbalancing mammoth butt, kept her from being able to remove the panties either.<br />
<br />
She strained to reach her red dress (no longer could she simply bend over and do so), but at her touch, the dress started to shift and grow, changing from the tight, sexy garment she'd worn into the store...into a huge, billowy, loose-fitting mu-mu.<br />
<br />
She wasn't sure what to do, but knowing that she couldn't leave the store naked, she decided to struggle into the dress.<br />
<br />
When she saw the woman she'd become, she gasped in shock. She'd spent her whole life trying to resist her bodies urge to eat, and in just a few minutes...she'd become the object of her darkest childhood nightmares. She'd never been fat, but when she was younger she'd been a little plump, and the cruel taunts of her schoolmates had caused her to avoid every little treat or sweet, and focus on a lifelong battle of the bulge.<br />
<br />
And now...look at her. The woman in the mirror was so hugely, immensely obese that she looked like an old-fashioned Circus Fat Lady. Balloon-bellied. Zeppelin-breasted. Thunder-thighed. And now so broad from hip to hip that she'd never be able to squeeze through a normal door again. The dress didn't conceal a thing, and was so transparent that the bra and panties were perfectly visible through it. <br />
<br />
Worst of all was her face. Shannon Andrews had once possessed the sort of facial features that most people described as 'Classily Beautiful'. But now, her jiggling chins, swollen jowls and fat-thickened lips and features made her almost unrecognizable. Even her beautiful blue eyes were partly concealed, as her fuller, fatter face caused her to squint perpetually. <br />
<br />
The only thing that hadn't changed was her curly, shoulder length, dark blond hair. Aside for that - and the color of her dress - she looked like a different person.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least the...swelling seems to have stopped.&quot; she thought, and her belly let out a rather loud...rumble. That was odd, as she'd just had lunch with Joe...but she had only picked at a salad and sipped some spring water. Suddenly...she felt her acheing, empty belly needed something more...substantial.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she said aloud, waddling slowly and ponderously towards the store enterence. She had to find Joe! She had to help him locate poor Sarah! She had to make him reverse this horrible transformation! She...<br />
<br />
Shannon Andrews exited this Magic Lingerie Store that Joe was apparently in charge of...and she was stunned by the dreamy, blissful smells that wafted towards her from the neighboring &quot;Weiner King&quot;. She saw that they were running a &quot;two for one&quot; special on foot-long chilidogs...<br />
<br />
...and all her resolve vanished. She waddled towards the restaurant, garnering attention from everyone as she was now easily the fattest person any of them had ever seen, and said &quot;I'd...I'd like to have eight...no, ten Chilidogs...with cheese and onions...and eight orders of potato wedges...with extra dipping cheese.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man behind the counter was stunned by the woman's order - and a little offended. &quot;What a fucking sow...&quot; he mused to himself &quot;...no wonder she's so fat.&quot;, as he rung up her order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like something to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Super-Size Pepsi...and a couple of Chocolate Milkshakes.&quot; she said, her belly rumbling loud enough for bystanders to hear. She couldn't be bothered by them, though. She was on a roll...and nothing mattered except eating. &quot;And six of whatever you have for dessert.&quot;<br />
<br />
She waddled towards an unoccupied booth, and squeezed her bulk into the bench - easily filling it from side to side and resting her tremendous breasts on the table. The young man brought her food out to her, and she started to eat - or rather, to gorge - with relish and abandon. She seemed to enter a trance as she ate, devouring half a chilidog with one bite, then closing her eyes and savoring the mouthful like it was the finest wine. The other diners were struck dumb by the monstrous spectacle of the huge, fat lady who ate...and ate...and ate...<br />
<br />
Shannon was lost in her meal. The very first meal she'd had in her adult life that she could say she actually enjoyed. She glanced towards the  Magic Lingerie store, guzzling half her shake in one, long gulp, and watching for Joe's return. She stuffed a handful of potato wedges into her larger mouth, chewing slowly and trying to remember what she'd been thinking of before she'd started eating. It had been so important then, but now she couldn't remember. Something about eating...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, why is that lady so fat?&quot; a child asked aloud, causing Shannon to look at the little girl. The girls mother didn't even try to pitch her voice low, as she said &quot;Some people just don't have any self control, honey. That's what you call a 'Glutton'.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words were so insulting, that Shannon was shocked back to her senses! What was she doing? Her body had changed, but not her mind! She had to find Joe and make him reverse this...<br />
<br />
Her hands - seemingly on their own initiative - lifted another chilidog to her lips. She tried to stop herself, but her mouth opened...and much to everyone's disgust, she took a huge bite...then another...and another...untill the whole footlong chilidog had been devoured.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts went cloudy again. A &quot;Glutton&quot;? Was that what she was? She mused over the word, and decided that it felt right.<br />
<br />
And once again, she puzzled over something she felt she'd forgotten. Something important. Something about Joe and that lingerie store of his. She'd forgotten, but felt it would eventually come back to her...<br />
<br />
While she was waiting, she started eating the first of her six slices of pie. The whole restaurant watched as she stuffed them into her mouth one at a time, then loudly sucked the sweet residue from her fat fingers before getting a refill of her soda and waddling back to the store. She felt slow-witted with her belly so full, but she was content as she sipped her beverage and waited for Joe.She dabbed chili sauce from the corners of her wide mouth with a paper napkin, and tried to remember what she'd been so upset about. She'd been bothered by something physical...<br />
<br />
She ran her thick, fat hands over what she could reach of her nearly 700 lb body...and found nothing obviously wrong. With a shrug, she just sat back and gave her lunch a chance to digest.</p>
