<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For some reason even though she had no plans to go there Stacy found herself leaving the apartment she shared with her girlfriend Chloe and heading toward the beach. She knew that Chloe had gone to the beach this morning with Tim and Ana to meet Monica and Damon but she had decided not to journey with her girlfriend. For some reason she found herself being called to the beach and she got into her swimsuit and got into her car and within 20 minutes she pulled into a parking spot. The parking lot was about half full now but she could see her friends cars in the front row.<br />
She got her stuff and moved down to the beach and found all her friends’ stuff, however it looked almost untouched.<br />
<br />
“Strange.” Said Stacy as she took off her shirt and shorts, kicking off her sandals and stood there for a moment in her favorite black bikini. Then she just looked around at all the people and wondered again why she was here. She loved to swim like anyone else but she had been at the beach all day yesterday and was planning to spend the day working at home. She pulled her black hair back into a pony tail and just looked around.<br />
<br />
“Stacy?” inquired a new voice as Stacy turned to see a women about of age with her with long blonde hair dressed sky blue bikini top which went really well with her blonde hair and blue eyes. Stacy blinked a few times as she tried to remember this person’s name, Ana had introduced them once at a party. <br />
<br />
“Harmony right?” inquired Stacy as the women nodded. <br />
<br />
“Strange running into you here.” Stated Harmony as she placed down her stuff. <br />
<br />
“I know…personally I don’t even know why I am here, it is as if something…” started Stacy but shook her head.<br />
<br />
“Something called you here.” Finished Harmony “Me too.”<br />
<br />
“Strange.” Said Stacy as two more figures came up to them. One was another women, this one dressed in a golden one piece suit but with a red Aztec dragon imprint on one side. Her clearly mixed eastern European and Mexican descent with short brown hair in a pixie cut.   <br />
<br />
The other was a man about of age with Damon, clearly Italian decent and while not super built wasn’t bad looking either. His orange swim trunks with black highlights stood out among the more common blacks, reds and blues. <br />
<br />
“Ok…I know you don’t I?” inquired Stacy as she looked at the man, she had seen his photo before. “Your friends with Damon correct? You where his best man at the wedding if I recall correctly.”<br />
<br />
“Yes…I am Colton.” Confirmed the man “I live about two hours away…and honestly I don’t know why I am here.”<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” inquired Harmony as she looked at the other woman.<br />
<br />
“Lupe, I was Monica’s maid of honor you don’t remember me Harmony?” inquired Lupe as she looked at her. “I remember you where there along with Tim and Ana.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry I got a little drunk that night.” Admitted Harmony “So why are you two here?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Admitted Lupe as she shrugged her shoulders. “Something, a gut feeling told me to come to the beach.”<br />
<br />
“Same here.” added Stacy as everyone looked at each other and nodded there heads. <br />
<br />
Then another figure joined the group, he was a large man built like a tank with a military tattoo on one of his arms and tribal markings on the other. The design which had multiple different animals in it went from his wrist all the way up to his shoulder blade. He looked very different then the others, everyone else among the group looked like fresh out of college or grad school age, clean and with well paying jobs while this man had a dirty unshaven beard which had to be a good four inches long and smelled. He wore a dirty army shirt which had the sleeves torn off and had holes in it. He looked like a red neck trail trash from the backwoods of West Virginia or the like, but his eyes shown intelligence and sadness as well. His swim trunks where simple looking and looked as cleaner then anything else he had on but they where a dark brown.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” said Stacy kind of wondering why this man would have walked up on them like this. <br />
<br />
“Wait…your Adrian correct.” Stated Harmony “Your Tim’s friend correct?”<br />
<br />
“Yes…who are you all.” Said Adrian in a gruff voice as suddenly all five of them got a gut feeling, like something was calling them to all go into the water for a swim. <br />
<br />
One by one all of them put down there stuff and headed toward the water. This drew no one attention, they where just another group heading into the water. They reached the water and dove under but before they could come up for all all of them found themselves pulled forward in a sort of tunnel of water. It was impossibly fast and they attempted to break out to get to the surface but couldn’t. Finally it stopped as all five of them eyes widened as before them floating in the water was a blonde hair mermaid, she held a bag made of seaweed and other stuff over one shoulder and behind her where two merman armed with spears. They where not threatening but seamed to be on the look out.<br />
<br />
Stacy was the first to attempt to reach the surface but found she couldn’t. It was swimming into an invisible wall, she pressed up against it but nothing.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry I cast a spell, you can all breath in the water as long as you are within 10 feet of me.” Announced the mermaid “I am Cura.”<br />
<br />
“What…” said Stacy as she tested this claim and found she could speak and breath. <br />
<br />
“Wow…an actual Mermaid.” Said Lupe in an almost childlike wonder<br />
<br />
“What…what is happening?” inquired Colton confused like everyone else.<br />
<br />
“Well…this morning your friends Damon and Monica accidentally found an orphan merchild on the beach behind you. Through magic they where transformed into merpeople.” Explained Cura<br />
<br />
“Wait…they are merpeople?” stated Colton<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct.&quot; confirmed Cura<br />
<br />
“How could no one notice that they where missing?” added Harmony<br />
<br />
“Why would people notice, people would assume they are swimming only when the beach closes tonight will anyone notice because their cars will still be there.” Noted Adrian his voice strangely calm as his feet rested on the sand. “Until then they are just swimming.”<br />
<br />
“Correct, well sadly your other friends Ana, Tim and Chloe happened upon them and the baby transformed them into merpeople as well.” added Cura<br />
<br />
“WHAT!” yelled Stacy “My Chloe is a mermaid?”<br />
<br />
“Correct…and we can’t transform them back due to our laws and political issues…however our leaders have given them a choice.” Stated Cura “They where allowed to pick 1 human each and if you should want it, you can join them as mermaids and merman and spend the rest of your lives under the sea. The choice is yours of course, if you should choice not to I will send you to shore erasing your mind of this offer and you will only remember coming to the beach for a quick swim nothing more.”<br />
<br />
“But our friends will not be coming home correct?” stated Lupe<br />
<br />
“No…I am afraid not, the news will report them lost in a horrible drowning accident.” Stated Cura as she touched her bag, in there where the orbs which could transform the humans before her. “Same for you all whom choices to join them…so what say you?”</p>
