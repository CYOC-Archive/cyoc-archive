<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer awoke to find herself on the bus. She tried to move but found that she was strapped into an adult size car seat. Next to her was she twin sister Courtney and from her vantage point it seemed like the other former cheerleaders were on the bus too. It didn’t take long for the bus to come to a stop. Jennifer looked out the window and saw a rundown neighborhood. “What are we doing here” she thought, her question was soon answered as just then the bus driver came over and unfastened Jennifer and Courtney from their car seats. The two were lead off the bus and left to walk home. Courtney grabbed hold of Jennifer’s hand and led her to a dilapidated apartment complex. “This can’t be. What happened to our home?” Jennifer thought, panicked by the events unfolding. Courtney pulled out a necklace from between her massive breasts. Attached to the chain was a simple key which Courtney used to unlock one of the doors. Tugging Jennifer along the two stepped inside. <br />
<br />
The apartment was small and disheveled, paint was peeling off the walls, and the carpet was stained. Jennifer looked around in disgust at the state of the place. The furniture was old and beat up and the place had a funky odor to it. But what Jennifer saw next stunned her. Standing barefoot and in the kitchen was her mother. Her mother who only this morning was a sophisticated modern businesswomen was now a hot mess of a stay at home mom. She was wearing a baggy pair of dirty sweatpants and a midriff exposing tank top, her brown hair was pulled into a messy bun. But what had stunned Jennifer the most was that her mother was built just like her, Alexandra had massive breasts as large as Jennifer if not bigger and her hips and ass were equally massive. Even from where she was standing Jennifer could see her mother’s nipples thru the fabric of her tank top with big fat leaky nipples that tented her shirt and left dark wet spots.  <br />
<br />
“Welcome home honey how was school?” <br />
<br />
“It was awful! Jen turned me into a baby!” Courtney began to tear up. <br />
<br />
“Oh sweetie Jen didn’t turn you into a baby. You both had accidents that’s all.” Alexandra walked over to her daughter and brushed her hair lovingly. “There there sweetheart mommy’s here. It will be ok.” Alexandra pulled down her tank top freeing one of her massive breasts. “You look hungry baby here drink up.” With that Courtney sucked away. Jennifer’s jaw dropped seeing her mother breastfeeding her sister.<br />
<br />
“What is mom doing?” Jennifer thought when suddenly her mother stuffed her other breast into Jennifer’s open  mouth. Jennifer was in shock at first but then the warm milk flowed down her throat. It was the most delicious thing Jennifer had ever tasted, and she quickly began sucking harder for more. <br />
<br />
After several minutes both girls were full. And Jennifer had extra milk running down her chin and onto her chest. She tried to lick as much off herself as she could as her mother began to gently lay them down on the floor. Alexandra didn’t bother putting her top back on as she focused on changing her daughters.  Jennifer  and Courtney both absentmindedly began to suck their thumbs while getting their diapers changed. <br />
<br />
“Mom how did you get this way?” Jennifer finally asked. Her mother was a bit confused at first be then explained. “Sweetheart all the women in our family are well developed.” Jennifer felt a little tingle in her head before replying. “No mommy, I mean like how did we end up here? In this place. Where’s our house? Where’s daddy?” <br />
<br />
Alexandra’s expression changed to a more serious tone. “Well you see honey when you and your sister had your accidents it put a lot of stress on us. I had to quit my job to help you and your sister. And with me no longer working we had to downsize a few times. Those custom order diapers are really expensive plus the therapy sessions were quite pricey. Your father couldn’t keep up and worked himself to an early grave.” Another wave on tingling hit Jennifer as her mother was tearing up. <br />
<br />
“Daddy’s dead!” Jennifer began to cry, when another tingling sensation hit. “What! No I wish! That bastard took off when you two had your accident.” Alexandra huffed, confusing Jennifer by her sudden shift in behavior. “Wait what! Why would he do that?” Jennifer inquired, when another sensation hit her. “Oh honey I don’t know. Your father was just some guy who knocked me up during college.” Alexandra explained nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
“No that’s not right. You said you meet dad in college and after graduation you two got married and had us!” Jennifer explained, trying to understand what was going on. “Why were things changing.” She thought, when another tingling sensation hit her. “Oh honey I never graduated from college. I came here during spring break. I slept around with a dozen guys and got knocked up, so I decided to drop out and stay here. I don’t know who your father is baby. I’m sorry.” When Jennifer looked at her mom she could swear she was younger. Alexandra seemed more youthful and vibrant as she seemed to be in her early thirties instead of her mid forties.  <br />
<br />
Jennifer was scared and confused. Her mother was changing, her very history was being distorted. Her mother went from a rich, successful, married, college educated, businesswoman to a poor, single mother, college dropout slut. Jennifer had to think of something fast if she was going to fix her family.<br />
<br />
“Alright girls time for mommy to go to work. Grab your toys and let’s go.” Alexandra grabbed a diaper bag from the ratty sofa and stuffed a few coloring books in it. She walked over to the door and slipped on a pair of worn and dirty flip flops. These flip flops were well past their prime, being held together by duck tape and were full of holes. They looked to be about ready to fall apart and did absolutely nothing to protect the soles of her feet.<br />
<br />
Alexis grabbed her daughters by the hand and led them outside, locking her apartment door behind her. She lead her children to the bus stop and waited for the bus to come. She pulled out her old flip phone and checked the time. She was running late. “Please don’t get fired.” She thought to herself before putting her phone back in her bag.</p>
