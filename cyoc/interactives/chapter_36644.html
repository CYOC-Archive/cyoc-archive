<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Standing there thinking for a moment, Andrew made his choice and stepped into the light. Thinking that this was all still a game, not really able to change into a real werewolf, Andrew could not wait to accept his role as leader of the werewolf species. As Andrew stood there in the light, he felt a warmth spread throughout his entire body. This was too weird to Andrew, never feeling anything in any of the other virtual reality games that he had ever played.</Br>
<Br>Quickly, Andrew felt other things that he never experienced even in his entire life. Being twenty-four years had it's moments of extreme eroticism, but this was something more, something insanely intense to the point of explosion. Suddenly, Andrew felt achy all over, with each one of his muscles hurting slightly like he just finished working out. Then, just as suddenly as his muscles began hurting, Andrew's whole body itched, which seemed impossible to him. Slowly Andrew felt himself... change! Andrew realized that he was really going to be a werewolf! Scared, Andrew wanted to leave, but he couldn't bring himself to step out of the light. A part of him wanted what was happening, a part of him embraced the coming change and Andrew knew it was going to be for the better.</Br>
<Br>Now that the preparation stage was complete, Andrew felt something coming on, something primal. Andrew threw his head back in a yell, which sounded like a mix between something being more human than animal. Freed from whatever frustration Andrew felt inside, he felt clean and pure, like he was expunged from everything he had ever experienced in real life. Then, without warning, things began to change.</Br>
<Br>Andrew could hear and feel the bones in his body shift and change, popping as he grew in size while his muscles bulked up to accomodate his new form. Andrew felt the first bone change in his face, feeling his jawline become more rigid and handsomely framed. Next came the rest of his changes: his chest barreled out to the size a quarterback would have, while his shoulders broadened; his neck thickened; his pectorals bulged; his stomach rippled to make a six pack; his biceps and triceps bulked to seventeen inches around; his hands and fingers thickened; his thighs bulked up placing incredible strain on his jean shorts; the bulge in his crotch swelled and filled out to new sizes; his calves bulked up and became more defined; finally his feet increased in size and thickness, placing incredible strain on the fabric of his shoes.</Br>
<Br>For a moment, things settled and there were no other changes, allowing Andrew to look down at himself and enjoy what there was to see. Looking himself over in the glow of the moonlight, Andrew smiled and loved what had happened to him in seconds what years of weightlifting couldn't because of his body's internal chemistry. Andrew could feel something new build up in him, the feeling of an animal trapped in a cage and wanted to be freed. Figuring that it was the new werewolf portion of himself, Andrew released the gate and let it free.</Br>
<Br>Andrew's body bulked up slightly more than in his new human form, everything thickening up, changing for his new werewolf body. His hands shifted into paws while his fingernails lengthened and curled forming his claws; he could feel his feet do the same thing and in a split-second, his shoes tore apart and Andrew wiggled his new werewolf toes and claws getting a feel for the whole thing. As soon as his hands and feet were done, Andrew felt his face push outward as his nose flattened, darkened and grew moist, forming his muzzle while his teeth lengthened and sharpening to form his fangs. The last thing he noticed was his tongue flattening and widening while his ears grew to a point and moved up to the top of his head. Andrew, now more invigorated than ever, felt his heart beat faster and faster, pumping blood through his body at an alarming rate. Suddenly, fur... dark brown red tinted fur erupted from every pore of his body, causing his tattered clothes to shred even more with fur poking through the holes made by his change. Andrew yearned to be free from everything that made him human, so he used his claws to make short work of the remaining fabric. As the tatters fell to the ground, Andrew's larger cock and balls hung free, while his new fluffy wolven tail helped him balance in his new body.</Br>
<Br>With his change complete, Andrew threw his head back in a wolven howl of glory, happy to be freed from the bonding chains of humanity, that echoed through the entirety of the house. If Andrew's brethren were waiting for his arrival, he was sure that they knew he had come.</Br>
<Br>Knowing that he needed to explore his surroundings more, for the next piece of things being accomplished, Andrew stepped out of the moonlight and the door opened to reveal...</Br></p>
