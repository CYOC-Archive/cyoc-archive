<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mitch licked his lips as he watched from the tent flap. Andy on the other hand was getting a whiff of that delicious aroused aroma rolling off of his temporary tent mate, which was causing his cock to become even more rigid in his hands.<br />
<br />
Mitch knew what he wanted. Being bi, he had fooled around with guys before, though never while he was actively dating someone else. Still, didn&#39;t he invite Andy into his tent with maybe the off hope of something happening. What was that old line about what happened in Vegas? Well, it wasn&#39;t Vegas but the African savanna was even more distant from home.  He slipped inside the tent and peeled off his shirt, tossing it aside, trying to just act like he was entering to go to bed himself and Andy masturbating in the open was no big deal.<br />
<br />
Andy looked up, locking eyes with Mitch. In that moment he knew he didn&#39;t care that Mitch was another guy, that he had never had interest in another guy before, all he knew was the scent was driving him crazy and he needed to get off. He took his hand off his cock, instead rubbing his hand up his furry muscular stomach as he grinned at Mitch.<br />
<br />
Were those fangs in Andy&#39;s mouth, Mitch wondered as he looked the man over. Probably just a trick of the fading light, but the smile was definitely predatory. Still, Mitch found himself laying down next to Andy, pressing his lips against the other man&#39;s their tongues running together. Andy seemed both hesitant and eager, Mitch felt the same way. He traced his lips over Andy&#39;s chest, taking a moment to nip at a nipple, then down his furry abs. Finally he came to Andy&#39;s cock. There was something strange about it, but once again Mitch wrote it off to being a trick of the light. He wrapped his lips around it, and bobbed his head along the length, teasing the shaft and head with his tongue.<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s hand gripped Mitch&#39;s head, his fingers winding through that shaggy blond mop. Mitch felt something pricking at his scalp, like the gentle poke of claws, but it didn&#39;t hurt. Rather he felt encouraged to service Andy more. Pre leaked onto his tongue, salty and rich, with a deep musky flavor. It seemed to fill him with life, tingling on his tongue and filling him with energy. Andy had rolled his head back, eyes shut and enjoying Andy&#39;s mouth, so neither of them really noticed the hair starting to grow in on Mitch&#39;s chest and stomach. Formerly smooth, not even from shaving but from genetics, the blond hairs started growing in. Nor did they notice the brown hairs on Andy&#39;s chest spreading out, growing more wild and thick.<br />
<br />
Mitch kicked off his pants, gripping his own cock in one hand as he held onto Andy&#39;s with his other, still sucking on that shaft like it was the sweetest thing he ever tasted. Hair was growing thicker on Mitch&#39;s arms and legs as he took his mouth off of Andy&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s eyes shot open, they had gone from brown to a golden tone that seemed to shine inside the dim light of the tent. But Mitch found he wasn&#39;t afraid, only more eager to please. He straddled Andy&#39;s waist and lowered himself on to the slicked cock, slowly guiding it to his hole. He had never wanted someone inside of him as much as he did at that moment.<br />
<br />
Andy didn&#39;t know what to think, but instinct was taking over as he gripped Mitch&#39;s hips, bucking eagerly, helping the slightly younger man to ride his cock. It was tight and warm, so much tighter than any pussy he had ever fucked before, and he found he didn&#39;t need to be careful or gentle. Mitch seemed to like it a little rough as  he pounded away on that now slightly fuzzy ass.<br />
<br />
Muscles grew stronger in both of them, Mitch&#39;s already athletic form becoming cut and muscular. Andy on the other hand could pass as an amateur body builder with how much his chest and arms were swelling with new muscle. Andy&#39;s beard had grown in along his jaw and chin, though not his mustache. Mitch likewise now had stubble along his jaw, blond and sparse, but more than had been there moments ago.<br />
<br />
Gritting his teeth, Andy felt his climax coming. He wanted to roar at the top of his lungs, but something inside him told him that would be a bad idea in the crowded camp. Instead he pulled Mitch towards him and clamped his teeth around that muscular shoulder, hard enough to hold him but not hard enough to break skin. It might leave a bruise though. His seed flooded into the other man, even as he felt the hot streams from Mitch&#39;s cock splash across his furry pecs and abs.<br />
<br />
One he pulled himself off the cock, Mitch was only too happy to help clean Andy up, running his tongue along Andy&#39;s chest and stomach to clean up the mess. Then collapsing next to him and resting his head on his chest.<br />
<br />
Andy wrapped a heavy, muscular arm around Mitch, pulling him close and burying his nose in the other man&#39;s hair, smelling that wonderful, enticing scent. Eventually both drifted off.</p>
