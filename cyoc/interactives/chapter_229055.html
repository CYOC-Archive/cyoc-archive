<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt was pacing. He didn&#39;t know what was about to happen. Stress only mounted more as he waited for Chad to finally show up. When Chad knocked on Matt&#39;s door, he felt the guilt in his gut only seem to double over inside of him. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; he apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! Woah! Woah!&quot; Chad held his hands up. &quot;It&#39;s fine. I know Michael can be a bit aggressive, but it&#39;s alright. If you still need time that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll talk to him.&quot; However the confusion on Matt&#39;s face only made Chad start to worry. He knew Matt was a bit of a worrier, but it usually came with legitimate reasons as well. &quot;That&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t delete the photos did you?&quot; Chad jumped to the worst case scenario he could. Worry filled him as he thought all that time and money they&#39;d spent on the destination wedding, only to have it all gone made him terrified. More over Michael freaking out on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Matt said. &quot;It&#39;s not that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank God...&quot; Chad muttered. &quot;Then what? You look like you&#39;ve screwed something up? What could possibly be bothering you so much?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt tilted his head. &quot;Do you really not know?&quot; he asked as Chad stepped into his studio apartment. Chad shook his head. &quot;Michelle. She&#39;s a man now. You married a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad felt himself snort. &quot;I know I married a man. Michael,&quot; he corrected Matt. &quot;We&#39;ve been dating almost four years now. I met him freshman year of college.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of that was true. Him and Michelle had met at a party. They really hit it off. &quot;But you&#39;re straight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehh...&quot; Chad shrugged his broad shoulders. &quot;I guess. But Michael&#39;s different.&quot; He was looking wistfully into the distance clearly thinking about all the good times they&#39;d shared together. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I never thought I&#39;d be with a guy either, but when I&#39;m with Michael... It&#39;s all different. You know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s stare only lengthened. It had to be at least 1000 yards by now. &quot;NO! You&#39;re straight! This is your wife!&quot; he pulled up the original of the picture he&#39;d taken. It was the only one that still remained of Michelle.<br />
<br />
Chad leaned in to get a better look of the picture. &quot;She is pretty... But I don&#39;t know her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Matt was struggling. None of this made any sense. How could Chad be so calm about all this. &quot;No. Look. See...&quot; He stumbled over his words trying to grasp on some kind of concept that might be able to explain it. &#39;Just start from the beginning.&#39; Matt took a breath. &quot;Ok.&quot; He breathed again. &quot;I used this photo in a program. For some reason when I came back, it completely altered the photo to be what you think Michael is. This is your wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause before Chad started bellowing out in laughter. He couldn&#39;t hold it back. Tears started streaming out of his eyes as he listed everything off. &quot;Bro! You&#39;ve been reading too many comic books or some shit. I&#39;m married to Michael. We&#39;ve been dating for like four years now. You were at the wedding. Now you think some program changed him? Come on... Don&#39;t be ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. You want proof?&quot; Matt was getting agitated. He pushed Chad towards his bed. The former football player let himself fall onto it. Even if he was 6&#39;2&quot; and still had a decent amount of his muscle, he allowed Matt to push him down. It didn&#39;t matter that Matt was 6 inches shorter than him and weighed about half of him he fell back onto the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. I would like some proof,&quot; Chad smirked as he bounced on the bed. He watched as Matt wandered around and got his camera equipment.<br />
<br />
Matt setup the tripod with a camera on top. &quot;Smile,&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
Chad gave him a mocking smile as he stared at the camera. Matt took a picture. He went over to the computer and added it. Chad was right behind him. &quot;Create your heart&#39;s desire?&quot; he read the tagline of the program.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll show you it changes people,&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what&#39;s your heart&#39;s desire?&quot; Chad asked. There was almost a mocking tone as he read the phrase.<br />
<br />
Matt flinched. He knew exactly what his desire was. He&#39;d thought about that desire hundreds upon hundreds of times; a big sexy pro football player or powerlifter who loves to bottom for him. There was no way he could tell Chad that! &quot;Just give you a little more muscle,&quot; he lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I have been lacking, haven&#39;t I? Michael says he wants me to start hitting the weights again with him, but I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s way more advanced than me. Plus, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to get any further in football. I might as well just lean into the weight, you know?&quot; Chad grabbed at the luv handles he was starting to develop. They weren&#39;t huge, but when you keep your football diet without your football workout, you tend to gain a bit more weight. Since he was still in his mid twenties, that weight hadn&#39;t started to fully stack on yet. Though, that didn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t starting to.<br />
<br />
Matt nodded in agreement. He still thought Chad was pretty hot. It was just different. Instead of the young lean muscles that gave him a jock build, he was building a bit more of a burly physique. Muscle was clearly there so the bit of fat starting covering them made them look even bigger.<br />
<br />
Still, Matt had to prove it to Chad. He uploaded the picture to the program, then hit the create button.<br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wait...&quot; Matt answered. He pointed at the little green bar that was starting to fill up. As the timer started, Matt kept getting this niggling feeling in the back of his brain. It kept focusing on Chad. His body was always so big. It was a bit weird that they were even friends. Though, Matt&#39;s ability to take photos for him to show off on Instagram really helped make them get along better. It just helped that Matt was gay. He had enough references from other guys to make sure that Chad was always in his best poses.<br />
<br />
However, now that he had gone through with actually showing someone, he felt worried. At 25% completion, the first iteration of the photo came up. Matt swallowed hard. No longer was Chad wearing a shirt. It had come off at some point. Even in the blurry nature of the changing photo, he could see it. Yet, there was more. Chad always had trouble growing hair, except his chest and torso was completely covered in it. Same with his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?!&quot; Matt shouted as he pointed at the changing photo. As he looked back, Chad wasn&#39;t wearing a shirt. His beefy torso was on full display and covered in hair. He came over to look.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s different?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
Matt jumped up from his chair. &quot;You&#39;re changing!&quot; he declared. At 50% completion the image changed again. Matt stared as his football friend started to grow taller. At 6&#39;2&quot; Chad wasn&#39;t exactly a small man, but Matt could see another inch or two adding onto his height. Instead of his muscular body thinning out at the added height it only seemed to be getting bigger and beefier. Muscle and mass worked together to give him an absolute powerful frame. His wide shoulders and thick muscled belly bloated out as he&#39;d transformed more into a power lifter than a sports athlete.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am?&quot; Chad looked over himself. Even as he did thick brown hair was rapidly covering the back of his hands and running up his forearms. The inkling of hair against his chest and belly doubled into a thick forest of hair. The light beard that gently ran along the lines of his face turned into a huge nest that looked to have been growing out over the course of years. &quot;I don&#39;t feel any different...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are--Are you for real?&quot; Matt was starting to feel regret. Watching his friend change like this was nerve wracking. &quot;Then why aren&#39;t you wearing a shirt?!&quot; Matt tried to create some kind of reason as though it would make Chad see through the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you keep it so damn hot in here...&quot; Chad grumbled. Even without a shirt on, he was clearly starting to sweat. With that much mass on his body it was clear that he produced a lot of heat.<br />
<br />
Matt looked at his computer. 75% completion. &quot;We need to stop,&quot; he declared.<br />
<br />
Chad stopped him. &quot;What?&quot; there was a softness in his voice. Despite it dropping an octave, he sounded so calming. Chad wrapped his big burly body around Matt. His hand slid down Matt&#39;s arm and took control. It wasn&#39;t too forceful, but enough to let Matt know that he was in charge. &quot;You know, Michael&#39;s okay with it...&quot; he purred in Matt&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
Several seconds passed as Matt could barely even breathe. Everything around him slowed to a stop as he felt Chad&#39;s body around his. The soft tickling of the burly man&#39;s beard against his neck sent wonders through him, but it was the powerful nature behind the voice that made everything stop. Matt looked up to see the photo had shifted again.<br />
<br />
The picture of Chad no longer had him sitting on the bed, rather laying on it in nothing more than a jock strap. His hands rested softly on the powerful belly, looking seductively at the camera. Chad had grown again. He must have added another inch or two to his frame but a ton of weight. Even from just the photo it looked like his broad shoulders could barely fit through any doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on...&quot; Chad cooed. &quot;We all know why you invited me over...&quot; His grip tightened, then completely shifted. Without so much of an effort, he lifted Matt&#39;s body up into a bridal carry.<br />
<br />
Matt hadn&#39;t realized anything was different until he felt his body tossed onto the bed. He stared up at the massive man before him. Power and strength radiated off the man as he crawled himself on top of Matt. Chad leaned in for a kiss. Matt couldn&#39;t stop himself. His body was going to autopilot. Everything about this was to his hearts desires as he felt the mass of the other man on top of him. Their fingers intertwined as the kiss between them deepened.<br />
<br />
The mass of Chad&#39;s body controlled itself enough not to crush his current partner. He gently rubbed his whole body against Matt&#39;s writhing on top of it.<br />
<br />
In the other room the computer dinged. The photo was complete.<br />
<br />
Chad smiled as he shifted once again. He looked like a true massive powerlifted. He rose up slightly, only to lower himself down enough to take of Matt&#39;s pants. Despite all that size, he was surprisingly nimble. Chad&#39;s fingers easily removed the button and slid the jeans down his legs, then removed the underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s happy to see me...&quot; Chad mocked.<br />
<br />
Matt blushed as he couldn&#39;t control his dick. Just seeing the powerhouse bear on top of him and feeling his strength used so gently on him was too much. That didn&#39;t mean he expected what was next. In nothing but the jock strap, Chad positioned himself on top of Matt&#39;s dick. Before Matt could say anything he slid down on top of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMPH!&quot; Matt gasped as he felt his cock enveloped. Chad only took it as a compliment and continued using it as his own toy.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH YES!&quot; Chad&#39;s deep voice rumbled through the apartment. He was exaggerating it a bit, but was clearly still having fun. His big hands parsed through the thick forest of hair on his chest, gently massaging his burly pecs. Each grunt and groan was made out of exuberance as he continued to pleasure himself on Matt&#39;s tool.<br />
<br />
Matt was lost in all of it. His hands clawed at the bed beneath him as he bucked and writhed in confusion. All he knew was pleasure as he sat on the edge. It was impossible for any real thoughts to come through. That&#39;s when he felt himself finish. A deep satisfied grunt escaped him as he unloaded into the massive man on top of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH YES!&quot; Chad bellowed out again. He bit his bottom lip as he gripped his massive chest. A bit of cum leaked out of the jock he was wearing before he fell down next to Matt and gently cradled the smaller man. &quot;That was fun... Maybe we can invite Michael next time...&quot; The seductive nature of his voice gently spoke into Matt&#39;s ear. It turned into a series of nibbles and kisses as he felt his small little partner wriggle around.<br />
<br />
&quot;But--But you&#39;re married!?&quot; Matt declared. &quot;And straight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad shrugged again. &quot;Bi... Maybe.&quot; He smirked getting a bit devious. &quot;Never stopped us before. Besides, Michael said if you did a good job, you deserved a bonus.&quot; Matt&#39;s face went beet red as he tried his best to contain himself. Chad kissed him again before getting off the bed and going to the bathroom to clean up.<br />
<br />
It took a moment for Matt to come back down to earth. His mind was running wild as he wondered about Chad. He then turned to the computer to find the picture he had taken was of a huge burly man covered in brown hair, laying seductively on his bed in nothing but a jock strap. He scrolled back through the wedding photos to see this new Chad had replaced the old one. Even though Chad was 2 inches taller than Michael, he was still the one being held gently. &quot;Oh no...&quot; Matt uttered.</p>
