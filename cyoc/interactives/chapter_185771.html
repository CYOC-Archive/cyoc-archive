<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Holy shit! The bar!&quot; Matthew was woken by a man shouting.<br />
<br />
She turned to see her own naked body in bed beside her. It took a moment to recall the events of last night. That was her new friend Sabrina in that body - Her old body minus Matthew&#39;s pride and joy. Matthew was in Sabrina&#39;s goth girl body. She was naked. She recalled the experimentation she had got to with Sabrina last night. I had been an interesting night.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was meant to meet Megan at the bar at 12! It&#39;s already 12.30&quot; Matthew&#39;s old voice sounded panicky. &quot;If I don&#39;t meet Megan you don&#39;t get your dick back!&quot;<br />
<br />
The gravity of the situation finally dawned on Matthew. Sabrina need to get to the bar quickly &quot;Well don&#39;t just stand there! Get dressed and get going!&quot; she yelled in Sabrina&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Sabrina was already pulling on the clothes Matthew had given her last night. She got a good view of Sabrina&#39;s dickless crotch. There was no longer any need for modesty between the two of them. Matthew got out of bed herself. She too was naked in Sabrina&#39;s tattoo covered body.<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll come with you&quot; she told Sabrina<br />
<br />
&quot;No time. It takes hours to get that body ready. Have a shower and wish me luck&quot; Sabrina was buttoning up what had been Matthew&#39;s shirt. &quot;I&#39;ll be back as soon as I can. We will have to wait three hours between swaps anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What should I wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything you like as long as it is black&quot; Sabrina said with a grin as she was putting Matthew&#39;s shoes on. &quot;Okay I&#39;m off&quot; She grabbed her handbag putting it over very male looking shoulder and hurried out the door.<br />
<br />
Matthew, still naked, looked for the nightgown she had gone to bed in. She found it on the floor and put it on. The sexy silk nightgown felt good against her skin. It reminded Matthew of how good the her last days experience had been. Better even than she had anticipated. And to think this had happened without her having to spend a cent. With the money Megan had given them she would actually be in front financially.<br />
<br />
Sabrina was right. Matthew didn&#39;t need to be at the bar when Megan and Sabrina did their reverse swap. They would have to wait an additional three hours before she and Sabrina could swap back. Matthew wasn&#39;t sure whether or not she was looking forward to that.<br />
<br />
She found Sabrina&#39;s bathroom and emptied her bladder. That gave her another chance to examine the rose tattoo over Sabrina&#39;s vagina. She admired the way the artist had made the flaps around Sabrina&#39;s sex blend into the rose petals. Matthew had never been into tattoos previously but she did admire this one.<br />
<br />
Sabrina had suggested she have a shower so Matthew did so. She loved the way the water flowed over her body. Inadvertently she wet her hair so ended up using the shampoo she found in the shower cubical.<br />
<br />
She dried, threw the nightgown back on then went to find some clothes to wear. Opening Sabrina&#39;s wardrobe was interesting. Everything was black. Or at least predominantly black - some of the garments had patches of white or red. Even her underwear was black, some were very fancy but all were black.<br />
<br />
Sabrina had said &quot;Anything you like&quot; Matthew took that at her word. She took her time and selected the sexiest items she could find. She started with a lacy G-string then couldn&#39;t resist a fishnet body stocking. On top of that she put on a silky black corset. She tightened that as much as she dared, maximising her cleavage. She found a very very short leather miniskirt which barley covered her panties. The final piece was a faux leather, calf length, hybrid dress come trench coat. The lowest button on the coat was at her belly button and as Matthew strode her long legs, the short skirt and the bottom of her corset were revealed. Matthew loved the effect. <br />
<br />
She teemed that with some knee length boots, choosing some with the tallest narrowest heels, black of course. Matthew had never worn high heels before the platform boots of last night. She figured she had a few hours to practice walking in them. <br />
<br />
Satisfied with how she was dressed she went to Sabrina&#39;s kitchen and checked out what she might have for breakfast come lunch.<br />
<br />
She had half expected to find frozen spiders or bats in the fridge but was pleasantly surprised to find just normal everyday foods inside. She made herself a cheese sandwich and a cup of coffee.<br />
<br />
Matthew had just sat down with her coffee when her phone rang. She and Sabina had swapped numbers last night but still retained their own phones. It was Sabrina ringing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Sabrina&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Matthew?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad news. The girls had left before I got here. I wasn&#39;t able to get your dick back. I&#39;m on my way home&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easier to explain when I get there. Needless to say you have a problem. I&#39;ll be there soon&quot; she hung up</p>
