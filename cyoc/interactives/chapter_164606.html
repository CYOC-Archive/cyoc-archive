<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some time passes and you start to regain consciousness and you vaguely hear two voices talking. Your vision was blurred out of pure exhaustion and your head was pounding while your pelvic nethers felt sore and looking down to see the two enormous orbs in front of your face only reminded you why that was. Slowly your vision became clearer and you saw that you were laying in a rather nice looking bed that felt soft and cozy, and the room around you looked nice as well. At the foot of the bed you recognized two figures speaking with one another. On your right there was the chestnut brown stallion wearing a regal cape, with his equine member hanging flaccid between his legs. Across from him of course was the orange fluffy vixen, Janice, was who had her arms crossed and the two seemed to be talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, your majesty I understand I am your property as well as my friend, and I mean no offense towards you when I say this, but you could’ve well... taken it easy on her a little couldn’t you?&quot; Janice whimpered,&quot;You and... my former master use similar methods in making girls, and I meant no discrimination against culture on the way here. Do you understand what I mean? I sincerely and humbly apologize for almost making a scene, but I urge you to take things more gentler with her until she’s at least comfortable in her body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm....&quot; The horse prince paused and watched as Janice bowed to him and nodded,&quot;I understand your concern, and I can respect that. If you promise to learn our culture and continue to assist her as I am told you will then I see no reason for ill will towards you. Perhaps I’ll even let you join her after she’s comfortable, and possibly make you more than our personal maid and her assistant. I accept your apology, Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then groaned a bit and slowly sat up, shaking your head a bit and both Janice and the prince turned towards you and approached your bed on both sides. &quot;Tommy, are you okay? How do you feel? Anything uh..... hurt?&quot; Janice’s asked blushing slightly as her ears fell to the sides of her head, glancing briefly at the prince, who seemed to look you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uugh my head is pounding, and my....&quot; You blushed slightly wanting to bite your tongue,&quot;P-Pussy..... is sore....&quot;<br />
<br />
The prince slowly nodded and he sighed,&quot;I see... my apologies for that, it’s just our culture here. If one is certain the one they meet is destined to be their mate, then they should be claimed as soon as possible, even publicly like you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah.....&quot; Janice added and blushed a bit,&quot;Your uh.... I really don’t want to say Master... buuut..... well... he explained everything to me, and I’ll let him explain things to you now. Should I give you two some space for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at Janice, noticing she was wearing clothing made out of leather, and it was much more covering than her previous getup, plus her collar was gone. Considering everything that has just happened to you, you looked down at your hands and breasts and said,&quot;I-I’d... rather have comfort.... f-from someone who I at least half-know, at least.... Janice... if you’re still the you I know that is,&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice slowly nodded, and she sat down next to you on the bed and smiled,&quot;You look beautiful, though... I haven’t been equine at all so I don’t know how good of a judge I am. But hey, as far as women go... I’ve been like this for a lot longer than you so...&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded then hugged Janice close, and you noticed the horse prince watch this, his expression just studying the scene a bit as you let your emotions take a firm hold of you. You started to cry a little before you watched the prince reach out and stroke your hair, or mane in this case, he was gentle when doing so and it felt nice to have him doing so, even though he was basically a complete stranger. The prince sat at your feet and leaned in, and as he did you released Janice as the prince reached out and placed his hand on the size of your muzzle. He began stroking your muzzle, making his way up to your cheek as he smiled slightly, his eyes looking into yours as yours stared back into his. <br />
<br />
&quot;By my standards, you are a perfect mare,&quot; The prince said then kissed you on the nose and added,&quot;I am Prince Erick, of Halenhoof, and I hope I didn’t come off as cruel or disturbing when we first met,&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed slightly seeing his bare chest, his equine cock and balls, as well as his finely built muscular figure. Briefly you wondered if you actually found him attractive, and every instinct and hormone in your body seemed to agree that you did. He soon laid down next to you on top of the blankets as Janice sat on a chair next to the bed, and exclaimed,&quot;Tommy is your name huh? We’ll need to change that to something more fitting, but for now let’s just focus on you since we will likely have multiple matters to deal with before long. But first, as to why I bidded on you....&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick then cleared his throat,&quot;In our culture, we live in a monarchy, much like that lust filled fox Karther, however as you may imagine things are rather different here than when dealing with kitsunes, no offense to our two tailed friend here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I uh... never really stayed with the kitsunes much.... all I really managed to do was meet the prince, see my friend was turned into a harem vixen, and then wake up in an auction in chains. You know the rest of the story,&quot; You sighed blushing as he stroked your muzzle some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it’ll be easier to teach you about our ways,&quot; Erick smiled patting you on the shoulder,&quot;You’ll he happy to know while we are most certainly polygamous here, we generally limit ourselves to two or three wives maximum. Any more than that and... well it gets rather difficult to display affection to each of them. Back to as I was saying before, as you already know I have been looking for a mate, someone to carry my legacy, and you my dear mare are that very person.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed recalling what happened between you and Erick,&quot;I-I c-can see that considering.... well....&quot; You bit your lip and Erick nodded before pulling you into a caring hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more, I can recall, and I make sure your breeding from now on will be much more... how do you say.... controlled, considerate, and passionate. For the time being I want you to remain here in your room, and I will have Janice cater to your every whim, as well as help you adjust yourself to this new form by any means necessary. I have even allowed the two of you to participate in intimacy, since here any affairs with someone of the same sex doesn’t affect the relationship between mates of the opposite sex. I want you to see this palace as your home, me as your future betrothed, and you can view Janice as whatever you deem fit. Again, I apologize for the incident yesterday, breeding season is fresh in the minds of all of us and I was quite.... pent up you could say.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly nodded in response to Erick then felt his large cloven hand cup one of your breasts and gently squeeze and massage it slowly. The sensitivity and sensation this gave you made you moan softly and blush heavily, but it felt nice and arousing to have someone else toy with your sensitive flesh. Erick then smiled and asked,&quot;Is this too much for now my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your cheeks turned even brighter and redder than before as he said this and you shook your head,&quot;J-Just s-s-so.... s-sensitive....&quot; <br />
<br />
Erick nodded then stopped and kissed your cheek,&quot;I’ll let you recover a bit then, treat today as a day to relax, and ask anything of me or Janice, but by then end we should probably figure out a new name for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded in agreement with this,&quot;Y-Yeah.... I’ll think of something, or try, honestly it’s kind of... intimidating when everything and everyone is bigger than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick chuckled,&quot;Worry not dear vixen, you are one of us as long as you treat my love well, and help her as much as you can. Now,&quot; Erick stood up,&quot;unfortunately I have some duties to attend to, and won’t be available until this evening. So for now I leave guards at your doorstep and you in the care of Janice, simply send for me is you need anything my dear. But for now,&quot; Erick leaned in and kissed you on the cheek,&quot;welcome home~&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Janice then watched Erick leave the room and close the door behind him, and after he left you felt comfortable enough to pull down the covers and pull yourself upright into a seated position on the side of your bed. You gently allowed your hooves to fall onto the ground, each making a light clop as they did. You couldn’t feel the floor, and didn’t have any heels, which was definitely going to be a struggle. Looking up you saw a mirror on the wall reflecting your whole body in it, and you saw everything that you were now for the first time and covered your mouth, blushing.<br />
<br />
You looked like a goddamn Amazon compared to Janice, and sure proportionally everything on you was equal to her, except if you were the same size your ass maybe would look somewhat larger due to your equine body structure, but because of your general size everything on your body was naturally just bigger. Janice seemed to notice your expression and walked over, sitting next to you, and she was about eye level with your upper chest. <br />
<br />
Without saying a word the cute vixen hugged you tightly and in response you returned the hug, but were careful not to hug her hard enough to break anything in her body as tears welled up in your eyes. &quot;I know how you feel, and we’ll get through this together,&quot; Janice whispered to you, nuzzling your chin, but also squishing her body against your breasts in order to do so,&quot;It’s awkward as fuck, I know, but at least it’s with me and not some other girl who knows nothing about your or what we went through,&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly nodded and sniffled a bit,&quot;Y-Yeah.... thanks.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded and you pulled her onto your lap where she could at least look at you more on a face to face level, and she ran her hands down along your body from your arms down to your ass and wide flank,&quot;You’d give me a run for my money if you ended up like this back with Karther, but forget about him, what would you like to do first since I’m technically your servant?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wiping your tears you paused and looked down at your body, as you held Janice close to you, and you thought for a moment then said,&quot;W-Well...&quot;</p>
