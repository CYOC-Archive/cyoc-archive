<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve thought about and have just the solution&#39; your apparent mother said. &#39;Now I need to get Graeme his glass of water. He might just get a bit of something else with it&#39; <br />
<br />
You watched as your girlfriend fetched a glass of cold water. Then observed as she took a pill from her handbag and dissolved it in the glass. &#39;Maybe you should give your mother a ring and tell her Graeme has arrived home. I should be done in about 20 minutes&#39; She then gave you a smile as she returned to your parents bedroom, shutting the door behind her, but not before you heard your stepfather say &#39;Get back here you sexpot. I&#39;m ready for round three&#39;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to listen to the sounds coming from the room you went out to the front yard before ringing your mother. She had evidently just arrived at the watch house but had not yet entered. She sounded annoyed when you told her that Graeme had just arrived home.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well tell him I&#39;ll be about 30 minutes. He should have rung me&#39;<br />
<br />
You went back inside but only for a minute. You were used to your mother and Graeme being nosy when they had sex but this was different. Even though the woman moaning sounded like your mom you knew it was really your girlfriend. When she started calling out &#39;Yes! Yes!&#39; that was enough for you and you went back out to the front garden.<br />
<br />
Monica was pretty much spot on when she had estimated that she would be about 20 minutes. She must have spotted you out the front and from a partially opened door called you inside.<br />
<br />
You entered to still find her in your mother&#39;s body. She told you triumphantly &#39;Graeme is exhausted. He&#39;ll sleep for a couple of hours at least&#39;<br />
<br />
Sarcastically you said &#39;What was that? More Kama Sutra positions?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No. He just wanted to do it doggy style. They only do one new position each day&#39;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know how to reply to that.  After a few seconds of awkward silence you asked &#39;So how are you going to fix this problem? I suspect you have just made it worse&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;ll see. Did you ring her?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes. She will be back in about 10 minutes&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s good. We have time for a quickie. I gather you are a bit jealous. I think I need to show you that you are still my favorite son&#39; with that she got down on her knees and undid your fly. Soon she was sucking your member. As annoyed as you were at her behavior you could not help but become erect. A minute later you were pounding that member into her sodden vagina as she lay on the loungeroom floor.<br />
<br />
You had forgotten the time and momentarily panicked when you heard a car pull up outside &#39;Shit! It&#39;s mom back. Quickly hide&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t worry about me. Your the one who needs to get dressed and answer the door. Just remember to do as I say&#39; she ran down the hallway.<br />
<br />
You had pulled up your trousers and were putting your tee-shirt on when Mom opened the door. &#39;Hi Mom&#39; sorry about before. I must have misinterpreted the phone message&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Not your fault. But I must say I have had better days. Where is he?&#39;<br />
<br />
A male voice came from down the hallway. &#39;Hi Susie, I&#39;m so sorry. It&#39;s been one mix up after another. But it&#39;s great to see you again&#39; It was Graeme. You were puzzled. Monica had just told you he would be sleeping for a few hours. You watched as Graeme gave you Mom a tight cuddle. &#39;Thanks for arranging my release&#39; You noticed Graeme was squeezing your Mom&#39;s bum, exactly as he had squeezed your girlfriends an hour or so earlier.<br />
<br />
Your mother gave a bit a a shriek &#39;Graeme! Not here. Not in front of Simon&#39; she didn&#39;t sound too upset<br />
<br />
Graeme then gave you a smile and a wink and said &#39;Hmmph! We&#39;ll have to do something about that. Simon! Take a hike! Go see that girlfriend of yours! If I have to have my honeymoon at home. I don&#39;t want my stepson hanging around!&#39;<br />
<br />
It was only then that you realized Monica had shapeshifted once more. She was now in the body of your stepfather. You watched as you had a replay of earlier events. &quot;Graeme&quot; lifted up your Mum and carried her down the hall. The only difference was that they went into the spare bedroom rather than the master bedroom where you assumed the real Graeme was sleeping.<br />
<br />
Hearing your Mom ask &#39;Are we going to try out this Tigrex?&#39; as the door shut was enough to make you head out to the front garden once more.<br />
<br />
It was another 30 minutes before your girlfriend, still in a copy of Graeme&#39;s body knocked on the window and beckoned you back inside.<br />
<br />
&#39;I need your help to carry your mom back to her own bed. We need to be careful so she doesn&#39;t stir&#39; She carried your mothers naked but sleeping body. Your job was to open the doors and remove the clothes strewn on the floor so &quot;Graeme&quot; wouldn&#39;t trip. Your watched as your Mom was deposited beside the naked slumbering true Graeme.<br />
<br />
It was only once you were back in the lounge that you were finally able to breathe. You told your shapeshifted girlfriend. &#39;Let&#39;s get out of here. Let&#39;s go to your place. But first can you please put some clothes on and preferably get out of that body&#39;</p>
