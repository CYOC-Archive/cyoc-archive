<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been silent and peaceful for about a month now, only smaller incidents that hadn앖 needed Tommy to change someone.<br />
But then they got four new students to the school that were recently kicked from their old school for violence to others. First there were the twins Brian and Dave, both beating up everyone who got in their way or even said something bad about them. Having fun if their target twitchs in pain or even were pissing themselves out of fear of the two. The other two were also twins, Gwen and  Jen. They were similar to them when it come to violence and brutality. It seemed that Brian and Jen were a pair and Gwen and Dave were also.<br />
The four gained a friend in a boy named Zach who also liked to beat up others. He hadn앖 beat up anyone at school but outside of it.<br />
Even the school was powerless against them. Every punishment to them resulted in more violence against others. <br />
<br />
Two weeks after them coming to this school and Tommy had been beaten up three times for just being in the way was enough for him to think about the Chronivac again. He just needed to decide what to do with them. <br />
<br />
The next morning Tommy got them to chase him,  having increased his speed so he could make it to an area where they would be alone for the changes. He had preprogrammed the freeze of their bodies, so when he reached the empty area he turned and hit enter. All five of them freeze up on the spot, cursing Tommy for whatever he had done to them while Tommy as typing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have so much fun in beat up others and seeing someone piss or shit himself. You look down on others do what you want them to do. So I know what to do to you to make you realize what it feels like.&quot; With that, he hit enter for the changing commands.<br />
Brian beginns to shrink down. Only after a couple of seconds he took notice that he wasn앖 only shrinking but also regressing in age. All the way back to a small newborn baby with his mind still intact. His clothes had shrunken with him while changing from boxers to a diaper and from black shirt, blue shorts and socks to an bright pink onesie, only adding to the insult. His black shoes remained mostly the same as before, only smaller to fit on his new body and turning white.<br />
Dave압 body didn앖 change on the outside, only his clothes did. Like his brothers, his boxers changed into a diaper. His dark blue shorts just vanish, while his light green shirt shortened in length, only reaching down to his navel. His black socks turned white while his brown shoes turned green. Around his hands appear light green mittens that would stop him from grabbing things. His mind was suppressed by  a new developed mind, that of a newborn baby. All the strength of his body vanished, letting the baby-minded body drop down to the ground.<br />
Gwen changed another way. First, all her clothing vanished. Slowly her arms melt into her sides while her legs fused with each other. Her whole body then turned more and more cylindrical, her skin changes to a black leather with seams. Her hair turned into some kind of chain and it looked like her body was floating above the ground hold up by the chains. She had turned into a punching bag. <br />
Jen압 clothes also vanished. Then all over her body grows small brown hairs, looking like a furcoat. Her hands and feet slowly deform into paws. A tail sprouts from her rear and with some cracks her body bend to go down on all fours. Her arms and legs shrink to the same length before her whole body shrinks down. Lastly her face streched into a snout and her ears change form. Jen is now a dog. Like Dave her mind was suppressed by a new one, that of a dog.<br />
Zach압 changes were little. His body would be the one to watch over the others. He gained a little muscle so he can carry Dave압 baby-minded body around. His clothes changed into more useful clothes with many pockets for looking after two babys and a dog. Like Dave and Jen, his mind was suppressed by the new, caring, helpful young man.<br />
<br />
With the changes happend, Tommy explains to the five. &quot;Zach압 body is the one who watches and cares for the others. Brian압 body is that of a newborn baby with the body in control while Dave압 body is a teenager with the mind of a baby. Jen압 body is the one of the families dog. Gwen압 body is a punching bag that will be transported to a fitnesscenter were she will be used much. The diapers and clothes of the babys and the caretaker will be self-cleaning, meaning the don앖 need to be changed. All of your bodies will not age in mind or body, meaning you will keep this situation forever. Every now and then, your normal minds while rotate between the bodies, so you will see all the five perspectives. You can앖 do anything against the bodies and minds you are in, meaning you are totally helpless to change your fate. You will have time were you five can comunicate with each other and time when you will be all alone.&quot;<br />
With all explained, Tommy let them all be transported to their new lifes. The punching bag in the new fitnesscenter downtown and the family of three and a dog in a small house near it. They family would not have any problems with money, but that was little comfort for their screaming minds.</p>
