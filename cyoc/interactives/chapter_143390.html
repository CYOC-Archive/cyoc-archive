<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing that changed was that the darkened tent quickly took on a different light. Shapes became clearer, shadows lost their depth. The world took on a pale green tint that was ever so slightly misty around the edges. It was like a dream world, beautiful to behold. Though Zach did not know it, his eyes marked his first physical change. They were now larger, amber-hued with gold flecks and pupils that were neither wholly round nore wholly slitted, but a blend of hominid and felid. They drank the dim light and gave him night vision on par with a prowling cat&#39;s.<br />
<br />
An itchiness started to claw across Zach&#39;s body. It quickly became unbearable, forcing him to rip off his shirt, and then his stained boxers, leaving him completely nude. He started to scratch himself, but paused when he felt a strange sensation under his fingertips. Bewildered, he glanced down at his exposed flesh.<br />
<br />
Fur was growing across his torso. Soft, milky white down barely a centimeter in length that started at his navel and quickly spread out from there. As it reached his sides, the colour darkened to a tawny gold. Black rosettes started to appear, hundreds of them scattered throughout the golden fur. His chest became completely covered in soft white fur with the exception of his nipples. The spotted golden fur continued across his body, down his legs, up his arms, across his back. Zach felt gentle impacts on his shoulders and across his back while dark blotches fell across his face. He ran his hand across his head and realized with a start that all his hear had fallen out! Not just his scalp, but his eyebrows as well. There came an unbearable ticklish sensation as the fur spread scross his sensitive scalp and face. <br />
<br />
By the time the fur stopped growing, all that was left bare were his palms, soles, lips, nostrils and his penis. Zach scrambled to locate the small mirror he kept for shaving. He found it and took an anxious gaze at his own reflection. His eyes startled him the most, but so did the rest of him. The rosettes grew smaller across his head and tapered off across his forehead and cheeks, leaving the rest of his face a bare tawny hue. He found his new appearance astounding, but also mesmerizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look like a leopard,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;I. . . . a leopard.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sudden wave of heat swept over Zach, causing him to drop the mirror with a gasp. The heat pulsed before concentrating in his loins and nipples. He gave his nipples a tweak and marveled at how sensitive they had become. His member sprang to attention as Zach found himself more aroused than he had ever been in his life. He fell back on his cot, playing with his nipples and moaning softly.<br />
<br />
His muscles began to melt away, his physique slimming and losing its masculinity. But he was not becoming weak. What he lost in volume, he gained in density and tensile strength. His deceptively thin limbs now carried more strength than any human could imagine. That feeling of vigor added to Zach&#39;s ecstasy. He felt GOOD.<br />
<br />
His reverie was interrupted by sharp pain as his bones cracked and popped and started to reshape. But there was pleasure in the pain, pleasure that only spurred him on. His moans increased as his shoulders and ribs caved in, his hips flared out and his feet crackled and stretched out into a digitigrade stance.<br />
<br />
Zach was lost in his pleasure. He felt a wild cat&#39;s strength and virility. In his mind, he prowled the dark jungle, his spots letting him blend perfectly into the shadows. He stalked his prize: another leopard. She knew he was there. She was an intelligent, beautiful creature whose body ached in oestrus. She wanted him, and he wanted her. With a lunge, he landed across her back. His jaws clamped across her scruff in a powerful love bite. She yowled as his barbed shaft entered her. There was no foreplay, no tenderness, no romance. They were animals in rut, and Zach loved every second of it.<br />
<br />
Back in the tent, his thighs and ass started to swell with fat and muscle, pushing his lower back up off the cot. The new flesh rubbed against the base of his shaft, spurring him on further. His breath rushed out as his spine snapped into a sexy S-shape, further lifting him up off the cot. Dense muscle and shapely fat combined to form an ass and thighs that were magnificent, flawless and so very sexy. On his feet, his soles reshaped into pads and his toes cracked and migrated into paws. On both hands and both feet, Zach&#39;s nails painlessly fell out and in their place grew razor sharp retractable claws.<br />
<br />
In his fantasies, the roles began to change. The sensations in his nipples sharply increased, eliciting another moan. Intense pinpricks of pleasure bloomed across his softened abs as another pair of nipples appeared beneath the fur between his pecs and navel, and a third pair just below his navel. The original pair increased in size and pointed out, increasing the surface area for him to play with. Fatty tissue began to build underneath them, raising them up atop two budding mounds of flesh. They grew until they were a modest but perfect B-cup. Zach was becoming a hunter, and hunters did not need excess weight slowing them down and making them top-heavy. The other nipples stayed hidden beneath her fur, vestigial yet good erogenous zones.<br />
<br />
Zach&#39;s fantasies changed as his larynx caved in, giving him a seductive hiss instead of a masculine growl. In his fantasties, he was no longer the savage male pumping away. Zach was the lithe female, yowling and kneading the soil as she was entered. She felt powerful, matronly. The males were oafish in their singleminded drive to mate and drive out the competition. But the females were the true power in the jungle. They hunted, they observed, they learned, they taught the cubs. They had a mind for things beyond mating,  most of the time. But not now. Now, she was one with the male. He would give her his seed and she would train the next generation of the jungle&#39;s apex predators. The lion was comraderie and the tiger was brutality. But leopards were the paragon feline. And the female was the paragon leopard.<br />
<br />
Zach&#39;s testicles retreated into his body and began a transformation of their own. His ears flattened and shifted to the top of his head.  Zach gave an involuntary sneer as his face began to restructure into that of a powerful leopard. His fangs grew into vicious weapons as his muzzle extended into a compact killing tool. Whiskers extended around his reshaping nose. Atop his skull grew a short saggitarial crest where anchored his new, powerful jaw muscles. His face grew angular and feline, but also strangely feminine. He could see in the dark, hear and smell the world like never before.<br />
<br />
At last, Zach&#39;s aching cock couldn&#39;t bear to be ignored any longer. His feminine hands wrapped around the engorged shaft and began to pump. As he ministered to it, his penis began to shrink from man-sized to feline-sized, where it developed a point and grew barbs as it darkened to cherry red. A rumbling filled Zach&#39;s chest, a very deep purr. Something opened up under his cock. Something warm and wet and infinitely inviting. One hand slid down while the other continued to massage his cock. The hand probed the new depths until the fingers passed over a particular spot that caused all the fur on Zach&#39;s body to stsnd in sheer pleasure. Cock in one hand and cunt in the other, Zach went wild with pleasure.<br />
<br />
His cock began to shrink further, losing its defined features and becoming an indistinct nub of flesh an inch long. It was as if all the nerves scattered along the length of his dick were now concentrated into a much smaller surface area. It was mind-blowing and he rubbed the little nub all the faster until the last vestige of his cock had shrunk away, nestling atop the new vagina as its new clit.<br />
<br />
A pressure began to build in Zach&#39;s hips. One in the front, deep within his virgin pussy, and one in the back, just above his perfect ass. As they did, a third pressure started to build in his skull. The pressure began to build and build and build, like the magma churning beneath a volcano. An eruption was inevitable.<br />
<br />
The cats in Zach&#39;s mind tensed. And they climaxed, and he with them.<br />
<br />
It was unlike anything Zach could imagine. It was beyond anything a human was capable of experiencing. Every muscle tensed, every hair stood, every nerve fired. A roar exploded from deep within Zach&#39;s chest, all the way from his diaphragm. It went clean through the flimsy tent walls and echoed into the jungle. Not a man&#39;s yell or a woman&#39;s scream, but a panther broadcasting into its jungle demesne. Zach&#39;s tailbone stretched out, winding out from under Zach&#39;s writhing form into a beautiful, dappled tail.<br />
<br />
Then Zach&#39;s cranium caved in, flattening out his skull and his brain with it. The impact stunned him, causing him to flop back into the cot. The amulet slipped from his neck.<br />
<br />
It had done its work. Zach&#39;s transformation was complete. There was nothing left of the human Zach used to be, nor even the male he used to be. Not in appearance, nor mind, nor soul. <br />
<br />
She was now a leopard-woman. Her brain had been crushed and rearranged. She was as intelligent as a human, but with the simplistic nature of a leopard. Taboos like nudity and sex no longer concerned her. Memories of her human life hovered just beyond her reach, like a dream forgotten the moment one awakes. She didn&#39;t remember Zach&#39;s family, his friends, his first kiss or his school majors. She didn&#39;t even remember Zach&#39;s name. She had no need of one.<br />
<br />
The huntress basked in the afterglow of her masturbation. A rumbling purr filled her chest. She was content, and as an acolyte of Hacjuel, god of cats, personal contentment was all that she asked for.<br />
<br />
The sound of zippers opening snapped her out of her reverie. She heard human voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that a jaguar?&quot; Said one.<br />
&quot;I was sure it sounded like a leopard,&quot; said the other. Two more voices chattered in a different human language.<br />
<br />
Humans. Jungle burners and pelt-stealers. The leopard-woman&#39;s ears flattened in anger. Now that she had orgasmed, he was feeling a bit peckish. She stood and used a claw to gash a hole in the back of the tent. Before she slipped through, however, she picked up the amulet of Hacjuel and slipped it over her neck. She immediately felt her god&#39;s voice in her head. Influencing her to do his bidding.</p>

What does Hacjuel bid the leopard-woman to do?</h3>
