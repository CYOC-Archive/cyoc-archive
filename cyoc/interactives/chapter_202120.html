<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh! Family picture!&quot; Emily yelled.<br />
<br />
Becca and Ollie moaned. Becca never liked visiting, she was always treated like a kid. Ollie groaned because he hated how long his mom always took to take these. Emily aimed it like a selfie with each in frame and told everyone to say cheese.<br />
<br />
[FLASH]<br />
<br />
Emily’s thin frame shivered as her body inflated, her weak delicate arms engorged on themselves as biceps formed from long hours of the gym meticulously etched themselves, blood and flesh building on top of each other. Her bountiful breasts receded as the MILF’s thick ass pushed inwards, firming up as fat was quickly replaced with muscle. <br />
<br />
Testosterone flooded her system as her wet slick had erupted into a handsome package, two grapefruit like balls grew as her entrance closed, back broadening to match the new bowling ball sized deltoids that had erupted from her cheap T shirt. Across from the bulking woman, Paul’s rugged physique withered as it was replaced by a more petite framework. <br />
<br />
Powerful biceps had given way to thinner, unnoticeable arms as the once swollen masses were deflated. His prodigious chest slumped forward as the pectorals blossomed into bouncing breasts, fat replacing the once fit man. His glutes stuck out further and further as they lost their shape, his legs loosening and gaining cellulite.<br />
<br />
Elias’ muscular body grew thicker as body hair decorated his heaving chest, the once supple breasts forming the basis of the now swelling upper ridges of his neck. A bulbous shape emerged from his throat as Paul’s had vanished, Paul’s arm and leg hair disappearing into his body just as his broad shoulders crashed into themselves and compacting.<br />
<br />
Paul’s stubble was quickly erased as his jaw reshaped, cracking and forming into a softer angle as he lost his intimidating scowl for a more gentle pout, eyeshadow and makeup applying themselves onto him just as his buzzed cut grew outwards into blonde locks that flowed down his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Paul’s cock similarly shrunk, once erect but quickly compacting as it receded into himself as a new entrance greedily sucked in the useless organ, reformatting into her children’s place of origin. Her waist widening to accommodate her now feminized appearance as Eli’s thinned out into a taper, his body repurposing estrogen into the masculine counterpart fitting the bill of a patriarch. Eli sprouted upward as Pauline dwindled, reaching beyond 6 feet while she a meek 5. <br />
<br />
Pauline’s work shirt had been so large, it nearly draped across her body as a blanket, though, it quickly resized and shifted, the fabric becoming more silken as the sleeves dissipated and covered her whole body as a summer dress appeared decorating her.<br />
<br />
Eli’s once adorable chubby cheeks receded as his new purpose of being required a dehydrated face, jawline pushing outward as his eyebrows thickened brutishly. His once mild expression toughened up as facial hair carpeted his face, and peppering his now lantern jowls. What were longer brown strands of hair retreated into his scalp as he quickly gained a short haircut, perfectly framing his masculinity as his legs were covered in rough follicles. <br />
<br />
His cheap shirt had reformatted into a black tank top that did not do very well in hiding the musculature, as fabric wove themselves around his girthy physique and became a new white dress top befitting a businessman, his mom jeans having thinned and instead turn inky black as they rolled down his muscular legs as new clean slacks. His delicate feet had erupted the Sketchers for good reason, the plastic shoes becoming tougher Italian leather as thin strips hinged his socks.<br />
<br />
Oliver meanwhile went through a slight change as his chest gained fat and gained a pout akin to Pauline, his developing package receded and replaced with a newer, vastly different entrance, his frame shrinking slightly as his hair lengthened down his neck. Her larger orange hoodie did not change, save for a tint that went from reddish orange to a more yellow, and sweatpants had tightened slightly to accommodate the new joggers.<br />
<br />
Becca in kind bulked up as her large breasts had shrunk, with big being in, but femme being out. Her body similarly bulked up as her face roughened up, hair thinning out to resemble Eli as her father… With an impressive treasure that would easily remind others to whom his legacy belonged to. His plunging neckline dress had also shifted, cutting in half as the upper twin’s material eroded into a basic black cotton tank top like his father’s. The lower half had become an athletic shorts to deceptively hide the developing jewels bestowed upon him by Elias.<br />
<br />
In the span of seconds, the family had swapped genders and lives without any of them the wiser. Even the greasy food that was their dinner had been replaced with a thanksgiving like feast to render Elias’ and Brad’s larger appetites as plates of rotisserie chicken and salad appeared over the original pizza slices.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
“Jeez, mom, couldn’t you have warned us?” Brad groaned, blinking to get the light out of his eyes.<br />
<br />
Pauline giggled, as she too wiped her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Brad Sweetie, when you get to a certain age, family memories like this will last a lifetime. Your father and I won’t always be like this forever,” She paused to look over to Elias, who was busy scarfing down food, and had slowly cleared his throat and ate more civilized.<br />
<br />
“And besides, it was just yesterday you were my little boy…” She finished, unaware that her little boy was not even meant to be related to her.<br />
<br />
Brad rolled his eyes, as Olive shook her head, playing on her switch. In contrast to her older brother who voiced his soured opinions, Olive understand certain things were just something to keep quiet about and hopefully they’ll blow over. This was simply one of those times.<br />
<br />
Eli coughed, unbuttoning his top button and rolling his sleeves as they partook in the food.<br />
<br />
“Now kids,” Eli said, deep voice resonating in the house and Pauline’s ears.<br />
<br />
“Your mother and I both agree that family memory is something that she holds very dearly… Even if I don’t like it either.” Eli chuckled, Pauline beamed despite this and proceeded to stroke his meaty leg with hers under the dinner table, eliciting another brash cough.<br />
<br />
“I think we should appreciate what your mother is doing, you never know when you’d like to see these kinds of memories with <I>your</I> kids. Right Honey?” Eli spoke up, feeling his member thicken with excitement to his wife’s ministrations.<br />
<br />
Olive gagged as Brad rolled his eyes once again.<br />
<br />
“I dunno why I even bother.” Brad replied, before sticking a fork into his meal.<br />
<br />
_______<br />
<br />
Pauline hummed as she continued to do the dishes, thinking to how wonderful it was having her family eat dinner after a long time. Oddly, she could not recount such a family dinner happening like this, as if…<br />
<br />
Suddenly a hand clapped on her derriere and caused her to gasp.<br />
<br />
“Hi,” Eli spoke into her ear, voice dripping with desire.<br />
<br />
“Oh you,” Pauline stiffened as Eli applied pressure in his grasp, he melted into her as he held her waist in his arms.<br />
<br />
“Nice save today, right?” Eli continued.<br />
<br />
Pauline let out an indecent moan before quickly trying to wiggle her way to do the dishes.<br />
<br />
“Couldn’t help but notice the way you were enjoying me laying down the law.” Eli mumbled, leaning in and kissing her neck as Pauline struggled to lift the plate into the shelf.<br />
<br />
_______<br />
<br />
Olive sat in her room, decorated with all kinds of plushies and merchandise from her favorite things such as boy bands, rainbows, even Pokémon and Hello Kitty. She was in the zone, easily beating the newest temple puzzle of Breath of the Wild and had her headphones plugged in.<br />
<br />
She threw her legs up and got out of bed as she realized she needed to get her charger she left within the restroom. Without even looking up, Olive had opened her door and began to (slowly) trudge to the restroom as her Switch warned her of the low battery.<br />
<br />
_______<br />
<br />
Opposite to Olive’s room was Brad, who was curling his weights in his room before dropping them with a loud clank. He raised his tank top and held his phone camera up to take a quick picture of himself to post on Instagram to the adoration of many girls in his school. Despite the sloppy picture, he was assured to be a knockout. He was getting ready to make a tiktok of his physique doing a dance before a notification appeared on his phone.<br />
<br />
“Wat u doin bruh” - His best friend Craig wrote<br />
<br />
Brad typed away lazily.<br />
<br />
“Working out, bout to post a tiktok. U?”<br />
<br />
“Bout to crash Ashely A’s party tonite, u comin? Don’t be pussy cause ur dad said no bro. He on that roid shit.” - Craig<br />
<br />
“Nahhh, last time I went out he freaked. And he&#39;s not on roids he just likes the gym, so do I numb nuts”<br />
<br />
“Ahahaha u scared of a roid freak bro??? Cum on I no u no that there’s a bunch of hawt girls and guys there to bang.” - Craig.<br />
<br />
Brad mulled it over, he didn’t tell anyone, but being Bi was something new to him, his dad was a big name in the gym scene and he wasn&#39;t sure how he&#39;d react. Sure Brad liked girls but like, everyone was a lil gay and there was nothing wrong about wanting that cute femboy in class to—<br />
<br />
“Cum onnnn ill spam ur phone if you don’t answerrr am outsideee” - Craig replied, much to his displeasure.<br />
<br />
Brad looked around, he could jump out the front window and quietly hop down the roof fixture, but he’d need to be careful and make sure no one saw him or wanted to check in on him.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The camera, in all its reality altering glory had rendered the 4 new housemates different roles and lives, but as the camera is won’t to stay in one place, it had quickly found a short rest somewhere within the house unawares to the changed individuals.<br />
<br />
But where would the camera be, and what would happen in the wake of its chaotic nature once again?</p>
