<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You both go and take showers to clean some of the mutual cum off and there is plenty of heavy petting and another round of orgasms. Coming out of the shower was when it got very interesting. <br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe that your makeup stays in place and doesn&#39;t have to be reapplied. It&#39;s not fair. Especially the deep painted red of this lips. It still looks like they were painted next to an old &#39;55 Bel-Air.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is always been sexy when you talk cars.&quot; You have to kiss her. Any sexy woman that not only loves cars,  but loves working on them deserves to be shown all of the affection. She gives you that same coy emails that she always does. <br />
&quot;Well,  you&#39;ve always thought that my Tom Boy side was sexy,  now it&#39;s sexy for me seeing the lingerie and feminine side of you.  And trust me,  it&#39;s just as hot.  Actually,  it&#39;s time to to dress anyway.  Sexy undies only for my sexiness from now on, understood?&quot;<br />
You nod. Wendy has gotten more assertive and dominate since your transformation. You like how she would flex back and forth before,  but now when she was stern with you all of your insides clinch with joy. She is definitely a top with women.  And she is still showing you exactly how much woman you are. <br />
You both go out and she lays out your new sleeping outfit from the bag.   It&#39;s a black thong with matching black lacey underwire bra.   The bra pushes your tits up nice and high and shows off your cleavage. The string of the thong settles right across your butt hole and leaves you with a sexy feeling. <br />
Her outfit is almost the same except in red. With both of you dressed together you finally see the differences.   Her breasts are C cups and have always been nice,  but your DD just outshine them.   Likewise,  your ass is just a bit more round than hers. Her body has always done it for you and she is amazing as a person and wild in bed,  so you&#39;ve never wanted differently for her,  but right now you wish that you could make her look and feel as sexy as you do. <br />
&quot;So,  Jack and Jen told me that when they came here there was basically a contract that they needed to fill out and sign.  One modification per visit basically. Have you gotten a slip of paper or contract or anything?&quot; she asks. <br />
&quot;No,  just a the maroon swimsuit from the pool&#39;s list and found.   Even when we checked into our room they said they would email everything. How much did you talk to Jack and Jen about this place?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not much.  There is basically a gag order that you physically can&#39;t break.  There are things that you can&#39;t say about the place to anyone that hasn&#39;t gone. Actually if a person hasn&#39;t come here,  you can&#39;t say anything about it unless they bring it up to you first.  Even then you can only talk about things that they know you&#39;d be interested in.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then how did you know about the modification?&quot; We went to the balcony to talk pouring glasses of wine on our way. The view was amazing.  The sandy beach and the ocean was lit up by the moonlight.  It was an amazing night. Nice and warm with a gentle cooling breeze. <br />
&quot;Well.&quot; She went a bit red again and looked sheepish. &quot;Your trip overseas in January. The one where you couldn&#39;t contact anyone for about a month,  you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
&quot;I went over one Friday night and the three of us hit the hot tub. Lots of margaritas. You know how Jen makes them.  I was DRUNK.  And we were talking about sex and past experiences,  threesomes, lesbians, ect. I know that Jen was trying to get with me and Jack wanted a threesome.&quot;<br />
You should have been mad at this point,  your friends were trying to hook up with your girl while you were away.   Instead it just kinda made sense. <br />
&quot;I was missing you a lot,  but we didn&#39;t screw.  I told them about Julia. Great body,  great time in the sack,  totally crazy.  I told them that I was more than happy with you though and a threesome would be great,  but not if I didn&#39;t talk to you about it first.  Oh,  I also told them a foursome would be even better because your fat cock in Jen would rock her world. <br />
Anyway they understood and didn&#39;t press the issue.  Instead I did what I do when I&#39;m drunk. I talked. I said that if I had you and Julia and you could body swap,  then I&#39;d never leave the bedroom. If have to not have her craziness there, so I&#39;d have to find a way to put you in her body. Apparently saying that freed up some of the gag order. <br />
They asked if we&#39;d be interested in body modification. I told them that I was in love with the idea,  but wasn&#39;t sure your thoughts. They told me about some of the possibilities of this place and said that since they&#39;d been they could refer us.&quot;<br />
&quot;How did I not know any of this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Were you ever topless in the hottub with them talking about putting your boyfriend brain into a hot girl&#39;s body so that you could ravish them?&quot; All you can do is smile and shake your head at that one. &quot;The gag order was in place for you still. After we get home we can introduce Jack and Jen to Julia if you want or since all of us have been here,  you can go as yourself and we&#39;ll all be able to talk freely about everything.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean as Julia or myself?&quot; Your a bit concerned.  You could see yourself living out the rest of your life as Julia and kind of want to.   You hadn&#39;t even thought about changing back since you saw Wendy eye fucking you at the pool. <br />
&quot;You kept the clothes that you wore to the pool right?&quot; She was a bit frantic as she asked.  &quot;Holy crap I didn&#39;t even think to ask until now. Do you still have them?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah,  they&#39;re in the bag that I brought back.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh,  good.  I got a bit worried there.  Basically,  put them on and you change back and I get amazing dick.  Put that maroon swimsuit on,  I get all of this back.&quot; She ran her hand from your collarbone over your tit, down your stomach, and cupped your pussy. &quot;They told me that a few people have thrown away their clothes and can&#39;t change back and forth anymore. I could handle Julia full time,  but work and such is a pain to start all over again.&quot;<br />
You hadn&#39;t thought about what that would be like.  Show up to work in a week in a mini skirt,  heels,  low cut top, painted DSLs... that is actually nice to think about. Very nice actually.  But how would everyone react?  You can only imagine the questions from that. <br />
&quot;Um, I love this body and what it does for both of us. But let&#39;s go check on my old clothes.&quot; <br />
Wendy nods, &quot;Yeah,  we&#39;d better. And I need more wine.&quot;<br />
You both go in and while Wendy pours another glass you open the bag from the pool.</p>
