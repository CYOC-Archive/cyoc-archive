<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stirring from his slumber; Nate looks confused for a moment. Waking up in a room other than his, he realizes after feeling the warm furry body next to him that he is in Jean’s room at the Talbot house. Nate staring at the were-lioness as she slumbers; content to be next to a werewolf. Nate recalls, the spur of the moment action of yesterday when he proposed to Jean. Asking her to be his mate now and forever; it wasn&#39;t long before his impromptu proposal led to being married in the eyes of nature.<br />
<br />
After waking up from their were-wedding, Nate notices the ring on Jean’s finger still; a simple gold band with a small amber stone on it. A keepsake that has been in the Talbot family for generations; after Regina handed it to Nate, for asking if there were any onion rings to use as a marriage proposal. Now back in the present Nate stares at his wife.<br />
“Jean is my wife,” Nate quietly speaking; “my mate.&quot;<br />
Eliciting a low happy growl from speaking the last words; Nate starts rubbing his paws all over Jean’s tawny furred body. Exploring her curves and massaging her breasts. It wasn’t long before she started to wake up purring from the attention that a brown furred werewolf behind her was giving her.<br />
<br />
“Morning love,” Jean purring; “or should I say husband.”<br />
“Husband, mate,” Nate whispering in Jean’s ear; “it’s all the same isn’t it?”<br />
“That it is,” Jean chuckling happily; “up for a little morning fun? I still have a few hours left on the were-birth control pill I took yesterday.”<br />
“Always,” Nate feeling his lupine rocket rise up and press into Jean; “but just to be safe, take another pill so there is a healthy overlap.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
“Jean and Nate are up,” Leon swiveling his ears to the sound of growling and moaning coming from upstairs. Knowing that the two are clearly rutting; not as boyfriend and girlfriend, but as husband and wife.<br />
“Think we should interrupt them,” Leon sipping his coffee.<br />
“Let them have their moment husband,” Regina smiling; “they’ll be down soon enough.”<br />
“The sooner those two are up,” Leon speaking; “the sooner we can head over to the hospital to see Peter.”<br />
“But not without a decent breakfast in us first,” Regina getting up; “help me out here Leon; we have a mighty feast to prepare.”<br />
“All right,” Leon getting up; unable to help himself as he looks up as he hears his daughter roar in pleasure from her climaxing. ‘I’m going to miss hearing that when she moves out,’ Leon thinking to himself; ‘but I’m not going to miss a chance spoiling the crop of grandkids those two will give me.’<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Breakfast for Peter Talbot was a saline solution delivered through an I.V drip. Recovering in the hospital after being shot in the abdomen; the were-lion growls in pain as he wakes up from a dreamless sleep. After having two visits from the mysterious stranger; the first as he was at near death and the second when Peter was finally stabilized. Peter was able to think on three key things. First was the mysterious stranger was a dragon. Not just any dragon; but a dragon of mist and fog from the look of things. Second; Peter knew he was not gay. The mysterious stranger calling him gay was apparently the drive the were-lion needed to fight from not dying on route to the hospital. And thirdly; Peter owed a certain were-rabbit paramedic and apology for breaking his arm.<br />
<br />
Continuing to mull over the third thing; Peter can’t help but recall what the strange draconic man said.<br />
‘When you’re all rested up, you might want to apologize to the were-rabbit paramedic whose arm you broken. He has a sister you might take a shine too.’<br />
“A were-rabbit mate,” Peter speaking to himself; wincing through the pain he is currently in. “That’ll be something.”<br />
<br />
Just before Peter could continue dwelling on his thoughts; a nurse comes in to check on Peter. Seeing he is awake and clearly in distress, she gives him his pain medication and some water to swallow it down. Still grimacing from the searing wound in his gut, despite his hearty constitution and rapid healing. Peter struggles as he waits for the medication to kick in.<br />
“Where is Kyle,” Peter groaning; “the previous nurse that was here last night.”<br />
“His shift ended and hour ago,” the nurse speaking; “I’m Nurse Brenda and will attending to you for the day.”<br />
“Or up until you shift ends,” Peter coughing; “oh that hurt.”<br />
“Then don’t cough,” the nurse answering as she makes a note in her chart.<br />
“Perhaps I’ll roar instead,” Peter answering; seeing if he can get a rise out of the woman before him.<br />
<br />
Nurse Brenda looks at the were-lion before her; unafraid despite being a were-rabbit looks at the recovering man incredulously.<br />
“You got some nerve,” Brenda looking not to amused; “despite the fact that most of the staff are were’s, we have patients that are not.”<br />
“It’s not as if the normal here in town,” Peter responding; “don’t know about the existence of us were’s. After all a member of their family has to be one to help protect the town’s secret.”<br />
“Discretion is still necessary,” Brenda answering; “you of all should know that. What with your father’s position within the town.”<br />
“Don’t remind me,” Peter groans; “I loathe having to be the next were-lion king. Every single girl I meet,” Peter griping; “they only care about my position within the pride. A chance to be the queen,” Peter sneering; “it’s enough to make me sick.”<br />
“Then don’t be the next king,” Brenda speaking; “it’s not as if its mandatory now is it?”<br />
<br />
“Easier said than done,” a state trooper entering the hospital room causing the nurse to pause a bit before getting a strong scent of were-lion coming off the man. “Peter I need to ask you a few questions regarding the incident last night.”<br />
“I’ll leave you two alone,” Brenda finishing up and leaving.<br />
“Eugene,” Peter grimacing as he chuckles; “what the hell are you doing here? Last I heard you were patrolling around Spokane near the border to Montana?”<br />
“I’m now patrolling interstate 90,” Eugene answering; “in between Seattle and Ellensburg. How is king uncle?”<br />
“Dad is fine,” Peter responding; “still his usual self when it come to the were-lioness&#39;s at the pride. Grumbles when he has elder council business to deal with,” Peter continuing; “but would rather spend all day tinkering with the carburetor of 57 Chevy than anything else.”<br />
“And your sister,” Eugene asking; “How is Jean?”<br />
“Mated,” Peter answering; “she is with her mate, who happens to be a werewolf. Get this,” Peter rolling his eyes; “they had a were-wedding last night cousin.”<br />
“No shit,” Eugene looking surprised; “and you had to go ruin the happy moment by inviting a bullet to tear up your insides no less.”<br />
“Stop trying to make jokes,” Peter looking glum; “it’s not as if I’m happy for Jean, but why a werewolf?”<br />
“I could ask you a similar question,” Eugene responding; “why did you have your eye one the were-rabbit nurse as if you were smitten?”</p>
