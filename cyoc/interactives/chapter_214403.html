<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken was grinning at Jeff triumphantly as the tingles increased, building into a throbbing crescendo.<br />
<br />
“Hold on, I forgot, to change myself too,” Ken laughed and shook his head, tinkering with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
There was a beep from the machine as Ken’s inputs were accepted.<br />
<br />
The formerly doughy and pale teen suddenly grew taller. All his body hair flaked away, and his pasty skin grew a healthy tan. Jeff watched in wonder as his friend’s gut and moobs receded back into his body before he inflated with muscles. Even his brown eyes shifted to a rather alluring shade of green.<br />
<br />
Jeff bit his lip as he realized… his friend was kinda… hot. <br />
<br />
Like, his buzzed blonde hair and sparkling green eyes behind those glasses were fetching. That tan which went all the way to Ken’s groin, because he liked sunbathing in the nude, really accentuated his muscles. Yeah, Ken loved going to the gym. For some reason, Jeff thought that he’d been fat only moments before, but that was just silly!<br />
<br />
“All done!” Ken announced when the machine beeped again. “How do I look, babe?”<br />
<br />
Babe?<br />
<br />
Ken gave Jeff a rakish grin and flexed an arm, revealing a bicep the size of a cantaloupe. Was he getting even more muscular? Nah, couldn’t be. Jeff smiled at his handsome boyf-best friend’s antics. Ken was always showing off his sexy body.<br />
<br />
Something about Ken being sexy was… oddly wrong, but then, who was Jeff kidding.<br />
<br />
“You look hot,” Jeff blurted, then slapped a hand over his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, babe,” Ken winked, making Jeff’s heart flutter.<br />
<br />
Still, Ken had changed something about Jeff. He leaned forward, blushing a stray strand of blonde hair out of his eyes to see the screen. For some reason, his computer was blurry, like someone had smeared petroleum jelly on it. He let out a gasp as his puffy nipples brushed his shirt.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, babe?” Ken grinned.<br />
<br />
“Ken,” Jeff’s voice rose an octave as his Adam’s apple receded, “What’d you change about me?”<br />
<br />
Ken’s grin stretched wider, “Your hair color.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, pulling his long hair in front of his eyes. <br />
<br />
Blonde! That sexy devil had changed his brown hair blonde. What a nice guy. Jeff sighed in relief, leaning back as his chest swelled, pressing against his shirt and sending sparks of pleasure through him. Ken leaned forward and flicked a nip, making Jeff gasp and slap his hand away.<br />
<br />
“Babe, stop!” Jeff whined, his voice rising into a girlish soprano in tandem with his slowly inflating bust, “Those are so sensitive!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Jess, I’ll be gentle,” Ken’s eyes were on Jeff’s chubby breasts as they continued to grow.<br />
<br />
Jeff crossed his arms and huffed, accentuating his fat melons. As Ken watched, Jeff’s areolas began to widen, nipples beginning to poke the fabric of a shirt that was turning pink and tight around his breasts. He didn’t really feel comfortable with another guy touching his pecs. But…Ken was hot…<br />
<br />
Then Jeff relented, lowering his arms to his side and puffing out his chest.<br />
<br />
Ken pressed a hand under Jeff’s form-fitting half top and began massaging the supple flesh. Jeff wasn’t sure how to feel about it, but Ken lifted each one, weighing them in the palms of his big hands, and he felt their tips tingle. <br />
<br />
“Oh!” Jeff moaned, wondering why his tits were so sensitive today. <br />
<br />
His boyfrie-best friend continued rubbing, using his thumbs to brush Jeff’s nipples erect. Ken's fingers were electric, little sparks of pleasure erupting from each brush against Jeff’s nipples.  Jeff let out a quiet breath, his dick tenting his pants. What was going on with his body today? Jeff wriggled in his chair as his clothes grew tight around his groin. <br />
<br />
“You okay, Jess?” Ken asked, giving Jeff’s tits a gentle squeeze that made his groin twitch.<br />
<br />
“It’s Jeff,” Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure, babe?” Ken smiled and pulled Jeff’s shirt up over his tits, letting them flop out, sensitive nips exposed to the cold air of the room.<br />
<br />
“I-” Jeff gasped as Ken whirled his tongue around his breast.<br />
<br />
Ken suckled Jeff’s pert teat. Something built behind his nipple, a sort of pressure, making his boob feel tight. A pleasurable ache throbbed at the base of Jeff’s breast. Ken’s suction increased and the tension heightened. And then, to Jess’ relief, something warm trickled into Ken’s lovely mouth.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh,” Jess moaned, his cock achingly hard.<br />
<br />
Ken wiped his mouth off on Jeff’s shirt. “You've got some big tits, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
“Babe, my pants…” Jess huffed, not sure why his boyfriend was calling him Jeff.<br />
<br />
“I got you, babe,” Ken smiled.<br />
<br />
With expert hands, Ken unbuttoned his…his? Jeans and slid them down his legs, the friction removing any leg hairs left on his body, leaving them smooth and unblemished. Jess glanced down just in time to see his boxers turned frilly and white before compressing around his straining cock and balls, becoming a pair of wet panties.<br />
<br />
Gripping them with both hands, Ken pulled them down as well, and Jess groaned as his hips popped and widened, giving his a more feminine shape. His boyfriend smiled at his slender erection, which was steadily leaking precum.<br />
<br />
“All pent up, huh?” Ken said knowingly as he took his cock in his big, strong hands.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jess breathed. “Can you…blow me?”<br />
<br />
“Blow you?” Ken laughed, eyes dancing in a way that always got his heart fluttering. “Okay, sweetheart.”<br />
<br />
Ken knelt down, looking up a Jess.<br />
<br />
Jess bet his lip, not noticing it plump as the rest of his face softened. He gasped as Ken slid up and cradled his testes, pressing them against his body with a firm pressure that made sparks of pleasure dance in his mind. Then Ken took his cock in his mouth.<br />
<br />
He moaned as Ken gently suckled at the tip of his dick, the throbbing pleasure sending runners of bliss into his belly. The sensations began to shift, the feelings of his cock condensing as he nibbles lightly at the tip. Ken leaned forward and engulfed his cock.<br />
<br />
Jess’s balls pulled tighter to his body and his heart raced Ken he drilled his tongue against the head of his cock. Jess pressed the back of Ken’s head, enjoying the feel of his bristly hair and spread his legs wantonly. A strange ecstasy began to radiate from deep inside his abdomen the more Ken sucked and bobbed.<br />
<br />
“Ken!” Jess gasped as he felt his balls draw tight, nausea roiling his tummy.<br />
<br />
Ken didn’t stop, pressing Jess’s testes firmly in his groin. With a sickening *pop*, both of Jess’s balls were tugged inside of him. Jess’s scrotum remained, though the loose skin was folding oddly, a tight vertical ribbon of flesh running down its center. Ken’s tongue scraped against it as he continued to suck and lap at Jess’s groin.<br />
<br />
His boyfriend's mouth loomed impossibly large around Jess’s dwindling cock. The pleasurable sensations began to sink back into Jess’s groin and spread throughout the forming folds of his new femininity. Instead of sucking, his boyfriend was now lapping over a throbbing cockhead and then, a moment later, Ken’s tongue somehow slipped impossibly *inside* of Jess, making him gasp.<br />
<br />
Jess’s crotch seethed with new sensations, making him gasp as his former scrotum thrummed and swelled, his taut nub of a cock slipping inside her swollen femininity with the next roll of her boyfriend’s tongue. The next lap firmly tucked under her new labia, and a third lap reduced it to a throbbing, pea-sized button. Her groin twitched as her tested churned into a pair of ovaries. <br />
<br />
She shuddered and moaned, breasts softly aching as her boyfriend ate her out.<br />
<br />
He played her pussy like a fiddle, making Jess gasp and wheeze in delight every time his tongue slid and twisted inside of her straining passage. Her inner muscles squeezed around his probing tongue as a deep need bubbled up inside of her. She wanted something, something…thicker and longer than a tongue that would scratch this strange itch. <br />
<br />
Ken gave her pussy one last lick across her amazingly sensitive slit. Then he pulled away, leaving her moaning like a needy whore, her questing fingers dipping inside her pulsing folds. He gently pulled her hand away and kissed her on her plump lips.<br />
<br />
“You’ve got a nice, juicy pussy, Jeff,” Ken smiled up at his girlfriend, rubbing the edges of her cleft together, sending jolts of raw pleasure through her.<br />
<br />
“Uh!” Jess whined, “It’s… mmf! It’s Jess.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, my mistake,” Ken’s eyes danced again playfully, “Let’s take this to your bed, babe.”<br />
<br />
Jess nodded and got up, wobbling on shaky legs, fluids drooling down her thigh. Ken gave her ass a slap, her bouncy butt rippling and she shrieked. Then she turned, red faced and smacked him playfully on his shoulder. He grinned and picked her up before throwing her onto her bed.<br />
<br />
As she hit the sheets, her room began to change. Posters of football players and videogames were replaced with her favorite anime and cute little things from Japan. Ken was into that, but he liked the boy stuff. Her StationPlay 4 was replaced with a PII that she used to stream playthroughs of Crossing Animals. Yeah, she was a gamer, just like Ken. Finally, her bedsheets became pink and her bed was covered in stuffed animals of cute characters. <br />
<br />
“Don’t you think this is kinda creepy, you landing in bed with me?” Ken licked his lips as he took off his clothes, his fat cock springing to attention as soon as he pulled off his pants.<br />
<br />
“Of course not,” Jess’s eyes were on Ken’s thick dick ashe kicked off her tight jeans and panties, “Why would I be creeped out with getting fucked by a hot guy like you?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I am your best friend,” Ken smiled as he spread her legs wide, reveling the wet gash that puckered her groin. <br />
<br />
Ken sunk his digits into her honey-pot and began gyrating them. Sparks of bliss shot up from Jess’s pussy as his fingers squelched inside of her. She moaned as Ken thumbed his clit. Jess clenched around his fingers, wanting more, wanting to be filled, but Ken withdrew his fingers and licked them clean of her feminine juices.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, you taste good, Jess.” Ken grinned, his bright green eyes dancing as though he were laughing at some private joke. He gave his fingers another lick before stroking his cock. “You want this big dick in you, babe?”<br />
<br />
Jess stared down over her buoyant tits as her best friend and lover positioned himself at her entrance. She couldn’t deny how handsome he was, how big and juicy-looking that dick was. <br />
<br />
Despite the lusty feeling of dampness running through her belly, there was a voice in the back of her mind telling her that this was wrong. And not just any voice, it was a boy’s voice, and strangely familiar. But right now, in this moment, with her pussy aching so good… all she wanted was for Ken to… to…<br />
<br />
“Babe…” Jess breathed as the tip of Ken’s fat cock slipped between her voluptuous thighs and teased her glistening folds, “shut up and fuck me.”<br />
<br />
“My pleasure,” Ken cooed, rubbing his cock around the tender edges of her sex.<br />
<br />
He leaned forward, running his hands over Jess’s tender breasts, then rocked his hips. Jess’s breath caught in her throat as she felt the fat tip of his dick poke the entrance of her swollen pussy. She looked down and watched as Ken slowly sunk his tool into her, her wet folds spreading apart. Then Ken thrust himself all the way in, his balls slapping her gooch.<br />
<br />
She gasped, eyes popping open as he began to thrust, each one causing a soft jostle in her fat tits. She could feel them bouncing on her chest as Ken continued to plow her, his cock thrusting in and out of her glistening entrance, pressing up deeply inside of her. She could feel every inch of his thick pecker and spasmed and clenched around it.<br />
<br />
Ken gripped her hips and pulled her tight to his groin. She felt so hot and needy, her inner muscles twisting and twinging with pure bliss as he rocked and bucked his hips. <br />
<br />
“Ken!” She moaned, writhing around his throbbing pole, “Oh, Ken!”<br />
<br />
“Jeff,” Ken whispered in her ear. “I’m fucking you like a woman. Do you like it?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck me harder!” Jess whimpered, not caring what he called her.<br />
<br />
Ken grunted and thrust faster and faster, his balls pulling up tight. Jess arched her back against the table as her pussy began to quiver. They were small at first, but soon grew into full-body tidal waves of muscular contractions, each one more pleasurable at last. She cried, her shirt growing wet as something warm leaked from them. <br />
<br />
Her boyfriend’s shaft pulsed and shuddered as he unloaded inside of her. She could feel his cock bucking within her as he unleashed a hot blast of cum into her needy depths.  Jess’s insides clamped down, convulsing around his cock and milking him as Ken began to slow his thrusts.<br />
<br />
They kissed as he gently rocked inside of her twitching mound. She ran her soft hands over his back, feeling his muscles. The idea of such a big man claiming her pussy, making her squirt caused her pussy to contract again. She lay back, panting hard, sweat gleaming on her skin. <br />
<br />
The smell of sex filled the air. Ken withdrew, wiping his cock off on her thigh. He plopped down in bed beside her and played with her hair. Jess turned to Ken and kissed him again, enjoying his comforting presence. His hand dipped between her thighs and gentle played with her moist puss.<br />
<br />
“That was really good, Ken,” Jess murmured as they kissed.<br />
<br />
“I told you you’d enjoy it, Jess,” Ken said, smiling his dazzling smile, running his hand over her cheek, “You turned out perfect.”<br />
<br />
“You’re perfect,” Jess giggled, tossing one of her stuffed animals at him. <br />
<br />
He laughed and kissed her again. <br />
<br />
Eventually, he got up and put his clothes on. Jess lazily followed after, lighting a candle on her dresser and opening a window so her parents wouldn’t know what she and her boyfriend had been up to. She double checked that she was up to date on birth control and sighed with relief when she saw the empty pill. Jess certainly didn’t want to end up a teenage mother.<br />
<br />
Ken sat back on her computer chair and gestured for Jess to sit on his lap. She did, and he pulled her tight to his well-muscled chest. Her heart fluttered again as one of his hands pinched a nipple. It hurt, but in a good way. <br />
<br />
“You’re all mine, babe,” Ken whispered.<br />
<br />
“Mhmm,” Jess wriggled her plush bum against his groin, feeling his cock stir.<br />
<br />
“Naughty,” Ken smiled, tapping her nose. <br />
<br />
Jess blushed.<br />
<br />
“Alright, who should we change next, babe?” Ken said, kissing Jess’s neck.<br />
<br />
She shivered. “Anyone you want, Ken.”<br />
<br />
“Good girl,” Ken kissed her cheek and looked over her shoulder at the screen.<br />
<br />
Jess loved how confident his boyfriend was. As he scrolled through his possible targets, she wondered why he only changed her hair color. It didn’t really matter, they made a good couple and now their hair matched!<br />
<br />
She watched as Ken highlighted the name of their first target.<br />
<br />
“How about…” Ken said.</p>
