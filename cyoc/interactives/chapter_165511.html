<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The adults hooted when Arthur came out of the bathroom running and with a shit-eating grin in his face. Last year was a score when he got Dylan’s body and this year is a stroke of luck when he got Kyle’s clothes. Before Dylan became the family sweetheart resident jock, it was Kyle’s role when he joined the basketball team in his state school. He wasn’t good but the sport gave him a growth spurt no one in their family expected. From the frail redhead child who you’ll tease for his diminutive height, he transformed into a six-foot-two giant with legs that can last for days. Arthur used to be able to beat him in basketball when they played together but now, Arthur could barely make a point. And add to those great characteristics is his still cute maturing face. His eyebrows remained fiery red, a trait he got from her mother. He kept his hair short like his father who surprisingly did not get the early onset-baldness their family has.<br />
<br />
Arthur jumped high into the ceiling and did some imaginary hoops around the Christmas tree. The real Kyle who was now in the body of Rose could only facepalm himself in embarrassment as Arthur did additional provocative poses on top of the other ones.<br />
<br />
When the noise died down, Arthur came over to Drew who is still mulling over what Dylan said. Using Grindr while in Dylan’s body is such an Arthur thing to do. And to be honest, he’s thinking twice whether he’ll do what Arthur did before. He didn’t get a second chance at looking in the mirror but Drew is sure that men would flock over to him just to be fucked by the tight flesh hidden in his jockstrap. It’s not even hard, to begin with. How huge is this guy’s dick?<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Arthur said while rising his amber eyebrows and smiling cheekily. He didn’t do those things before in his body. Drew’s wondering why he is doing it now. Maybe his current look is giving him a huge dose of confidence? He doesn’t know but so far, he is liking it. And fuck! His jockstrap is getting tighter just by looking at his boyfriend doing all those things.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Drew replied, unsure about the nature of anything that has happened. This whole experience is life-changing, sure. But there is this nagging thought of awkwardness hanging behind his mind. Finding yourself in another body is a mile-far deviation from Drew’s reality. His biceps are too heavy but he has the strength to lift his gains. His voice vibrated differently in his throat. Everyone’s eyeing him with lust which is a rare thing to happen in his old form. He is complaining but he is not disliking it one bit. Maybe he will get used to it with time. Arthur mentioned the whole vacation trip only lasts two weeks. A few days is it’s going to take to get used to his current form.<br />
<br />
“Feeling awkward in your body?” Arthur asked. Just one look and he knew what’s happening with his boyfriend. “It’s okay. We experienced it too when it was our first time in someone else’s body.” Arthur sat down by the bench and drank a mugful of his aunt’s ginger ale. “Here, I’ll tell you about the first time I swapped with someone when I was three. Age three is the age where we do our first swap.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a pretty young age. Whom did you swap with?”<br />
<br />
“His name is Astor, a distant cousin of mine. He is not here anymore. His parents dragged him overseas. Sweden I think? Because that’s where his father lives. Anyway, he was 17 when I swapped with him. Jumping from age 3 to 17 is exciting but at the same time, scary. He’s not fat but his body is damn heavy. I was not used to the size of his biceps. I thought I’d love it but I laid awkwardly in bed for days, waiting only to be fed and bathed by my parents while they are on different bodies. It was awkward you know, my mom is inside Aunt Vespy’s 60-year-old body and my dad was a Jamaican guy Aunt Frida caught on her flings. I couldn’t play with my cousins because I outpaced them with my body. They called me a cheater so the only thing I could do is wait until the vacation is over.<br />
<br />
But the most awkward thing is, every night I’d lay in bed with the biggest boners I’ve had. And I’ve been swapping with these guys for years. I didn’t know then what a boner was and if I knew, I’d whack that shit every chance I could get in those two weeks. The only thing close to masturbation I did was those leftover dreams you’ll experience while in another body. It’s not dreams per se, more like stored memories innate to your body. And from my dreams, I’ve seen that Astor was more naughty than we gave him credit for. He’s fucking guys left and right in his university. He’s a fucking adonis, man. I always wake up with my dick throbbing and wet with cum. It happened half the days the entire time in his body. My mom would say it’s just a weird dream and the wetness in my dick was pee. If only, I knew.<br />
<br />
So, my point is. Staying in someone else’s body is an experience. Enjoy it, babe. Because I know, we’ll enjoy this hunk of junk.” Andrew cusped his balls and shook it, “Last time I’ve seen this thing is when I was ten and I’m excited to see how far this junk has grown.”<br />
<br />
Drew sipped on Arthur’s cup and let the lukewarm spiced ginger all wash his awkwardness away. He looked over the bathroom to see the latest commotion. Arthur mentioned that it is Uncle Clyde, Dylan’s hand. On his hand is a familiar thing to Drew since it was his Pajama. Mr. Clyde has this cheeky look on his face and he is rousing the crowd to tell whose pajama is in his hands. Some had their guesses but nothing came close to the real owner. Drew wanted to speak up but Arthur urged him not to. Surprises are the essence of this tradition, other than learning what it is to be on another shoe. Telling who owns the pajama would ruin the surprise. Drew laid back, sipped another ale, and waited for the transformation to happen in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Weird - that’s a word Drew expected when he waited for Mr. Clyde to come out of the bathroom. And well, it is weird and twice that. Mr. Clyde jumped out of the bathroom like a circus strongman flipping his old pants in his hands. It’s unnerving seeing your own body move without your volition, and even weirder when it did things Drew would never do in his entire life, such as kiss a bear of a man in his 40s who Drew assumed to be his wife. Mr. Clyde’s eyes darted around the room and when he saw the real Drew in his son’s body, he smiled and waved. It was a magnet that led the family’s gaze from him to Drew. The crowd howled in laughter.<br />
<br />
The ruckus died down and with it, Uncle Alf came over the podium who now looks like a short-cropped military man in his mid-20s. He’s looking pretty menacing with that brusque militaristic look. It’s suiting him quite nicely.<br />
<br />
“Now that everyone is finished, I must congratulate everyone for the entertainment. It’s a good thing nobody escaped this time. Ain’t I right Joshua?”<br />
<br />
Uncle Joshua who was now in a similarly aged woman’s body grumbled. <br />
<br />
“You know the drill guys, rooms are divided by family names and the luggage of your bodies are still in their respective cars. Enjoy the nights and wait for further announcements tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Dylan was about to get out and get the luggage of his body when he realized that he’s only wearing a jockstrap on. He kind of forgot since sitting by the fire erased all notions that he is naked at all. Arthur said that he’d get it by himself so Drew could walk ahead to their room.<br />
<br />
On his way, he bumped with the real Dylan who is still pouting at the body he’s in. He is still in his superhero underwear and crocs. Drew reckoned that his father must be outside carrying his luggage for him. It won’t be another ten or more minutes before they return. The parking lot is somewhat distant from the lodge and he knew Andrew would talk with the others, extending the time before they return.<br />
<br />
Dylan looked at Drew’s body from top to bottom and sighed. “At least my body did not go to my horny uncles and definitely not to Arthur. How’s my body faring you?”<br />
<br />
“Good. I’m uh… getting used to it. How about you?”<br />
<br />
“Still angry with my dad who now has your face. I am so angry but he is not taking me seriously since I am in little Noah’s body. Wait till I get back and fucking punch him in the knockers.” <br />
<br />
It is kind of cute seeing him this way. For such a young-looking kid, he’s speaking disproportionately mature. Drew bets that it would be a common occurrence around his two-week stay in the house.<br />
<br />
“Well, see you tomorrow. Noah’s dad said that this kid hadn&#39;t taken a bath yesterday and asked me to take a bath in his place.” Just before leaving, Dylan reached in and squeezed Drew’s ass. Drew was taken for a surprise since he did not expect any of that. “Damn, I’ll miss that ass. Take care of my body, you hear?”<br />
<br />
Drew nodded.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Drew’s estimate was wrong. It did not take ten minutes before Arthur returned, rather, it took three times longer. He got tangled with helping others carry their luggage. And seeing that he’s in Kyle’s strong body, he could not help but fill his inflated ego. Then he crossed paths with the real Kyle in Rose’s body and begged Arthur not to do anything gay to his body, not that he’s homophobic or anything. He knows what Arthur did to Dylan’s body last year and he does not want it to happen to his body too. Arthur said he would try not to do the same thing last year. The keyword here is “try”, and by try, he means he would fucking do it again. And lastly, Arthur met Mr. Clyde who is enjoying Drew’s body so far. He commented on the fact that his hips feel golden. His joints are rubber and he could bend them in ways more than his old body. Lastly, he said he won’t get angry if things get freaky between Arthur and his son’s body. Dylan is fucking his boyfriend raw back in their state so it won’t change a thing if he fucked boys here in the lodge. <br />
<br />
Arthur came into the room carrying their luggage containing their clothes and essential supplies. He also did not forget their phones which remained locked since he has a different set of fingerprints. It is a good thing he left a pin lock.<br />
<br />
“Drew?” Arthur called out, “I’m taking a bath, do you want to join in? The electric heater is broken so they are using the old one but they will only leave it on until 10 PM.”</p>
