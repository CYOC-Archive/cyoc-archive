<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Escorting his charges to their classrooms, Jeff bid them a good day. It brought a smile to his face, watching the formerly burnt out adults return to an age of innocence and excitement. The children excitedly greeting their teacher before taking their seats.<br />
<br />
Jeff now found himself stalking the halls, thinking of what to do with Alicia. The two had talked but she was still tight lipped about the pregnancy. She still needed to figure out what to say to her mother. Jeff realized though she was running short on time, it would only be a matter of time before she started showing. The second reason for Jeffs walk was a bit more mischievous. <br />
<br />
Armed with the Chronovac, Jeff was practically daring one of the elderly teachers to stop him. Once that happened, Jeff knew the kindergarten class would have a new addition. It didn&#39;t take long for Jeff to find what he was looking for.<br />
<br />
Mr. Reed, the ancient middle school science teacher now turned the corner.  Thin with wild hair and what Jeff believed to be a touch on senility, the man should have retired years ago. Instead, the mad scientist looking teacher taught 7th and 9th grade science, Jeff recalling how the man often times would forget what he was teaching mid lecture.  &quot;Hey what are you doing here,&quot; Mr. Reed asked. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be in class?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wasted no time, scanning Mr. Reed.<br />
<br />
Name: Maxwell Reed<br />
Age: 80<br />
Mental Age: 80 (early dementia)<br />
Height: 5&#39;9&quot;<br />
Weight: 140lbs<br />
Build: Thin<br />
Gender: Male<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh he is senile,&quot; Jeff thought. Quickly he now scanned the elderly teacher. Taking a glance at the stats.<br />
<br />
Name: Max Reed<br />
Age: 5<br />
Mental Age: 5<br />
Relationship:  Arthur Davis (best friend), Cheyenne Evans (friend)<br />
Height: Auto<br />
Weight: Auto<br />
Build: Auto<br />
Alter Reality to fit: yes<br />
Alter clothes: yes delayed<br />
<br />
A smirk spreading across Jeffs face as he activated the Chronovac and beheld his work.<br />
<br />
Mr. Reeds brown eyes glazed over, Jeff noticing the initial changes. Slowly but surely the man&#39;s hair went from white to grey, his hairline gradually inching up his scalp. By the time Mr. Reed hit 60. Jeff noted the man&#39;s wrinkles had begun to smooth, his body skinny but no longer as frail.<br />
<br />
Still Max retreated in age, Jeff watching as his hairline continued to inch forward, dark brown strands of hair slowly but surely overtaking the the grey. Max now left his 50s behind, entering his more vigorous 40s. The man still had his wild unkempt hair but now Jeff had flashes of a intelligent with somewhat eccentric teacher.<br />
<br />
Now Max retreated through his 30s, Jeff watching the wrinkles and lines vanish from the man&#39;s face, the remainder of the grey in his hair vanishing. By the time Max hit 30 Jeff beheld a skinny man with a receding hairline. Apparently male patter baldness had taken its toll on Max at a relatively young man.<br />
<br />
Now though Jeff had found a rather unorthodox cure for baldness as Max reentered his 20s. Max&#39;s hair now began to creep forward much faster, completely covering the man&#39;s scalp as he hit an energetic looking 25. Jeff noting the energetic dark eyes of the young teacher, his frame appearing more wirey than skinny with a small amount of muscle now straining the man&#39;s dress shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess he worked out a bit in college,&quot; Jeff mused.<br />
<br />
Max now retreated back to college, the small amount of muscle thinning under the man&#39;s dress shirt. Max&#39;s face now rounded slightly, Jeff guessing that in his youth Mr. Reed was often carded for alcohol. The readout may have said he was 21 but he looked closer to 18.<br />
<br />
As Max now became 18 and reentered high school, Jeff noted the almost boyish quality of his face. Max was obviously more of a bookworm than an athlete. Max was rail thin, his face boyish with wild dark brown hair. Jeffs memories adjusting as he gazed at the high school senior. Max was jokingly referred to as the absent minded professor. He was brilliant but a tad forgetful.<br />
<br />
As Max retreated through high school, Jeff could see the boy getting shorter. It appeared he had been a bit of a late bloomer, his muscles thinning, his face rounding. By the time he became a fresh faced Freshman of 15, Jeff noted the boy had lost at least 4 inches in height.<br />
<br />
Now the changes were increasing rapidly, Max&#39;s beight drastically dropping. Jeff now watched as the grown man&#39;s long sleeves inched over his hands, completely engulfing them by the time he became a boy of 12. If Jeff had found the boy to be skinny before than he was practically a stick now. Max was skin and bones, his face round, his hair though remaining wild.<br />
<br />
Now Max&#39;s regression was entering its final stages. Thw boy was shrinking rapidly, Jeff finding it comical, this young boy engulfed in his former adult clothing. Max&#39;s slacks, which had barely clung to his waist before now cascaded around his ankles. Jeff could see the boys skinny legs and bony knees, which were quickly covered as his dress shirt quickly drooped lower, eventually covering the boy to his shins.<br />
<br />
Jeff now found himself looking down at the tiny 5 year old, swamped in his adult clothing. Clothes that quickly began to adjust to the tiny boys body. Max&#39;s shirt transforming into a tshirt with a dinosaur, his slacks drawing up to the boys waist and becoming a sturdy pair of jeans with a pair of blue sneakers. Blinking as the regression completed, Jeffs memory aligned to remember Max.<br />
<br />
Max was Arties best friend and already seen as a child prodigy. Despite reading well above grade level, his parents wished for him to remain with his friends. Those friends, Artie and Cheyenne, were in Jeffs mind the equivalent of what Tommy, Ryan, and Jane were. Max was a sweet, somewhat dorky kindergartener he was too smart if somewhat forgetful. &quot;Are you lost again Max,&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
Max rubbed his chin, craving his neck upwards to look at Jeff. &quot;I think so,&quot; he lisped. &quot;Can you take me back to class?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, taking the boys hand as he led him back towards kindergarten. A smile on his face as he placed yet another adult in early childhood.</p>
