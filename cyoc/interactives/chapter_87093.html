<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before shi left Justin and Francine&#39;s chateau with Anubis, Janace had visited with Francine and Justin and looked in on their little ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re precious, Justin,&quot; Janace smiled as shi held Janace Est Mon Ami in hir arms, &quot;They&#39;re absolutely precious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they are, sith,&quot; Justin said to hir as shi stood beside hir former wife, &quot;and they came out of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re quite the proud mother,&quot; Janace commented, &quot;Interesting... considering you were a man...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what it&#39;s like to feel pleasure as a man... feeling the female side of things is newer and... I like both... they&#39;re both very good...&quot; Justin answered, &quot;and maybe this is the Kat DNA in me now... but feeling life inside me... feeling them grow... it just made me happy. Especially when I could feel my soughters push against me to try and touch Francine when we were together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace nodded, remembering how often she had found Sally and Charlie sitting together with their swollen wombs pushing against each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when you and Anubis mate... you&#39;ll find yourself greatly enjoying the male side of things,&quot; Francine added, and gave a short laugh, &quot;Before I became a Chakat I was rather fearful of a lot of it. I still loved Alexis, and would do anything to protect hir... but I was scared when I became a Kat...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now?&quot; Anubis wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it,&quot; Francine smiled, &quot;I delivered Snowflake... and I love the feel of Justin&#39;s vagina around my penis... I love the feel of being pregnant and bringing more Kats into the world... I love Justin... and I love you, Janace... as a sither obviously.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace only returned Janace Est Mon Ami to Justin&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Janace replied, &quot;I&#39;m grateful that we could all put aside our differences in the past and remain on good terms...&quot;<br />
<br />
Francine and Justin both nodded. Meanwhile, Anubis looked over to a wall clock nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janace, my love, we&#39;d best get back to the hotel and get the others for our tour,&quot; Anubis commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hotel?!&quot; Justin gasped, &quot;you aren&#39;t staying here!? We have more than enough room!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get the feeling that Sally, Jess, and Janice want the reception and much of the ceremony to be a surprise,&quot; Janace answered, &quot;and so they have us on a bit of a European tour starting with Paris...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wedding is a surprise?&quot; Francine wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all gave them elements of what we wanted from the ceremony, but the big thing they&#39;re getting ready is the reception and so forth,&quot; Anubis spoke, &quot;and they were actually quite diligent in seeing what we wanted...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then hopefully, it&#39;ll be a pleasant surprise,&quot; Justin gave a giggle.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Later, when they prepared to leave the Louvre, Timothy and Casey Jones were stopped by Janace before they could head toward the exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to do this before the wedding?&quot; Janace asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love hir, Janaccccccccccccccce,&quot; Timothy spoke, &quot;my heartssssssssssssssss flutter when I ssssssssssssssssee hir... I can&#39;t ssssssssssssssssssee mysssssssssssssssself with anyone but Casssssssssssssssssey Jones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In that way... the wedding is a ceremony that makes it official,&quot; Casey Jones added, &quot;as far as we are concerned... we are already married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace watched as Casey Jones placed hir arm around Timothy&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thissssssssssssssss isssssssssssssssss the ccccccccity of love,&quot; Timothy smile, &quot;I want to be clossssssssssssssse to my mate...&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace paused then nodded. Kats almost always seemed to be very sexual creatures. Shi sensed this hearing the cries at night and the fact that Justin and Francine had flat out stated that they loved it. Shi also had a hard time saying shi didn&#39;t feel this, hirself. Shi hadn&#39;t let herself get far enough that shi&#39;d become aroused, but shi could feel the basic desire, and shi knew that shi and Anubis would probably mate as soon as they could after the wedding and they&#39;d become just as sex-crazed as any other Kat. In that shi knew the wedding couldn&#39;t come soon enough for hir, and knowing that Casey Jones had really brought Timothy out of hir earlier depression, shi couldn&#39;t deny either Kat their happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll let you know when we leave Notre Dame Cathedral,&quot; Janace told them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Timothy smiled and hugged Janace and then Anubis and strode out beside Casey Jones.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Timothy and Casey Jones were kissing almost as soon as they made it inside their hotel room.  They loved each other and felt that together they had healed their old wounds together and felt ready to show each other how much truly loved each other. Casey Jones hastily pushed the door shut with hir tail and pulled Timothy to hir as they kissed, feeling a bit ticklish as Timothy&#39;s long tongue wrapped around hir own and the forked tips even tickled the rough of hir mouth. They kissed passionately, even as Casey Jones felt Timothy&#39;s clawed fingers brush over hir breasts and began to undo the buttons on hir blouse. The caress was soft and smooth, and Casey Jones felt hirself grow wet and as hir member began to grow erect between hir rear legs. Shi then returned the same caress to Timothy&#39;s breasts, giving a lingering flick to where Timothy&#39;s nipples where covered by hir shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re ssssssssssssssso beautiful,&quot; Timothy said as shi undid the last button on Casey Jones&#39; blouse, exposing the Tyrannosaur Dinokat&#39;s large breasts. Shi then brought hir lips to one of Casey Jones&#39; nipples as they grew hard and pushed out from behind Casey Jones&#39; scale-like feathers. &quot;Ssssssssssssssso beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you,&quot; Casey Jones answered with a moan and removed hir mate&#39;s shirt as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sssssssssssssorry if my breassssssssssssssssstssssssssssssssss aren&#39;t big enough,&quot; Timothy said slowly, feeling rather conscious about how small hir chest was, especially when compared to the large orbs that hung on Casey Jones&#39; chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your breasts are perfect,&quot; Casey Jones spoke, and brought hir muzzle down to look closely to Timothy&#39;s eyes, &quot;Soft yet firm... sensitive yet strong... you don&#39;t need to have big breasts to be beautiful...&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy felt hirself growing wetter and wetter. She was ready for Casey Jones to enter hir cloaca, as shi felt hir hemipenis begin to push out as Casey Jones fondled hir scale covered breasts. Every flick of hir tongue gave hir the ability to sense Casey&#39;s own arousal. Shi was ready too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Timothy gave a slight smile and turned around to present hirself, &quot;I&#39;m ready for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Casey Jones smiled and brought hirself up behind Timothy, pushing the Komokat&#39;s tail to a side and raising up onto hir rear legs to mount hir mate. It wasn&#39;t too much for hir, as Timothy stood a little bit lower to the ground than shi did, but shi did have to raise hirself up a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss,&quot; Timothy gave a long moan as shi felt Casey Jones&#39; penis penetrate hir and shi rotated hir torso so that shi could face hir mate.<br />
<br />
As Casey Jones began to thrust further into Timothy, shi gave hir own moan as Timothy again began to play with hir nipples, sending shock waves of pleasure through hir large, proud, and feathered breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Tim,&quot; Casey Jones moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Timothy answered and then commanded, &quot;Harder! Thrusssssssssssssst harder!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
While Timothy and Casey Jones enjoyed each other&#39;s company, the rest of the tour group finished their tour of the Louvre and then began their walk along the River Seine until they came up to the closest bridge that would allow them cross onto the island that Notre Dame de Paris sat on. The Gothic Cathedral could easily be seen and looked very bright as they got closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Anubis wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A beautiful peace of architecture indeed,&quot; Janace agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say you were the President of Egypt once?&quot; Strawberry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was once,&quot; Anubis answered, &quot;but I finished out my term and... regardless of my faith, that doesn&#39;t mean that I cannot admire other&#39;s cultures and imagery...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our wedding will actually be combining Christian and Muslim traditions,&quot; Janace told the pink Scorpkat, &quot;to show that love trumps everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Strawberry nodded and tagged along. Shi felt greatly relieved that Brent had forgiven hir, and was privately interested in seeing the children shi sired. The group all appeared to be good friends, and Strawberry was greatly surprised to see that they were all getting ready for a massive triple wedding... perhaps even a quadruple wedding, if the flirtations shi noticed between the two Unikats give to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t the cathedral have a large number of stain glass windows?&quot; Elise wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe it does,&quot; Janace commented, &quot;Gothic Cathedrals tended to be built to make them a bigger part of the cathedral...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe we&#39;ll see the hunchback,&quot; Kathy gave a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a fictional character,&quot; Sarah commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a joke,&quot; Kathy sighed.<br />
<br />
Janace only shook hir head as they approached the cathedral. As they did so, shi could hear the sound of sobbing inside, which surprised hir.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;OH... OH... YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!&quot; Timothy cried as shi came again, sending bursts of semen from hir hemipenis and finally feeling Casey Jones&#39;s member erupt inside hir.<br />
<br />
Casey Jones gave a pleasure filled roar as shi had hir orgasm and once it subsided, shi dismounted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wonderful, Timothy,&quot; Casey Jones spoke, &quot;a perfect mate... perfect for me. I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Timothy answered, &quot;but now it issssssssssssss my turn to mount you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casey Jones nodded and turned around as Timothy did the same.Timothy climbed up and was soon thrusting hir hemipenis into Casey Jones&#39; cloaca and pleasure filled bellows and hisses began to rise again.</p>
