<p>&quot;Oh, it's not that I don't like dogs,&quot; she quickly replied, &quot;I just am more 
into ......... something smaller.&nbsp; I live in a tiny apartment and don't 
really have space for Jingles.&nbsp; If he were a cat, or gerbil, or something 
like that, I wouldn't feel so bad leaving him alone at home so much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my yes, I do 
know what you mean.&nbsp; These larger dogs need space to run.&nbsp; Perhaps you 
just need a different collar,&quot; the old man remarked.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Here.&nbsp; I 
happen to have just the thing.&quot;&nbsp; With that, he handed Katie a white collar.&nbsp; 
John couldn't help but realize that the collar seemed a bit small, even for his 
new neck size.</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn't 
really look like it will fit my Jingles, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no... don't 
worry about all of that.&nbsp; Just try it on him.&nbsp; I assure you that you 
will be satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>Katie took the 
collar and began to place it around John's neck.&nbsp; He wanted to resist, but 
was afraid that the wizard would do something worse to him.&nbsp; He had to play 
his cards well.&nbsp; He may only get one chance to free himself from this 
nightmare.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I was 
wrong,&quot; Katie said.&nbsp; &quot;It does fit.&quot;</p>
<p>John was a bit 
taken back by that remark, but he was even more taken back when he felt himself 
lifted into the air.&nbsp; He then was turned so that he was face to face with 
Katie.&nbsp; She was now huge!&nbsp; John felt as though her head was almost 
half his own size.&nbsp; He screamed in surprise, but all that came out was <b>
<i>MREOOOW!</i></b></p>
<p>&quot;Oh don't you 
complain you big baby,&quot; Katie said to him.&nbsp; &quot;I'm sure you will get used to 
it.&nbsp; Besides, just wait until all those lady cats see you all spiffed up.&quot;&nbsp; 
She then turned him toward the old man and reached one of her arms out forward.&nbsp; 
He shook her hand and the transaction was complete.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for 
your business ma'am.&nbsp; If you have any difficulties in the future, please do 
not hesitate to return to the store,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I will, sir.&nbsp; 
You have been most helpful.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p>John could have 
swore that he saw the old man wink at him as he was lifted onto Katie's shoulder 
and carried out of the store.&nbsp; He tried to wiggle his was out of her arms, 
but he was too weak.&nbsp; He could have bit her to free himself, but he didn't 
want to harm her.&nbsp; After all, it wasn't her fault.&nbsp; She was under a 
spell also.&nbsp; He needed time to get her on his side.&nbsp; Once they were 
home he would be able to convince her of his plight.&nbsp; He may not be able to 
speak, but there were other ways to communicate.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It didn't take 
too long to arrive back at the apartment.&nbsp; John had always considered it 
such a small place, but it was enormous from his perspective at the moment.&nbsp; 
He was sent down on the floor once inside the entrance.&nbsp; This prompted him 
to immediately go into the bedroom to collect some tools.&nbsp; John had it all 
planned out.&nbsp; He knew how to make Katie believe his story.&nbsp; He just 
needed some things... and some food.&nbsp; Boy, was he getting hungry.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&quot;Jingles?&quot; he 
heard coming from the other room.&nbsp; &quot;Dinner time.&quot;</p>
<p>Dinner time?&nbsp; 
Great.&nbsp; Just a quick bite and then back to business.</p>
<p>John headed back 
into the living room and turned toward the kitchen.&nbsp; He stopped for a 
moment when he realized that his &quot;dinner&quot; was being removed from a tin can.&nbsp;
<i>Cat food ?! You have got to be kidding me,</i> he thought to himself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But John was just 
plain famished.&nbsp; So what if it came from a can.&nbsp; So does tuna.&nbsp; 
Hmmm... tuna... and chicken.&nbsp; He could smell it.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; 
So tempting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a quick bite.</p>
<p>He couldn't take 
it any more.&nbsp; He ran over to the bowl on the ground and gulped down on his 
feline feast.</p>
<p>&quot;My you're a 
hungry feller tonight,&quot; Katie said, smiling.&nbsp; &quot;When your finished, we can 
play with your new toys that I bought today.&quot;</p>
<p>John felt 
something odd as he ate the meal.&nbsp; There was some stirring in his thoughts.&nbsp; 
Maybe being a cat wasn't so bad after all.&nbsp; Free food... lazy afternoons... 
no responsi-&nbsp; </p>
<p><i>NO!&nbsp; I am 
NOT a cat!&nbsp; I am a man!</i> he quickly correct himself.&nbsp; What was 
happening?&nbsp; Why was he losing his train of thought?&nbsp; He had to keep 
focus.&nbsp; That.. that stupid collar.&nbsp; It must still be affecting him.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If he didn't get it off soon, he might find himself forever Jingles, both in 
body and mind.</p>
<p>He saw the back 
door to the apartment.&nbsp; He ran to it and scratched it hoping that Katie 
would allow him out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Time for 
nightlife already?&nbsp; I wish that I had that kind of social schedule,&quot; she 
said, opening the door.&nbsp; &quot;There you go... but don't stay up all night 
mister.&quot;</p>
<p>He scooted out 
the door an into the back alleyway.&nbsp; He knew that several sharp objects 
were bound to be accessible near the garbage bins.&nbsp; He made his way toward 
them, hoping to find something that he could use to snare the collar and cut it.&nbsp; 
What he didn't expect to find was....&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
