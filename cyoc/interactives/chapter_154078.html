<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Author&#39;s Note: Apologies for the typos in the last chapter as I wrote it on my phone.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a minute of thinking Thomas decided to opt for the more infantile method of announcing he needed changing. His choice set he mentally steeled himself for what he was about to do which was cry like the baby he was. Though he was a little more than nervous he was also at the same time very excited at purposely causing a loud and vocal outburst to cause his caretaker to come running. He most certainly didn&#39;t feel any shame as he was a toddler now and everyone knew toddlers weren&#39;t the best at controlling their emotions.<br />
<br />
There was a reason they called it the &quot;terrible twos&quot;, even if he was technically still six months away from the two year old mark.<br />
<br />
Taking a few deep breaths Thomas slowly relinquished his adult level control and instead concentrated on the babyish urges that lay just under the surface, the very ones he had up until this point not paid much attention to and had been easily able to ignore. Dredging them up he then focused those emotions toward the soggy pamper he was wearing beneath his shorts. &quot;I&#39;m wet&quot; he thought to himself in his mind, &quot;I wet myself&quot;. Wiggling his legs he felt his damp padding squish underneath his bottom as Thomas immediately thought, &quot;I wet my diapie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whereas earlier that simple observation had made him happy now that he was operating on a younger mindset the realization that his crinkly underwear was soaked made him unhappy...<br />
<br />
Very unhappy.<br />
<br />
Frowning deeply Thomas began to squirm in place, &quot;I don&#39;t wanna be wet&quot; he mentally whined, a whimper escaping his lips, &quot;I wanna be dry, I don&#39;t wanna wet diapie anymore...I want&quot;<br />
<br />
The toddler felt his throat get tight as he began to choke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna...&quot; he forced out as tears filled his eyes and obscured his vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;I WANNA NEW DIAPIE!!!&quot; Thomas mentally shouted in his head as the dam holding back his emotions broke and they came out full force.<br />
<br />
His cries first came out as choking sobs that quickly escalated into long bouts of wailing, the loudness of which increased as time when on. And crying wasn&#39;t the only thing he did as he also proceeded to pound his arms against the couch cushions and kick his legs wildly in the air, openly and visibly displaying his frustration to the world. By this point Thomas couldn&#39;t stop himself if he wanted to as he was fully immersed in his crying fit and he needed someone&#39;s help to calm him down and bring him out of it, unable to do so on his own.<br />
<br />
Lucky for him then that Sarah came rushing into the living room not two minutes after he had started crying.<br />
<br />
Needless to say the sight of seeing her one and a half year old employer lying on his back on the couch and throwing a tantrum shocked her quite a bit despite knowing Thomas&#39;s regressive tendencies. Immediately taking a seat beside the young boy on the couch Sarah pulled the crying toddler into her lap, holding him close in her arms and shushing him while patting him on the back. The comfort and physical attention slowly allowed Thomas to bring his crying down somewhat in volume, going from a loud unrestrained bawling his lungs out to a light crying fit that didn&#39;t hurt the ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, there Thomas. What&#39;s wrong? Why are you crying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made...pee pee&quot; he managed to choked out through his crying.<br />
<br />
Hearing his answer Sarah merely grinned. She had figured his crying had something to do with his diaper though based on the amount of wailing he had done she assumed he had made a poopie in his pants.<br />
<br />
Smiling to herself she readjusted Thomas&#39;s position in her lap so she was cradling him with one arm while she reached down with her other and undid the fly of his shorts. Pulling aside the flaps revealed the yellowed front of his pampers which squished when she pressed her hand against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s what&#39;s got my baby boy all upset. Sheesh, if you made this much fuss over going tinkle I’d hate to see what you do when you end up making a stinky&quot; Sarah replied playfully and despite still being emotionally upset Thomas couldn&#39;t help but let out a giggle at her comment.<br />
<br />
Redoing the fly on his shorts Sarah slowly got up from the couch while keeping a firm grip on her young charge, holding the lightly crying toddler over her shoulder as she headed in the direction of the staircase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go pay a little visit to the changing table, shall we?&quot; she asked gently patting and rubbing his back as she ascended the steps one by one.<br />
<br />
By now Thomas had calmed down enough that he was only quietly sobbing, the fact that Sarah had mentioned getting him a new diaper having a bit to do with it. Reaching the second floor landing she walked down the hallway and entered the first door on the right and stepped into his room...or rather his nursery. Well it wasn&#39;t so much a nursery as it was a toddler&#39;s bedroom since it contained elements of both, though it did lean closer to the latter given the age he settled on. It had space themed wallpaper with stars, planets and rocket ships decorated all four walls, a large dresser, a wall mounted flat screen with an entertainment center below it that was stocked with video games and movies (mostly children&#39;s animated). And near the center of the room a race car bed in the shape of Lightning McQueen from Cars, a favorite Disney character of his.<br />
<br />
However to prove that the young boy who inhabited this room wasn&#39;t too grown up and still quite a baby there was a toy chest full of toys for ages five and below, a crib tucked away in the corner for when he didn&#39;t feel like sleeping in a big boy bed,  a rocking chair for those more intimate moments, and lastly his current destination; a changing table fully stocked with the two biggest brand name diapers: Pampers and Huggies. When it came to padding Thomas preferred Pampers given how well they were made but also because he really really liked the sound of the name. However he thought he should give the other kind a try since he wanted to make the most of his second babyhood. And while he didn’t plan on potty training at all he also had A couple of packs of pull-ups on hand and a plastic potty chair in case he wanted to play pretend but with every intention of failing.<br />
<br />
Feeling as he was carefully laid down on the padded table top Thomas gazed up at Sarah with teary eyes as she quickly removed his shorts, leaving only his wet pamper to cover his lower half. Fetching the supplies from underneath just as fast she began to undo the tapes holding his pee-soaked padding together, the opening of which released the scent of urine and allowed the cool air to waft over his damp crotch. Shivering at the coldness he stuck his thumb in his mouth out of reflex sucking on it as his favorite part of the change began in earnest and his privates were assaulted with numerous baby wipes. As Sarah gently and thoroughly cleaned the pee from his soft sensitive skin Thomas’s frown morphed back into a smile. However his face remained slightly red from the tantrum he threw and his cheeks were moist from his tears. Still Sarah noticed the turn around in the toddler’s mood and made to mention it.<br />
<br />
“Looks like my little guy’s all happy again” she said giving the one and a half year old a smirk, “So did you enjoy being a big old crybaby Thomas.”<br />
<br />
His cheeks reddening Thomas nodded behind his thumb, unable to stop grinning like a cheshire cat as she lifted up both his legs while simultaneously moving a baby wipe between them as she transitioned to his bottom.<br />
<br />
“Good…just don’t make too much of a habit out of it, especially when we’re out in public” Sarah replied as she wiped both of his bare cheeks, cupping each with her hands as she did so.<br />
<br />
“Okay” Thomas replied pulling out his thumb.<br />
<br />
Once she was done she disposed of the used wipes and diaper before reaching under the table for a new one with one hand while still holding his legs up with the other, “So Thomas which brand do you want, Pamper or Huggies?’ she asked her charge.<br />
<br />
“I think I wanna try a Huggies this time” he answered feeling adventurous.<br />
<br />
“One Huggies coming right up” she replied and plucked a pair of the aforementioned brand, giving it a shake to unfold it before slipping it under Thomas’s rear end. His legs being set down sooner afterward the baby boy squirmed with delight as he was swiftly powdered and taped up into a clean diaper, relishing his second change of the day.<br />
<br />
Lifting his head up to get a glimpse of the Huggies he was wearing he saw that the front had a picture of Winnie the Pooh.<br />
<br />
His smile turned a tad mischievous as the character’s name gave him an idea of which exactly to do in this new diaper of his.<br />
<br />
Thomas’s thoughts were interrupted when Sarah spoke again.<br />
<br />
“Alright now just lie still so I can put your shorts back on.”<br />
<br />
Seeing her reach for the clothing the toddler quickly shook his head, “No.”<br />
<br />
“No?” she repeated.<br />
<br />
“I don’t like my shorts because they cover up my diapie” he pouted with crossed arms.<br />
<br />
Sarah merely grinned in realization, “Ah I see, you want everyone to see them so you can show off just how much of a baby you are.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh” Thomas nodded seriously as if this was a well known fact, which it was.<br />
<br />
“Fine I won’t make you wear shorts or pants unless absolutely necessary” she complied.<br />
<br />
Happy at easily getting his way Thomas uncrossed his arms as Sarah lifted him up into a sitting position on the edge of the table. His feet hanging off the edge he let them swing freely as he enjoyed the soft feel of the Huggies under his butt.<br />
<br />
“Alright now that you’re taken care of in the diaper department” she said with a wink before continuing, “I think it’s time we…”</p>
