<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the change, Jacob was set on his tiny bare feet and given a pat on his freshly-diapered rump, sending him toddling off in a haze of bliss. He made it only a few steps before he plopped onto his poofy bottom and simply watched the show, grinning from ear to ear as each of his friends were changed in turn. James proved just as playful with them as he had been with him, favoring the squirming, giggling boys with nuzzles and cuddles and tickles galore. As with James, each of them seemed to enjoy their changes almost as much as the acts that necessitated them, relishing in the simple pleasure of being cared for with such deep and obvious affection. <br />
<br />
Soon each of his friends were in fresh new diapers (save for David, whose Cars Pull-Ups were on full display after he begged James to let him be out of his shortalls for a bit) and back on the carpet, where they seemed struck by a sudden bout of sleepiness. Jacob found himself yawning as well, and before he knew it he was curled up on the floor, eyelids starting to droop and well on his way to a much-needed afternoon nap. The sounds made by his infantilized co-workers suggested that they were settling down for the same, though he only heard two sets of padded underwear poof against the carpet. It wasn&#39;t until just before he was about to slip away that the owner of the third laid down beside him. Rick&#39;s dreamy smile and big bright amber eyes were mere inches away and they made Jacob feel all warm and happy inside - feelings that became much more complicated when Rick, apropos of nothing, leaned forward and kissed Jacob on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ni-ni, Jakey,&quot; Rick said as he yawned and closed his eyes. Jacob could do nothing but gawk at the toddler as he drifted easily into his nap, lips still tingling from what had just happened. It was so quick, nothing more than a peck really, but it was still a kiss on the lips - the kind Jacob had always wished Rick would give him when they had been grown-ups. A million questions buzzed in his confused little head, but the only person who could answer them was sound asleep - and far too adorable for Jacob to even think about waking up. Another yawn came and signaled his losing fight against exhaustion. Eager to surrender for now, Jacob curled up on the carpet, pushed his thumb between his lips, and closed his eyes, eager for whatever awaited him when he awakened.<br />
<br />
<center>***</center><br />
<br />
When Jacob awoke it was to the sound of grown-up voices, ones whose possessors did not immediately come to him as he shook off the haze of sleep. He murmured as he pushed himself into a sitting position, blinking up at the three adults who chatted so amiably at the entrance to the daycare. The younger of the two women who were talking with James held a still-napping Kris in her arms, and it wasn&#39;t until he had studied her for a few seconds that Jacob remembered her as Amy, Kris&#39; girlfriend in a reality past. David, meanwhile, rubbed his eyes and yawned as he held the hand of the older woman, who Jacob was able to more quickly identify as David&#39;s wife, Brenda. The conversation continued for a bit longer before the women made to leave, Amy carrying Kris out while Brenda led her toddling and still pantsless husband through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, kiddo.&quot; James had noticed that Jacob had awakened, striding over to him so that he could kneel before the baby and ruffle his hair. &quot;Have a good nap?&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, all Jacob could do was manage a nod. He followed James&#39; eyes and saw that Rick was starting to stir from his slumber as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we&#39;re just about set to go,&quot; James smiled. &quot;Let me take care of a few things and then we&#39;ll head out, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
At that James left, leaving Jacob alone with Rick just as the baby was pushing himself into a sitting position. Rick smiled at him and Jacob couldn&#39;t help but smile back, feeling his cheeks burn as he played absently with his pudgy little hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wook wike you gotta secwet,&quot; Rick said with a playful grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, ith nothing wike dat,&quot; Jacob peeped. &quot;Ith juth dat, well...you kitht me before ow nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, you don&#39;t wike it when I do dat in fwont of the guys,&quot; Rick chuckled. &quot;But dey did&#39;n see. An&#39; you were so cute dat I hadta kith you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s blush deepened as he struggled to extrapolate the ramifications of what he had just learned. The way he was speaking, it was almost like he and Rick were...a couple. But how could that be? He hadn&#39;t even realized that Rick was gay, though he earnestly prayed every night that that was the case. There must&#39;ve been something about going though a transformation that only three other people had experienced that made secrets like that no longer worth holding on to. And it was Jacob&#39;s guess that he had reacted to the news by asking Rick if they could be together, or maybe it was even Rick who came out by posing that question to him. No matter how it happened, the fact remained that in this reality he and Rick were boyfriends - thumbsucking, diaper-using, two-year-old boyfriends. Jacob snuck a quick pinch of his pudgy thigh to make sure he wasn&#39;t dreaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was dat for?&quot; Rick giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuffin.&quot; Jacob squirmed on his crinkly bottom for a second, suddenly finding it very hard to meet Rick&#39;s eyes. &quot;I was jus&#39; wonderin&#39; if you could kith me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it anytime you want, cutie.&quot; And with that the two of them leaned in for a longer, warmer, softer kiss than any Jacob had ever experienced, one that sent the baby&#39;s heart a flutter and made him tingle from head to toe. He must have had the dumbest, dreamiest expression on his face when the kiss was broken, as Rick took one look at it before he giggled like a loon.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, you lovebirds.&quot; The boys turned to see James standing over and grinning down at them. &quot;What say we head home, hm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick squealed in the affirmative as James swept him and Jacob up off the carpet, carrying a toddler in each arm as they headed out the door. Though Jacob was very much enjoying the sensation of being this close to James again, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder what &quot;home&quot; was in this reality. The fact that he and Rick were being taken out together suggested that it was the same place, which instantly made him grin and made sense given their backgrounds. One of the reasons he and Rick had bonded so well in the last reality was because they had both lost their parents at a young age, meaning that this reality had to conjure up a caretaker for the two of them. His jaw dropped as he shifted in James&#39; grasp to look up at the man carrying them, at the caring, affectionate adult who smiled curiously down at the baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, kiddo? Got a special request for dinner I need to know about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob gaped at him for another moment - before beaming, shaking his head, and cuddling back up against James&#39; chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll wuv anyfing you make.&quot;</p>
