<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All night long the seven teenagers tried to figure a way out of the dollhouse to no avail. Morning came and they were startled by Suzy peering in on them unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that you were able to free yourselves&quot; Suzy said. &quot;We knew that you would be able to. Why else would we super-glue the doors and windows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn us back Suzy!&quot; Jeff demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So bossy aren't we&quot; Suzy said. &quot;Emma's right about you boys. You're just little piss ants, whatever they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you change me!?!&quot; Claire asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're going out with Tony&quot; Suzy said. &quot;I wanted to go out with him. He is so gorgeous, but he wouldn't even look at me with you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't look at you like that because I watched you grow up!&quot; Tony said. &quot;You're like a sister to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's just too bad for you&quot; Suzy said. &quot;I'll be playing with you after school and I expect you to have an... erection wasn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma is warping your mind!&quot; Jeff said. &quot;You know Mom and Dad won't like you saying that stuff, let alone thinking it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What Mom and Dad don't know won't hurt them&quot; Suzy said. &quot;I'm not going to tell them. Now I'm going to go get you some food and water.&quot; She got up off the floor and left.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is our chance&quot; Felix said. &quot;When she opens up the dollhouse we can make a break for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where would we go though?&quot; Eric asked. &quot;In case you haven't noticed we're only a few inches high. Suzy is sure to have her door closed and she'll be able to catch us easily enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to try though&quot; Felix said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to wait until Suzy goes to school&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; Felix said. &quot;I just remembered that an unexplained absence will cause our grades to drop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be part of Emma's plan&quot; Tony said. &quot;But once we get the Chronivac back we'll be able to change it so we were in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can do that?&quot; Felix asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it can&quot; Jack said. &quot;The last time Emma got hold of it she turned us gay. Tony and I kissed in front of the whole school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't remember that&quot; Felix said. &quot;I didn't even hear anything about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't since Transdem Labs fixed things so it didn't happen for everyone but us&quot; Tony said. &quot;We can do the same thing using the Chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this time they heard the bedroom door open and close. In just a few moments Suzy had opened the dollhouse a bit to put a couple slices of apple and water in. Mark and Felix decided to try to make a break for it. Suzy caught them easily just when they made it out. She had them in her hands, lifted them so they where eye level and said &quot;Now that wasn't very smart. You should have realized that I would be ready for you to do that. I was expecting all of you to make a break for it. Now we'll have to punish you two. I think I'll have Emma change you into girls.&quot; She said this last bit with a wicked smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you do it yourself!?!&quot; Felix asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't touch Jeff's laptop for some reason&quot; Suzy said. &quot;I can't even go into his room. Perhaps I should see if Emma can take care of that. But look at the time, I need to get ready for school. Now you just think about what you'll become after school. That goes for the rest of you. Emma and I won't change you any farther if you behave. Oh and just to let you know, Emma changed the plumbing so it actually works now. I don't want to be cleaning out my dollhouse.&quot; She put Felix and Mark back in and latched the front back up.<br />
<br />
The teens sat down and ate the apple and drank some water. It was a quiet breakfast with each of them thinking about the punishment Felix and Mark would be receiving later on that day. They needed to get out of here before then.<br />
<br />
After Suzy left for school the set about trying to find a way to escape. No matter what they tried they couldn't escape. They finally gave up just before Suzy came home from school. It wasn't a surprise to see that Emma had also come. What was a surprise was seeing Suzy Phillips and Heather Watson there. Jeff could tell that Suzy was home later than she usually was. That gave plus the backpack she was<br />
carrying gave him a bad feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we wait for Lisa to show up?&quot; Suzy P. asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should&quot; Emma said. &quot;It will give Felix and Mark some more time to think about their upcoming punishment. I had hoped that Tony would have been one of the ones to try to escape but one St. Martin being punished is as good as the other. They can also explain things to their new house mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Emma said that Suzy smiled a wicked smile and opened the backpack she was carrying. She and Suzy P. reached in pulled out four more doll sized people. They opened the front and placed them inside.<br />
<br />
Jeff, Tony, Jack, and Eric recognized them. They were Louis Anctil, Phil Bridges, Suzy Clifton, and Craig Merriwether. They quickly asked questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to us?&quot; Louis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did we shrink to this size?&quot; Craig asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this a dream?&quot; Suzy C. asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the fuck are we dressed like fags?&quot; Phil asked. It seemed that Emma wanted to humiliate everyone by dressing them like ballet dancers. That may work for Louis, Phil, and Craig but the rest of the guys just shrugged it off. Claire and Suzy were girls so it didn't bother them either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down and I'll explain&quot; Jeff said. &quot;First off, this isn't a dream. We have all been changed by a device called the Chronivac. I received it some time ago. Emma Watson has since gotten her hands on it two other times. Each time she has used it to met out punishment to those that she doesn't like. This is mostly boys. This is just her latest attempt at humiliation. Most boys don't like ballet so she dressed us up like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't mind being dressed up like this&quot; Suzy C. said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She may be planning on making us dance at some point&quot; Tony said. &quot;She had done that to me before she shrunk me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can we change back?&quot; Craig asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get to my laptop and the Chronivac&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the bedroom door opened and Lisa Kilpatrick walked in. She was eleven, the same age as Suzy and in the same grade. &quot;I'm here&quot; she proclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can see that&quot; Emma said. &quot;Are you ready to see what happens to boys who don't respect us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better believe it&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Emma said. &quot;Get Felix and Mark Suzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure&quot; Suzy said with a wicked grin on her face.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to avoid it Felix and Mark walked right into Suzy's hands. This surprised her but she placed them on the bed anyway. Emma typed away on the keyboard and then hit enter.<br />
<br />
Felix and Mark felt the familiar wave pass through their bodies. The first thing to happen to both of them was their dance uniforms vanishing. Felix's hair was the first thing to change on his body. It grew down to his mid back. Next he lost a little height while his body thinned. His waist narrowed while his hips widened. His shoulders became less broad. His Adam's apple shrank. His balls pulled inside him. His hands and feet became dainty. His face reshaped itself becoming more feminine. His chest expanded out into a pair of D size breasts. All of his male body hair pulled back<br />
into his body. He was now mostly female except for his cock which started to shrink. As it shrank his ball sack formed the lips of his pussy. His cock finally shrank down into a clit. Felix was now Felicia.<br />
<br />
While Felix was transforming so was Mark. First his balls pulled up inside of him while his cock shrank to a clit. His ball sack formed the lips of his pussy. His Adam's Apple shrank. What male body hair he had pulled back in his body. His hips widened while his waist narrowed. His hands and feet became dainty. His shoulders became less broad. His face reformed itself becoming more feminine. He shrunk a little bit. His whole body narrowed. His hair grew down to<br />
his shoulders. Finally his chest expanded into a pair of A size breasts. He was now Marci.<br />
<br />
While they were looking at their new bodies their new dance uniforms appeared. They were wearing the same type as Clair and Suzy C. The only difference was their tiaras. Clair's was silver. Suzy C.'s was Gold. Felicia's was Emerald. Marci's was ruby.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is so neat!&quot; Lisa screeched putting down her purse. &quot;When are you going to change them back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma, Suzy, Suzy P., and Heather all burst out laughing. Finally Emma stopped long enough to say &quot;Oh we're not changing them back. They have finally gained their true stature and they will remain that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that isn't right&quot; Lisa said. &quot;They won't learn their lesson if they remain that way will they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care if they learn their lesson or not&quot; Emma said in a dangerous tone. &quot;If you stick up for them then you can join them. What will it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do this then?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they are boys&quot; Emma said. &quot;They deserve what we do to them. Especially Tony St. Martin. He's the worst of the bunch. Thinking he's better than me because he's slightly ahead of me in class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he thinks he's better than you because you're crazy&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just got on my bad side&quot; Emma said darkly. &quot;Grab her and make sure she doesn't make a sound!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather and Suzy P. grabbed Lisa's arms while Suzy covered her mouth with her hand. Emma typed on the keyboard and pressed enter.<br />
<br />
An electric wave ran through Lisa's body and she started to shrink. The other girls let go of her and she fell a few inches. She shrank from her original height of four foot eight to five point six inches, one tenth her original height. After she was done shrinking her clothes, which had shrunk with her, changed. They changed to the same type of ballet uniform that the other doll size girls were wearing. A diamond tiara appeared on her head.<br />
<br />
Suzy bent down and picked up Lisa. She brought her up to eye level and said &quot;Sorry about this Lisa but if you're going to stick up for them then you might as well be them. I'm going to miss our friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does our friendship mean so little to you!?!&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the one who doesn't care about her sisters&quot; Suzy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't waste your breath Suzy&quot; Emma said. &quot;She made her decision. Now put her and the new girls back in the dollhouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzy did as Emma said with some help from Heather. After they were all safely inside and the front once again latched shut a cell phone rang. Suzy went over to Lisa's purse and pulled out her cell phone. She went into the hall to answer it. When she came back she said &quot;That was your mom. I told her that you were on the toilet and couldn't answer your phone. She just wanted to remind you to get to school on time in the morning. It's a good thing that your parents are allowing you to stay here while they're out of town. It makes things simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
They laughed and Suzy shut off Lisa's cell phone and stuck it back in her purse. Then the girls left to do who knows what.<br />
<br />
All the doll size people looked at each other. Felicia then said &quot;I'm sorry about this. I shouldn't have opened my big mouth. I was only trying to help Emma like you guys helped me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok&quot; Tony said. &quot;You were trying to help someone out. You didn't know that Emma was like this. I'm sorry that I yelled at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's alright&quot; Felicia said. &quot;You were understandably upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That didn't give me the right to yell at you&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok people&quot; Phil said. &quot;Why are we just standing here? Let's get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't&quot; Jeff said. &quot;They've made sure that we can't escape. Even if we did Emma is keeping my laptop with her. There's no way we'll be able to get to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They've over-looked a couple of things&quot; Lisa said. &quot;We can escape and return to our normal selves. Though we'll need to do it while they're in school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do we have to wait until tomorrow?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't want to be caught&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are we going to get out and changed back?&quot; Marci asked.</p>
