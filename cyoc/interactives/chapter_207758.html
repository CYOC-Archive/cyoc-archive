<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, Ethan is sleeping deeply, when something happens, the boy’s tailbone starts to wriggle inside of his body. It starts to lengthen and push against the skin right above Ethan’s firm bubble bum, a noticeable nub starts to form, slowly growing longer. Ethan is lying on his back, he groans in discomfort in his sleep, when he feels something poke against the inside of his PJ-pants and the mattress below him. Ethan turns onto his stomach and lets out a sigh of relief when the pressure subsides. The worm-like thing continue to grow, slithering down the boy’s right pant leg, Ethan feels a itching sensation and starts to scratch at his tail, unaware of it as he continues to sleep, while black and brown fur starts to grow out of his skin, covering his Tail. Soon, the tip of a Raccoon Tail pokes out of his pant leg.<br />
<br />
When Ethan awakes the next morning, he at first does not notice the Tail, still groggy and half asleep, the boy wobbles into the servant’s bathroom to get himself ready. ‘Man… I’ll never get used to getting up this early,’ he thinks to himself as he takes off his top, ‘what a crazy dream I had, young Master had a Tail of a Dragon.’ The boy shakes his head as he goes to take off his pants, “as if humans would grow Tails. Haha… what a stupid idea… there is now way that… WHAT THE…,” he shouts when he suddenly feels something fluffy touching his hand, and is it moving? To afraid to turn around and look, Ethan runs a shaky hand along the strange thing, “n-no… it c-can’t be,” he whispers, tears starting to well up in his eyes as he slowly turns his head to look. The boy then lets out a scream, tripping over his pants and landing right on his Tail, which causes Ethan to yelp in pain.<br />
<br />
Desperate Ethan starts to yank at the Tail, trying to get it off of himself, but he soon realizes that it hurts like hell the harder he pulls. The boy also notices, that when ever he thinks about the Tail, it moves and he feels like a switch in his mind turn on and off every time his Tail moves. Ethan is dumbstruck, “s-so… Arthur was r-right,” he mumbles, staring down at his Tail, “it… it is not a dream. D-does this mean… I am turning into an… animal? I… I don’t wanna be a animal,” the boy pulls his legs up to his chest and starts to sob. Ethan then feels his Tail wrap around him, as if giving the small boy a hug, Ethan has to admit, it does feel nice and calming, so unsure of what else to do, he wraps his arms around his Tail and starts to cry into his fur.<br />
<br />
After calming down, Ethan looks at his Tail, slowly a smile appears on his face, “I… I am starting to like it,” he mumbles. He slowly gets to his feet and turns towards the mirror, watching his Tail swishing behind him, “th-this feels so weird,” he says to himself, “b-but I must admit… it d-does look kinda cool and it kinda suits me.” Ethan continues to watch his tail, the more he watches and gets used to it, the more he starts to love it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there is a knock on the door, “ETHAN,” a booming voice is heard, “GET YOUR LAZY ASS UP TO ARTHUR, NOW!”<br />
<br />
Ethan tenses, the fur on his tail standing on edge, “BE R-RIGHT OUT, SIR,” he says. Ethan quickly washes his hair, ‘no time to shower,’ he thinks to himself. He then quickly dresses himself in his outfit, struggling with the pants, trying to hide his Tail in a pant leg. Ethan soon realizes how uncomfortable it is, so he decides to keep it out, terrified of what the other servants, Page Boys and especially his cruel bully of a boss would say or do. Once dressed, Ethan takes a deep breath and steps out of the bathroom, coming face to face with his boss.<br />
<br />
“ABOUT TIME,” the muscular man shouts, “WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? PLAYING WITH YOUR FUCKING TAIL AGAIN?!”<br />
<br />
Ethan blinks, ‘wh-what,’ he thinks to himself, ‘wh-why does he know about my Tail and act as if I always had one?’<br />
<br />
“WELL,” the man shouts, “I’M WAITING! OR DO YOU WANT ME TO HURT YOU?!”<br />
<br />
“I… I was not pl-playing with my t-tail, sir” Ethan says, “I… I couldn’t find my l-lotion.”<br />
<br />
The man growls, “DON’T TELL ME, FREAK,” he shouts, “THAT YOU HAVEN’T WASHED YOUR TAIL?! I REALLY SHOULD FUCKING PUNSH YOU IN THE GUT AND RIP THAT TAIL RIGHT OFF OF YOUR BODY,” he continues to shout. “IF IT WERE FOR ME, YOU’D STILL BE IN THAT FREAK SHOW,” the man shouts, “YOU ARE ONLY HERE BECAUSE OF THE YOUNG PRINCE, WHO SEEMS TO LIKE YOU! A FREAK LIKE YOU DOES NOT BELONG IN A PALACE, FREAKS LIKE YOU SHOULD GET SHOT AND SKINNED!!”<br />
<br />
Now Ethan is really terrified, and he starts to cry, “pl-please, sir,” he says, his Tail between his legs like a dog, “I… pr-promise I’ll clean it l-later and re-remember where I put my lotion.”<br />
<br />
The man clenches his fists, but then he sighs, “FINE,” he bellows, “I’ll let you off this once. But if you ever hold up the business again…,” he threatens, Ethan just nods and gulps. Seeming satisfied, the man “Bruce” nods, “now, get out of my sight,” he says and Ethan makes a run for it, straight to Arthur’s room.<br />
<br />
Ethan arrives at Arthur’s room, without caring to knock, he just rips the door open and slams it shut behind him, then he leans up against the door, and slides down it onto his bum and starts to cry from fear. Unaware to Ethan, Arthur is sitting on his bed, the young Prince only wearing a nightgown.<br />
<br />
Arthur is taken by surprise when the door bursts open and his Page just barges in, slamming the door, falling to the floor and starting to cry. The Prince had planned to tease Ethan about his Tail, but seeing how distraught the young boy seems to be, Arthur simply can’t seem to be able to tease the boy. Arthur instead gets up from his bed and walks over to the crying boy, he reaches out a hand to touch Ethan on the shoulder, but the boy just screams and scurries away on his hands and knees. Arthur would have laughed at this, but something tells him that Ethan has went through a traumatic experience. The Prince thinks about what to do, he decides to try and calm his Page, so he walks over to the corner, in which Ethan had tucked himself, and kneels down in front of the boy, who is lying in the fetal position, his Tail covering his body, in a protective way. Arthur carefully starts to stroke Ethan’s Tail, “hey, Ethan,” he says, calmly, “what happened?”<br />
<br />
When Ethan feels the hand on his Tail, stroking it and the calming voice of his young master, he slowly turns his head to look at Arthur. “I… I’m a fr-freak,” he whimpers, “th-the boss… thr-threatened me. He… he said Freaks like m-me should get sh-shot and sk-skinned. Th-that I should have ne-never been s-saved from… from a c-circus… I n-never was at a c-circus… I only… have the Tail since… this m-morning… wh-what is ha-happening?”<br />
<br />
Hearing this, Arthur is shocked, he knows Bruce, he cannot imagine that that man would be so cruel. Arthur doubts that Ethan would make up such a story, the boy seems to be legitimate terrified, this fills Arthur with anger, ‘no one messes with MY Page,’ he thinks to himself, ‘only I get to do that.’<br />
<br />
Ethan starts to calm down, the stroking causing the boy to feel relaxed, being stroked actually feels really good, that Ethan notices his penis starting to twitch, but he doesn’t say anything. Instead, Ethan looks up at Arthur and asks, “pl-please your highness,” he says, “pl-please tell me wh-what is going on?”<br />
<br />
Arthur thinks for a while, he then smiles and says, “looks like I was right,” he says, “looks like you have grown a Tail, a nice and cute Raccoon Tail.”<br />
<br />
Ethan can’t help but blush a little, “am… am I t-turning into an an-animal,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Arthur shrugs, “I don’t know,” he lies, “I guess it depends, if you enjoy your Tail or follow your animal instincts, the more animal you’ll become, or at least a Raccoon-Human-Hybrid.”<br />
<br />
“And if I d-don’t follow my… in-instincts?”<br />
<br />
Again Arthur shrugs, “I guess you’ll only have a Tail,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t want it,” Ethan says, starting to cry again.<br />
<br />
“Why not,” Arthur asks, “it is really cute.”<br />
<br />
“Be-because Br-Bruce w-will hurt me,” Ethan sobs.<br />
<br />
Arthur shakes his head, “no he won’t,” he says, “leave Bruce to me, I’ll deal with him. No one threatens MY Page,” he says with a smile.<br />
<br />
Ethan looks up at Arthur, he feels somehow protected and safe in his presence, the young boy slowly sits up, hugging his Tail.<br />
<br />
Seeing Ethan hugging his Tail, causes Arthur to chuckle, “I thought you didn’t want a Tail,” he says, “now you are hugging it.”<br />
<br />
Ethan looks at his Tail in his arms, “I… I do like it,” he mumbles, “hu-hugging it is kinda calming.” Ethan then notices something, “y-young master,” he says, “wh-why aren’t you dressed and w-where is your Tail?”<br />
<br />
Arthur grins, “oh, I am able to make my Tail invisible,” he lies, “and as for not being dressed… I thought it is such a beautiful and warm day, that I rather spend my day with my Page than in school.”<br />
<br />
Ethan’s eyes widen, “b-but, sire,” he says, “w-won’t you get into tr-trouble with the school and your parents?”<br />
<br />
Arthur grins, “oh, leave that to me,” he says, “and stop calling me “master”, “your highness” or anything like that.”<br />
<br />
“B-but… how am I supposed to call you?”<br />
<br />
“Simple,” Arthur says, smiling, “call me Arthur.”<br />
<br />
Ethan’s eyes widen once again, “y-you sure,” he asks, “wh-why?”<br />
<br />
“Because I like you,” Arthur says, “you are not only my Page but also my best friend.”<br />
<br />
“Fr-Friends,” Ethan asks, Arthur nods, “b-but I am nothing special.”<br />
<br />
Arthur grins, “you are special to me,” he says, “that is all what counts. Now, stop being so down and let’s enjoy our day together.”<br />
<br />
Ethan can’t help but smile, “wh-what about my duties,” he asks as he gets up from the floor.<br />
<br />
Arthur grins, “as long as you are with me,” he says, “you are free of duties. I am the Prince, remember? So, no one will dare to disturb our fun day.”<br />
<br />
“O-okay,” Ethan says, “s-so what have you pl-planned for today?”<br />
<br />
Arthur grins, “oh, just hanging around, maybe go into town or the park,” he says, “but first, let me make my Tail visible, so that you’re not the only one. Also, give me a minute to call the school and tell them I am sick.”<br />
<br />
Ethan raises an eye brow as he watches Arthur walk to his bed, picking up his phone from his nightstand. “Um… you sure they’ll buy it,” he asks, “what will your parents say when they find out?”<br />
<br />
Arthur has opened the App and is in his file, ‘time to make my Tail permanent,’ he thinks to himself, ‘this time the appearance of my Tail should be instant,’ Arthur confirms the setting and suddenly lets out a loud moan as his Dragon Tail bursts from his body, causing his nightgown to lift, exposing his firm round bum. The young prince gasps, trying to catch his breath, before answering Ethan’s question, “oh, they are to busy to care,” he simply says, already dialing the number from his school, “now shush, while I call in sick.”</p>
