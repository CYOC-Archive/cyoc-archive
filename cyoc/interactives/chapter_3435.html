<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Anyway I just came by to remind you guys about the school dance that
<br />
is about to begin tonight. You guys don’t want to be the only dogs on
<br />
campus without a bitch to dance with!” Steve barks with excitement while
<br />
his tail wags from side to side. “Oh and the theme for tonight’s dance
<br />
is 1920 by the way.” He adds before dropping down to all fours and
<br />
racing down the hallway to his room. “See you dogs there!” Steve howls
<br />
from down the hallway.
<br />
Driven on by the confusion and curiosity that they smell from one
<br />
another, Dale and Mitch slowly pad their way to the entrance of their
<br />
dorm room on their hind legs. Dale’s docked tail bobs along as he
<br />
shuffles his shaggy bulk up to the door first and perks his ears up.
<br />
Mitch closely follows behind him with his feathered tail swinging softly
<br />
from side to side as evidence of his apparent confusion to their
<br />
situation. His ears twitch and he smiles a toothy smile. Mitch pants to
<br />
keep himself calm. Alan, using his tail as a balance as he moves on all
<br />
fours, pads his way to the entrance and squeezes his head in between the
<br />
legs of his two now canine friends. All three of them peer down the
<br />
hallway, cock their heads and twitch their ears in bemusement as they
<br />
watch Steve, fellow student and now Rough-Haired Collie, gets up again
<br />
on two legs near the front door to his dorm room. They watch as he
<br />
reaches up to a dog collar that is hanging around his neck and detaches
<br />
a key from it. He opens up the door to his dorm room with the key and
<br />
then reattaches the key to his dog collar. Steve then walks into his
<br />
room and closes the door behind him. The minute Steve closes his door
<br />
behind him, the threesome try talking to each other about how their
<br />
botched spell affected Steve and maybe the whole entire campus.
<br />
“Wait a minute, guys.” Dale says to his two friends as he holds up both
<br />
of his shaggy paw-like hands to get their attention. “Why are we
<br />
assuming that botched spell of ours has affected the entire campus like
<br />
it did with Steve and us?”
<br />
“How can we not after seeing Steve like that?” Mitch asks him.
<br />
“But how can we make such an assumption after seeing that Steve is in
<br />
the same physical condition as we are? I told you guys a few moments ago
<br />
that the spell wasn’t powerful enough to get past the spell circle that
<br />
Alan had inscribed onto the floor. And even if it did somehow, it
<br />
wouldn’t have gone too far thanks to the other wards that Alan placed
<br />
around the periphery of our dorm room.” Dale tells Mitch as he looks
<br />
down at Alan for support.
<br />
Alan pushes his way through the legs of his two friends, turns around
<br />
and then squats down on his haunches. He looks up at Mitch before
<br />
backing up Dale on his assertion.
<br />
“Dale’s right, Mitch, the wards that I placed around the room as part of
<br />
a class assignment are the same as the ones used in the labs in the
<br />
Arcane Sciences building. And we all know how those wards were designed
<br />
to contain spells that went off accidentally or deliberately wild.” Alan
<br />
comments.
<br />
“Okay, okay, so our botched spell shouldn’t have gone more than a few
<br />
feet beyond the confines of our room. But your comment doesn’t quite
<br />
explain why Steve was affected.” Mitch says to Alan with another of his
<br />
toothy smiles.
<br />
“Steve was probably at our front door and getting ready to come on in
<br />
and tells us about the dance tonight when we were in the middle of that
<br />
surge of wild magic...” Dale starts telling Mitch.
<br />
“...And the wards that I placed around the room were at the weakest at
<br />
the front door where I couldn’t effectively inscribe them into the
<br />
carpet.” Alan says in turn.
<br />
“So here is what happened to Steve. He comes up to our door and gets
<br />
ready to come on in and tell us about the dance. Our spell goes wild and
<br />
it breaches the protective wards of the spell circle as it affects us.
<br />
It then hit the wards surrounding the room where most of it was
<br />
contained and dissipated. But a portion of it came into contact with the
<br />
weakened portion of the ward near the front door and breached it. The
<br />
spell then came into contact with Steve and transformed him like it did
<br />
us. Hence he was the only other person to be affected by our botched
<br />
spell.” Dale says to Mitch with a concluding remark. He smiles and hangs
<br />
his tongue out to pant.
<br />
But his explanation at trying to convince Mitch about what happened to
<br />
Steve falls on slightly deaf ears.
<br />
“Mitch?” Alan asks with a look of worry on his canine face.
<br />
“Earth to Mitch, anyone home?” Asks Dale who is wondering what’s up with
<br />
his friend.
<br />
They both notice that Mitch is looking down at the other end of the
<br />
hallway. His ears are perked up and twitching as he hears something
<br />
coming from behind from one of the close doors at that end of the
<br />
hallway. Alan and Dale cock their heads to one side in puzzlement and
<br />
perk their ears up to hear whatever noise that Mitch is hearing. Mitch
<br />
then looks at Dale and cocks a furry eyebrow.
<br />
“I think you had better think again about who got affected and who
<br />
didn’t get affected by our spell, Dale.” Mitch tells him.
<br />
“Huh?” Dale looks at him questioningly.
<br />
Mitch gets Alan and Dale to look toward one of the doors that is down
<br />
the hallway and on the opposite side. They then hear the sound of a door
<br />
opening up. Ears and furry eyebrows perk up in surprise while tails and
<br />
jaws drop. For down the hallway, they watch as first a huge fawn-colored
<br />
Mastiff and then a slender gray Greyhound wearing dog collars,
<br />
saddlebags and backpacks step out of the room.
<br />
“Oh boy, looks like Steve wasn’t the only one after all to get affected
<br />
by that spell. Looks like Adam and Mario have gone to the dogs too.”
<br />
Alan smiles and comments to no one in particular as his tail sweeps the
<br />
floor behind him.
<br />
Not sure if he is really seeing things, Dale uses his right hand to lift
<br />
up the thick, shaggy mass of fur from his eyes. He peers out from
<br />
underneath his shaggy paw-like hand as all three of them listen to Adam
<br />
brag about his latest girlfriend to his roommate.
<br />
“ I am telling you, Mario, my latest bitchfriend has a great temperament
<br />
toward others and comes from a good breeding stock. And she won some
<br />
best bitch awards from her home town’s canine pageantry last year.” Adam
<br />
boasts to Mario. “How can you say that your bitchfriend is better than
<br />
mine?”
<br />
“I think she is better than yours because of her mixed breed ancestry.”
<br />
Mario explains to Adam.
<br />
Adam and Mario then stop their little discussion about their bitches and
<br />
greet Dale, Alan and Mitch.
<br />
“Hi guys, what’s wagging?” Adam and Mario nearly say to the trio in
<br />
unison.
<br />
Happily wagging their tails and panting contentedly at the sight of the
<br />
trio, they first give Alan who is sitting down on his haunches a
<br />
friendly rub behind his ears. And then they offer him their paw-like
<br />
hands to sniff. Alan surprisingly begins to pant contentedly from their
<br />
gestures of affection and sniffs their hands. Adam and Mario then greet
<br />
Dale and Mitch in turn by coming up to them and hugging them fondly and
<br />
sniffing behind both of their ears. Not wanting to seem out of place,
<br />
they hug and sniff Adam and Mario in turn. Their returning gesture to
<br />
Adam and Mario surprisingly feels good to them and seems to ease the
<br />
tension out of their furry bodies.  Adam and Mario step back from the
<br />
trio and Adam looks at them with a puzzled look to his blackened face.
<br />
“Is something wrong here, guys? You guys smell confused and curious
<br />
about something.” He asks curiously.
<br />
 “No nothing is seriously wrong, Adam.” Mitch says to him with a
<br />
dismissing wave of his paw-like hand. He smiles again another one of his
<br />
toothy smiles.
<br />
“Yeah, nothing is wrong, Adam. It’s just that we were working on a class
<br />
project just a few moments ago and we didn’t quite get the results we
<br />
were looking for.” Dale sheepishly tells Adam and Mario.
<br />
Alan and Mitch nod their heads to show their agreement to what their
<br />
friend said.
<br />
“Which project?” Adam questioningly asks Dale with a raised eyebrow and
<br />
a twitch of his tail.
<br />
Dale looks to his friends for help as he tries to come up with an answer
<br />
that doesn’t sound awkward to his own ears.
<br />
“I am betting that you guys were working on one of Dr. C’s assignments
<br />
from yesterday. Am I right?” He says to Adam as he cocks his
<br />
questioningly and perks up his ears for an answer.
<br />
The trio looks at each other blankly for a second as they try to figure
<br />
out who is this “Dr. C” that Mario is talking about. But then Dale nods
<br />
his head in agreement and tucks his tail between his legs from
<br />
embarrassment.
<br />
“Yeah we were working on one of Dr. C’s assignments from yesterday. And
<br />
we’re just confused as to why it didn’t turn out like we expected it
<br />
to.” Dale again sheepishly says to Adam and Mario.
<br />
Adam and Mario give the trio looks of sympathy. Adam reassuringly pats
<br />
Dale on the shoulder.
<br />
“We understand now about what we were smelling from you guys.” Adam says
<br />
sympathetically to the trio. “Almost everyone here on campus has heard
<br />
about how difficult Dr. C’s assignments can be.”
<br />
Adam and Mario then switch topics with the trio and talk to them about
<br />
the upcoming dance tonight and the latest exams in arcane theory that
<br />
they all had to take recently. And they try to include the trio in the
<br />
little debate they were having before greeting them. A few minutes pass
<br />
by and Adam looks at his wristwatch and motions to Mario that they
<br />
really have to get going. Alan gets up onto his hind legs and stands
<br />
next to Dale and Mitch. They are given another friendly hug and sniff
<br />
from Adam and Mario. And they give them a hug and a sniff in return.
<br />
Tails a-wagging Adam and Mario then leave the trio and walk down the
<br />
hallway. After Adam and Mario leave, the trio quickly pads their way
<br />
back into the deluxe-sized room of theirs. Once inside Mitch closes the
<br />
door behind Dale and Alan and locks it. And then all three of them
<br />
receive quite another surprise from what they see of the ‘living’ room
<br />
of their deluxe-sized room. They stop and stare and pant. Mitch smiles
<br />
again as they see that everything in their living room is just where
<br />
they remembered them to be. But everything in the room has a canine feel
<br />
to it now. In the small pantry area of the living room where they keep
<br />
their snacks and other easily storable foods, they see two large bags of
<br />
Eukanuba dry dog food and some cans of canned dog food of several
<br />
different flavors from Purina. Above the cans and bags of dog food, they
<br />
see a shelf with some flat, plastic dog food dishes on them. And above
<br />
that shelf they see some plastic bottles advertising some brand of
<br />
spring water. They see that the bottles of spring water are resting in
<br />
front of what appears to be human snack food. Some of the furniture
<br />
looks the same. They see that Mitch’s small entertainment center with
<br />
its’ TV, radio, VCR and DVD player are still in the corner next to
<br />
Dale’s small refrigerator cube. But instead of a couch they see several
<br />
different bean bag couches made of some tough-looking yet flexible
<br />
plastic lying all over the room with pillows thrown on them. They see
<br />
dog toys and text books littering the floor next to a wooden chest that
<br />
Alan brought back from home last week. And in the middle of the floor
<br />
they see that the place where they had cast that botched spell is still
<br />
there. But the spell circle looks like it has burnt itself out.
<br />
On the walls they see that some of Alan’s movie posters have changed a
<br />
bit too.  His Lord of the Rings poster now says Lord of the Collars on
<br />
it instead. And it shows a quartet of terriers of different breeds
<br />
standing in front of an Irish Wolfhound wearing woodsman’s garb, a sleek
<br />
looking whippet holding a bow and an arrow with both paws and a really
<br />
shaggy Komondor in wizard’s clothes. At the bottom they see that the
<br />
catch phrase for the movie is now ‘One Collar to collar them all.” His
<br />
Top Dog poster shows a Briard wearing what appears to be a policeman’s
<br />
uniform. Looking at what has happened to their room, Mitch looks at his
<br />
friends with another smile.
<br />
“Guys, I don’t think that we’re in Kansas anymore.” Mitch tells them
<br />
with his tail tucked between his legs.
<br />
Alan rolls his eyes at the catch phrase while Dale shakes in his head
<br />
from bemusement and mirth. The smell of confusion, curiosity and oddly
<br />
enough, happiness, begins to permeate the room. They then walk up to the
<br />
door leading into Mitch’s bedroom and walk inside. Like the living room,
<br />
the changes are very apparent here. His dressers, closet, bookshelves
<br />
and desk are all in the same places as they remember them to be. But
<br />
instead of seeing  his bed positioned next to the window with its’ view
<br />
of the quad, they see a rather huge, plush-looking dog bed resting on
<br />
top of a raised platform. The plush-looking dog bed has a stack of
<br />
pillows and blankets piled on top of it in a neat pile. Mitch walks over
<br />
to his desk and begins to look at his books. He sees that his magic
<br />
books are the same as he remembered them to be. But his science fiction
<br />
and fantasy books now have that ever present canine motif to them. His
<br />
books on werewolves now deal with that legendary creature known only as
<br />
Man. After looking at the books on his desk, he goes over to his
<br />
bookshelf and starts to rifle through his magic books in search for
<br />
answers to their current situation. As Mitch is doing that, Dale
<br />
shuffles past him and spies one of Mitch’s bandannas lying in his
<br />
clothes hamper. He picks it up and uses it as a head wrap to hold his
<br />
shaggy head fur out of his eyes. He joins Alan by the window and looks
<br />
outside. Their ears twitch and their tails wag slowly from side to side
<br />
as they peer out into the quad. Mitch stops briefly in his search and
<br />
looks at Dale.
<br />
“Hey Dale, what’s look like out there in the quad?” He asks him
<br />
questioningly.
<br />
Dale turns his head to the side so that he can look at Mitch and into
<br />
the quad at the same time.
<br />
“Looks almost like a typical day in the quad to me.” He responds.
<br />
“It would look like a typical day in the quad if it wasn’t for the fact
<br />
that everyone out there is a dog like us.” Alan quips in.
<br />
“Everyone?” Mitch asks the two as he sees them wag their tails some more
<br />
and perk their ears.
<br />
“Everyone.” Dale resignedly tells him before looking back outside into
<br />
the quad.
<br />
Alan and Dale watch one pack of dogs taking turns with each other in a
<br />
game of frisbee. At the far end of the quad they see another pack of
<br />
dogs playing a rather good game of flyball. They see dogs walking in and
<br />
out of the quad on all fours and on two legs. And they see that the dogs
<br />
in the quad are wearing the same type of collars that they saw on Adam,
<br />
Mario and Steve. Some of the dogs are wearing either shirts or shorts
<br />
and not much else. Some are wearing nothing more than their backpacks
<br />
and saddlebags. And other canines are just wearing nothing but their fur
<br />
coats. Alan walks away from Dale and the open dorm room window feeling a
<br />
mixed bunch of feelings. He squats down on his knees next to Mitch’s bed
<br />
and spies a tennis ball lying almost under it. He picks it up and begins
<br />
to play with it as he tries to make sense of the moment. He doesn’t know
<br />
what to make of all this. But what he does know is that his impatience
<br />
and desire to be a real dog somehow resulted in their current
<br />
predicament. He juggles the ball between his paw-like hands. He looks at
<br />
Dale and then at Mitch who is still going through his spell books.
<br />
“Do the two of you have any idea now as to what happened to us and
<br />
everyone else on campus?” Alan asks his friends for a reassuring answer.
<br />
“Because I am really at a loss myself as to how the three of us and the
<br />
entire campus went to the dogs.”
<br />
Dale doesn’t answer right away as something in the quad catches his eyes
<br />
and apparently his nose. He sniffs the air coming through the open
<br />
window. He sniffs once and then twice. And then he sniffs deeply before
<br />
gasping and turning his shaggy head away from the window. Mitch and Alan
<br />
look at him and notice that their shaggy roommate is panting rather
<br />
heavily and covering his privates with both paw-like hands. They
<br />
silently get the impression that Dale is blushing under all of that fur.
<br />
Alan gets up off the floor and stands up while still playing with the
<br />
tennis ball.
<br />
“What’s wrong with you, Dale?” Mitch asks questioningly while looking
<br />
his friend up and down.
<br />
“Uh guys just a thought, everyone on campus is a dog right? Just like
<br />
us?” Dale says sheepishly.
<br />
“Yeah everyone on campus is now an anthropomorphic canine like us. So
<br />
what?” Alan tells him while quirking one of his eyebrows up in
<br />
puzzlement. He looks at Mitch and Mitch shrugs.
<br />
“Well if everyone on campus  is an anthropomorphic dog like us, that
<br />
includes the girls from the all girls dorm that is two buildings down
<br />
from our building, right?”
<br />
Mitch and Alan nod their heads and wonder what is the matter with Dale.
<br />
And then before one of them can ask him about what he is getting at with
<br />
this round about questioning, they put two and two together. Barking
<br />
laughter and snickers from both Alan and Mitch fill the room as both of
<br />
them realize that their friend must have caught the scent of one of the
<br />
girls in heat. The girl’s musky scent must have really aroused their
<br />
friend to the point of embarrassment and sexual desire. Still covering
<br />
his privates with both paw-like hands and now tucking his docked tail in
<br />
between his legs, Dale pads away from the window. Alan gives him a
<br />
reassuring rub on the back as he passes him. Mitch smiles and tries to
<br />
collect himself and spare his friend from anymore embarrassment.
<br />
“Well that certainly explains a question that has been on my mind since
<br />
we found out that the botched spell transformed the entire student body
<br />
into anthropomorphic dogs.” Mitch wonders out loud to himself. Alan
<br />
chuckles at his friend’s comment.
<br />
“Oh man, your comment, Mitch, just reminded me of something I read in a
<br />
magazine before all of this happened.” Alan says to Mitch before
<br />
chuckling again.
<br />
“And what would that be?” Dale asks after regaining his composure.
<br />
“Well the magazine article said that when you have a large number of
<br />
girls living together in the same building, their period begins to
<br />
synchronize with one another. So if all of the girls on campus are now
<br />
bitches...” Alan tells them.
<br />
“... then they all would be in heat now!” Says Dale catching on to what
<br />
Alan was just saying. “No wonder that girl I saw just a few moments ago
<br />
was wearing padded shorts and attracting practically every male in the
<br />
quad. Oh boy!”
<br />
Their comments set off another round of barking and woofing as they all
<br />
find themselves amused by the fact the all of the Stonewood girls are in
<br />
heat.
<br />
After a few minutes of laughing and friendly hugging, Mitch goes back to
<br />
looking through his books of magic while Dale and Alan go back to the
<br />
opened window and look outside at the activity in the quad. They chuckle
<br />
a bit and wag their tails as they see that some of the guys in the quad
<br />
have disappeared in pursuit of the bitch that was in heat. But soon
<br />
enough, Dale spots a Scottish Terrier wearing familiar clothing walking
<br />
through the quad.
<br />
“Hey, Alan, isn’t that Professor Dunnel walking through the quad right
<br />
now?” Dale asks him questioningly.
<br />
“Is he coming toward our dorm building, Dale?” Mitch asks him after
<br />
overhearing his question to Alan.
<br />
That question makes Alan let out a yelp and makes him want to hide under
<br />
Mitch’s bed. Dale grabs him by the scruff of his neck. Still holding on
<br />
to a struggling Alan, he looks out the window.
<br />
“Uh, no he isn’t, Mitch. He looks like he is on his way to the
<br />
cafeteria.”
<br />
“Are you sure that he isn’t coming over here?” Alan questions Dale about
<br />
the professor.
<br />
Alan relaxes when Dale directs him toward the window and shows him. He
<br />
sees the professor walking though the quad calmly as can be. He then
<br />
looks away from seeing the professor and the rest of the quad and looks
<br />
at his friends.
<br />
“Guys, any clues as to how this all happened?” He asks them while he
<br />
continues to nervously play with the tennis ball.
<br />
Dale looks at Mitch and the pile of magic books lying across his desk.
<br />
“Didn’t find anything that can explain how we and the entire campus got
<br />
into this mess?”
<br />
“Not a thing, I am afraid.” He says to his shaggy friend. “Let’s sit
<br />
down and go over in our heads about how all of this had happened to us.”
<br />
<br />
He beckons Dale and Alan away from the window and gets them to sit down
<br />
on their haunches in the middle of his bedroom. And he gets them to
<br />
recall the incident that made them and everyone else on campus go
<br />
literally to the dogs. Dale starts the whole thing off by recalling how
<br />
he found the timed version of the Polymorph spell in a seldom used
<br />
portion of the campus library and how he wanted to show his roommates
<br />
the potential recreational use of this particular spell. And the
<br />
discussion goes from there to the point where Alan’s Indian relics got
<br />
accidentally tossed into their already-in-progress spell circle. When
<br />
they get to that point in their discussion, Dale looks at Alan with a
<br />
peeved look in his eyes.
<br />
“Alan, what were you thinking of by introducing new magic to a spell
<br />
that was already-in-progress? Didn’t you remember from Professor
<br />
Lindstrom’s lecture two weeks ago about the dangers of  spell
<br />
corruption?” Dale angrily tells him.
<br />
Alan smells Dale’s anger and reacts submissively towards him by
<br />
flattening his ears and tucking his tail.
<br />
“I didn’t know that the spell that we had cast on one another was
<br />
working.” Alan cringes.
<br />
“Well you would had if you had stayed in the spell circle with the two
<br />
of us instead stomping out of it in your impatience.” Dale barks back at
<br />
him.
<br />
“Back off Dale, nice and slowly.” Mitch says to Dale in a commanding
<br />
voice.
<br />
Dale’s hackles go limp and he takes in a deep breath to calm himself
<br />
down. He smiles meekly at Alan and silently apologizes to his friend.
<br />
Alan’s ears perk up as he picks up on Dale’s scent cues. He reaches over
<br />
and gives Dale a back rub to show him that he has no hard feelings
<br />
toward his outburst. Mitch smiles at the sight before turning to Alan.
<br />
“Alan, can you tell me what was in the Indian bundle that you had
<br />
accidentally tossed into the spell circle? It might help us understand
<br />
just how the original spell got altered.” Mitch asks him inquisitively.
<br />
“Well the bundle of Indian relics that I brought from home during our
<br />
last vacation from the campus contained a clay dog’s head to place our
<br />
minds into the proper mindset while preserving our memories and true
<br />
identities. A piece of leather gang line like the ones used in sled dog
<br />
equipment to establish a pack bond between us. An old coyote leg bone to
<br />
slip us past the restraints put upon the world by the natural laws of
<br />
science. And a tuff of wolf’s hair tied together with some human hair to
<br />
insure that we would have a link between our new existence as canines
<br />
and our former one as humans.” Alan explains to them in detail. “The
<br />
relics together were used by my tribe as part of a skinwalking ritual.”
<br />
What he tells them makes Mitch groan and whine. Dale and Alan look at
<br />
each other in confusion as to what could possibly make their friend
<br />
upset.
<br />
“Um, is something wrong, Mitch?” Alan asks him nervously.
<br />
“Alan, do you remember when you came down with the flu and missed one of
<br />
Professor Dunnel’s lectures?” Mitch asks him calmly.
<br />
“You mean the one we had before we all left for vacation? Yeah I do
<br />
remember missing out on it because of the flu. You allowed me to copy
<br />
your notes afterward.” Alan tells him as he clutches his muzzle and
<br />
tries remembering that day.
<br />
“ Do you remember what the professor’s lecture was all about?”
<br />
His comment gets Alan to think back to the notes that he copied from his
<br />
friend.
<br />
“I seem to recall that the lecture that I missed was on the apparent
<br />
differences between hermetic magic and the natural magic of shamanism.”
<br />
Alan tells Mitch.
<br />
Upon telling Dale and Mitch about what he remembered from his notes, he
<br />
whines and then slaps himself on the head.  Dale looks at Alan
<br />
questioningly.
<br />
“Is there something I am missing here? I never took any of Dunnel‘s
<br />
courses.”
<br />
“Oh man! Of all the stupid, stupid things for me to forget! I was so
<br />
disappointed when that timed Polymorph spell didn’t change us
<br />
immediately into real dogs and so impatient to be a real dog, that I
<br />
forgot that my bundle of Indian relics wouldn’t mix with the magic of
<br />
the spell circle.” Alan says to them in an exasperated whine of
<br />
frustration.
<br />
“And why wouldn’t that bundle of Indian relics work with the spell
<br />
circle?” Dale asks him with an upraised eyebrow.
<br />
“The spell circle is hermetic magic while Alan’s spell bundle was
<br />
composed of shamanistic magic. Those two forms of magic are completely
<br />
incompatible with one another. Professor Dunnel told us in his lecture
<br />
that the two forms of magic have been known to create wild,
<br />
unpredictable surges in the local mana background counts.” Mitch joins
<br />
in and explains to Dale.
<br />
Dale catches onto what Mitch is saying about the dangers of mixing
<br />
magics and creating wild surges. He opens up his mouth in an “O” of
<br />
astonishment before calming down again. Mitch and Alan see him go
<br />
contemplative as he tries to recall something from one of his own magic
<br />
courses.
<br />
“In a wild surge, our original Timed Polymorph spell would have been
<br />
altered in many different ways by the introduction of Alan’s spell
<br />
bundle.” Dale tells them.
<br />
“Indeed it would have been altered. Our spell altered through the
<br />
accidental introduction of shamanistic magic could have empowered it
<br />
just enough to breach your wards, Alan.” He says to the two of them
<br />
before looking at his wristwatch. “And judging by the time on my watch,
<br />
it does look like our original spell has been extended to the point
<br />
where we don’t even know its’ new duration now.”
<br />
Mitch stops briefly to look toward his bedroom window before continuing
<br />
on in his explanation.
<br />
“And considering that our spell has affected everyone on campus, it
<br />
looks like the wild surge enlarged the spell’s range and maximized its’
<br />
effects to consider everyone as an active participant.”
<br />
Mitch’s explanation gnaws itself into Alan and Dale’s minds. They try
<br />
recalling the parameters of the original spell and the effects of a wild
<br />
surge. Alan frowns and looks at Mitch.
<br />
“Wait a minute, Mitch, if you are saying that our spell was empowered,
<br />
extended, enlarged and maximized by the wild surge, then how come the
<br />
spell transformed us and the rest of the student body into
<br />
anthropomorphic canines?
<br />
“Alan’s right, Mitch. If I remember correctly from my notes that even
<br />
though wild magic is unpredictable in its’ effects, it should have
<br />
followed our intent to make us into real dogs. It shouldn’t have done
<br />
what it did with us and the campus. It should have made the entire
<br />
campus go to the dogs literally.” Dale tells Mitch.
<br />
“Here is another puzzling question that has to be answered. How come we
<br />
three appear to be the only ones bothered by our sudden transformation
<br />
into anthropomorphic dogs? We all saw that everyone in the quad and in
<br />
the dorm building was acting perfectly content being what they are now.
<br />
But they shouldn’t be, should they? They should be in the same state
<br />
that we are. They should be trying to find out how they got to be this
<br />
way. They are all acting as if they have always been anthropomorphic
<br />
dogs.” Alan asks both of his friends questioningly.
<br />
“And remember how Steve acted when he came into our room after the
<br />
botched spell went off? He derided us for trying to become something
<br />
that from his point of view doesn’t even exist. He was acting like he
<br />
was never a human being to begin with. What was up with what he said?”
<br />
Says Dale chipping in.
<br />
Dale and Alan’s questions befuddles all of them. Mitch gets up off the
<br />
ground and begins walking around the room with his arms crossed and with
<br />
one hand scratching the underside of his muzzle in thought. Dale and
<br />
Alan follow him around the room with their ears and eyes. They watch him
<br />
ponder about what they said to him. After a few moments he plops himself
<br />
down on the ground next to Alan.
<br />
“Well guys, I can think up at least two possibilities that might clear
<br />
things up for us and help us find a solution to our current problem.”
<br />
Mitch tells his friends.
<br />
“And they are...” Dale asks him.
<br />
“Well the first possibility is that our botched spell did what we were
<br />
just talking about a few minutes ago. Our timed Polymorph spell went
<br />
wild when Alan accidentally tossed in his spell bundle into the spell
<br />
circle. It changed us first but not in the way we were expecting it to.
<br />
Instead of changing us into real dogs for just an hour. It turned us
<br />
into anthropomorphic dogs for apparently an indeterminate length of
<br />
time. The botched spell then came into contact with Alan’s wards and got
<br />
altered again. It breached the wards surrounding our room and proceed to
<br />
transform everyone else on campus into dogs just like us. What makes the
<br />
spell different at this point of the wild surge is that not only did
<br />
physically transform anyone it touched, it also altered their memories
<br />
to the point where they believed they always been this way.” Mitch tells
<br />
them.
<br />
“But why anthromorphs?” Asks Dale.
<br />
“The tied together tuff of wolf hair and human hair in my spell bundle!”
<br />
Explains Alan much to their surprise. “Instead of tying our new canine
<br />
form to our old human forms. It fused together our canine and human
<br />
bodies together and made us into anthromorphs.”
<br />
“But what about our room and the campus, Mitch, how did the spell change
<br />
it to now reflect our new existence as anthropomorphic canines?” Dale
<br />
asks him with a puzzled look to his shaggy face.
<br />
“Remember where we are, Dale. We are living in a place where reality as
<br />
we know it is more malleable than it is on the outside world. Reality
<br />
here can be bent in whatever direction a person or persons perceive it
<br />
to be. There are no normal people around here to reinforce the natural
<br />
laws of existence and set up a paradox to dampen out our magical
<br />
talents.  If a person really puts his mind to something here, his magic
<br />
can make it happen.  Our room and the entire campus didn’t get changed
<br />
by the spell. It got changed by the altered memories of our fellow
<br />
students and teachers. Their new perception of the world around them
<br />
changed reality. As for us, only we remember what reality was like
<br />
before the spell mutated a second time. We may remember what our reality
<br />
was like, but after hearing and seeing Steve, Mario and Adam, our
<br />
subconscious minds must’ve reset our reality to deal with it, thus
<br />
changing our room. In other words our perception of what was wasn’t
<br />
strong enough to counter their perception of what is. So that is why our
<br />
room looks like the way it is. And that is why Steve acted the way he
<br />
did.”
<br />
Dale and Alan try to digest their friend’s hypothesis. It sounds
<br />
farfetched to them but considering what they had seen so far, it sounds
<br />
very plausible to them.
<br />
Okay, I’ll try buying that excuse for what has happened to us, Mitch.
<br />
Even though it sounds hard to believe at all. So what is the second
<br />
possibility for our predicament?” Dale asks him.
<br />
Mitch smiles from embarrassment.
<br />
“Do you guys remember me making that quip about not being in Kansas
<br />
anymore?”
<br />
Dale and Alan let his question sink into them. They look at each other
<br />
and then at him as the nature of his question dawns upon them. Their
<br />
eyes widen at what he is implying.
<br />
“You have got to be kidding us!” Dale says to Mitch in disbelief.</p>
