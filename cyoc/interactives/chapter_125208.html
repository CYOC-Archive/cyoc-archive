<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew Thomas was probably what fitted most people&#39;s mental image of a &#39;frail old man&#39;. He was so skinny, most people would think he was malnourished. But he was as healthy as any man at his age. Healthier, perhaps, since he didn&#39;t have much fat threatening his health. Still, he was far from a spring chicken.<br />
<br />
Like any elderly person, Andrew often thought back to his younger days with longing. He wasn&#39;t a strapping lad back then, but he certainly had a lot more energy than he did now. When Andrew heard about how the Animalian virus could restore youth and improve the body, he found himself often dreaming of joining Animalia. But he was just an old man living out his retirement in Alabama. He didn&#39;t seem to have a prayer of going to Nevada.<br />
<br />
But rather unexpectedly, Effie Wilcox upped and left with an invitation to join Animalia. Even more unexpectedly, she eventually sent back invitations for several of her friends back in Alabama. Some were reluctant to be moving and some couldn&#39;t pack up and leave so quickly. But Andrew was eager to make the trip. He packed up what little he needed and soon hopped a flight to Nevada.<br />
<br />
It was there that Andrew learned the reason for these invitations. Apparently Effie had sort of condition that made her illegible for a special project that turned her into a dinosaur. And the scientists have figured out how to make that option available for other people. Of course, there were other possible dinosaurs to pick now that museums were more willing to part with fossils. It didn&#39;t take Andrew long to pick what dinosaur he would want to be. He had a particular fondness for the sauropods, the great giants that were larger than any other species on Earth. But naturally there would be some limits to what kind of sauropod he could become. The super-long members of the diplodicids were too hazardous to test in this early stage. Eventually, Andrew decided to be spliced with DNA from a <i>Brachiosaurus</i>.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
If Heather and Tyre were any indication, Andrew would need clothes to suit his soon-to-be ginormous size. So Ms. Vivian was asked to spare some time from planning the Halloween party to work on figuring out what to make for Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t really do much if I don&#39;t know how big he is going to get,&quot; said Ms. Vivian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I think we can at least estimate,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;Everything about Andrew is going to be increased in size. His hands, his feet, his arms, his legs, his torso, everything will get much larger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Vivian nodded before adding, &quot;He would also have an enormous <i>schwanstuker</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Stein paused a moment to think it over before shrugging. &quot;That goes without saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof,&quot; muttered Ms. Vivian.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s gonna be very popular,&quot; said one of the lab aides brightly.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
When the specially-tailored virus was ready, Andrew was taken to a waiting room that had a particularly higher ceiling. The <i>Brachiosaurus</i> was one of the most vertical of the sauropods, after all. Other sauropods were built more horizontally. While he knew wearing any clothing would soon be meaningless, he felt too modest to strip down to anything more than a wifebeater and his briefs. He&#39;s had enough shots before to not even wince when he was injected with the two shots. He just hoped the wait would not be long.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t very long at all. Quite soon, Andrew could feel his body heating up. Already, his skin was changing color and texture as grey scales started to spread across his body. The underclothes he was wearing soon got tighter as his body was growing larger and larger. It wasn&#39;t simply size that was changing. The wizened, skinny features he had before were quickly bulking up. His arms in particular were thickening up with muscles, going from bony twigs to large pillars of strength. There was a reason <i>Brachiosaurus</i> meant &#39;arm lizard&#39;. His chest was also expanding massively, quickly shredding apart the wifebeater as his shoulders quadrupled at least in width as every singular muscle became refined and chiseled.<br />
<br />
Andrew felt a rush of heat go into his loins, about the same time that his feet became more elephantine in size and shape, though the toes did grow a few impressive claws for keeping traction. His briefs got tighter as their contents took up extra space. His balls weren&#39;t the cause of it as they were moving to inside his body, even as they grew a lot larger. His cock, previously of no great mention, was becoming harder and larger than ever before in his life. The back was also tearing open because of his growing gluts and the thick tail that was starting to form.<br />
<br />
His neck was stretching out more before his briefs finally snapped. His cock&#39;s length was quickly becoming impressive, being at least a foot in length now. It was also changing shape, becoming redder like modern lizard&#39;s. But it wasn&#39;t just becoming pointy. The girth of his cock was also increasing as the head became flatter even as it came to a partial point. His cock looked a bit like a cross between a lizard&#39;s and an elephant&#39;s, which might have been more to the advantage of a larger herding animal. Andrew didn&#39;t really care about its shape. In fact, his eyes were closed in bliss as his larger hands grasped his rod, though still not holding all of it.<br />
<br />
In the observation room, the scientists were watching as the changes overtook Andrew&#39;s head. What little hair still remaining fell out as the scales covered his scalp. His face pushed out into a snout as his teeth became more adapted for the grinding of plant matter. Though unlike true sauropods, Andrew could chew his food as he still retained some of his human features. His neck was quite long now and seemed to be more flexible by the way he was instinctively bending it. The tail he was growing was stockier than one would expect, but the right size for a <i>Brachiosaurus</i>.<br />
<br />
Of course, some of the finer details of Andrew&#39;s metamorphosis were ignored as most of the scientists, particularly the female ones, were looking at the mighty phallus he was busy pumping. It was growing quite enormous, being easily 2 feet by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies, let&#39;s not get too wrapped up in this,&quot; said Dr. Stein with mild admonishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t...look away...&quot; said Ms. Vivian, almost wishing Arthur had a dick that huge. It would probably hollow her out if Andrew tried to mate with her, but her imagination was still in full-effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come now,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;You know perfectly well that the Animalian virus creates increased arousal in newly-converted subjects. Just because he is particularly...mammoth doesn&#39;t mean you should stare at him like-&quot; Just then, there was a loud moan from the other room and Dr. Stein turned to look just as the observation window was all but painted with white gunk. There were a few squeals from some of the ladies who were watching this. Dr. Stein blinked before saying, &quot;Well...there&#39;s going to be quite a bit of cleaning up today.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Andrew found a lot to enjoy with his new body. He was far larger and muscular than he ever was. His extended neck gave him a height of 12 feet, though he was still pretty tall at the shoulder. He was taller than the giraffes and bigger than the elephants. There was also quite a bit of pride in having the biggest cock, even though there were very few women who could handle his 30 inch monster.<br />
<br />
But there was one woman who was particularly eager to try. Effie Wilcox (now Tyra Wrex) offered him a job at the Meat Market until he could fine a new career for himself. Andrew&#39;s sexy body was pretty much a shoe-in on its own, but Tyra had to try it for herself first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never thought you&#39;d be so eager to do a fling,&quot; said Andrew as he went into Tyra&#39;s bedroom. Heather was out right now, so Tyra didn&#39;t have to worry about making too much noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;A new dose of youth tends to rearrange your interests,&quot; said Tyra in a flirty tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see what you mean,&quot; said Andrew. He had been rather pumped since his transformation, feeling more energetic than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about crossbreeding, I&#39;m on the pill,&quot; said Tyra as she removed her clothes. Standing in the buff, she posed and asked, &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew&#39;s eyes widened as he looked at Tyra&#39;s amazonian body. &quot;I&#39;d say if I knew what I&#39;d find in Animalia, I&#39;d have tried to get in earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, lucky you,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;Now, let&#39;s see that cannon you&#39;re allegedly packing.&quot; Andrew felt a lot more comfortable with removing his underwear this time, allowing his cock to emerge from its sheath. Tyra&#39;s eyes widened as the huge thing came out. &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she said in amazement, &quot;Woof.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you can handle it?&quot; asked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m willing to die trying,&quot; said Tyra, getting on the bed, &quot;Just try not to crush me too much.&quot; Andrew made a seductive growl as he got into position. &quot;Ok, easy there,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;Gently. You&#39;ve almost...oh...oh... <i>Oooohhhh! Sweet mystery of life! At last I&#39;ve found you!</i>&quot;</p>
