<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jory found himself drawn to the chilled wine, one sniff was all he needed to pour himself a cup and down it. He paced the room, exploring his options, figuring out if he could get away, how to get that ring off of Basil&#39;s hand, how to find Amber.. None of it was going to be easy.<br />
<br />
Every time he passed the pitcher he topped off his cup, until the moment it dripped only a sad dribble. With a sigh, Jory drank even that and sat down on the edge of the bed. It was soft, softer than the dungeon was anyway. Falling back, me peered up at the ceiling until he felt himself drifting off.<br />
<br />
Amber waited for him in his dreams, she said his name, but he couldn&#39;t hear it, not his old name. But she stood before him, naked and beautiful. Their bodies intertwined, his lips met hers, soft and moist tasting of her cherry chapstick. His hands slid down her body, tracing her curves, right down to shaggy-furred hips.<br />
<br />
Her strong, firm arms wrapped around him, reaching down to squeeze his ass. He felt her firm, muscular body sliding against his as she went to her knees, a warm mouth enveloping his raging cock. He looked down to see not Amber but Theo servicing him. He put out a hand to push the blond satyr away, but instead grabbed one of his horns, using it to begin thrusting into the satyr&#39;s eager mouth.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the distance he heard a knock on a door, but his dream continued, thrusting eagerly. Another knock and with a deep moan he spilled his seed into the eager satyr&#39;s mouth. A third knock and he woke up. The front of his grey robe was damp with a large cum stain, and as the door to his room swung open he quickly looked around for something to hide it with, but had to settle for hands.<br />
<br />
Theo stood in the doorway, his smirk saying he saw the stain. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;ll happen a lot in the first days.&quot; The blond satyr shut the door behind him and walked over to Jory&#39;s dresser, opening one of the drawers and pulling out a deep blue scrap of cloth.<br />
<br />
&quot;First days?&quot; Jory asked as he watched Theo carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;We satyrs are basically fonts of male virility, it&#39;s a bit much to handle at first, kind of like being a teenager again. Random erections, wet dreams.. You get control of it again, eventually.&quot; Theo turned to Jory. &quot;Take off the robe, it&#39;s time for dinner, gotta get you dressed right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jory sighed and stood up, stripping off the stained robe and tossing it aside onto the bed. He could feel Theo eyeing his slightly overweight body, judging him, measuring him with every glance. He imagined that mouth once more wrapped around his cock, which cause his dick to start to swell back up. Fuck.. he had never thought of another guy like that, but now with Theo in front of him...<br />
<br />
Theo came closer and wrapped his arms around Jory&#39;s waist. He almost went in to kiss those lips but Theo was backing off after a moment, fastening the waist wrap over Jory&#39;s hips, at least giving him some modesty. &quot;There.. looks good on you. C&#39;mon..&quot; Theo headed for the door, simply expecting Jory to follow.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, at least to himself, he did. &quot;You&#39;ve been through this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Theo nodded. &quot;I was human once, too. Got caught, though it was Basil&#39;s father who brought me back here. If you need help coping, I can guide you through some things. Basil, Nico, and Bruto were all born satyrs, so they don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to go through this.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they stepped into the hallway, Jory blinked with confusion. &quot;Wait.. I thought I head Basil say all satyrs are male, how can they..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reproduce?&quot; Theo finished with a grin. &quot;We can breed with almost any female, there&#39;s something like a one in four chance they&#39;ll birth a satyr if we do. Unless it&#39;s an all female species, then it&#39;s more fifty-fifty.. supposedly. It&#39;s why nymphs are the usual breeding partners. Still, it&#39;s sometimes easier just to convert a human.&quot; Theo gave Jory a small smile.<br />
<br />
It was the first time it really sunk home to Jory that he was going to be changed. &quot;When.. when will it start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Already has. The wine carries the spell. It takes a week to complete. Some races go for the change right away, we think that&#39;s a bit traumatic and prefer to ease you into it. Besides, there&#39;s advantages to going slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
They finally arrived in a dining room, with Basil seated at the head of the table. &quot;We&#39;ll talk more later.&quot; Theo winked and went to take a seat at one side of the table, next to one of the burliest guys Jory had ever seen. He knew it was another satyr from the heavy horns and pointed ears, even if he couldn&#39;t see the goat half beneath the table, but the human half was impressive, a solid wall of muscle. His black hair was cropped short and his beard was neatly trimmed. Dark black hair covered his pectorals in curly loops, and his skin was richly tanned to a coppery tone. He looked menacing, until he smiled at Jory. &quot;Ah, the new arrival. I&#39;m Bruto.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to meet you..&quot; Jory said with a bit of shock, moving to one of the seats.<br />
<br />
There was a cough from the head of the table and Basil pointed at the seat at the corner to his right, across from Bruto. &quot;That&#39;s your chair.&quot; Jory moved up the table and took the indicated seat. He didn&#39;t feel the suble fogging that came when the ring was being used to order him around, he just did as he was told without thinking. &quot;You and Bruto will be spending quite a bit of time together. He&#39;s going to teach you how to fight. As my.. factotum, I will also need you to possibly serve as a bodyguard. You&#39;ll be close to me most often afterall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jory looked down at his slightly flabby body, he had spent time getting into shape back home, but it was still a long way off. &quot;I.. don&#39;t think I&#39;m suited too..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not now.&quot; Bruto said with a laugh. &quot;We&#39;ll fix that, this week will be important to that. While your body is in flux it will take in other changes eagerly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jory must have looked confused, because Theo chimed in. &quot;He means that while you&#39;re changing, things will effect you more. Sit around and eat and drink and you&#39;ll put on weight quick. Exercise and work out, and the muscle will stack on quicker than you&#39;ll believe. Only works until your change completes though, so..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;ll be practicing a lot this week.&quot; Bruto finishes. &quot;A few hours every day of working out. It won&#39;t get you to my size, but you&#39;ll be much better. Pity, I like the chubby ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theo laughs. &quot;Well, that would make Nico jealous, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; As if his name summoned him the last of the household staff arrived, carrying a platter laden with food that was set down in the middle of the table. Nico was indeed on the chubbier side, with a bit of a belly, his brown hair and beard were neatly groomed though, and he beamed pleasantly at Jory, then winked at Bruto. Introductions passed around the table once more as Nico served out the meal.<br />
<br />
Conversation quickly turned to business, each person at the table providing a small report to Basil as they all dined. This must be how Basil liked to keep up with things.. over meals. Jory stayed quiet and ate, just listening in and letting it wash over him. He did notice that his cup was filled from a different pitcher than the others. More of the special wine. The meal was delicious and Jory found himself starting to doze off.<br />
<br />
He felt a hand on top of his. &quot;Jory, you can go upstairs and relax, it&#39;s been a long day for you.&quot; He did as Basil suggested, once more without the command, and just as if it was the right thing to do. He found his way back to his room and lay down in his bed. That night Amber appeared again. He made love to her in his dreams, his cock sliding in and out of her pussy as Bruto gripped him from behind, his thick cock penetrating Jory&#39;s ass in perfect rhythm to his own thrusts. Basil looked on from the side, beaming proudly at the threesome taking place in front of him as Theo and Nico took turns servicing the master of the house.</p>
