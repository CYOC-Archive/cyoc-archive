<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a nice and peaceful day at the Transformation Resort.  The seagulls were flying, the wind was calm, the sun is shining, and guests are either entering or exiting the hotel.  Just then a cab was entering the loading area of the hotel as another guest came in to relax so to speak.  The driver got out of the driver seat to get the luggage in the trunk while the passenger got out of the back seat.<br />
<br />
The passenger was a female around the age of thirty who goes by the name of Gloria Cardon.  Her height is 5,7 and a build of a beautiful woman with a bit of an athletic shape and a tannish peach complex on her skin.  Her breasts were that of a double C and looked perfectly rounded underneath her summer tank top.  Her hips and butt were wide and shapely, making her waist a trim hourglass figure.  Her hair was long that it went down her lower back, as the color was that of a shiny black.  Her face was completely pretty and showed both her innocence and sexiness.  To cap it all off, her light blue eyes were bright and sparkling in the sunlight.<br />
<br />
Gloria’s job is an accountant at a huge banking firm where she manages her customer’s assets.  Every summer she gets a week of vacation time to spend in whatever hotel she chooses.  She decided to go to this new hotel because it has the ability to transform anyone into just about anything.  Another reason why she chooses this hotel is because she has a dark secret no one knows about.  She had a transformation fetish.<br />
<br />
Whenever she has a break at work or was at home, Gloria goes on the net and goes on websites such as ARarchive, Transfur, Choose Your Change, writing.com, and other popular sites.  She tends to read stories from Louder, Doc, Merlin, Omnibus, and others to looking at art and sequences done by AkuOreo, Cluedog, tftgar, Mamabliss, Glokens and many more.  Every time she reads a transformation story or look at a sequence, she gets completely turned on and sometimes masturbates in private.  When she heard about this hotel and its transforming properties, it almost felt like a dream come true to be changed into whatever she wants.  Now that dream is coming true right before her eyes.<br />
<br />
While the taxi driver was getting her luggage out, she looked up at the place and smiled in amazement.  “So this is the Transformation Resort.” she said with a confident look on her face.  The hotel itself was completely amazing at first glance.  It’s somewhat similar to Atlantis in the Bahamas but much grander.  There were over a hundred floors that go as high as the Empire State Building and the exterior was painted in a goldish brown color.  There were small statues on each corner of the buildings resembling babies, old people, different animals, and oddly enough she-males.  The entrance to the hotel was also extravagant.  Golden pillars stood proudly with brownish roofs and golden metal arches on top of the pillars showed pictures of people turning into animals, genders, and ages in sequential form.  One arch showed a woman regressing into a baby girl.  Another was a man being turned into a horse.  The third one was a woman turning into a man.  The next one was a man aging to an elder.  The list goes on and on and on.  But in the middle of the entrance was a huge fountain that honors Circe, the goddess of transformation.<br />
<br />
When the Taxi driver gave her the luggage and she paid him, Gloria headed straight towards the entrance to the hotel.  As she was walking, she noticed all the people around the area.  Sure most of them look like men, women, little kids, and old people, but there were others who were Anthro animals, those with different body parts of animals, or full animal forms.  She could tell that the transforming elements in this hotel were real.  And by the way it all looks, she’s going to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
She started to step through the golden gate doors that resembles the entrance to Heaven.  Once she entered the hotel, she was completely and utterly surprised at how it all looks.  The lobby was all Mahogany wood and there was a crystal chandelier hanging in the middle. The lighting was soft and the whole atmosphere was warm and inviting<br />
<br />
A clerk looked up as Gloria approached the front desk and she said &quot;Good afternoon mam and welcome to Transformation Resort. My name is Amy. How may I help you?&quot; She said this with a genuine smile on her face instead of the fake one Sam had seen on so many other hotel clerks.  “Hi there,” Gloria said feeling a little comfortable around here, “my name is Gloria Cardon.  I made a reservation at the hotel a few weeks ago.”  The clerk smiled and responded back, “Of course, let just check the computer to see your confirmation.”<br />
<br />
As the clerk looked through the computer, Gloria decided to ask a question.  “So, this resort…  Is it true that it can transform anyone into whatever they want?”  “Oh yes is does.” the clerk said with a gleeful expression, “This resort has the ability to transform an individual whatever they choose.  And the best part of it is that everyone leaves happy.”  Gloria smiled about that answer and couldn’t wait to try this resort out, once she got her room.  “Here we go…” said the clerk looking at Gloria’s name on the computer.  “Says here you would be staying with us for a week and have unlimited access to any place in the resort.  You might be one lucky woman.”<br />
<br />
The clerk stood up and approach the rack loaded with key cards.  After taking the key and pamphlet, she headed back to the reception and placed it on the desk.  “Here’s your pamphlet about the hotel and the key to your rooms.” said the clerk.  Gloria looked at the three keys and felt completely confused at this.  She looked up at the clerk and asked very awkwardly, “Three keys?  Why do I need three rooms?”  The clerk smiled and answered to the guest, “Each of our guests has three rooms.  One in each of our three wings. This is so you can fully experience what our resort has to offer.”  Now Gloria was impressed.  It’s one thing getting a key from one room, but three rooms in three separate wings, that was unexpected.  ‘Wow…’ she thought, ‘Three wings for me to pick, now that’s interesting.’<br />
<br />
As she thought about it, the clerk went on with her orientation.  “Now, the trolley hub is just down the hall. The trolleys run on a schedule day and night and each trolley goes to the different wing occasionally. There may be a short wait but there are seats in the hub to sit on if you'd like. Here's a map of each of our wings and the timetable for the trolleys. Enjoy your stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria took the hotel key to the rooms and said to the clerk, “Thanks…”  She then left the reception area to reach the trolley station.  As she emerged in the trolley hub she noticed that there were no trolleys present at the time. So she studied the maps and trolley schedules to see where to go.  Once she saw the next train won’t come in the next five minutes, she took a seat on the bench and opened to pamphlet to get the inside of the hotel and its wings.  From what she could understand is that each of the wings show a different transformation and how to activate them.  The Age Wing was to age or regress a person into whatever age he or she wants.  The Animal Wing turns anyone into any animal or inanimate object they choose.  And the Gender Wing can let a person change his or her gender.  Gloria like the wings and couldn’t wait to try them out once she gets to the wings.  But the main question is which wing can she go to?</p>
