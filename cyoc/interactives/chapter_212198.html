<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris looked up at the woman, whose balls he was fondling.  &quot;I hope I&#39;m not keeping you from anything important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, don&#39;t worry about that.  I was on my way to get groceries, but there&#39;s no rush.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris stood up.  &quot;Oh?  Mind if I tag along?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the two went.  As they walked, Chris eyed her backside, noting the Shiba Inu tail wagging behind her.  &quot;Can I hold your tail as we walk?  At its base?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate your politeness, but you don&#39;t have to ask a thing with me.  My body is open to all touching.  I just ask that I can do the same with yours.&quot;  Chris paused only a moment, surprised how open the woman was.  He wondered if everyone was this open to touching.  Deciding to play it safe for now, he reached and held the base of her tail, right above her exposed butt.  And, she did the same with his.  The feeling of someone holding an appendage where he formerly had none, was distracing enough that he almost forgot what he was doing.  But, he rubbed his fingers around the base of her tail, and as he did so, she did the same with his, allowing him to learn how it feels from both sides.<br />
<br />
Along the way to the grocery store, they introduced each other.  The woman&#39;s name was Melanie, she lived alone in an apartment building nearby, and she worked at a greenhouse atop the same building.  In fact, the vegetables grown there were sold at the grocery store they were heading to.<br />
<br />
As she talked, Chris made more changes with the Controller of Reality.  First, inspired by the trip to the grocery store, he gave humans pouches like kangaroos.  These would not be for carrying babies, though, but just for convenience.  Applying the change, he could feel the skin below his belly button open, stretching into a cavity.  Looking over at Melanie, he noticed that she was no longer carrying a purse.  Looking down at her belly, he could clearly see where its contents went, thanks to her wearing a tube top.  He imagined that purse thefts would no longer be a problem, this way.<br />
<br />
Next, inspired by her working in a greenhouse, he gave humankind antlers like a deer.  Except instead of traditional antlers, these would be wooden, sprouting leaves.  Almost immediatley, he felt them sprout out of his skull, adding some weight to his head.  Legging go of Melanie&#39;s tail for a moment, he reached up and felt them.  Brushing his hand across to feel the leaves, he was surprised that his antlers had feeling in their stalks.  In fact, he could feel a light breeze blowing through his leaves.<br />
<br />
As fascinating as these latest changes were, though, these were not the changes he really wanted to make.  With this device, he could make his greatest desire come true, in a way that he could be open about it.  First, he extended the length of a woman&#39;s penis when flaccid.  Looking down at Melanie&#39;s crotch, he could see her penis now flopped on her balls.  Perfect.<br />
<br />
Now for the most important change.  It took a minute to find the option, but find it he did, and just in time, as the grocery store was in sight.  He gave humankind the ability to be absorbed into others&#39; body parts.  Still concious and retaining all their senses, but looking no different than the body part that they became, and under full control of their host.  Both the host and the absorbed can trigger the absorbtion process, but only the absorbed can choose when to be expelled and reformed.<br />
<br />
Apply changes.<br />
<br />
Steps away from the grocery store&#39;s entrance, Chris stopped and took a breath, turning to Melanie.  &quot;Before we go in, can I become your balls, sack and all?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie smiled at Chris.  &quot;I don&#39;t see why not.  Go ahead.&quot;  She reaches down to her crotch, lifting her penis out of the way.<br />
<br />
Chris knelt down and reached for her balls, nervous about what he was about to do, especially in public.  But looking around as people came and went, none of them paid much attention.  Maybe the occasional glance, and one guy smiled at him and gave a thumbs up.  Feeling more comfortable, he touched them, once more.  He was initially uncertain how to trigger the change, but then Melanie triggered it for him.  He felt her ballsack almost liquify, as well as the palms of his hand, as the skin between the two mingled.  Her ballsack then started pulling him in.  Chris wasn&#39;t sure there was a way to undo the absorbtion once it started, but as far as he was concerned, there was no going back, now.<br />
<br />
The process was a quick one, as it only took a few moments before he was shoulder-deep into her crotch.  Then as his neck got sucked in, he felt himself almost fold at his heck, though it didn&#39;t feel painful, but instead had the same wetness as the reast of the transformation.  His vision distorted, as his head was sucked in.  With his vision entering his ballsack, he could see the rest of his body get sucked into his new home.  He noticed that his shirt, socks, and shoes were not sucked in, but instead slipped off his body as it got pulled in, plopping on the ground.<br />
<br />
And then, it was over.  He now looked out from Melanie&#39;s ballsack.  The best way to discribe how he felt was &quot;baggy&quot;.  Within his new form was Melanie&#39;s testacles.  He could feel them.  He could feel his weight, as he hung from Melanie&#39;s crotch.  Suddenly, Melanie dropped her penis, and it flopped onto his &quot;face&quot;, obstructing his view somewhat.  This was what he wanted, though.  At least, kinda.  While it was a woman&#39;s meat that was now laying on him and not a man&#39;s meat, this was everything he could&#39;ve hoped for.  He could even smell the light musk coming from it, and taste it on his hairy skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you enjoy your time as my balls.  I&#39;ll go ahead and keep ahold of your stuff, for you.&quot;  Chris&#39;s view changed, as Melanie knelt down and picked up his things... including the Controller of Reality!  Chris hadn&#39;t considered what might happen to it!  He watched as it was lifted off the ground and out of his view, hopefully put in her pouch for safekeeping.  He considered releasing himself from her balls and getting it back, but he didn&#39;t want the experience to end, so soon.  Hopefully, Melanie doesn&#39;t make use of it.</p>
