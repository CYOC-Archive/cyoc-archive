<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elena decided to call everyone in the lab for an impromptu meeting at the cafeteria. By 9pm, the rest of the lab was infected and everyone present were all anthro herms. She was surprised at the amount of variety. Currently, all infected in the room were mammals, no birds or lizards, though she couldn’t rule out the possibility yet with the current amount of transformed. While some had more muscular builds compared to their slim sexy counterparts, everyone’s breasts were at least DD in size and their cocks were at least 8 inches in length. The unfortunate part was that everyone’s transformations were finished and were now complete anthros, even Jessica, who was now a complete cow herm like Joy. So trying to stealth infect everyone on campus was now out of the question. Luckily, she had an idea in mind.<br />
<br />
“Ok girls.” Elena announced. “While we all are eager to go out and cum all over every human, we’re still scientists. I want to make sure we figure out every detail of this virus so we can figure out how it works. So we need everyone working together to get things ready, because the day shift will be our lucky lab rats. I don’t think I need to explain what the reward for you all is if we get it all set up before 6am.” <br />
<br />
During the whole speech, Elena’s 12 inch horsecock lengthened and hardened with everyone else’s following suit. Everyone’s rods were dripping out pre by the time Elena finished. “Yes ma’am!” They all replied and immediately got to work. The most difficult part came first, cleaning and disinfecting the whole lab as they didn’t want any excess cum or milk to infect the test subjects before proper testing. The herms all had to stay in oversized hazmats that fit their new sexy feminine body’s during this whole operation. The second group had a much more happier time with their job. The janitor, now a muscular tiger herm turned the thermostat in the room to high temperature and all the herm anthros inside began to excessively start collecting their sweat which contained large amounts on their scents. Secondly, they jacked off and milked themselves, putting their fluids in respectively labeled containers. <br />
<br />
After everything was clean and all the samples were collected, everyone gathered in the rooms that they setup for them to stay in while the tests were being performed. The anthros all gathered in groups of two, three or four and began fucking with abandon throughout the remaining time they had before going to sleep for the night. By the end of the orgy, Elena was fast asleep with her lab assistants Joy and Racheal, cocks flaccid and pussies leaking cum.<br />
<br />
At around 6am, the alarms woke the herms up ready for experimentation as the first of the morning crew unlocked the doors and entered, not aware of what was in store for them. The 5 morning scientists were 3 males and 2 females, Mark, Dillan, Clyde, Riley and Alice. They read a note that was left by Elena in the main hallway after they clocked in for the day. “My team determined that we won’t be able to collect enough data on my research in time. I set up samples in the 5 lab rooms. If you all could run some tests before you resume your work, I would greatly appreciate it. -Elena” The five were all confused. Elena was generally good at finishing her quota on time. If she was asking for help, it must be important, so they each went into a different lab to begin work, now caught in the herm’s trap. <br />
<br />
When Mark entered lab 1, everything seemed normal. It was quiet, clean and well organized, very much the opposite of how most of the night crew leaves it. The brown haired man saw the sample located in the cabinet. However, when he opened the doors, Mark was bombarded with the smell of animal musk and sweat, at first it seemed nasty, but it quickly became pleasant to his nose. Mark paused, confused not sure what to do, as if he was in a trance. His cock had hardened and pitched a tent in his pants. What the human didn’t realize was that he now under the trance of an anthro herm’s scent. Elena and the 2 rabbit herms were watching through the monitor room, she then turned on the PR speaker that was set to only be heard in lab 1. “Stand up.” The horse herm commanded. Mark obeyed without hesitation. Elena took turns with the rabbit herms giving Mark commands. He obeyed every single one of them. <br />
<br />
Elena’s hypothesis from what happened with Jessica earlier was correct. Humans that had smelled or inhaled their musk/pheromones become obedient and submissive to anthro herms. After about an hour of Mark just being in there, they observed that no transformations had occurred to his body. The only change was that his penis was hard the whole time while entranced. Elena then issued one last command to Mark and that was to assign the staff to the labs when they clock in to make sure the tests continue. “Yes Mistress” Mark responded and headed to the front desk. “Mistress.” Elena thought to herself. “I like it.”<br />
<br />
Alice did not expect what she saw after closing the lab 2 door behind her. In front of her was a sexy white anthro fox with DD sized breasts and a nice female figure. What surprised her the most was that the fox also had a hard red vulpine cock that appeared to be over 8 inches in long. A goat herm was now on the other side of the lab door to stop Alice in case she tried to resist. “Like what you see?” The fox herm asked. “Come closer.” She commanded. After the shock of seeing the arctic bombshell faded away, Alice quickly opened the door again and turned around only to run face first into the goat herm’s hairy bosom and getting a good whiff of her scent. The pleasant smell filled the human’s mind and her nipples perked up, showing through her shirt. The fox asked her to come to her again and this time Alice obeyed. And sat down next to her and the goat followed suit. They loitered around for an hour, the herms doing their best not to transfer their fluids onto the human. After an hour passed, Alice showed no signs of transformation meaning the first test to see if the transformation part of the virus was airborne was a failure. This also meant the fox had to be closer to the door on the next test since her pheromones didn’t reach Alice in time before she attempted to escape. The fox and goat then ordered Alice to assist Mark in keeping up the illusion that everything was normal.<br />
<br />
Lab 3 was where the experiments got more exciting. As Clyde entered, he saw a small plate of brownies with a note from the chef saying that Elena asked to have them made as an apology. Clyde happily picked up one and took a bite without asking questions. Unknown to the scientist, the brownies were made with the chef’s contaminated breast milk infecting Clyde immediately. He was entranced by the lovely creamy taste and began to quickly scarf down the remaining brownies as his cock hardened. After finishing the last one, Clyde stripped down to reveal his body was already turning feminine as he jacked off. He was in a pure sense of bliss. Breasts began to form and expand to DD cups as his moans became feminine and a pussy formed between her ass and cock. Clyde completely had a women’s body after 10 minutes had passed. The animal features started appearing 5 minutes after as the scientist began to stroke her cock with one hand and fondle her breasts with the other. The anthro herms watching in the monitor room were also masterbating to seeing Clyde change as wool began to cover her body slowly and her feet formed into hooves. After it had been 30 minutes since infection, the scientist still looked like she could get away with being human, it wasn’t until after another 15 minutes passed that her face began to form into a sheep’s muzzle. After it had been an hour since infection, all that was left a sheep anthro herm, and a mess of cum and milk from her masterbating. “What’s your name, sweetie?” One of the herms asked through the speaker after cumming in the monitor room herself. “Claudia.” The sheep replied.<br />
<br />
Riley had quite the rude greeting when she entered lab 4. After closing the door behind her, a grey furred wolf herm jumped out from behind some desks and came all over the human&#39;s face. The virus immediately got to work. Riley’s breasts grew to DD’s and she began to strip naked while also scooping and swallowing the cum that splashed on her. Brown fur was already growing on her body once she was completely naked. Ten minutes had passed since she finished eating all the cum that was left on her and on the floors and walls. By then her fur had formed all the way up to her breasts, a big bushy squirrel tail had grown above her large ass and a nice big squirrel cock and balls had formed above her pussy. She then turned to look for the wolf that sprayed her, but the lupine herm was already gone and the lab doors were locked. After masterbating for the rest of her transformation, she was a complete squirrel anthro herm after being infected for only 30 minutes. It was unknown if getting cummed on sped up the process or if it was because she was already female, but they would find out more after the next set of test subjects arrived.<br />
<br />
Lab 5 was without a doubt the easiest test. The moment Dillan turned the door handle, the Tiger herm that was formally the janitor grabbed him and pulled him inside. There was some brief resistance before the tiger’s scent overpowered the scientist, but after, the herm tore off Dillan’s clothes, had him learn on the desk and then rammed her barbed cock into the scientists now willing asshole. Just like with the other males, the first change was feminization. Dillan’s figure reshaped, DD breasts grew on the chest and a pussy formed between his ass and now hard growing cock. After about ten minutes since infection, white, black striped fur was forming around his, now her, body and her feet was reshaping into hooves. Dillan was now stroking her large 11 inch zebra cock while the tiger kept thrusting into her ass. After about 30 minutes since infection, Dillan, now Daisy, had become a complete anthro zebra herm. This data seemed to show that the current fastest way to transform humans was through direct sex.<br />
<br />
The data already excited Elena. “Bring the new ladies to me.” She commanded the others as she began planning how to transform the rest of the campus and potentially the world.</p>
