<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen thought looking at the she wolves began to crowd around the pack's newest male <br />
one thing on their minds. 'Zack is perfect, the perfect happy medium between myself and <br />
Nick, Nick'll never again bring up a chain of command now that he wouldn't be at the top <br />
of the pecking order..' <br />
<br />
It didn't matter that Pearl and Alexandra hadn't known Zack as a male for more than a <br />
minute or as a person for more than a hour. It didn't matter they hadn't spoken anything <br />
personal to him at all. The smell of him was all it took, for to them to realize they fully and <br />
utterly wanted him inside them, now.  Alexandra and Pearl before being made into she <br />
wolves that morning wouldn't have considered themselves 'easy.'  But Zack's sheer <br />
presence after his transformation felt all inhibitions all just melt away, leaving only the <br />
urge, leaving only the need. <br />
<br />
Alexandra had always considered herself when male proper polite and formal and prided <br />
himself on that, and Pearl as a lady her whole life always thought even in the worst of <br />
situations she could hold her peace and wait her turn. Now the ladies however were <br />
pushing shoulder to shoulder with no intention of letting the other welcoming in Zackery <br />
first!<br />
<br />
Zack meanwhile, feeling the alien yet comfortable urges of his new gender ring through <br />
him, these two female wolves he had been so scared of a moment before, and hadn't even <br />
known about for an hour wanted him, and he was more than ready to give! <br />
<br />
Zack didn't even go for the bed, he simply grabbed the two females and fell to the floor <br />
with them, not even getting a bruise and his giant arms absorbed the impact. There was <br />
plenty of room, nearly everything but the bed the mirror for Alice and a some of Kaylee <br />
and Jensen personal items in the corner had been removed from the room. <br />
<br />
Jack pressed their maternal material against his chest and began to rub them up and down <br />
against it simultaneously, letting go of conscious thought and letting instinct guide his <br />
actions as Pearl and Alexandra felt themselves become more excited and also let <br />
themselves go from rational thinking and let the animal take over. <br />
<br />
The display left Fran and Darla from the massive amount of scent and musk also <br />
beginning to feel warm, and began to lean against their Master. Jensen felt it and enjoyed <br />
the living pillows. <br />
<br />
Kaylee felt like a queen. Now sitting cross-leggged in a chair with a hole in the pack for <br />
her tail (like all the chairs that hadn't been burned or put on sale by the shadows), she was <br />
surrounded by Jennifer's former inner circle. Now in bodies that that were re-colored <br />
copies of hers, the entourage encircled Kaylee without a second thought, bringing her up <br />
to date at everything that had happened at school in the last two days from the girls' side <br />
of things. Hope, a Kaylee with a semi bowl cut and dark chocolate fur also whispered <br />
giggling that up until now Zackery had been a virgin. <br />
<br />
Kaylee inwardly groaned at that, as Kyle he had never understood how getting yourself <br />
knocked up was supposed to be a status symbol, and now as Kaylee, she knew what she <br />
had been missing, but still felt while the sex was fun and an HONOR when given to her by <br />
the master, it didn't create status in of itself... well, maybe the lesser she wolves would <br />
begin to feel that way as Jensen began to sample his now vast collection. <br />
<br />
The sight was also beginning to make Kaylee and her new direct minions charged up as <br />
well. Most of them felt ready to masturbate at the sight before them then and there. <br />
Isabelle was already rubbing her own tail base and letting out a slight moan. <br />
<br />
Zackery explored Alexandra without resistance as his left claws began to help along Pearl's <br />
body, the three beasts moaning with little if any rational thought in their eyes as the <br />
females arched their backs upwards letting Zackery go deeper into them! The whole act <br />
quickly becoming a deep pulsing that radiated out from them to the other wolves in the <br />
room. <br />
<br />
Finally Jensen in one motion grabbed the twins and fell backwards onto the mattress his <br />
manhood inside Darla before they had even bounced. <br />
<br />
Kaylee however still sat back and watched this time, her paws doing down between her <br />
legs, as she whispered to the three new she wolves around her, &quot;Go ahead and join in, <br />
nothing to be ashamed of. It's not like we're human anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace asked, sounding surprised, &quot;H-have sex with Master or Zelphy I mean Zackery? I'm <br />
not so ....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all right, he's not Jennifer anymore, and he's not Zylphia anymore... go right ahead...&quot; <br />
Kaylee said in a calm pushing along voice. <br />
<br />
The three wolves went along with their leaders prodding and Grace went over to Jesen now <br />
without hesitation or reserves while Iesbella and Hope dropping on top of Zackery.  Kaylee <br />
loved seeing the girls who had taunted her as Kyle going at it like the animals they all <br />
were. The fact she had done precisely the same with Jensen was lost on her. Kaylee <br />
pleased herself as the display before degenerated into a full orgy and she rubbed against <br />
between her legs harder, smiling in her chair. Zackery bit into Alexandra's shoulders and <br />
his claws went into Peal's rear and the two she wolves howled, soon followed by the <br />
others. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
A silver/gray she wolf put the wire into place, her hands covered in tiny electrical burn. <br />
While a pastel green she wolf her hands wet and covered in bit of rust and tiny cut using <br />
only her own super human strength rearranged the piping the walls had been covering up.            <br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy,&quot; June moaned twisting another wire. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know already.&quot; Megan replied reconnecting the pipes and shouting downstairs to turn <br />
back on the water flow, very happy when there no leaks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We don't even have all the tools we need for this!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have even LESS tools to work with than I should have so don't complain! It's crazy <br />
enough that we're doing this at the same time. We're playing with being electrocuted!&quot; <br />
<br />
June sighed. The deadline kept getting pushed closer. And their numbers were spread thin <br />
as a million things all seemed needing doing at once! But they pressed on, they had to, <br />
Master desired it.  <br />
<br />
June said, &quot;If we had some more time we could just go downtown, find some day workers, <br />
lure them back here, turn them into pack members, and we'd have plenty of hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Time we don't have sadly to get them oriented and I'd rather not work with people who <br />
don't know my language.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Granted.&quot; June said just barely avoiding getting another electric shock. At leas the burn <br />
marks didn't show up that badly against her fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that going to be good enough that when we seal this all in we're not going to set the <br />
house on fire when someone throws a light switch?&quot; Megan asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, will your job be good enough that the house won't flood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has to be...&quot; Megan only said in reply, the rust looking rather ugly against her fur color. <br />
It made it look moldy. <br />
<br />
They heard the howling a minute later. Followed by more howling, echoing through out <br />
the manor. <br />
<br />
Both she wolves felt a wave of envy go through them, &quot;Master is enjoying himself.&quot; June <br />
stated the obvious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it's with Alexandra and Pearl?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can ask them later.&quot; June said... &quot;If we get a later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough already just focus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Master.&quot; In the study Martha's heads sighed, wishing it was her but knew it would <br />
never be her. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're REALLY playing the saxophone.&quot; Said Marcy. <br />
<br />
Kevin just nodded. <br />
<br />
Alice didn't look up from her poetry book, Bart and Jenny merely looked at each other with <br />
annoyance hoping the she-wolves got their message about sound proofing the pup's <br />
personal rooms. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
A man and a woman, both just under forty-six percent buck and a doe, hugged each <br />
other as they heard the wolves howling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry dear,&quot; Jack said in a lower voice than before as Marcine continued to huddle <br />
close to him. &quot;Remember the wolves promised we wouldn't be harmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know dear I know... should we enjoy  each other in our last night as mostly human?&quot; She <br />
asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Dad always said, only have sex with a girl if you've married her... I don't think he was <br />
talkin' about deer though... as long we're still somewhat human let's stick to what makes <br />
us human... we'll have plenty of time fer the rest laterrrr.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marcine nodded, going along with Jack almost by instinct. &quot;Dear, as soon as they're done <br />
remaking the house, let's go down stairs... I don't want us to be caught up here when <br />
we're almost done.&quot; Already their joints were retrofitting, and Jack's antlers were plain to <br />
see and with three points and a lot more coming... <br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good idea dear.&quot; Jack agreed. &quot;Until then though.&quot; Jack fumbled with the TV <br />
remote, and turned on the TV, they channel flipped for a minute before happening on the <br />
Disney channel... which happened to be showing Bambi, they two leaned against each <br />
other and enjoyed the film. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
An hour later, seven she wolves and two males laid in an exhausted fumbled intermixed <br />
heap that covered the bed and floor. Jesen was tired. Something in Zackery told him he <br />
could go for more, but the mass of tired she wolves around him had a docile effect on him <br />
inspiring him to just lay there.  Kaylee meanwhile, got up from her chair and stepped over <br />
and around the other sleeping oversized beasts and relatively gently pushed away <br />
exhausted Fran and laid herself on to of Jensen. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm all ready my dear... I trust you have enough left in you for one more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... maybe we should introduce Zackery and... and the others to the rest of the pack <br />
first...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do that in the morning dear, when they've all finished up the house for your <br />
inspection... &quot; Kaylee leaned down and whispered, already rubbing her already wet spot <br />
against Jensen, &quot;Isn't that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're to be submissive...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am submissive Master, I am submissive to your desires, and I know you desire me... now <br />
my Big Bad Wolf... once more... for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon low howling echoed through the house again. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope we get some soon...&quot; Said the Cream furred Anne as she laid down some new floor <br />
boards with the plain green Beatrice. <br />
<br />
The dark blue Caroline behind them hammered the boards into place, &quot;We're ALL gonna <br />
just be glade to have some sleep by the time we're done, now hurry up, the sooner we've <br />
got everything done the sooner we can rest.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right acting fore-wolf.&quot; Beatrice sighed while Anne whined a little, the idea of bed was <br />
indeed becoming nicer. But Master had spoken and Master was to be obeyed. <br />
<br />
The shadows worked themselves like robots, but as per their original Dare to not ignore <br />
bodily needs, they found one of the bed rooms that hadn't been demolished for the wolves <br />
den and undressed in total silence of each other, effectively ignoring each other totally, <br />
not even glancing at each other's naked bodies. The changing long haired shadows not <br />
even glancing down at their changing bodies as they laid down in the two beds not trying <br />
to not touch each other and not trying to touch each other and were quickly in dreamless <br />
sleep. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;TIme for bed.&quot; Martha's two heads said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not tired!&quot; Kevin said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I said time for bed.&quot; Martha repeated both her heads and all six of her eyes on Kevin. <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny looked at each other and nodded, Marcy only yawned. Alice stayed silent as <br />
she put down her book. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come along now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Martha.&quot; All of the pups said together as they each took a hand or a tail. <br />
<br />
Martha opened the door, and the heads looked in different directions and shouted, &quot;Make <br />
way! Make way for Master's scion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie was pulled out of the way before Martha accidently trampled her by Maxine and <br />
Robyn. Megan stepped out of the way nearly falls over to the first floor from the banister <br />
but held her balance.<br />
<br />
Martha led the pups through the working and mostly tired she wolves like Moses did the <br />
Israelites though the red sea arriving at the promised land soon enough. <br />
<br />
They found Jasmine inside doing some finishing touches on the walls and shoed the sea <br />
green she-wolf out. Martha made sure all the pups were on the bed as she turned out the <br />
lights. She noticed Alice. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should get to bed Mistress Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel tired in this world Miss Martha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then Mistress Alice sleep in the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice curtsied, &quot;As you wish Miss Alice.&quot; Alice climbed into what had been Jennifer's vanity <br />
mirror and climbed into the reflection of the bed, the reflections of the pups being like <br />
ghosts to her. Alice did her best to sleep, the noise of the construction echoing from all <br />
the house's mirrors inside her world. <br />
<br />
Martha meanwhile found a chair and sat down outside the room, one of her head was soon <br />
fast asleep while the other scanned the hallway endlessly watching the she wolves carry on <br />
their weary task. <br />
<br />
Caroline began to go from room to room, spot checking everything and collecting she-<br />
wolves to focus on other tasks as the effect snowballed as the construction's speed began <br />
to pick up as minor tasks were at last completed and major ones began to be focused on <br />
more and more. Ironically it was Caroline who fell asleep on her paws first, she caught by <br />
an attentive lavender Sarah who laid her down on a mattress as the she-wolves worked <br />
relentless on their sacred task until it was fully complete. <br />
<br />
Ulysses fell asleep next. Sarah wasn't sure where to put him weather in the cub's room or <br />
the male's new den but decided not to cross Martha on the Omega's one piece of authority <br />
and deposited the sleeping boy in the male's den. &quot;Have sweet dreams kiddo.&quot; Sarah said <br />
kissing him on the forehead the best a wolf could and left him to it. <br />
<br />
By the time the last final piece of spackle had been put in place and evened out, half of the <br />
remaining wolves had fallen asleep were their lay.  Megan and Roger had fallen asleep on <br />
top of each other as the siblings had worked (much to their alarm and disgust come <br />
morning in spite of zero actually happening). Nick fell asleep after saying he was just <br />
resting his eyes, and entered several wet dreams. <br />
<br />
Well past midnight (anywhere from one to three AM, they had stopped keeping track) and <br />
no other noise in the house the wolf with the red ribbon in one ear turned towards her <br />
one surviving work mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ashley... &quot; Nicole said seeing everything on Caroline's list check off after being given <br />
it after Sarah then Megan had nodded off, &quot;I think we're done? Ashley?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two tone blue she wolf was sleeping against a wall her eyes closed and her breathing <br />
steady.  Nicole figured she'd get up and lie down next to Nick as a joke and tell him all the <br />
stuff he wouldn't remember having done... yes... in a minute... after she rested her eyes....</p>
