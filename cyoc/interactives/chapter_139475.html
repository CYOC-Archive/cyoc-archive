<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An alarm went off, reminding Rayne Koh that it was time for her to head out of the comfort of her bedroom and its plethora of electronic delights. The chubby, short-haired college freshman lesbian sighed, not wanting to do but she&#39;d made a promise to her online girlfriend, and she intended to keep.<br />
<br />
Slipping into a well worn pair of sweat pants, the &#39;gaymer&#39; girl also grabbed her favorite &#39;Penultimate Illusion&#39; t-shirt, the long running JPRG series she&#39;d been playing for most of her life. She&#39;d beaten every game in the franchise at least twice, along with the &#39;Fantastic Galaxy&#39; games and the &#39;Wyvern Journey&#39; series. Lately, she&#39;d finally gotten into some of the online versions, and that&#39;s how she&#39;d met her best gal, Cassie.<br />
<br />
Both of them had despised the way the online community had expected &#39;gamer girls&#39; to be. So what if they weren&#39;t some skank on a stream playing &#39;HighGuard&#39; or    &#39;DayBase&#39;?  They played games, therefore they were gamers. <br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Rayne prepared to step outside of her dorm room. Her roommate was nowhere to be seen, which neant she was in class somewhere. In the hallway, she barely managed yo avoid  a pack of pledges from the BAE sorority, and slipped out the building.<br />
<br />
The walk to the local food mart took her off campus. She&#39;d have preferred to grab something from the cafeteria, but Cassie had insisted she get fresh food and fresh air, so Rayne trudged onwards. It didn&#39;t take nearly as long as she expected to get to the store and gather the things on her list. One trip to the register later and she was on her way back home.<br />
<br />
Rayne had been enjoying her trip outside for food and ostensibly exercise. The day was nice, and the sun did feel good on her skin. But then her phone rang, and one look at the caller ID spoiled the moment.<br />
<br />
Her thumb pressed the call button, even as she sighed wearily. <br />
<br />
“You still playin’ that pansy shit dyke?”<br />
<br />
She frowned at her cousin&#39;s insult but held her tongue from responding in kind. He was still family after all, and she didn&#39;t need him stirring up drama with her parents, who were barely accepting of her sexuality at the moment. But, she was unaware he&#39;d just passed the &#39;were breeder&#39; curse along to her<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you that shooters are not my thing, Raiden. What do you want?&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter? Can&#39;t take a little prank between cousins?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ha. Ha. But seriously, what are you bugging me about?&quot;<br />
&quot;HighGuard is offering a free weekend pass for noobs, so I sent you a link. Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
He hung up before Rayne could tell him she wasn&#39;t interested. A notification popped up a moment later, telling her that she had an invite to join the hottest multi-player shooter out there. Another sigh escaped her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden...you idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annoyed now, the freshman lesbian decided to take a peek at her favorite model on the &#39;Gram, needing something to distract herself. Clicking on the app, she was pleased to see it opened up right on Jae Bang&#39;s page. She allowed herself a grin as she oogled a bikini shot of the hot Asian model. But that moment of carnal pleasure was her doom as the &#39;were breeder&#39; curse Raiden had passed onto her was now triggered.<br />
<br />
The changes started with her feet. The ratty sneakers began coming apart at the seams, reforming into a trendy pair of sandals that did nothing to conceal her now petite feet as the red polish splashed over her toenails.  This alteration caused her overall posture to shift, as her back straightened out and she walked taller.<br />
<br />
Following the path of changes up her legs, her sweatpants began turning blue as loose cotton became tight denim. The forming jeans accentuated her growing curves, as her thighs and calves swelled thicker with toned muscles. As the back pockets formed, her ass pressed outwards, the rounding cheeks straining the material.<br />
<br />
Unconsciously at that moment, Rayne&#39;s hand clicked away from the &#39;Gram and opened up that invite Raiden had sent her...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
On a popular video streaming service, a new account called &#39;AlphaGrrrl&#39; logged itself on. In monents, videos began uploading themselves, showing someone playing multiple rounds of &#39;HighGuard&#39;, utterly &quot;pwning&quot; noobs. <br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Now the transformation reached Rayne&#39;s torso. Her fave t-shirt was the first to feel its effects, as the forest green was being consumed by a wave of grey. The colorful almost chibi fantasy characters that graced the front were growing and shifting forms. Swords and staffs became rifles and pistols. Armor grew bulkier and more modern. Finally, the anime faces became hardened soldiers&#39;. The &#39;Penultimate Illusion&#39; logo broke apart and became the one associated with the number one shooter on the market, &#39;Roar of Combat: Guerilla Tactics&#39;<br />
<br />
Of course, the new shirt hung a bit awkward on her, but soon other changes made it the perfect fit. The  bulge of her belly was sucked back in, leaving behind a smooth and toned surface. The excess fat flowed into her breasts, causing a surge forward that pulled the shooter&#39;s logo tight. There was also a popping from her spine as it adjusted her posture even more to emphasize her bust and butt.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
Back on the &#39;AlphaGrrl&#39; account, a flood of &#39;Roar of Combat: Guerilla Tactics&#39; videos were unleashed. The growing subscriber count hit new highs, as the audience loved watching this sexy gamer trounce everyone who challenged her.<br />
=====<br />
<br />
As the transformation moved down her arms, Rayne realized she was walking away from her dorm. Her hands grew thinner, and gained great dexterity, even as her memory was growing hazy. <br />
<br />
&quot;D..D..Dorm? But aren&#39;t I staying  with...?&quot;<br />
<br />
An image of her internet crush, Jae  Bang, came up, but the attraction was replaced by something more... sisterly in nature. In fact, the very idea of being attracted to women seemed alien to her. But what about Cas...who? She shook her head and continued to walk<br />
<br />
As her fingernails grew long and coated with dark red polish, Rayne&#39;s fingers were already flicking at the screen of her changing smartphone, as it became a higher end model of the kind that retro movie star Caitlyn Whittemore promoted. The rings that looped around several of her fingers glittered gold.<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
For &#39;AlphaGrrrl&#39;, things seemed to getting even better as she earned an endorsement deal from one of the big smartphone companies. Pretty soon, other offers were coming in and her videos were filled with various recommended products.<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
As her new path took her to an apartment building on the nice side of town, Rayne was starting to get lost in the swamp of new memories filling her head. Her knowledge of JRPG&#39;s faded, as her skills at shooters and more action oriented fame grew and grew.  Also growing was a desire for men, especially the cute ones she crushed online.<br />
<br />
The changes now reached her head. Her short greasy dark hair pulled itself downwards, flowing freely as it grew past her shoulders. It lighten a little, as brown highlights could be seen among its now silky texture. <br />
<br />
Perfect bangs swept into place as her face shifted from nerd to chic. Her skin smoothed out, as her cheekbones rose up. Lips grew plumper with red lipstick glistening on them. Her wide nose scrunched smaller. Eyebrows arched upwards.<br />
<br />
She pulled off her glasses, the lens now black as they became stylish sunglasses. The bag of groceries in her other had long ago shifted into the purse she carried her phone and other items in. Dropping her shades inside, the attractive woman pulled out a set of keys as she entered the building. The catcall whistle brought a bright and wide smile to her face.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, in the apartment of &#39;Gram model Jae Bang, a new room was forming. There was a bed and a large closet filled with sexy gamer related clothes. But more importantly, it had a top-end gaming computer with all of the accessories needed to stream games live (courtesy of Gerald). On its walls, pictures of its occupant meeting with her fans appeared.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
A new video was now playing on the &#39;AlphaGrrrl&#39; channel. The woman on screen had a headset that was positioned in a way that didn&#39;t hide her sexy features. She was talking directly to the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, losers! It&#39;s time to git pwn&#39;d by Regina &#39;AlphaGrrl&#39; Bang. But first some shout outs! To my sis Jae, congrats on hitting 40 mil on da &#39;Gram. And to my gurl Erika Erotika for stopping by for dat sweet crossover vid.  Just tell that hunksicle DariusShooter, I&#39;m gunning for his title next!&quot;<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
And another Koh fell to the curse and joined the ranks of the Straightubers...</p>
