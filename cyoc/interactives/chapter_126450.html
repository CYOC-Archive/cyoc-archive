<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Tad, Amy, and her brothers boarded their bus to head to school that morning, a pair of triangular ears slowly twitched back and forth. Some of it was involuntary, as if the owner had been having a nice dream, but a part of it was also responding to the soft noises that had been heard earlier while Tad got up, showered, dressed, had breakfast, and then went out the door. It was soon enough that Claire slowly blinked her eyes and looked over to Jen&#39;s black furred head and body. That made her smile.<br />
<br />
They had had a wonderful time the night before and Claire felt herself adjusting quite well. There was, of course some of the personal adjustments that Claire knew would be the result of becoming what she&#39;d dreamed of since learning about weres. There had been the obvious surprise that weres were not only real but most of the people in Moon Lake were a were-beast of some kind and to a certain degree there was the obvious shock/surprise at the fact that she would need to become one, but Claire had been fairly fine with that and had been quite eager for it. The big issue that had been in relation to &quot;adjustment&quot; had actually related to the sexuality of the were she&#39;d wanted to be...<br />
<br />
She&#39;d always loved cats and seeing Samantha Twist turn into a werecat when she first moved to Moon Lake had made her very interested in joining them. However, the fact that werecats were all at least bisexual, if not outright lesbians had been enough to complicate things. It wasn&#39;t something that really mattered to Claire, but most werecats that she&#39;d talked to had either refused outright for that reason or tried to turn her toward the various feline based weres that either had both males and females like the wereleopards, weretigers, werelions, and werecougars, or to those mono-gendered weres, like the werecheetahs that weren&#39;t strictly homosexual. But Claire&#39;s preference had always been for house cats and to her it didn&#39;t matter what would happen to her sexuality.<br />
<br />
And as she looked to Jen&#39;s face, also in her were form, Claire couldn&#39;t help but feel happy. Jen had been the first to be willing to go through with the transformation, and while she knew she was a lesbian now, Claire was quite happy and grateful to Jen. It might mean more adjusting to both her sexuality and her present size, but she was glad for it and glad that Jen had given her that opportunity. It became even deeper as Claire actually felt something more than just her new sexual attraction to Jen. It felt more like Jen could be something more, likely due to her gratitude for Jen actually going through with transforming her.<br />
<br />
And Claire couldn&#39;t help but smile as Jen&#39;s eyes fluttered and then opened to reveal the green werecat irises with a vertical slit pupil. Jen gave a yawn shortly after and soon realized that Claire was looking directly to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Claire said softly as she looked into Jen&#39;s eyes, happily lost in them, &quot;I had a great time last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen managed a smile in return as she looked back at Claire. While she really wasn&#39;t at a point to truly say she would be ready for marriage again, as there were some things and questions that she had that related to fully overcoming Jeff&#39;s murder, but she did have to admit that there was something special about Claire that felt like more than just someone who&#39;d wanted to be a werecat. Maybe it was the fact that Claire had been straight before their first meeting and yet wanted to be a werecat, regardless of the fact that doing so would change her sexuality. Maybe it was the honesty that Claire had actually asked her out with and the coupled with the fact that she didn&#39;t try to force anything when she mentioned that she was still getting over Jeff&#39;s murder. Regardless, there was something special about the Japanese Bobtail based werecat that really made Jen happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you did,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;and hopefully... there was plenty you learned last night... as the woods around Moon Lake will always be open to you... and a LOT of weres often enjoy being able to go out in the fur and enjoy the night. Sometimes its hunting... sometimes its just adventure...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen then reached forward found Claire&#39;s hand, taking it softly in her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes it&#39;s a bit of fun,&quot; Jen finished with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we had a LOT of fun,&quot; Claire answered remembering the sexual activity the two of them had engaged in after walking through the woods for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;That we did,&quot; Jen answered with a return smile and looked over toward Claire for a few moments. The silence that followed lasted briefly but was ended when Claire came up with a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; Claire asked softly before giving a yawn of her own.<br />
<br />
Jen rolled and looked over the to the nightstand behind her and while she had to squint for a moment, it was more due to the fact that she&#39;d just got up and not because the light was rather low in her bedroom. The small bedside clock quickly came into focus and she could read the illuminated red numbers.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about seven forty five,&quot; Jen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!?&quot; came Claire&#39;s reply, sounding a bit more panicked and her ears perked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven forty five,&quot; Jen answered again, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s answer was Claire practically jumping out of bed and resuming human form. Jen could hear her whispering &quot;oh shit&quot; over and over. It puzzled her greatly and she hoped it wasn&#39;t anything she&#39;d said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m late for work,&quot; Claire answered, &quot;I have a job as a custodian at the college... not the most glamorous job, but it pays the bills and I&#39;ve always had a knack for fixing things... but I work the day shift and it normally starts at SIX!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear... I...&quot; Jen didn&#39;t know how to answer things from there. She knew she had her fair share of real world things &quot;to do&quot; as well, but for the moment with no calls for interviews, yet, she could only wait on the applications she&#39;d sent in. On some level it could mean that she was free to sleep in if she really wanted to, as Tad was old enough to know how to take care of himself, though that would last only so long. Once she had a job again, she&#39;d probably have to dedicate time to maintaining a regular schedule. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... this is my fault...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it isn&#39;t,&quot; Claire answered, &quot;It slipped my mind last night and I should have let you know before we went out or remembered while there was time to make it home on time rather than just collapsing here because I was so sleepy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen slowly got out of bed and looked to Claire and realized that with the time that it was, Claire was nearly two hours late for her job, and while the college would likely forgive her if this was a first time offense, she didn&#39;t want to take the risk of Claire having to rush into her date clothes, run home, change into work clothes, and then run to the college. It&#39;d only make her later than she already was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some jeans, tennis shoes, and a shirt you can wear,&quot; Jen offered, &quot;You wear them and go straight to the college. We&#39;ll handle getting things sorted out later. I can even wash your date clothes for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d loan me your clothes?&quot; Claire asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both werecats,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;and while our exact measurements aren&#39;t going to be exactly the same... my things will be close enough that you&#39;ll feel more comfortable in them than in the clothing you normally have... And besides, if you&#39;re already late, there is no need to force you into anything that would keep you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Claire gave a smile while Jen fished out the clothing she&#39;d offered for Claire to wear.<br />
<br />
From there, there was a bit of hectic activity to get the day going. Claire got into the spare clothes that Jen had available to share. They didn&#39;t fit her perfectly, but she did have to admit that they fit her a bit better than her normal clothes did. She knew she&#39;d need to get some things of her own that would fit her, but that would have to wait until after her shift ended. Beyond that, about all Claire could get for breakfast was a pair of pop tarts that Jen had put in the toaster before heading out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to put you through all this in the morning,&quot; Claire said to Jen as they reached the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Jen managed after a brief moment, &quot;it might help while waiting for calls concerning potential job interviews as well. I can&#39;t answer them if I&#39;m asleep, now can I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire managed a small chuckle but couldn&#39;t get much more than that. The weekend had been wonderful. She finally got to be a werecat and the one that turned her was someone worth dating and being able to cement that relationship was important. But it wasn&#39;t something that just meant that the world would stop around them. She still had her job... for the moment... and she had to do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try to get your things back to you when I can,&quot; Claire spoke as she began to walk down the sidewalk that went from the Decker&#39;s front door to the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your time,&quot; Jen urged, &quot;and let your boss know it was my fault you&#39;re late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire gave a half nodded and was soon on her way, jogging up the street with the intent of making it to the college. Jen watched her go for a few moments and then shut the door before moving to start her day.</p>
