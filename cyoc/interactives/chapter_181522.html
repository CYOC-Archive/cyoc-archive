<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the Chronivac changed reality it also changed her parent&#39;s fate when they were trying for their first kid, and during the night they were trying to conceive their kid for the first time her mother&#39;s womb tingled as her eggs were compromised. Then her father&#39;s sperm got all weak not even able to get to the location of the compromised eggs. Their daughter&#39;s consciousness was safe since it was in a chair in the future, but when they went to a doctor to get their fertility checked out they were filled with sorrow. They had been really gotten excited over having their own kid, and had started saving... prepping... coming up with some names. They decided to look for more options, and while having their own kid through a donor may have been somewhat possible... If they were going that far they&#39;d be better off adopting. They found a pregnant teen who didn&#39;t want to have an abortion and adopted the child. The only condition was the boy have his mother&#39;s maiden name as his middle name.<br />
<br />
George Stone Walter grew into a fine young man, and on his 16th birthday his parents felt he was emotionally mature enough to be told he was adopted. He was mature enough to not ask a million questions or something. He was merely told he was adopted and that if he wanted to meet his biological mother they could help set up a meetup. He just wasn&#39;t sure what he was going to do. He just went to his room to digest the new information. As he got to his computer he had left on he took a seat on his nice chair and then noticed a program that was unfamiliar to him. He glanced at the chronivac and it was currently listing a chair... and for some reason it was named Elizabeth... <br />
George looked down to his chair and asked &quot;Did mom name you?&quot; Then went back to the computer as obviously a chair couldn&#39;t talk. George looked through the program a bit and pressed the scan button, and saw his profile. There was his name, age, gender, etc. He saw family took a look and there it was in this program as well. In the top right corner there was a notification &quot;Profile 2 has been fully saved.&quot; That made George curious as he found the profile pages and saw Profile 1. He looked at it and saw the name Elizabeth Walter. He looked to the chair and said &quot;guess mom wanted a girl to call Elizabeth ey Elizabeth?&quot; the stat window would let him scroll through more, but there was a button called &quot;Apply&quot; and since this was just a profile he hadn&#39;t changed he was curious what applying whatever would do. Little did he know he was the target. <br />
Reality around him started to warp a bit as his parents became fertile again, but a change more noticeable to him was his shorts and shirt changing to a trendy dress. There was also a tightening at his crotch and chest as his boxers turned to panties and an unfilled bra. He then noticed his arms becoming more slender and hairless as his whole body became more slender. Then he felt a weight growing on his chest as he looked down to see a massive pair of breasts jutting out. The more fun ride of the transformation for him was when his vision lowered as his shrunk shorter, and then as his ass inflated a bit his vision level went back up a little. George breathed in and out as his changes slowed. Concerned George groped her breasts sensing the warm squishy masses were firmly attached to her, grabbed her large firm ass, and then patted her crotch. George was trying to figure out what was going on not knowing that Elizabeth under him felt a little miffed this random guy was feeling up her body like this. <br />
George got up from his seat and yelled &quot;Mom, did you do something to my computer?!?&quot;<br />
Her mom said &quot;No Elizabeth, I haven&#39;t gone in there in forever.&quot;<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
&quot;No Buts little Miss! I didn&#39;t give birth to you so you could yell at me like that. Nor did I raise you to raise your voice like this!&quot;<br />
&quot;But didn&#39;t you adopt-&quot;<br />
&quot;Where did you get that idea?!? Do I need to bring out the tapes of me pregnant with you again? For some reason your dad filmed me giving birth to you if big belly me isn&#39;t enough proof!&quot; <br />
&quot;...umm... right... sorry...&quot;<br />
&quot;Sweetie are you ok? Do you want to talk about something?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just I.. George well... um...&quot; George was trying to think of how to phrase his explanation of the chronivac then her mom&#39;s eye&#39;s lit for a second<br />
&quot;Having some boy trouble? We going to meet this George at some point?&quot; Did he not exist? George thought... But Elizabeth mom thought he was Elizabeth... and this program that could change him and reality around him... and that Chair named Elizabeth... <br />
&quot;Ahahah... em... Well I think I&#39;m just a little overwhelmed today. I&#39;m going to go rest a bit, sorry for yelling mommy.&quot; <br />
&quot;...Well... have a good rest then.  I&#39;ll still be here if you want to talk about this later.&quot;<br />
George nodded and headed back into her room. Then went back to her computer as she moved the chair away not interested in sitting on some potential pervert. George&#39;s mind was racing a mile a minute thinking about what he was going to do as his reality seemed to just swirl around him in a somewhat incomprehendable mess</p>
