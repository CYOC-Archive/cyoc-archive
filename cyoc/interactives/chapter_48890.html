<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer couldn't help but read a little of the book before throwing <br />
it into her backpack. It was open to the part where the big bad wolf <br />
meets little red ridinghood for the first time.<br />
<br />
Jennifer scoffed and threw the book into her bag, &quot;Any stupid wolf <br />
that can get killed by a dumb woodcutter isn't that scary, if I was <br />
the wolf there's no way I would have gone down so easily...&quot; she <br />
muttered under her breath.<br />
<br />
Without another thought she picked up the backpack and headed to the <br />
kitchen to grab something to eat, the bus would be coming to pick her <br />
up for school soon.<br />
<br />
Tossing the backpack on the table she began to rummage through the <br />
fridge, but nothing really caught her eye despite the fact her stomach <br />
was rumbling. In fact, she thought to herself, she was feeling a <br />
little woozy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd better sit down for a minute,&quot; she thought to herself and plopped <br />
down in a chair.<br />
<br />
Jennifer's vision began to spin as she sat in the chair, her wooziness <br />
becoming full on dizziness and nausea. She clutched at her stomach as <br />
it churned, her whole body feeling hot and sticky with sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must be coming down with something,&quot; she thought as she sat in the <br />
kitchen holding her head in her hands, trying to keep the room from <br />
spinning.<br />
<br />
Slowly the heat built in her body, sweat ran down her face in a <br />
torrent as she tried to get a hold of herself. Something was <br />
definitely wrong now.<br />
<br />
She stood up and tried to make her way over to the telephone, not sure <br />
who she was going to call but desperate to get some help. But, as she <br />
reached out with her hand for the headset she gasped as she caught <br />
sight of her arm. Thick hairs were beginning to push out of her <br />
forearm as she watched. With a gasp she realized it wasn't just her <br />
arm that was growing the hairs, but the backs of her hands had <br />
developed a thick layer of black fuzz as well.<br />
<br />
The phone forgotten, Jennifer tried to make her way to the bathroom. <br />
She had to see what was going on in her body!<br />
<br />
As she walked the heat began to fade from her body only to be replaced <br />
with a strange stretching feeling. Jennifer began to feel as if she <br />
was being pulled apart from the inside, pushing and growing in strange <br />
and unnatural ways. Her clothes began to feel tight and restrictive, <br />
like they were too sizes too small.<br />
<br />
Just as she made it to the bathroom the first of many loud <br />
'Riiiiiiiiip's sounded from the back of her shirt, eliminating any <br />
idea that Jennifer had that this was just a 'feeling'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; She cried as she spotted herself in the mirror for the <br />
first time, &quot;What the FUCK is happening to me?!!!&quot; Jennifer's body was <br />
pulsing and stretching upward and outward. Thick muscle could be seen <br />
covering every inch of her body and thick hair was crawling down from <br />
her shoulders to cover her torso even as more grew up from her pants. <br />
It felt to her like thousands of tiny ants were crawling all over <br />
underneath her skin as her body transformed.<br />
<br />
More rips sounded from her clothes as they began to tear away from her <br />
thickly muscled frame. Jennifer let out a low moan as the changes <br />
swept down her legs and past her groin. She couldn't help but run a <br />
meaty hand over her snatch as the fur enveloped it. It felt so smooth <br />
and warm down there... &quot;No!&quot; She jerked her eyes open again, &quot;What the <br />
fuck is going on?!&quot; She was bombarded by strange feelings, desires, as <br />
she changed. New hormones and chemicals flooding her system.<br />
<br />
She pulled her hand away from her dripping sex, long black claws now <br />
adorning her fingers instead of cherry-painted nails. It was the hand <br />
of a monster!<br />
<br />
Her breath was coming fast now, almost like she was panting and she'd <br />
grown to almost 9 feet tall, her head brushing the ceiling of her <br />
bathroom. She was almost entirely covered in black fur now, her <br />
muscles defining new and alien curves and bumps that she'd never known <br />
before. With each movement they heaved and jerked, bulging with a <br />
strength she'd never known before.<br />
<br />
Finally she was beginning to figure it out, she'd read the book! The <br />
big bad wolf! &quot;But wait,&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;I thought the wolf <br />
in the story was a.... male wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes went wide as she snapped back to looking into the mirror, <br />
barely noticing the muzzle pushing out of her face as she realized the <br />
changes were far from done.<br />
<br />
Jennifer's breasts had nearly disappeared, swallowed by huge sculpted <br />
pectorals. Even as she watched they became harder and harder to <br />
distinguish. Again her hand, now almost more a paw, wandered down to <br />
her privates. She gasped as it brushed along, not her familiar <br />
opening, but a thick sheath stretching up from her groin.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted then as her legs cracked and changed. <br />
Her ankles were growing upward as she was forced to stand on the balls <br />
of her new wolf-like feet, causing her to naturally fall into a dog-<br />
like crouch.<br />
<br />
She let out a low whine, almost a whimper, as she looked at her face <br />
again. Her hair had all but disappeared, leaving only a thick mane <br />
running down her still human-like face into her wolfish body. But that <br />
was all about to change as she watched her muzzle continued to push <br />
out from her face. Teeth clattered to the floor as new sharper fangs <br />
pushed their way out of her gums. The fur flowed down from the top of <br />
her head as her ears shifted upward, growing into tall wolf ears that <br />
swiveled immediately back to lie flat on her head in a sign of fear.<br />
<br />
As the fur swallowed the last of her human features Jennifer noticed <br />
her eyes had taken on a deep amber color, eclipsing her old baby-<br />
blues.<br />
<br />
Finally the changes began to fade away and Jennifer stood there in <br />
front of the mirror: A hugely muscled, powerful, and very male <br />
werewolf.</p>
