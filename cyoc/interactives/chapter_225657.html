<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the afterglow from your jerk off session, you’re able to think more clearly and now realize you have to start cleaning up your mess. Your thick lion cum had covered a lot of the bathroom and you didn’t want your roommate to see it when he came back from his job.<br />
<br />
“But how am I supposed to clean such a mess?” you wonder, “Maybe my ripped clothes could act as a rag?”<br />
<br />
Trying to find a use for your shredded clothing you reach down to grab a piece of your shirt only to find nothing on the ground. Well there was still a bit of your pre-cum and semen left on the floor but your ripped outfit is no where to be seen.<br />
<br />
“That’s odd,” you think, “Where did my clothes go?” <br />
<br />
You had just saw them when you were masturbating and even remembered shreds of your clothes being littered over the bathroom floor after they ripped apart. But now? Nothing.<br />
<br />
You get back up and leave the bathroom before taking a right to go to your bedroom. You probably had a spare towel you could use to wipe up the mess and if not that there was some dirty laundry you could use.<br />
<br />
Swinging your door open, you turn the lights on and find yourself shocked at what you find.<br />
<br />
Your room was completely different! Yet… exactly the same.<br />
<br />
You bedroom still looked the same but the sizes of certain items had readjusted. Your bed had expanded tenfold and was now much bigger than you remember. With a strong metal bed base instead of your old flimsy wooden one. Likewise the chair at your desk had changed, now a Chesterfield chair rather than your small swivel chair.<br />
<br />
The room also feels slightly smaller but that was only safe to assume from a shift in perspective thanks to your increase in height.<br />
<br />
Bewildered at the small changes in your room, you question a robbery before recalling that robbers steal your belongings not replace them. You stroke your chin as you try to come up with a logical solution before being interrupted by a knock.<br />
<br />
“Hey! I forgot my key. Could you open the door?”<br />
<br />
Fuck! It was your roommate. Now you were screwed. How would he react to seeing you like this? It probably wouldn’t be a pleasant reaction. After all, who expected a giant lion man in their apartment instead of their human roommate.<br />
<br />
What were you going to do?<br />
<br />
You hear the doorknob rattle as he tries to open the door. Giving up, he begins to pound on the door.<br />
<br />
“Give me a minute. I’m putting some clothes on,” you yell, the pounding stopping.<br />
<br />
Noticing he’s stop, you head to your closet to get some clothes. It would probably help in greeting your roommate if you weren’t nude. A naked lion was way worse than a clothed one.<br />
<br />
You reach in and take out some of your clothes. Maybe they would still fit? However, to your surprise, you find that your clothes have adjusted to become much larger and wider, now able to fit your body perfectly.<br />
<br />
You quickly just put on some sweatpants and a tanktop, going commando, as you try to take the least time possible. Frank wasn’t very patient and you knew that sooner or later he would begin to aggressively knock on the door again.<br />
<br />
The clothes hug your impressive frame in a nice way, showing off your muscular physique while remaining comfortable. Looking at your bedroom mirror, you admire yourself, feeling a slight sense of pride from your new body. There’s a slight twitch from your cock as you get lost in your admiration, flexing your muscles in the mirror.<br />
<br />
The pounding begins again as you turn from your mirror, annoyed. “Alright, Alright. I’m coming.” you say irritated. You were getting a bit tired of Frank’s forceful knocks.<br />
<br />
Leaving you room you try to remember what you were thinking about before looking at your reflection. You were thinking about something revolving around your roommate. What was it?<br />
<br />
You unlock the front door and swing it it open before realizing your mistake.<br />
<br />
“It’s about time! Max what took you so long?” Frank says as he looks up to see you.<br />
<br />
“Uh… wait! I can explain!” you spout, preparing for your roommates incoming freak out. But it never comes. Frank simply drops his keys and wallet on the coffee table before walking to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Man I’m starving. Did you make something to eat?” He asks and opens the fridge, beginning to rummage through it. Finding nothing he closes the fridge in disappointment and looks back to find you still frozen and holding the door open. “Hello? Max?” He calls, but you don’t respond. <br />
<br />
Still shocked at the absence of Frank’s appalled reaction, your mind is drawn into a blank as you try to make sense of it. You clearly looked different now. Hell, you weren’t even human anymore, so why was Frank acting so calm about all this?<br />
<br />
“Earth to Max?” <br />
<br />
A hand wave in your face startles you back from your thoughts as you blink your eyes and shake your head.<br />
<br />
“Is there something wrong? Why’re you acting so weird?” Frank asks and looks at you with a befuddled expression.<br />
<br />
“I-I-I mean… you’re not shocked at this?” you ask him and gesture toward your whole body.<br />
<br />
“What? Your clothes? What are they supposed to be? Gucci or something?” He responds and looks at your outfit then shrugs his shoulders. “I don’t really care about clothes that much to be honest.”<br />
<br />
“But! But! I’m a Lion!” you exclaim before bracing yourself, worried about your sudden revelation.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I know.” He looks confused. “I mean you don’t look like a tiger or cheetah to me. And you’re obviously a lion so what’s the big deal?”<br />
<br />
“But don’t you remember? I used to be human!” You tell him with a slight edge of fear in your voice, you were beginning to become terrified at what was transpiring.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about? You’ve always been a lion.” He states nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
His words fill you with shock. You instantly rush back to your bedroom and grab your phone. Unlocking your phone with Face ID, you don’t notice that your face had easily being recognized, as you open your photos.<br />
<br />
It was true.<br />
<br />
Hundreds of the same pictures of you with family and friends are now replaced with your lion self in each one. Your room, Frank’s words, and your photos all point to one thing: Reality had adjusted to your new body.<br />
<br />
Everyone knew you were an anthro lion and have always remembered you as one.</p>
