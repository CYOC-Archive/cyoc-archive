<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casey and his friend, James, sped headlong down the last hill to his house, the two ten-year-old boys standing upright on their bikes as the early Spring air blasted in their face, happy school was finally finished for the week and they could finally get down to snacks and video games. The sun was higher now than it’d been all winter, the smell of pollen and life fresh twitching against Casey’s nose as greenery grew all around them. But suddenly something foul started to sizzle in the boy’s nostrils.<br />
<br />
“Euwgh…” Casey gagged, skidding his bike to a stop outside the driveway instead of using the momentum of the hill to ride it up to his house like usual. James stopped shortly in front of him, wondering about the sudden deviation from their Friday routine.<br />
<br />
“…What?” James asked, turning his bike before parking it next to Casey, watching his friend rub his nose as if it were broken. “Something wrong?”<br />
<br />
“Are you serious?” Casey shot a frustrated stare to James. “Can you seriously not smell it? It stinks so bad!”<br />
<br />
“What? What are you talking about?” James looked around, looking for a garbage can or a skunk or anything that Casey could possibly be referring to. He turned back to his friend with a peeved look. “Look, I didn’t shower after gym today. Is that it, huh?”<br />
<br />
Casey shook his head and stepped off his bike, throwing his backpack off leaving all his bags strewn out in a pile on the driveway. “No, not you!” The ten-year-old snapped back, keeping his fingers on his nose as he set off into the backyard behind his house.<br />
<br />
“It’s been going on this whole week…” Casey grumbled, leading James on until he was able to pinpoint the source of the stink. “There, right there!” The boy pointed accusingly at the bottom of the screen door in the back of his house.<br />
<br />
“Dude… I don’t smell anything…” James shook his head, kneeling down, getting closer and closer to where Casey was pointing until… “Oh! Oh God – yeah, okay, that reeks!”<br />
<br />
Upon closer inspection, speckles of yellow liquid dotted the lattice of the screen door, a puddle of urine wetting the soil just underneath it. It was really pungent, the heady smell clawing into the boys’ nostrils, screaming that musky aroma right into their brains. James stood up, fanning the gross scent away from his nose, turning back to Casey. “You can seriously smell that from your driveway?”<br />
<br />
Casey nodded, “Y-yeah. I’ve been smelling this stuff for a couple of days now! Something keeps peeing in my backyard every time I leave the house and it just smells so strong! I try to wash it off with a hose but that hardly works… plus it just come back to piss around here again!”<br />
<br />
James folded his arms and pushed up his glasses, ready to give an opinion from a certified boy scout. “Well – it smells pretty strong – stronger than just a dog or a cat. I bet it’s a fox.” The boy nodded, agreeing with his own commentary as he looked back down at the little stream of acrid piss seeping down the frame of the back door. “Foxes like to piss on stuff to mark their territory or attract mates – maybe you’ve got a secret admirer, huh?” James giggled, nudging Casey in the arm.<br />
<br />
“Well, how do I tell it to fuck off?” Casey grumbled nasally, holding his nose shut for dear life.<br />
<br />
“Foxes hate the smell of humans.” James explained, shifting back to an explanatory tone. “I heard from a scout master that if you’re a boy, all you gotta do is fight fire with fire and that’ll scare them off!”<br />
<br />
“You mean…” Casey’s head shot towards James, wondering if he was serious.<br />
<br />
“Yep, stand back.” James said as he pushed his friend behind him, unzipping the fly of his jeans before letting a trickle of urine loose, aiming it right where the fox had marked.<br />
<br />
Casey turned his head away, surprised James would just go and do this so casually, but it seemed to sorta do the trick. It smelled like the fox’s acrid piss was getting diluted, doused in a stream of the other boy’s urine. The smell no longer burned quite as hard in Casey’s nostrils, and the boy was finally able to unplug his nose, letting out a sigh of relief. “Thanks, dude.”<br />
<br />
“It’s what I do!” James chuckled, shaking off a few droplets of piss before zipping back up. “Now let’s play some video games! Your mom’s bought pizza rolls, right?”<br />
<br />
“Mhm!” Casey smiled, leading the other boy back to the driveway to get their things, only for something to cloy against his nose yet again… this time ten times worse!<br />
<br />
“Ewewewew!” Casey mewed as he plugged his nostrils once again, but this time to little avail. The air was humid with the smell of fresh piss, the taste of fox urine staining his tastebuds as the two approached their bikes and backpacks they set on the driveway.<br />
<br />
James’ stuff looked untouched, but Casey could only wish the same could be said for his things. It looked like his bike had been left out in the rain, a puddle of yellow liquid oozing from underneath his bike – the calling card of that damned fox that was tormenting him! Not only that, but his backpack was also dragged along the concrete, the fabric stained with astringent flecks of fox pee as the bag’s contents lay all over the place. Loose leaf sheets of papers scattered in the wind, Casey’s homework blowing away across the yard as his textbooks were strewn this way and that. Casey’s gym clothes were carried the farthest away, his shoes and socks deposited on the grass while his gym shorts and shirt were crumpled up in a heap next to a bush, stained with more of that vulpine urine. Then, hidden underneath the foliage he found the thing that hurt him most.<br />
<br />
“My… my lucky underwear…” Casey cried out, the boy almost shaken to tears as he found his special pair of tighty-whiteys absolutely drenched in the fox’s juices. He fished it out from underneath the bush, watching piss drip off the fabric, Casey coming closer than ever to gagging, just barely stopping himself.<br />
<br />
“Dude, just leave it! Throw it out!” James slapped it out of Casey’s hands, only for the boy to pick it up again. “It’s ruined!”<br />
<br />
“No!” Casey shot back, “I wear these to every test I take at school! They’re lucky! And don’t you remember that home run I hit during little league last year that won us the sem-finals? Well, I was wearing these!”<br />
<br />
James took a few steps back, rubbing the back of his neck as he realized the reverence his friend had for that strip of white cloth. “Okay, fine. You can try to save it, but you’re on your own for this one.” James, sighed, fishing out a plastic bag from his belongings. “Just put it in here, don’t let it drip all over the place!”<br />
____________________________<br />
<br />
The cleanup took only a few minutes, the two boys hastily scrubbing Casey’s bikes clean as the sun started to hang low in the sky. A fun night of videogames and pizza was out of the cards tonight as Casey’s mood had been soured for understandable reasons, plus he had to work overtime to save his precious lucky underwear.<br />
<br />
“Good luck.” James called, waving off as Casey zipped his shorts back up, the little boy having just got done peeing on his own bike to ensure the fox would never try to mark it again. James undid the kickstand on his bike, motioning one more time to him “Just… don’t feel too bad if you gotta throw those away, alright? You can find a new lucky pair of underwear, you know.”<br />
<br />
“These are special…” Casey sighed, holding the plastic bag in his fingers as he began walking inside his house. “I can clean them. I know I can. I’ll think of something.”<br />
<br />
And with that, James sped down the street back home, leaving Casey to contemplate how to save that pair of underwear so his mom wouldn’t force him to throw them away.<br />
<br />
Casey plopped the plastic bag in a sink in the bathroom, taking extra precautions before daring to open the bag and let the stink ooze out once again. He threw on some latex gloves as well as a clothes pin to staple his nose shut. Taking every bottle of cleaning detergent from the laundry room, he set them all side by side next to the sink, ready to try everything from bleach to pet-smell-remover to get rid of that fox smell starting to seep out from the thin plastic barrier.<br />
<br />
That damned fox… It was becoming the bane of Casey’s existence, peeing on his house… on his school stuff... his lucky underwear. Why? It didn’t pee on James’ stuff, and James didn’t seem to react as violently to that smell as he did. Why was it targeting him…?<br />
<br />
Casey locked the bathroom door behind him just in case his mom came home early. All prepped up like a surgeon ready to cut away at a patient, Casey dipped his fingers into the knot tying the plastic bag shut, slowly undoing it. Yellow dribbles of piss oozed out into the sink as he removed the plastic, the little boy trembling as it soaked his gloves, the cloth still warm.<br />
<br />
In a matter of second he had it all out, Casey holding it in his hands, eyeing it, finding that not an inch had been spared from the yellow stain! For some reason, the fox marked this more than anything, as if this was the thing that the fox had fished through his backpack for.<br />
<br />
“Wait… Wh-what…?” Casey gasped a little, feeling that humid fox musk sting across his tongue as he spot something that wasn’t piss. As he opened up his underwear, the fabric was glued with sticky strands of viscous, pearly goop that collected in the crotch area. There was a lot of it, that spunk starting to drool out like syrup as soon as Casey let it loose, dotting the sink with opalescent blobs of fox cream.<br />
<br />
Not only had that fox pissed in his lucky underwear… it came inside it too!<br />
<br />
“SNAP!!”<br />
<br />
Casey flinched as he felt the clothes pin protecting his nose suddenly snap off, clattering to the ground as the pressure of fox musk in the air began cloying at the boy’s nostrils. Holding his breath, he dipped down to pick up his life-line, trying to clip it back onto the bridge of his nose once again… but it was gone. Not the pin… but… his nose wasn’t shaped like this before!<br />
<br />
In a flurry of panic, the young boy grasped for it with both hands, trying to wrench that snout off his face or just it back in or something, but all it did was elongate! His lips joined with it as the bridge of his nose pushed out, the tip growing wet and leathery against his trembling fingers.<br />
<br />
His extended nose made it all the easy for that cruel stench of fox piss to travel straight to his brain, the sensitive hairs inside getting soaked stinging droplets of it! Inhuman pheromones began anchoring themselves deep in the recesses of his brain, branding it with fox stink as drool began to percolate in his longer maw, dripping from his lips.<br />
<br />
Casey tried to keep his mouth clamped a tight as an alligator’s, but it felt like he needed to hurl! He heaved, clenching his face tight before wrenching his muzzle open for the first time, a long vulpine tongue bursting out in an explosion of drool before lolling out, draped across his thinner lips. Saliva dripped all over the sink as the boy peered at himself in the mirror, watching himself pant like a dog trying to dispel the heat of piss in the air, fogging the mirror in front of him with hot puffs of breath.<br />
<br />
Now that he had a snout, it wasn’t just his nose that got its sensitivity increased twentyfold, but his sense of taste too. As his long tongue hung from his maw, he could all the better taste the miasma of fox urine heating up the bathroom, its astringent flavor littering his tastebuds like he’d licked it straight from the source. The taste was unimaginable, only comparable to tasting the saltiest, sourest lemon ever created at first, but it soon turned into something far more complex. It felt like the taste was expanding and filling his mouth as if hot piss-scented air was getting pumped right through his nostrils and bloating him up. Varying flavors started to peak through the salty acidity. Hints of bitter earth and sweet, hot spice, flared out in obnoxious bursts, Casey growing dizzier by the moment as he watched his teeth extend and sharpen inside that short proto-muzzle into canine teeth.<br />
<br />
It didn’t seem real. He felt like he was watching a horror movie through the mirror that was starring him! The stink was so overwhelming that Casey lifted his hands and began clutching his tongue tight. He squeezed, trying to wring the cursed flavor of fox piss from his mouth once and for all, but it just made it worse! The last thing he wanted was for the smell to get stronger, but it did regardless of what he tried. It had a spell over his body, the raucous stench prying its way inside him, holding all his senses hostage.<br />
<br />
The boy shakily propped his hand up on the sink as he kept panting, his muzzle inches away from the mirror as Casey reluctantly peering into it again. He wished he didn’t as he caught a glimpse of his ears stretching up to the tops of his head, embedding themselves in his… red hair!?<br />
<br />
Casey was always a blonde, how could it just have changed? The boy’s hands slipped out of those latex gloves and abandoned his muzzle to push those thin membrane of fox ears back to where they belonged. Not only did it not work, but he also felt those little velvety growths of orange fuzz blaze along the tips of them… but it wasn’t just his ears.<br />
<br />
Casey still felt the fuzz in his fingers even as he pulled them away, realizing that his hands were growing a thin blanket of creamy white fur too. The fright almost made him faint, Casey scrying into the mirror one more time as he watched his face start to get bathed in the stuff too, vibrant orange and white counter coloring beginning to shade his face just like…<br />
<br />
“A fox!?” Casey almost choked on the word as he put it all together, staring at the face of something that was half-Casey and half-fox in the mirror! All his features seemed too short to be a full-on fox’s, the animal parts merging into his human visage to make him look distinctly anthropomorphic.<br />
<br />
It was the piss, it had to be! The fox must have known what it was doing to him!<br />
<br />
Casey clumsily tried to wrap his hands around the doorknob like a drunk man to escape. Yet as he tried to wrap his hand around it, he found it was too fuzzy to get a grasp, a little stubbier too even! If the door wasn’t slippery with that fog of urine in the air, he would probably be able to get free, but for now, he was trapped! He turned around only to get another cruel look at his mutated face in the mirror. Casey was almost driven to tears, the young boy averting his gaze downward only to be met with his jizz-soaked pair of lucky underwear laying in the sink, still steaming with hot fox juices.<br />
<br />
Casey locked his dog-toother maw tight, drool seeping from his lips as he shook his head at it. It was gross, disgusting, he tried to pull himself away but couldn’t bring himself to! To his surprise the repulsive piece of underwear…<br />
<br />
… was making him hard.<br />
<br />
Casey shook his head in disbelief, his panting growing to a feverish pace as he worked his hands underneath his shorts and yanked them down to see if it was true. He spotted a bulge pushing at the crotch of his unsullied undies, wetness oozing out from underneath the fabric as if to enthusiastically say he was hornier than he’d ever been in his whole life! He sensed the palm of his hand feeling a little plusher as it gained new sensitivity, the boy running that ticklish palm around his thighs as he tugged down his underwear too, watching his boyhood spring free. It was already dewed with the piss in the air as it throbbed stronger than concrete. And then, seconds after it met escaped from its confines, it just started to dribble out piss!<br />
<br />
Casey felt his bladder start to let loose, his softer scent joining the harsh scent of fox pee littering the air. The boy didn’t have the wherewithal to aim at the toilet, the urine splattering on the cabinet and clothes bins as the boy dizzily rocked back and forth, blood rushing to his groin and away from his brain. Reason escaped him as inner lust roiled to the surface. The needy boy scooped up his slimy pair of lucky underwear from before shakily propping himself against the shower wall, letting his piss leak out as brought those undies right up to his snout.<br />
<br />
In that fog of lurid pheromones, Casey stuffed that cummy underwear right up against his snout and huffed in the fox’s scent like a drug. The stench urged away his inhibitions as the boy started to stroke himself off, his bladder hosing piss into the bathtub faster than it could sink down the drain! His eyes screwed tight in bliss. He opened his mouth and licked, piss oozing straight out of the fabric and attacking his senses with the male fox’s robust intensity! He licked again and again, this time aiming for the pearly white fox jizz staining the fabric, letting the taboo taste of a feral male sizzle on his lips before swallowing it down, then going back for more!<br />
<br />
That assault of fox lust wreaked havoc on his young mind, forcing his paw-like hand to piston on his modest four-inch length. Casey felt some sort of pouch-like protrusion forming at the base of his cock as he stroked, a plush furrow fuzzy flesh building as he forced his penis to the edge!<br />
<br />
Yet right as he was about to hit the brink of euphoria, the boy’s mouth snapped shut as he began to growl, jutting his rear back as a sudden burst from his spine punctuated the top of his butt. Orange and white fur cascaded down in broad, fluffy clumps until a fox tail wagged fitfully behind him, Casey’s legs and butt now carpeted with orange fur as white fuzz sprouted up along his belly.<br />
<br />
In a matter of seconds, fur carpeted every visible inch of flesh, sensation piling onto sensation as Casey’s panting maw clapped wide-open. He was so hot his panting couldn’t dispel the heat any longer, the fox-boy groggily holding himself upright as he started to nibble and bite at his lucky underwear. His little, fuzzy balls started to churn and tighten as pressure built up until it just couldn’t be damned any longer!<br />
<br />
“Hrreaahh!... Hrughhh…”<br />
<br />
His voice whined in a high vulpine pitch before he plugged his mouth up!<br />
<br />
The taste mesmerized him. Overpowering fox scent dilated his eyes like an Iowaska trip as he stuffed as much cummy-underwear into his muzzle as he could!<br />
<br />
His body stiffen up like he was struck by lightning. A guttural yip gurgled under that soiled pair of underwear as he rocked forward, his cock leading his whole body as it switched from spurting out urine to a geyser of hot, white jizz!<br />
<br />
For a few moments, the boy was in euphoria. His tail wagged like an excited puppy, the fox’s semen giving making him feel like dad was home! He felt high, ecstasy washing over him until the last few spurts of seed splattered on the other end of the tub wall, Casey stepping off his prestigious high to a groggy low.<br />
<br />
Casey’s maw sprung open as he spat out the underwear, the half-fox-half-boy collapsing on the toilet seat as he tried to regain his bearings. He held up his hand and found his palms tipped with paw pads, tiny claws poking out of his digits. As his penis grew flaccid after that epic cum-shot, that fuzzy white pouch that had formed at the base easily snaked over the soft piece of boy meat, swallowing it up inch by inch until the stubborn fringe of his acorn-like cock head pouted out the top of his new sheath. Casey watched in bewilderment as his entire cock seemed to reposition, the sheath tugging up until it stuck to his lower belly. He reached out a paw-hand to touch it but before he could, his glans head of his penis slipped inside its new tight and slimy confines. Being circumcised, he couldn’t deny it felt amazing having his penis inside a new moist home.<br />
<br />
The warm feeling of that sheath couldn’t stay reality violently rearing its ugly head. Casey remembering what he looked like, terrified what his family and friends would think! He was a freak, some sort of weird creature that’d be kept inside some sort of giant test tube and have run experiments on for the rest of his life! He had to find a way to change himself back, and somehow he just knew he needed to get that fox that had been pissing everywhere that caused all of this. If anyone was gonna get locked inside a lab and experimented on, it was going to be him! If it made him change, then it must be able to change him back too!<br />
<br />
He had to find it. He really really needed to meet that fox… he really really wanted to meet it too…</p>
