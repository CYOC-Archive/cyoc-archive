<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miles Standing was properly notified on the creation of 154 and 155, and based on the email that he received, all of the paperwork was in order. He did send an email that the paper copies would need to be delivered to the US State Department and potentially the US Defense Department in addition to his own offices. The measures followed all the bureaucratic principles, and so long as the Gynoids didn&#39;t use direct force against humanity was about all that could be done directly. However, that didn&#39;t leave him without options to protect humanity should they become either dangerous or begin to demand more or attain successes that threaten humanity&#39;s extinction. He didn&#39;t hate the Gynoids and so long as they remained non violent and followed what had been agreed to regarding &quot;uplifting&quot; people, he would do what he could to defend their little embassy and operation, but he did favor the protection of humanity and didn&#39;t think that turning every single human into a Gynoid was a good idea.<br />
<br />
As such, with much of his direct contact with the Gynoids now over with their office now their embassy, he was free to oversee the direct look at what he had gotten regarding their technology and what 9901 had shared with him in the questioning sessions. 9901 had been very cooperative with him and shared quite a lot about their technology and potential capabilities, though made common statements in opposition to killing and violence. However, that gave Miles plenty openings to put together means of defense, though it had also put together a lot of work, since the facility had to be kept on its own power supply and not connected to ANY internet or digital technology, since that might allow the Gynoids to know fully well what was being done to defend Earth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure on the relevance of all this,&quot; one of Miles&#39; own superior officers commented as he placed his cellphone in a plastic tray at the entry gate to the facility.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re are race of interstellar robots that have landed and can communicate throughout their domain through their own internet system and have reported that they can remotely access OUR internet systems,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;If we leave any cameras here or anything that has access to the internet... THEY can access it remotely and learn EXACTLY what we&#39;re doing here. It&#39;s why this facility has no internet connection and all reports I&#39;ve sent on the facility have only been paper copies with the order that they are NOT uploaded to any electronic source... and why the Defense Department has mandated that rule. It is to protect the only way we can possibly defend ourselves should the Gynoids decide to become aggressive...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think they will?&quot; the superior officer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly... no,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t remove the possibility that it could happen... or that we could be ordered to take them down before they prove to be a threat to our extinction... even if it&#39;s a &quot;willing&quot; one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other general shrugged as Miles handed his own cellphone to the guard and soon felt the Humvee pull forward. The facility had two sections. One was a large hanger in which 9901&#39;s ship had been taken and disassembled and where the components of the ship were being analyzed by the men under Miles&#39; direct command. It had revealed a lot and several of the scientists and engineers involved in the project were developing ideas they wanted to share with NASA regarding 9901&#39;s ship, but all of it remained only an information gathering mission in that portion of the base, in case 9901&#39;s ship had some recording device that the Gynoid might have remote access to. He looked at that facility quietly as the driver drove past it. That made him blink and then look over to Miles.<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren&#39;t going to see the ship?&quot; the general asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can see it,&quot; Miles replied, &quot;but I was thinking you&#39;d most want to see what we have to defend ourselves should things go bad...&quot;<br />
<br />
The general nodded before a question came to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they have some ability to see what you&#39;ve had built here at all?&quot; the general asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;9901 may have had access to our satellite imagery to watch us build the buildings, but unless NASA has a flying x-ray machine, it&#39;s unlikely that she could see inside the building,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;so what we&#39;ve developed from what we&#39;ve learned from her is quite safe. As  far as I know is that all she knows is that we are taking steps to make sure we can respond should she have a malfunction or something in her statements about being non-violent proves to be false.&quot;<br />
<br />
The general nodded and sat along as the Humvee rode along toward a massive square building ahead of them. It was far enough away from the hanger that one could scream at the top of their lungs and not be heard at the other building. And as they got closer, the general grew more and more surprised by how big the building in fact was. They came up to a large garage door that was forty feet long by twenty feet tall, and the building was another forty feet taller than the door and its wall&#39;s sides were actually sixty feet long. It was essentially a sixty foot cubed building. It wasn&#39;t a skyscraper when compared to buildings of Manhattan or Chicago, but it was still a big building, considering what Miles had reported in a written letter was in the building. They parked outside the building as the garage door opened. The general only looked to see a set of railroad tracks coming out from the garage door.<br />
<br />
&quot;The weapon is a train?&quot; the general asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s on railroad tracks, but it isn&#39;t a train,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;the use of a railroad carriage is simply for stability.&quot;<br />
<br />
They entered to see a massive rail-car on which an equally large looking artillery piece sat. At the same time, the barral of the cannon looked like it was telescoping and could be extended if necessary and there were several wires and cables that were fitted to various portions of the gun and they ran to other electrical looking devices on the ground and what looked like power cables  and plugins on the concrete floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said there was no electronic devices here?&quot; the general said in wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said their are no computers or digital equipment,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;this... this is like a toaster. It&#39;s electrical but has no real computerized brain and couldn&#39;t explain anything. Even if the Gynoids could somehow &quot;talk&quot; to it...it&#39;d be like us trying to hold a philosophical conversation with a domestic dog. They won&#39;t get anything that really explains what this does or what it is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what is this?&quot; the general asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Essentially a giant version of the electromagnetic projectors on 9901&#39;s ship,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;constructed from our own materials and based off what we&#39;ve analyzed from her ship and its weaponry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An electromagnetic pulse?&quot; the general asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, think on the pulse that occurs just before a nuclear weapon explodes,&quot; Miles explained, &quot;but lacks the explosive burst and nuclear radiation... it&#39;d shut down ANY electronic or computerized device, and that would include the Gynoids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When 9901 turned her ship over to us, she was present for when we started taking it apart,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;and she seemed extremely cautious over the electromagnetic projectors on her ship... as if they were a threat to her. They served as a defensive weapon but that doesn&#39;t mean an accident could happen and affect her. So, she could be vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse, just as any other electronic device would be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could this kill her... if need be?&quot; the general asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I&#39;m not sure... I&#39;d tend to think not,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;more that it would knock her out until she and her &quot;sisters&quot; could recover. The power levels we have here though... exceed those on her ship as we have this gun hooked up to more power generators than her ship could have held... and our gun is obviously bigger... so it might provide enough of a shock that she would be effectively killed unless another Gynoid comes by later and hits some sort of reboot switch... and even if the effect is only temporary, we have enough power committed that we&#39;d buy time for the arrests to be made painlessly and quietly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The general could only whistle at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;But as I said, sir,&quot; Miles then finished, &quot;we&#39;d only need this for the Gynoids if they come to be a threat to humanity&#39;s existence as a species or if she becomes violent... which I don&#39;t think will happen. More than likely I&#39;d think we&#39;d end up firing this at the Russians before we fire it at the Gynoids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All this to defend against a nonviolent attacker...&quot; the general commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... it&#39;s odd...&quot; Miles nodded, &quot;but it never hurts to be prepared for the just in case scenario. 9901 has at times in some interviews made commentary about computer viruses giving her some difficulty... this is in case of that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In case some lunatic gives them a computer virus?&quot; the general raised an eyebrow. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t we want to get our own tech guys there to kill the computer virus and help her in such a scenario?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once she can be secured... though we don&#39;t know what a Earth born computer virus would do to a Gynoid,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;suppose it overwrites her intent to be non-violent? Or totally erases her mind and leaves her insane?  That is our potential nightmare scenario where we&#39;d have to use this gun. And we will have to be prepared for it... and hope that day never comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The general agreed. The size of the weapon gave him the implication that even if they hit their intended target, they would affect more than just the Gynoids. And for that reason, he agreed with General Miles Standing in the hopes that they&#39;d never have to fire the gun.</p>
