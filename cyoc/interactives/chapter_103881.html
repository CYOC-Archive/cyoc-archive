<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time I&#39;ve stopped the car at grandma&#39;s, I couldn&#39;t be more glad to be stopped. Amy&#39;s been pleasantly unbearable.<br />
<br />
The entire time getting ready and driving here, it&#39;s been painfully obvious that she could care less for the proof. Apparently, my &#39;caring goodie act&#39; excited her enough that she&#39;d prefer that we had taken a pitstop for some &#39;fun&#39;. She flirted with me the entire drive, all while not pushing anything too far.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s clear that she wanted me to make the &#39;first move&#39;. And she was so good with flirting that, had I not been driving, I would have rutted her right there, mom or no mom.<br />
<br />
As it is, she&#39;s given me a serious case of blue balls...<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, what a groovy place.&quot;<br />
<br />
...and the way she shakes her body as she&#39;s checking out my grandma&#39;s house isn&#39;t making it any easier.<br />
<br />
&#39;I wish that I wasn&#39;t suffering such a case of blue balls here...&#39; To my pleasant surprise, the ring heard my thoughts, and the pressure I was experiencing started to decline, literally feeling myself empty there as my own sperm seemed to vanish for the time being.<br />
<br />
...Though, all it took to start it again was looking at Amy, her finger seductively chewed on with her lips, batting her pretty eyes with her chest thrust out as she asked how this would prove to her about the time era she&#39;s now in.<br />
<br />
I sigh as I walk towards her. This will be a long day, but the longer it goes, the longer I question whether to turn her back or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your parents&#39; house, or where they moved to since you were young. Once you see them, you&#39;ll see that I wasn&#39;t lying about you being in the future.&quot; I briefly go over to the door to knock as she shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, it&#39;s cute how hard you&#39;re trying to prove it&#39;s not a prank, cutie, but I could care less. Rather go out and have some fun. You need to loosen up a bit.&quot; Placing her hands on her back while on her tiptoes, she breathes in his ears, &quot;And I know the grooviest way to do so, if you&#39;re willing to take me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t help the pleasant shiver that goes down my spine. Why does she make it so hard to want her to return to normal?!<br />
<br />
Thankfully, I&#39;m soon saved, as grandma answers the door.<br />
<br />
She&#39;s aged particularly well, with her long brown hair, streaked with grey. She&#39;s kept herself fit, despite being raised in a time where girls are meant to be like homesteaders. She exudes a friendly homely feel about her, her kind face and gentle blue eyes. Though, like mom, her breasts are sizable. No doubt, mom got her figure from her.<br />
<br />
She gives a surprised smile as she looks at us. &quot;Joey! What a pleasant surprise! Come in! Come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
She quickly ushers us in, though I have to grab hold of Amy&#39;s hand, cause she seems stunned as she sees her mother. Seems she&#39;s recognized her, if her bug-eyed expression is any tell to her feelings.<br />
<br />
Turning to Amy, I smile at her, &quot;Come on, Amy.&quot; She stutters in surprise as she nods, &quot;S-Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
We&#39;re soon led into the living room, where grandpa is. Shaggy blonde like his daughter, with white stripes all over his hair hair, and a notable mustache. His brown eyes seem to twinkle in delight to see us as he looks up from some paperwork he was looking over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey, my boy, how&#39;ve you been?&quot; Noticing Amy, he raised an eyebrow as she stared with shock at him. &quot;...And who&#39;s this sexy thing? Your girlfriend perhaps? ...She seems familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
His grandma nods, &quot;Yes. She does seem awfully familiar, but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy tugs on my sleeve as she looks worriedly at him. &quot;Like, I... believe ya, now, cutie. Could I... Could I have a moment to myself, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nod at her, &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s alright with you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grandma nods with a concerned smile, &quot;Certainly, dear. You can use the bedroom at the top of the stairs to clear your head.&quot;<br />
<br />
My grandparents watch her fondly as she ascends the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting girl, you brought over, Joey,&quot; Grandma said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. A rather clingy girl at that, eh Edith? Reminds me of our little Ames at that age,&quot; Grandpa joked.<br />
<br />
I swallow, &quot;That&#39;s... cause it is her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two look at me incredulously. Before they respond, I look hard at them, &quot;Seriously. That was mom. She changed before my eyes at home... for some reason or other.&quot;<br />
<br />
I neglect to tell them the full truth. One shocker at a time. ...besides, I&#39;m still uncertain whether I like this or not.<br />
<br />
Taking a while to ponder, grandpa stares holes into me as grandma shakily decides to sit down.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Boy, why did you bring her here then?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrug, &quot;I&#39;m not sure. She wouldn&#39;t believe me when I told her the year it is, and I tried to get her to believe me. I haven&#39;t decided what to do with her yet. Though, she&#39;s a lot more flirty than I thought she&#39;d be at this age.&quot; ...Which is very much true at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-She didn&#39;t seem that way to us...&quot; Grandma politely pointed out.<br />
<br />
Looking at her, I stated, &quot;...You didn&#39;t see how she was on the way here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grandpa bitterly laughs, &quot;Great! We have to deal with a slutty child again. Better to just leave her to her own than deal with that mess again.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can feel anger burning at his words, and I&#39;m not the only one.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you say that?! She&#39;s our child!&quot; Grandma screamed.<br />
<br />
... I&#39;m glad to think that the upstair rooms are fairly sound proof. Mom doesn&#39;t need this on top of her own emotional problems right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so she can handle things herself! She may have been a slut, but she knew how to handle herself. Unlike you back then!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another barbed insult. And the volume isn&#39;t helping my head. Now, I remember why visiting my grandparents was a bitter-sweet deal. Their occasional fights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, excuse me for being raised to be a proper wife back then! You don&#39;t know how hard it was!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, how hard indeed. Just cooking, cleaning, and putting out. How hard that must have been.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, why must you be so insufferable sometimes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their arguing was quickly rubbing off on me. They&#39;re starting to go off on a tangent, so I decide to step in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you two forgetting why we&#39;re discussing this in the first place?! What about your daughter?&quot; I interject.<br />
<br />
They turn to me and tell me to stay out of it.<br />
<br />
Red-faced, I fume. They are completely ignoring their own daughter&#39;s feelings in their rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think she feels?! She has no memories beyond the age of her own body. She feels alone and out of touch with the world, and you two are arguing about whether to help her?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s our kid. She&#39;ll adapt!&quot; Grandpa groused.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it. I snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you two were sexy, flirty girls her age like she is! Experiencing the same circumstances she is with the time era displaced memories and such! Maybe then, you&#39;d understand her better!&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling a tingle from my ring, the room quiets down. A chill goes down my spine as I realize what I just said.</p>
