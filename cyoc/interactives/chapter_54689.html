<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided to go to the main library at his high school, since that was the place where the group of geeks would most likely hang out. He had overheard in science class that a group of the geekiest students liked hanging out in the far back corner of the library, where all the science and math and computer books were located.<br />
<br />
Ty walked into the library and went to the far back. The library wasn't very big, so he got there in no time. There were several tables set up near the back of the room, close to several tall bookshelves where all the math and computer books were located. Ty placed his math book on the table and started reading, when he heard a commotion from a distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me alone, you jerk!&quot; a boy shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;SHHHHH!&quot; another girl hissed. &quot;We're studying! Will you be quiet?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy was followed by another one, while he marched to the table in the back, next to the one where Ty was sitting at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me alone! I'm not giving you the answers to the math test, so get lost!&quot; the boy whispered to the other guy, who was bigger and taller than him. &quot;Just because you're on the football team doesn't mean you don't need to study!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bigger student turned around and walked away, angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get you for this, you geek!&quot;<br />
<br />
The geek then sat down and sighed. Ty concentrated on him and was able to read his mind, thanks to his powers. He learned that his name was Alec, and he was one of the smartest guys in math.<br />
<br />
Ty got up and moved to Alec's table, and placed his book next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi...&quot; Alec replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you're in my algebra class...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I saw you in class earlier. I sit all the way towards the front.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do... Do you get bullied a lot?&quot; Ty wondered.<br />
<br />
Alec just stared at Ty for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to talk about it...&quot; was his answer.<br />
<br />
Ty took that as a yes. He decided to stay quiet and to wait for the right moment to help the geeky student out. Luckily, he didn't have to wait too long to do it.<br />
<br />
Only five minutes had passed, when Alec stood up and carried a book to the shelf. While he stood there, looking over the other math books, Ty decided to put his mojo to use.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to muscle up, Alec...&quot; Ty whispered, with a sly grin on his face. <br />
<br />
Alec was about 5 feet tall and skinny. He wore a t-shirt and a pair of shorts, since it was only the middle of August and the second week of school. In other words, it was over 90 degrees outside. He had short, black hair and brown eyes, and he wore a black t-shirt with some geeky expression on it, that read something like “there is no place like 127.0.0.1”.<br />
<br />
While Alec was looking over the math books, he began to feel an odd sensation in his legs. His calves seemed to slowly inflate, with its muscles growing at a constant rate, thanks to Ty’s wish. Alec reached down to scratch his left calf, only to notice that his leg seemed slightly harder and bigger. Was he gaining some muscle?<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled as the geek stood there, looking over the books, while he slowly hulked out. Alec’s calves now bulged out even more, forming two nice mounds of muscle on each leg, which began to stick out from the back of the boy’s leg. He no longer looked like a geek but a cyclist or a soccer player.<br />
<br />
Next, Alec’s quads began to swell, as they grew thicker and wider at the same time, due to the expanding muscle. Slowly but surely, layers of muscle began forming on the legs between the knees and the waist, making the boy look even more athletic. Truly, Ty was doing everything possible to make Alec look like a jock and no longer look like a geek, with those muscular legs!<br />
<br />
It was at this point, when Alec started to really take note that his body was changing. He looked down and noticed that his legs had become thicker and heavier, due to the added muscle. His quads had expanded tremendously, gaining inches of muscle by growing wider and thicker. His quads had also gained that teardrop-look, especially near the front of his legs, due to several layers of muscle sticking out further on his massive legs. <br />
<br />
“What the heck?” Alec whispered to himself, as he looked down. His shorts were starting to fit tight around his bulging legs. Not only that, but his legs felt stronger and heavier at the same time. “Wait a minute? My legs have grown! How can that be? I have never worked out in my life!”<br />
<br />
Ty directed his growth upward and focused on Alec’s torso and the rest of his upper body. Next, his flat stomach now widened as his chest pushed outward and sideways while his abdominals slowly surfaced on his previously flat stomach. He was no longer a skinny geek, by no means. Rows and columns of buttons formed on his torso, covering his tummy and forming a shield of muscle like a shell. <br />
<br />
Next, his pectorals rapidly inflated into spheres of heavy, bulging muscle, forcing his shoulders outwards and making his arms grow wider and thicker in the process. Not only that, but his neck grew wider as well, as thick muscle surrounded his shoulder blades. His mighty pectorals continued to harden as they pushed outward, making his chest feel much harder and heavier. He was hit by a surge of upper-body strength, when his hard pecs finished growing. His shirt was very, very tight!<br />
<br />
Finally, his biceps and triceps inflated to the size of bowling balls, pushing the fabric of his t-shirt to the limit. As expected, the sleeves were about to tear, when Ty made them disappear, and transformed the t-shirt into a tank-top, revealing Alec’s mighty biceps and bulging arms for everyone to see. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! My arms! My chest! What is this??” Alec gasped.<br />
<br />
Alec slowly turned and began to walk back to the table, when Ty spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Looking great, big guy! I bet none of those jocks will pick on you anymore!” he said to the muscular geek.<br />
<br />
Alec sat down, and stared at Ty with a confused look on his face.<br />
<br />
Ty silently wished for Alec to think it was perfectly normal for him to be muscular, and for him to enjoy being a big geek.<br />
<br />
“Oh… Yeah… The jocks don’t pick on me… Not anymore…” Alec grinned.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m a bit of a geek… So you can be my bodyguard!” Ty laughed.<br />
<br />
“Sure! I’ll protect ya, Ty!” Alec smiled. “And, I’ll tutor you in math!”<br />
<br />
Ty just smiled as he looked around. Other geeks were walking up to him, and sitting down at the table. For Ty, that meant that there were other geeky students who needed to grow more muscular, just like Alec…</p>
