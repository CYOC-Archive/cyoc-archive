<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Looks at the other chapters. A lot of robots with various jobs. An option bringing up prompts that reach from the mundane to extravagant/fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... Robots with jobs...<br/>
<br/>
Robots that are Masters of their fields.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can see where I got some inspiration from. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He wouldn&#39;t mean to aim for something too out there, Jake presumed, as he reviewed the tab. Typing in some ideas here and there too, Stripper, Professional Gamer, Plumber, Motorcycle Racer- Yeah, it had those options in there. Even if this thing couldn&#39;t rewrite reality, plenty of work has seemingly gone into the UI and the options available within. But Jake tried to focus, looking into the box for instructions for this somewhat antiquated feeling piece of tech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maximum Distance, 20 feet. Portable Emitter... Legacy version can only turn living beings into other living beings...&quot; He muttered as he continued to investigate the options. His foot tapping as he thought more about the possibilities- Before shaking his head and <b>focus.</b> Okay. Job. Mike wants a job- A reasonable job- A job he would be hired at, since this only affects how people perceive reality. So, he would need to get hired instead of getting the job off of the bat.<br />
<br />
Jake forcibly looks at the list, shakes his head, and sternly picks Electrician.<br />
There. Yes. He picked the option and...<br />
<br />
A prompt opened up to give him more options to struggle through. His eyebrow raising as he read through it, Mundane to Extravagant. Clicking them led to a new prompt on what level to go within there... And to give Mike the best chance, Jake chose to go into Extravagant. And from the options there, he immediately chose what presumably would be the maximum. Fantastical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, so, what else to do?&quot; Jake asked himself, as he saved that in. Looking over, there was a few warnings regarding physical alterations that he ignored after determining that they wouldn&#39;t harm his pal, a prompt to specify and review the occupation and what it would do- But he ignored that too. Jake just needed to get Mike here, and get him scanned before getting this set up.<br />
<br />
<center>---</center><br />
<br />
It was only half an hour until Mike returned, looking as glum as usual, the hairgel in his hair beginning to fade a bit with strands popping out. &quot;Hey Jake...&quot; He sighed, as he took off his jacket and made his way to the closet. &quot;Hope you&#39;re doing well,&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake turned to see his friend and gave a thumbs up. &quot;Yeah, I guess I&#39;ve been doing pretty good today, how&#39;d the interview go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For Maelstrom Electronics or Pizza House?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...You know the answer already,&quot; Mike shook his head as he picked up some clothes to put on after showering, before taking a look at Jake&#39;s laptop. &quot;Hm? What&#39;s that? CAD?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you could say that,&quot; Jake remarked with a shrug, quickly going to another tab in the Chronivac software to hastily scan in Mike. &quot;Did you order something too? I got this from a package outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N- No... Well, only some GSubs, money has been tight so I can&#39;t get any Playboy this month,&quot; Mike remarked, yawning before slinking into the bathroom. Not noticing Jake&#39;s smirk as Jake looked over the gathered data.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Seriously? This thing has all of the information on Jake! Age, exact measurements, nationality!&quot;</i> He whispered in excitement, plugging in the occupation there and looking into some last few options. Hm, World Awareness, Self-Awareness, and the Duration of both the Transformation and on how long it lasts..<br />
<br />
N, excluding Jake. He doesn&#39;t want to know what would happen if he lost his own memory.<br />
N. Jake wants Mike to believe he&#39;s the greatest Electrician in the world, it would probably not be a good idea if Mike knew that he isn&#39;t supposed to have these skills... Maybe...<br />
10 Minutes. Mike takes around that long to get showered.<br />
Indefinite. Why shouldn&#39;t it be permanent?<br />
<br />
He hit Save.<br />
<br />
And watched as it began to load in the new profile for Mike.<br />
<br />
His gentle smirk fading as each detail set into place.<br />
<br />
<center>---</center><br />
<br />
A nice cold shower always helped Mike ignore his problems for a time. It is a nasty shock for sure, but the chill helps out still by giving him something else to focus on as opposed to his constant failure to get a job and to get a life. His family already dislikes him enough for being ace, and have been ragging on him a lot when he calls back to get a job since he&#39;s 18 and went through a semester of college!<br />
<br />
But here, he can ignore that as he rubbed his hair, feeling the gel get soaked and drip out of the increasingly smooth surface of his increasingly orange head nicely.<br />
<br />
Wait, head? Why would he ever put hairgel there, he always does it in his mane. Which he went down too, over his neck and back, feeling some cognitive dissonance as he felt even his growing mane grow harder and more metallic. Why had he put hair gel over that motorized section? Wait, oh- Right! He... Thought it would have been a suitable alternative to polish, since they didn&#39;t have any polish in the dorm. Some nice polish to give those dull parts of his body a nice sheen, such as the bright yellow paneling covering his outlets on the back or the metal &#39;fluff&#39; around his neck to help shield that section from damage.<br />
<br />
With those completed, he picked up some soap with growing caution as his arms began to turn mechanical too, and hands, sharpened into claws at the end. Claws designed to be conductive as another point for gathering electricity for either the job he was built for, or just to help charge him up; and sharp to help him get a fine grip and feel for wiring. But like the rest of his body, water-proofed for when he washed himself. Though it did feel especially cramped for him today. Moke&#39;s arms beginning to grow out to accomodate various pieces of hardware, especially batteries and fuses; alongside containers for extra batteries and fuses to help at work, especially the forearms bulking up and giving them a bit of an armoed appearance.<br />
<br />
His chest would soon begin to undergo proper changes too, beyond just turning metal. As Mote washed his chest and the part of it somewhat covered up by his &#39;fluff&#39;, it began to gain a far more armored appearance, alongside it barelling out a bit to gain a less humanoid look to Mota&#39;s changing body. With him soon hunching over too, just for a bit as his spinal changes set in, curving his back to help get a feel for his outlets and give him a suitable position when linked up. After that, with his shoulders being adjusted here and there, alongside parts of his former flesh extending out into orange armor vaguely reminiscent of more fluff, helping shield two of his motors/emergency-backup generators.<br />
<br />
With his upper chest done with for the most part, in the middle, five yellow gems formed, each one meant to show the state of his power- If he&#39;s overloaded or if he&#39;s low on power or if his generators are already in use- And his abdomen&#39;s structure was modified, barelling out a bit too, but slimming down here and there as well, to support his upper body.<br />
<br />
But in general, his body was feeling increasingly imbalanced as Moter found himself struggling to stay upright, his human legs barely being able to support his changed body. But not for too long, as after a minute, they too began to change. His hips spreading out and widening a bit too, to give him a stance tailor made for this shape. With this change also leading to a certain organ being removed, his waste is only in heat and worn down pieces, not in any significant solid nor fluid form; not to mention that a robot like him wouldn&#39;t be able to reproduce in such a manner. Moving on, his thighs soon thickening up with motors, two more generators, and cutting edge supports made to help keep him upright from the thighs. His forelegs similarly thickened, in a similar manner to how his forearms in fact, to enhance his capabilities for balance and to protect his internal mechanisms down there and within his increasingly sharp feet! More akin to plantigrade paws at this point, except instead of five or four toes, there are only three claws.<br />
<br />
But there was still some changes to go, as Motor went to finish cleaning himself up. As he rinsed the soap off of his armored shell, from the base of his spine, a thick and flexible segmented tail grew out, with it wagging the water to splash on the walls. With that done, he unsteadily stepped out of the shower. Almost shaking himself, before noticing the clothes around. He&#39;d better not risk angering his dormmate by accidentally damaging his clothes. So, Motor Mane went to look into the mirror, towel in claw, before carefully drying himself.<br />
<br />
His human face vanishing, as his ears sharpened, extended and moved to the top of his head, the shape of his head being adjusted to fit with the rest of his body, and his nose and mouth extending out into a sharp snout. One tipped with a dark orange nose to help with heat regulation. His sharp ears swiveling a bit around as he stretched a bit.<br />
<br />
Motor Mane thought it felt especially refreshing today, as he looked in satisfaction at his clean and vaguely lupine face. Both his pupils and the white of his eyes turning completely green. As it always has been for Motor Mane.<br />
<br />
<center>---</center><br />
<br />
Jake was beginning to panic. He just turned his dormmate, his friend, into some sort of superadvanced robot that&#39;s like straight out a certain video game franchise, made him and the rest of the world think this is normal, and potentially will have to deal with the consequences of his actions thanks to putting it as indefinite. Damnit Jake, what was he thinking?!<br />
<br />
Despite hearing some very mechanical sounds from the bathroom, Jake tried to convince himself for a few minutes that this isn&#39;t real. The Chronivac didn&#39;t work. It just somehow got data and everything will be fine! Completely and utterly <i>fine!</i><br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s hopes were dashed completely as he saw a tall maned wolf re- robot step out of the bathroom door. Awkwardly waving at Jake, to his relief...<br />
<br />
Okay. Mike may think this is normal, but he still seems to be acting like Mike. That&#39;s... Certainly something. And Jake gave an awkward wave back. &quot;Hey Mike,&quot;<br />
<br />
And Motor Mane looked at Jake with some confusion before saying, &quot;Oh- Right, hello there Jake, I am feeling particularly exhausted today, I&#39;m going to go to bed and recharge a bit. Please be quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaving Jake in front of the laptop, the program still open... And one that he would close. Soon sighing and going to read some ebooks on his Congo Tinder account, and wiki pages on a certain video game franchise. Before slinking off to his own bed.<br />
<br />
It took him a few hours to sleep.</p>
