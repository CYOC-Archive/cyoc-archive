<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff still felt himself erect and solid, aching to cum and on the verge of peeing, but unable to as a solid stone statue. But the mirror that was keeping him trapped and forcing his time in this blissful agony was now obstructed from his view, all because his college brother had draped a jacket over his head. If he couldn’t see the mirror, the parameters of the Chronivac should be counting down now. Of course, he had no way of checking. The computer stayed on behind him, hopefully counting down the time until he could pee and cum again, but there was nothing he could do to know for sure.<br />
<br />
Jake was still in his room, however, gathering up laundry in Jeff’s room. He gathered up all the dirty laundry that Jeff had left behind, piling high in a basket. He snuck around the naked, stone Jeff, giving it one more look over.<br />
<br />
“Never knew that Jeff was this good at sculpting,” Jake said. “Kind of weird that he did a guy with that big of a dick, though.” Jake reached out in curiosity to touch the stone schlong.<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel as his brother touched his stone dick as it stuck straight up in front of him. He was already panged with the need to cum, but his brother’s touch drove him even higher. Where the Chronivac forced him to 100% horniness, the touch on his dick made him feel at 150% for the short moment he was rubbed.<br />
<br />
Once his curiosity was satiated, he turned to leave. “I wonder where the little bro went,” he said as he trotted down to the laundry room.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat in excruciating darkness for a while longer. Between mitigating his permanently full bladder feeling and hope that he would finish his eternally impending orgasm, all he could think about was the hope that the clock was counting down from the two days he had already accumulated.<br />
<br />
He had no idea exactly how long he was waiting there, but soon he heard Jake approaching again.<br />
<br />
“I guess that twerp isn’t coming home to see his big brother,” Jake complained. Unknown to him, Jake was right here, albeit bare-assed and erect, a fully aware statue in pleasurable distress.<br />
<br />
Jake continued with his musings, “He won’t even get to thank me for cleaning his clothes.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was certainly concerned with other things at the moment, but he thought to himself how he’d rather have been wearing the clothes. Even though he had given himself the body of a random boy, there was still a part of him that was incredibly embarrassed to be erect and naked in front of his brother, unable to move or even cover himself up. He didn’t even have the option of covering up his rigid cock, much less stepping into a pair of clean undies.<br />
<br />
“Oh well,” Jake continued. “Maybe he’ll find it funny to see his clothes hanging dry on this statue.’<br />
<br />
To Jeff’s horror, the jacket was lifted off his eyes! Thankfully, his mirror was not in sight, since his bedroom door was open, but all it would take is for Jake to close it on the way out.<br />
<br />
Jake proceeded to take clothes and hang them from Jeff’s body. He hung a dress shirt over his shoulders, hung a pair of shorts over the right shoulder, and then a t-shirt on the left shoulder. Comically, he took one sock and slid it over Jeff’s rigid member. “Cover up, bud! Ha! Hope I don’t come back to find that all crusty.” As a final bit of humiliation, Jeff slid a single pair of tighty-whities over his head, covering his face back up with the butt fabric.<br />
<br />
“Ha! Hopefully he’ll find that funny,” Jake proclaimed. “I’ll just leave the rest of his laundry on the bed.” Jake was silent for a few moments, but then he heard Jake say. “Looks like the bro left his computer on.”<br />
<br />
Jeff foggy, horny, desperate brain became intensely fearful, wondering what Jake might do. Not being able to see through the underwear on his head, all he could do was listen. Nothing was said for a few moments, but soon, Jake talked out loud to himself, as he was prone to do.<br />
<br />
“Hm. None of that makes sense,” Jake said. “Whatever it is has a whole day and twenty hours left to go. Best not touch it and make Jeff angry for when he gets back.” With that, Jeff heard Jake exit, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Because the underwear was on his face, Jeff couldn’t see the mirror, but because Jake was talkative, Jeff knew that his counter was finally counting down. The pain and pleasure he was feeling finally had an expiration date. Yes, he was being used as a clothesline, and yes, the sock his brother had put on his cock was causing him a slight bit more humiliation and overbearing pleasure, but at least he knew there was an end in sight. Any time he was able to clear his mind, he prayed for nothing else to go wrong.</p>
