<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason and Sarah go to bed, still contemplative, Jason is thinking about the whole host of experiences he had, the feelings flooding his mind and can&#39;t really rest, still processing everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sarah, do you think that this whole thing, I dunno, might have been predestined?&quot; Asked Jason, with a daydreaming smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;In what way?&quot; Asked Sarah, curious about what Jason had in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, it is just, I never stopped to think about the things I&#39;m thinking today, not because they didn&#39;t think them, just that, I tried my hardest to avoid them. You know. You just seem to so good at going with the flow, in siezing the moment, that was something I was always kind of jealous about you.&quot; Said Jason, thinking about all of the things that he wouldn&#39;t have tried before and is now excited to try.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe in any of that destiny mumbo jumbo, but it sure seems like that you got some serious hangups from the start.&quot; Said Sarah, wondering where Jason was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I never really realised it before, but I was really worried about others and what would they think to be able to try anything. Now that I don&#39;t have anyone to judge me, I&#39;m just like, myself.&quot; Said Jason, realising the whole reason why he is so happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I dunno about myself, I just kind of, learned to ignore everyone else once I realised that nothing I did would ever be good enough. So why not do whatever I wanted?&quot; Replied Sarah, explaining her own reasons to be the way she is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable. Thanks a lot for listening to me.&quot; Said Jason, earnestly believing that this has been a positive change.<br />
<br />
Jason and Sarah try to sleep again, still to no avail. Around what looked like 2AM, the two of them gave up and decided that it would be better to talk to someone.  After some small discussion, they decide that Dr. Joan might be the better choice.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a telephone rings loudly in Joan&#39;s room, waking her up from a very nice dream. <br />
<br />
&quot;This better be important, because it is not everyday that I get to dream about my darling Arcene.&quot; She mumbles on her way to the phone, upset that someone just stopped the galant Arsene Lupin from romancing her in her dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerr, Dr. Joan, here is Jason, can we have a talk?&quot; Said Jason, trying to think of a reason why they would want to talk with Joan, other than just having someone to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jason, clearly, did something happen? I&#39;m going there ASAP.&quot; Said Joan, ranging the phone, thinking she has to probably take some notes of new delopments going on with her current object of study.<br />
<br />
In a few minutes, Dr. Joan arrives in the room, only picking a coat and sleepers alongside her equipment backpack for anything she might need. She knocks on the door and waits for the duo to open. After they openned the door, Joan is front faced with the relative towering duo, with Jason looking even more feminine, with ampler breasts and longuer hair, reaching his neck, alongside obviously fuller lips.<br />
<br />
The vision was sure something to see at night, she was sure that they look somehow taller than before, but shrugged it off as a trick of the angle, as Jason was 1,80 while she was 1,50.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, interesting looks like the changes are still happening. I guess your friend&#39;s visit was fruitful.&quot; Said Joan, connecting the new additions to the prior visit by Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but that is not exactly what we want to talk about.&quot; Said Jason and Sarah, in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it isn&#39;t, well, I&#39;m all ears darling, tell me anything you need.&quot; Said Joan, trying to understand what they needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is just, we don&#39;t know, we are just anxious about the future, not exactly about our current conditions, but what we will do after it is over, you can understand.&quot; Said Jason, trying to come up with words for his current state of spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand darling. Sometimes shakeups happen on our lives, and once we leave the rails of normalcy, we tend to latch to the first post light we can find. What lies beyond in that dark night is scary, but it is ours to find.&quot; Said Joan, showing some of her love of literature in her words, trying to assuade Jason&#39;s worries with her own experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, that is, suprisingly deep, where did you take that from, Doctor?&quot; Asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can just call me Joan. And like, not from anywhere specific, it is just, something I thought for my own journey to here.&quot; Said Joan, introspecting a little. &quot;Like, you might not know, but we are all marvels of medical science in here, well, I&#39;m outdated by our current standards, but I&#39;m still someone that could only be myself thanks to medical intervention.&quot; Said Joan, now showing a mix of nostalgia and pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing Joan, so that is why you work here?&quot; Asked Jason, now interested on her story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, mostly, to help people like. So it makes me happy that you are taking it well, just know that what you two are doing for us is going to help millions more, for sure.&quot; Replied Joan, being polite, not wanting to take too much credit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we have been thinking about it a lot, and it is one of those things that really helped us deal with this whole thing.&quot; Said Jason, feeling more self assured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Joan, I&#39;m curious about one thing. Do you find us beautiful.&quot; Said Sarah, completely changing the mood of the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Sarah?&quot; Said Jason, surprised by the sudden question.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Like, I see how much you are thinking about your appearance, and it isn&#39;t like Mike counts, he is literally wired to not find us strange, remember, c&#39;mon, it isn&#39;t like you are haven&#39;t been curious about it too.&quot; Said Sarah, raising a good point.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well, I, I do find you two gorgeous to be honest, I can&#39;t say that I never fantasized about you.&quot; Replied Joan, avoiding some eye contact while her cheecks get rosy from.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well, thanks a lot Joan, I-I really do find you attractive too.&quot; Replies Jason, being polite, but also, curious about where this is going, since he indeed found her attractive.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-o-oh really? Oh where do I hide my face now, you two are making me blush too hard.&quot; Said Joan, getting completely flustered from hearing the compliment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Joan, tell us, what kind of fantasies did you have about us.&quot; Said Sarah, moving Jason&#39;s leg without him realising to get more comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, t-t-those fantasies where, umm...er...&quot; Said Joan, now completely out of words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sexual weren&#39;t them.&quot; Said Sarah, provoking her now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-y-yes!&quot; Said Joan, only mustering the courage to say the single word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait really?&quot; Said Jason, now getting interested on the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I have good new for you so, Jay here honestly has been having similar thoughts about to too.&quot; Said Sarah, knowing extremely well how Jason&#39;s body changes when he is excited by this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-f-f-for real?&quot; Said Joan, now finally looking at Jason&#39;s eyes again, and seeing his honest desire in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I thought you didn&#39;t like women Sarah?&quot; Said Jason, curious about what she wants to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look big guy, you don&#39;t knock it until you try it, you know. You took one for the team, so nothing is fairer than me taking one too.&quot; Replied Sarah, logicing her wait into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is fair.&quot; Replied Jason. &quot;And you Joan, what do you think?&quot; He said, looking directly at her now.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well, I would be willing to try.&quot; Replied Joan, letting her imagination run wild.<br />
<br />
Silent, Jason stands and moves towards Joan. With a delicate touch to her face, carasses her loose hair, and grabs her hand with one of his own while embracing her back with the other. Joan took this as an invitation to a dance, and the two valsed a little, with Joan humming a song for them to dance to.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how is it going?&quot; Asked Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dreamy.&quot; Replied Joan.<br />
<br />
Jason then pulled her closer and lifter Joan with his strong arms, pressing his breasts against hers, as he kisses her in the neck. Joan starts moaning as Jason moves up through her neck, into her face, up to her lips, where they finally kiss passionately.<br />
<br />
Sarah feels the surge of heat comming and walks Jason up to the wall, so he can have an easier time making out with her. Joan takes the cue and wraps her legs in their abdomen, leading Jason to press one of her buttcheecks with his hand.<br />
<br />
Sarah can feel Jason&#39;s desire and helps him, moving their monstrous penis into Joan&#39;s waiting pussy. The touch makes both Joan and Sarah moan loudly, but Jason is too concentrated in the make out to say a thing.<br />
<br />
Sarah moves their hips, contracting their penis, to make it shorter but thicker, and trusting on Joan, taking care not to hurt her. Joan just embraces Jason&#39;s neck and kisses him all of his face. Jason finally starts moaning loudly, moving his head back so that Joan can kiss it all over.<br />
<br />
After a while, the thundering climax take the three of them, Joan stabing her fingernails on Jason&#39;s and Sarah&#39;s skin, but they don&#39;t care, they leat the energy take the moment and can even extract some pleasure from the pain.<br />
<br />
Joan after a few second comes back to her senses as she finally loosens her grip. With a certain thankfulness in her eyes, cohoborated by the thankfulness seen in Jason&#39;s eyes. He finally lowers her, and after taking another shower, the 3 give their goodbyes and Joan leaves for the night. Jason and Sarah finally rest well, feeling their emitions where finally put to rest with a nice answer.</p>
