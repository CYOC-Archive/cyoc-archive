<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three took turns showering once they got back, Hank first so he could start cooking dinner. The man was a great cook, at least as far as Danny&#39;s memories told Jason, so he entertained his nephew while Hank worked. The two men were avoiding each other&#39;s gazes, which seemed to upset the young one asking them if they had a fight. A quick reassurance and a little lessening of the awkwardness let them get through dinner and Hank went up to put Christopher to bed.<br />
<br />
Danny got up to do the dishes, which he always did on nights Hank cooked. Which was most nights. After four years living together they had their rhythms down. Hank came down and leaned against the counter. Danny always seemed to forget Hank was bigger than him, just because he wasn&#39;t as cut, the man had a lot of muscle hidden in there. He didn&#39;t know why it seemed to surprise him, they had worked out often enough and Hank always had to up the weights on his turns, but it did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we talk now?&quot; Hank asked, still not looking directly at Danny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris might hear.&quot; It was a reflexive avoidance, Jason was just letting the instincts from the part of him that was Danny take control.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s so worn out he passed out before I finished the first page of his story. He wouldn&#39;t wake up to a jackhammer.&quot; Hank smiled, nudging Danny a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I still have the same problems, you&#39;re my sis&#39; ex, and you&#39;ve never shown interest in men before. We have a good thing, why ruin it?&quot; Danny set the plates on the drying rack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna&#39;s not coming back. You know that as much as I do. Besides, I don&#39;t want her back. And why couldn&#39;t I be into men? People come to that realization later in life all the time, maybe I&#39;m bi, maybe it&#39;s just you. All I know is no date I have measures up. You&#39;re good with my son, you put up with me.&quot; Hank reached out and grabbed one of Danny&#39;s hands, giving it a squeeze. &quot;I find myself excited to see you, more than just excited sometimes. If you tell me no, I&#39;ll back off. But think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason wondered at the fact that he kept ending up in weird situations for his day. What would someone in his shoes go through? School? A math test? It hardly seemed even. But he had picked shoes both from men who got nervous and ran, he wasn&#39;t running, but he wanted... well.. was this it?<br />
<br />
He knew what Danny wanted. What he was too scared to actually do. When was the last time Danny had a date, or even sex. For someone as good looking as him it had been.. Jason had to focus. A year? A year! Because, well, Hank was the one he wanted. Jason could dig that desire out where Danny had been too afraid of it.<br />
<br />
Danny leaned in and kissed Hank. It was like opening the flood gates. Their mouths locked together, tongues eagerly exploring. The scratching of Hank&#39;s beard on his stubble was electric. Years of pent up attraction and frustration were suddenly let loose. Danny found his back up against the wall, Hank pinning him in place with his larger body, giving him only moments to breathe as the continued kissing.<br />
<br />
When it finally broke, Hank looked at Danny. &quot;Bedroom?&quot; Danny just nodded.<br />
<br />
They both went up the stairs to Hank&#39;s room. As soon as he was inside, Hank pounced on him and started pulling off clothes, from Danny, from himself, it didn&#39;t seem to matter as long as they were all gone. Hank&#39;s cock was shorter than Danny&#39;s but looked thicker. But it stood out rock hard, already drooling pre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, Hank. When was the last time you got laid?&quot; Danny meant it as a joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four years.&quot; He answered between kisses on Danny&#39;s neck. &quot;Because this is what I wanted.&quot; Danny was pushed back on the bed and Hank pinned him down for a moment, reaching to grab something off the nightstand. He took the advantage as Hank was reaching over him to take one of the man&#39;s nipples in his mouth, tweaking it between his teeth. &quot;Oh fuck..&quot; Was the only response.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Danny felt something cool and wet exploring between his cheeks, seeking out his hole. He gasped as two thick lubed up fingers dipped inside him. &quot;You brought lube?&quot; He asked, a little bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hoped this was finally the time.&quot; Hank said unapologetically. <br />
<br />
Jason shivered at the feeling inside of Danny. First a complete top in Rusty, now he was on the other side of the equation, wanting to be penetrated. They made out as Hank lubed him up.<br />
<br />
Hank got off of him and stood at the foot of the bed for a moment, obviously admiring the man laying in front of him as he lubed up his own cock. Danny spread his legs with little prompting. Hank lined himself up and thrust inside him. Danny winced a little. He could teach Hank some things later, like taking it slow, but for now he just wanted the man.<br />
<br />
The initial pain faded into pleasure as Hank got into the rhythm of his thrusts. Hands holding Danny&#39;s legs up on his shoulders. Surprisingly, Danny came first, moaning deeply as he shot his load across his stomach and chest. Then he felt warmth flooding into him, the cock twitching in his ass.<br />
<br />
A moment later, Hank fell on the bed next to Danny, eyeing the mess on the other man&#39;s chest curiously. Then, leaned over and licked him clean. Danny shivered a little at the feeling of Hank&#39;s tongue on his skin. He certainly wasn&#39;t shy about trying things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I ever tell you,&quot; Hank started when he finished and laid back down next to Danny. &quot;I love it when you let your hair grow out between shoots.&quot; He was running his hand over Danny&#39;s chest and nipples, feeling the stubble just starting to come in. &quot;I think it looks good on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll try letting it fill in then.&quot; Danny replied, his own fingers resting on Hank&#39;s furry chest. &quot;Chest hair is making a comeback, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
They curled up together for the night, spending time talking and getting used to having their bodies pressed up against each other. It was surprising how quickly it felt natural and right.<br />
<br />
Danny woke up still laying in bed. Hank was out, probably taking care of Christopher who was an early riser. He squinted at the clock on the nightstand. It was almost ten. Hank had decided to let him sleep in. Danny smiled slightly and got to his feet. He found his underwear and plodded towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He stepped through the door and right into the shoe store. He felt the sandals on his feet again but that was the only clothing that returned. He was standing in the store in his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice night?&quot; The clerk asked with a smirk. Polishing a pair of oddly familiar looking shoes on the counter.<br />
<br />
Jason had that moment of disorientation where he returned to being completely him. &quot;I&#39;m beginning to question if I&#39;m really straight. I keep ending up with men.&quot; He answered honestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just means your orientation isn&#39;t a strong enough part of your identity for it to hold.&quot; The clerk shrugged. &quot;I find it odd to discriminate anyway. You&#39;re smiling though. That must have been a good one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was.&quot; Jason nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;A keeper?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason actually put his hand on the door. Part of him wanted desperately to go back. &quot;If you go back, that&#39;s your life now.&quot; The clerk said, setting the shoes he had been cleaning aside. &quot;Do what you feel is right.&quot;</p>
