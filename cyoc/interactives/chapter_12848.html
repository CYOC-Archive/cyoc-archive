<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"Hehe, Roger, think of it dude, a minute ago you were big man on campus,and now you're just a dumb jock--no Ogre is a dumb jock, you're just an article of clothing.&nbsp; I can hardly wait to put you on, but first I need to tie up some loose ends, so people won't come looking for me, after I become you!"&nbsp; John said gleefully.</P>
<P>"I'll just store you in your own locker for safe-keeping, until I'm ready to change. Don't worry about telling me your combonation, I brought my own lock."</P>
<P>Roger was mortified.&nbsp; He was mute, and helpless. The metal locker clanked open and he was unceremonious tossed on top of his recently disgarded smelly socks.&nbsp; The gym locker reeked of stale sweat.&nbsp; The light faded as the locker slammed shut.</P>
<P>He heard retreating footsteps and then he heard heavier ones approach.&nbsp; There was the scraping of metal against metal and then the sound of a lock opening.&nbsp; A tall man in an institutional green uniform stood there with a lock and a ring of keys in his hands.&nbsp; He had a 5 o'clock shadow, and his hair was unkempt.&nbsp; He was probably in his mid 20's.&nbsp; He smiled as as his grimy hand reached in and picked Roger up. Carefully, the janitor laid a jockstrap from the lost and found in Roger's place.&nbsp; Then he noticed the Talisman dangling from a hook in the locker where John had hung it. He undid the knot, causing the talisman to drop onto the jockstrap.&nbsp; He smiled.&nbsp; John would probably assume that his spell had been ruined by the Talisman.&nbsp; Hopefully, that would buy Hank Coombs some time to effect his transformation into Roger, and to deal with John.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Henry "Hank" Coombs had been a student at Stonewood ten years earlier, when he was unexpectedly orphaned and impoverished at the same time.&nbsp; He had never completed his studies, but had gotten a job at the school as a janitor to survive.&nbsp; He pursued his interest in magic vicariously through the students.&nbsp; He had found an invisibility cloak, and thanks to having master keys to all the locks on campus, he could go and borrow any book or supply to read or use.&nbsp; He had been in the next row of lockers under his invisibility cloak reading another student's Applied Temporal Spellbook, when the row between John and Roger had begun.&nbsp;Now Hank could be&nbsp;a student&nbsp;again, and not just anyone, but a rich and powerful one.&nbsp; Only one person he knew of could ruin his opportunity, and that person was John.&nbsp; He had to be dealt with.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>If John had transformed the Dean into an inflatable sex toy for use at a frat party, that would be grounds for getting John permanently inanimated.&nbsp; The other missing students and faculty were just gravy.&nbsp; No, thought Hank, I should start with the furniture.&nbsp; After all it is all supposed to be inventoried, and it's more plausible that he as a janitor would discover that transformation.&nbsp; Otherwise, John would suspect he had Roger.</P>
<P>The Chancellor had sent a request to maintenance to replace one of his chairs, and it was the same type as use in the dorms.&nbsp; Since each room was supposed to have one, and John had two, it was logical that the janitor would take one of those for the Chancellor's office.&nbsp; Hank headed to John's rooms.</P>
<P>John brushed passed him as he entered the dormitory.&nbsp; Apparently, John had already run to his rooms, and done what he needed to implement his plan, not knowing that Roger had already been purloined and he was about to be thwarted.&nbsp; Hank pulled a wand from his pocket and waved it over each chair.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp; He then waved it again uttering the word "Voila" and instantly the rug, desk, both chairs, and probably a dozen other objects in the room began to glow.&nbsp; Hank swallowed hard.&nbsp; John had to be a very powerful magician indeed.&nbsp; "Fine" said Hank, and the glow faded.&nbsp; Luck was with him, as he stepped from the room, he nearly bumped into Professor Farfeather, one of his old instructors.</P>
<P>"Oh, Professor Farfeather, could you step in here for a moment?" Hank asked.</P>
<P>Farfeather looked confused, "If it's a maintenance issue, you should talk to the administration...," he began.</P>
<P>Hank whispered, "Unethical magical practices by a student, I think?" He nodded knowingly.</P>
<P>"What? Show me!"&nbsp; Farfeather was&nbsp;in charge of Academic Standards and Integrity at Stonewood.</P>
<P>Hank showed Farfeather John's rooms, and did his demonstration with his wand.</P>
<P>Farfeather was visibily upset. "So many transformed?&nbsp; The missing students, and perhaps the dean?" Then he turned to the janitor, and asked suspiciously, "Where did you get that wand?&nbsp; And how did you know to use that spell?" he demanded.</P>
<P>"Well, professor, I learnt that spell in your class, before misfortune compelled me to leave school.&nbsp; I was able to get a job here in the maintenance department, and the wand is my&nbsp;old school one, it comes in handy, for unglamoring things. Not very powerful in its own right.&nbsp; The Chancellor requested a chair, and I remembered seeing two here, and there's only supposed to be one.&nbsp; And chairs have the same inventory number, so I suspected a changling spell.&nbsp; I didn't expect the whole room to light up like a birthday cake."</P>
<P>"Well, I'm glad you came to me.&nbsp; If you'd confronted the boy, there's no telling what he might have done. John-tch, tch, I never thought he was this powerful..."</P>
<P>"Perhaps he took the powers of those he transformed?" Hank suggested.</P>
<P>"Oh, my. I shall convene a circle at once."</P>
<P>______________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>Meanwhile at the frat, the party was just getting under way.&nbsp; Ogre came up to John, and asked, "Where's Roger?"&nbsp; They stood watching as a couple pledges demonstrated their love-making technique with the rubberized Dean.</P>
<P>"Roger?&nbsp; Last time I saw him, he was with you.&nbsp; I haven't seen him since.&nbsp; Perhaps he's with a real girl?&nbsp; I'm sure he'll show up later," John shrugged.</P>
<P>"Hmmmm."&nbsp; Ogre seemed lost in thought.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, as soon as John had paid his dues, he would cut out, and head over to Roger's locker.&nbsp; Then he would transform into Roger, and come back to assume his new role as president of the frat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
