<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kesha was panting as she ran down the hall with her heavy math books and her backpack in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn it! I'm late for my first period class again! And now I have to haul these huge books around. Why are math textbooks so big and bulky?&quot; she wondered, as she slowed down when she came within three flights of stairs.<br />
<br />
As soon as her foot landed on the first step, she felt that she had lost her balance. The books went flying through the air, as the slender, African American girl tumbled down the stairs and crashed on to the tiled floor.<br />
<br />
Jason had just walked around the corner when he found the girl lying on the floor. He ran towards her to see if she was alright. Luckily she was just a little dazed, and she hadn't broken anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay, Kesha?&quot; the boy asked her, as he extended his hand. She grabbed hold of him and he gently helped her back on to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Jason. I was running because I was late for class...&quot; she said to him, while Jason bent down and picked up her two math books which were on the floor. He was about to hand her the books, when he heard a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! Get away from her, you fag! That's MY girl!&quot; Tyrone yelled at him. He immediately ran towards Kesha and asked her if she was alright.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I did was help her get up and I picked up her books that she dropped when she fell from the stairs! I didn't touch her, Tyrone...&quot; Jason said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay away from her, you idiot! DON'T TOUCH MY GIRL!!&quot; Tyrone shouted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I DIDN'T TOUCH HER!&quot; Jason shouted back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyrone, will you STOP BEING SO JEALOUS?&quot; Kesha said to Tyrone, which made him even angrier at Jason. Tyrone made a fist with his right hand as he marched towards Jason, ready to punch him in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll show you... You TOUCHED MY GIRL!&quot; he shouted at Jason.<br />
<br />
Jason was about to turn around and walk away, when he heard a familiar voice speak inside of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now, Jason... You don't need to run away from Kesha's jealous boyfriend! I will help you stand up to Tyrone, because you didn't do anything to hurt Kesha!&quot; Ty's voice rang inside of his head.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jason's legs were frozen. He couldn't move! This made him panic for a moment, for Tyrone was charging at him with his fist. <br />
<br />
Then Jason began to grow bigger and taller... FAST! His quads became really huge and thick, his abs suddenly turned hard as rock, his pecs inflated and expanded like balloon, along with his biceps, forearms, and shoulders. Jason grew a foot taller, his pecs ripped the buttons of his shirt, his arms ripped the sleeves, and his quads and calves tore his jeans at the seams. Jason was hulking out of his clothes and rapidly grew into a 9-foot muscle monster!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Jason, just growl at him!&quot; Ty said to Jason. In the meantime, Kesha gasped in amazement, as Tyrone crashed with his fist into Jason's huge, mighty abs. <br />
<br />
&quot;YEEEEOOOUAAUUUWWW&quot; he screamed, for his hand felt like he had punched a brick wall! <br />
<br />
Then when Tyrone looked straight ahead of him, he realized that Jason was not quite the same as he had been just a few seconds ago... Tyrone was looking right at Jason's wall of rock hard abs. Tyrone gasped as he tilted his head up, to realize that Jason had grown over three feet taller than him!<br />
<br />
Just then Jason smiled at him, opened his mouth, he took a deep breath, and he let out a mighty roar! <br />
<br />
&quot;GGGGRRRROOOOOOOOWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!&quot; he roared, making Tyrone lose his balance and fall with his back on the floor, just a few feet in front of Jason's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Jay, blow him away!&quot; Ty whispered inside of Jason's head. Jason then took a deep breath and exhaled, blowing Tyrone with such a hurricane-force wind, making the boy slide almost 15 feet down the hard tiled floor! When Tyrone's body stopped sliding over the floor, he got up and ran out of the building, screaming in fear!<br />
<br />
Jason and Kesha both laughed it up, as Jason's body slowly began to shrink back to its normal size. When Jason looked like normal again and his huge muscles had shrunk back to his original size, his ripped shirt and jeans were suddenly restored as well.  <br />
<br />
Kesha was completely amazed by the whole thing, but Ty made her feel like it was nothing at all and that she did not have to be afraid of Jason. <br />
<br />
Then both Jason and Kesha held hands as they walked over to their math class. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Ty!&quot; Jason thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome, Jay&quot; Ty responded, in a voice that was only heard by Ty’s friend Jason.</p>
