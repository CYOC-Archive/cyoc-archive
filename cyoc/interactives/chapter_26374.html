<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kurt shouldn't have been so hard on Andrew. The next week went very well for him. His team won the soccer tournament and he still went with Brittany to the dance. However Brittany was coming over very regularly and kept asking to see Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just feel so bad at how I acted, Kurt I didn't know it was medical I just thought...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's fine, he could actually go get a job...but he is just such a lazy ass, can't even change his own diapers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurt he's your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brittany you don't know what it is like, my mom is at his beck and call throughout the day. You know if could change his pants by himself and got some of those huge heavy duty diapers-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurt they are already huge,&quot; said Brittany.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he got those heavy duty diapers,&quot; Kurt continued, &quot;He could go get a job in retail or something. You know you are one of the first people I brought over in a long time because I am scared at how they'll view my brother and if they think something will be wrong with me,&quot; said Kurt and the two got to his house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know there is nothing wrong with you,&quot; said Brittany, &quot;And don't be so hard on him. Can you imagine not going out and being stuck in diapers all day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you want to come inside, we can go over that science homework,&quot; said Kurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't,&quot; said Brittany, &quot;I am going to the mall with Shelly, I'll call you tonight though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurt nodded and went inside. He headed to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a second Kurt,&quot; said his mom, &quot;I am training your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your still trying to potty train Andrew, aren't you like 18 years behind,&quot; said Kurt.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Andrew walked out to his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll try later we'll get this,&quot; she said to him and looked at Kurt, &quot;Why all of a sudden are you so nasty about all of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just saying what I've been thinking these past couple of years,&quot; said Kurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother is 6 years older then you, you should give him more respect,&quot; said his mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am lightyears ahead of him with holding my bladder, thanks mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, &quot;I have to run some errands can you just not fight with him until Mike gets home from his practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Kurt, &quot;Just as long as I don't need to change his pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurt and Andrew's mom left leaving Kurt to finally take his plan into action.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew can you help Mike and me bring in some groceries?&quot; he yelled from outside.<br />
<br />
Andrew trudged out. Most of his clothes were the short shorts and the plain t-shirts. His mom thought they were the easiest to take off and the easiest to clean.<br />
<br />
Andrew came outside and Kurt jumped out from a bush blocking Andrew from the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Mike?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurt ripped off his shirt and his shorts causing Andrew to stand with just his diaper in the front yard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurt what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Throwing you out into the real world,&quot; said Kurt and closed the door. Andrew tried to open it. It was locked. He ran to the side to find the garage locked. He then ran around the back to find the backdoor locked as well.<br />
<br />
He stayed in the backyard at least they had a fence, he just hoped no one would come outside. After staying outside for a moments he found himself having to poop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Andrew feeling his body squat as he began to poop in his pants. Like most of his poops it was unformed and mushy and weighed down his diaper. He could feel as more oozed out and filled up his pants.<br />
<br />
Andrew sat down on some of the yard furniture feeling the poop hit against his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you punish him, he is making this torture worse,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the magician appeared, &quot;Hmm I see a big stinky baby in front of me. Not a nice look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew was very embarrassed as he sat there with his huge poopy diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like something needs a change around here,&quot; he said, &quot;But I won't be changing you quite yet, I love how pitiful you are right now, but I think Kurt needs a bit of an attitude adjustment.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of a sudden Kurt appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? What is going on?&quot; said Kurt, &quot;How am I outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurt looked back between Andrew and the magician.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew you had an accident again, of course, and who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a magician per se,&quot; said the magician.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; said Kurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't believe me?&quot; asked the magician.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm interesting,&quot; said the magician and pointed his finger at Kurt.<br />
<br />
Kurt started to shrink, his body began to get smaller and smaller and his clothes fell off. He was getting younger. With each passing second he was losing a few months of his life. His hair grew a little longer and he started to get some baby fat. Then some pull ups formed around his crotch along with a dark blue shirt with a train on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurt you'll now be needing some training as well, and it looks like anything you were doing with Brittany is about to end because pretty soon Brittany will be changing your pants when you have an accident not playing with whats inside of them. And I'll let you keep your 14 year old brain because it only makes it more torturous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurt began to cry and the magician disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on down here?&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew turned around, it was Mike, &quot;Andrew what happened to your clothes? And why did you bring Kurt outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We got locked out,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come inside now,&quot; said Mike sternly as he picked up the 2 year old and bawling Kurt.<br />
<br />
The headed inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew I'm in a rush, Brittany is going to be here soon to watch Kurt and help you out in any way, can you be okay without changing your diaper for like 20 minutes? And please don't go outside again, and I thought you were scared of people seeing you in diapers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike placed Kurt in a playpen and looked at Andrew, &quot;Ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; said Andrew.</p>
