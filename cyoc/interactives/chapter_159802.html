<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With her mother gone, Amy breathed a sigh of relief. Now she wouldn&#39;t have to worry about explaining why she was &quot;wearing&quot; a skin tight latex suit to anyone. At least, not for some hours. She walked in front of the mirror in her room and took a thorough look at her body. She concluded by the sight that it was indeed her pajamas which had turned into what was now the latex part of her skin. &quot;Everything was connected to the socks.&quot; she thought to herself and got an idea.<br />
She pulled out some short gloves and put them on. Seemingly nothing happened. &quot;So it&#39;s only when its connected.&quot; she mused to herself. But her conclusion came too quickly as she could feel her hands tingle, followed by a burning sensation as the glove turned into the same black as her body and fused with her skin. &quot;Okay, what the hell?&quot; she asked her feet as if she expected the magical latex to respond. Then she apparently got one, as she suddenly knew why it happened. &quot;Great, so you come with a magical users manual as well?&quot; she said out loud. &quot;Just beaming the answer into my brain?&quot; She would find it stupid, but she was in a situation where, whatever she put on would turn into latex and fuse with her body. It being able to give her some answers were at the very least considerate. &quot;So... Anything else I need to know?&quot; she said, and as she did, she had all the information she needed.<br />
<br />
Amy quickly reviewed what the magical latex had &quot;told&quot; her. It wasn&#39;t only clothes, but powders and creams could also be used. Furthermore, the process was automatic until she had been fully turned into latex. She also learned that any changes to her was &quot;saved&quot; and she could go between different forms or sizes if she wanted. However, it only worked once she had been fully turned to latex, however, even if she reverted a change into something from before she turned, such as her original breast size, it would still be latex. She was destined to remain a latex being for however long she would live.<br />
Then there was her senses. Pain would be almost gone, as the latex apparently made her incredibly durable, but her overall sense of touch would increase. Meanwhile, she could have her eyes and ears removed, but would still be able to hear and see perfectly fine, with both senses being stationed at seemingly appropriate places. Lose the ears, and she would still hear from where they would be, lose her head through the latex transformation and her sight would go to her tits, and her hearing to her shoulders. Actually lose her head, and she would be a helpless latex head. Atop on that, if she didn&#39;t have any eyelids, or something that worked as eyelids, she would be unable to close her eyes. Lastly, her sense of taste would be enhanced and slightly modified so she would be bothered by tasting latex all the time, and her sense of smell would be completely gone.<br />
What would also be gone would be most of what is used to qualify something as living once the transformation was done. She would not be hungry, nor need to eat or drink anything. She had no need to sleep and would never be tired. Her breathing would be replaced with a sort of inflation system. She would be able to gather or expel air from inside her, making it so she could turn her completely hollow inside, or be completely filled with latex. The only hollow parts inside her would be things like her mouth to just slightly down the throat, part of the ear channel or the insides of her pussy. Of course, if she managed to get some, other openings would also be hollowed out, and if she removed her mouth, there wouldn&#39;t be a weird air bubble inside.<br />
Speaking of her mouth, she would permanently be mute once the propper parts had turned to latex. She was a bit saddened that her voice would be gone forever, but in the long run, she thought it was worth the price for becoming what she would become. <br />
Her situation had made her slightly horny. For some months now, she had this fantasy of turning into latex. It had started when she was looking through NSFW stuff, where she encountered a video of a woman who was putting on some kind of latex fetish suit. She had found it so hot, especially with how the suit almost looked like one connected suit, as if it was how the woman actually looked. That made her wonder what it would be if the woman became the suit instead of just wearing it, and that had turned her on even more. Every time her brain touched on the idea for the shortest of moments, she was turned on. Now she had the chance to actually do it.<br />
Though she kinda also want to show Lina that the socks were magical, and now they were turning her into some latex human thing. That made her go through other friends she might show this off to, because it would be more fun having someone else be there when she turned. What to do...</p>
