<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric and Clyde realized a little too late they had thrown a wrench in their own plans. The day meant to be spent practicing for tryouts was instead taken up with a very different kind of workout. Worse, that morning he could find hide nor hair of his brother for a little reassurance before he went to tryouts, he would be able to be there, only the candidates and current team members were allowed to keep distraction to a minimum, but at least Clyde was watching from the sidelines.<br />
<br />
As he ran, four hooves pounding against the air as his magic pushed him forward, he could feel the stares of not only the eight reindeer below watching, but those of the five behind him, Bix&#39;s glare from the sidelines was particularly hot. He had had just enough time before tryouts for Clyde to teach him how to become four-legged. Since they&#39;d be pulling the sleigh that way, the candidates had to prove themselves in that form.<br />
<br />
Upon arrival, he was the last candidate to show, the other hopefuls all gave him a cold shoulder, except Tag, of course, who almost squeezed the life out of him in a bone crushing bear hug, and asking which would have him as their best man at the wedding. He was introduced to the other team members but in his stress at what was coming up could barely remember their names.<br />
<br />
The tryouts had actually gone well for him so far. The flying portion, which was really more of an aerial acrobatics test, dodging fake chimneys and geese, going through hoops, and landing and taking off from platforms had been a nasty first test. Somehow he had pulled out second on that one with Tag in a close third. The winner, a tall and lanky reindeer named Eino had given them both a rather smug look. Fortunately he bombed the next one, the strength competition in which Tag had outshined everyone, but Eric had surprised himself with a respectable middle placement in third. Second place had still gotten it despite his nose being bruised from running into more than one obstacle on the previous test.<br />
<br />
Apparently, they used some sort of ranking system based on each placement to determine who was in the lead. If he had his math right, Tag was in first place and he was in second. But they were only one point apart. If he could get first and Tag got third he was in. Maybe even if he got second, but he wouldn&#39;t count on Tag being fourth, that would just tie them.<br />
<br />
Eric dared a look over his shoulder as he ran for his life, a streak of light shooting across the night sky. Tag was almost right on his heels, and was wearing one of his happiest grins. He was actually enjoying having the competition. Somehow, that pushed Eric on. Tag was gaining on him, Eric might have put too much energy in at the start to get a lead, but as they shot across the finished Tag&#39;s nose was only at Eric&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
It was not a graceful landing, and he stumbled a bit. Tag came running up and headbutted him, their antlers clanking together. &quot;Awesome run, jäbä.&quot; Clyde came walking up with a pair of shorts, Bix did the same for Tag. They both changed back to their two legged shapes and dressed quickly. The other candidates being handled by one of their sponsors.<br />
<br />
Clyde hugged him once he had the shorts buttoned. &quot;That was one of the most amazing tryouts I&#39;ve seen. You guys were great, both of you. No one else was even close in the speed test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you got rid of that stupid collar.&quot; Came a gruff voice from off to Eric&#39;s side. He looked over at Bix, though the buck&#39;s expression was more considering than hostile. &quot;So you really are going to join our tribe? Not just some human posturing?&quot; At Eric&#39;s nod he stuck out a hand. &quot;You&#39;re not bad, lapsi. Maybe Tag wouldn&#39;t be so full of himself if you were around to give him that sort of competition from the start.&quot; Tag snorted. &quot;I still don&#39;t completely trust you, but I&#39;ll give you a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric took the offered hand and gave it a firm shake. &quot;Anyway.&quot; Bix continued. &quot;Its out of our hooves now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Eric asked, looking between the other three.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Tag are tied.&quot; Clyde said, sounding more than a little proud. &quot;So it&#39;s up to the boss to pick which joins the team.&quot;  Eric slid his gaze over to Rudy. &quot;Not the captain, the boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rudy! What have you got for me?!&quot; A bombastic voice called from the door to the workshop. &quot;Got the message that trials were done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There he is.&quot; Clyde said quietly for Eric&#39;s ears alone. Eric would have been able to pick out the man standing in the doorway as Santa if he had been wearing cargo shorts and a Gold&#39;s Gym tank top. As it was the man wasn&#39;t wearing his red getup either. The tan trousers with the red and white plaid shirt still looked right on him. And that mane of white hair and long beard also seemed right on the money. He wasn&#39;t as fat as the stories portrayed him. He did have a gut, but there was something distinctly solid about him. An older man, still strong and fit, unbent by the age he carried. The pipe that hung from his mouth trailed soft wispy smoke and filled the area with a peppermint smell.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who&#39;s our winner?&quot; He stepped over to look at the clipboard in Rudy&#39;s hand. &quot;A tie?! Saints, man, this is the first tie in a century. Tag, as expected and, ah, I see. This is the young buck we spoke about, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rudy nodded. &quot;It is, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; His tone was level and even as he looked out at the assorted reindeer. &quot;Tag, Eric, front and center.&quot; Tag was almost eager in bounding up to stand in front of Santa, Eric was a little more reserved, but wasn&#39;t about to take his time. Santa looked between the two of them, those blue eyes feeling like they locked Eric in place and saw everything. He hadn&#39;t expected Santa to be, well, intimidating.<br />
<br />
He stepped up to Tag and placed a hand on his forehead. Something seemed to pass between them though both were quiet. Tag glanced at him then back. Still no words, but it was obvious they were in conversation. Eventually Santa lifted his hand and stepped over. He reached out and Eric resisted an urge to flinch, but when the hand settled on him he felt warm, safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric. Eric Laine. Yes. I remember you. Good kid. In fact you&#39;ve made the nice list every year, eighteen Christmases running.&quot; Santa&#39;s voice was softer in his mind than the booming voice he spoke in. &quot;Are you sure this is what you want? Not joining the team, I mean. I can see you want something more. You want to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s eyes flicked to Clyde, then back to Santa. &quot;I love him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I can see it all there in your mind. You&#39;re practically screaming it.&quot; Santa chuckled, though it came out from his mouth, not by the thought link. &quot;You have my blessing to stay.&quot; Eric had to physically restrain himself from hugging the man. &quot;Now, about the team. Do you want the spot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I&#39;d be an idiot to turn it down, but..&quot; He looked at Tag. &quot;It&#39;s more his dream than mine, I just want to stay for now. I can wait for the next spot. Let Tag have it.&quot; Belatedly. &quot;Sir.&quot; Santa shook his head with a bright smile as he lifted his hand and stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are not making my job easy. Not only a tie, but each of you offering it to the other.&quot; Santa snorted as he stepped back.<br />
<br />
Eric looked over to Tag. &quot;Why would you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can stay. Why would you?&quot; Tag hissed softly back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want this more.&quot; Eric responded, but Tag looked doubtful. He caught Bix looking at them from the corner of his eye. At his son in astonishment, at Eric with, well, Eric couldn&#39;t describe the look but he thought Bix would be a friend from now on. Clyde took a step in his direction but Santa held up a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all. I&#39;ve given Eric permission to stay. As long as your elders accept him into the tribe, which I don&#39;t think will be an issue with my backing, he&#39;s here to stay.&quot; Santa gave Clyde a bit of a look as a whoop escaped him, but grinned. &quot;Second, I have two fine candidates to choose from, and after what they both did, I know either would be a perfect fit. So I&#39;m not going to pick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rudy blinked and looked down at his clipboard. Then up at Santa. &quot;But, we don&#39;t have the space.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aksel, either you tell him or I will.&quot; Santa said as he looked to the line of reindeer watching from the side.<br />
<br />
An older gray muzzled reindeer gave Santa a nod, then looked to Rudy. &quot;Sorry, this isn&#39;t easy. I thought I had one more Christmas Eve run in me, I was going to retire after this one, but,&quot; He shook his head. &quot;The doc advised against it. So I&#39;m going to retire. It&#39;s time for the young bucks to have their turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go.&quot; Santa said as if the matter was settled, and since it was his choice it probably was. &quot;Two open spots, two perfectly good candidates. Get them started on team practices, tomorrow, I&#39;m already nervous enough with how long we put this off. I want not a hitch on the big day. Now where did I put that list?&quot; Santa muttered as he patted his pockets, stepping back into the workshop.<br />
<br />
Eric was still staring after Santa as a pair of arms pulled him into a hug. Not Clyde&#39;s, but Tag&#39;s. &quot;Jäbä, you really told him to give it to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, we&#39;re friends aren&#39;t we? You&#39;ve wanted this a lot longer than me, I could wait.&quot; Eric gasped as Tag made his ribs creak again. &quot;Ahg! Air!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anteeksi.&quot; Tag dropped Eric from his grip, only to get his own dose of bone crushing from Bix.<br />
<br />
Clyde got to Eric before anyone else had a chance. &quot;I think we need to spend some time celebrating.&quot; He said with a laugh, leaning his forehead against Eric&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you two need to do is make sure you&#39;re cleaned up and ready for tonight. You, too, Tag.&quot; Rudy said as he stepped over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, the dinner.&quot; Clyde said, looking back at the work shop. Bix just nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner?&quot; Eric asked, every time he thought he had a handle on things, but Tag looked just as confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tradition. When a new buck joins the team, them and their sponsor gets to have dinner with the Clauses, and me and Clara will be there, too, but that&#39;s less exciting. Tomorrow night is the team dinner, where we officially welcome you on board.&quot; Rudy looked at a pocket watch that hung from his clipboard. &quot;You have a several hours, yet. But be back to the workshop by 8pm, better make it 7:45 so you&#39;re not late. I&#39;ve got paperwork to file. Three times as much as I expected, two new hires and a retirement.&quot; He snorted.<br />
<br />
Rudy wandered back towards the workshop, as Eric turned to Clyde. &quot;Several hours? Sounds like enough time for a celebration or two. But I need to let Tom know, he&#39;s going to be so excited. If I can find him. Do we need formal wear? What is even formal wear for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde laughed, a deep and cheery one. When Eric looked at him, he grinned. &quot;You said us. You really are going to be here with me. I&#39;m still getting used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Tom reclined on the bed, stretched out as Lars played with the white fur that had sprouted from Tom&#39;s chest after their last &#39;ceremony&#39;. Tom was changing, but it was certainly taking it&#39;s time, he was completely fox from the waist down, as well as below the elbows. Above that he had whiskers and fox ears, and his brown hair had turned snow white, but the rest was still human. Other than Lars&#39; new favorite patch of fur to play with. At least it didn&#39;t seem to be affecting his height. He&#39;d stick out in the fox tribe that tall, but Eric was pretty much his height now, he didn&#39;t think he could stand being shorter than his little brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I said stretch it out till morning, I didn&#39;t mean until he sun finally comes back up in another month.&quot; Lars said with a bit of a grumpy tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
Tom sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not doing it on purpose. I&#39;m just..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having second thoughts?&quot; Lars said, his tone only a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Planning. You know I like to plan things out. You&#39;re the spontaneous one.&quot; Tom said it fondly, then let out a little gasp as he felt Lars&#39; hand on his cock, giving hit a teasing tug.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your plan, then?&quot; Lars was already wrapping a muzzle around Tom&#39;s cock though, teasing it expertly with his tongue.<br />
<br />
Tom squirmed, but still managed to explain. &quot;Well, your internet and such still needs an over..&quot; He gasped. &quot;Over haul. That&#39;s what the guys I work for do. Remote communications.&quot; He gripped Lars&#39; head fur as a particular lick made him twitch. &quot;You approach them, I sell you on the idea to get commission, you agree but ask to keep me on as on-site liaison and administrator.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lars lifted his head, Tom&#39;s cock flopping back down to his stomach. &quot;So they pay you to stay here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded. &quot;Well, the resort pays them to pay me to stay here. I get to keep the job I like, stay in a place I love, and be with the fox I love. You finally get consistent video streaming. It&#39;s a win all around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I like this plan.&quot; Lars moved up to kiss Tom, his face stretching out into a muzzle as they did so, then locked together into a more natural fox kiss. He lapped at Tom&#39;s nose as he straddled him. &quot;Now that that&#39;s fixed, let&#39;s get you a little more fur.&quot; Tom grinned and helped Lars guide himself back onto his waiting cock. &quot;And this time, knot me properly.&quot;</p>
