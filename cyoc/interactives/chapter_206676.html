<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I couldn&#39;t believe what I had just witnessed. I had just lost my best friend to a megalomaniac werewolf, watching him become a monster himself through a disturbing sex ritual. And the fact it was something programmed into the game was terrifying in and of itself. Yet I had the strangest feeling that I&#39;d witnessed something similar before... I slapped my face, trying to get back into focus. It was only a game, after all. These things happen, apparently, and you either go with the flow, or reset. It was just a game... And I had to keep playing.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, I was hidden and alone for the time being. Although I may not be for much longer, now that whatever that twisted ceremony I&#39;d witnessed was coming to a close. I had to think fast. That archway blocked by metal bars I&#39;d seen had to lead somewhere, if only I could break through. Annoyingly, having an all-rounder character meant all of my stats were relatively the same. I&#39;d need some high level strength to do any damage to them. I doubt even Sam could have done it... I looked through my inventory, hoping for some sort of solution, and there it was. The Sword of Volcanic Infernos. Despite the name, it was a low-level weapon that could sometimes inflict burn damage. It was mostly useless in combat outside of the ice fields. But it was unfathomably hot. If it generated enough heat...<br />
<br />
I held the blade against the bars, and felt great relief as it sizzled and bubbled, until I cut clean through the metal. Somehow, my ridiculous plan worked! The bar fell to the ground with a massive clang that could have woken the dead. Thankfully, I only needed to cut one. I climbed through the small gap I&#39;d made, desperate for freedom. Then I heard it. A deep growl that made the hairs on my neck stand up, followed by a bone-shaking, deep voice. &quot;You always were resourceful...&quot;<br />
<br />
I spun around, and found myself face to face with a barrage of golden fur. A stalwart torso laden with muscle that couldn&#39;t be hidden by the dowry fur that coated it. My eyes trailed upwards, until I looked into the dark eyes, and devilish grin, of a ferocious werewolf. I gulped. &quot;Sam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the furry flesh,&quot; he smirked. He lunged towards me, and I jolted back in terror. He crashed into the metal bars with a horrid sound that would certainly alert the entire pack of wolves. He only laughed, a distorted chuckle that set me on edge. &quot;Of course you would find a way out without me,&quot; he growled, pacing left to right along the set of bars. &quot;It&#39;s a shame we didn&#39;t stick together. It would make Master&#39;s job so much easier if we both complied...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t my fault!&quot; I cried, jabbing an accusing finger in his direction. &quot;Why did you keep playing? You knew I wouldn&#39;t be gone long! We could have got out together! But you had to be all macho, and attempt it alone. If it wasn&#39;t for that ceremony, I probably-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so you witnessed my initiation,&quot; Sam grunted. He shrugged his heavy shoulders, claws tapping on the bars, as if sending out a message. &quot;I imagine it was quite the show for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- No!&quot; I stammered, trying not to blush. Even now, I could feel my cock pressing hard against my pants. Why did these werewolves have to be so sexy? I shook my head, and said, &quot;Watching that thing turn you into a beast... It was... It was so-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exhilarating!&quot; Sam bellowed. &quot;The power, the pleasure, it was more than anything I could imagine! I was like you, eager to leave. Foolish. But Master showed me the light, and welcomed me into his pack. He could help you too. Embrace the inevitable, and join us before you do something stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could hear distant howls further in the caverns. Others were coming. I took one last look at the massive, furry beast that my friend had become, and turned on my heels. &quot;No, I&#39;m bringing an end to this. I will save you, Sam!&quot; I cried before I ran toward the light. &quot;I&#39;ll save you...&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t turn back once. I kept running until my stamina bar was depleted entirely, and I collapsed to the ground, breathless. I rested against a tree, and looked back. I had cleared the caverns, and even managed to run deep into the forest. Thankfully, no stray werewolves were tracking me that I could see, and Sam hadn&#39;t broken through the bars himself. Maybe there was still a part of him that remembered us, that wanted to be human again. I whacked a palm against my head. This was only a game! None of this was really happening. Sam was just playing his part, like all RPG players do. So why did it feel so real...<br />
<br />
I pulled at my stats once more. 9 minutes until stage 2... My character model was looking more wolfish by the minute. My teeth were sharp, and fang-like. My body hair was growing like crazy. All the stress and fighting was taking a hit on me too. I could see a few gray hairs in my wild beard, and my face looked less juvenile, more mature in ways I couldn&#39;t quite place... But I couldn&#39;t keep watching myself change further. If I didn&#39;t hurry, it wouldn&#39;t be long until I looked as feral as Sam did. Before he was converted... I ate some stamina boosting berries before bursting forth again.<br />
<br />
As I ran into the nearby town, I noticed a few NPCs and players steer clear of me. A couple even brandished their weapons before they could recognize that I wasn&#39;t a threat to them. It wasn&#39;t until I paused in the town square to get my bearings straight that I realized I had been running on all fours. When I stood upright, I still had a significant hunch, and it felt almost unnatural being on two limbs. <br />
<br />
I identified the nearest apothecary, and burst inside. The old lady at the counter took one look at me, and shook her head. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; she tutted. &quot;Another foolish adventurer trying to take on the Werewolf King.&quot;<br />
<br />
King? He did seem overly powerful. But he was still a player like the rest of us, right? I scratched at the new hairs sprouting across the back of my neck, and growled, &quot;You can fix this, right? I heard there was a remedy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, the wolfsbane elixir. It can stop the lycanthropy effects in its tracks. As long as you take it before you reach the second stage. Then it gets trickier to fix.&quot;<br />
<br />
I open my stats nervously. I still had a few minutes left. I drummed my fingers impatiently against the counter as the old lady hobbled to her stockpile of pre-made potions, painfully aware of the clacking sound my nails made as they grew longer and denser. I bounced on my feet with unbridled anxiety and energy, trying to keep myself from hunching over too much. Finall,y she obtained the potion, and gave it to me. I wolfed it down immediately, wiping the residue from my furry face. I could only hope that it was in time...<br />
<br />
I checked my stats once more. The countdown had stopped with mere seconds to spare. I sighed in relief, and fell into a nearby chair. However, I couldn&#39;t help but notice something. Namely, that I was still covered with lots of hair, and had noticeably wolfish features. I waited a few moments, but my appearance still didn&#39;t change. &quot;Hey, what gives?&quot; I growled, my voice noticeably grittier, and deeper. &quot;I thought this was supposed to cure me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. The elixir stops the lycanthropy from overtaking your body and mind. Unlike those poor souls in the forest who succumb to the hivemind of the wolf pack. If you want to be cured of your malady, you must first vanquish the Werewolf King.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vanquish?&quot; I groaned. There was no way I&#39;d be able to do that alone. Sam was a much stronger warrior than I was, he almost came close to defeating him, but now he was trapped in the pack. I shouldn&#39;t have cowered in the sidelines, I should have helped... I stared at my hands, focussing on the thick hairs and black claws that had overtaken them. &quot;Isn&#39;t there anything else?&quot; I asked the woman. &quot;An appearance charm, or an illusion spell, or anything that could make me appear human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, this kind of dark magic cannot be disguised by mere illusions. If you had allowed yourself to become a full werewolf, then you would be able to freely shift between human and wolf. But you would also have lost your mind and freedom to the Werewolf King. And while the wolfsbane severs those ties, it also brings a halt to your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leaving me stuck in-between,&quot; I mumbled. &quot;Part human, part wolf...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But there is a solution,&quot; the woman declared with a sly smile. &quot;You can rid yourself of the curse by vanquishing the King. The power he has over all werewolves will be shattered, and anyone afflicted with his curse will be cured of all maladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vanquish... You mean, I have to kill him if I ever want to be human again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t want to become a full werewolf, then I&#39;m afraid so. But remember, young warrior. Sometimes, it isn&#39;t wise to rush into battles you cannot win. Your actions can have grave consequences. I&#39;m sure you have learned that lesson already. If you are inflicted with lycanthropy again, I fear there may be no further remedies. Be cautious. Be wise.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took another glance at my character. I still had human-like traits. I didn&#39;t have a muzzle like a wolf, or the long ears on top of my head. But I did have some gnarly teeth with ferocious looking fangs. I was covered with far more hair than a man ever should, but too thin to be considered fur. In fact, I was so distracted by how hairier I was, I hadn&#39;t noticed that I&#39;d lost my armor. I was only dressed in civilian clothes; A simple tunic, and a pair of tights. No wonder it was so visible... <br />
<br />
My beard had grown thick and shaggy, and mixed into my chest hair to the point that there was no discernible difference. The top of my hands were coated with fur, the tips of my fingers ended with sharp, black claws, and the palms of my hands felt tougher, like the beginnings of paw pads. My feet had suffered the same fate, and were already making the shift to canine anatomy. And to top it all off, I could just about spy a short, dark gray tail poking out from behind me. The fact I could actually feel it sway as if it were really attached to me, that shouldn&#39;t have been possible. And yet, it was there.<br />
<br />
I sighed and closed the screen. So I was part-wolf, but I wasn&#39;t a werewolf. And nothing short of killing the man that had forced my best friend, my boyfriend, into joining his pack would fix it. Not even illusion magic could have an effect, apparently. But that would have to all wait for tomorrow. I took off my headset, and shake my head clear of wolfy thoughts. It had turned nighttime, and I hadn&#39;t even noticed. I could smell dinner cooking downstairs. I stared at myself in the mirror to ground myself. No fangs, no claws, no tail. This game was messing with my mind... Maybe my mom was right, the game was becoming a bad influence on me. I should probably put it away and leave it for a few days. It doesn&#39;t need my constant attention, right?<br />
<br />
The bracelet tightened against my wrist, choking me with its sharp pain. Then it subsided. I looked at myself in the mirror once more, scratching at my beard with irritation. It had reached the point where it was obvious I was intentionally growing it, and it wasn&#39;t just a lapse in hygiene. Which meant it was itchy as hell! I may have to acquire some of my dad&#39;s beard oils... I had considered shaving, but now that it had thickened and coated my jaw, cheeks and neck with its dark growth, I was getting quite attached. And it complemented the hairs that were sprouting across my broad chest. They swirled around my pecs, and had even begun to curl over my shirt collar. I could swear I was never this hairy a week ago, yet I must have been. It&#39;s not like it could just grow overnight. But as much as I loved the look, I changed into a shirt with a higher collar, since I knew Mom wouldn&#39;t approve. I suppose she just can&#39;t accept that her little boy was becoming a man. At least I knew one person who liked the new me. I smiled at the thought of Sam, a sad smile. I hoped he was OK. His character went through a shit time earlier. Hopefully, he&#39;d be able to explain his actions when he also logged out.<br />
<br />
Dinner was a little eventful. Mom strongly suggested, once again, I should do something about my beard, while Dad argued that I was a growing lad, and could experiment with my appearance if I wanted. This was unusual, Dad usually kept out of these arguments. It was nice to see him being more assertive, and diplomatic. He also looked slimmer, his suit looked oddly baggy on him. I suppose his company&#39;s plan of using Reborn Venture for health & wellbeing was working for him. My Mom was surprised by the change in his demeanor, too, and conversation quickly shifted to the incompetency of our grocery store not having anything in stock. <br />
<br />
I thought about booting up the game once more before bed, but the whole situation had left me tired beyond belief. I checked my phone one last time, and Sam still hadn&#39;t read my texts. After what I&#39;d read on the forums, and what I witnessed in-game, I was worried about him. But all I could do was wait and see him at school. I went to bed early, visions of wolves fogging my brain until I fell asleep.</p>
