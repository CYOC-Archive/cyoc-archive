<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew felt quite good with the way things in his life had gone since becoming an Animalian. He&#39;d felt more secure and confident in himself and had found acceptance and even love. It was something that made him quite happy with Kinjara and even found Ruby to be quite the eager partner as well. Some of that just fit with being a Lion Animalian and adapting and adjusting to his own new instincts and the things that he&#39;d converted for. In an odd way, he also felt quite proud in that his son, had seemed to have similar success with Zoe and Lena. The happy relationships all raised the question on the things that were coming next, and the big thing being that of a wedding, and with Kinjara presently pregnant, Andrew wanted that for her when it was most practical. The real question was when and how to be practical with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;To a great degree, I do not mind,&quot; Kinjara said to him as he sat with her and Ruby around the Hill family dinner table. Jeff and his mates weren&#39;t there at the moment, but then with Jeff needing to finish school, a wedding wasn&#39;t quite the biggest thing for him at the moment. &quot;Just being with you... and having Ruby present as part of a pride... that is enough for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but I&#39;d want something official... to honor both you and Ruby,&quot; Andrew spoke, &quot;to show and tell the world that I love both of you and will treat you both as you deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So noble,&quot; Ruby gave a smile, &quot;and Nevada has opened things up to allow for multiple partners in marriage?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The state has allowed it... at least so far as I know,&quot; Andrew spoke, &quot;at least in the sense of tolerating the union, so long as all sides can provide evidence that everything is willing and not coerced. From the way I understand it... it&#39;s more like a legal recognition of an &quot;open marriage&quot; more than anything else. The churches don&#39;t follow it... as they have largely stuck to one man/one woman... but that doesn&#39;t mean that government officials can&#39;t do the weddings. In fact, Mayor Clara could even do it... might make things easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make what easier?&quot; came Jeff&#39;s voice, making them turn their shoulders to see Andrew&#39;s son come into the room.<br />
<br />
The other male Lion Animalian gave a slight nod to his father and the Meat Market&#39;s &quot;King Andrew&quot; before making his way to the refrigerator. Andrew was quiet for a moment or two while his son picked out a water bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly scheduling a wedding for myself with Kinjara and Ruby,&quot; Andrew answered.<br />
<br />
“I trust I’m invited,” Jeff commented with a small chuckle and there were further chuckles that came from the two females. It was something that had come about as Jeff and Andrew had gotten along well enough that despite some of Jeff&#39;s &quot;issues&quot; with his father working at the Meat Market, the two were in a position to be in coalition together, and would assure that when Jeff finished school, he and his mates would live nearby and his mates, along with Kinjara and Ruby could then get the hunting tags and hunt together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Andrew smiled, &quot;you are family... the big thing is going to be more the scheduling, and we think that Clara could help with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, &quot;that makes sense... though, you may want to get to it quickly during the week. Thanksgiving is coming up soon, and both of us will have potential in-laws coming to visit... and at the same time, because Mayor Clara&#39;s office is at the Great Hall... they&#39;re likely also getting ready for the big feast that they have there for Thanksgiving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded and accepted that...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next day was quiet as Andrew walked with Kinjara and Ruby into the Great Hall. As Jeff had predicted, the Monday before Thanksgiving had a lot of activity going on in the main hall area. While the holiday was still a few days away, the staff was still moving what bits of furniture that were part of the hall&#39;s normal decoration to then set up the long folding tables for the Thanksgiving feast, which Animalians seemed to prefer doing as a large communal event rather than has a family dinner. Not all Animalians did this, as many that had been Human stuck to tradition and those that were uplifted to join the families that once owned them in one way or another, as mates as Samson had with Abby or as siblings as Mary-Alice (Malice) had with Sarah, but there were still many that joined in both or didn&#39;t necessarily have those connections. Some former Humans even joined in because the Animalian feast for Thanksgiving meant less cleaning for them at home.<br />
<br />
Though, Andrew and his mates weren&#39;t there for the Thanksgiving feast at that time. Andrew had called and gotten an appointment with Mayor Clara to try and set up the schedule for the wedding between himself and his mates. They walked along the side of the room to give the staff the room to set up the tables for Thanksgiving and then going to the stairs that lead up to the second floor where Clara&#39;s office was, as where many of the other offices for Animalia&#39;s city government. They eventually were greeted by Clara&#39;s secretary and then buzzed into her office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... dear... you didn&#39;t have to come all this way like that,&quot; Clara said to Kinjara, noting the Lioness Animalian&#39;s round middle and remembered her own pregnancy in the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, you needn&#39;t worry,&quot; Kinjara replied, though also inwardly smiling with pride at her pregnancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just here to talk about scheduling a wedding between us and Andrew,&quot; Ruby commented, &quot;what would work best for you and for us... as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re busy with things going on right now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of what we&#39;re having now has been fairly routine and day to day business,&quot; Clara answered as she moved around her desk while Andrew offered Kinjara and a chair and then did the same for Ruby. &quot;The biggest thing is more the preparations for the plethora of holidays that come up this time of year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We weren&#39;t thinking about doing things around this time of year,&quot; Andrew spoke, &quot;we have family coming for Thanksgiving and plenty to prepare for there, and some are still adjusting to the fact that Jeff and I... well... have adjusted to a more &quot;lion-like&quot; lifestyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were actually leaning more toward spring or summer,&quot; Kinjara commented, &quot;by then, my litter will be born and Jeff and his mates could look after them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t he be looking to marry?&quot; Clara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;While he is double dosed, I would prefer he wait until after he&#39;s graduated college... like the original Animalia Ambassadoria cast has,&quot; Andrew spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t graduated, yet,&quot; Clara corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they will by the summer, correct?&quot; Ruby wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Clara answered, &quot;Josephine Brown is still on Animalia&#39;s City Council... and I do attend meetings at times. It allows for some conversations to be had on family and all that. It was also a way to keep track of things when Animalia started. Abby was going INTO her freshman year in high school when Animalia began in 2016. She then began her senior year in 2020. With this, she&#39;s in her junior year in college right now. So, she will go into her senior year next year. And her friends and their mates are in the same position... with the exception of Simon, who was a senior when the 2016 school year started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I...&quot; Ruby said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Clara gave a small smile, &quot;Animalia Ambassadoria has won a lot of fans and attention... and to a degree has brought in a fair amount of fan mail for the original cast, so it isn&#39;t a surprise that people would have some interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they wanting to get married... we wouldn&#39;t to overlap with them,&quot; Andrew said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That... I don&#39;t know,&quot; Clara spoke, &quot;while they are in college... they are also legal adults and can choose to get married before they graduate. Though, I haven&#39;t heard anything that would indicate that they have any plans yet... So, for the moment, if you&#39;re looking to schedule something for the summer... things are fairly free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about on Animalia&#39;s birthday?&quot; Kinjara wondered, &quot;or is that something special for you and Deputy Mayor Robbie to take your families out somewhere...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we often do go out to eat together, and share on how far we&#39;ve come,&quot; Clara answered, &quot;but that&#39;s all in the evening hours. If your wedding plan is for the day... that&#39;s perfectly fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew couldn&#39;t help but smile at that.</p>
