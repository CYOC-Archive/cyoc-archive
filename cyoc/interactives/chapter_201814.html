<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha had &#39;officially&#39; changed Tom&#39;s name to the feminine &#39;Tomi&#39;...dogs had to be registered in their county.  He was registered &#39;female&#39;.  She had actually, for a joke, but on the official form listed &#39;Owner(s)&#39; as Samantha and Max, both with her last name.<br />
It was hard to tell how much of Tom remained.  The setting had been at 1 so mentally Tomi should still be about 90% human mentally.  She told herself that making him female and the compliant non-aggressive nature of the greyhound breed probably has affected her mental capacities.<br />
At any rate, she considered him a pet now.  The idea of transforming her back into a human husband simply didn&#39;t work any more.  It wasn&#39;t any animosity or grudge that brought this mindset about in Samantha, it was simply living with the wonderful greyhound pet her husband had become.<br />
<br />
Max on the other hand she had long wondered about changing.  The program had never included him as a member of the family so it wasn&#39;t an option.  However, she had never really looked into it but had recently had an ad pop up for enhancements to the program.<br />
Failing that she had begun to toy with the idea of transforming herself.  She&#39;d already been with Max...and as time receded the indignity of that episode&#39;s handling she had come to appreciate some of the aspects of being taken by the big Shepherd.  Something going wrong and the pregnancy issue had made her hesitant, though she did relish the possibility of Max choosing her for sex over his current mate.<br />
Converting him to a human seemed a much better solution...she had been loyal to her marriage, sort of feeling Tom was still not &#39;death do us part&#39;.  But Max had already taken her out of the strictly faithful column.  There was no doubt she&#39;d been intimate with him, but it was her husband&#39;s doing and it couldn&#39;t be undone.  So in her mind it was a grey area to offer herself to Max again, willingly this time.<br />
<br />
What had occurred to her just today was a third possibility.  If she were the male, and canine it would eliminate the pregnancy worry.  The question at first was how could she make Max female any more than human?  He wasn&#39;t on the family members list.  Tomi was.<br />
She could go to being a male Shepherd and have Tomi herself.  As she thought about it the idea became more appealing, other than that Tomi was sort of property of Max and she&#39;d feel kind of guilty about that...though when she really thought about it that was more an amusing reality than guilt inducing.  But the fact that she identified her &#39;dog self&#39; as Shepherd, like Max, spoke volumes in her opinion...she was no less Max&#39;s than his other human bitch.<br />
<br />
And that thought sent a hot wave of pleasure from her mind to her sex.  When she undressed at night, when she showered or got down on hands and knees to retrieve something from under the sofa Max was there...or if he wasn&#39;t he was on her mind.  She&#39;d thought of giving herself to him as they both were, human and animal; or having him service her orally but it just didn&#39;t feel right.<br />
<br />
She decided right then to look on-line and see if they had updated the software in a way to be able to satisfy her needs.<br />
It turned out that the software enhancement to allow pets as &#39;Family Members&#39; had come out only about a month after she&#39;d made the changes to her husband.  Having delayed months to check, she couldn&#39;t get the download fast enough.  No wait necessary, she could just download the update once she charged the cost to Tom&#39;s old credit card.  The card ran out in a month.  Samantha smiled, thrilled the last charge his card would ever process was a gift for her and his former pet.  Max had wandered in with Tomi a few minutes ago.  She called Max over, giving him a kiss on the nose...letting him lick her face back for the first time ever.<br />
Tomi looked anxiously from her spot behind where Max had been lying.<br />
&quot;Awww...is my girl feeling left out?&quot;  Samantha clicked her tongue, calling Tomi to come to her for some attention.<br />
Tom...Tomi now though she still thought of herself at times in terms of her former privileged white male status came to the woman of color at her call.  The female portion of her mind looked enviously at the confidence, intelligence and beauty of the dark skinned woman that was once her wife; her status as human insurmountably high above the greyhound dog owned by her.  Tomi also had enough intelligence in her brain to figure out what her Owner was doing.  Mixed emotions...longing, jealousy, humiliation and lust all mixed together...caused her sex to moisten<br />
&quot;Can you read still girl?&quot; Samantha looked down at the solid white greyhound.  She always loved the way it&#39;s pink hued skin sort of came through the white fur.  The bitch nodded, having already read the screen.<br />
&quot;Good girl...I&#39;m so proud of you!&quot;  Tomi lowered her head at the praise and began licking at her Master&#39;s dark feet and toes.<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve figured out what is going to happen to Max, huh?&quot;<br />
Tomi began to whine.<br />
&quot;No point waiting, is there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha ordered Tomi to the corner of the room and had her &#39;sit&#39; then &#39;stay&#39; while Max was brought to jump up into the chair so he could be scanned and transformed.  Among the settings Samantha gave him about 20% dog brain and instincts, hoping he would retain the right animal impulses, jet black skin with blue eyes.  And large.  Max was already big for a Shepherd.  Why skimp on his size as a human?  &#39;Perception Of Reality&#39;?  Hmmm...that was what controlled awareness of what you had been prior to the change.<br />
Samantha looked at Tomi, shaking her head at her former husband&#39;s thickheaded lack of attention to detail.  She set that so Max would retain full knowledge...one of the things she fantasized about when she remembered his taking her was that knowing she had been human made her more desirable than any other bitch.  Now she wanted him to know that she was fully human while his status would require effort to garner her attention.<br />
<br />
She clicked on the button to begin the enhancements.  Tomi began to whine pathetically in the corner.  Samantha went and comforted her with petting and praise while her mate began the process of replacing her as the man in Samantha&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
When the program stopped she reached over and turned the swivel chair to have her creation face her.  She could see the awe in her Max&#39;s bright blue eyes.<br />
&#39;talk about first impressions&#39; she thought to herself as she checked out the package between his legs.  He slipped from the chair, crawling to her eager from her scent.</p>
