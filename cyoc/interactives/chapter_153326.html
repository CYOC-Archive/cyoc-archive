<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A potion&quot; Tom said in fear, Sam looked towards the flask in Tom&#39;s hand. The glass looked old and translucent, the cork keeping the liquid form just falling out was weary and battered, either due to age or something else. As for the liquid inside the flask, it was mirky red, with what Sam assumed was bubbles popping against the surface. There was still some activity left in the potion, which means it could work. However Sam had his doubts because of the lack of information on the flask, the label was mostly unreadable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me look at that&quot; Sam said quickly gesturing towards Tom. <br />
<br />
Tom quickly passed over the potion. With the potion now in his hands, Sam gave a closer look to the label on the flask. All that he could clearly see was the remants of a diagram and two works (in bestia) it looked like some form of latin. As for the diagram, it showed the image of a muscular right arm, with a long claw at the end of each finger tip, the picture was black and white so that was the only details he could take out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I think it&#39;s some sort of strength potion&quot; Sam stuttered, still suspicious of the potion.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got no time Sam, drink it or don&#39;t&quot; Tom cried, watching as the barricade slowly diminished, with large cracks now forming in it. That barricade was going to break any minute, so there was really no choice as to what Sam could do.<br />
<br />
He unplugged the flask, and taking a deep breath downed the contents of the flask in one. <br />
<br />
Sam had an immediate reaction to the liquid. It burned in his mouth, like a hot tea. But before he could spit it out, the solution had already escaped down his throat. He felt as the burning sensation was carried from his mouth down his throat to the rest of his body. Tom turned around and looked at Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam...are you okay??&quot; <br />
<br />
His mouth had gone numb by now, instead he was clutching his chest which was now in severe pain. <br />
<br />
&quot;S-sam?? Your Eyes...they&#39;ve changed colour&quot;.<br />
<br />
From Tom&#39;s point of view he could see that Sam&#39;s eyes had changed from a dark green to a searing crimson. They softly glowed. He could also see that Sam&#39;s blood vessels were pushing against his head and neck, thumping outwards in union with his heart beat, which was now going erratic. <br />
<br />
Sam was terrified by the fact that he might of just drank a potion which was poisonous. That he would die in this spiralling pain and leave Tom alone to fend against the Minotaur. However this theory was closed when Sam felt a strange sensation in his chest. Not only was the pain diminishing now, but his chest was expanding forwards...slowly but it was definately noticeable.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what.. the hell&quot; Sam said, looking down at his chest. He then felt something like his heart leaping forwards. He clutched harder onto his chest, feeling now the growing muscles and mass. This strength potion wasn&#39;t only a buff but also a physical change. Sam could now feel his arms growing as well, the biceps inflating pushing against the lining of his clothes. Tom could only watch in horror as Sam changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I c-can&#39;t breath&quot; Sam struggled, his muscles had now inflated to the point where his clothes were stopping his circulation. He used his ever growing hand to rip off his t-shirt. He could now see, in all its glory, his muscular chest. To Tom, he was terrified, whatever this potion was doing to Sam it was changing him into a monster. However to Sam he felt a relief, like this was always something he craved for, but just didn&#39;t understand. <br />
<br />
The rest of Sam&#39;s body was following suite with his changes. His biceps grow even larger to the size of a small football, his leg muscles had grown beyond the size of any other&#39;s and his continued pecs were nearly twice the size of his head. Sam was enjoying the changes now, the pain was still there but he was relishing it.<br />
<br />
He now stood there 3 times larger than Tom, filled to the brim with muscle and ectasy. He flexed his new physique feeling his tight strong muscles stretch. <br />
<br />
&quot;S-sam are you okay&quot; Tom said nervously, looking at the completely transformed figure in front of him.<br />
<br />
Sam in a deep voice said &quot;I feel more than okay...I feel amazing&quot; he said, stretching his new body out. But before Sam could talk anymore he felt a severe pain in his head. &quot;Ahh....wh-whats going on&quot; Sam said fearfully.<br />
<br />
To Tom&#39;s horror, Sams figure started to contort even more. His skin went a deep red, with black hair deepening the tone until he was completely covered in it. His held his arm as it spassed out, it grow again a size before claws sprouted out of the end. They looked like tiny daggers. The same thing happened with his other hand. His legs also spassed out before his toes merged into his feet and his bone cracked. His feet became hooves. Tom soon realised what Sam was being turned into, it was the same creature they were being chased by...a minotaur.<br />
<br />
Sam put his hands against his head groaning as two long horns grew out of his forehead. His face also changed, becoming similar to the minotaur outside the room.<br />
<br />
He knelt against the wall, trying to relieve the pressure of the transformation. But to no avail, the changes came swift and soon enough he was a fully formed minotaur. <br />
<br />
Sam groaned lowly...he was even more compacted with muscle than before. <br />
<br />
&quot;S-sam?&quot; Tom stuttered.<br />
<br />
The minotaur looked at Tom, breathing slowly it said &quot;Its t-turned me into that creature&quot;.<br />
<br />
Before Tom and Sam could say another word the barricade gave way, out of the door came the other minotaur, roaring loudly. It stirred around visciously towards Tom and Sam.</p>
