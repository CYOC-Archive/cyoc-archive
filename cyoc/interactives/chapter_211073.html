<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I didn&#39;t say I&#39;ll leave you like that yes? Now come bow for the Audience assistant.&quot; Mephistopheles calmly chided you from his spot, still in a deep bow toward the cheering crowds.<br />
<br />
You paused at that, and quickly realizing that your panicked outburst was unfounded your furry cheeks heated up some more. Quickly you joined Mephistopheles in bowing to the crowd, who seemed to cheer and clap even harder as well as whistle much to your initial confusion before realization hit.<br />
<br />
But before you stopped bowing, a soft snap signaled a sudden puff of smoke which almost seemed to abruptly drown out the noise of the crowds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bravo! Another show splendidly done! And all thanks to you my dear gorgeous, beautiful, endowed, shapely and voluptious assistant!&quot; He suddenly cried out with a series of soft claps as the smoke cleared enough for you to see the both of you were behind the stage. The sounds of the cheering crowds dissipated then turned into a morass of noises, both much-too-distant talking and the sounds of the masses leaving the tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now to empty the scales.&quot;<br />
<br />
With another snap you found yourself enveloped by smoke again, like the first time this happened you were hit by an intense yet momentary feeling of vertigo that made you blink, and suddenly you felt different. Gone was your fur, and with them the paws, ears and tail of the bunny you had been, and yet, other than the return of your skin, and normal human senses, nothing had changed! In fact, you were straight back to looking like Mephistopheles voluptuous female assistant with your lithe body, huge hourglass curves and melon-sized tits with nipples that were barely covered by the flaps of your tight latex bunnysuit leotard which was so thin you could see your thick nipples poke through them and your cunt was shown off in an impractical cameltoe, daint hands with red-painted fingernails and daint feet fitted into black 4-inch heels. Not to mention the waist-length gold-blond hair, thick and luscious lips, slim and gorgeous face, and the white cuffs around your wrists, the cute red bow-tie around your collar, and finally, the cute little tophat on your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- hey! You were supposed to turn me back!&quot; You shout indignantly, pouting at the latex magician who seem to blink confusedly at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I did indeed change you back, my beautiful assistant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why am I still a GIRL with giant TITS?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what you have always then though. A slutty young woman with a willingness to be my assistant.&quot; Mephistoles raised a brow at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what are you talking about? It was YOU who made me like THIS!&quot; You still shouted, not being dragged in front of a massive audience and being toyed with via magical nonsense by a suddenly attentive Magician.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? You were a frequent volunteer in my shows before I approached you about becoming my assistant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?! You turned me into your big-titted assistant litterally at the start of this show!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My hat does not do mind tricks assistant, it was you who accepted to be my assistant.&quot; He shook his head chidingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-but- Argh! Just- turn me back already!&quot; You didn&#39;t have the patience to deal with this nonsense, you wanted to go home and go to bed already.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already have, this is how you were when we first met?&quot; Mephistopheles sounded somewhat confused at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn me back to a man!&quot; You practically spelt out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were never a man though.&quot; He now frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- You- Then turn me INTO a man then!&quot; You seethed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I do that?&quot; He seemed to respond as if she&#39;d asked the most ridiculous thing. &quot;A male just doesn&#39;t work as a showtrick but women catch the eyes immediately! And you&#39;ve always been a woman completely comfortable with her slutty form. And you should know my hat doesn&#39;t even &#120357;&#120368; men, not to mention that a &#120366;&#120354;&#120365;&#120358; assistant just doesn&#39;t work here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- you... W-what do you mean your hat doesn&#39;t &#120357;&#120368; men?&quot; You were stricken with confusion at this mans apparent conviction that you were always his voluptuous female assistant whom had willingly come to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same with everyone else in the Circus, this hat of mine will only change women, which is why my audience aren&#39;t all latex anthro rabbits and why I only take female volunteers in my shows.&quot; Mephistopheles answered as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.<br />
<br />
And you were struck speechless by his stubborn logic, if felt like he was being completely truthful, or for some reason believed his own words so completely when they were so clearly false? &#39;Does he think me a stupid airheaded bimbo?&#39; You thought as you stared incomprehensibly at Mephistopheles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think me stupid?&quot; You impulsively decided to ask him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? no!&quot; He seemed taken aback at the seeming absurdity of the question. &quot;Why would I ever think or want my Assistant foolish? If they cannot act intelligently they cannot properly help me with my shows and tricks! So I would never want my Assistants able to be fooled!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;when did I come to you?&quot; You asked with narrowed eyes, to which Mephistopheles stared back you incomprehensibly.<br />
<br />
&quot;5 years ago? You were my third volunteer for the show and made you into a rabbit whom I placed into my hat, then pulled you out as an anthro rabbit, and then we both bowed for the crowd and they cheered for you? I then met you again outside my tent giving out autographs and you came to me asking whether you could be my permanent assistant?&quot;<br />
<br />
You were struck by an odd sense of Deja vu at those words, and you realized that other than the &#39;third volunteer&#39; and outside part it was exactly what they did now. You glanced down at your barely held bust which covered the bottom of your sight and your wide childbearing hips with drumstick thighs and equally as massive butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I look like when i first volunteered before you did any of your magic on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well...&quot; Mephistopheles seemed to need to really think about that one. &quot;A voluptuous young bimbo with a bright, excited smile on her slutty makeup-covered face-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slutty makeup?&quot; You interrupt out of curiosity and/or annoyance at being offhandedly called a bimbo or implied to be a slut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes? Just like you have had for todays show?&quot; He answered confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can i have a mirror please?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
Mephistopheles shrugged and waved his wand, causing a fullbody mirror to appear showing exactly what you already knew had changed with your body, and let you see your makeup and fat red-coloured lips, as well as how they were framed by your luxurious gold-blond hair. &#39;Oh my gosh I really &#120357;&#120368; look like a stupid fucking bimbo!&#39; You realized and raged inside the sanctuary of your mind, for that was exactly how the figure in the mirror looked. And while you were busy staring at your mirage, Mephistopheles continoued his recollection.<br />
<br />
&quot;A voluptuous young bimbo with a bright, excited smile on her slutty makeup-covered face with bright red fingernails and lips, wearing a black skintight latex bunnygirl leotard that barely held her overflowing bosom and clearly flaunted her hourglass curves to any who could see. She walked around in 4-inch heels yet seemed to constantly bounce in excitement and energy, unsatiated by the other performers here at this most honourable circus, and I swore then and there that she would forever be my Bunny, hopping around without a single care given to what others thought of her.&quot; He reminisced as he walked closer to you, looked at your bimbo mirage with a nostalgic look in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that right Bunny?&quot; He suddenly asked from behind you when suddenly his hands grabbed ahold of each of your hefty globes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh- Ahnnh!&quot; You moaned at the pleasure radiating from your, reflexively attempting to remove his grasp of your erogenous sphere yet being betrayed by your own body refusing to touch his strong hands. &quot;Ahnn-s-sto-ah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were always so easy, excitingly doing every task. Exceeding well beyond my expectations at assisting me in my shows. And when you thought you didn&#39;t do well enough? You were so easy to calm, and excite, with the simplest of touches.&quot; He continued, heedless of her embarassed wriggling attempts to escape his tit-fondling grasp as he hugged her from behind, nuzzling your neck much to your internal dismay and inability to resist. &quot;So very eager, and loving of my every touch. The perfect assistant that doesn&#39;t shy away from servicing my dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I digress, my show has never been about the more lewd topics the Ringleader mostly does.&quot; He pulled away, and much to your dismay felt more than a little want to have him continue, like a pet leaning into its owners palm for more pets.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what was t-that about?&quot; You tried to draw up on your anger at being so casually violated, but felt oddly calm yet hot and moist in your nethers down below...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, excuse me, I dont usually touch you until we&#39;re in our tent and you&#39;ve changed to your nightwear.&quot; Mephistopheles admitted slightly sheepishly before he shook his head. &quot;Hm, now where were I, ah, yes! Your request for assistanceship!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-huh?&quot; You meekly responded in confusion as he went back to retelling their supposed &#39;past&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;The day was old at that moment on that fateful day! And I had just finished autographing my previous volunteers tits when you approached with a blush on your slutty face and a hopeful hop in your step! &#39;Hello again Bunny! Are you here for another autograph? On your tits again, hmmm?&#39; I greeted you as the other volunteers went away, you were the last person to approach me then, and yet it wasn&#39;t for an autograph. &#39;Mephistopheles sir!&#39; You suddenly cried out. &#39;I-I&#39;ve come this time, not for autograph, or for a picture with your handsome, strong, gentlemanly and attractive body! Instead, hear me my Master! For I have come to seek to stay at your side as your assistant and lover until the day we pass into the great beyond!&#39; You called with such fervor and desire, and who was I to deny it? I accepted you! and we have stayed as lovers for all this time!&quot; He called out fervently in a way that you swore resonated with you, despite never having even heard, nor ever said anything like what he was saying you did.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I... I... did?&quot; You responded in a near-whisper, disbelief and belief clashing for position in your voice. It was unbelievable, utterly unbelievable, as nought but 20 minutes ago you had been a man who had suddenly found himself in a place surrounded by things of latex, seeking assistance in finding his way home. And here you are, listening to the nonsensical yet frustratingly oddly familiar recollections of a deluded magician who so bluntly and casually calls you bimbo and slut, as well as abruptly &#120360;&#120371;&#120368;&#120369;&#120358;&#120357; you, and you couldn&#39;t get yourself to resist!<br />
<br />
&quot;And so, on this still-young day where we yet have another show to do for our precious audience. I ask to you, my assistant, my slut, my Bunny, my Lover. Are you still willing to perform one last show as my beloved Lover, even should it be our last?&quot; Mephistopheles declared, turning to face you and offering his hand, though you are most stricken by the look he has in his eyes, an indecipherable look of expectation, sadness, confusion and hope.<br />
<br />
Something about this all rubbed you the wrong way, yet you could not help but feel compelled, a need forcing its way to the surface, a want to not disappoint your audience. The sheer internal mess in your mental landscape makes you question everything. Who are you even? Mephistopheles calls you Bunny, yet thats not a name...<br />
<br />
 Wait. What even was &#120378;&#120368;&#120374;&#120371; name?!<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot;</p>
