<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author Note: for some reason > these things break CYOC. I meant to use them to indicate internal thoughts but I guess that won’t work. Hopefully [] these will work instead.)<br />
<br />
Jen’s eyes snapped open, the conversation still fresh in her mind. What a weird dream. She yawned, or tried to, but the sound sort of caught in her throat. Her left arm felt numb, too, she couldn’t feel it at all. Something definitely was off. She started to reach over with her arm, but suddenly her head moved all on its own. Her vision shifted rapidly, and suddenly, she was staring down the length of her arm towards her own sleeping body. There, at the end of her other arm, was the sleeping head of her sister. Oh fuck. It wasn’t a dream. She gasped, feeling air rushing through her upper pussy lips and into her singular lung. She tried to call out to her sister but nothing happened. Panicked, she went to slap her, forgetting her repositioned head. She smacked painfully into her, waking her immediately. She heard her sister’s voice inside her head [What the hell, Jen? That fucking hurt!]<br />
<br />
[oww, why did I do that, I’m going to kill that nerd Kyle for this]<br />
<br />
[who the hell is Kyle? What does he have to do with anything?]<br />
<br />
[The idiot that cursed us to have this body! Also he made it so you don’t remember any of it. I swear I’m not lying.]<br />
<br />
Her sister stared at her with the most incredulous look. ]ha ha, very funny, Jen]<br />
<br />
[Oh god she doesn’t believe me, I can’t believe she doesn’t even think this is weird. This is insane!]<br />
<br />
[Ok Jen, this isn’t funny, stop.]<br />
<br />
[Oh right, you can hear me thinking. That’s really freaky. Is there any way I can keep anything private?]<br />
<br />
[Damn, is she serious?]<br />
<br />
Jess paused for a second.<br />
<br />
[Ok, swear to me, on your life. Do you really, genuinely think you had your own body separate from me when we went to bed last night? And you’re trying to honestly say to me that all of my memories of our time together, the first time we played with ourselves, our first date with Karyn, all of it, is just… fake? That’s bullshit and you know it, come on.]<br />
<br />
[Ok hold on, we’re gay? And have a girlfriend? The fuck?]<br />
<br />
[Holy shit you’re serious. You’re like, some kind of imposter, some alternate version of my sister from another universe. But how?]<br />
<br />
[None of that stuff is real, Jess, Kyle altered reality and everyone’s memories.]<br />
<br />
[Well, who’s to say he didn’t just send you to another universe or something? Also, cursed? Like, that urban legend? There’s no way that thing actually exists. Let’s just say you’ve developed temporary insanity, as that seems like the most likely explanation here. <br />
<br />
Jen frowned, [So you really think we were just born with heads for hands and a pussy for a head? How is that even possible?]<br />
<br />
[well, I, uhh….. you see… it’s a super rare condition and… well… holy shit. No. It’s all so real, I don’t care if it doesn’t make sense it’s my life dammit, please Jen, tell me it’s real, oh god, why?]<br />
<br />
Jess was clearly having a nervous breakdown at this point. Jen brought her head close to her sister’s, consoling her. [I’m sorry, I’ll just shut up.  Maybe this is an alternate universe! I mean, there’s supposed to be infinite of them, right? (It’s definitely not but like, idk maybe? Oh right she can hear me, shit.)]<br />
<br />
[It’s ok Jen, I believe you. It’s just… jeezus. How is this even possible? You’re right, this body just doesn’t make sense. It’s all I’ve ever known though. The idea that my whole existence is because of some guy’s perverted fantasy? God that’s creepy.]<br />
<br />
[You still exist, just… normal. Not like this.]<br />
<br />
[We should… probably get ready.]<br />
<br />
[Yeah]<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
 <br />
Chapter 3: Jess teaches Jen her new routine<br />
<br />
[Ok, how does any of this even work? How do we get dressed, or like… y’know… (do we like, eat ourselves out? We do don’t we. Oh right, hearing thoughts, oops.)]<br />
<br />
[It’s ok, sis. Plus yeah, it’s awesome, trust me.]<br />
<br />
[But isn’t that like… incest?]<br />
<br />
[I mean, kinda? What else are we supposed to do tho?]<br />
<br />
[Good point]<br />
<br />
Jess stuck her head under her arm. [God, eww, we need a shower.]<br />
<br />
Jen felt her body moving on its own. [Ahh, that feels fucking weird, stop!]<br />
<br />
[What?]<br />
<br />
[Moving. Like, without actually being the one in control. It feels really, really wrong.]<br />
<br />
[I just never even thought of that, I’m so used to sharing everything. I can’t imagine having my own body without you there. Sounds kinda lonely. You can take over though.]<br />
<br />
Walking to the bathroom, Jen momentarily gawked a their new body. With the range of motion her arm had, she had already gotten a good look at it, but seeing her face attached to it made it really sink in. Stepping into the shower, she encountered her first hurdle. She carefully grabbed the knob with her teeth and twisted, yelping as she felt the cold water on her head. Jessica twisted the other knob, and the water quickly turned to a comfortable temperature. She grabbed the shampoo bottle with her mouth, before realizing her mistake, putting it back down and fiddling with the cap to open it. She grabbed it and poured some over his sister’s hair. She paused, before realizing what she had to do next. [You gotta use your face] She closed her eyes and mouth tightly, rubbing her face all over her sister’s scalp to lather and spread the soap round in her hair. She sighed internally. [This is a pain, I can’t believe we do this every day]<br />
<br />
Jess rinsed her hair under the water, before repeating the process with Jen. Jen grabbed the soap bar with her teeth, avoiding touching it with her tongue as best she could. [This is ridiculous] she groaned, as she rubbed under her arms with the soap. She reached up, taken aback a bit by the strange sight of the pussy where her head should have been. She made sure to soap both of them well, before wiping herself off with a wet washcloth. <br />
<br />
[So… is it ok if we… uhh…]<br />
<br />
[Jen, I can hear your thoughts. You don’t need to ask, let’s just make it quick.]<br />
<br />
Reaching her head down between her legs, Jen went to work. She knew what spots to touch, but armed with teeth and tongue instead of fingers made things quite different. Jen had no experience with oral, and seeing her own pussy right up close like this felt surreal. She cautiously teased herself, tasting her own juices for the first time. She nibbled a bit on her clit, moaning silently, feeling her sister go to work on her upper pussy at the same time. She came, then twice, then three times, before noticing she’d been holding her breath the whole time. It was strange, but she just didn’t feel like she’d been holding her breath that long, and easily could’ve gone on longer. [ok, we should probably get out, we’ll be late.]<br />
<br />
[Holy shit, that was amazing. I might just stay this way just for that. I mean *holy fuck*. I could just do that forever.]<br />
<br />
[Yeah, not having hands is inconvenient but there are definitely some upsides. It’s still awesome even when you’re used to it.]<br />
<br />
Opening their shared wardrobe, Jen marveled at how different it looked. Everything there was custom made to fit their body, with every bra and top using Velcro instead of the usual straps so it’d be easier to put on with their condition. None of the tops had sleeves, with each one also fastening with Velcro. There were winter coats and rain jackets in there with the whole sleeve being split, attached with yet more Velcro.  The amount her parents must have spent just for their daughters’ convenience was… pretty typical for them. She just wished they would spend a bit more time actually paying attention to them in ways besides financial. Martha was nice, but not a substitute for actual parental affection. <br />
<br />
This time around, their socks were all in order, and she worked together with her sister to pull each one on with her teeth. Finally ready, it was time to head downstairs for… oh yeah, right. Breakfast. This should be interesting.</p>
