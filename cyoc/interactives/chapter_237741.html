<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And it was a...kid? Indeed, the one who walked through those doors had most likely just reached the double digits at the very most. A short haired blonde with a typical summery jersey and shorts, looking like he just got off the field from running around a lot. But that seemed odd to her. Lilianne couldn&#39;t help but think in bewilderment. Why would a child need a spa day?<br />
<br />
The kid seemed kind of awkward with Clyde. &quot;Uhh, I was just wanting to see what was in here. It said it was a sauna, so I thought maybe...I could relax here?&quot; Clyde responded with &quot;You certainly can! Right this way, sir.&quot; Tommy felt off by that response. There was something...robotic about it. As clean as the rather extravagant building he walked into.<br />
<br />
Deciding she needed to say something, Lilianne stepped into the room, her usual guest etiquette on display using a calmer voice to help make things more comfortable. &quot;A-Apologies if he&#39;s scaring you, I&#39;m Lilianna. I kind of run the place.&quot; She joked. Suddenly, Tommy felt a lot more at ease. In fact, he couldn&#39;t help but stare at her. &#39;Man...she&#39;s hot...&#39; He thought to himself. Feeling his face get hot from awkwardness, he shook his head. &quot;U-Uhh, yeah, nice to meet you, ma&#39;am! I&#39;m uhh...Tommy. Tommy Rockman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rockman? That sounded familiar to her. Wanting to know if she was correct, she continued her questions. &quot;Nice to meet you, Tommy. Tell me, where are your parents? I know this place isn&#39;t far from the local grade school, but most kids wouldn&#39;t be coming in here. At least not without supervision.&quot; Tommy thought for a moment. &quot;Well uhh...my parents are kind of busy a lot. They run a business, so I don&#39;t see them often. But Dad sometimes helps me with my football practice! I&#39;m gonna be a big man who gets all the ladies just like him someday!&quot; <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it hit her. Rockman! Like the ones who own that cruise liner! Lilianna recalled going on vacation on one of those once many years ago, and meeting a couple who had wanted to reclaim their youth due to meeting at such an old age.<br />
<br />
The Rockmans were definitely rich. In fact, they were loaded! Seems they had a child at some point, but are so caught up in their own lives they must not be around much to even pay attention to him. That sounded...kind of sad. Lilianna felt bad. Perhaps a normal, unmagical sauna experience might be what the kid’s looking for.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...I&#39;m sure you will be.&quot; Lilianna smiled. &quot;You looking for some relaxation, then? I can book you for a while, but it&#39;ll cost you.&quot; Tommy blurted out &quot;Yeah!&quot; But then realized he probably shouldn&#39;t have said that. &quot;I-I mean...yeah. It&#39;s kinda tough being by myself mostly. I&#39;ve been training to be on the junior varsity team when I&#39;m older too, so I&#39;m kinda feeling sore. The other kids in the neighborhood look up to me like a big bro since I&#39;m really good at the game and know how to take care of myself. It&#39;s a lot sometimes, but I kinda like it.&quot; He explained.<br />
<br />
Hearing his story, Lilianna felt a pang in her heart. Poor kid&#39;s got a lot of responsibilities put on him. At first, she didn&#39;t know if the kid even HAD money, but another part of her stopped caring. She was a witch, that was for certain, but she wasn&#39;t heartless. &quot;You know what? How but I give you this one on the house? Besides, you could use some time to treat yourself.&quot; She offered. Tommy’s eyes lit up. &quot;Really? I get to spend time with y--err--with no cash needed?&quot; He stumbled through his words. He just couldn&#39;t get over how pretty Lilianna was. It made his heart flutter. &quot;Yep! Free of charge! I&#39;ll even throw in a souvenir. Like uhh...a towel or something.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome! But uhh, before we get started, I wanted to ask you something.&quot; Tommy said. Lilianna looked intrigued. &quot;What’s on your mind?&quot; Then what he proceeded to ask her shocked her. Tommy looked around to see if anyone else was here before talking quieter. &quot;I...I overheard my parents one day talking about some magic spa that makes you hot or something. Is it true that this is the place?&quot; <br />
<br />
Lilianna was taken aback, but she couldn&#39;t say she was surprised he found out about her. Was that why he just so happened to stop by? &quot;...Yeah, you&#39;re right. The truth is, your parents stopped by hear a long time ago. Definitely took some years off their complexion, that&#39;s for sure.&quot; She joked. Though, it seemed Tommy was smart enough to pick up on the meaning behind that. &quot;Can this sauna make me hot too? I wanna be a cool guy that can do whatever he wants!&quot; Tommy didn&#39;t wanna sound crazy, but if this place was magical, that would mean maybe it could help him...skip some time? He didn&#39;t want to wait for his time to shine on a bigger sports team than a youth league. Maybe with this, he could be a shoe in for JV right now! But for the sake of not sounding like some kid, he refrained from letting Lilianna know his true intentions.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Lilianna was hesitant. She could make it a normal spa for today, but she had a feeling Tommy was on to her. She didn&#39;t know for certain, though, so cautiously, she said &quot;Absolutely. Just a few minutes in here, and you&#39;ll look even cuter than you already do. The girls are gonna love it. Heck, maybe even the guys too, if you swing that way.&quot; Tommy did admit, he did find himself being enamored with a guy or two in his grade as well. But he shook it off. Maybe if he were prettier, pretty much everyone would like him! &quot;Cool! Let&#39;s do this!&quot; He said excitedly.<br />
<br />
Lilianna began to think for a moment, though...should she let him in there with the magic version of the water? Or should she just give him a normal experience and maybe just make something to rejuvenate his soreness? And of course, if he did get older, she&#39;d have to cast a spell to make it so he fits in as his new age, maybe even give his mind the proper boost in knowledge and maturity. And that might be a little extra work she definitely isn&#39;t getting paid for. What to do...</p>
