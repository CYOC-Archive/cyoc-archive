<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen yawned. Sun shown brightly through her blinds. Birds chirped, and wind rustled the tree outside her window. Her alarm blared.<br />
<br />
With a tired, blind slam of her hand, she turned the alarm off. The 18-year-old centauress groggily threw her large blanket off and stumbled to her feet-no, hooves. She rubbed her eyes and stepped over lazily strewn shirts, papers, and various stuffed toys on the way to her bathroom to start getting ready for the day ahead.<br />
<br />
She bent down and splashed her face a few times to wake herself up while she waited for the shower to warm. It was a large shower, specially designed with her unique form in mind. It featured multiple jets, a showerhead on an extendable hose, and several different poles she could mount sponges to. All in all it fit her needs perfectly.<br />
<br />
Once it was nice and steamy, she stepped in, savoring the feeling of the warm water running down her skin and through her fur. She lathered shampoo into her hair, careful to coat all of it. She also applied some to one of the sponges and tossed her tail up, bending around to grab it and run some shampoo through it. She also made sure to rub a little through her mane at the small of her back, and along some of her fur. It didn&#39;t really help her fur much, but it smelled good.<br />
<br />
She washed it off tail-first, swishing it in the jet from her main showerhead. She then repeated with conditioner and soaped down her human skin. She contorted her way around applying equine conditioner to the rest of her body, rubbing it in as well as she could. Jen definitely preferred when she could have a friend over to really scrub her fur clean, but day-to-day she made do well enough on her own. <br />
<br />
After washing herself fully clean, she stepped out, wrapping a large towel over her equine half and a smaller one around her torso. She blew dry her hair, applied some moisturizers, and stepped back into her bedroom. She put on her bra, and then got to thinking about what she wanted to wear that day. It was a warm day near the end of the school year, and the final sports game was going to be in a week!<br />
<br />
She started to rummage for something, but she couldn&#39;t find it. As her search became more frantic (and loud), she heard a knock at her door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie, you alright in there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, Mom! I&#39;m fine! I just can&#39;t find-&quot;<br />
 &quot;Find what?&quot; Her mom stepped in, concerned. Her half-horse daughter stood in the middle of her disaster area of a room, made even more of one by her frantic searching.<br />
<br />
&quot;M...my cheer uniform...?&quot; She *was* the head cheerleader, right? Confusion flashed over her eyes.<br />
<br />
Her mom came forward, and wrapped her arms around Jen&#39;s torso. &quot;You always wanted to be a cheerleader, huh, Jen?&quot; What was going on? Am I not one? Her thoughts raced.<br />
<br />
&quot;A... I am! Though!&quot; Jen was sure! Why else did she have all those memories of... who was her name? Hannah? Or was it Hayleigh... and the football game in... where was it? Memories disappeared from her brain like sand through her fingers.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mom had a pained, loving expression as she looked up at her daughter. &quot;Maybe if we entered you into a riding competition, dear, but you&#39;ve always been more of a tr-.&quot; <br />
<br />
<i>TRACK AND FIELD!</i><br />
<br />
The memories that only seconds earlier had been evaporating before her eyes started flooding back in, but they were... different. She could tell, even if she couldn&#39;t explain why. New faces, people she&#39;d seen in hallways but hadn&#39;t known prior, were now close companions. Josie, Emma, Derek... all the people she&#39;d trained with, practiced with, ran with. Granted, she could never compete, due to, well, being a horse where it mattered for the sport. But that didn&#39;t change her passion for running. Suddenly the posters in her room made sense! The largest were of triple crown-winning horses, and some of her other favorites adorned the walls, along with some baseball cards. Apparently she played softball now, too? Weird, she thought, her inner monologue instantly adjusting. She&#39;d always played softball, since she was a filly, though she also didn&#39;t compete. Nor did she want to, not wanting to crush someone if the stakes were too high.<br />
<br />
She thought for a moment about the cheerleaders, and previously hilarious and cherished memories of practice, of bullying nerds, sneaking out and meeting the football players, and hanging out were... gone. Instead, apparently she was one of the targets of their ire, in no doubt to her uniqueness. She was still confused by the swirl of memories, two universes colliding, and her mother patted her on her equine shoulder, muttering something. She zoned back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that, Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, must not have spoken up. I said breakfast&#39;s ready when you want it, Jen.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her mom smiled and turned, leaving her room. Jen stood there, still trying to sort through what was real and what was imagined, she had to assume. Maybe it was a dream, being a cheerleader? It must have been. An unsettling emotion settled over her psyche.<br />
<br />
As she looked for a suitable shirt, another thought popped into her head. Almost none of her shirts were as showy as she remembered? A ton of flannel, some band shirts, lots of nerdy shit. A few tank tops here and there, but not a crop top in sight! Who was she? And where were her pants? Skirts? Anything to cover her bottom half?? As soon as the thought entered her mind, another combated it. Why would she need pants? Horses don&#39;t wear clothes, so why should she? Her fur kept her warm enough down there, anyway, and shielded her skin from the sun, so why should she put anything on? Somehow, this made sense to her, though in the back of her mind she was screaming about going around half-naked. She tried to shrug it off, but couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Eventually she found a nice shirt, and stuffed her track uniform into her backpack. It was a band shirt of some sort, some band she&#39;d never heard of b-had seen live last year! Of course she remembers, she stood in the merch line for an hour for this one! <br />
<br />
Tossing the shirt on, she tied her hair back, put on a hat, and took a moment to look at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
She stood almost 7 and a half feet tall. Her blonde hair was pulled into a fitting ponytail, topped by a baseball cap with a local college&#39;s logo on the front. Her mane poked out from below her shirt, a matching blonde. Her lovely brown coat shone after her shower. A single white sock came halfway up her left foreleg. She couldn&#39;t deny that that was her staring back at her, but it felt odd, almost terrifying, to be looking at herself this high up. &quot;Weren&#39;t I... shorter? And human! I&#39;m attached to a horse! Why are my nostrils that big, and why ARE MY EARS TWITCHING??&quot; Her thoughts raced, though only for a moment, as she snapped back into reality. &quot;WHAT is going on with me today, why does everything feel... weird?&quot; She stared at her reflection, puzzled. Her blonde tail swished behind her, and put her at ease. <br />
<br />
She sighed, and made her way to the kitchen, her hooves clopping beneath her. Whatever her worries were about, they couldn&#39;t be solved on an empty stomach, her parents always said. And now that her mother mentioned it, something did smell good in there...</p>
