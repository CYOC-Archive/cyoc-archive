<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you push hard against the cold stone door, you begin filling your mind with images of yourself.<br />
<br />
Your a healthy male, with a great build. You got into bodybuilding to help your stress after an accident when you were a kid that killed your brother. You are, however, very self-conscious of both socialising and your body, lots of people criticise or laugh at you because of this. Your parents like to space themselves from you because of both, the accident (that they blame you for) and because they don&#39;t like how you towers over them in terms of size and muscles.<br />
<br />
They hated you, for being a weak, pathetic nobody when you were younger and now, when you started to improve, they hate you for stealing the spot of perfect child from your brother.<br />
<br />
*Yeesh, major parent issues you have there? But your body&#39;s nice and strong, something good to have when around someone like me. Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself, kid, your probably the envy of many people*<br />
<br />
You wince at his truth. your have something amazing and you take it for granted, and your self-conscious issue makes your life much harder, but there&#39;s still a lot going for you. You have short blonde hair in a crew cut. You also have a strong face with a defined square jaw and a clear, soft face as well as soft baby blue eyes. A lot of girls try to get you to date them because of this but your secretly gay, something you could never tell anyone, especially not your parents. Your personality is also another great trait. You are a kind individual, devoid of any malice or evil. Of course you have some hatred to some people in your life, especially your parents but what human doesn&#39;t?<br />
<br />
As you muse over your weak strong points as well as other traits, the stone door starts to give way underneath your constant pushing. With an eerie and loud groan, the door pushes enough inward that you can comfortably walk inside.<br />
<br />
*Air! I can smell the fresh... ish... air! Oh, um... please don&#39;t be put off by my appearance. Its been over two thousand years since I have been able to move, let alone walk. The wards the monks put on my tomb have... diminished both my body and powers.*<br />
<br />
You nod, and begin making your way inside. It is a spacious area, filled with burnt out candle sticks and incense. Torn scrolls covered the walls, obviously made from the demon&#39;s attempt at escape. The small blue fire ball makes its way over to the middle of the area. The sound of heavy chains scrapping on the stone floor echo and bounce off the walls around you. &quot;Well don&#39;t just sound there looking in awe,&quot; a loud, deep and demonic like voice calls from the center, &quot;hurry up and make your way over here. Time is of the essence and we need to act fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice puts you off slightly. It was certainly the same voice you heard in your head throughout this little endeavor. But it was as if the voice was much stronger now. With some time you manage to find you feet again and begin walking once more.<br />
<br />
What you see shocks you. In the middle of this demon chamber, covered in heavy chains from head to foot, was a demon bigger than you could have ever imagined. The demons body, while covered in scratch&#39;s, was mostly the perfect body, anybody would want, his body bulged everywhere from impossibly big muscles, the most prominent being his massive pectorals and 8 pack below. His hands and feet ended in sharp claws that could cut through steel and his large tail was strong and quick, great for fights, his wings were large and sturdy, with spikes sticking out the top.<br />
<br />
His face however, was the part that really caught you attention, the strong jaw, devoid of any stubble (you don&#39;t think demons can grow hair anyway), his fiery red eyes burned bright as they looked into your soul, the lack of a nose looks almost natural on it and the mouth, that currently shows a small, mostly hidden smirk was enchanting. The demon standing in front of you now could easily kill you using its bare hands.<br />
<br />
He had short dark black hair, in a sort of crew cut like yours. He wears oddly hunan clothing that that consist of a zip up hoodie, left open to show his pecs and abs, small shorts that covered down a bit below the legs, it gave quite a clear view of the demons lower parts that looked huge but an average size while on his body. &quot;Having fun? Because I know I am&quot; The demon asks in mock humor. He smiles once, revealing another demon trait. He had long sharp canines that protruded outward, like a vampires. &quot;Lets get started. First I need strength so that I can break these chains and take us out of this horrible place.&quot;<br />
<br />
He motions for you to kneel next to him, and you do. &quot;What I am about to do,&quot; he explains, &quot;will bind us together forever. We will both live as immortals... that is as long as I live. Once I die, you shall begin to age the amount you have survived for. For example, if I live for three hundred years and then I am slain, then you will age three hundred years... probably dissolving into dust in the aftermath.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shudder at the thought, which causes the demon god to smile again. &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; he says in a confident voice, &quot;I don&#39;t intend in dieing any time soon. Now then, lets get started. Repeat after me...&quot;<br />
<br />
He clears his voice and speaks in a very regal and heroic tone, the voice also holds some charm that would make almost all the lady&#39;s on campus swoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, (place name here), here by swear by this oath. By binding myself to this demon I swear that I will in no way try to harm him. He and I are one, partners in life and death. We protect each other like one protects their family. And should this bound nature ever be threatened I here by swear that I will do my best to keep it from being torn apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
You repeat, word for word what the demon has instructed. As you say this you feel your body beginning to fill with some kind of heat. But it isn&#39;t uncomfortable, in fact it is very relaxing.<br />
<br />
The demon smiles and begins saying his part in the contract. But you are unable to understand it, for it is in some kind of demonic language.<br />
<br />
Once he ends, the demon looks down on you with a hopeful grin. &quot;Okay, now the last part. The exchange of blood to seal the pact.&quot; Suddenly the demon takes his lip into his mouth and takes a swift bite. Blood begins ebbing from the wound. &quot;Now, let me take in some of your blood, then you need to take in some of mine. Eer... me taking yours is easier because all I have to do is bite you. But um... because I am chained to the floor here... you kind of... have to take this blood from where I have bitten myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blush slightly at the notion, but nod anyway seeing the logic in the situation. You give him your hand, allowing him to take a small bite and draw in some of your blood. &quot;Now you.&quot; he orders.<br />
<br />
You slowly make your way up to his lips, having to support your self with one of your hands on what you thought was his shoulder, but was actually one of his steel pecs. The demon smirks as he see&#39;s this but says nothing. You reach the demons lip, the blood is red, like a humans. But as you slip your tongue over the wound you find it very tasty. In fact you can&#39;t get enough of it! Suddenly you are mashing your lips onto his, trying to draw in as much blood as possible. Suddenly the flow of blood stops. You sit up, looking at the demon bewildered. &quot;Sorry...&quot; he says in a strong, sturdy tone voice, &quot;I forgot how good out kinds blood tastes.&quot; As he says this, his smirk never wither&#39;s, making you wonder wether he actually forgot or not.<br />
<br />
You blush again and nod, trying your best to keep from looking at the creature. He just shrugs and begins testing himself against the chains. &quot;Well it doesn&#39;t matter. The deal has been done, and I have fed on some blood. I should have enough power to do... this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the chains around you shatter in unison, sending shrapnel around your body, but thankfully not hitting you. The godly demon sits up, your head only coming up to his lower abs while you both stand. &quot;Yes, yes!! I am finally free!&quot; He turns to you and throws his arms around your body, picking you up and pulling you towards his body. &quot;Thank you... thank you so much!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You are confused, but slowly you wrap your arms around the creature as far as you can, giving as much comfort to him as you can.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-we...&quot; he sniffles, &quot;We should get going. Hold on tight to me okay? I am going to use some of my power to take us out of here. We won&#39;t be able to go far... but there is a spot that I think is safe enough... hold on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room began to swim and spin. All of the walls begin to swirl and transform into different colors. It takes all of your strength just to stay conscious of the disorienting space travel. As you find yourself drifting into a state of darkness the room stop spinning and the smell of fresh grass and trees surround you.<br />
<br />
As you drift off, you see the demon you saved put you down onto the ground before picking you up again, carrying you bridal style as he smiles down at you.</p>
