<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You crash land into what appears to be asphalt, smashing a huge crater into the ground. It hurt... kinda bad... Lucky you were wearing armor, but it only did so much. Slowly, shakily, you stand up in your crater to get a grip on your surroundings. You seemed to have ended up within some kind of facsimile of a big city, possibly Japanese. There were human guests staring at you, flabbergasted as all heck and, my goodness thankfully, completely unharmed. Mascots stared at you as well, but they weren&#39;t like most other mascots you&#39;ve ever seen before. These ones were human-like, but they seemed more inspired by eastern animation than western ones, and not a Popeye arm between them either. You did remember hearing about there being anime style mascots at some point, but this is pretty much your first time seeing them in person.<br />
<br />
For a fantasy land denizen such as yourself, it was like you wound up on a completely different planet.<br />
<br />
The people around you were talking anxiously. Was stuff like this supposed to happen? Was this park actually dangerous? Why wasn&#39;t there any debris from that crater? Even when crazy dangerous things happen, none of the humans ever got hurt! What even is up with these mascots?!<br />
<br />
A gaggle of what you presumed to be magical girls appeared to attend to the rattled guests, assuring them that everything was okay and that the park had literally no intention of harming any guest ever. One magical girl appeared before you to attend to your injury and to fix the street. With a wave of her magic wand she filled in the crater and made you feel good as new. She had sparkly purple eyes, a pair of brown ponytails, and was dressed in a purple outfit that was something of a cross between a ballerina and a stage magician, complete with top hat.<br />
<br />
&quot;That should do the trick!&quot; she exclaimed, stowing away her wand with a flourish, &quot;You feeling okay, mister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking over yourself, you nodded and answered with an affirmative &quot;Yes, absolutely! What should I call my savior?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The name&#39;s Cutie Magician Korina-chan!&quot; she declared cheerfully, &quot;What&#39;s your name, mister knight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, &#39;Mister Knight&#39; was my father,&quot; you reply with that joke, &quot;I am Sir Hammer of Fantasy Kingdom, though Hamm for short is fine too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantasy Kingdom?&quot; Korina mused, &quot;That part of Whimsy World&#39;s all the way on the other end of the park! How&#39;d you get from there to here so fast, Hammer-kun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Catapult,&quot; you explain briefly, &quot;So... where did I end up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where? Why this is Tokyopolis, anime capitol of Whimsy World of course,&quot; Korina declared, &quot;This is where most of us anime-type mascots come from. Would you like some help getting home, Hammer-kun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please,&quot; you say, &quot;but could we possibly take the scenic route? I kinda want to see the sights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course!&quot; Korina nods, &quot;C&#39;mon! I&#39;ll show you around!&quot; With that, she led the way. As the pair of you went, the people seemed to be reassured and safe, happy with the way things worked here now, even eager to take pictures with you and Korina. Even in such a far flung land like this, you were a mascot, and it was up to you to make these guests feel special, a job you were all too happy to undertake.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;God, this place is so saccharine it hurts,&quot; Agent N exasperatedly exclaimed, &quot;Why do we always end up with the kiddie themed threats to the economy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s just our station,&quot; Agent Q consoled his taller co-worker. These two spies may have been assigned as mother and child for this mission, but they still stood out with their form fitting black business suits and dark sunglasses. Heck, Agent Q still sounded like a grown-up! Despite this, nobody assumed that they were suspicious, even though they were aware that they weren&#39;t mascots.<br />
<br />
&quot;I joined up with the company to foil third-world counterfeiters,&quot; Agent N complained to her smaller superior officer, &quot;Not ruin the lives of beloved childhood heroes! God damned crotchety old boss... frickin&#39; humbugs, the whole department.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Q sipped on a soda, patting his &quot;mother&#39;s&quot; leg sympathetically, &quot;There there, Agent N. It&#39;s alright. Besides, no one there knows we&#39;re getting those magic guys on the side of the actual government anyway. Their only interest seemed to be making people&#39;s lives happy anyway, so of course we had to help. When we busted the Tooth Fairy was busted for counterfeit quarters, who set her up with that secret government funded contract that allowed her to circulate real money instead?&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent N sighed, &quot;We did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When Santa Claus was shot down for selling convincing knock-offs, who helped him land a legitimate distribution deal with all the product companies so that millions of kids&#39; hearts didn&#39;t get broken on Christmas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did, thank god,&quot; Agent N stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the Easter Bunny was caught for delivering imitation candy, who set him up with a distribution deal on the up and up so that people&#39;s hopes in spring coming would stay intact?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did!&quot; Agent N smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, partner!&quot; Agent Q exclaimed, &quot;So long as heartless monsters attempt to ruin the lives of magical guardians for any reason at all, we, the Coalition of Childhood Figure Defense will always be there to make sure this godforsaken world never loses the people who give people hope. So chin up, Nancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Agent N nodded, &quot;but we still need to figure out if this place has any vulnerabilities the department could exploit. I don&#39;t want this place shut down any more that the weird cartoon characters who live here would, but we still gotta get paid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Agent Q sighed, &quot;and they&#39;ll know if we make stuff up too. We&#39;ll still figure out a way to get this place on the real government&#39;s side though. For the kids, y&#39;know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Agent N agreed, &quot;I just hope for our sake, and the rest of the world&#39;s, that the department never finds out about our being double agents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like that&#39;ll ever happen,&quot; Agent Q brushed off over confidently, &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go inspect that Halloween area. We haven&#39;t checked there, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;Woo-ee! This city sure is something!&quot; you do declare as Korina led you through the mock Shibuya Crosswalk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it though?&quot; Korina exclaimed, &quot;How&#39;d you find the Pokemon Stadium? Did you know that the Pokemon are actually solid-vision projections? Same with the Duel Monsters Arenas. It really makes the battles come to life, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how! That dragon&#39;s breath felt so real!&quot; You munched on a crepe as you walked. &quot;And the food here is delicious too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should try the ramen next time you&#39;re ever in town,&quot; Korina recommended, &quot;It&#39;s SOOO good, just like it came from a real Tokyo noodle stall!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and how about those cute kiddos who wanted your autograph?&quot; you point out, &quot;You must be really famous, Korina!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D&#39;aww, you&#39;re so sweet, Hammer-kun!&quot; Korina blushed, &quot;But it is true, I am pretty popular. You should see how well my books, DVDs, and figures sell. How popular are you back home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty popular,&quot; you suppose, &quot;I know I have plushies, but maybe I have books and DVDs like you, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be so cool!&quot; Korina smiled, &quot;You should study up on your merch when you get the chance. You&#39;ll find out stuff about yourself you might not have even known about!&quot;<br />
<br />
You conversed cheerfully like this until you got to your destination. It was a futuristic looking terminal called the Whimsy Whisker™. This was used to quickly teleport guests and mascots alike to different parts of the park, so long as one had a Fast Pass or didn&#39;t want to walk. Lucky for you, mascots are the exception to the Fast Pass rule due to their technical employee status. This should get you back home in a jiffy!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks for showing me around, Korina,&quot; you bow for the magical girl, &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll get to visit you again someday!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, Hammer-kun,&quot; Korina agreed, &quot;Crossovers are totally accepted in Whimsy World, but mostly in small doses. You know how a little kid takes toys of characters from different universes and have them play together? It&#39;s kinda like that! It&#39;s all in good fun and the guests get a kick out of it too! I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll meet again. Safe travels, Hammer-kun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep fighting the good fight, Korina-chan!&quot; you wave as you stepped forward into the terminal door labeled &quot;Fantasy Kingdom&quot;. Time to go home.</p>
