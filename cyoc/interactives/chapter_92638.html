<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment Alex clicked go, everyone was teleported into a large room, the defense into another. Each side had 4 hours to prepare their case and the accusing lawyer had a lot of testimonies to go through but did it expertly. each person was called into the room with the lawyer and discussed their experience. Alex went first and described in detail how this started. the lawyer raised her eyebrow a few times when he described some of the more deplorable things and then he went back to the waiting room with the others, calling the next witness.<br />
<br />
The time flew by and the trial began. The lawyer women made their opening statements, apparently his mother&#39;s defense is that she was looking out for her family and trying to have a vacation of sorts which she states she earned through years of hardship and thankless childrearing.<br />
<br />
Although Alex and the lawyer knew this, his father still thought he had no children, because Alex was turned into a butler before he had gotten home. All the former staff members were forced to sit politely and quietly so the trial could proceed but the torture of not knowing who in this room was his child was clearly weighing on him.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s father was called to the stand to bring into question how loving of a woman his mother was, upon entering the stand he was able to speak completely freely and began asking questions.<br />
<br />
The layer and judge interjected and told him that he is there to answer questions not ask them, all will be answered soon.<br />
<br />
Because Dad was barely able to function on anything other than his paternity, he was asked if he knew he was a father before this trial began to which he replied no. The lawyer turned to the rest of the courtroom and asked if the child of this man would stand and Alex rose and said, &quot;I am your son, Alex.&quot; Sobrieski stood as well, his mouth agape and his body was slowly reverting to his former self. The bright red hair slowly darkening and his muscles weren&#39;t quite as large as Alex remembered.<br />
<br />
You? he asked horrified. Turning directly at his wife, You made me lose any memory of even having a son? <br />
<br />
There were horrified gasps from the jury box and his mother flushed red and put her head into her hands. <br />
<br />
The lawyer asked what it was like for him to be, for all intents and purposes, trapped in the body of another man? His fathers testimony was raw and filled with contempt. As his testimony continued he became more and more the father Alex knew, his face now wrinkled with laugh lines, wearing his usual business suit, his eyes belied the composure he was trying to maintain. No longer gay, he kept glancing at &quot;Simms&quot; wishing he could remember what his son looked like.<br />
<br />
The defense called Alex up and asked his perception of his mother before this experience. He answered honestly and said she was the person he trusted most in this world, she was always there for him and he would have gone to the ends of the earth for her. <br />
<br />
So in your own words could you please describe what the chronivac can do?<br />
Alex sat perplexed for a moment trying to find the words to describe every potential use for the machine... ummm, anything?<br />
The defense lawyer whirled around facing the jury, &quot;So imagine your child, Came to YOU. And showed YOU that they had in their possession, a machine, that could start wars, facilitate rape, corrupt governments, give them access to porn, or drugs, or power, or they could LITERALLY get away with murder. What is a mother to do? Surely, leaving a device in the hand of your teenaged son is not wise.&quot; She gestured at Alex who had been slowly regressing and now looked mid 20s and significantly thinner. Alex&#39;s father was watching avidly. His memories will be restored when Alex is fully restored.<br />
<br />
&quot;So she did what ANY mother would do. She thought quick to protect her young. Her child&#39;s free will brought this dangerous machine into the house, so she must take his free will away. She kept him safe in the house and gave him chores. these are not the actions of a criminal, but of a loving mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
The prosecutions lawyer stood up to cross examine the witness. Now Alex, you invited a friend over to see this device, is that correct?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Miranda&quot;, Alex pointed to the french maid. &quot;Why did you invite her over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the program was neat and I didn&#39;t want to use it alone, I know its powerful and didnt want things to get out of hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you didn&#39;t want to, start a war?&quot; Alex was caught of guard, &quot;no.&quot; &quot;What about murder? was there anyone you wanted to murder before your mother did this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex wasnt the most popular kid in school and he had his run ins with bullies but never wanted to kill anyone. &quot;Definitely not!&quot; Although Alex didnt realize it he was still regressing, now about 18, his goatee was becoming less dense by the minute, and he was beginning to shrink, no longer a fully grown adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what were you thinking of using the Chronivac for? Was it rape?&quot; <br />
<br />
The look of horror and disgust that crossed Alex&#39;s face was accentuated by the innocence pouring off of his now, not needing to be shaven face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, of course not. we were just about to start playing with the machine, maybe change outfits, hair color and style. After that I thought maybe we could bring the carnival to town and Miranda an I could...&quot; Alex looked at the french maid and blushed, &quot;go on a date...&quot; Alex realized the room had more than him the lawyer and Miranda in it and stammered. &quot;or.. or we could just go as friends, that would be fun too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lawyer faced the jury, &quot;the defense would have you believe that she was protecting the world from her evil mastermind son, but really she was selfishly ruining a blossoming young relationship that her son was beginning to build. In reality, the world needed protecting from her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, you may sit back down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex got up and went back to the bench where the former staff members were, his father, now recognized him and, although they couldnt be loud, tears were streaming down his face. Probably because of the horror of what had been done to them and the joy of being reunited with his son. They embraced and he reassured Alex that everything would be all right. Alex knew it would be, being on the stand was just more intense than he imagined.<br />
<br />
It turned out that Mario the Italian lover, husband of Miranda the maid, impromptu Chef, that Alex caught his mother with in the kitchen was originally the mailman. He was married and had children, but was forced into having sex with the mistress and Miranda as well as missing work, this may have very well cost him his job and family.<br />
<br />
The poolboy was brought up to the stand and explained how it was the funnest pool party he had ever went to! Everyone was really nice and he got to drink wine and and everyone liked him dancing and he had a great time. He was just a little confused about what his pee pee was doing and he didn&#39;t understand why his mom didnt recognize him but was going to put him to bed in the middle of the day.<br />
<br />
By the time the inquiry was over, the extremely handsome and sexual, 21 year old poolboy was reduced to a very innocent 9 year old in pool shorts and floaties.<br />
<br />
Another poolboy was a friend of Alex&#39;s who had stopped by shortly after this whole thing started. He enjoyed being hot and legal and didnt mind having sex with Alex&#39;s mom one bit. He got to drink wine and fuck, and was the object of all the ladies&#39; affection at the pool party and he absolutely loved every second. No geometry homework for this Sophomore, just crazy hot sexy time!<br />
<br />
Glancing at his mother she was flushed with embarrassment by the time his testimony was done. How did she do what she did with him, she didnt know.<br />
<br />
Everyone had a chance to speak, everyone was examined and cross examined, and reverted to normal while giving their testimony. Nobody noticed as hours and hours passed, their bodies gave no protest.<br />
<br />
Finally Alex&#39;s mother was called to the stand. She reiterated all her fears as she recounted what had transpired. When first given control over the chronivac she acted out of fear to protect her child from losing himself to the machine. Then as the days wore on it was more and more difficult to keep the machine secret. Alex&#39;s friend stopped by looking for he son who didnt exist any longer. the mailman asked how she got the renovations done from one day to the next. Once she finally got her family safe it was time to continue teaching them. Being her servants was only the beginning, She would teach her husband to lust for her the way he lusted after Simms, her son would get some sexual experience starting with Sobrieski and eventually moving up through Mario, and then onto Miranda eventually taking Mario&#39;s place as her husband. Miranda would get some attention too, as the only other woman in the house Miranda would get to go out shopping and being treated with the mistress and was adored by most of the staff. Alex&#39;s mother hadnt decided what she would do with the 9 year old pool boy or even if she would keep him on staff. As for Alex&#39;s friend, she was thinking an orgy would be fun to watch and occasionally participate in.<br />
<br />
Alex watched as the jury reacted to the things she was saying, he had taken the liberty to compel his mother into truthfulness as he no longer trusted her. The closing statements were made and the jury was released to deliberate, everyone was able to take a break. Since nobody needed to eat or pee or stretch or nap, Alex took this time to start meeting with the former staff members privately with the chronivac to prepare their lives for their return. The first was the mailman, he set it up so his absence was thought to be due to the illness and then passing of his elderly uncle. He can return to his family and job without interruption and wont remember being trapped in someone else&#39;s body and having tons of sex.<br />
<br />
Next was his friend turned poolboy. His friend wanted to keep the body, the life, the memories but Alex reminded him that the poolboy doesnt exist as a person. No id, No SSN, and although he&#39;s cute now, one day he will be old and fatter, and will want to have a high school and maybe even a college diploma. &quot;Fine, but I had sex and I want to remember it, I also want to look a little older.&quot; Alex rolled his eyes and began typing, his friend was a late bloomer and his parents still tried passing him off as a 13 year old for the kids discounted meals, so Alex understood why he was asking for these things. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, when the trial is over and you go back to your life, you will be mostly through puberty. You will easily be able to pass for a muscular college sophomore rather than an average highschool one, additionally you will remember having great sex though wont remember who with or how to contact them recalling only that you had too much wine at the party. Your closet, pictures, and life will mold around your new image, you will probably need to shave daily and nobody will realize anything is different, including me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex could tell that his friend wanted to ask for more and feigned disappointment at not remembering all the details about his sexual conquests. His eyes sparkled at being told he will no longer pass as a 13 year old and he was giddy upon leaving the room.<br />
<br />
Following the trial the 9 year old poolboy as well as the other guests, jurors, and judge were going to be transported home with no memory of what transpired.<br />
<br />
Alex called Miranda in, she was now back to her original self after weeks of torture and oppression. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry this happened. I have set everyone else up to forget what happened and go on with their lives. My father and I will be part of the judgement. So my mother may remain, or become a family pet, or something else entirely. I don&#39;t know if I am going to stay a high school student after this, I dont know if I can trust people anymore and dont know if I want to erase my own memories and start over or set myself up with a nice life and get a place of my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I send you back to your life, do you have any preferences as to what you think happened over the last couple months of your life? I was thinking domestic exchange student where you could learn about the culture and lifestyle of a different part of America? Or foreign exchange to another English speaking country like Australia or England? I dont know, did you want to learn a foreign language, I can make it so you have already learned French or Spanish and you could travel to France or Spain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda just sat there, tears welling up in her eyes. During her testimony, she and the mailman had sex multiple times and she was trapped screaming internally, while her body begged for more, and laughed, and cuddled. The thought of making all that just disappear somehow seemed to just be brushing the trauma under the rug and further violated her sense of self. Adding to it the fact that the person standing before her claimed to have interest in her well being and had wanted to date her! <br />
<br />
&quot;Please say something Miranda. I don&#39;t know what you are thinking and I&#39;m just trying to make it better the only way I know how.&quot; With that, Miranda flew out of her chair and out the door, sobbing. With a heavy sigh Alex did what he thought was best and made it so she would have been in Australia the last few months, seeing the sights and exploring the great barrier reef. &quot;I hope she appreciates it when it&#39;s done...&quot;, Alex thought to himself.<br />
<br />
All that was left for him to fix was himself his dad and his mom... with idle curiosity he pulled up his profile and looked through it. Going through the mental traits he found a graph that showed his mental maturity and was a little alarmed to see that over the last 8 weeks he had mentally aged a decade. The stress of the situation made him grow. Pulling up Miranda&#39;s page she had regressed back to a scared 9 year old mentally. No wonder he wanted to move out and she wanted to curl into a ball and cry. A hot tear rolled down his face and an anger welled up within him. His mother hurt everyone he cared about and then some. He was reassured that he made the right choice for Miranda, but still didnt know what to do about himself or his family.<br />
<br />
A bell began ringing that a verdict had been found. They were all ushered inside and took their seats, they rose as the judge came in and then sat back down. The judge took a moment to explain that once the verdict is delivered sentencing will be carried out by the chronivac device itself. There are two things that the Jury was to determine, were the actions of the defendant malicious, and how heinous were her crimes (0-100%).<br />
<br />
Has the Jury reached a verdict?<br />
<br />
One of the jurors rose, &quot;We have your honor.&quot;</p>
