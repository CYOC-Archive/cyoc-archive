<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Natsuki studied the items in the shop, and smiled. &quot;I think you&#39;d make a cute deer boy.. Maybe a nice, radiant stallion, maybe a cute, little cunt boy for my throbbing tiger cock to erupt and fuck into oblivion.&quot;<br />
You blushed at hearing these things being spoken about you.<br />
<br />
As she continued to speak, she walked up to one of the shelves, examining several different cursed items. Some had curses attached to them, some didn&#39;t, all looked rather interesting. She picked up a couple of pieces, before setting them aside after glancing at their descriptions. One was a deer horn, with a inscription the shopkeeper had called &#39;Cursed inscription of the Aura of Lust&#39;, which caused its wearer to sexually arouse passerbys whenever they encountered someone or something they considered attractive. Another, labeled as a collar, allowed anyone wearing it to control others around them without touching them directly.<br />
<br />
However, neither seemed right for her. Instead, Natsuki turned her attention to a small glass bottle filled with purple liquid. At first glance, it appeared to contain nothing but water inside it, save for a single drop resting at the very top. But upon closer inspection, she realized it held something else entirely. Something far more dangerous.<br />
<br />
It contained the essence of a curse.<br />
&quot;Hmm... This might work,&quot; she mused aloud, picking it up carefully. It clinked faintly as it fell against her palm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty then! Time to get started~&quot;<br />
Natsuki grinned cheerfully, looking over the various items laid out on the table. There were many strange ones here; most of them were harmless, though there were a fair share of cursed objects too. Many of those could cause harm or even death depending on how they were used, including the odd &#39;Lust Aura&#39; charm she had been eyeing earlier. Though it would certainly turn heads, she wasn&#39;t sure what use it actually served. Still, perhaps it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try it out anyway.<br />
<br />
There was also a variety of collars and chains scattered amongst the rest. Most of them weren&#39;t particularly useful, given the amount of magical energy needed to activate them properly, but a few caught her eye. One in particular stood out, an ornate silver chain adorned by a large gemstone set within. Its enchantment allowed the owner to control people nearby, without physically touching them. That alone made it quite tempting. If she wanted to force you into doing anything, she could simply enchant it to do so.<br />
<br />
But, if she really wanted to go the distance, she should look elsewhere. A simple piece of jewelry couldn&#39;t possibly satisfy such a lustful creature as herself. No, she&#39;d need to take matters much further than that. And since this was a cursed item shop, why not give it a shot?<br />
She placed the necklace back onto the shelf, moving on to examine another option instead. Perhaps a cursed item that changed you into a wolf? Or a fox, perhaps? She smirked slightly as she thought about it, turning away from the rack to search through the other shelves.<br />
<br />
Her eyes stopped dead in their tracks when she spotted something peculiar. In front of her, sitting on a wooden stand, sat a small, black cube. Upon closer examination, she noticed that it was carved with runes etched deep into its surface, glowing softly in the dim lighting provided by the room&#39;s lamps. The markings themselves were unfamiliar to her, though she knew enough to recognize them as magic-based. They were similar to the symbols she had seen on the collar in the cage earlier. Curious, she reached forward and touched one of the lines lightly with her fingertip. Instantly, the glow faded, revealing a dark void behind it.<br />
<br />
A portal?<br />
Perhaps it was merely a trap meant to lure customers in, but Natsuki found herself intrigued nonetheless. With no better ideas, she picked it up gingerly, inspecting the rune-carved edges closely once again. Then, with a quick motion, she threw it towards the center of the storeroom. As soon as it left her hand, however, it began to grow rapidly in size until finally exploding open. An instant later, it vanished completely.<br />
<br />
In its place, a new door appeared before her. It was plain white, and bore no signs of any runes or sigils upon it. It just looked like a regular door, albeit somewhat larger than normal doors usually did.<br />
<br />
The moment she stepped through, she found herself in a almost dreamlike mirror of the real world. Except instead of the buildings, stood only the trees and hills that were there before. And almost every human standing in the real world was transformed into a lusty fucking animal in the new one except for you. Your transformation is permanent.<br />
<br />
 Either way, she was already naked, and her arousal was apparent. She licked her lips hungrily, eyes glancing around eagerly. It was time to pounce on you and force your change...<br />
<br />
With a predatory smile, she stalked forwards.<br />
You felt your cock twitch beneath her tongue as she stroked you gently with her scraping tongue, feeling the warmth of her breath tickling at your sensitive head. Your heart beat faster as you stared down at her face, watching her lick along the shaft lazily, making little sounds as she worked. You couldn&#39;t help but feel yourself getting hard, despite all efforts not too, breathing in the pheromone laced air and her cursed necklace on her throat seeming to make her stronger and more bestial like a wild tigeress every moment and she seemed to notice, giggling quietly.<br />
&quot;I can see that I&#39;m going to be needing some help making you into the perfect thing to satisfy me, Darling. . .&quot;</p>
