<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided to have himself a good time at Bunky's Gym. He earned himself a free workout, so he figured he <br />
might as well enjoy himself. He walked over to the front of the vast weight room, where the treadmills and the <br />
stationary bikes were positioned neatly side-by-side, and he decided to sit on one of the bikes at the very <br />
end so that he wouldn't be bothered. On the other hand, he was seated on the bike which was the closest to the <br />
door, so he would see every single person who would come in and leave the weight room area.<br />
<br />
Ty started pedaling and just looked around, as he stuck his ear buds in his ears and selected an album on his <br />
iPod Touch music player. A few minutes had gone by, when two people walked through the door. It was a father <br />
and his teenage son. They had sparked Ty's interest, so Ty paused the song on his iPod so he could listen in <br />
on the conversation between the man, his son, and the trainer.<br />
<br />
It was obviuous that the trainer was giving a newcomer's tour of the facility. These two were new members and <br />
they had just signed up. Interesting! The man was over six feet tall, he had a bit of a beer guy and he had a <br />
bald spot on his head. He wore glasses and he came dressed wearing a t-shirt and shorts. The kid was about 5 <br />
foot 6 inches tall, he looked like he was about fourteen years old, he had long straight jet black hair, he <br />
had long but skinny arms and skinny, thin legs. He was completely smooth and hairless. <br />
<br />
The trainer led the pair around the gym, showing them all the machines, the sauna, the locker room, the <br />
computer lab, the classroom, the aurobics room, and where the pool was located. Then, the father and son had <br />
filled out paperwork before returning to the weight room. They had dropped off their bags in the locker room <br />
and now they were ready for their very first workout at the gym.<br />
<br />
Ty was curious and he silently wished for the boy to suddenly have a desire to use the empty bike right next <br />
to his own.<br />
<br />
The boy then walked up to the bike and adjusted the seat. Then, he climbed on and looked at the display before <br />
turning towards Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Excuse me? Do you know how these machines work?&quot; the boy asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely! Just start pedaling and then press the Start button. Once the display comes up, press the number <br />
on the Level indicator and you're all set!&quot; Ty explained, while pointing to the diaplay. &quot;I'll help you, since <br />
I'm doing the same exercise as you. My name is Ty, by the way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Nice to meet you... I'm Isaiah!&quot; the boy replied.<br />
<br />
Then, the father walked up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't wear yourself out! This is your first day!&quot; he said to his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a little kid, dad! I can handle it!&quot; Isaiah replied.<br />
<br />
Ty just grinned. He could tell that the boy was annoyed by his overprotective father. Maybe it was time for <br />
the boy to become a little older and bigger... perhaps even a little bigger than the father? Then the boy <br />
could tell the father take it easy instead!<br />
<br />
Ty smiled as he silently wished for Isaiah to grow a year older and gain 10 pounds of muscle for every minute <br />
he exercises on the bike!<br />
<br />
The skinny boy, who probably weighed about 150 pounds, quietly started pedaling away. The timer on the bike <br />
started ticking as well, indicating the duration of the session. <br />
<br />
As the timer kept on running, the boy's legs started growing longer and his arms became stretched out as well. <br />
His torso grew wider and patches of hair started to sprout all over his chest, his arms, and his legs. His <br />
chest started to bulge outward a bit while biceps started to form. His calves also inflated, while his quads <br />
began to fill out his shorts very slowly. The timer indicated the first 5 minutes, so he had gained 5 years in <br />
age and 50 pounds in muscle!<br />
<br />
As time went on, more hair appeared on his arms, his legs, his chest, and even on his shin. The boy suddenly <br />
has a growth spurt, and starts growing taller and taller as well. His legs grow even longer as he gains more <br />
muscle at the same time while he continues to age as well. His voice grows deeper as a smooth mustache appears <br />
above his lips. The boy becomes a young man now, no longer a teenager. <br />
<br />
Ten minutes have passed and he has gained 100 pounds of muscle and he is now 24 years old. He weighs 250 <br />
pounds!<br />
<br />
Finally, he stops pedalling and looks at Ty. He is now 6 foot 3 inches tall, and as he gets off the bike, he <br />
towers over Ty as he shakes Ty's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for helping me!&quot; he says in a deep, baritone voice.<br />
<br />
Then, he walked up to his father, who was lifting dumbbells.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful, pops! Don't wear yourself out! This is our first day!&quot; the man said to his father, who was three <br />
inches shorter than him.<br />
<br />
Ty only laughed as he looked on from a distance.<br />
<br />
He was already wondering who to grow next...</p>
