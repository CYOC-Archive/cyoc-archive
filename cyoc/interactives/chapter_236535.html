<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer decided to drive back to home as she already failed. Getting shouted by her mom as the last thing she wished for at this point. So as she started to pick-up truck and drove next to her house. Her mom and client were waiting near the porch. The man smiled and told Jennifer to keep the car running.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be a good girl and take care of your sister.&quot; The man said as they swapped places.<br />
<br />
Silvia was quite confused as Jennifer came back all by herself and as the man left with his car Silvia stood up and walked next to her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweety, what&#39;s wrong... what happened? Where&#39;s the groceries you were supposed to pick?&quot; Silvia asked with a sweet tone from her daughter. &quot;And... have you been crying...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother gave her daughter a hug which opened the flood gates once more. Jennifer had been crying too many times that her eyes were getting dry. She tried to explained to her mother what had just happened but it just made her mother confused. Jennifer explained how she met a boy in the supermarket and that he bullied her which cause the store to kick her out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my sweet little baby girl. The world is cruel place sometime and some people are born evil.&quot; Silvia explained. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry that you had to go through it all. I&#39;m so glad that nothing happened to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt calmer and begun to forgot the encounter as she closed her eyes in her mother&#39;s chest. It was as soft as those fancy pillows in stores. Jennifer could only imagine how it felt to dream in a cozy bed and then passed out.<br />
<br />
The next moment Jennifer opened her eyes. It seemed that her mother had carried her to her mother&#39;s bedroom as they both slept. Jennifer had used her mother&#39;s breasts as a pillow and as she rubbed her eyes and crawled from her mother&#39;s bed to the window. The moonlight could only be seen from the window. Jennifer had slept the whole day and was not feeling fine. A weird spinning and twisting feeling begun to warp her vision as she saw the whole house distorting violently like a watercolor painting. <br />
<br />
She then turned her head to look at her mother who begun to shrink and youthen on top her own bed.<br />
<br />
&#39;Mom! No! Please don&#39;t get any...&#39; Jennifer thought in her own head as her mother was turning from her 25th birthday to 23rd birthday. &#39;If you get any younger than this it&#39;s... it&#39;s...&#39;<br />
<br />
Jennifer had to kneel down as the twisting became more violent. Her body shrunk in size as her body was compressed smaller. Her body lost all the weight she had gained but she could feel that she felt different. A year younger. Jennifer had to press her chest as it begun to grow in to a B-cup. A literal B-cups hanging from her body. Jennifer hips getting wider as if something were pulling them apart. She couldn&#39;t stand up and felt a cosmic force doing trick with her mind. A film reel of old memories getting erased, replaced and swapped around. Yesterday&#39;s event becoming muddy as she remember meeting with the boy yesterday but the place was like a dream to her.<br />
<br />
As she was finally able to move she watched as her mother wasn&#39;t noticing any of the changes on her body. She had kept get piercings from yesterday but a small nose piercing had popped in her skin. Then two barbels popped out of her mother&#39;s chest like mushroom in fast forward movement and lastly a row small piercing filled her mother&#39;s umkempt and hairy pussy one by one until two rows of four were filled. Tattoos from her mother&#39;s arms were slowly growing towards her neck and the small skull tattoo begun to grow forming a tribal-like legs around the skull&#39;s head. The heart tattoo also expanded to it&#39;s sides as it got massive and more colorful like an art piece than a funny little joke.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt something weird inside her own mouth. Like a pebble or a rock growing on top of her tongue. She sticked her tongue out and felt something round and hard there. Similar feeling was happened to her lower back just above her ass. It was like someone was drawing something on her skin. <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh... no...&#39; Jennifer thought to herself as she knew what they were.<br />
<br />
Silvia&#39;s hair got a bit short but she still had the same hairstyle as Jennifer looked in horror how her mother still kept transforming. Suddenly the walls begun to shrink and under Jennifer her mattress popped out in the same room where her mother&#39;s bed was. It seemed she was sleeping in the same room as her mother.<br />
<br />
She opened the door and saw that the whole house had gotten smaller. Only having a small kitchen and a toilet with the front door in the same eye distance. It only meant that they didn&#39;t have their own rooms but had to share the same room. All the clothes started to vanish one clothing piece at a time and were replaces with dirty cups and disposable cutlery. Jennifer&#39;s clothes also vanished, not even socks were spared, as she was fully naked on top of the mattress. She noticed how much hair she begun to grow as her bushy hair became bigger in volume, armpit hair begun grow bushier and the hair in her private parts were now reaching her stomach. <br />
<br />
In the corner of the room was a huge trash bag opened which was filled with to the brim with assortment of trash like pregnancy tests, used packages and chewed up gum, weird assortment of vitamins and pills and empty plastic bottles. Jennifer was sure that she saw these last time in the bathroom in the... in the...<br />
<br />
&#39;No way. We&#39;ve been living like this like... why can&#39;t remember... think Jenny, think...&#39; Jennifer had difficulties to remember the past houses she&#39;s been as they felt more of a dream than a reality. &#39;Anyway, that&#39;s the trash and I&#39;ve seen it now. No need to worry about TRASH.&#39;<br />
<br />
As Jennifer kept inspecting the room the only electric appliance was the laptop on top of the nightstand. It&#39;s camera pointing towards her mother&#39;s bed. Jennifer sighed in relief as she felt that all the changes had ran their course. She noticed a pink dildo next to her mother&#39;s bed wrapped loosely inside a towel still humming and buzzing quietly.<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t say or think anything as this has to be the rock bottom of her life. There&#39;s no way she can&#39;t afford anymore mistakes if their lives takes a grim turn for even a slight fuck-up. Jennifer had to go to the bathroom to think as her mother&#39;s loud snored were distracting her thoughts.</p>
