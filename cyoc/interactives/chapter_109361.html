<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I... I&#39;m leaving!” Aron shouted in defiance.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” James said pleasantly. Aron was taken aback.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re letting me go? Just like that?”<br />
<br />
“Sure. I was about to send you out anyway.” Aron eyed James suspiciously. This had to be a trick. Surely he knew that Aron was going to tell the police. Aron took a step towards the door, but James stepped in the way.<br />
<br />
“I thought you said I could leave!?”<br />
<br />
“But I haven&#39;t told you what I&#39;m sending you out for,” Aron knew there had to have been a caviat. But as long as he got to leave he&#39;d be fine.<br />
<br />
“What?” he asked, wanting to get this over with.<br />
<br />
“You are going to go home and confess to you family and friends that you&#39;re gay. You&#39;re going to do it with pride and a smile.”<br />
<br />
“No way!”<br />
<br />
“I haven&#39;t finished,” James said. “You are going to tell them what a slutty slave you are and that you&#39;re moving in with your Master so that you can serve him day and night. You&#39;re then going to get rid of all your possessions and return here to take your place as my permanent slave.” Like hell he would! Aron was insulted that James even thought he was so weak willed as to give in to a lifetime of servitude after just one night of amazing sex. Horrible rape, he corrected himself.<br />
<br />
“Can I go now?”<br />
<br />
“There is one last thing.” James whipped out his dick. Aron felt his entire being come alive with lust at its sight. “Suck it.” Aron dropped to his knees and began sucking it frantically, while his inner self screamed for his body to stop. The cock felt so good in his mouth, he wanted more. He shoved it even further back, bringing it into his throat.<br />
<br />
“Wow there, slave. I didn&#39;t even order you to deep throat it. You must really love sucking cock.” With huge shame, Aron realized that he could in fact pull back if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
“There. That&#39;s better. You see, I don&#39;t want you to swallow it this time. Slave, when I cum, you are to hold the cum firmly in your mouth and keep it there until you get home.” Hadn&#39;t Aron&#39;s mouth already been occupied by a cock so large that it had trouble fitting in his mouth, he would have been screaming and begging not to have to do this. But all he could do was to unwillingly blow this cock that was so perfect and wonderful for his mouth.<br />
<br />
James came. Thick ropes of cum filling Aron&#39;s entire mouth to the brim. His cheeks bulged and he had to struggle not to let any slip out from his lips. It was the most amazing thing he&#39;d ever tasted! He felt himself cuming as well, without even touching his dick. Filling his pants with even more jiz. The stain that bloomed was clearly visible. And still, James&#39;s cum was still flowing. Aron was at his limit at how much his mouth could hold, when James pulled out and shot the rest all over Aron&#39;s face and hair. There was so much! It drenched him.<br />
<br />
With the huge cock out of his mouth, Aron&#39;s cheeks stopped bulging so, but his mouth was still very full of the seed. Why did it taste so good. Even keeping himself from swallowing it was a torment. Half of him wanted to spit it out. The other half wanted to swallow every drop. Yet all he could do was keep it in place.<br />
<br />
“Good boy,” James said as cum dripped from his slave&#39;s face. “I have an additional order for you. You are not to wipe my cum off your face or hair. If anyone tries to talk to you on your way home, you must open your mouth and show them that you&#39;re full of cum. No go.”<br />
<br />
Aron scurried out without even getting a chance to put on shoes or socks. He walked out barefoot, dripping with fresh cum, mouth full of cum, covered in dry cum and with a sensitive penis rubbing against the rough fabric of his pants with every step. People on the street stared at his slutty appearance. The humiliation of it all was bringing him closer to another orgasm.<br />
<br />
If James was somehow able to make Aron do things by simply ordering it, which seemed to be the case, then it would mean that as soon as he got home, he&#39;d be forced to tell everyone what a gay slutt he was. He couldn&#39;t stand the idea. The humiliation. It made him want to cum. He didn&#39;t want to go home now, but he had no choice.<br />
<br />
Aron stepped onto the subway car at the nearest station to get home. He was sure everyone there had seen the semen on his face. If not, they certainty could smell it.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you have any shame?” a woman said. Aron found himself turning to face her and half the people in the compartment standing behind her. He parted his lips wide and gaped for the audience, revealing the pool of cum in his mouth. His tongue swimming in it. Gossamer threads of cum lingering between his lips. They all stared at him and the humiliation drove Aron over the edge again. They all watched as he moaned, still gaping at them, as his knees pressed together and his body shook. The patch of cum on the front of his pants expanded. It felt so good, Aron wanted to die.</p>
