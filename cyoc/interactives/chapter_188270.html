<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad was happy to see that Connor was looking well and had answers to all the questions he&#39;d apparently had about his sexuality for years. Hearing from Amy about her suspicions that Connor might not have been straight came as a massive surprise to him. He wasn&#39;t going to turn on his friend if Connor was gay or bi, as he knew that his mother was a bisexual werecat and there was nothing wrong with that orientation. The surprise was more that there seemed to be the potential for questions to be there. As Tad had long remembered hanging out with Connor and that when they&#39;d talked about things like &quot;girls&quot; and so on, Connor had never seemed uncomfortable or un-attracted to girls, and there was enough of a difference in specific details that Tad didn&#39;t think that Connor was just copying Tad&#39;s interests. Thus Tad had been pretty sure that Connor was straight and hearing that there might be some questions there was a surprise, and at first it also made Tad feel a bit guilty and nervous that he might have contributed to whatever issues Connor had had. Thus seeing Connor have some confidence and relief now came as a great relief to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in some ways... being bi could open up all sorts of opportunities for you,&quot; Tad offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the whole getting action from both sexes thing?&quot; Connor raised an eyebrow back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s part of it,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;and I&#39;ve found that things can be a bit forward here in ways that they weren&#39;t in Quantico. I mean... I met Amy on the street as she was walking to school... or to the bus stop, and she would later help me unpack some things in my room. It made for a good introduction, a first friend... and well, she left a note that was pretty obvious about sex... if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you jumped at the opportunity for a frisky girlfriend?&quot; Connor continued to look to Tad as they sat together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I did try to be polite and respectful, as my parents raised me,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;partially because some of these things also came a bit of a surprise to be too. But... I did hook up with Amy, and not just because she&#39;s beautiful... athletic... and all those sorts of physical things. But she&#39;s been smart and kind, and her family has been welcoming to my mom and me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make it sound like you found something fairly serious with her,&quot; Connor commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, and we make for a rather matching pair,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;My fursona is a solid black... like my dad... wolf. Amy&#39;s fursona is a sold white wolf. It&#39;d be nice if it becomes a proverbial happy ever after, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should be something to see,&quot; Connor commented as Connor returned playful punch that Tad had delivered earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe some night we can do that,&quot; Tad offered, &quot;you and Ryan come out into the woods in your fursonas... and Amy and I will meet you there in our fursonas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be something interesting,&quot; Connor nodded, &quot;though... I&#39;d think that Ryan and I have only just gotten started with all that sort of thing, so we aren&#39;t as far along as you and Amy are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded as he looked across the Connor&#39;s bedroom and to the windows letting in the morning sunlight. He could also tell that while Connor, himself, now carried a werewildcat&#39;s scent, his bed still had his normal human scent on it. That had to mean that Connor had ended up spending the night with Ryan. That had to make for a very good first day and private induction into were society for Connor, which in its way was a good thing so far as Tad was concerned. Though a lot of that also related to how forward and even encouraging the Ross family&#39;s reaction had been to Moon Lake&#39;s secrets was something that Tad felt would give those worried about &quot;the reveal&quot; that was being planned reason to be optimistic. In its own way, Connor&#39;s figuring out where his sexuality actually was and with things as confident as Connor seemed now was a good thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s understandable,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;I mean... you&#39;ve only been here a couple of days now. You&#39;ve only just become a were. There&#39;s a lot of things you&#39;re still learning... and with some of the ins and outs that go around Moon Lake, even I&#39;m still learning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, most of that has to do with the town&#39;s laws and quirks,&quot; Connor pointed out, &quot;from what you told me... you were born a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in my werewolf form...&quot; Tad chuckled, &quot;that I wouldn&#39;t attain until I turned fourteen, but yes. My mom is a werecat and my dad was a werewolf. Thus I was born a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded, &quot;and I get the sense that I&#39;ll get the formal welcome to Ryan&#39;s pride this evening. There will be the planning for it going on after lunch or something like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s understandable,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to get in the way of things that are official, be it with regard to you joining a pride or things between you and Ryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be the more unofficial things that right now are the concern,&quot; Connor commented, &quot;I mean... I know I&#39;m bi, but what would that mean for the other issues that relate to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like balancing the fact that you&#39;re starting a relationship with Ryan and still have some interest in women?&quot; Tad wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yeah,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;I mean... wouldn&#39;t that be taboo, or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say there is anything wrong with the desire,&quot; Tad answered and rested a hand on Connor&#39;s shoulder, &quot;and from what Ryan&#39;s told me on his dad&#39;s relationship with Ryan&#39;s mom... and what a lot of bi werecats and werewildcats may have... is that they could well have a rather open relationship. You would be with Ryan officially... but from time to time, if there is a woman you&#39;re interested in and she is willing... you could be with her to scratch that proverbial itch as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d sound an awful lot like cheating, though,&quot; Connor commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not cheating...&quot; Tad corrected, &quot;Though, it&#39;d also be something that you&#39;d want to talk with Ryan about first. Try to see on what he would want and to be honest with him. Particularly if you&#39;re trying to explain how things work. Especially in how things would go. Especially if they are to relate in how your desires are to operate. Cheating would be going behind Ryan&#39;s back, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you want to do... is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Connor nodded and then sighed, &quot;Though it seems odd... I know what my desires are and now don&#39;t know how to act on them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just a part of realizing some things and then having to respond to the consequences of those realizations,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;which is I said that if this becomes something where you&#39;d want a more open relationship... that you&#39;d date and be with Ryan, and then occasionally be with a woman on other nights... you&#39;d need to make sure that Ryan is okay with that before setting anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given that we&#39;re only just starting out... I hadn&#39;t really thought that far ahead on whether or not that&#39;s something I&#39;d actually want to do,&quot; Connor admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take your time,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;and if you get to that point and make that choice... be honest and open. I&#39;m pretty sure Ryan would respect that...&quot;</p>
