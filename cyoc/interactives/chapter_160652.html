<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Compared to recent weeks, the line today isn’t as long as before. There surely are old faces like Mrs. Hersham who had problems with her children growing up to what she didn’t expect. Her boy grew up to be an Ice Skater while her daughter became a car saleswoman. Then there’s Mr. Chinchinilla, a weird for someone with a benign problem about his co-workers. To be honest, his uncle shouldn’t be telling their stories to Nicky. But his uncle is a blabbermouth and he doesn’t care about Patient Confidentiality and all that bullshit.<br />
<br />
But among the line, there’s one Nicky couldn’t place a finger on. He’s probably new and judging by his twitching and anxious demeanor, this guy has serious problems. Nicky approached the man and got a better look at him. Short hair, one that can prick you when you lap your hand on his head. He’s got blue bright eyes, cute pinch-inducing cheeks which are flushed pink. He looked sad and he has probably seen better days. When Nicky called up to him to come to the room, he smiled meekly, showing the deep dimples in those cheeks.<br />
<br />
Nicky went by the room and lead the guy to the seat.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Sanchez, is this your second time coming here?” Bruce said.<br />
<br />
This guy, Sanchez, nodded and returned to his crestfallen look. <br />
<br />
“You still haven’t gotten over Mr. Bubbles?” <br />
<br />
Nicky snickered. Mr. Bubbles is a funny name.<br />
<br />
“Yes… I um- I don’t feel comfortable when there are other people in the room?”<br />
<br />
And by other people, he meant Nicky.<br />
<br />
“Oh, him? He’s my assistant for today. We need him for what we are going to do today since our last session hasn’t helped. You’ll get over your pet goldfish in no time.”<br />
<br />
Nicky couldn’t hold on to his laughter anymore. He let out a chuckle before his uncle rushed over to him and shut his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Did he just laugh?” Sanchez asked.<br />
<br />
“No, he has Ummm… He coughed. Isn’t that right Nicky?” Bruce kicked Nicky by the heals, which hurt a lot.<br />
<br />
“Yes. So, the thing?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes. The thing. Mr. Sanchez, I would like you to relax on your seat, close your eyes and breathe. Slowly.” Sanchez did what was instructed to him. As he was doing this, Bruce circled back to his desk and grabbed a ring. He wore it on his left, and in an unexplainable manner, it glowed. It blinked a momentary flash of light that coursed throughout Bruce’s body. “Continue breathing. Slowly. Slowly… Feel yourself drifting between the boundaries of sleep and consciousness. Feel the ebb of the air coursing through your skin. The tiny pricks of the sunlight from the windows. Follow the sound of my voice with your mind and breath. Deeper this time.”<br />
<br />
Bruce walked nearer to the breathing Sanchez and laid his hands on his shoulders. Then suddenly, the impossible happened. It was no trick of the light as every second Nicky blinked, what came back from his sight is all the same. Bruce’s hands are sinking on Sanchez’s body. It’s slow and a tight fit but Bruce kept going and going until his arms are elbow-deep inside of Sanchez.<br />
<br />
“Don’t open your eyes. Breath slowly. Yes… Yes… That’s right. You’re doing it.”<br />
<br />
Bruce pushed deeper. When his shoulders are now at the point of contact, he used his remaining forelimb to do a headstand above Sanchez’s torso. And in one fell swoop, half his body fell in. Sanchez was oblivious as this was happening and for some reason, he was smiling while this is happening. Bruce’s head is nowhere to be seen and only his legs are visible. And those too are wriggling deeper like a scuba diver diving into the depths. <br />
<br />
When the last of Bruce’s feet are gone, an envelope of green light covered Sanchez’s skin. He wasn’t relaxed like before, rather, the smile he had turned into a wide-open grin. The dimples are visible in his cheeks and when he stood up, something inside him screamed of Bruce. The way he carried his arms confidently, the way his legs stood an inch apart, or how his eyes flashed with Bruce’s signature all over it. Nicky knew. He knew that this wasn’t the Sanchez he has seen briefly before. <br />
<br />
This guy is Bruce.<br />
<br />
“Bruce?” Nicky asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, kid. It’s me. It’s nice to know that you already know who I am. God! It feels good to be young again.” Bruce, now Sanchez, stood from his seat and looked at himself in the long mirror. He spun around, clasping his broadening arms and even did a series of flexes. He wasn’t buff to say, but he wasn’t thin either. There’s a good amount of muscle and fat hidden underneath those clothes and skin. “So what do you think eh?”<br />
<br />
“Fucked. Up.” That’s what Nicky could only say.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I thought too when my dad possessed my best friend’s body. Oh, the days when he used Martin to go to the beach was really weird.” <br />
<br />
“Possessed, that’s what you call it? Like a ghost?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. These rings are called possession rings. These ten rings are made of Jade from China. Your great grandfather fought everyone until the only people that know the existence of these things are us. Well, two of us.” <br />
<br />
“That’s so fucking cool. Let me try!”<br />
<br />
“I know you would say that. But first, let me teach you the basics as my father did.”<br />
<br />
Bruce grabbed one of the rings and placed it snuggly on Nicky’s left. “Always wear it on the left, not right. But left. Place it tight but not too tight. There.” From the moment of contact, Nicky could feel the surge of energy electrifying him from the inside. He couldn’t place it but it’s no mere energy you can get from drinking too much coffee. It’s something more. Something that surpasses mortal understanding. You can’t understand it but you can only feel. <br />
<br />
The energy ebbed away which left Nicky with a desire to dominate. The desire to possess.<br />
<br />
“Possessing someone wearing clothes is pretty hard for a beginner,” Bruce said. “So to make things easier, we need to remove these hurdles.” Bruce undressed his tight polo and nipped the rest of his pants on the ground. Then he pulled his tight boxers and undressed those too - leaving him naked right in front of his nephew.<br />
<br />
Bruce grabbed Nicky’s hand and let him touch his bare chest. Nicky felt his warmth, the smoothness of his skin, the rise and fall of his lungs. By touch, he could hear the thump of his heartbeat, like drums underneath the soil. “To truly possess someone, first you need to know. Touch, inspect, learn. I’ll teach you as my father did.”<br />
<br />
Nicky was apprehensive at first but Bruce merely smiled and pulled him closer. “Don’t be shy.”<br />
<br />
“I am not,” Well, he is. Bruce could see it as clear as day. The boy is flushed red. It’s not Nicky’s fault he hasn’t been in this kind of situation before. Sure he has seen his step-brother naked before, maybe even saw them fuck hookers at the end of the street. But not this. But still, it’s his uncle in there. In that body. And he’s allowing him, letting him touch all he wants. A touch wouldn’t hurt after all.<br />
<br />
Nicky started at the behind, far from his uncle’s gaze. There are faint pockmarks and freckles here in there - stretching from the nape of his neck to his ass. And speaking of ass, it’s decent. Not quite bubbly but plump nonetheless. Nicky gave it a squeeze and small slap that wouldn’t hurt his uncle. Bruce, on the other hand, could merely laugh at this. <br />
<br />
Next, Nicky circled upfront and came face to face with his smiling uncle. He seemed to be enjoying this. Well, who wouldn’t? Nicky placed his head closer and took a small whiff of his chest. He smelled pure vanilla and the scent of baby powder. Nicky came even closer and traced the slight bumps where the abdominal muscles should be. He scoured them for the muscles underneath and the strength they contained. Nicky then raised the body’s arms with a bit of effort. These guys are heavy despite their appearance. Nicky clasped the muscles between his thumb and four fingers and gave them a good squeeze. <br />
<br />
And lastly, the dick. Shaven yet cut. The shaft’s white and the tip is nearly pink. It’s an upgrade compared to Nicky’s 4-inch wiener. Nicky gave them a poke and that was enough to bring life on the member. The balls, spotless of hair, enlarged. The flaccid shaft rose meekly, giving the entire structure a bit of length. By his estimate, it’s somewhere 6 to 8 inches. Surprisingly adequate for a man about his age.<br />
<br />
“How old is he?” Nicky asked.<br />
<br />
“About 22 maybe?” Bruce replied. “So you got to know him now?”<br />
<br />
Nicky nodded.<br />
<br />
“Now we do the best part, the possession. Now get undressed while I prep myself on the floor.”<br />
<br />
Nicky stopped in his tracks. Did he hear that right? Undress? He gave his uncle a lengthy stare which ended with a chuckle from Bruce.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t I tell you the clothes are a hurdle? That means, it includes your clothes. Now, don’t be sappy and just do it. Or… do you want me to help you?”<br />
<br />
“N- No! I’ll do it myself.”<br />
<br />
Nicky undressed his baggy clothes and displayed his entire nude figure to his uncle. Who on the other hand, was a bit bothered at the thing between his nephew’s legs. “You certainly got your father’s dick.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve seen my father naked?” Nicky said, surprised. <br />
<br />
“Sure did. Possessed him multiple times too. I don’t know what your mother saw in that man. Anyway, let’s do it. While you possess Sanchez, I’ll slowly slide out to give you space. He won’t fight back, I’ll make sure of that. So, are you ready?”<br />
<br />
Nicky nodded. <br />
<br />
Bruce laid on the ground, his arms tucked at his sides and his legs closed. His dick is standing weakly and slowly lying down as well. As for Nicky, he stood over his uncle and crouched down. He lowered his chest until he has planked on top of the other’s body. He could feel his skin on his and the slight poke of his dick on his own. It’s embarrassing so to say, and Nicky is starting to get red once more.<br />
<br />
Bruce closed his eyes and focused on his whole being separating from Sanchez, starting from the feet. As Bruce left, Nicky entered. He slipped right in without discomfort nor difficulties. The sensation of Nicky’s feet was suddenly gone and in a moment, it returns - bigger and facing the other direction. The same thing happened with his legs and for his crotch. It was a fucked up scenario Nicky got himself into. One half of his body is facing the floor and the other is facing the ceiling. Amongst it all, he is face to face with the body he’ll soon overtake. Nicky’s chest slid in, disappearing in the fleshy embrace of the other body. Then his arms and soon his neck. And lastly, the head. The last thing Nicky saw before descending in the darkness is the signature smile of his uncle who briefly said, “Good Luck”<br />
<br />
It was dark momentarily. Darkness never lasts. There will always be in the light.<br />
<br />
Nicky sprung awake on the floor. He is naked, cold and the visage of his smiling uncle was in front of him. He quickly grabbed Sanchez’s clothes on the floor and dressed in his clothes. Wearing his slightly wet underwear was disgusting but seeing that there are no other undergarments in the room, he was forced to wear this one instead of none.<br />
<br />
“So boy, tell me. How does it feel to be in someone else’s body.”<br />
<br />
It’s strange of course. It’s Nicky’s first time after all. He felt bigger and his sensations are more numerous and spread out. The color of the room certainly changed. The colors are a bit muted but the greens are more vibrant than before. When he tried to speak out a voice, his throat vibrated a different frequency. It’s broader and vocalized deeper in his chords. Nicky could even feel the difference of how his tongue rested on his mouth. His saliva tasted like cake - vanilla. He stood higher, felt stronger and most of all, sad.<br />
<br />
“Sad?” Bruce asked. “Of course you feel sad, that’s what I felt when I possessed his body. And that’s what he felt before we possessed his body. You’ll feel what he felt before but it won’t last long. Go out there, experience life in his body. Change what you currently feel.”<br />
<br />
Bruce stood from where he was sitting and picked Nicky’s clothes that are littered on the floor. “I’ll take care of your clothes for now and I’ll notify your step-mom that you’ll be staying at my place for a while. As for you,” Bruce opened his file drawer and grabbed a copy of Sanchez’ file. “His whole name is James Sanchez and he lives by 43 Oak Drive. Whoa, this guy’s fat on the bucks. Let me see that guy’s wallet.”<br />
<br />
Bruce grabbed the wallet on Nicky’s pockets, opened it and grabbed a couple of dollars. “Here’s for today’s session and here’s a tip. Leaving you with uh… 120$ That good for you?”<br />
<br />
Nicky couldn’t believe it. 120$! He hasn’t owned money that large before. He thanked his uncle and bid him goodbye. But before leaving, his uncle gave one brief talk.<br />
<br />
“Be careful out there, Nicky. It’s best to keep that ring a secret between you and me. You hear me?”<br />
<br />
Nicky nodded.<br />
<br />
“Before you leave, rate my office five stars on Boogle Maps! Leave a great review!”</p>
<hr/><h3>
And with that, Nicky is gone. But where did he go?</h3>
