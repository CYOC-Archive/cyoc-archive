<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Nate and Kenya didn’t waste time when they got back to her house. After a brief trip to the little wolf’s room, Nate emerged from the bathroom completely naked. And to his delight, Kenya was also undressed and had already assumed her fursona. <br />
<br />
Seeing his panthress lying on satin sheets with her legs seductively crossed made him rocket almost burst from its furry home. Nate shifted as he walked to the bed. He crawls up to Kenya, a large grin on his face. <br />
<br />
“So…”<br />
<br />
“So…” Kenya echoed. <br />
<br />
“Dinner went well.” Nate sniffed the air, catching his partner’s arousal. He licked his lips, and then Kenya’s. She purred, and reached a paw down to find Nate’s head. There she started teasing his ears, which he found to be surprisingly stimulating. <br />
<br />
“I agree. But can we save that talk for later? I’d rather do something about the alternate topics on my mind.” she moaned as Nate’s tongue slid in and out. Kenya had been eaten out before, usually by other felines. The difference in texture, of their tongues, made Nate’s lapping much more enjoyable. <br />
<br />
“Fine by me…” Nate only paused for a second to respond before he dove back into Kenya’s black slit. Satisfied with the tastes lingering in my mouth, he edged himself forward until his rocket was touching Kenya’s outer lip. <br />
<br />
He howled as he pushed himself inside, Kenya’s walls gripping tight to his penis. Almost sucking him in. Once the base of his cock hit something solid, Nate stopped. He looked down at the panthress beneath him. The two, very carefully since they were still “attached” rolled onto their side. Kenya then swung her leg over Nate, so she could turn around. <br />
<br />
Lying back to back, Nate started moving his hips forward and backward.  Kenya’s paw played with her clit as Nate fucked her. He brought one of his own paws around her to grasp her massive breasts. She rewarded him with a mew of pleasure. Nate’s fucking for rougher as his orgasm built. Every few seconds, Kenya’s tail lashed against his nose, causing Nate to sneeze. He released small spurts of cum while he sneezed. <br />
<br />
“I…” Nate felt his body tension, and knew it was only a matter of second until he lost it. His knot was swollen, and Kenya’s warm folds held tight to his cock. Thick streams of cum were spent into her pussy, causing Nate to howl. Kenya did something like a purr and a roar. <br />
<br />
The two collapsed, the bed wet with sweat and cum. Nate’s knot was still engorged, so until it deflated he attentively licked some of the spunk from Kenya’s body. <br />
<br />
<br />
But there was a sudden buzzing from one of their phones that effectively killed the mood. With a lot of difficulty, Kenya inched towards the edge of the bed to see if it was her phone, all the while Nate’s hard rocket still inside her. And ever slight movement, or brush nearly caused Nate to cum right there. <br />
<br />
“Oh damn.” she whispered, almost to quiet for even Nate to hear her. <br />
<br />
“Anything wrong?” Nate asked.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile… <br />
<br />
Eric and Spencer had collapsed against Spencer’s bed after they reached their own orgasms. The two lay in each other’s arms, basking in the afterglow. Eric continued to stroke the fur on the back of Spencer’s head. The rhythmic purring was like having a vibrator on his lap (not that Eric knew what a vibrator felt like). Though his cell phone had shifted to some awkward positions before and then started to buzz. <br />
<br />
“I just had a thought.” he said, as his fingers dos deeper and deeper into Spencer’s coat. <br />
<br />
“Me too, but you go first.” she said. <br />
<br />
“Thanks. I asked Ben earlier what others kinds of feline were there are around town. He said there were a couple of compatible weretigers, but few free, single female leopards, jaguars or panthers. The rest are either too young, too old, or the wrong orientation.” <br />
<br />
“Mmm, not that I mind or anything, but no lions?“ Spencer wondered aloud. She didn’t care for lions and their hierarchies. Nor the manes on the males. They got in the way, and were more frustrating to deal with than her own hair. <br />
<br />
“Well I was never considering them. From what Ben’s told me they have issues living so far north because they don’t get the seasonal coats other weres do. Lion, cheetah, and even leopards/panthers typically live in warm climates.”<br />
<br />
Spencer nodded, never really thought about the drastic shifts in weather, and how they affected certain weres. Wolves were one of the most versatile species since they were native to this part of the world, and made their homes in area that had cold winters and warm summers. Their fur changed accordingly. But species who were typically found in places like Africa, where the only way to see snow was on a TV, must have a hard time adjusting. <br />
<br />
““If he’s following that train of thought, I’d think Eric would choose a wolf or tiger. Or maybe…” Spencer’s mind drifted to that bizarre dream about her and Eric as that white cat. <br />
<br />
“What are you grinning about?” Eric asked, noticing Spencer’s wide smile. <br />
<br />
“Oh, nothing. Just had a pleasant thought.” she lied quickly. In truth it was only a half lie. The idea that came into her head was very pleasant. <br />
<br />
“So, we’ve obvious got the rest of the night to do whatever we want. What do you want to do?” Eric asked, sitting up. As Spencer was about to suggest something they both were startled by Eric’s stomach growling.<br />
<br />
“Wow, did you skip dinner? That’s the whole point of this holiday. To overeat and watch football” Spencer joked. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think I’m hungry for food.” Eric said coyly. <br />
<br />
“Someone’s being adventurous. What’s brought this on?”<br />
<br />
“Must be something else I ate.” Eric leaned forward to kiss Spencer’s nose. <br />
<br />
“I can only imagine how good actual sex is,” Eric thought excited at the thought of finally losing his virginity. And he didn’t want anyone but Spencer to take it. He wondered how long he should wait to become a were. <br />
<br />
If Kenya did agree, should it be right away? Or should he wait until things quiet down? Jeremy and his father are out of the picture, what else could happen?</p>
