<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Class... well, it was not how you expected it to go, to say the least. When you first entered the room, things seemed normal enough. Pretty casual, no one gave a care for looks given it was 9am. Quite a few people were sleeping even. <br />
<br />
Only a few people even acknowledged you entering the room, that is until they saw that your tits were on full display. Surprisingly those were more of the focus than your fox parts. The 3 girls who took notice of you, approached you and sat in the row infront of you and your boyfriend. You just ignored them and laid down your head on his lap hoping he would pet you while you were waiting for class to start. Everything was going fine until one of the new girls who just walked into the room came up and sat down next to your boyfriend.<br />
<br />
She was fairly pretty you guessed, bit nothing like yourself, so you didn&#39;t take her as much of a threat and continued laying down gently getting stroked on the back of your head. The mild noise of the room was enough to drown out your purring, so you just let it happen. &quot;Aww, she is just like my pet cat.&quot; Said the girl to your boyfriend. &quot;Can I pet her too?&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn and look up at this girl. She seemed normal enough, kind of familiar even, but you couldn&#39;t remember who she was. Your boyfriend nodded in agreement, which meant to you that if he was fine with her, then you could trust her too. Gently a new set of fingers began stroking your head, as your boyfriend moved down to the base of your tail. <br />
<br />
Yes, this is such a good feeling. Being pet and scratched in 2 places at once was so relaxing and felt really good. That was until this girl began to pet your ears. You invoulentarrily begin to pant and moan which of course attracks the attention of several others. Heads turned to look at you. The girl had pulled her hand away and looked slightly shocked at you. It was too late though, the embarrassment was setting in, which triggered your libido to kick into full gear. You pulled in your tail to try and cover yourself from view. &quot;Did she just...&quot; the girl says in disbelief. <br />
<br />
It was your boyfriend who spoke up though. &quot;Yeah my bad, I forgot to warn you not to touch her ears, they are extremely sensitive.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... aren&#39;t they like, just a headband though? Why would they cause her to moan like that?&quot; Whispered the girl, after realizing that a few people were looking right at us. Boyfriend was here to bail me out a bit though. &quot;Seriously this guy is amazing&quot;, I thought, feeling proud to be his girlfriend. &quot;Shh... they are very real, so just be careful. We can talk more about this after class back at our appartment, ok um..&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Amanda, and thats fine with me. I am even more curious about her tail now too.&quot; Amanda nodded and left it at that. But she did continue to pet you again, being more careful of your ears this time. Unfortunately this was how you would spend the rest of the entire lecture. As a lap pet for your boyfriend and this girl named Amanda. You had completely missed out on the entire class, which kind of sucked, but it just felt too good to stop. When it was over, the 3 girls in front of you all turned to face the 3 of you with displeased looks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, making your girlfriend moan in class, while she goes around dressed like a slut, and have her act like she is some kind of pet? Really, I should just report you both for sexual harassment.&quot; Said the center girl. &quot;Oh, and not only that, but you both spent the entire lesson making her purr like she is some kind of cat too.&quot; Added on one of the side girls.<br />
<br />
Hearing that, you sat up and couldn&#39;t help yourself as you began to growl at them, which actually ended up startling everyone, including your boyfriend, who quickly put a hand on your shoulder attempting to calm you down. &quot;Leave them, they are not worth getting into a fight with iver baseless threats, especially Jane&quot; he whispered in such a quiet voice only you with your improved hearing could make out. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t dare to act upon those threats herself as she knows it would be even worse for her if she tried to harm you. She is just a jealous ex of mine who I dumped a while back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hearing that, you didn&#39;t stop growling but toned down the intensity a bit. However Amanda was the one who stepped forward. &quot;Let&#39;s see, Jane Woods. 21 years years old. Majoring in BioChem. Junior. Ooh, dating freshman Tony Hoster, and if what I hear is correct, you&#39;re fucking him too right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jane turned to face Amanda. &quot;So what if I am? And who the hell are you why do you even care? This is between us and them, so stay out of it bitch.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amanda didn&#39;t even show any reaction and just kept talking. &quot;That is actually very interesting that you would so willingly admit to doing it so readily. I mean, what would happen if one of the members of public saftey were to find out that Tony only just last month turned 17, and yet his girlfriend, who is 21 admited to fucking him. That&#39;s statutory rape if you didn&#39;t know, which is illegal. Would be a shame if that happened since Tony seemes to like you too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jane&#39;s face paled and her 2 friends who seemed to not know this part about Jane quickly left the room. &quot;A-Alright. I get it. S-sorry to bother you all.&quot; Studdered Jane as she quickly followed after her &quot;friends&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn. That was so cool!&quot; you say turning to look at Amanda. &quot;How did you know all of that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I made it all up&quot; Amanda said casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they believe you, and acted like it was true...&quot; pointed out your boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Amanda smiled mischievously. &quot;Thats a trade secret. Anyways, I assume you both are heading home now or do you have more classes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope we have the same classes, and this was our only one today. Want to ride along with us?&quot; Offered your boyfriend, you nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Lead the way.&quot;</p>
