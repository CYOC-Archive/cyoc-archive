<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan was super nervous as he made excuses to leave practice early. Picking up Eric from school, his little brother was chipper and good-natured, and Ethan was cringing internally the whole ride home as he listened to Eric talk about his day. Not only because of what he HAD to get Eric to do, but also because he was super conscious of his sensitive crotch, which was rock hard the entire way, like it was telling him to embrace his condition.<br />
<br />
After they got home and put away their school things, Ethan joined Eric in his room and sat down with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said, still feeling very anxious, &quot;I need to ask you a serious question about our swap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Eric&#39;s attention was sincere, his expression innocent.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve learned something new about the ring. It seems if you don&#39;t REALLY want a swap to happen, it won&#39;t, no matter how hard you try.&quot; Ethan fixed his brother with an intense look. &quot;Be honest with me, I need to know. Do- ... do you think of my cock like it&#39;s yours? Like it belongs to you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; Eric blushed deep red, stammering out his answer, and he nodded slowly, but then he blurted the rest out, being as truthful as his brother asked. &quot;I love it so much! I don&#39;t want to be selfish, but- ... but it feels perfect to me!&quot; Then there was a pause as Eric put the pieces together in his head, figuring out why Ethan was asking this question and his eyes widened. &quot;Did you try to swap us back, but it didn&#39;t work because ... you really like having my cock too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan nodded breathlessly, his own face bright red, agreeing to the shameful secret that Eric had just smartly intuited. Eric didn&#39;t laugh or make fun though, he just frowned, and held out his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have the ring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; The older brother handed it to him. &quot;Um ... it&#39;s not going to work though, and I&#39;m afraid-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, Ethan. Let me try.&quot; Eric took the ring and slipped it on. &quot;I&#39;m already wearing your boxers, so I don&#39;t need to change into anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but I don&#39;t- ... ahhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
To Ethan&#39;s utter shock, he felt flesh push out of his groin, his dick swelling and thickening as it returned to full size.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?!&quot; He gasped. &quot;I thought- ... how did you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s simple.&quot; Eric shrugged. &quot;I want to have a big cock SO badly, but you&#39;re my brother, and I want you to be happy even more! I can ALWAYS swap us if you need me to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric!&quot; Overwhelmed with relief, Ethan hugged his little brother, wrapping his arms around Eric&#39;s slim boyish shoulders. Eric hugged him back, just as tightly. &quot;I love you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too.&quot; Eric let go of him, and with a shy look he bit his lip. &quot;Can I ask a favour now though? Well two things, if you&#39;re okay with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for my little brother.&quot; Ethan nodded firmly, gripping Eric&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Just name it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, um, can I hold onto the ring? That way you can&#39;t get stuck. I can promise I&#39;ll be careful with it, but I want to make sure you&#39;re safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a big question, but Ethan knew his brother. He wasn&#39;t trying to be clever. Eric&#39;s concern was genuine, and he was responsible for his age. He really was just trying to help. <br />
<br />
Ethan reasoned that he could just dispose of the ring altogether and be done with the swapping and the risks, but ... he had seen how much Eric had enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Maybe letting him hold onto the ring was a better compromise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; He agreed, and squeezed Eric&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You can be in charge. Keep it secure, for now. What was the other thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, um,&quot; Eric hesitated, super bashful. &quot;Can- ... can we share our cocks, for real? I mean, like ... yours is mine, and mine is yours too. So whenever we swap, it&#39;s always true, no matter what! They&#39;re just OURS, period.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s heart raced. Shared ownership of two cocks! Could he do that? If it was anyone else, he&#39;d probably just flat refuse but ... this was Eric! There was nobody in the world he trusted more. Still ... he&#39;d be accepting Eric&#39;s control over his teenage junk, and also agreeing that Eric&#39;s tiny dick was his own too. That was a big ask! BUT ... his little brother had just pulled his ass out of a metaphorical fire, and Ethan felt indebted to him. The kid was a lifesaver and had Ethan&#39;s best interests at heart.<br />
<br />
Eric just happened to also love having a really large cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Ethan repeated.<br />
<br />
In his head, he couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d just agreed, but he was -- for some reason -- excited by giving over power to his brother. Though, he knew he could have been stuck with a little dick, so agreeing to share seemed like a small price in comparison to that.<br />
<br />
Eric was staring at him a little dumbfounded, clearly not expecting both things to be accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I DID say anything.&quot; Ethan went on. He grinned weakly and patted his groin. &quot;All of this is yours now too, little bro. Shared cocks, for as long as you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
In Eric&#39;s mind, he had been scared that he would have to stop his new attachment to being a hung 11 year old in order to help Ethan, but instead, he had received something better! Ethan&#39;s cock was now &#39;his&#39;, but legitimately! No more temporary ownership, he could have it whenever he pleased.<br />
<br />
Sharing his own little dick didn&#39;t seem like it mattered all that much, because he had what he wanted.<br />
<br />
He was already thinking about how glad he was he could keep enjoying his secret selfsucking addiction, and when he might get another chance to practice it, and also do stuff like show off his size in public.<br />
<br />
There was no reason to mention those hidden benefits now though. They were private thoughts, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Ethan.&quot; He said softly. &quot;You&#39;re the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
The rest of the afternoon, the two of them hung out, and then Ethan ordered some takeout in the evening. Then they both did their homework and Ethan worked on a school project too. Finally, as it began to reach sleep time before the following school day, he made a little time to feel like the &#39;teenage stud&#39; that girls like Haylee apparently thought he was.<br />
<br />
Ethan needed some time to get back in touch with his &#39;normal&#39; self.<br />
<br />
Relaxing on his bed, he pulled out his cock and began to slowly stroke it, stretching it to full size as it hardened. He wanted to appreciate having it back, how lucky he was to have a dick like this to begin with. Ethan was never that conscious of his size, but the more he thought about it, the more obvious it was. When he was going through puberty, the other boys around his age had always seemed to lag behind in the downstairs department. A lot of the stupid teasing and joking that came from the lockers through that time had a new meaning now, and the adolescent awkwardness of their comments were actually flattering. He felt good about it in retrospect, and so relieved that he managed to fix it.<br />
<br />
Thinking back to the events of the afternoon, he began to play with his balls and squeeze the shaft, a little precum dribbling from the tip. Haylee&#39;s boobs were on his mind, and he imagined sliding his entire length in between them. The thought of the soft pillowy feel of them gliding around his engorged thick cock was enthralling, and Ethan lost himself in the fantasy of slow fucking them, seeing the swollen head of his penis push out from between them into the air. Jerking himself faster, the pressure began to build, and he was thinking of licking her breasts, sucking the nipples, thrusting his dick along through the super-smooth skin, and, just as he was tensing up, ready to-<br />
<br />
With an inward sensation, his genitals shrank rapidly, vanishing down to a reduced youthful state.<br />
<br />
With a shocked gasp, Ethan came, his rapidly tugging hand finishing the job. The fantasy had morphed, and his short super-sensitive cock was buried between her tits, completely hidden in a sea of feminine cleavage. His face was burning hot as a few little clear spurts shot out of his juvenile erection, and he relived the humiliation of the moment from the supply closet, Haylee&#39;s soft giggles replaying in his head.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Ethan calmed from his orgasm, his fingers cradling his little soft smooth balls, tickling them like marbles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the swapping is up to Eric, so I can&#39;t choose the timing.&quot; He thought to himself, the shame of how good it felt to cum this way lingering with the afterglow. &quot;Right now, he&#39;s the big boy, and right now ... this IS my cock.&quot;</p>
