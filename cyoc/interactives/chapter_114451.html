<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad splashed through the shallows, trying to spot Charlie out in the river.  His friend had been swimming out among the spawning salmon for a while now, and while he knew the fish were not dangerous, Brad wished he would come in.  Speaking of the fish, he scowled as a couple slipped around his legs.  There were so many of the damned things!  The troop should come out here and do some fishing - they would eat good.<br />
<br />
Puck flitted near the human, staying just behind the boy so he would not be spotted.  What to do with this one?  He cast about for ideas, and sensed the solution further down the river bank.  There were Fae all through the woods, and they responded to his call enthusiastically.  In the meantime, he could get this boy prepared.<br />
<br />
Brad felt a flush of sudden heat, not unpleasant, but odd in the otherwise cool night.  It was followed by an equally sudden clenching in his belly, and he shit himself so suddenly that it was over almost before he realized what had happened.  &quot;Fuck!&quot;  Those canned beans and hamburgers must not have been cooked properly on the campfire.  Mortified, he pulled his skivvies off and started to wash them out in the river.  Now he was glad Charlie was taking his time.  he did not want to be caught standing here naked and have to explain what had happened.  <br />
<br />
One of the fish leaped out of the water and skittered over his hands, causing Brad to yelp and stumble back.  He&#39;d dropped the soiled underwear, and search frantically in the dark, fast-moving water to spot them.  No luck.  &quot;Fucking fish!&quot;  He&#39;d have to go commando, which wasn&#39;t a big deal.  Except that he&#39;d have to either get dressed before Charlie came back or confess.  In either case, he needed to clean himself up.  He moved deeper into the water and used his fingers and the warm, rushing water to wash away the shit.  <br />
<br />
Puck watched the human move further into the river, and landed on the rocks just behind him.  This gave him a good view of the boy&#39;s backside.  It only took a little concentration to bring a light covering of hair sprouting across the human&#39;s back, and the growth thickened rapidly as it spread out over his shoulders and down his rump.  The boy also started to bulk up, his already hefty frame thickening and getting taller.<br />
<br />
Brad finished cleaning himself up. but was puzzled by what his fingers were reporting.  His normally-smooth skin felt hairy.  Very hairy.  In fact, as he ran his hands up his backside the hair seemed to thicken into a heavy mat that was almost like wet fur.  &quot;What the fuck?&quot;  Had he had some freaky sudden spurt of puberty?  As he kept exploring, he realized that he had developed a serious belly.  How had that happened?  And as he stared at the growing expanse of gut, it darkened even more as hair appeared.  Brad was dumbstruck, watching  with his mouth hanging open as his dark skin vanished under coarse brown fur that spread upwards.  It wasn&#39;t until he saw it appearing on his arms that fear broke through and got him moving.  He lurched for shore, aware that he had way more mass than he&#39;d had just a few minutes ago.  Heavy and awkward, he only made a few more steps before he stumbled and fell forward into the shallows with a splash.  <br />
<br />
Puck giggled as he watched the former human struggling to stand up.  Though his head and face were still mostly recognizable, the rest of him was rapidly transforming into a massive grizzly bear.  The fairy was intentionally keeping the boy&#39;s head human, at least until the second part of his plan appeared.  And right on cue, he saw a massive dark shape lumber out of the woods, surrounded by glowing fae.<br />
<br />
Confused and terrified, Brad stopped and shook himself, trying to calm down.  He was hallucinating, or having some kind of weird daydream, right?  An acrid odor filled his nostrils, unfamiliar and yet somehow linked to him.  He struggled to stand, and finally lurched up on his legs.  Fuck!  He felt like he weighed a thousand pounds!  Then he caught sight of massive, claw-tipped paws on the ends of furred, thick forelegs that should have been his hands and arms.  No way!  He looked like a fucking....  A thundering roar came from behind, and Brad spun around and screamed.  The biggest, meanest-looking bear he had ever even seen pictures of was standing there on the edge of the river, sniffing in his direction.<br />
<br />
The swarm of fae gathered on the rock beside Puck to enjoy the show.  Almost totally a beast except for his head, the human screamed again as the huge grizzly they had brought here began moving towards him.  There was no anger or malice in the grizzly&#39;s actions - it was interested in the human&#39;s scent, and for good reason.  This was prime mating time and the human was being tailor-made into this bear&#39;s perfect mate.</p>
