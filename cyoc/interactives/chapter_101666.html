<br />
Martha and Eric returned home just in time to help William and Nate prepare dinner. With so much of the kitchen taken up in preparation for Thanksgiving, the family decided to eat in the living room. Nate and Eric sat crossed legged on the ground, while Martha and William sat on the couch. <br />
<br />
“So, do you have any plans tonight Nate?” William asked knowingly. Yesterday Nate hadn’t sped out the door after dinner. And he didn’t come downstairs the next morning smelling like sex, or his girlfriend (as William assumed her to be based on his talk with Nate). <br />
<br />
“If it’s okay, I’m meeting Kenya at her place.” Nate said. William and Martha both nodded their heads, to Nate’s relief. He really wanted to go over and talk to her. <br />
<br />
“So that’s her name. What’s she like?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
“Um, she’s nice.” Nate said.<br />
<br />
“And here I wondered why you always sucked English. That’s the best adjective you could come up with?” Eric snickers. <br />
<br />
Nate chewed his lip to keep from saying something snide to his brother in front of his parents. He shoved a large glob of pasta into his mouth to further keep him silent. William took the opportunity to change the subject.<br />
<br />
“How are things at work honey?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Good. Kids are excited for the holiday season. And Jeremy seems to be doing a bit better” Martha said.<br />
<br />
“The boy whose father died back in June?” <br />
<br />
“Yes. He’s not isolating himself so much. Still doesn’t really talk to anyone, but one step at a time.” she said. <br />
<br />
“Sounds like Eric.” Nate grumbled. Martha shot him a look, and Nate sulked where he was sitting. Eric didn’t hear the comment, he was too busy caught up in his own thoughts. As he was so often these days. <br />
<br />
“Who’s planning on coming Thursday? I was thinking I’d set up the tables tomorrow afternoon in advance.”<br />
<br />
“Us, Kenya, the Twists plus Francis’ brother, and then the Lawsons are joining us for dessert. So we’ll need ” Martha said with a sly wink to William. They both knew that very little dessert would actually be served. Of course that was only if their children broke off into separate groups like the last time they three families got together for a big meal. <br />
<br />
“You’re bringing your girlfriend?” Eric said surprised, turning to his brother with a strand of spaghetti hanging out of his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Is that a problem?<br />
<br />
“No. It’s just the first time you’ve ever brought a girl home.” Eric said. Nate wanted to say something back, but Eric was right. He’d never brought anyone home to meet his family before. It was a big step, and he’d only known Kenya for a few weeks. <br />
<br />
“No Alex?” Eric asked, changing the subject. He and Ben rarely were apart, even for meals. Eric had expected his mother to fire off Alex’s name with the others. <br />
<br />
“He’s going to come over for dessert too I believe. His family will be spending their afternoon with Shelley’s family.” Martha said, repeating what Samantha told her earlier. <br />
<br />
“And the Lawsons are spending it with their family? They do have some up here don’t they?” William asked.<br />
<br />
“From what Maggie told me, it’ll just be them, her sister and brother-in-law, her parents, and possibly Jonathan’s parents. Apparently Evan’s father prefers solitude, despite being a werewolf.” <br />
<br />
“What’s that suppose to mean?” Nate asked, unsure if he should be offended or not.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t mean anything by that Nate. But werewolves are typically very social weres. It’s unusual to find one like Evan’s father who doesn’t like the company of others, let alone fellow werewolves.” Martha explained. <br />
<br />
“Huh, I guess that’s true. Must be why Ben and Alex spend so much time together. I never realized how serious the whole ‘mated pair’ thing was.” Nate remarked. He wondered if it was possible to have something like that with Kenya, even if she wasn’t a werewolf. Or did leopards have their own version of that? <br />
<br />
In any case, it would certainly make things easier for Nate if he did find his “mate” in Kenya. All these weird dreams about some other panther were really messing with him. He was fairly certain it wasn’t Spencer now, he’d spent most of the afternoon thinking about it, And while she was attractive, funny, and very appealing to Nate, he didn’t think he was in love with her. But then he wasn’t 100% positive he was in love with Kenya. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Do you think we should talk to Nate again? He seemed awfully defensive at dinner.” Martha said while she and William were washing dishes. Eric had gone to bed, while Nate went out to meet Kenya. It wasn’t a school night, but was still expected to return home before eleven. <br />
<br />
“I think we should wait until after Thursday to do anything drastic. But if you want to talk to him about Kenya, be my guest.” William shrugged. As far as he was concerned, Nate was just having some last minutes nerses about everything. <br />
<br />
“Speaking of nerves…” Martha said, removing her sweater to reveal a tight fitting t-shirt underneath. Even through her clothing, William could see her nipples were like rocks. He took a deep breath, and catch the scent of her arousal.<br />
<br />
Even though they both spent last night working each other over, they felt just as horny. It never ceased to amaze them how drastically their libidos have changed. It’s like an perpetual state of lust. Well maybe not that bad, but at times like this, it feels that bad.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s go somewhere we won’t contaminate the food.” William said. Martha happily followed her husband downstairs. There in the dimly lit basement, the smells of stale sex and cum washed over the,. Like when you walk into the perfume section of a department store. It’s hard to ignore those smells. It’s even harder when those smells make you hard.<br />
<br />
William slips his pants and underwear off while Martha tears his shirt from his chest. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go a bit slower this time. I want to REALLY enjoy this.” she whispered. William nodded, and let take point (so to speak). Martha straddled him, her pussy leaking onto his chest, while her butt cheeks were planted right above William’s flag pole of a penis. <br />
<br />
She leaned forward to kiss his face, slowly lowering her butt onto his shaft until its head was teasing her outer lips. William fought back the urge to transform, and let his wife continue. Martha let her own transformation start to come out. Her tail pushed from her body, little by little until it was its fun size, and bushy as ever. It tickled William’s lower extremities when she moved it. <br />
<br />
“Your turn.” Martha whispered. She rolled onto her side, and William felt his own tail extend from his body. While his furry appendage grew, Martha let the fur from her tail creep up. By the time William’s tail was done growing, Martha looked like she was wearing fuzzy pants. Her feet stretched into fox paws, complete with small claws and black tips. <br />
<br />
William smiled, and sighed as his own fur started to cover him. His penis inched forward, as a cream colored sheath extended from the base. His scrotum became just as furry, and soon enough William too had on a pair of fuzzy orange pants. His feet changed, and Martha lowered her own growing muzzle onto his cock. <br />
<br />
“Oh fuck!” William said, as his foxy rocket grew harder, and longer. It shook with need, and seed. Martha took a paw and brushed it against her husband’s lengthening ears, and then brought one of his paws up to her enlarged breast. <br />
<br />
“Good to go?” she asked, her transformation over. William smiled a true foxy grin as his face turned into a muzzle, and he ran his tongue over his lips. <br />
<br />
“Don’t you know it.”</p>
