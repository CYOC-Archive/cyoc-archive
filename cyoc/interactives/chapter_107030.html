<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was something wrong here - as we ran towards the mall I suddenly remembered that it was still oh-dark-thirty - the mall would not be open before 8 or 9.  But then I realized there were a lot of cars out, and people on the street.  I pulled my iPhone out of my pocket - noting the screen saver was a candid shot of the gawky ginger kid - and saw that it was just a little before 9 PM.  Was it 9 PM the night before?  Or 9 PM the next night?  In any case, Runt must have done something to change time.  Wow.  In some ways that was more scary than any of the other changes I had seen him make.<br />
<br />
The mall was busy, with another hour before closing.  When we got inside, Lee headed for the food court and I followed.  Lee, my older brother.  This was getting stranger by the minute - or more natural.  I remember my past, but now there was another history in my head, one where I grew up as a Chinese boy, went to Middle School, and had a brother.  Speaking of whom - Lee made a beeline for the Burger Palace and took his time ordering fries and a soda from a blonde-haired hunk who looked to be about 16.  The kid looked like a jock, not overly muscled, but lean and trim like a baseball player or swimmer.  Nice blue eyes, even teeth, a really nice smile.  It was obvious he was enjoying the chat with Lee.  That reminded me.  I had my own interest to check out.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the ginger was in the demo area of the Apple store, playing Asphalt 6, the racing game.  I was momentarily surprised to recognize the game form the limited glimpse of the screen, but  then &#39;knew&#39; all about it and many other games.  Chen was apparently a gaming nerd.  My redhead was apparently one too, for he was beating the crap out of the  other two players, both older teens.  I had only watched him from a distance before, but as the player standing next to him put down his controller in disgust and left, I grabbed it and stepped in to take his place.<br />
<br />
I &#39;remembered&#39; that the ginger was new to my school, and we had English together.  His name was Sam O&#39;Conner, and he had recently moved here from some place in England.  There were some rumors that he was gay, but since he had only been here a few weeks, no one knew for sure.  Luckily, the school kids were pretty much OK with me being gay - sure, there were a few jerks like anywhere, but it was never worse than some insults and a few guys avoiding me.  I hoped Sam would not be one of the latter.<br />
<br />
Sam looked me over as the new game started, but then focused on the race.  The other two players were older than us, but it turned out I was just as good as Sam.  He&#39;d lead for a lap, then I would take over.  It was more fun than I thought, and I actually got lost in the gaming until we shot across the finish line side-by-side.  The screen flashed &#39;Tie Winners!&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned to grin at Sam.  &quot;Great race!&quot;  He smiled back, looking very shy.  &quot;Uh, yeah.  I guess.  You play a lot?&quot;  His British accent was a real turn-on, even if it was not pronounced.<br />
<br />
This was my first time for real, but my memories now indicated I had it at home.  &quot;Yeah, I have it on my computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wrinkled his face into a frown.  &quot;My mom won&#39;t let me play video games at home.  It really sucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took a chance.  &quot;You wanna come over and play in my room?&quot;  <br />
<br />
I could see the interest in his eyes, and I did not think it was just the game invite.  But then there was a flicker of something else.  Fear?  I could tell he wanted to say yes, but something was scaring him.  &quot;You know we&#39;re classmates, right.  You and I have English together.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded.  &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re Chen Mayinjing.  Up front on the right.&quot;  Then he flushed suddenly and looked at his feet.<br />
<br />
A quick check of &#39;memories&#39; confirmed my assigned seat in English.  It also indicated he had been paying as much attention to me as I had to him.  I nodded, then grinned.  &quot;And you&#39;re Sam O&#39;Conner, fifth seat third row.<br />
<br />
He looked up at that, even more flushed than before if possible.  His cheeks looked to be the same red as his hair.  But he had a cautious grin starting.   &quot;I heard some guys in gym class talking about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever they said was probably true.  I heard some stuff about you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
His grin widened a little more.  &quot;Yeah.  Probably true.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of this was getting me aroused, and there was a lot of me despite my age.  But it was also getting very real.  Being Chen felt almost normal to me, way more than I thought it should.  This was different than being a younger redhead.  It felt like I was becoming a different person!  Maybe I was.  But Runt wouldn&#39;t send me off to a different life, would he?  I didn&#39;t want to lose everything he&#39;d given me after just a few hours.   I tried to remember what had been said.  Lee had said he&#39;d become pure Chinese, well hung, and five years younger if he could see me do the same thing first.  Did my agreement count as a wish?  Maybe I was now Lee&#39;s younger brother, a normal kid.  That didn&#39;t seem like a bad thing.  Maybe part of my mind was already locked into being Chen, because I was more interested in Sam than my whole future!<br />
<br />
&quot;So.&quot;  I decided we had danced around enough and reached out to give his butt cheek a quick squeeze that made his eyes pop open.  &quot;You wanna come play in my room?&quot;</p>
