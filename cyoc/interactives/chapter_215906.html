<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One golem down. <br />
<br />
Palskes started crooning, the soft strum of her loot strings contrasting sharply with the harsh, draconic words coming out of her mouth.  Still, despite the seemingly contradicting tones flowing through his ears, Charlie couldn’t help but feel invigored as his heart began to beat in tune with the rapid pace of the song.<br />
<br />
Then the golems swiveled their heads and their visors flared a bright crimson color. <br />
<br />
Charlie cursed.<br />
<br />
Really? Right off the bat, huh? <br />
<br />
“Their visors are glowing!” Charlie shouted over Palseks’ draconic melody.<br />
<br />
Charlie had done a Very Bad Thing ™. <br />
<br />
He’d told the Rangers that when the visors glowed they should stand still to evade the rays, as the golems could only see moving targets. That was, obviously, a lie. He had seen how accurate the golems were when the wolf had been taken out. There was no evading that, not unless you were a Rogue like him.<br />
<br />
As the party had entered the ruins, he had pulled Palseks aside and told her the truth: the Rangers were the sacrifice play.<br />
<br />
Yes, it was mean and probably evil, but they were just NPCs. Charlie’s brief experience with the golems had made it clear how much power it took to fire that ray, and he didn’t think they would be able to move much – if at all – while it was going. <br />
<br />
Charlie might not know much about DnD, but he did know gaming in general.  These golems had abilities that were way too high for their level, which meant that they must also have a corresponding weakness.  This was that weakness, and if they wanted to survive, Charlie needed to capitalize on it. <br />
<br />
Sure, they’d likely lose a few Rangers to the rays, but by his estimation, there were only thirteen golems in the entire facility. Charlie had more rangers that that at his disposal, and as long as he didn’t need to drop below zero rangers – and therefore sacrifice an actual player to the golems – it should be fine.  <br />
<br />
Palseks had seemed uncomfortable with it but agreed with his reasoning.  After all, as real as this felt, it was just a game, right?  These rangers didn’t have souls.  They weren’t living, thinking beings.  Sacrificing them was no different than sacrificing a unit in a real time strategy game.  At least, that’s what they had both agreed to.<br />
<br />
So, when Charlie shouted his warning, the Rangers froze.  Then, just as planned, two rays shot towards them, bathing the rangers that they hit in red light. <br />
<br />
What didn’t go to plan was the third that shot at Geoffrey.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey tried to block it with his adamantine gauntlets, but the big polar bear was too slow and got struck square in the chest.<br />
<br />
The final ray, fired by the spidery golem in charge of sorting prisoners, shot straight at Charlie himself.<br />
<br />
He dove to the right, barely dodging the beam. It caught the edge of his cloak and a wave of warmth traveled up it, the fabric unraveling as it went. Charlie quickly ripped the cloak off of him, only to see the fabric turn black and harden into a thin chitinous shell.<br />
<br />
When he rolled back to his feet, he realized that he’d made a big miscalculation.<br />
<br />
The golem that had missed with its attack immediately shut its ray down and scuttled towards Charlie on spidery legs. Charlie hadn’t expected that the golems wouldn’t just stand still if they missed. <br />
<br />
Of course they wouldn’t.<br />
<br />
Shit, he’d planned to sneak attack the mostly stationary golems and take them out, but now he was locked in one-on-one combat with the spider golem.<br />
<br />
A metal leg tipped with a sharp claw speared towards his chest.<br />
<br />
Charlie managed to parry the blow but the strike flung him five feet back. <br />
<br />
He managed to keep his feet but cursed to himself. This was the worst possible match-up for him. The spider golem didn’t look human. It was just a squat, round body akin to an astromech droid from Sun Battles. It had arms with pincers that it used to pick up coffins and four scuttling spider legs tipped with blades.<br />
<br />
Rogues struck by targeting vulnerable body parts. On the more human golems, he could guess where those parts were based purely on anatomy and where the armor plates were located. You generally covered vulnerable parts with armor. However, the spider golem was just a tube on legs.<br />
<br />
Charlie wasn’t worried that he couldn’t take it out, he was worried that he couldn’t take it out fast enough. He could disable a leg, but it had three more to stabilize itself. In order to beat this thing, he needed to disable 5 separate limbs, which would take him longer than 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
Charlie turned to see what Oswin was doing, only to realize that the stag was far more concerned with what was happening to his own rangers than Charlie or Geoffrey. <br />
<br />
Oswin wasn’t going to save Geoffrey, who was currently naked, his clothing having disintegrated in seconds and his cock erect. The real transformation would begin soon. No, Oswin wouldn’t save Geoffrey unless Veles asked him to, and even then...<br />
<br />
Charlie dodged more blows from the spider golem’s legs and glanced behind him to see what the situation was like. The Rangers were, as he’d suspected, targeting the golems who were attacking their friends, no archer firing at the same golem. That was a huge tactical blunder. They should be focus firing the golems down one at a time.<br />
<br />
“Oswin!” Charlie called. “Save Geoffrey! He has adamantine fists! He can save the Rangers! Veles, use your spells, this thing has me tied up, I won’t reach him in time!”<br />
<br />
Veles nodded and fired off Scorching Rays at the golem that had caught Geoffrey in its beam. And not a moment too soon, either. The big dumb butler’s cock had already started gushing cum as the bear’s body warped and shifted under the beam.<br />
<br />
Charlie turned back to his opponent just in time to badly parry another flurry of leg blades. He gasped as they tore straight through his leather armor and slashed him open in four different places. Shallow cuts, thankfully, but if Charlie hadn’t turned around when he had, he’d be dead.<br />
<br />
He heard the plinking of crossbow bolts on different golems. Charlie didn’t need to turn around to know they were still firing at different golems like idiots. That was unacceptable.<br />
<br />
“Rangers!” Charlie shouted at the top of his lungs, “I don’t care who you save, but target one golem at a time!”<br />
<br />
He dodged the golem’s pincers and saw that Geoffrey was beginning to shrink, his cock spouting bursts of cum. No! He needed to be strong to act as a front-line fighter!<br />
<br />
The spider golem’s mouth opened.<br />
<br />
Charlie had to make a decision. <br />
<br />
Deal with the golem or break away and try to save Geoffrey before he was transformed into something useless. On one hand, the spider golem was a dangerous opponent to have at his back, but on the other hand, losing Geoffrey was too big a loss for the party.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Time paused.<br />
<br />
Erwin was in heaven.<br />
<br />
The dragon was so handsome and loomed hugely above him, getting larger every passing minute. Finn was currently drinking from a two-gallon bottle of Croak-A-Cola with a crazy straw. Erwin had his own drink and his crazy straw was two feet long and throbbing. Another delicious burst of precum splashed against his tongue and he gulped it greedily down. <br />
<br />
Scales had spread across the human’s head and down over his proto-snout. In a few more minutes, he’d be looking like a proper kobold. Erwin’s eyes might be on the screen but all his focus was on the dragon’s lusty pole.<br />
<br />
Each swallow of precum had refined his sense of taste. <br />
<br />
Erwin could detect subtle and flavors to the dragon’s precum now, like a wine sommelier at a fancy restaurant. Finn’s precum was elegant and heady, with a robust flavor and a meaty mouthfeel to the thick liquid. The taste was harder to pin down, smoky and herbaceous one moment and fresh and fruity the next. <br />
<br />
And the musk-oh, the musk! It rolled off that draconic cock and was so deep and complex that his nostrils couldn’t help but snuffle at the wondrous bouquet of scents. There were layers to it and he was sure another sniff would send him deeper.<br />
<br />
In other words, Finn’s cock was amazing. <br />
<br />
As the blue scutes spread across his body, he was finding everything about the dragon amazing. His mind kept insisting Finn was his master, and honestly he didn’t mind. Who wouldn’t worship the scaly paws of such a magnificent creature?<br />
<br />
Master Finn was so glorious… mmm! So amazing… ah! D-delightful… *slurp*<br />
<br />
The kobold-to-be continued sucking, not really noticing that the screen he’d glued his eyes on had been paused for about a minute now. Above him, he heard a rumbling purr of pleasure from his master and promptly ejaculated, his shrinking testicles squeezing tight involuntarily. Little spurts of cum shot merged with the precum in his lap. <br />
<br />
“Come on, little one,” Finn cooed, stroking the sides of his eager kobold’s cute little snout with a claw, “Hoho, I know you are eager, but it’s time to make a choice.”<br />
<br />
The proto-kobold pulled himself off Finn’s cock and let out a little burp, a bubble of precum bursting from one nostril. His slitted eyes looked up at his dragon with pure love and affection. He nuzzled against the dragon’s claw, basking in the affection.<br />
<br />
”Yes master?” Erwin asked.<br />
<br />
The dragon booped Erwin’s snoot and chuckled. “You are just too cute! It’s time to make a choice. What should Charlie do?”<br />
<br />
Erwin opened his increasingly reptilian maw and said…</p>
