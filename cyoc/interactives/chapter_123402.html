<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And you&#39;re wanting to use the cellar as a &quot;punishment chamber,&quot; am I hearing you right?&quot; Maggie asked to the human police officer from the Lyre PD and the wolf officer from the Animalia PD who were presently talking to her about the cellar underneath the shop/building her modeling school was in.<br />
<br />
On the outside, the building didn&#39;t have a tremendously outstanding look. For a while it had been a dance all that people had come to gather in for many social functions years ago, and it was in that that Maggie had found the open space to work with to help set up her modelling school on its first floor. On discovering a cellar underneath the floor, Maggie did some research and found that a previous owner had run a &quot;speak easy&quot; there in the twenties and was complete with a second set of stairs that would allow costumers to escape should anyone attempt to bust up the speak easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;More along the lines of ultimately rehabilitating her,&quot; the human officer said slowly, &quot;and all would be technically legal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming she&#39;s found guilty,&quot; Maggie answered referring to Heather Wilcox, as the trial hadn&#39;t started yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re one hundred percent sure she&#39;ll be found guilty,&quot; the human officer spoke, &quot;between what the witnesses to her attack at the high school said and what her mole at Horizon confessed to... she will be found guilty of attempted murder/attempted infection with the Animalia Virus, and conspiracy to commit murder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only question as to whether or not she will be judged to be sane, insane, or sane but heavily influenced by Saurian instincts,&quot; the wolf officer added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m to let you do this for...&quot; Maggie began, &quot;What now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The speak easy&#39;s cellar back door opens into an area where there would be few if any witnesses,&quot; the human officer commented, &quot;and the alley it opens to is sturdy enough to prevent her from escaping...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that the Rhino Guard will be constantly present to make sure she can&#39;t take advantage of those administering the &quot;punishment&quot; that Miss Vivian has in mind,&quot; the wolf officer spoke, &quot;she won&#39;t be a threat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... so?&quot; Maggie then said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;All we need is a lease to the cellar,&quot; the human officer spoke, &quot;in pure theory would could claim eminent domain on the issue... but we don&#39;t want to have to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as my students and Animalia stay safe from that monster, I&#39;ll lease it,&quot; Maggie sighed, &quot;She&#39;s done ENOUGH to everyone here...&quot;<br />
<br />
In that both officers nodded. Heather Wilcox&#39;s attack on Sophie and Roland had had a lot of negative results that came from it. Those who&#39;d been completely against Animalia were using the attack as a means to justify doing all sorts of cruel things to Animalia, and it didn&#39;t surprise her that among those tweeting out vile negativity was the President, himself. Thankfully for the moment, the bill in the Senate didn&#39;t seem to be too draconian in nature. From what Maggie had seen reported on the bill, it actually had bipartisan support and was actually rather moderate.<br />
<br />
That still, however, didn&#39;t really endear Maggie to the tweet storm that erupted once the attack on Sophie and Roland made the news. The claiming of being right all along and demeaning Animalians as ugly was ugly in and of itself, and in Maggie&#39;s eyes hypocritical based on what had happened during the IAC...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The fashion show for the IAC had been a great success, as the various companies that had been coming up with designs for clothing to help Animalians have things that would be both fashionable and comfortable, and had found Maggie&#39;s school of modeling to be an good starting point to have Animalians to model their ideas. And from what Maggie had been able to watch, the regular part of the show had gone quite well. The second part of the show was to show what had also been done with regard to underwear. In that it would mirror what went into a Victoria&#39;s Secret Shoot done in New York. <br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t too much that would really need to be changed with regard to most designs. With men&#39;s underwear limited to boxers, briefs, or &quot;boxer-briefs&quot; that were a half way between the first to, there was surprisingly little alternation that had needed to be done. For most of them, the alteration was an opening that was like the fly that would be on the front of a man&#39;s pants to fit an Animalian&#39;s tail. The larger the tail was in terms of diameter, the larger this opening would be. Some designs came in that showed more marked alteration were some that the company had said would be for those Animalian&#39;s with larger tails in which there was a larger opening and with a strap with a button that went over the top edge. The button would then hold the underwear together The woman&#39;s underwear designs had similar alterations, though Maggie had found that the woman&#39;s underwear was designed to be &quot;sexier&quot; than the men&#39;s underwear, but in terms of letting her male and female students practice, Maggie had decided to along with it.<br />
<br />
The one area where clothing needed major alterations was with women&#39;s bras. For many mammal Animalians, it actually wasn&#39;t a problem, the only real anatomical difference between an Animalian female and a human woman was that the Animalian would have a larger cup size. However, with bird and bat Animalians with the fact that their wings were on their backs, that made the standard bra design problematic. The wings would be almost precisely where the shoulder straps were to go and depending on the size of the wing, they could also interfere with the back strap. The company that had provided the outfits came up with an idea for bird and bat Animalians that pretty much seemed to cross lingerie with a one piece swimsuit that had the straps wrapping around the arms before going around the front to cradle the Animalian&#39;s breasts with another set of straps that went around behind in a &quot;V&quot; formation where it would meet up with the panties that were mixed in as one piece of lingerie. Maggie hoped that would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s out there,&quot; Martha said slowly as Maggie made her way in the area behind the stage.<br />
<br />
Maggie looked over to see one of her human students helping Martha with her attire. While a lot of her school was intended to help Animalians find new careers, that in a way their muscular and curvaceous bodies worked very well in, its successes had soon found that a fair number of applicants had come from across the country to learn from Maggie, since she&#39;d had a successful career as a model before becoming an Animalian. Many of the human students stated that they had no intention of becoming Animalians, but they&#39;d also said they enjoyed interacting with the Animalian students as they all went through the various classes. Right now with the IAC, however, the human students had to work in helping their Animalian classmates be ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s out there?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The President!&quot; Martha answered in mixed surprise and nervousness, &quot;the same jerk that&#39;s spent his time badmouthing Animalia is there in the front row!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maggie sighed and shook her head. The IAC had attracted a large amount of attention from around the world. Some were rather irritated with the fact that the Russians had sent some of their own security agents under the claim of helping with security, but they had behaved themselves and weren&#39;t outright causing trouble. The biggest thing had been that the President, himself, had come to see the IAC. It wasn&#39;t expected, given the President&#39;s stated opinion on Animalia, but it was something would have to be worked with. Clara had agreed to a handshake, but had left it at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not every audience is going to be someone you like or may personally like you,&quot; Maggie advised, &quot;and this may come for various reasons. You can&#39;t control that. The thing you have to remember is that as a model, you must act professionally, which means you cannot let any personal feelings get in the way of doing your expected job. Just ignore that he is there and show the rest how truly beautiful... or handsome... that you are. That goes for ALL of you, human and Animalian alike.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods and understanding that had gone along with that. And from there, the show went on. Maggie did her best to introduce the model and the specific style that had been provided for the IAC&#39;s Lingerie portion of the Fashion show. She did fairly well, but she did notice that all through the show, the President, seated in the front row was practically drooling over every female model and moving his hands in a way that outlined the shape of an hourglass as each female model made her way out along the catwalk with an almost lust filled grin. In this, Maggie found him no better than some of the other perverts out there that liked Animalia because they thought that the only thing Animalians did was have sex.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s got the hypocrite in chief raising more political trouble for Animalia as a result of whatever her game was,&quot; Maggie spoke to the two police officers, &quot;the man spent the IAC lusting after my students like some teenager looking at dirty pictures and now he&#39;s out there back to the same ugly tweets that may well cause us a LOT of trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
The human police officer slowly nodded, &quot;trust me... A lot of people in Lyre understand. And that is why we will continue to work with Animalia in regard to making sure that Heather Wilcox ultimately pays for what she&#39;s done. Horizon may have interest in getting information from her, but she will face justice and your students will be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully... the current President lasts only one term,&quot; the wolf officer commented.</p>
