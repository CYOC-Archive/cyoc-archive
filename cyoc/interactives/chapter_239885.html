<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lion carried Steve, and his rancid stench, into the room, drawing a round of gagging from the anthros within.<br />
<br />
“You guys are going to have to deal with this.  I think she’s a doctor!” Leon said to the room.  The female anthros, including the nurses, all stopped gagging at once, as though they were no longer affected by the skunk smell.  Steve knew that wasn’t true.  Internally they probably wanted to vomit, but their master had given an order and they were going to obey.  It also revealed another interesting fact – every female in this room was a slave, including the nurses.<br />
<br />
The otter, on the other hand, pinched his nose shut, though, like Leon, he seemed to understand the gravity of the gravid situation well enough to hold his ground.  “Can you take a look at Austin?” he asked, as though he didn’t quite believe that the overly gravid, naked skunk in front of him could be anything other than… well…  Then what he looked like, Steve told himself.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I…” Steve felt that his body had answered the question, and he felt the tinniest bit of freedom enter his body.  Then there was the way the otter himself looked – he was so professional in his white lab coat with a stethoscope.  There was even a badge hanging off of his coat pocket.  Not that Steve could read the nametag but, if he could, Steve could imagine that it would show that this otter was an expert in anthro gynecology.<br />
<br />
As Steve looked at the otter who was very clearly a doctor specializing in birth, that female instinct that he’d felt as a rabbit came roaring back.  ‘This man is a doctor.  He’s here to help you give birth.  You’re a pregnant girl, you don’t need to worry.  This *man* will take care of everything for you.’<br />
<br />
Steve wanted to shout that he wasn’t a girl.  It had worked before in helping him to keep focus and drive these instincts away, but he didn’t want to waste the opportunity that this limited window of freedom offered him.  Mustering what little willpower a breeding slave could, Steve finished his sentence by asking the most intelligent question that he could, “… but, aren’t you a doctor?”<br />
<br />
The otter looked down at himself and cringed.  “Sorry man, I know how this looks but uh… my name’s Henry and uh… I’m kind of like… you know… a cashier at the Pizza Palace…”<br />
<br />
One of the rabbits then spoke up, “My name’s Julio and I drive uber.”  An identical voice came from the rabbit next to her, “I’m Todd and I’m in college.”  <br />
<br />
Finally, the last of the rabbits spoke up in the same squeaky voice as the others, “I know what I look like but I’m not a nurse, or a girl, or… I’m not pregnant.  I’m not pregnant!  I’m not…” Julio grabbed her hand and said, “he gets it, Joe.  Try to stay calm.”<br />
<br />
Steve realized that he was still panting and unable to catch his breath.  Leon felt Steve begin to droop in his arms and helped him sit down on the bench next to the mouse.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry master,” Steve panted, “I just need to catch my breath.”<br />
<br />
Both the lion and otter had cringed at the sound of the word master, but neither had enough time to respond to it when the mouse sitting next to Steve spoke up, “master, can Jack and I please move next to Mike?  She smells so bad.”<br />
<br />
Steve closed his eyes as he felt his cheeks blush under his fur.  He knew just how badly he smelled, which was humiliating enough.  Having someone else point out just how much of a burden Steve was creating on the other people in the room just added to that humiliation.<br />
<br />
Leon sighed as he approved the mouse’s request.  The mouse and fox got up and slowly moved next to then hen on the other side of the room – all while Steve pondered the absurdity of his humiliation.  He’d literally turned these people into pregnant slaves.  Within a few days, all but two of the former men in this room were going to go through an agonizing labor before a baby ripped its way out of their vaginas and thrust them straight into motherhood.<br />
<br />
Steve didn’t care that he had forced them to undergo the agony of labor, so why should he care that he was now forcing them to breath in his skunk smell?  Steve looked at the panting bitch on the birthing table.  If he wanted to avoid ending up like her – spread legged as a crowning head was firmly wedged into his stinky cunt, then he needed to keep it together and man up.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t the first time he’d found himself with a baby in his belly, breasts on his chest, or a tight little cunt nestled just above his asshole.  He’d gotten out of that last situation because none of that meant that he was a girl.  None of it meant that he was pregnant.  He was whatever he wanted to be, not what the app had made him into.  And whatever the app made, Steve knew that he could unmake it.<br />
<br />
Steve’s internal pep rally was interrupted by a moan from the other side of the room.  Looking towards the source of the sound, he saw the fox girl rubbing the top of her stomach as she gasped, “please calm down… please calm down…”  Then Steve saw the sudden impression of a foot kick out from underneath her fur.<br />
<br />
The women in the room all noticed as well, and each of them glanced at the fox with a distinct look of unease on their faces.  The fox’s kit was thrashing about, and former men who had all lost out on the dice roll that had turned them into pregnant anthros knew that they could be next.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Steve, whatever was in his stomach decided that it wasn’t going to be outdone by a mere fox kit.  “Unnnffffhhhh…” Steve moaned as the creature inside of him began thrashing around.  Just like in the car, the creature’s powerful movements caused the pressure in Steve’s belly to increase exponentially until he felt like his stomach was going to pop.<br />
<br />
Steve closed his legs, using his thighs to cradle the bottom of his stomach, all while he wrapped his arms around his belly button.  Hugging down as hard he could, Steve tried to turn his arms into a band that would hold his belly together in the face of his baby’s relentless struggling.<br />
<br />
“Nnnnnffffffff!” another high-pitched moan escaped from Steve’s mouth as he felt a massive thump against the top of his womb.  He looked down, only to wish that he hadn’t.  There, pushing up into the fur on the top of his belly, Steve could see the outline of something thick and cylindrical – like a reptile’s tail.  His uterus felt like it was going to explode as he watched the outline in his fur thrash to the side before the creature inside of him calmed down and the outline sank away to nothing.<br />
<br />
Steve looked up and saw that the rest of the room was now staring at the top of his belly.  Leon just covered his mouth, while the otter managed to stutter, “I’m sure that’s… normal for whatever we’ve all been turned into.”<br />
<br />
That fake optimism did nothing to help the doe sitting to Steve’s right.  She pulled her legs against her belly and hugged them as she began rocking back and forth in a fetal position. <br />
<br />
“Oh god,” she cried as tears formed in her eyes, “is that what’s inside of me too?”</p>
