<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not a damn thing made sense anymore. None his memories, and not what he saw when he came out to greet his mother. Looking at her, seeing how cross and tired she was, thoughts springing he didn&#39;t know where from telling him she worked double-shifts, one as waitress at a restaurant, the other at a clinic as a nurse&#39;s aide, and Damon suddenly had seconds thoughts. Conflicting memories crowded his head as he recalled the ways she tried to be supportive of him, yet, at the same time, the ways she&#39;d tried to access the funds he had available. Remembering both how she&#39;d moved them in with her sister, his Aunt June, because his dad died, but also ran out on them, he questioned which was real, and what had been created because of his tamperings.<br />
<br />
Something whispered inside him the new reality he lived in was one where his mom was a broken, sad, tired woman who&#39;d tried any number of times to cheat her son out of his finances, who, after he&#39;d made the changes to his life, had ended up abused worse by his father, and was now this pathetic shell of a person he saw. Emotions flaring, he was torn between feeling sorry for her and angry at how much she was dependent on him, how much she had tried to hurt him, not physically, but emotionally and financially, as well as the way he was forced to cover both their half of the rent, Damon listened as she greeted June, watched as his mom gave him a searching look which had a slight hint of disapproval to it, all before asking him, &quot;What you got there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just something I&#39;m been tinkering with,&quot; Damon replied in an off-hand way.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re always &#39;tinkering&#39; with something,&quot; his mom hissed at him before snapping, &quot;Why don&#39;t you stop fiddling about and actually do something with your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I am still trying to work out what,&quot; he shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;The boy&#39;s always &#39;tinkering&#39; with something, jumpin&#39; from one project to the next, never finishing anything. And for what? What I ask you? To be a twenty-five layabout with no job and no prospects for the future. Just fool about with something you&#39;ll get bored with and dump halfway through, if that. And if it isn&#39;t incomplete projects, you&#39;re always hanging about with those hood friends of yours, who I know exactly what you do with them. Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Last part addressed to his Aunt June, Damon glowered at his mother as June commented, &quot;Uh-huh. Don&#39;t you know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enraged with the both of them, unaware he had even started to scan his mother with the remote, Damon shot back, &quot;So, what?! I ought to be like you two. Find someone who&#39;s gonna up and run out on me?! Who&#39;s an abusive shithead?! Maybe I ought to be like you, mom. Have myself a kid you clearly didn’t want. And when they land themselves a series of money which sets up for life, I can spend more most their life trying to steal it from them, then, when my life falls apart, be dependent on them for a place to live, groceries, that sort of stuff. Maybe I can be like your sister. Always looking down my nose at other people, especially family, all because I think I&#39;m special and run my own business. Act like I am some charity and make my own family feel like heels, all the while taking them in,&quot; and turning in place before either could say anything, he stormed off to his room.<br />
<br />
With a slam of his door, Damon leaned against. Listening as his mom and aunt started to talk amongst themselves, he knew they&#39;d likely get a point where they&#39;d end of screaming at each other. No longer caring how much his reality might have been altered, sitting down in front of the laptop he&#39;d taken from Jack&#39;s place, he plugged in the emitter and watched as his mom&#39;s profile appeared. Scrolling through it, learning what he could, his mind soon wandered as he wondered what he ought to do.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, he thought he should do something nice for her. &quot;Maybe give her a better life, like I did with Aunt June,&quot; he reasoned. Yet, on the other hand, his mind still filled with conflicting memories, his anger at her still high, he wondered if maybe she was undeserving. Questioning his choice to alter Aunt June, toying with the idea of maybe also changing her, he set about altering his mom&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
A quick click, and he changed her species to elephant. Leaving the sex and gender as female, he fiddled with the programme until he managed to get it to accept how, once every twenty-eight days, for one week total, she&#39;d transform into a male rabbit. Smiling at this last bit, he set the set the slider for how sexually active her rabbit form would be to as high as it&#39;d go, made it so she&#39;d nail either male or female, and any offspring she produced, either a rabbit or an elephant, would be normal and nothing like her. Continuing through her profile, he set it so her mind would be one hundred percent animal, her change to her dominant animal form would have minimal discomfort, everything would be permanent, and only he would be aware. Clicking through the options, his anger cooling as he did, Damon stopped questioning after some time whether he was doing to right thing, or if it was wrong for him to force these changes on others. Finishing, he added a timer for when her change would begin, saved the new profile, and sent it to the emitter before ejecting the thing.<br />
<br />
Collecting several things, he shoved it all into a backpack before picking up the emitter. Exiting his room, he made sure the door was closed tight, locked it, and headed for the dining room. Seeing his Aunt June sitting at table, eating supper, he didn&#39;t bother saying anything to her and instead headed for the living room. His mom lying on the couch, staring blankly at the muted television, he watched her for a minute before aiming the remote at her. Engaging it, he listened as it hummed, felt it vibrate in his hands, and when his mom glanced at him, demanded to know what he wanted, Damon spat, &quot;I&#39;m going out. You shan&#39;t have me around this evening,&quot; and turning away, he headed for the door, stopping long enough to grab his coat and shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; his mother snapped in a cross tone as she went back to staring at the silent tv.<br />
<br />
Her night passing like it usually did, Chloe barely paid attention to anything around her. When her sister told her she needed to throw Damon out, learn to stand on her own, she almost began to cry, as she wanted to tell the other woman she was trying, knew she needed to do exactly as June said. Disliking her son, not only because of how financially lucky he was, but also because of his lifestyle choices and how much he reminded her of his father, Chloe wondered if maybe she ought to tell the boy to get to stepping when he came back. Feeling like this was the right thing to do, that she would be better off without Damon around, she never got the chance to, as he never came home. And when she left for work at five the next morning, he still wasn&#39;t back.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to go to work, as she&#39;d awoken with a migraine and was feeling cramped, Chloe knew she had to if she wanted to make ends meet. Dressing in her uniform in the staff locker room, then heading for the breakroom, Chloe checked to see if anything had been left for the nurses on duty for breakfast. Not seeing anything, knowing she wouldn&#39;t get anything until lunch time, she reported to her station, then, along with one of the nurses, began the rounds. Everything uneventful, her morning slipped by, and around eleven, she was dismissed for an hour lunch break.<br />
<br />
Back in her street clothes, Chloe checked how much she had on her. Seeing she had enough cash for a small meal, she headed down to the ground level and exited the multi-story clinic. Her mood sour because of how she felt, which had been getting worse all morning, she stumbled when someone ran into her. The person continuing to walk on, she turned to them and opening her mouth, she tried to tell them to watch where they were going, she was shocked when what came out was a sound close to what an elephant would make.<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling too hot, she turned and without watching where she was going, she somehow made her way into the alley between the clinic and the next building over. Dropping her purse, he clothes starting to feel way too tight, she gasped and before she could stop herself, made a trumpeting sound as the seams on her shoes popped. Feet exploding out of the confining footwear, Chloe began to tear at what she had on as her body temperature spike, she was overcome with the worst case of horniness she&#39;d ever experience, all as her weight started to balloon upward.<br />
<br />
Clothes falling to pieces as her weight jumped up over seven thousand pounds and her height began to increase, Chloe was finding it harder and harder to focus on anything. Humanity being stripped from her, replaced by the simple mind of a beast, a part of her understanding on some level she ought to be horrified with what was happening to her. Her nose extending as her head began to reform, she trumpeted again, and this time the sound was closer to what she was become. Needing something to satisfy the ache, the buzzing tingle in her privates, she looked around at the bleary world, and let forth a call to announce her need. Trying to take a step forward, her body too cumbersome to walk on two legs as her hands and feet morphed to accommodate the near-ungulate she was becoming, she dropped to all fours.<br />
<br />
Ears, large and floppy formed and she shook her head and extended her trunk. Skeleton rearranging to better suit the animal she was become as her height settling around 11 foot, eight inches, the twenty-five-year-old female African Bush elephant let forth a sound to first announce her need, then to locate others of her kind. Her skin darkening as a tail grew outward, she backed up slowly and tried to turn around in the confined space. Oblivious to how reality was altering around her, the female elephant stepped on something. Unable to see it was the remains of Chloe&#39;s shoes, she at last managed to turn around. Smelling the open savannah before her, her bestial mind took full control. Every last thing which might have been Chloe was shed and she uttered another series of calls. And when an elephant responded, a male, she let for a call of her need and started toward them as the final thing to prove what she used to be, her clothes, vanished.</p>
