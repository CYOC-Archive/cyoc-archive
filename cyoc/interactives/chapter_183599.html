<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had many doubts about the virus, but whether or not the virus was the cause behind this situation is beyond you; you throw her hand of off you and dash for the door. You lock it from the inside before you slam it shut with you, breathing hot air into the friends crowded around you. You body froze in the moment as everyone stared at you. Every now and then, someone ducked their head in to try to catch a glimpse of Miss Jackson, but didn&#39;t move from their spot. You could not even attempt to explain the situation.<br />
&quot;Dude, what gives?&quot; John was the first to break the silence, &quot;She&#39;s into you. How did you pull that off?&quot;<br />
&quot;I always thought that she was into men her age,&quot; Aaron chimed in. <br />
&quot;Then why the hell was I in there?&quot; Before your voice could rise any higher, everyone quietened you.<br />
<br />
You could hear movement behind you, but there was no real way to tell what your newly lust-induced teacher was up to.<br />
&quot;Well, you were the first person.... who did it on the first shot.&quot; Zac was beaming as he grabbed your shoulder.<br />
&quot;So, we couldn&#39;t see too well — what happened in there?&quot; John was back to his joking personality again. You took a deep breath, ignoring whatever was going on behind the door. You looked at you closest peer, hoping that he would make the right call.<br />
&quot;John, do you remember what you said about the virus on the news?&quot; He looked back with a puzzled look. &quot;I&#39;m starting to think that you were right.&quot; John took a moment to take in your statement while everyone else looked at each other.<br />
&quot;What virus?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re talking about the bimbo one. The news is one-sided these days.&quot; Todd whined.<br />
&quot;You guys haven&#39;t noticed miss has been acting odd? At all? We have almost always have been trying to catch whatever we could and out of nowhere she is literally giving us a tease — on purpose. This is not like her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, but how is this different? How do we know that this isn&#39;t just you chickening out?&quot; Todd narrowed his eyes as he stared you down.<br />
&quot;She grabbed my dick.&quot;<br />
&quot;Way to go—&quot; Everyone cut off John as you all notice a teacher passing around the corner; he gave a suspicious look before he carried on. <br />
&quot;Okay then, follow up question: what virus?&quot; Zac&#39;s eyes darted from one person to another.<br />
&quot;I still think that it&#39;s bogus, but it supposedly is able to turn anyone infected with it to turn into a full on, air-head, cock-craving, emotionally manipulative, cum-slut of  a whore.&quot; Everyone turned to Aaron, even you: he was never the kind of person to do this. &quot;What? It&#39;s the media messing with infor—&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey guys? She&#39;s masturbating in there — half-naked.&quot; There was an instant commotion as everyone surrounded Zac, who was staring into the classroom from a side window. You held the door shut: you were not going to risk it at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone, there is a god; my prayers have finally been answered.&quot; John&#39;s voice was shook with disbelief.<br />
&quot;Have we been missing this this whole time?&quot; Todd muttered.<br />
&quot;And to think, who knew.&quot; Aaron sighed. You could hear it now — you could hear Miss Jackson moans just behind the door, you could feel the anticipation in the air and you could sense trouble.<br />
&quot;Does anyone know if she dyed her hair today?&quot; Zac asked. Everyone agreed that she did looked different.<br />
&quot;Her tits are massive now,&quot;<br />
&quot;I just want to fuck those lips,&quot;<br />
&quot;Shit, man, look at her ass,&quot;<br />
&quot;Does she know that we&#39;re here?&quot;<br />
&quot;To be fair,&quot; you start, &quot;I could hear you guys over her up until now.&quot; Todd eyed you before Zac pretended to moan like a bitch in heat. Some of them laughed until you heard Miss Jackson over all of them.  They all gaped as they saw her start forcefully fucking herself with whatever it was she was using, almost screaming the dirty words they had all dreamed she would one day say to them. After one last cry, there was quiet. Then they all recoiled.<br />
&quot;She saw us!&quot; John panicked.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going in,&quot; Zac marched up to you, &quot;Aaron, there is a packet of condoms in my room under my bed. No questions, grab it — we are doing this.&quot; He turned to you as Aaron dashed off. &quot;Charles, would you kindly let us attend to Miss Jackson? She is unwell and that was too much for me to try to rub this one out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude, the virus.&quot; warned Todd.<br />
&quot;If it turns her into a mega-hot mega-slut, then it can turn me into a mega-hot mega-stud.&quot; You and John glanced at each other.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not how it works, man—&quot;<br />
&quot;This is a terrible idea—&quot; Zac moved you aside and entered the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Jackson, do you want me to check your temperature? You are soo hot that I can feel myself rising.&quot; You cringed at one of Zac&#39;s worst pick-up lines. But before you could react, John and Todd were already running past you after Zac. You tried to stop them but you only managed to close the door behind them again. The teacher from before looked over at your direction — chewing on a sandwich — before he walked off again. Luckily, he did: you could hear moans start to grow behind you. Dragging the bag racks from under the window, you wedge it underneath the door handle; you check how secure it is before see the situation. You dropped your jaw as you watch Zac holding a bimbo of Miss Jackson while she chocks on his meat. Her clothes were either scattered across the floor or torn to reveal the soft flesh underneath them. Zac had his pants around his ankles as you could see his shirt tighten from what you could guess to be his new breasts rather than his thinning muscles. The others were nowhere in view with everything blocking the rest of the classroom, but they were quiet. Zac&#39;s hair started to flow from his head into curvy waves at his shoulders while his legs became softer and more luscious while his moans rose into a cuter voice. You stare in terror until you notice his leg hair fading into nothingness. He would still be distinctly male with the right clothes, but he wasn&#39;t the cocky hothead he once was in his current state. Aaron bolted up to you from the corridor with a bulge in his pocket.<br />
&quot;I have the condoms.&quot; He panted as he tapped his pocket. &quot;Is everyone in there already?&quot;<br />
&quot;Shit, man, shit, shit, shit. You have to help me.&quot; Aaron looked in the window before dread took hold of him.<br />
&quot;Okay, okay. The virus is real. What&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br />
&quot;This is a long break, so, even with,&quot; you check the time, &quot;ten minutes gone, there still a long way to go until the next class starts.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, do we keep this to ourselves or try to get help? This situation is too crazy for us or anyone sane enough.&quot; Aaron was losing it.</p>
