<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad climbed back through his window and stretched his body.  He ached all over like he had stretched on a rack or something.  His eyes drifted back to the window and Dirk.  He shuddered.  He could feel those broad shoulder and tight ass inside him stretching him like he was a Spandex singlet.  Damn, why was his mind going there.  Chad stripped and went to his bathroom to shower.  He felt so dirty.  He scrubbed and scrubbed until he smelled like soap all over.<br />
<br />
He toweled off.  That weird Dirk stink was gone.  He felt relieved.  The hot water had helped with his soreness too.  His cell phone was ringing.  He plopped down on the bed and answered the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad here.  Who&#39;s-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, it&#39;s Rick, where the fuck are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, still in bed.  I think someone slipped me something yesterday, I cannot remember a thing after school until I woke up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget about practice?  You told coach, you&#39;d be here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right?  Yeah.  I&#39;m just so sore.  I don&#39;t know what happened last night, but I feel like I got run over by a truck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how soon can you get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; Chad said staring at his wall clock.  It couldn&#39;t be afternoon already, could it?<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nearly 1 PM, Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, frigate!&quot; Chad said.<br />
<br />
Rick giggled. <br />
<br />
Chad could taste something weird in his mouth.  It was like Spandex fabric.  He felt really insubstantial. The phone was getting hard to hold.  So he put it on speaker and lay down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, bro.  I think whatever drug they slipped me is still working.  I feel so weak, I don&#39;t -don&#39;t think I -I can make it-&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad stopped speaking.  He lost consciousness.  Rick was concerned and raced over to Chad&#39;s house with the coach.  The phone was on Chad&#39;s bed, and the line was still open, but Chad was nowhere to be seen. In the locker room across town at Taft High, Dirk was taking his new singlet out of his gym bag.  He sniffed it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Soapy clean! So thoughtful of you, Chad.  But no worries, I&#39;ve got a few tough matches, you should be smelling like my sweat again by the end of the day.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Chad wasn&#39;t really aware of anything, as Dirk put him on.  Dirk&#39;s first match was easy, and Dirk barely broke a sweat.  The second and third matches were more serious, and went all the rounds, and Dirk was dripping with sweat at the end.  The last match was the worst, Attila was Dirk&#39;s opponent.  (Who names their kid Attila anyway?)  Attila managed to give almost pin Dirk twice, and give him a wedgie while he was at it.  At the last minute, Dirk threw Attila, and pinned him with his crotch grinding in Attila&#39;s face. Attila&#39;s fingernails snagged in Dirk&#39;s singlet creating three parallel runs on his ass.<br />
<br />
Dirk was so relieved he won, he didn&#39;t notice the damage until one of his teammates commented when he got back on the bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dirk, you&#39;re still wearing your singlet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you got a problem with that, Reg?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, but after Attila snagged your new singlet, I figured you&#39;d take it off to keep the runs from getting worse.  That&#39;s all,&quot; Reg said.<br />
<br />
Dirk cursed Attila under his breath, and took a nap on the bus.  When they got back, he checked the damage in the locker room, and applied some tape to the snags to keep them from running more.  Then without changing out of his singlet, he put on his street clothes over them.  Then he bicycled home.  He cut through Chad&#39;s yard on the way home, and stared into Chad&#39;s empty room. He had planned to get Chad good and sweaty before the snag, so he decided to go through with it.  He knocked on the back door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Tad,&quot; he said when Chad&#39;s brother answered, &quot;Chad said it would be okay to use your sauna in the basement sometimes.  I had a rough match today, and was wondering...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on in, Dirk. One rule you have to wear a swimsuit or underwear, no bare butts on the seats. Got it?&quot; Tad explained, as he led his neighbor to the basement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just wear my singlet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever works for you.  Set the timer, so you don&#39;t bake yourself.  You should come out and shower or at least cool down every 10-20 minutes,&quot; Tad explained setting the controls. &quot;I usually like it really hot,&quot; he turned up the dial, &quot;Chad&#39;s more of a wimp, he sets it for 100-120, I go for 140-150.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;140-150 sounds good to me,&quot; Dirk replied.<br />
<br />
Tad smiled.  There&#39;s bottled water in that cupboard.  Stay hydrated. I&#39;d join you, but I&#39;ve got a date.  Oh, just lock up when you&#39;re done.  Chad&#39;s probably out with his buds until the wee hours, and the folks are staying overnight in Springfield.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk grinned.  He stripped down to his singlet.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll take a while to heat up, Dirk.  You may as well work up a sweat on the cross-country ski machine.  See ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk climbed on to the machine, and soon had it on a high setting. He was panting and sweating like a dog.  After 30 minutes.  He stopped, and sauntered into the sauna.  The wave of heat hit him hard.  He grinned and lay down on the wooden bench.  The timer chirped.  He got up and slowly got out of the of sauna.  He climbed in the shower, and drenched himself and his singlet.  He drank some of the shower water.  Then he toweled off, and grabbed a bottled water.  He spent the next 120 minutes going in and out of the sauna.  The last time, he was exhausted and peeled off Chad and stretched him out on the branch to dry.  Come six or seven tomorrow morning, Chad would resume his human shape, and wonder how he ended up in the sauna.<br />
<br />
Dirk put on his street clothes, and played some of Tad and Chad&#39;s videogames, while Chad lay in the sauna with Dirk&#39;s sweat baking into him.<br />
<br />
That night Tad got home sooner than he&#39;d planned.  His date had left him blue balled.  He headed down to the sauna to make sure it was off, and found it was still on, so he decided he&#39;d sweat out some of his frustration.  He stripped down to his boxers, and then he noticed Dirk&#39;s singlet.  He picked it up and sniffed it. Then he shucked his boxers and put on Chad.  He lay down, and fell asleep.  Fortunately, the timer had run down.  He got out of the sauna and drank a bottle of water, and then two cans of beer. He went upstairs and lay down in his bed.  It was after 9 am, when he woke up.  Tad was still wearing Dirk&#39;s singlet. He had had a wet dream.  He peeled of the sweaty sticky singlet, and tossed it in the shower. Then he grabbed his robe, and went downstairs for breakfast, and to watch TV.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Chad awoke. He was doubled over in his brother&#39;s tiled shower stall.  He wanted to puke.  He couldn&#39;t remember anything since talking to Rick on the phone yesterday.  He was naked, and he stank.  He almost turned on Tad&#39;s shower, but decided to use his own.  He snuck down the hall naked, and into his bedroom.  There were a dozen missed calls on his phone.  He decided he&#39;d call back after showering. He really stank this time.  He smelled like a locker room, as he was drenched with Dirk&#39;s, and Tad&#39;s sweat.  Tad was a good 8 inches taller than Dirk, and so Chad was particularly sore from the stretching he received.  He noticed three large parallel bruises on his back which corresponded with the smaller snags in Dirk&#39;s singlet. He rubbed his head. With a towel wrapped around his waist he picked up the phone. Most of the calls were from Rick.  He hit redial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, where&#39;ve you been?  We went over to your house when you stopped talking and found your phone, but you were gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was?  I passed out.  Just woke up i-&quot; he almost said in his brother&#39;s room, but continued, &quot;about 30 minutes ago. Don&#39;t know where I was.  I&#39;ve got bruises across my back to boot.  Just got out of the shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, sounds like you got roofied or worse.  We need you to go to the hospital.  I&#39;ll pick you up in ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad really couldn&#39;t argue with Rick, so he got dressed.</p>
