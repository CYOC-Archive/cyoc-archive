<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“That foul creature does not belong here,” An angel glaring at Michael; brandishing his blade as he prepares to defend the gates of Hevean.<br />
“I am Arch-Angel Michael Morningstar,” the irritated angel carrying the peacock demon Pava in his arms; “With me is Penemue, daughter of Jehovah, You will stand down and let us pass,” Michael glaring daggers at the guard.<br />
“Buh buh buh by order of Kushiel,” the guard stumbling to speak but failing do to outright fear. Michael tired of this minor angel, prevents him from continuing to speak by ramming his fist right into the frighten man’s face. He crumples to the ground in an unconscious heap; Michael and Penemue just step over him and pass through the gates.<br />
 <br />
“Was that necessary,” Penemue commenting as they both use their wings to fly to the healers.<br />
Michael refuses to answer as he keeps sight of his destination. With a heavy gust as uses his wings to land; Michael shocks the bored attendant as he places the demon on a stretcher.<br />
“By order of Jehovah,” Michael glaring; “lord of lords, king of heaven and all that other bullshit.” Michael shoving the stretcher while passing the attendant; “get every healer present and help heal this poor wretch from her injuries.”<br />
<br />
“You certainly have a flare for a dramatic entrance;” Michael pausing to see Jehovah and sighing. “Do as Arch-Angel Michael commands,” Jehovah looking at the attendant.<br />
The attendant too shocked to objects runs inside the temple to do as he was commanded to.<br />
“So this is Pava,” God looking at the unconscious peacock demon; “and that is a wound from a chaos being.” Johovah staring at the female demon’s abdomen; bloodless yet black lines of pure darkness can be seen traveling through her veins.<br />
God looks up to see the healers arrive just as Kushiel busts his way through.<br />
“What is the meaning of bringing a demon,” Kushiel’s ranting trailing off as he see Jehovah standing next to the unconscious creature.<br />
“Get back my liege,” Kushiel brandishing his sword; “I’ll dispatch it in your name!”<br />
“Do that and you lose your head,” Michael drawing his blade and preparing to battle.<br />
“You dare draw your blade against the Grand Inquisitor,” Kushiel snarls; venom practically dripping from his words.<br />
“I sit at the right hand of god,” Michael stepping between Jehovah and Kushiel; “I answer to him and him alone!”<br />
<br />
“Enough you two,” Jehovah speaking calmly; “stow your blades.” Jehovah nods to the healers as he grants them permission to take Pava away. Giving Michael a nod, the arch angel bows as he backs off and watches god approach Kushiel who is now kneeling.<br />
“Grand Inquistor,” God beckoning the angel to stand; “why do you barrel into this sanctuary of healing with intent to cause harm?”<br />
“You majesty,” Kusheil stumbling to form his words; not realizing that Jehovah already here to great Michael Morningstar, he mindlessly stammers as god places a calming touch on the Angel.<br />
“Please tell me you have news to the whereabouts of the missing Iron knights,” God smiling; “where is Reverend Josiah Church?”<br />
“I know not,” Kusheil catching his breath and quickly forming a lie; “I heard reports that they are hiding in hell. I assumed that Lucifer,” Kusheil spitting the name in Michael’s direction; “and his foul horde fell upon and destroyed them.”<br />
“Lucifer Morningstar,” God looking at Kushiel with mild disappointment; “is not like that. Plus, I want to have a word with Church for how he assaulted my daughter. You remember Penemue,” God gesturing to the other angel in the room remaining silent as she records the conversation as is her duty as chief archivist of heaven’s library.<br />
Kushiel finally spied the daughter of Jehovah; “my apologies,” Kusheil being stiff with his pleasantries. “But that demon,” Kusheil trying to speak but was silenced before he could continue.<br />
“That demon Pava,” Jehovah speaking in a more measured tone; “is here because I allow it. You will honor my wishes,” Jehovah staring at Kusheil; “you will treat her as if she were an honored guest. You will afforded her the same rights and protection as any other resident of the kingdom of Heaven,” Jehovah raising his voice to a thunderous level; pressing the point to the now shamed grand inquisitor.<br />
<br />
Michael chuckled softly as he observed Grand Inquisitor Kusheil apoplectic expression as was ordered by Jehovah himself to sacrifice his life to protect a demon. A demon, that Kusheil would happily kill; treaty be damned. All Kusheil could do was smile and bow to Jehovah as he mutterd, “by your command then.” Watching him fly off, Michael could only glare at the departing Angel. He knew that smile was false and the bow forced. Michael was worried the Kusheil would do something foolish to regain a shred of honor that his dearest friend just stole.<br />
“Jehovah,” Michael shaking his head; “I fear his up to something,”<br />
“Put you trust in me,” Jehovah smiling at Michael as he places a kind hand on the shoulder of Michael; “for it will be your shield from chaos.”<br />
“I hate it when you speak like that,” Michael rolling his eyes in disgust; “It makes it sound like you are up to something sneaky.”<br />
“Only because everyone else,” God beckoning Michael to follow him to the healers; “is trying to sneak around me.”<br />
“You already suspect he is up to something,” Michael shaking his head; “how? When?”<br />
“Patience Michael,” God answering; “a young demon need help.”<br />
<br />
****************************************************************************<br />
<br />
“Change of plans,” Kusheil barging into Semyaza’s office. The Grand Inquisitor seething at the orders god gave him. “I don’t want to wait to crash a weddings in purgatory.” Kusheil glaring at the one angel whose cruelty matches his own.<br />
“What has happened,” the angel, staring at Kusheil as the Grand Inquisitor takes a breath to calm down before speaking what just transpired at the healing temples. Unbeknownst to either, a cherub was sitting outside on a ledge next to an open window. The cherub listening as Kusheil rants that he suspects Jehovah knows more than he lets on.<br />
<br />
**************************************************************************<br />
<br />
“You recall your brother’s revolt,” Jehovah speaking to Michael as they observe the healers examine Pava. Jehovah requesting Penemue to head to the archives to file the latest interaction with Kusheil; “It was the one day I was caught completely off guard.”<br />
“I remember it like it was yesterday,” Michael shaking his head; “I still bare the scars of Lucifer’s betrayal.”<br />
“We all do,” Jehovah whispering; not wanting the healers to hear the next part, “Lucifer was duped by Beelzebub to start the revolt. Kusheil was the first to report it.”<br />
“So that explains his hatred to me,” Michael answers; “I’m the only Morningstar Kusheil can vent on.”<br />
“Something like that,” god sighing; “but I’m getting of topic. That revolt was a catalyst for something bigger. I didn’t realize it until after the treaty between heaven and hell was inked.<br />
“I was there,” Michael sounding wistful; “It was the first time in ages that I was able to hug my brother.”<br />
“I swore never to be caught off guard again,” Jehovah looking up to see a cherub approach and whisper something in his ear. “Thank you, and continue your observations.”<br />
“The cherubs are spying for you,” Michael looking stunned; Michael recalled that Jehovah created them from the souls of human infants that died upon birth. Jehovah’s reason was they should not have to suffer such a cruel fate and be punished in hell for the chance that their birth caused the death of the mother. “I thought they just fly around and sing?” Michael looking stunned; “you know, spread your message of love as it states in the humans’ religious texts.”<br />
“That is their cover,” Jehovah chuckling; “what better way for a spy to observe unnoticed, by not acting like one?” Jehovah looks at Michael as he watches the baby angel zip away to where it was originally; “they have been keeping an eye on Kusheil.”<br />
God getting up as the healers have finished their examination and beging to approach. “Wait a moment,” Jehovah addressing the healer before turning to Michael; “that Cherub just reported that the Iron Knights that were hiding in hell are now here in Heaven. Kusheil arraigned it in return for killing Beelzebub. Now they are now Angels. Stay by Penemue and her Fiancé’s side,” Jehovah ordering Michael; “Just in case they try to go after them.”<br />
<br />
Michael ponders what Jehovah has just revealed to him in regards to the cherubs. He knew that Kusheil could not stand them as they always sang their joyous songs at the most inconvenient times. He heard Kusheil tried to swat one dead, but the cherub was fast and easily evaded Kusheil’s wrath.<br />
Michael was about to portal to the library to guard Penemue and Josh when a firey portal began to open in front of him. Too small for a demon to come through he was surprised to see Cruciata Carronfly on the other side. Her compound eyes all teary eyed as she started to blubber about how she was being arrested for the assassination of her father, illegal espionage, weakening the anti-Chaos seals of Hell and Earth.<br />
The last charge in regards to the seals caught the ear of Jehovah and approached to see the distraught demon in chains.<br />
“By the darkness,” Cruciata gasps as she sees god for the first time; “its you.”<br />
“In the flesh,” Jehovah keenly interested in what Cruciata has to say; “So what is this about weakening the wards in hell?”<br />
“I have nothing to do with it,” Cruciata crying; frightened at seeing the man her father taught to hate and revile. Yet Cruciata had a hard time showing hate, as the man exuded nothing but compassion.<br />
“I know,” God raising a hand to silence the distraught demon; “I also know you don’t have much time for your communication portal so I’ll be brief. Pava’s wound is serious be there is hope. Cruciata teared up with joy at the news of Pava. “Love,” God speaking calmly; “Love is a powerful form of magic. It is the antithesis of chaos. Chaos fears it. Love is what will save Pava.”<br />
“How,” Cruciata tries to respond but was once again silenced.<br />
“Pray for her,” God speaking; “pour all your love into a prayer. Reach into the deepest recesses of your heart and pour out your feelings,” God speaking in a reassuring tone; “profess your love. Your love is the only way to save Pava.”</p>
