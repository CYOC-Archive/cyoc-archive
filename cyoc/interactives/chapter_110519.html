<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex and Nate made their way out into the parking lot for high school and rapidly met up with Ben as they approached his car. They found him talking on the phone with someone at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Security?&quot; Alex and Nate heard Ben say, &quot;Is something going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate and Alex continued to approach and paused on the other side of Ben&#39;s car while Ben continued to talk with whoever was on the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang...&quot; Ben said politely, &quot;I can&#39;t say what it is... just stay safe.&quot; There was a pause for a few moments. &quot;I love you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Ben hung up and looked over to Nate and Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something&#39;s going on at the college,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;Kenya said she was getting coffee when a bunch of campus security walked buy their cafeteria/commons building as if they were on a mission...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be a random black bear that&#39;s wandered in,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;it has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully that&#39;s all it is,&quot; Ben nodded, &quot;So... what&#39;s the plan for you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll head back to my place,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;and work through our homework. If you want to join the &quot;homework party&quot; until you go to meet with Kenya, you&#39;re free to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it would be good to be able to just hang out too,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;You know, doing best buds stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can save that for a hunting trip some night,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;I&#39;ve got a couple of other things to work on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing that Ben was referring to a couple of sketches that Ben was wanting to perfect, Nate and Alex only shrugged and they climbed into the car to head back toward where the Twist and Anderson homes were. The carpooling made since and worked out well for the three of them as Nate and Ben were neighbors, and while Alex didn&#39;t live on the other side of the Andersons or the Twists, it wasn&#39;t like he lived on the other end of town. For Nate it was a big thing, as while he had the appropriate licence that a sixteen year old would have with regard to vehicles in the State of Washington, he had no vehicle to use. He remembered some talk about getting a second car for either Martha or for him, but that was just before his father&#39;s affair with a student went public and the money that would have gone toward a second car went straight to child support for an illegitimate child. <br />
<br />
But Nate was fine with riding with Ben and Alex as he had found a good friend in Ben and a boyfriend in Alex that was progressing far better than Nate could hope for, given that Alex was his first real beau. A part of him was still a bit puzzled on what Alex had said about a prophecy dream regarding Alice, the girl Alex said they would adopt in the future, as none of the books he&#39;d read on werewolves or other shapeshifters had ever given them that sort of power. Now, those books may have only been folklore, but they did still shape a lot of what Nate expected about werewolves and being one. The fact that weres had prophecy dreams was new to him and left him with a lot of questions. When would he and Alex get married? When would they adopt Alice? Would their respective careers do well, and if so, how? He had a lot of questions and he found himself staring out the backseat window of Ben&#39;s car as they headed home. As his thoughts drifted, Nate lost track of time and awareness until he felt Alex shake his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Hey! Wake up!&quot; Alex said to Nate as he shook Nate out of his seeming stupor. He then looked to see Alex looking at him from the seat beside him and Ben looking back at him from the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Ben asked to Nate, &quot;You&#39;re not too worried about what&#39;s been going on in Seattle, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;m sure your mom is on top that,&quot; Nate answered as he climbed out of the car and soon had Alex following him, &quot;I was just thinking about something more personal... things that are still rather new to me with regard to actual lycanthropy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing bad, right?&quot; Alex asked while Ben had a similar look of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it&#39;s with good things, but things that leave me with a lot of questions,&quot; Nate admitted.<br />
<br />
Alex and Ben both looked to Nate and Nate eventually decided to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex... do you remember the prophecy dreams you said we had?&quot; Nate asked, &quot;about us doing well... adopting Alice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben blinked, but Alex nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What brought that on?&quot; Alex asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly just thinking on how well things were going for us and that it&#39;s been a big plus for me since Minnesota,&quot; Nate answered and looked to Ben, &quot;having a best friend.&quot; He paused to look back to Alex, &quot;and a boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the dream had us getting married and adopting Alice in the future,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;Not bad, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... but it just leads me to wonder on how we get there, who proposes to who?&quot; Nate agreed, &quot;and all the other questions about the details on how we get there and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prophecy dreams giving hints of things that has you curious, I take it?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, yeah,&quot; Nate nodded, &quot;though also wondering how it works?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom... Frances... would probably able to explain it better,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;especially on the fact that as Yoda says in the Empire Strikes Back that the future is always in motion. Prophecy dreams are NEVER one hundred percent accurate. They may touch on the future and come remarkably close if one lets it... but not exact. And telling prophecy dreams from normal dreams can also be tough... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could she tell for sure?&quot; Nate wondered, &quot;which is which?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Ben shrugged and patted both Nate and Alex&#39;s shoulders as they moved toward the Anderson house and Ben prepared to head to his own home, &quot;and with a lot of those details... if you know it&#39;s happy, I&#39;d say to just let it go. Worrying too much on the details may do more harm than good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just something that came to mind as I thought on how good things have gone for me since my family moved here,&quot; Nate said with a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;ll only get better,&quot; Alex smiled and hugged Nate. <br />
<br />
Nate only smiled and hugged Alex back, &quot;I suppose we&#39;d best get started on our homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex and Ben both agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Don&#39;t want your parents to demand we split up because your grades are slipping,&quot; Alex teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;My grades aren&#39;t slipping,&quot; Nate answered as Alex began to dart toward the Anderson home with Nate soon following in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said your algebra was &quot;killer.&quot; That&#39;d have to mean your grades are slipping,&quot; Alex teased again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it means its tough, it doesn&#39;t mean I can do it,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;besides I&#39;m not the one who can&#39;t remember how feudalism worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben only watched and shook his head as Nate and Alex jogged off, playfully teasing each other as they went. It brought Nate out of the curious and introspective thoughts on whatever prophecy dreams he&#39;d been having. From the way they described it, they had to be good dreams, but Ben figured that Nate being new to Moon Lake and were society might still have some period of adjustment to all the various things that went well beyond what even folklore and fandom could tell. <br />
<br />
Ben&#39;s own concerns focused more on what Kenya had said about Campus Security being active. It could mean that a mundane animal had wandered onto the campus, which had happened and would need to be driven out before the animal realized that it was among weres and the most likely response of a fight breaking out as the animal either feared attack or wanted to get rid of competition. As while the potential squabbles between weres and mundane animals weren&#39;t always friendly, they were less serious than the possibility of weres being exposed thanks a rogue wererat&#39;s stupidity or the other potential issues that arouse out of were society itself or from those outside it.</p>
