<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy and Heather were both surprised when Doctor Jones turned the focus of the group session over to them. In certain ways neither really wanted to be there. Jeremy had only gone to the lone session because an old college friend who was also working at Horizon had urged him to. It was a favor to a friend and nothing more. Of course in the lone session, Doctor Jones had asked him to come to provide some support for Heather with regard to session&#39;s purposes, which was to help Animalians and people find mates, and particularly with those who didn&#39;t quite socialize quite as well as others.<br />
<br />
From what Jeremy had observed so far, it did seem that Animalians did have the potential to have some of those same sorts of issues that people did. True most of them turned out to be transformed humans, but still, there was a lot that Animalia advertised that would make it seem like it was a perfect utopia that never had any problems, and thus even converted humans wouldn&#39;t have them after their transformations. And some of the scientific data from Project Phoenix had given various indications that the Animalia Virus had at least some effect in helping with those sorts of problems, but then, the virus might effect the release or presence of the specific hormones that went along with those problems, but still left the personality untouched. Which would mean that physically the new Animalian might be &quot;cured&quot; of the problem but would potentially still need therapy to &quot;get their head on straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
And while learning that Heather actually WANTED a mate was a great surprise to him, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean he was going to let her go it alone. He knew that there were a fair number of Animalians that weren&#39;t going to forgive her easily for her attack on Sophie and Roland. From what little contact he had outside his lab, he knew that Animalia LOVED its ambassadors and their show, and Heather&#39;s attack on them was bound not to sit well with them. And while at times Heather did push his buttons and had essentially blackmailed him into sending the Animalia Virus to her, in many ways they did get along, and in his own odd way... HE had forgiven her. He also knew that he really didn&#39;t have any room for negative judgement. In that he was more than willing to help her, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that he truly wanted to be there or to be involved in the other group session member&#39;s problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now... the point of the group session is to have everyone involved,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke from his seat, &quot;and in this atmosphere... there will be NO judging.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is easy to say... when you haven&#39;t done anything that people CAN judge you negatively for,&quot; Heather grumbled.<br />
<br />
Jeremy watched as there were a few nods of agreement at that. He figured that they all recognized Heather and had their respective judgements on Heather&#39;s actions. Jeremy also soon noticed that Heather had her fists clenched as she rested her hands in her lap, and with that he offered one hand, resting it on top of Heather&#39;s. This was what Jeremy expected to be doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;For me... I suppose it is easy to say,&quot; Doctor Jones admitted, &quot;but by a point of policy... it IS how the session is supposed to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she tried to EAT two people! At a school no less!&quot; Rosie protested with even Jill sending a suspicious look Heather&#39;s way.<br />
<br />
Heather only lowered her head, &quot;I was angry at the time and let my anger get the better of me... and was unprepared for a predatory dinosaur&#39;s predatory instincts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thus why many of us had to go through some courses in order to know what the animal&#39;s instincts likely were and thus be ready for them,&quot; Jill spoke, &quot;The American Alligator is a predator too... You wouldn&#39;t believe how often I&#39;ve seen an non-uplifted dog or cat and had something flash in the back of my mind that the animal would be food. But I knew on its base instincts when I was converted and thus prepared for them and could resist them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said I was thinking clearly,&quot; Heather said weakly and lowering her head again. In a way she knew she could probably take any of the Animalians in the room in a fight, but that really wasn&#39;t what she wanted to do. She wanted to show her grandma that she COULD do better than she had and get a new start. This was especially important as she&#39;d heard Tyra on the phone with some of the real estate agents in Alabama concerning her land she owned and had renting tenants on and with old friends on being &quot;young again.&quot; Heather knew that even if she wasn&#39;t under probation, she probably wasn&#39;t going to be able to get away with what she&#39;d done before. &quot;And like all of you... the desire for a mate is there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The instinct and desire may be there...&quot; Jerry spoke, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t excuse trying to eat children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re perfect?&quot; Jeremy spoke up, &quot;Huh? Just about all of you have had your own mistakes that you don&#39;t want to be judged for, I&#39;m sure, but Heather deserves nothing BUT judgement for her actions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Jerry began nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are ALL aware of the wrongs that Ms. Wrex and formerly Wilcox has done,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;but we are also aware that the attack was likely a result of her being unprepared for her new instincts as an Animalian and them then reinforcing decisions made in anger. And NO human can ever claim to have made good decisions when enraged or overtaken by emotion. Any emotion when overly relied on can lead to lapses in judgement and mistakes. It doesn&#39;t always excuse the mistakes, but it can explain them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that Sophie&#39;s actually FORGIVEN Heather and has been working to help Heather at Horizon as a volunteer for the Dinotopia project,&quot; Jeremy added, &quot;so if the victim of the attack can forgive her and give her some sense of trust that she wants to do better... the LEAST YOU can do is do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather lifted her head a little and smiled to Jeremy, though he didn&#39;t see her smile. There were a few voiced whispers of surprise, but that did seem to lower some of the hostility level aimed at Heather. That let Heather relax a little and let Doctor Jones move the session back in the sort of direction it was supposed to be going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we have that out of the way,&quot; Doctor Jones said slowly, &quot;We can move onto the matters that we are all here for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose if she is looking for a mate... that is understandable, and if Sophie forgave her... that&#39;d provide some hope for her making a new start,&quot; Judy said slowly, &quot;but wouldn&#39;t any sort of courtship have include some proof of reform? Can we help with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve actually gotten a surprising amount of fan mail,&quot; Heather admitted, &quot;though I think a lot of them are proto-typical &quot;bad boys&quot; or even &quot;bad girls.&quot; They wouldn&#39;t necessarily be the sort that would break the law or Animalia&#39;s edicts... but neither would they be the sort you&#39;d want to take to a formal dinner party. Most of the rest seemed to be obsessed with the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise and wanted to know which was tougher, T-Rex or the Spinosaurus... Not really the sort I&#39;ve had my eyes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There must be more to them than just that?&quot; Michael said slowly, &quot;surely all you got was a bad pick up line... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Heather said slowly, &quot;but my issue isn&#39;t so much about possible options... as there is someone that I know and I like and I&#39;m pretty sure he likes me... but... I&#39;ve never had a way that would work to catch his attention, at least not in a romantic way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you tried talking to him?&quot; Rosie asked slowly, &quot;I can understand being afraid of rejection and that sort of thing, I suppose... but coming out honestly would help...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy found himself nodding in agreement, with one hand on Heather&#39;s. By now her fists weren&#39;t balled up tight and he could actually feel Heather&#39;s other hand resting on his. The news that Heather was looking for a mate was a surprise to him, and in many ways blunt honesty might be the best policy if Heather had tried flirting and didn&#39;t get much of a response. Of course, a lot of this also related to his interactions with Polly. When he talked with her, she was often quite openly honest with regard to her opinion. In that he always knew what Polly&#39;s opinion was. <br />
<br />
Which of course lead to the revelations in Polly&#39;s and Marcy&#39;s visit.  He hadn&#39;t answered the calls or even checked the voice mails, because he&#39;d thought that Marcy&#39;s family was simply calling to rub it in, as by the time his incarceration had been up and he returned to his apartment, Polly was gone and neighbors had said that she&#39;d been shuffled over to WSA and they then turned her over to Marcy&#39;s family. What Marcy had commented on with Polly showed that his initial thoughts on the change in custody regarding Polly was wrong. It shaped some of his wish to make it up to Polly, but for the moment that would have to wait. For the moment he was there for Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Heather nodded, &quot;but... I suppose there is some insecurities over the past wrongs I&#39;ve done come into play. I want to be better... to try to do better. But... it doesn&#39;t change the past wrongs that I&#39;ve committed... And I&#39;ll have to admit that my treatment of him wasn&#39;t that great. I&#39;d think that he&#39;s likely forgiven me to some extent... but that might only be enough to be a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
That left Jeremy rather interested as to who this person could be that Heather liked. After her arrest, her access to the outside world had been rather limited with the only ones that had routine contact with her being the Rhino Guard and those working on Project Dinotopia/Mesozoic. To his knowledge, the Rhino Guard members remained rather gruff with regard to Heather weren&#39;t the sort to have forgiven her. At times he even thought that they were actually hoping for a fight in order to put Heather down. The only men officially on Project Dinotopia/Mesozoic were himself and Doctor Stein, but Doctor Stein was married with two kids. This guy was something of a mystery man, as Jeremy couldn&#39;t figure that Heather had access to anyone else on a regular basis. Some of that may have changed after her release, but then she still showed up at Horizon for what work that Doctor Stein had for her and Jeremy regarding Project Dinotopia/Mesozoic.<br />
<br />
&quot;It still wouldn&#39;t hurt,&quot; Jeremy spoke up to Heather, &quot;if he has forgiven you... admitting that you like him couldn&#39;t hurt... I&#39;d even come with you if you like. I&#39;d actually like to meet this guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know him very well,&quot; Heather answered and turned to him. Jeremy saw her flex the muscles in her neck, as if she was swallowing something, and then looked down to him. A small and weak smile forming on her muzzle. Jeremy only stared back blankly. &quot;He&#39;s you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Jeremy gasped, sounding far more hostile than he wanted, he was that surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve known each other since college,&quot; Heather answered, &quot;You helped me with the required science courses I had to take to meet the graduation requirements and you gave me critiques on my artwork... and you were fairly fun when your nose wasn&#39;t in a book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you never said anything,&quot; Jeremy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said my way of flirtation worked,&quot; Heather answered and looked down, &quot;and all too often... when that didn&#39;t work and we graduated... I turned to other tactics in frustration. They didn&#39;t work either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy didn&#39;t know how to answer. No one had EVER liked him in that sort of way. He had the sense that Polly liked him, but that was a sort of sibling love. The one person he&#39;d ever worked up the courage to ask out had laughed at him in high school. From there, with Polly&#39;s issues he&#39;d poured himself into his work. Had he really missed that much?<br />
<br />
&quot;Saying it now... it&#39;s about all I have left,&quot; Heather answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; Jeremy said slowly, &quot;I mean... it&#39;s not like I&#39;m really great boyfriend material... I&#39;ve often focused so much on my work that I&#39;ve let plenty of things slip... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are smart and you&#39;ve put up with me when I&#39;ve been grumpy... and that also goes back to college,&quot; Heather answered, &quot;and while I may have teased you with regard to how often you&#39;ve had concerns over Polly... the dedication you&#39;ve had to your sister is something I&#39;ve admired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jeremy said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if it could be arranged... I would go for a more romantic date than looking after Polly,&quot; Heather answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll still come for the Carnival, right?&quot; Jeremy asked, &quot;You may need to apologize to Polly and Marcy, as I&#39;ll be &quot;picking her up&quot; from their house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Heather answered. With some relief. She had managed to get it out and had been relieved that Jeremy had both stuck for her and seemed willing to accept that she like liked him. It was some first steps. There would be other hurdles, namely apologizing to Polly and her surrogate guardians in the short term, but there would be others. Like introducing Jeremy to Tyra, not knowing that they&#39;d already met and Effie had whacked him with her cane when Jeremy had made some irritated comment about Effie being a fossil. Then of course there would probably be the debate over whether or not Jeremy became a Dinotopian to be with her or if they ended up like Nick and Judy in that they&#39;d be together but their only option for children would be adoption... but it was a first step.</p>
