<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first time that day Merica opened the door using her house key. She looked inside and sighed &quot;You leave them alone... and they play till they collapse... and I suppose I&#39;ll have to-&quot; then something was happening to them... &quot;what&#39;s-&quot;<br />
&quot;You act like you can&#39;t sense time manipulation.&quot; Merica turned around and saw her mother. <br />
&quot;What are you doing to Canade?!?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just bringing her back with my younger self... With you being a Priestess now, she&#39;ll be happier there. So few people who love her here compared to those who hate her.&quot; <br />
&quot;...Whatever you are... you overtook mommy and now You take away my SISTER?!?&quot;<br />
Jane pouted a bit and said &quot;I know I may have been there for Canade a lot more than you, but she did need more attention. Everyone loves you, and you were blessed with everything. Very few saw Canade as anything other than cursed.You may not have seen the future, but don&#39;t worry we will have a lot more time together... and so much less time for Canade. With the way the timeline works I needed to give her something, and now she&#39;ll be able to live her life in a slightly more fair manner.&quot; <br />
Merica&#39;s fist clenched and said &quot;So because I was too good you ignored me... and when you were talking to me you were staring who knows when!&quot; <br />
Jane smiled and said &quot;Let&#39;s go on a trip. I&#39;m a little excited that I&#39;m the one of me that finally gets to do this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jane was nice and instead of just tossing John wherever she placed her and Canade in bed. Cindy walked in threw open the curtains letting in all the sunlight and cheerfully said &quot;Good Morning!&quot; John groaned as Cindy explained &quot;You told me to do that, also that there&#39;d be some sort of surprise you brought with you.&quot; Then two bodies fell out of the bed... certainly was a surprise for Cindy. <br />
John groaned and said &quot;Huh? When did I get back to the past or present or... I think I&#39;ll have to stop thinking in those terms soon.&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;I really wasn&#39;t expecting yet another teenage girl. Mind if I asked your name miss?&quot; Canade was next to John and looked around for something to write with. If her mother didn&#39;t know ASL yet there&#39;s no doubt her grandmother wouldn&#39;t know it either. <br />
John explained &quot;Well this is ugh, Canade she&#39;s my second daughter... and mute.&quot; <br />
Cindy not entirely sure how to react said &quot;Well this is... interesting... Kinda like seeing a preview of my grandchildren.&quot; At which point her phone rang with a special ringtone. &quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m going to have to take this... Hello this is Ms. Mavis... The teacher at Koya Tina... Yes this is the year 20XX... Huh? Why are you asking whether or not a mute albino was sleeping in the same bed as Jane?..I guess that&#39;s an explanation?&quot; Cindy ended the call and thinking about how to explain first said &quot;So Jane, you&#39;ve been busy in the future... or your future self has been pretty busy. She went around making deals with all sorts of people. So that Jane made a deal with Principal Abet to get Canade transferred in. Apparently outside of a few issues... she&#39;s earned enough credits from Yumi and was more than qualified to jump in... and Jane... you here and now can show her around today if that&#39;s fine.&quot; <br />
John finally piecing everything asked &quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound good Canade? I think I get what my plan was. No one here knows your my daughter or even related. You could live a relatively normal life.&quot; Canade however just kind of looked at John with a glare... Right she was from the future and just forcefully yanked from anything she could consider home. &quot;Well, normal for here at least. I&#39;m sure if this doesn&#39;t work out I&#39;ll go return you to the future. How about we at least try this out?&quot; Canade&#39;s glare softened, she was a smart girl and realized that she should at least give this a try. <br />
<br />
John put on a change of clothes pretty quickly, and then waited downstairs for awhile... She knew Canade was doing more than just putting on clothes as they had to find some of Dolly&#39;s old clothes since John&#39;s new clothes were either too big or too male for her... It could also be her putting on makeup... Should she put on makeup? She&#39;s gotten by without it so far, but as a Priestess maybe she should at least try to put on a little.&quot; Then Canade came down the staircase in a nice white dress. &quot;looking cute in that dress Canade.&quot; The Albino looked a little flushed. <br />
Canade held out a notebook that she scribbled in &quot;So I wanted to explain what exactly I was thinking. True I may be a little lonely if Mom and Merica were always gone, but I&#39;ve got Yumi and other who come by occasionally. Besides that I wasn&#39;t even asked if I wanted to be at this time or do any of this.&quot; There was a line she crossed out that said &quot;All my favorite games and shows won&#39;t even exist for decades&quot; her note then continued &quot;Besides that what about long term things? If I live with you then eventually our secret will get out and all our troubles will happen again. Couldn&#39;t you just send me back? I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;ll be able to take a step outside.&quot; It seemed Canade thought for a second and added in a &quot;Thanks about the dress&quot; scribble at the end. <br />
<br />
John said &quot;Ugh, your welcome. Listen if I planned out the whole phone thing in the future I probably planned all the smaller details as well. Come on let&#39;s meet this half way.&quot; and grasped Canade&#39;s hand and slightly dragged her outside to show her around town. <br />
<br />
At the park they rested underneath some trees. John said &quot;Alright, I get it bad idea to just drag you out in the middle of the sun like that. I already took care of the sunburns. However now that we&#39;re out why don&#39;t we just take a walk around? We could go towards the city or check out the markets or the mall.&quot; Canade made a scribbling motion on her palm. John sighed &quot;Fine, and I should&#39;ve taken your damn notebook. When we get to the markets or the mall I&#39;ll buy you any notebook or tablet you want.&quot; Canade then pointed to the sun. &quot;And I&#39;ll slowly rewind your skin so it wont burn.&quot; Canade was pointing to the sun and her eyes repeatedly and John saked &quot;And what does that mean?&quot; Neither noticed as a little blonde girl walk towards them, and of course they didn&#39;t notice as the girl&#39;s father came over to get his child. <br />
The father said &quot;There you are dear, about time we left. What are you looking at anyways?&quot; <br />
The little girl looking to Canade said &quot;She looks pretty...&quot; <br />
the father said &quot;reminds me a bit of snow a little...and that&#39;s Jane...&quot; said father happening to be Mr. Hill the owner of the mall. &quot;Hey Jane! shouldn&#39;t you be in school?&quot;<br />
John turned and was surprised to see her boss in the middle of a park &quot;Huh? What are you doing here?&quot; <br />
Hill shrugged his shoulders and said &quot;Spending some quality time with my daughter... and honoring a bit of a bet I made with some future version of you.&quot;<br />
John asked &quot;What deal will I make with you?&quot; <br />
Hill said &quot;You gave me a nice sum of money to get me to &quot;adopt&quot; someone, if my daughter went towards an albino girl in the park. That said we only just met. I&#39;d be surprised if you just wanted to hand someone off to me.&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;Say were you about to leave?&quot; <br />
Hill nodded and said &quot;I was going to check a few things out in the office, but yes. Need a ride?&quot; <br />
Canade nodded her head vigorously John adding &quot;It was a bit of a mistake to walk here to begin with.&quot;<br />
Hill said &quot;Well you can come with us. Least I could do for an employee like you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hill&#39;s daughter and Canade were in the backseat while Hill drove and John took shotgun. It was a nice car that drove smooth. &quot;...and how do you ask to go to the bathroom?&quot; the little girl asked and kanade tucked her thumb behind her index finger in her fist and shook. <br />
Hill took a quick glance in the rear view mirror and said &quot;Well they seem to enjoy each other... You didn&#39;t tell me who you wanted me to take in, but should I assume it&#39;s your mute friend?&quot;<br />
John said &quot;Yeah, future me thinks it&#39;s time for her to stay here in the present. However we&#39;d like to get her at least a notebook so we can really discuss everything.&quot; <br />
&quot;What&#39;s your relationship anyways?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... she&#39;s my future daughter, and i&#39;d like that to be a secret.&quot; <br />
&quot;Is she dangerous in any way? I don&#39;t know much about the future, but I&#39;d rather not accidentally let a nuke into my home.&quot; <br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s just because of the whole priestess thing people got superstitious.&quot; The care was silent for awhile. <br />
That was until Hill&#39;s daughter exclaimed &#39;Yay! I spoke in sign language!&quot;</p>
