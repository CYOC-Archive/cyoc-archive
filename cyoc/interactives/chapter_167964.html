<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff sat in front of the screen, and who/what he could evolve, his eyes drifted away towards a picture of him and his late girlfriend Alexis.<br />
<br />
It had been a year since the car wreck that had taken her life, and since then, he lacked the courage to move on. Sure he could use this machine to bring her back to life, but felt that even with the near-limitless power of this machine, there were some lines he shouldn’t cross.<br />
<br />
He had always been a bit of a furry, and had often fantasized about dating anthro girls, so he thought that perhaps he could use the evolution package to bring his fantasy to life. <br />
<br />
Now before he did anything else, he made sure that only he was aware of the changes he would soon make to reality. With that out of the way, he wondered how many years he would need to evolve all animals until they were all anthros.<br />
<br />
Jeff then found an option that would allow the screen to read his desires via handprints, and then evolve using only the years needed. He also made sure that all anthros would be human-sized, and would have human years so that they would be equal to humans. Above all, he made sure that no one would ever need meat to live. After all, he didn’t want his fantasy to be ruined by the food chain. Fruits, vegetables, and grains would be all anyone would need. No one would miss meat, not even himself.<br />
<br />
With the device ready, he hit “enter” just before his cat Sasha could catch a mouse. Everything was engulfed in a flash of white, and as the world came back into focus, he heard the voices of two girls his own age.<br />
<br />
“Sasha, why must you always tackle me like that?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Mizi, but you’re just so tackleable! Haha!”<br />
<br />
Jeff saw that standing where his pet cat and the mouse had been moments before was now an anthro cat girl and and anthro mouse girl. Both were properly clothed, and judging by their brief exchange, seemed to be friends.<br />
<br />
As he looked at them, new memories about them rushed into his head: Mizi the white mouse girl was from a family that shared a duplex with his family, and Sasha the Siamese cat girl was his childhood friend. <br />
<br />
Both of them liked to hang out with him, but they were just friends. ... For now.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, can you please tell Sasha to stop tackling me?” Mizi asked as she straightened her short white hair.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be such a girly girl!” Sasha said with a teasing grin as she brushed back her beige waist-length hair with her hand “You know I was just having fun.”<br />
<br />
Locking his pc so no one else would use it, he told them “Why don’t we go outside?”<br />
<br />
“Good idea.” Mizi told him “We could use the fresh air.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed.” Sasha added with a smile “That’ll give me more tackle room!” and she laughed while Mizi rolled her ruby red eyes, and gave a smile at them.<br />
<br />
As Jeff, Sasha and Mizi walked down the stairs, they saw Jeff’s eight year old sister Amy playing with her dolls.<br />
<br />
“Hey Amy.” he asked with a sly grin “Notice anything different?”<br />
<br />
“Should I?” Amy retorted as she continued brushing the hair of what Jeff saw as a dog girl doll.<br />
<br />
“Where’s mom?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“She’s off paying our landlady Queen Loam.” Amy replied “She brought over a few watermelons as our usual monthly payment. I guess we should be glad that ants are easy to pay rent off to.”<br />
<br />
As Jeff considered what it meant to live on property allotted to his family by an anthro ant colony, he heard a knock on the door. Opening it, he was greeted by a lovely anthro ant girl, who according to his new memories, was Princess Terra, who was next in line for her mother’s throne.<br />
<br />
She had grey skin, short brunette hair, large sensitive human eyes, a normal human mouth with full lips, no nose, and antennas poking out of her hair. Her shirt had extra sleeves for her additional arms, and there was a hole in the back of her pants for her abdomen. She also had a pair of insect wings coming out of the back of her shirt.<br />
<br />
Even though Terra was a princess, she still liked to dress casually, and was one of the more sensible girls that Jeff apparently knew in this new world.<br />
<br />
“Hi Jeff.” Terra said with a warm smile “I see you and the others are hanging out again.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Jeff replied with a nervous smile. He didn’t expect an ant girl to be this attractive.<br />
<br />
“Jeff and I were going with Mizi to the football field. We need more practice if we’re going to beat the other school.” Sasha told Terra with a confident smile.<br />
<br />
“I thought we were going to stay here and play on my latest game I bought for my system.” Mizi added with a nervous smile.”<br />
<br />
“Actually, I’m fairly certain that he and I were going to study for our upcoming history test.” Terra added with a gentle smile.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t know which of these lovely ladies he would go with. Of course, he could always reset the day with his device if he wanted to, so there were no real concerns, but for right now, which anthro girl does he go with?</p>
