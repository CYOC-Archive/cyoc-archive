<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, let&#39;s get a good look at you, &quot; said Elizabeth, as she walked into the room towards Jeff.  As she passed the semen on the wall, she wrinkled her nose.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Eww, what a mess.  I hope reality adjusts soon. I wouldn&#39;t want to be the one who had to clean up that mess, &quot; she said, as she wiped a finger through the pile of goo.  As they both watched, the slime slowly became lighter in color, almost translucent, then faded away completely.  <br />
<br />
&quot;There, that&#39;s better, &quot; said Elizabeth, as she stood next to Jeff in front of the mirror, examining him closely.  Elizabeth was taller than Jeff by about a foot.  They both had feminine figures, but while Elizabeth had a larger, bulkier, more muscular frame (like an Amazon), Jeff looked more like an aerobics instructor, with a thinner, but still athletic build.  Elizabeth&#39; coat looked exotic with fiery red fur, while Jeff&#39;s fur had a more elegant appearance with a fine gray coat with splotches of white fur.  They both had the long white hair on their arms and calves common to the Shire breed of horse, as well as similar muzzles and ears.  They shared enough features to look like they were related, and it was easy to believe that they were sisters. Jeff just stood silently staring at the mirror, still in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not too bad; pretty nice if I say so myself, &quot; she said with smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what did you do to me? &quot; said Jeff softly, almost a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?  YOU&#39;RE the one who did this to yourself.  I told you not to mess with the computer. You&#39;re the who played around with it.  You&#39;re the one who pushed the button that started the program, not me!&quot; she said shortly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn&#39;t want this!  These aren&#39;t the results I requested in the program, &quot; said Jeff, with a little more confidence born from anger.  He was surprised by how high and feminine his voice now sounded.  &quot;You must have done something to the program!&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth smiled coyly.  &quot;Maybe, &quot; she said sweetly.  &quot;But still, l told you not to use the program.  This is your own fault for not listening to your big sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How? Why?!&quot; said Jeff angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;How? Well ,that was easy.  I just modified the program, so that no matter what you input, the program would still only accept the parameters I set for it to run.  Simply put, regardless of what settings you entered, the computer would only run my settings and change you into the form I wanted.  A form like the one you have now &quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t look so surprised.  Even though I like horses, that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have other interests.  Like computers and programming.  I&#39;m actually pretty good at it.  I  guess you really don&#39;t know me very well, &quot; she said a little sadly. &quot;As for why, well ... I told you before, being like this is my lifelong dream.  I love it!  And I couldn&#39;t let you ruin it by messing around with the program again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why a female horse?  You could have changed me into anything?&quot;  he said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing changes reality in strange and unpredictable ways. I like the way things are now ..... I have a nice family, a good job where I get to see my old family and my horses, and a stable income to feed  my large appetite and clothe my unique body.  Keeping you as part of the family as an anthro-horse seemed like the safest way to keep things essentially  the same. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you made me into some big breasted bimbo?&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth laughed. &quot;I would hardly call those big breasts.  They are a B-cup, at best.  But you are still a young filly, and you might still have some breast growth ahead of you as you finish developing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Young filly....What do you mean you mean by that?&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth blushed a little.  &quot;Well, horse reproductive cycles are a little different than humans, and I couldn&#39;t exactly be sure how far apart we could be born and still be related, so I kind of, maybe, made you just a tiny bit younger.&quot; <br />
<br />
This keeps gets even better and better, thought Jeff.  &quot;Exactly how much younger? &quot;said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m seventeen, and the gestation period for a mare is about 11 months, so I made you 15 and a half years old.  I didn&#39;t change anything about Suzy, at least not intentionally, so she still should be around 12 to 14, depending on how much reality has changed.  I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re a middle child now, &quot; she said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly brightened.  &quot;Wait, if you had the program set to change reality, how do you remember any of this?  You weren&#39;t in the room with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh, it&#39;s all in the settings. &quot; said Elizabeth smugly.  &quot;You know, if you buy a computer program you should really read the instruction manual before you use it.  It helps avoid all kinds of problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was really angry now.  Not just because of what Elizabeth had done, but because she was right.  He should have been more careful and done a little more research before he started.  All of this really was his own fault.  &quot;Okay, okay everything makes sense except for one thing - why did you make me a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth smiled.  &quot;Well, I won&#39;t lie.  I am gonna miss that fabulous beast of yours.  I kinda hoped you might change your mind and agree to fool around later.  But, I thought, if you were going to continue to disobey me and mess around with the program  behind my back, you needed to be taught a lesson.  And it is really funny!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You evil bitch, &quot; he yelled.  &quot;You think this, &quot; he said, indicating his body, &quot; is some kind of joke!  My life is ruined!  I&#39;m a freak!&quot;  Jeff sat down on the bed and started to cry.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth was shocked by his reaction.  She had expected him to try to fight her - that was also a large part of why she made him a female.  She didn&#39;t want to have to deal with an aggressive male who could possibly overpower her.  Better to have a smaller, easier to control little sister.  But she didn&#39;t want to let Jeff know that. And now she felt a little guilty. She sat down next to him, and gently patted him on the back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;There, there.  It&#39;s not so bad being like this. I&#39;ll help you and teach you everything you need to know, just like a big sister should.  And you can have a lot of fun as a girl ... trust me, I&#39;ll teach you about that, too.  And if you&#39;re a good girl, and do what I ask, maybe... just maybe...I&#39;ll turn you back into a male if you absolutely hate being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  &quot; said Jeff, drying his eyes, and looking over at the computer. &quot;You&#39;ll let me change back.....maybe tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, &quot; said Elizabeth as stood up and walked over to the computer.  &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking, and I think you&#39;ve had enough fun with this thing for quite a while.  I&#39;m going to take it back to my room for safekeeping. Like I said, be a good girl, and I&#39;ll consider it .... some time in the future.  For now, you should just relax and get to know your new body.  After all, we still have a big day tomorrow - school and then our after school job at the farm.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a job? What kind of job?&quot; said Jeff curiously.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Since we no longer have your magic rod to provide us with the disposable income we need to feed and clothe three growing anthro-horse girls, you and I work as farm hands on my old family&#39;s farm. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll show you the ropes.  But you&#39;ll need a good night&#39;s sleep and lots of energy tomorrow. It is pretty physically demanding work. &quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly heard a voice downstairs.  &quot;Jess....Liz... is everything okay up there?  I heard a lot of shouting and door slamming. You girls aren&#39;t fighting again, are you?&quot; said his Mom.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth gathered up the components of the computer, and placed them in a large box. She easily lifted it and cradled it under one arm .  &quot;No, Mom.  We were just working on the computer, and it got a little messed up.  Everything&#39;s fine,  &quot; said Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but you girls need to get to bed.  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day, &quot; said his Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Jess?&quot; said Jeff softly, getting the feel of his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;s Jessica, but everyone just calls you Jess.  It&#39;s your nickname....kind of like how everyone calls me Liz.  Don&#39;t worry, as reality finishes adjusting, I think things will begin to make more sense.&quot; said Elizabeth.  &quot;She&#39;s right, thought, we do need to get to sleep.  But, I did leave a little present for you in your top drawer, just in case you decided to use the program. If you can&#39;t get to sleep, and you want to have some fun, you might want to check it out.  Sweet dreams, SISTER, &quot; said Elizabeth, as she closed the door and left him alone.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt exhausted and jittery at the same time.  It had been a long day, full of many tiring adventures with lots of unexpected developments... but he still felt the adrenaline rush from his last transformation.  And he was loathe to admit it, but he did think he looked pretty hot - for an anthro-horse girl, that is. Looking at his body in the mirror made him feel excited.  He didn&#39;t think he would go to sleep easily.  He was curious what present Elizabeth may have left him, so he walked over to his nightstand and opened the drawer to examine it.  With a shock, he pulled out a large plastic dildo, as long as his arm, and almost as thick.  <br />
<br />
Gross, he thought.  What does she think I want with this?  There&#39;s no way I would use it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
He quickly placed it back in the drawer, and shut it.  But, laying in bed, trying desperately to calm his mind and sleep, he found that his eyes kept drifting back to the drawer.</p>
