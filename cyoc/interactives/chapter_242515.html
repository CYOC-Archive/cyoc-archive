<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There she was lying on her back naked, wet and beautiful as ever with a radiant smile on her face. Her long blonde hair flowing down onto the floor as she props her torso up with her elbows. However her ears were now elfin and red and between her fingers was webbing was a similar red color. But the real change was from Alison’s waste down… <br />
<br />
Alison’s Legs were gone replaced by a very long and sleek mermaid tail. It is around 4 feet long with the fin being 2 1/2 feet wide. The are two smaller pectoral fins sticking out of her hips. It is incredibly thin near the end being barely around the width of one of her old legs making it clear there was no way this was a costume she could fit in. It was also flapping slightly on the floor only cementing the fact this was real. The whole thing was covered in tiny beautiful hot pink with bits of blood red here and there said red also being the color of her fins. These scales flawlessly blend into her torso making it look like it was always there.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t it Amazing?” Alison grinned.<br />
<br />
“What happened?” You asked shocked. You knew you caused this but you didn’t know if it would work. Plus you want to know how exactly this happened. <br />
<br />
“Well… I was just going about my evening ready to take a shower but my legs were starting to feel weak. I didn’t think anything of it but when I turned the shower my legs stopped working and I hit the floor with my back. Then they just started too… melt. They were stuck together and were melting down into each other. The scales started popping in my find bursted out and my legs sculpted themselves into this long thin tube and now…” Alison raises her fin up towards your face. Her adorable smile growing exponentially wider. “… I’m a Mermaid!”<br />
<br />
You sit down into the ground. You can’t stop staring at how beautiful Alison’s tail is. How beautiful she is. “I can’t believe it worked if…”<br />
<br />
“Wait… Did you have something to do with this?” <br />
<br />
“Well… I-I I… Yes… I did this… I made you a mermaid…” You tell her everything, the Transformation Genie, the Wish, how this is Permanent and how you just wanted her to be happy. Alison stares at you her face never changing: a Shocked Gasp. You can’t begin to think about what she is thinking. But before you can say anything she lunges towards you giving you a tight hug and a big wet kiss. “THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU!” She Screams. Alison starts to laugh and cry in your arms her tail uncontrollably slapping against the ground as if it were a dog wagging its tail. “You’re… You’re really okay with this? I mean I know you love mermaids but Alison… this is permanent… You Will Never Walk Again…” Alison calms down sighing sinking into your chest and your arms her long this tail calming down and curling up beside you. She then raises her voice a little bit: “You know me very well wouldn’t you say? Does it look like I care about walking?” She snuggles up into your chest again her tail slapping against the floor again only W A Y calmer. You gently rub her back and you just know this is the Woman you want to spend your life with. You had some doubts before all year on and off but now you know buying that ring was the right choice… you just got to wait to ask her…<br />
<br />
“Hey Honey?” You ask. “Yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Can I… Touch… It…”<br />
<br />
Alison looks up at you into your eyes. “Yes! Of course you can! But please be Careful… my scales are delicate and the whole thing is very sensitive. Plus I still got to rewire my head to forget legs and get used to this thing… It’s hard to control sometimes… Be Gentle.” <br />
<br />
 “Always…”<br />
<br />
Alison Smiles and shifts her position so she is leaning sideways into you instead of forwards. You take the hand you used for o rub her back and bring it up to her cheek. You give it a comforting squeeze and gently touch her red elf ears. You gently kiss her on the forehead as she coos joyfully. You then bring the hand down her cheek rubbing her neck as shoulders down to her bare breasts your fingers stray towards it. But you stop and move downward on past her breasts, her stomach and to her waist. Above it you feel her flesh but as you go to her hips you feel the smooth transition from skin to scales. They don’t feel anything like normal fish tails being very soft and hot. Alison wiggles her hips as her pectoral fins begin to flap. She giggles and her face begins to visibly redden. “Sorry… I can’t help it… It Tickles.” You keep that hand firmly gripped onto her scaled waist even as it wiggles and squirms beneath your touch. You gently caress the scales with your fingers. Alison further tightens her grip on you. You take her other Hand and begin to rub her tail gently. It begins to wiggle around beneath you’re hand. You are about to grab her wiggling fin but she stops you. “No! Wait! Don’t grab it! You have to rub it. It’s especially delicate. I’ll try to hold it down for you.” The Fins stops moving but you can firmly see it shake with anticipation. “If you want me to stop just let me know.” Her tomato red face nods. You place your hand onto of the vibrating fin gently touching it but also pinning it down. The entirety of Alison snakes as you do this. Her Hips wiggle, her Tail squirms and Her Arms Squeezes. It doesn’t feel that much different than a normal fish fin being very besides the year. Seeing Alison’s reaction to this you immediately let the fin go and instead use your free arm to hug her. You let you let your hip hand also free and return it to rubbing her back. Alison calms form and releases the breath that she was holding in. You gently hold your lovely mermaid on the bathroom floor both of you soaked and very tired you from the work that day and her from her melting legs and sensitive tail but your are both so happy….<br />
<br />
Finally she breaks the silence and asks the question… “Can you get me out of here? The floor is too hard for my tail and I’m wet and cold. I want to get out of here but I can’t move.” <br />
<br />
“Are you sure you can breathe without water?”<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll be fine but if I can’t I will let you know.”<br />
<br />
With that you stand up and remove yourself from Alison’s embrace. She is now lying on her stomach on the cold hard floor. You go off out of the room to go grab a towel. There Alison just sits thinking to herself “Now I know this should be a bad thing but my dream is now real and I have the best boyfriend ever so I will be okay! We’ll find a way to make life work. Plus I love it when he carries me.” You return to find her gently tapping the tiles with one hand her other holding her head up and her tail flapping gently on the ground. She smiles as she sees you with her tail fin slapping twice on the ground excitingly. By now it’s clear her tail fin doesn’t just move on her own accord but it can also move passively by stimuli and her own emotions. You pass her the towel and she flips onto her back and gets into a seating position. She then wraps the towel across her Christ hiding her decent chest. When she’s done she holds her hands out like a kid asking to be picked up. You walk over to her and crouch down. She wraps both arms around your neck and begins to coil her tail around your waist. You grab her by her own waist and place your other arm under her tail causing it wiggle again. You lift her up into the air and she sighs leaning her entire wait into you. “I love it when you carry me….” She purrs. “Well there is going to be so much more time in your life for that Honey. Now where do you want to go?</p>
