<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cameron waited for several minutes. As he sat patiently, his clothes began to feel umcomfortable; as if they were tightening across his chest. Cam shifted restlessly in the seat as his penis began to harden in his pants for no particular reason. Then, before he could even attempt to rid himself of his sexual tension, he noticed that the sun was beginning to peak over the top of the horizon. The sky changed within seconds from the cold blue to the calm orange of the morning. The uncomfortableness Cameron had felt seemed to fade away, along with his boner. The peacefulness dripped over his body, and he gradually fell into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Cameron woke up to the sound of traffic in the mid-morning bustle. Stretching outwards, Cam got up out of his seat and moved over to the window. A vague thought hammered through the slight hang over he was having...Something about two guys in Speedos...the balcony was empty, spare a few tatters of cloth that seemed to have been shredded apart. Shrugging, Cameron turned to the clock on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;9:48...Crap, I'm late!&quot; he thought to himself. Cameron considered waking up one of his buddies, but decided he had better just get back home before his wife killed him. Quick as he could, Cameron sprinted to the hotel's elevator, dashed through the lobby and dived into his car. The traffic kept him stationary for at least 10 minutes. As he waited at the rear of a long line of traffic, Cameron gazed wistfully out the window at the beach. He looked past the two young girls in bikinis, out towards the life guards doing their morning exercises in their tight, dark-green Speedos. They were all pretty buff and Cameron secretly admired the fact that they were so comfortable with themselves that they could actually wear a Speedo. Not him though; Cameron was always a little too self-aware to wear anything that revealing. Gradually, the traffic eased up and Cameron edged closer and closer to home.<br />
<br />
Cameron lived with a few mates in a house on the out skirts of the city. He figured that most of them would already be down at the constuction site at work; he'd have to make up something big to get out of trouble today.<br />
<br />
Cam reached his house at 10:30. Not sparing a second, he ran into the house and tore off the shirt and jeans he was wearing. Only clad in his blue boxer shorts, Cameron fumbled through his closet for his work clothes. After a few seconds of forraging, Cam triumphantly slid into his red singlet and blue short-shorts. Picking up speed again, Cameron fled back to the car and drove to the construction site. <br />
<br />
Smiling nervously, Cameron edged his way across the dusty site with the framework of a house jutting out the centre, making it look as if he had been there the entire time. One of his room mates spotted him and smiled knowingly. Cam smiled back and got about to work. He had evaded getting in any serious trouble, and as far as the fore man knew, he had been there all day.<br />
<br />
At 5:00 PM, the crew slowly began to shrink down as the workers left for home. Cameron still had an hour or so left of work which he had to complete before leaving the site, thanks to him waking up late. Finally, it was just Cameron hard at work, the fore man Pete who was busying himself with some paper work and Jim, one of Cameron's room mates who was waiting around for Cam to finish. Cam screwed another bolt into the wall and wiped his brow with the back of his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew...it's been a long day. I guess I can do this tomorrow...it's getting too dark to see properly,&quot; Cam reasoned with Jim. Jim smiled.<br />
&quot;So, you're saying that because you partied all last night, you are too buggered to even lift a finger?&quot; Jim joked.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess you could say that,&quot; Cameron responded with a laugh.<br />
&quot;I'll go say bye to Pete; you finish up in here,&quot; Jim said. Cameron nodded and quickly cleared up the area he was working in. The night was just barely setting in; the sun dipping back below the horizon as darkness descended. Peeling off the gloves he had on, Cam moved to the outside of the half built house. As he moved outside, the moon light had fully spread out, casting its yellow-white beams over his muscular body. Something clicked inside of Cam; something that froze him in his tracks. It started in his foot where he had been bitten the previous night, but it quickly spread throughout his body.<br />
<br />
Cameron began to shake slightly; sweat beads forming across his forehead. Cam's eyes locked on the large moon hovering lazily in the sky in front of him. Within an instant, Cam's clothes tightened until they felt like a second skin; or rather, his muscles and chest were growing larger and pushing his clothes apart. Gasping for breath, Cameron dropped his gloves to the dusty ground, and he began to itch his chest. As he scratched wildly at his quickly forming abs, the irritating sensation seemed to fade, along with it the thick curly chest hair Cam had grown over the years. The slight day old fuzz that had spread over his chin followed suit, leaving Cam's face smooth and handsome, despite the pain he felt tearing across his body. As the itching sensation faded from his chest and face, it moved down to his crotch. Rubbing like mad, Cameron's penis felt like it was being worn raw as his pubic hair sunk into his crotch, and with the exception of the thickening wavy brown hair on his head, he was smooth and hairless.<br />
<br />
A thought processed through Cam's mind: &quot;Call for help!!!&quot;; but another urge quickly was taking precedence over this though...a raw, animal instinct-like urge was forming slowly, and before he could stop himself, Cameron tilted his head up to the moon and gave a long, wolf-like howl into the night. He kicked his boots across the site, tossing his socks with them. Next, Cam clawed crazily at the sweaty red singlet sticking tightly to his massive chest. He managed to grip the thin material pressing against his shoulders, and tore it apart, freeing his bronzed abs from its fabric prison and letting the red singlet's remains slip to the dirt below. Cameron paused as his common sense briefly retook its position. His arms were a lot larger than they should have been; bulging at all angles with muscle...the animal instincts of the Speedo Fag reclaimed its grasp over Cameron's mind. He stared at his shorts...he desperately want them off, but he knew he wouldn't even need to touch them to get rid of them...A rip from behind signaled that his shorts had widened to accomodate his muscular ass. The buttons he had on the front of his shorts sprang off as his boner eased itself outwards. The muscles quickly took advantage of the loosening shorts and tightened them once more. With one final rip the shorts split down the sides, bursting the material onto the ground. Much like he had been earlier this morning, Cameron stood clad only in his blue boxer shorts. But he still wasn't ready yet...<br />
<br />
Cameron's boner pushed towards the opening in his boxer shorts, but before it could pop through, the silky material had sealed itself across, trapping his moaning penis beneath the smooth material. The boxer short's legs crept up his thighs until they had nestled tightly around his ass and crotch. The blue gradually changed from a dark blue to a light purple to a brilliant red; the Speedo symbol shimmering onto the now spandex fabric. Cameron's lust for men rushed through his mind, taking over his last human instincts. Joyfully, Cameron howled into the night once more.</p>
