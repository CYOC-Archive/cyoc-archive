<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With her wand in hand, it took but a twinkling touch to the forehead of Eric, and he was on his way into a new form, a new realm, and likely wishing he had never met Circe.<br />
<br />
The sudden smell of scorched skin became profound then in the air.<br />
<br />
Eric winced feeling the wand touch his forehead, he seeing Circe speak in soft tones the chanting spell that would make him as one of her own.<br />
<br />
Spiraling sensations welled out from the place where the wand did touch.<br />
<br />
Eric stood stiffly frozen by the spell, he could not run or fight for his human existence, but had to stand there a feel his link to humanity fade away.<br />
<br />
Gradually his nose bloomed, as nostrils and an upper lip merged, swelled, and blended with his lower lip to make a muzzle. The sensation seemed oddly pleasurable to Eric, he felt not fear but an anxious desire to become as an animal and be free from all that was as is as a human.<br />
<br />
Eyes swelled within still human eye sockets, as then from his skull came creaking sounds of bone growth.<br />
<br />
Eric winced again when the nasty sound of his skull growing seemed to block out all other sounds around him. A shivering sensation added to his anxiety at that moment, muscles changing from the very fiber that they were made, becoming wholly animalistic.<br />
<br />
Tickling sensations in his ears were all he had to make him realize his ears were growing, as earlobes developed into large oval and furry shapes.<br />
<br />
Slowly as with all of his senses under attack from the massive changes, Eric felt something tying a knot in his throat. He wanted to speak, to ask, to scream from the strange feeling. His throat burst with massive new muscular strength, well able to help him hold up his soon to be enormous bovine head. <br />
<br />
The tortured sensation worked its way down his throat and spread its effects to a set of bellies, and oddly to his internal organs making a man a bull. <br />
<br />
Those funny feeling shivers helped along the change of human skin to a thick and well able to deal with the weather; turning black, tougher, thicker, and made to be the skin of a bull.<br />
<br />
Prickly sensations flew over his hide like waves of air passing through tall stalk of wheat. What was on Eric a spreading cloak of thick bovine black fur felt nice, offering him a sense of personal comfort he never had when being as a man.<br />
<br />
Skin as hide, and peach fuzz made into a thick coat of black fur, the toughening of body muscles added to the stiffened stance of one born with the name of Eric.<br />
<br />
Circe smiled seeing how well her magical powers could dehumanize a man into being bestial of form.<br />
<br />
The puckering lump on the tightly muscled belly of her Minotaur was the growing bovine sheath. Circe always added a little of her power and erotic delight, giving the sheath of her animals a slight prod with the end of her wand.<br />
<br />
Eric jerked from the touch of the wand to his expanding bovine sheath. <br />
<br />
The spark of power added to the growing new organ the power to increase it in sensuality, it gaining in length and girth from the where it peeked from the sheath to the slightly domed end.<br />
<br />
The sudden erection of his then fully formed bovine bull shaft made Eric peer down and try to give a bovine lipped sort of smile.<br />
<br />
He saw his hot red new shaft, feeling the wanton pangs of what a bull does when the scent and time is ever so righteous. It wiggled, straining to be at full length and had on the end of its shaft a funny mushroom dome.<br />
<br />
Circe leans close to her developing Minotaur, saying to Eric, &quot;The length will help to thrill you, but the tip is especially sensual; it helps draw from the ovaries eggs, using a sucking wave action. Whether human female or some brute of a cow, your shaft will make a female swoon and beg for more, more, and much, much more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric was feeling enthused, he swooning for the first chance to use his new shaft, he felt then the wave of change do him his biggest injustice.<br />
<br />
As human testicles did swell, get fur covered and hung then in a long loose sack to bump at his bovine shaped hock, he felt the epedemy of what is being like an animal, his tail began to grow.<br />
<br />
Anxiety built to exceedingly high levels as each new link of bone in his growing tail did mature and pop into place. The growing of it held Eric in a near trance, unable to turn his head and see the growth happen, he closed his eyes and tried to visualize the thing in his mind's eye.<br />
<br />
Pressing and growing, the bovine bull sized tail did more and caused major affects to his rump.<br />
<br />
As what on a human never sees the suns warm rays, the flat rump on Erin was like those granted to all bovines. The sensation of tail movements over the ticklish folds of his then bovine anus made Eric excited, wishing as much the change would continue and make of him a beauty of one big bull.  <br />
<br />
Changes did move along in the direction to nearly make of Eric be a bull. His human legs did accept the changing manner of stance ans bones shifted and muscles swelled with added strength.<br />
<br />
The dull sensation of toes becoming cloven hooves was but the easy part of his gaining hoofs. He felt his fingers begin to stiffen, they melding together, soon as each a cloven hoof with a human thumb.<br />
<br />
A black big Minotaur then stood sporting a massive big bullish erection. As he stood still stiff in more ways than one, Circe took her wand once more, she trailing the thing up and down along the length of the male erect member Eric had as his one great delight.<br />
<br />
The raking of the wand along the stiff male member had the testicles sending forth long spurts and trailing strings of silky juices.<br />
<br />
Eric bellowed forth a sound as of a bull feeling the call to rut. He eyed toward the peering young handmaiden, she staying far enough away from the Minotaur to stay safe from his infectious sperm.<br />
<br />
Circe continued her milking out the remaining semen from those bullish big balls. <br />
<br />
Smiling at her Minotaur, Circe informed Eric, &quot;As the semen comes and drains out the testicles, your male organs shall replace the semen with true bovine sperm; infectious to both human and animal, as well to females and as such men too! Whether you mate or let some lusty individual suck you to climax, what came as human and thereafter knew the touch of your semen will join you as part of a growing herd.&quot;</p>
