<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly smiled as she cuddled up to Molly with their first bout of love making as Animalians. She was glad to see that her long time love had regained her strength and capacity to be who she was before the mob decided to break Molly&#39;s legs. It also provided something of a rebirth for both of them and a new shot that Animalia had offered a lot of people. It made Shelly smile as her thoughts drifted back to her own conversion...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure she&#39;ll be okay?&quot; Shelly looked over to Doctor Stein as he came out of the changing room that he&#39;d let Molly into.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke as he put the used syringes back into a medical waste box that one of the nurses had also brought out. Shelly also noted that the nurse also handed Doctor Stein the other syringe box that would carry Shelly&#39;s doses of the vaccine. &quot;She should heal fine, though with regard to her, the biggest thing will be making sure to wait until after the tranquilizer wears off and she gets her feet back under her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shelly slowly nodded as things that developed in that way. Becoming an Animalian had been more of an issue for rebirth for Shelly in that she&#39;d wanted her lover to be able to get started again and in a situation where she wouldn&#39;t be as vulnerable as she was. Shelly would then happily go along for the ride, though she had her choice more on the Siberian Tiger rather than being another Polar Bear or even some other species of Bear. And some of her own reading had found that Siberian Tigers did periodically hunt and eat bears, which she felt would then put her on par with Molly when her transformation was finished. It also raised some other points of curiosity on Shelly&#39;s part on what they&#39;d do after both of them became Animalians. A part of her even wondered a bit if they would end up meeting the Dinotopian named Molly, since both of them would share the same first name.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein then lead Shelly to the next room that was built like the room Molly was in, but didn&#39;t have some of the added equipment that had been needed to assure that Molly slept through the transformation. Shelly moved to sit down on the bed and hesitantly removed her shirt  while Doctor Stein readied the syringes for the shots. She sat calmly by as Doctor Stein then wiped her shoulder with an alcohol swab and then delivered the shots with the customary &quot;welcome to Animalia.&quot; After that point, Doctor Stein then left the room and Shelly could hear the door click shut, though at the same time she was more focused on the growing warmth that came with the transformation. In fact, Shelly turned to look down to see a rusty faded orange coat of fur begin to grow in, along with black strikes coming in. It was a bit different from most of the other Tiger Animalians, but then most of them were based off of the Bengal Tiger, which lived in a more southern climate and had a darker shade of orange for their fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll be stronger than them to!&quot; Shelly mused to herself as she stood up and moved to strip down from the rest of her clothes.<br />
<br />
It made good sense, as Shelly also began feeling various articles of her clothing begin to grow tight around her. Tigers were relatively large animals in general and the Siberian was the biggest Tiger of all and Shelly could watch as her muscle mass grew and rejuvenated itself in rapid succession. It then began growing bigger as white fur began to grow down her belly with the black stripes wrapping around her sides. Shelly smiled and moved to look herself over, even as her feet began to lengthen into more digitigrade feet. There was no pain, even with the sort of crackling noise and tingle that went through her feet and even her face. That rising tingle brought her hands to her face, and she felt it pushing forward into the large rounded muzzle common to all big cats, and as she ran her tongue over her teeth, she could also feel the long canines designed to hold prey and the sharpened molars designed to cut meat. She also noted the claws that now poked out from her finger tips. She continued to feel around and found that fur on her head had grown in thick, and by the time she found her ears, they were now halfway up her head and had changed shape. They were still rounded in a way, but pointed more upward than out to a side the way her human ears had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Shelly managed and noted that her voice sounded a bit deeper now. It was still feminine but carrying a deeper tone, probably related to the alterations that probably occurred with her voice box to allow her to roar if need be.<br />
<br />
The line was then interrupted as her breasts now began to feel painfully cramped inside her bra. Between her growing muscles and her growing breasts, the bra that had been built for her human form was rapidly became too small. At the same time as her fur thickened, the bra&#39;s smaller size at points seemed to hold her fur in place and pulled on her fur. That was enough to get her frustrated to where with one hand she slipped a thumb through the outer side of her panties with one hand and then gripped at the front of her bra with the other hand. Firm pulls served to tear the fabric with a long rip, with proved to let her now much larger breasts bounce freely and gave her room for her growing tail to bloom out behind her.  Shelly immediately began testing the new appendage and continued to look herself over.<br />
<br />
She found that while her fur had not grown to the winter length the Siberian Tiger, but it was longer than the summer coat in other Tiger Animalians. Though, this also made sense in that the other surviving subspecies of Tigers lived in largely tropical environments and wouldn&#39;t need thick winter coats. She then made her way to the door and tapped on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; Shelly called, &quot;is Molly up yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; came the response from the other side, which was Doctor Stein&#39;s voice, &quot;though I&#39;d think that by now her transformation should be completed, so it shouldn&#39;t be long before her new metabolism burns through the anesthesia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see her?&quot; Shelly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... though would you like clothes?&quot; Doctor Stein replied through the door, &quot;While most of Tiger Animalians are Bengal Tigers, they are all too big for Human sized clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ultimately I will need new clothes,&quot; Shelly responded, &quot;but I do have something special planned for Molly when she gets up... so maybe just a dressing gown.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So what were you thinking on?&quot; Molly&#39;s voice shook Shelly out of her thoughts and she came back into the present, laying beside the beautiful Polar Bear Animalian she loved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... just back on my transformation,&quot; Shelly answered with a smile and rubbed her muzzle to Molly&#39;s, chuffing as she did so, &quot;getting myself ready for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you were amazing,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;though we may need to soon focus on how to plan out a wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shelly only smiled.</p>
