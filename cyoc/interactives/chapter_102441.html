<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Eric holding both backpacks, Spencer led him by her good arm upstairs to her room.<br />
Once they were in there alone, she quickly closed the door, pinned her boyfriend against it, and started kissing him.<br />
Eric returned every smooch, as human lips met her furry muzzle.<br />
&quot;Oh Eric,&quot; moaned Spencer between kisses. &quot;When you&#39;re a were, I&#39;m gonna seriously ravish you!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it!&quot; he replied, while massaging Spencer&#39;s breasts through the over sized sweatshirt she was wearing.<br />
Spencer moaned again, louder this time, before she said, &quot;Honey. We&#39;ve got to stop. Not only before we go too far, but before my grandpa comes up here wondering what we&#39;re up to.&quot;<br />
&quot;damn,&quot; Eric muttered under his breath, reluctantly breaking away from her.<br />
&quot;I know dear,&quot; said Spencer, licking her lips while straightening her appearance. &quot;So, tell me what you know about this Kenya Adaeze,&quot; she requested, while sitting on the edge of her bed.<br />
<br />
While his information was only from dinner conversation, Eric did as he sat beside his girlfriend. &quot;So, could she be the one?&quot; he asked afterward.<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; was Spencer&#39;s only comment. &quot;While other weres make that decision as a conscious choice; the problem with some feline based weres is that their sexual tendencies are not only fixed, but transferable too. For some reason, werecheetahs only have one gender, female, and are automatically bi or gay. Domestic based werecats come in both genders, but are also either bi or gay by nature. While my mom favors the panthress when she transforms, because there&#39;s werecat in her family tree too, she&#39;s also bi. We know this Kenya is a panthress too, but there&#39;s also some leopard in her family tree, because of what you said she said about the light spot pattern of her fur. While neither species is known for same gender tendencies, the big questions that need to be answered for our purposes are discovering whether or not there&#39;s any werecat in her family heritage to help us confirm whether she just dabbles in females from time to time, or is outright bi.&quot;<br />
&quot;And if she is bi, then we&#39;re right back where we are at the moment because being a natural hybrid were, you don&#39;t want to take the risk of passing the werecat&#39;s sexual preferences on to me, regardless of whether I&#39;d become lupine or feline if I had sex with you,&quot; realized Eric.<br />
&quot;Afraid so. I love you too much as is to risk such a drastic personality change, regardless of the source,&quot; admitted Spencer, before giving Eric a quick kiss.<br />
&quot;But what if Kenya just dabbles and is not only suitable, but agrees to help us?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;Regardless of who the female were that helps us turns out to be, I have that all figured out.&quot;<br />
&quot;You do?&quot; asked a surprised Eric.<br />
&quot;Yes darling,&quot; said Spencer, putting the arm that wasn&#39;t in a sling around him. We&#39;ll find a nice, quiet place for just the three of us. You will enjoy her cream and, as your first transformation starts, I will be more than willing to cure you of your virginity my love,&quot; said Spencer, as she started kissing Eric again. &quot;Afterward, you have sex with the other female were to be complete; then the three of us enjoy our time together.&quot;<br />
&quot;So I not only lose my virginity and become a were, I also experience my first threesome in the process too?&quot; asked Eric with a smile on his face. &quot;You&#39;re willing and okay with that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, as long as you can accept that I&#39;m a little bi myself,&quot; said Spencer, staring at Eric to see what his reaction would be.<br />
&quot;If I love you, and I do, then I have to accept and love <i>every</i> aspect of you, including that,&quot; he said, kissing her again. &quot;But a threesome so soon?&quot;<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what it takes to be together, but I see you&#39;re really warming up to the possibility,&quot; added Spencer, reaching down with her good arm to feel the bulging penis trapped in Eric&#39;s pants.<br />
&quot;Considering my parents activities even before they became weres, I guess I have more of my dad&#39;s interests in sex in me than I realized,&quot; replied Eric, as he started nuzzling Spencer&#39;s neck.<br />
&quot;Let me help you with that,&quot; purred Spencer, as she undid Eric&#39;s pants. Then she got off the bed and laid between his legs to orally pleasure his cock while Eric massaged her ears, which he was surprised to discover to be an erogenous zone for Spencer, as the mixed species couple wound up having a mutual orgasm together.<br />
<br />
UNKNOWN TO SPENCER AND ERIC...<br />
Wanting to learn more about her new beau, Grandpa had secretly ascended the staircase until he was in a position to overhear their conversation with his acute werewolf ears.<br />
<i>Poor kids. Kind of like &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, but I&#39;ve always hated how that ends,</i> he thought, listening to his granddaughter and her boyfriend try to work out how to have a future together. <i>They really love each other, but until Eric becomes a were...</i><br />
As he heard the telltale sound of a zipper being undone, Mike Lawson silently crept back downstairs. <i>Too bad I don&#39;t have any contacts around here to help them. The first name of that werepanthress I met as part of the &quot;entertainment&quot; at my buddy&#39;s retirement party started with a K too, but I never caught Kendra&#39;s last name. Maybe one of my friends remembers how to get in touch with the &quot;caterer&quot;. I&#39;ll have to ask the next time I see them.</i><br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Not that I&#39;m trying to talk you out of this Frances, but why are you suddenly wanting to taste a cock?&quot; asked William Anderson, as both his werefoxhood and Evan Lawson&#39;s werewolf penis twitched in eager anticipation.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she purred, licking her lips and twitching her werecat nose, &quot;since we&#39;ve started partying together, Samantha and I have gotten used to your leftovers in Martha, and now we&#39;ve expanded our horizons with yours as well as Evan&#39;s leftovers in Maggie; but I&#39;ve started wondering what your... output tastes like fresh, directly from the source.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s called semen, Frances,&quot; said Evan, as a quick glance at his wife encouraged him to go on with the <i>experiment</i>, while she and Martha Anderson started rubbing each other&#39;s were cunts while looking at the show before them to start the Thanksgiving night orgy within the Anderson family&#39;s basement.<br />
&quot;Semen. Right. Thanks Evan,&quot; said Frances, while looking up at him from her kneeling position. &quot;Now, I want you gentlemen to remember. Just because I&#39;m doing this now, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll ever do it again, let alone that it will ever lead to further activity between us, but let&#39;s enjoy the moment as it is and let the future take care of itself later. So, to be fair, I think I should try both for scientific comparison, but who should go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
_______________________________________________________________<br />
AFTERWARD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES<br />
The Moon Lake of Earth-2 is vastly different than that of Earths 1 or 3, whose timelines deviate at the point where William Anderson had his dramatic confrontation with the rogue werevixen Yvette Smith.<br />
On Earth-2, Eric Anderson is not quite as timid when it comes to females, as seen by events in Spencer&#39;s bedroom this episode; and while Samantha and Frances Twist are still an otherwise dedicated and happily married lesbian werecat couple, this world&#39;s Frances is apparently a bit more open to &quot;scientific&quot; discovery. Whether her experiment is just a one time thing or Frances eventually decides to become more bi in regards to sex with men is unknown at this time. But whatever happens, love and marriage will always be with just her mate Samantha, whose&#39;s beside herself right now watching Frances about to taste her first penis(es).<br />
Meanwhile, unknown to Grandpa Lawson, Kenya Adaeze and the high priced escort Kendra (Smythe) are the same werepanthress, but other than her &quot;catering&quot; employer, the only other person who knows this is her boyfriend, Nate Anderson!—tmw.</p>
