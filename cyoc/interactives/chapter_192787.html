<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve was 17 and the last job he had was at a Halloween store. After the holiday they were downsizing and he was without work by November 3rd. He had been scouring the local area and needed something soon so he could make his car, car insurance, cell phone payments, not to mention gas and fun money needs...<br />
<br />
Dan was vague about the details but said it was at the local mall and offered $25/hour, was part time, seasonal, and temporary... but with cash like that he would not only be able to scrape by but be able to get people Christmas gifts this year!<br />
<br />
Steve called the number and set up an interview later that day. That alone was exciting after how many times he was blown off.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the mall he found the main office after some searching and soon was in an office with a severe looking middle aged man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, my name is Steve. I appreciate you taking the time to interview me.&quot; Steve extended his hand.<br />
<br />
The man smiled and even that felt like the man was sizing Steve up. &quot;Yes, sit, I&#39;m Dan Wright and I manage the mall&#39;s community engagement efforts in addition to other things. Do you know what you are applying for?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, no.&quot; Steve answered. &quot;My friend gave me the number to call and some details but didn&#39;t say what it was about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, I see. Well, you are applying for the position of Mall Santa. Between now and December 24th, you would be able to work up to 40 hours a week with a minimum requirement of 12 hours. You would have to wear a suit of course and simply use a timecard to track your coming and goings. Duties would include maintaining appearances, acting the part, and taking pictures with guests as requested. There will be two mandatory 4 hour &#39;Sit with Santa&#39; events the two Saturdays before Christmas. Are you still interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can make sure my family knows not to plan anything with me those days and I can choose my own hours?&quot; Steve asked essentially hearing that he found his dream job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, err, you are at least 18 aren&#39;t you?&quot; Mr. Wright asked with narrowing eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;17 and a quarter sir...&quot; Steve smiled nervously thinking he just lost the job...<br />
<br />
Mr. Wright smiled. &quot;Not to worry, you just need a parent or guardian to provide consent for the employment contract and we will give you a try. Come back later today or tomorrow with their signature and we can get you started immediately. One detail of note, maximum of 20 hours until after Thanksgiving, then you can work up to 40 hours... many people are touchy about Christmas coming on too strong too soon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Thank you Sir!&quot; Steve was overjoyed.<br />
<br />
Returning home Steve shared the news and after his parents briefly looked over the contract they signed. Having already missed a week of work Steve was happy to go back and get some hours in, especially since it was over double his previous pay rate.<br />
<br />
Returning to the mall, Steve was directed to wait in the chairs outside Mr. Wright&#39;s office as he was with another employee. The door was open and what Steve made out of the conversation was confusing but animated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Martinez, If you&#39;ll just sit down I can explain in full.&quot; Mr. Wright said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t sit down, I quit!&quot; another man said. before spilling into a string of Spanish.<br />
<br />
A moment later a man exited Mr. Wright&#39;s office, he was Hispanic, sported a heavily graying beard with salt and pepper hair, and was heavy set. He looked like a fantastic candidate to make a mall Santa in build, but he looked spooked out and didn&#39;t notice you as he passed but was mumbling to himself... all you could pick out were the words Diablo, Santo/a, along with Christo and Maria... <br />
<br />
&quot;We could potentially transition you, pending a replacement! Would you like to be an elf?&quot; Mr. Wright called pleadingly...<br />
<br />
Mr. Wright looked very defeated until you showed up, which made him visibly perk up. &quot;Ah! Steven! Delighted to see you again, your timing is impeccable if slightly early.&quot; Mr. Wright called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Steve.&quot; he corrected. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Steve. I trust you have returned with parental consent?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have!&quot; Steve gestured at the man who just left. &quot;What was his deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He decided to break contract with us for personal reasons. I loved his work so much I even tried to find him another position but...&quot; Mr. Wright looked sad and shook his head. on his desk a piece of paper was ripped in two. &quot;It&#39;s so disappointing because he was really coming into the role nicely and we were proud to have representation beyond the traditional fat white man aesthetic. Everyone here was a fan of his work. We all love the big guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t clear to Steve if he was still talking about the actor who just left or Santa as a general concept but the fact that the man&#39;s issues were not due to poor treatment by the Mall was a good sign. &quot;I just want to confirm a few things before I sign myself.&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
Steve clarified the pay rate was as advertised and Mr. Wright now advertised an immediate $500 sign on bonus. Steve also confirmed the hour minimum and maximum. Mr. Wright explained that due to an unforeseen opening in the other shift, unless otherwise informed Steve can work up to 40 hours a week, and after Thanksgiving, can work as many hours as he&#39;d like. Steve then clarified that he would get overtime after 40 hours a week which was confirmed, which then ended his questioning.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll sign on and start now if that&#39;s all right.&quot; Steve said pulling the folded contract from his contract.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent Steve, we are very excited for Santa to join us and we do hope you will be a good fit... As you sign I want to make sure that you understand that Fey Inc. will do all it can too assist you in attaining the appearance and having an attitude like Santa, AKA Santa J. Clause, AKA St. Nick, ad nauseum. Nullification of this contract by Fey Inc. would result in the removal of any affects or effects to aid you to embody the one known as Santa and cancellation by you or due to failure in meeting the minimum work hour expectations shall have no such effect. And finally, upon completion of your contract on Christmas Eve Fey Inc. will grant you a Christmas wish for overnight redemption. These terms are all laid out in your contract and agreement to them is noted by your signature here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was surprised to hear about the additional 500 dollars and Mr. Wright quickly found the page, sure enough, the contract had an urgent employment clause offering a bonus should no Santa position be currently filled after the 10th of November of a given year. Mr. Wright then pointed to where to sign the contract and Steve signed without hesitation understanding that he gets a sign on and severance bonus or maybe they meant Christmas gift, either way!</p>
