<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Denise Proudhoof was giddy with excitement as she strolled through the hospital in which her office/lab resided. Using the magic the runes on her arm and legs provided, she made her self appear human to the few hospital staff present. She was awoken from her fitful slumber an hour ago when Michael stirred and started to cook up some breakfast. The smell of thick cuts of ham frying on a skillet and a bowl of fresh cut fruit and hot coffee was just too enticing to not try and sleep through. She ate breakfast with gusto but did question Michael why he was up so early. He wanted to get a jump on prepping his restaurant and ensure his staff would become furries well before lunch service began. Denise pondered this and wondered if there could be a more effective way to spread this gift in a quicker fashion then close contact transfer or via contaminated foods.<br />
<br />
Hence why she was at her lab so early in the day. With her orange and black striped tail thrashing wildly as she roamed the nearly deserted ward of the hospital; the anthro tigress furry had to forcefully restrain herself from pouncing on the various nurses and orderlies she crosses paths with. Instead she made a mad dash for her office door and quickly shut it behind her. Sighing as her runes glow, sealing her office door until she was ready to leave, she began with earnest.<br />
“First I need a sample of what made me what I am now,” Denise musing as she draws a sample of her own blood. Putting a small sample under a microscope she jars the nearby computer out of sleep mode and uses the requisite program to see what she was working with.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Sometime later Denise rumbles with pleasure as she absently strokes her now furry entrance while using various medical equipment meant to separate blood plasma to help isolate and identify various diseases that can be lethal to humans. She pauses her self-pleasure for a moment as she needed both of her hand paws to put a tray of petri-dishes into an incubator to help type and identify the virus. She absently licks her paw clean and finds the taste of her vaginal fluids very pleasant.<br />
“Focus Denise,” She mutters as she focuses on the task; “there will be time for self-gratification and more carnal act of pleasure later.”<br />
<br />
Yet she was restless; like identifying the latest strain of Covid, processing her samples will take time. Time she has plenty of, as she begins to finger herself once again. Getting up, she pads to the nearby sofa in her office and starts to pleasure herself. Clawed furry digits probing and stimulating her feline snatch while the other hand paw was fondling a furry breast; tugging and pinching a nipple as she breathes heavily. Panting as her arousal builds, she roars with pleasure as the wave of orgasmic pleasure explodes across her body, causing her to shudder in bliss, as her breasts squirt out milk while her thighs get soaked with her vaginal discharge. She opened her eyes as the wave of pleasure finally ebbed and she could catch her breath. Getting up on shaky legs she head backs to the lab; not bothering to clean herself up as she notices the incubator has finished its task. Pulling out the tray of petri dishes, she takes one and examines it under the microscope. Denise smiles through her muzzle as she believes she found a way to make the furry virus as she’s coined it more effective in infecting and spreading.<br />
“I just need to test it,” Denise gathering the petri dishes.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Denise Proudhoof could not risk using the hospital as a means to test her theory. Too many random variables and a vast amount of people who could evade infection and report seeing humans turn into horny furries. So the doctor headed to one of the places she was assigned to monitor. If it wasn’t for the recent Covid pandemic, she wouldn’t have been assigned to this small town on the west coast of America. But her she was sent after politicians in Washington bickered over what to do in case another wave forced another state of emergency. Past physicians deduced that those with compromised and weakened immune systems were most at risk of dying from the rapidly mutating virus disrupting the world. Hence why she was standing in front of a hospice care facility. Thanks to her CDC credentials, she had full access to the facility much to the displeasure of those that run it. Thinking her presence is unnecessary, most of the staff despised her presence as she had the authority to shut them down. This facility like many other that handle patients at the end stage of their life/illness tend to operate on thin margins. A shut down would put them out of business for good; jobs gone.<br />
<br />
Denise sighed as she knew as a doctor, she was facing an ethical dilemma. Purposely unleashing a virus not only violates her Hippocratic oath, it is also an act of bio-terrorism. Yet she is now a furry and the urge to spread and infect humans is as instinctive as reproducing. So she decided that the best way for her to do this to not let the staff see she was on the premises. With a thought the runes on her glow as she made herself invisible and snuck in through the front entrance. Denise passed by the receptionist/security guard and made her way to the nearby stairwell that provides access to the roof. She was after the ventilation units located on the roof. She theorized that if the virus was airborne its ability to infect mass amounts of humans would be a far effective method. Making her way to the nearest roof top unit she opened up the access panel and used the aerosol spray she created to blow the virus into the ventilation system. She repeated the process with the other units before returning back inside after discharging the entire contents of canister she was carrying.<br />
<br />
Minutes later Denise watched as the hospice staff started to tear off their clothes and began to make out with each other in a furious passion of unbridled lust. Several were already in mid transformation as she walked by. Letting her invisibly spell fade as she smiled as the various newly formed furries climaxed once their transformations finished. Noticing that several furries were avian instead of mammalian; Denise also noted a couple that looked reptilian. <br />
&quot;Nature does love diversity,&quot; Denise mused. Noting the time it took for the virus to take effect she was about to leave when she noticed the nearby nursing station showing several code blue alerts from all the patient rooms currently occupied.<br />
“I guess the virus has it limits,” Denise looking at the patient charts tied to those rooms. Noting that they were old and suffering from terminal illnesses. Her thoughts were interrupted when a gecko furry approached her and silenced the alarms.<br />
“Can I help you, the now cloth-less nurse speaking; Do you have authorization to be here?”<br />
“I’m Dr. Denise Proudhoof of the CDC,” the Anthro Tiger answering; “these patients were they all ill?”<br />
“Yes doctor,” The nurse gathering the charts; “Cancer, organ failure, stroke, dementia, they only had days. Weeks at most,” The gecko furry answering; “some had covid and by the grace of some miricale, survived it. Why do you ask?”<br />
“I’m trying to determine the best way to increase the efficacy of the furry virus. But it seems that the virus has stressed out the sick and immune-comprimised patients to the point that their bodies gave out.” Dr. Denise answering as she further examined the gecko before her. &quot;Tell me are you feeling alright?”<br />
“I feel great,” the nurse answering; “as energetic as I did when I was twenty.” The nurse placing a scaly hand on her belly before adding; “I think my menopause has reversed. Did my youth get restored?”<br />
“Interesting,” Denise musing; “I can’t answer that with more data, but this initial test does show promise.”<br />
“Is there anything I can do to help,” The anthro gecko asking; the urge and desire to spread the virus pervading her thoughts, as other staff begin to gather their wits and approach.<br />
“Yes,” the anthro tiger smiling; “spread this gift to any family and friends you have here in town. Pass that on to the rest of the staff who are in the throes of passion. I have another location to test,” Denise happily skipping out of the hospice center thinking that the nearby rec-center would make an excellent second test site to test her airborne version of the furry virus.</p>
