<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Just a different version of the same change</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Y-you can’t treat me like this!” Jeff shouted. “I’m not some dumb fucking dog!”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters opened his mouth to respond when the machine beeped.<br />
<br />
There was a click and whir from the machine, along with a steadily building hum as something inside of it powered up. Jeff waited with baited breath, wondering what the machine would do. Even Mr. Walters was eyeing the machine, a slight frown on his face. Had his Principal wanted him to get defaulted?!<br />
<br />
“Species selected!’ A cheery voice pinged from the machine. “Fucking. Dog.”<br />
<br />
Jeff screamed in terror. How could this be possible? It was only supposed to select occupations!<br />
<br />
“New stats:…” The machine continued. “Horny, German Shepherd, Dumb, Police Dog.”<br />
<br />
“Ouch!” Mr. Walters laughed. “ It takes things like occupation and description very seriously. Shoulda just kept quiet and defaulted. You’d have at least been human, pal. Have a nice molding.”<br />
<br />
“Wait! Let me go! I can miss the bus, I don’t wanna be a dog!” Jeff pleaded as Mr. Walters made his way to the door.<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters paused.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s hopes rose. Maybe Mr. Walters wasn’t a complete monster after all? No one could be that cruel!<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Mr. Walters turned and Jeff’s hope quickly sank when he saw the grin on his face. “But as it turns out, you are just some dumb fucking dog!”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters was still laughing as he left the room.  <br />
<br />
Jeff heard the door lock. His heart pounded in terror as he heard the humming noise within the machine begin to build, the barrel of what looked like a laser attached to a robotic arm on the machine swiveling and pointing at his head.<br />
<br />
Jeff struggled in the restraints. They were only Velcro, but they were surprisingly tight and difficult to escape from. He tugged and tugged, hearing the machine above him powering up. Across the room was a sink with a metal paper towel dispense. He could see the machine’s LED display in the reflection and saw it counting down. <br />
<br />
59…58…57…<br />
<br />
He cursed and tugged harder. Jeff shot a quick glance at the countdown, noticing the humming grow louder. 49…48…47...He yanked and yanked and heard something give. The Velcro strap felt much looser now. Jeff checked and noticed the plastic ‘eye’ the Velcro had been threaded to had deformed, the plastic stretching. He clenched his teeth and pulled his arm. With a snap, the Velcro cuff came loose.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly reached over to his other arm and undid the strap. He got to his feet and went to the door. Locked. He glanced at the LED. 14…13…12…Shit! No time.<br />
<br />
He looked around frantically for someplace to hide. The room was mostly empty save for the machine with the laser barrel, which was still targeting him in spite of his escape. Maybe rip off the metal towel dispenser, deflect the laser? No, that wouldn’t work, it was screwed to the wall.<br />
<br />
The humming was building to a crescendo. Jeff’s eyes fell on the one thing in the room big enough for him to hide behind…..the chair he’d been strapped to!<br />
<br />
3..2…1…<br />
<br />
Jeff dove behind the chair just as the beam fired. It was red and warm where it caught the top of his head. Jeff knelt close behind the chair, pressing himself to it so the beam had no target. The tingling receded the moment he was out of the beam’s sight. With a shaking hand, he reached up and found his hair thicker and softer at the top of his head where the beam hit him.<br />
<br />
Thinking it still had him targeted, the beam hit the chair and the leather started growing warm, warping as the transformative ray did its work.<br />
<br />
Fur sprouted across the leather, the shape, the headrest bending forward, Triangular ears sprouting from it and a snout warping into existence. It began to shrink, forcing Jeff to crouch lower and lower as the four legs of the chair became the four legs of a large German Shepherd dog.<br />
<br />
Jeff cursed his luck as the chair changed. Out of all the things, why dog? He couldn’t even hide behind it properly now, his faced pressed against the dog’s tail as it sprouted and wagged in front of him. Warm light ran up the tip, fur floofing out. The fur brushed past his nostrils and he had to stifle a sneeze. <br />
<br />
The warm light tingled his skin, and Jeff became aware of a smell. It was like wet dog and a virile musk. His nose twitched as the light continued to bath his general area and Jeff found himself softly snuffling for the source of the alluring smell and found his nose press against the dog’s hind end. The scents were telling him something-that the dog in front of him was horny and needy and very healthy.<br />
<br />
He panted happily, nostrils flaring as he took another whiff, his cock going rigid in his pants. Warm waves were tugging at his face, pulling it forward. Jeff groaned in pleasure, his tongue lolling out. It was such a nice scent, so nice it made his mouth water. Drool dribbled from his tongue as it started to lengthen.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened his mouth, jaws creaking as the warmth tugged his face, stretching it like taffy, and gave the pucker in front of him a long lap. It tasted savory, like organ meat, something his tongue found absolutely delightful. His face prickled as soft fur blossomed across it, jaw aching as it finished shaping into a muzzle. <br />
<br />
He licked his blackening chops and sniffed at the furry testicles hanging just below the twitching anus. They grew taut as he nosed them, snuffling and inhaling more of that nice musk. Warmth was tingling on the top of his head now, his ears rising to the top of a skull that was being gently compressed.<br />
<br />
His ears unfurled like wings into big, furry, triangular things. That smell pervaded his nose again, smokey, musky, alluring. He looked around for the source. Then his eyes centered on the big red cock that dangled erect between the German Shepherd’s legs, dripping precum onto the tiled floor. It looked so juicy, Jeff wanted to feel it on his tongue. <br />
<br />
The dog twitched, blinking as it came to life. <br />
<br />
“Molding Complete!’ The mechanical voice said cheerily. “Scanning for other targets!”<br />
<br />
The nice warmth that had seeped into his skull faded, as well as the strange tingling in his brain. Jeff cocked his much smaller head at the sound of the voice, struggling to parse what it was saying. The dog was complete, why was it looking for more targets?<br />
<br />
As the robotic arm swiveled, the muzzle of the laser sweeping across the room, the German Shepard’s ears twitched and it turned its head. Jeff and the dog’s eyes met. The German Shepard&#39;s tail began to wag.<br />
<br />
The dog whined, turning and sniffing Jeff’s face. <br />
<br />
Jeff let the dog’s breath wash over him. It had never been fed, so the breath was oddly fresh and moist as it blew across the nascent fur on his dog-like face. Jeff found himself carefully sniffing the dog back, his cock rigid. It was a handsome dog.<br />
<br />
The dog continued sniffing him, lapping at Jeff’s face.  Jeff licked it back, returning the affection. He could practically feel the machine’s cold, mechanical gaze on him, but he couldn’t help himself, wanting the handsome dog to know he wanted him as well. <br />
<br />
Then the big German shepherd circled around him.<br />
<br />
Jeff could see the machine now, the camera, focusing down at the dog as its tail wagged and it sniffed at Jeff’s rear end. Warm, gentle light bathed his body and Jeff flinched as his clothes disintegrated, scraps of fabric fluttering to the floor and disappeared. Then the light shut off and the camera moved on, sweeping the room. <br />
<br />
He let his tongue loll out and started panting again, glad the machine had only removed his clothing. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt a cool nose nudge his rear end, snuffling it. The dog began to lick his hole. Jeff  yelped as the warm, moist tongue lapped softly at his pucker. He happily endured the dog’s probing licks, even when he felt his clenched ring part and that warm tongue entered him. <br />
<br />
Jeff let out a soft whuff and relaxed as the dog continued thoroughly cleaning him out. The tongue entered him over and over, brushing past something that sent jolts of pleasure to his brain. His cock was achingly hard, his own musky scent filling the air.<br />
<br />
The camera refocused on them just as the big dog raised himself up and mounted Jeff. <br />
<br />
Jeff waited, pucker quivering, for the dog’s hot rocket to spread his hole. The German Shephard thrust unsuccessfully a few times, his hot cock stabbing Jeff’s taint and sliding away. He let out a quiet snort of annoyance. It was weird-shaped, it probably wouldn’t fit anyways-<br />
<br />
With his next thrust, the big dog scored a direct hit. Jeff wheezed as the cock entered him, spearing his hole. Instead of pulling back, the dog adjusted himself on Jeff’s back, forelegs squeezing him tight, and thrust deeper.<br />
<br />
Jeff groaned as the cock spread him wide. <br />
<br />
The camera whirred and Jeff stayed still as the red light played over their forms. The German Shepard&#39;s warm tongue lapped against the base of his neck. It thrust again, spreading him open further, and Jeff tried to relax. A gentle, tingly warmth engulfed his pucker. <br />
<br />
Jeff moaned as his hole stretched wider somehow, the big red cock sliding in easily, filling him up.<br />
<br />
The pain began to wash away, replaced with a soothing warmth. It was still uncomfortable, but not physically painful. The warmth moved up his back. As the beam pulled away, Jeff felt his spine pop and pull away with it, fur floofing out into a proper waggly tail. He wagged it as much as he could, the pleasant feelings spreading as a brown fur coat with a darker saddled began to cover his body.<br />
<br />
A gentle warmth tingled on the back of his head. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s big ears tickled under the long, loving waves of warmth and flicked involuntarily. The German Shephard shifted again on top of him, the thrusts smoother and deeper, bumping against something that made Jeff moan in pleasure. His nose flared, picking up that delicious musky odor they dog gave off. Jeff’s mouth opened, tongue lolling out involuntarily as he began to pant happily.<br />
<br />
It all felt so good. <br />
<br />
The tongue on his ears moved to the back of his head. He wanted to be good for his mate, submissive and obedient. Jeff relaxed more, arching his back so the dog could get better access. His cock dripped precum onto the floor, so hard and hot. The licks gently soothed away all anxieties in his mind. Jeff whimpered in pleasure as his mate claimed him.<br />
<br />
The German Shephard lay its head over Jeff’s shoulder as the gentle laps at the back of his skull continued.<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced behind him and saw the beam’s red gaze as it beat down on the back of his head.<br />
<br />
That should have set off alarm bells, but the warm tingles in his brain dissipated those thoughts before they could even begin. The German Shepherd behind him picked up his pace and Jeff yowled full throatedly. It’s cock was a hot spear of spear of pleasure now, the dog’s hips a blur. His ass felt so warm, the discomfort a distant memory. <br />
<br />
The German Shephard whined and licked Jeff’s face. Jeff licked the dog back, enjoying his taste, his virile scent. The Shepard&#39;s hips bucked, bumping that sweet spot inside of him. The warm gentle licks on the back of his head grew in intensity. <br />
<br />
As though to reward him, the cock inside of Jeff seemed to swell even larger, making his ring stretch pleasantly. Jeff was growing tired of fighting, all he wanted to do was let the dog fuck him, revel in the pleasure. The back of his skull slowly collapsed, warm tingles shooting through his brain.<br />
<br />
His mind whirred as he inhaled new scents, even deeper and more complex than just the smell of two horny dogs fucking. The warmth gently guided his thoughts towards when he was born. He remembered the bitch who whelped him, nursed him at her teat. Jeff tried to shake the thought away, but the warmth was so nice and soothing that he could only relax and let the memory settle in deep, his childhood beginning to change.<br />
<br />
The beam swept gently across his body, down to his back legs and Jeff felt his knees pop and reverse, the heels rising, pulled upwards, until he was standing on his pads.  The German Shephard had even better access now. Something large was bumping against his rear end.<br />
<br />
That bump at the base of the dog’s cock kept slamming into his pucker. <br />
<br />
Jeff could feel it begin to stretch. Whatever pain that might bring was washed away in a wave of pleasant tingles. Jeff stopped lapping at the other dog’s muzzle as he basked in the fuzzy warmth, just enjoying the feelings. He felt the beam play along his arms, watching them shift bemusedly into front legs. It all felt so nice, he was feeling so full and warm.<br />
<br />
The beam worked its way back up to his head. Changes swept through him. His abs tightened and pulled up, innards compressing. Jeff’s ribs bulked out and grew into a proper basket shape, and Jeff gave a light wheeze. It finally made it to his head, Jeff completely a dog now.<br />
<br />
Warmth soothed his thoughts, gently pushing them again, and Barkin remembered being picked up by a nice man who smelled good and cradled the puppy in his arms. <br />
<br />
Barkin’s eyes began to glaze as more memories poured in, the black-furred German Shephard losing itself completely in the warm, gentle waves and tingles of his memories. The dog behind him was bucking fast, hips a blur, each stroke sparking pleasure from something deep inside of him. <br />
<br />
Barkins went through academy training, one of the dumbest dogs on the force, but somehow managed to pull it off and become a proper police dog.<br />
<br />
The German Shephard on top of him gave growled and gave one final buck, thrusting hard.<br />
<br />
Barkins gasped as the knot blew his hole wide open and wedged itself in his hole. The pleasure and feeling of fullness was so overwhelming that Jet never noticed his identity shift or the memories of academy training firmly settle in. <br />
<br />
With a howl, the dog’s huge cock twitched deep inside of Jet and painted his insides with champion German Shephard see. The last bits of memory cemented themselves in Barkin’s skull. One final, coaxing wave of warmth echoed through his compressed brain. <br />
<br />
Barkin whined and came hard onto the office floor. <br />
<br />
The light shut off and the machine whirred and clicked off, entering sleep mode.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
“Well, ready for your first day on the force, officer Barkins?” Mr. Walters chuckled as he walked into the room.<br />
<br />
He paused, shocked, as two dogs swiveled their heads in his direction. Where had the other dog come from? Was it a student? Or maybe-<br />
<br />
His eyes fell on the space where the chair should have been. Nearby, a broken Velcro strap lay on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Thought you could trick it, huh?” Mr Walters laughed and walked over to the dogs where they lay perfectly still beneath the machine. “Looks like you two are going to be perfect for whoever I hire to be the new security guard.”<br />
<br />
“Accepted!” The machine said cheerfully, whirring to life. A hum began to build. “Occupation: Security Guard! Enjoy your molding!”<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Mr. Walters held up a hand. “Stop! Voice command: Cancel!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, but I’m afraid I cannot halt an operation while it is in progress,” The machine said cheerfully. “Please wait until the operation is finished.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters turned to run.<br />
<br />
A red light enveloped him.</p>
