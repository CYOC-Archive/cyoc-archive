<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Um, Dad?&quot; Jeff prompted, becoming slightly impatient. His dad rubbed at the back of his head and cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah, I think I know what I want, son...&quot; He moved the cursor, selecting one of the presets, then stepped back so that Jeff could see. The blush on Mike&#39;s cheeks was ominous, but was not enough to prepare his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;A stripper!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem, yeah,&quot; Mike repeated. &quot;I... well, you know how into sports I am, son, and... and well, poledancing is a sport? And well... I&#39;ve always wondered... what would it be like... if instead of this body... I was sleek and sexy...&quot; His voice dropped almost so low that Jeff couldn&#39;t hear. &quot;...Busty...&quot; He cleared his throat again, now <i>really</i> blushing. &quot;How it would feel, to have other men look at me that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Jeff almost felt bad about his reaction, seeing his Dad so... apologetic. Ashamed, even. But on the other hand... <i>A stripper!?</i> He fidgeted in his chair, not wanting to judge, but not really liking the idea of his Dad... doing that... even if it was only temporary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve actually been into it -- had this fantasy -- for a while,&quot; Mike admitted. &quot;So uh, yeah, it would mean a lot if...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Dad, okay.&quot; Jeff took a deep breath. He couldn&#39;t say no to his father -- in fact, if this would make his Dad happy, he guessed it would be worth the humilation to him. &quot;Your birthday is in a week, so I&#39;ll set it to last for a week... think of it like a birthday present.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went to work, scanning in his Dad, choosing the preset, adjusting the timer to a week. Selecting that only the two of them would be aware of the change. His Dad helped him confirm the &quot;dimensions&quot; of his new body, becoming obviously excited, and suggested a new name. For the coming week, he would be &quot;Mariel.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, the moment of truth. Jeff hit &quot;Save,&quot; then turned to his Dad. Part of him hoped it wouldn&#39;t work. Despite how excited he&#39;d been to get the Chronivac, at this moment he would have been glad if it were a hoax.<br />
<br />
But it was not, and Mike caught his breath as pleasurable warmth spread through him.<br />
<br />
The first thing to noticeably change was his scruff of beard, which smoothed away to nothing, leaving behind a narrower, more delicate face. The rest of his body hair faded at the same time, and Mike could feel his body start to... <i>shift</i> as fat turned to muscle and msucle to fat, his mass moving around his body in what felt like a sensual massage. At the same time, the years began to melt away, filling his body with renewed vigour and passion.<br />
<br />
The sagging belly he waged a losing war against at the gym vanished into a tight, athletic core; sliding down to become healthy fat across his rear and thighs, filling them out in beautiful curves to match his widening hips. His broad shoulders drew together and his hard pecs began to round out into a generous bust; the muscles in his limbs became lean, built for endurance and flexibility rather than brute strength, and their excess bulk flowed into his increasingly lush curves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh... oh Gooood that feels good...&quot; Jeff blushed and... <i>almost</i> looked away as Mike began to massage his growing tits. His spine curved, accentuating his bust and stealing away a bit more of his height. Another groan, wordless and intense, and Jeff winced as his saw his Dad clutch at his groin. Or, at this point, <i>her</i> groin.<br />
<br />
A shiver ran through Mike -- <i>Mariel</i> -- as she felt her balls suck up into her, her hardening cock shrink down into a super-sensitive nub buried in a fleshy hood. &quot;Ohhh G-God...&quot; Despite her son watching her, she couldn&#39;t keep from rubbing at herself through her shorts, feeling her new vaginal lips part and begin spilling hot wetness. She didn&#39;t want to embarrass the boy... but it felt <i>so good.</i><br />
<br />
Meanwhile her clothing had also changed to match. The cargo pants remained, only becoming tighter, molding around her thick hips and plush ass. Her T-shirt turned into a red halter-top, pulling up to reveal the outline of a faint four-pack and a red-inked tattoo of a fox head super-imposed on a pair of spreading rose branches below her belly-button. While her underwear changed to panties, she did not have a bra on -- as Jeff could see by the stiff nipples pushing at the red fabric.<br />
<br />
<i>Oh great.</i> Despite himself, there was an answering stiffness in Jeff&#39;s pants. Watching his sister grow into a beautiful woman had been hard enough. Now he had to deal with his father turning into the literal embodiment of a stripper fantasy. <i>At least it&#39;s only for a week.</i><br />
<br />
Red lipstick appeared on Mariel&#39;s now full lips, liner and shadow around her bright green eyes, accented her long lashes and narrow eyebrows. Her hair now cascaded nearly to her heart-shaped rear; the formerly plain brown brightened to a rich auburn, highlighted with red so that it kindled like fire in the right light. Her smooth skin lost its weathered look for a light, even tan, the lines of stress and premature age erased. Her fingers grew long and slender, tipped with red nails.<br />
<br />
More subtly, her outlook on the world changed. While she was still &quot;Mike&quot; in most ways, Mariel was stunning and she owned it. It gave her confidence and joy in life that she&#39;d never had as a man. Being a stripper was a natural extension of that. She had the body, she had the skills; nothing felt better than showing them off to a needy crowd! Getting money thrown at her was a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
As the changes came to a stop, the arousal receded slightly. She was panting and still horny in a delightfully different way, but Mariel was able to pull her hands away from her erogenous zones. &quot;Ah... ah, sorry son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no problem, D-Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of groping herself, she put one hand to her smooth throat, realising for the first time that her voice had become high-pitched, breathy, and <i>seductive.</i> She examined the other, marveling at her elegant it looked, from the narrow wrist to the painted, manicured nails.<br />
<br />
She was every inch a woman -- five foot ten inches to be exact, slightly shorter than her old 6&#39;; though with her heeled pumps she was nearly as tall as before. A bombshell with full, firm DD breasts and an hourglass figure. While her ID still registered her as 42, she looked -- and felt -- half that age.<br />
<br />
In a word, she was <i>amazing.</i> Too amazing to be embarrassed herself at the effect she had on her son. Instead, Mariel smiled, amused and a little proud. She knew why Jeff had angled his chair so that she could no longer see his crotch. But she wasn&#39;t going to comment on it -- she didn&#39;t want to embarrass <i>him.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would be more... mmm... more appropriate to call me &#39;Mom,&#39;&quot; she suggested, trying hard not to be distracted by the way her shorts now hugged her ass, or by the moistness in her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sure, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike ruffled her son&#39;s hair again. &quot;Thanks, champ. No, seriously.&quot; She swivelled her son&#39;s chair a bit so she could look him in the eyes, wanting to show how much this really did mean to her. To his credit, Jeff met her gaze. &quot;Thank you so much -- I haven&#39;t felt this great in... ever!&quot; She laughed. &quot;Well, for now, I think I&#39;ll, mmm... I&#39;ll go to my room and... see if my other outfits have changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah. They, um, should&#39;ve.&quot; <i>Actually...</i> Now that his dad mentioned it, he didn&#39;t really <i>look</i> like a stripper. &quot;Uh, D- er, Mom? What about... mentally? You&#39;re dressed, well, kind of... normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, of course, champ!&quot; Mariel laughed again. &quot;I&#39;m not going to wear my work clothes around the house. Don&#39;t worry; I know how to dance, how to take care of myself. I&#39;ll go down to a club this evening and get a job. I know just the one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mariel turned to leave. Jeff stared as his dad -- now mom -- walked out of the room, unconsciously swaying her hips as if she&#39;d been seducing men her whole life.</p>
