<br />
&quot;A tail?&quot; Teddy spoke into one of the small walkie-talkies that had been provided to the teams involved, &quot;you&#39;re sure this wasn&#39;t just a loose belt or a disguise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given that it seemed to get longer as he ran... no, it was a tail of some kind,&quot; came the answer from the filed agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still chasing him?&quot; Teddy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not, sir,&quot; the Seattle field agent spoke, &quot;he came out with his buddies and they tried to pin us down. We took down the Rat Pack, but your suspect managed to get away in the confusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Teddy cursed, &quot;do you have any idea where he went?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;North... I think, but we lost sight of him during the gunfight with the rest of his gang,&quot; the Seattle field agent answered.<br />
<br />
The only thing that Teddy wanted to do was curse at the situation. The Seattle PD officers with local FBI agents were placed to isolate the warehouse that Lionel Ulysses was supposed to be in. Teddy had gone with the main team that was expected to make the arrest on Ulysses and his gang, the Rat Pack, and was ready put an end to the man&#39;s present run from the law. However, from there, nothing went right. Just as Teddy and the main team was getting ready to enter the warehouse, a pipe bomb went off on the other side of the main doors. The blast disoriented the main team just enough that they couldn&#39;t make a pursuit, and while one of the other ambush teams was there to try and catch them, they weren&#39;t able to stop him completely.<br />
<br />
Ryan Connor was also fairly frustrated, though for a slightly different reason. He had overheard the report that Ulysses was seen fleeing with a tail, which had to mean that at some point in this entire adventure, he had to have transformed, which ran the real risk of exposing were-beasts to the world. That fear was pretty much the reason Chief O&#39;Hara had agreed to Agent Green&#39;s request. The Moon Lake PD knew that the FBI agent investigating Lionel Ulysses already knew about were-beasts and had likely married one, so Theodore Green wasn&#39;t the main concern. The main concern was the officers that weren&#39;t that knowledgeable on weres, as they had to protect Moon Lake&#39;s secret, or at least have things set out so that if Moon Lake and its were-beast population were exposed to the rest of humanity, that it was handled in the best way possible. Ryan Connor&#39;s primary task was to help keep things quiet and to make sure that Ulysses couldn&#39;t expose himself or anyone else as a were-beast of some kind.<br />
<br />
As a werewolf, Ryan Connor felt fully confident in being able to handle Lionel Ulysses, a wererat, but so far, things had gone counter to both Agent Green&#39;s plan to get a murderer off the streets and Moon Lake&#39;s hope to protect its secrecy. The detonation of the pipe bomb, while it had done no serious damage, was enough to delay the main part of the team and allowed Ulysses to take advantage of the rest of the ambush units dealing with the rest of his gang and to get away. The fact that Ulysses might have transformed was the threat Moon Lake had feared. However, with so many others around, Ryan couldn&#39;t talk with Agent Green privately on how to deal with the situation.<br />
<br />
The main team mad their way the warehouse quickly. They didn&#39;t stop to investigate the remains of the pipe bomb or any other pieces of evidence that might have been left behind in the warehouse. They&#39;d surely have to check them, but apprehending Lionel Ulysses was the key goal for the moment.Especially if the main ambush had failed, Ulysses had to be desperate now, which would make him even more dangerous. They found the gathered officers and agents clustered around the bodies of several men in tattered and ripped clothing. Detective Smith and Detective Holmes were quick to move to them and looked them over.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like we got the rest of the Rat Pack,&quot; Agent Peters commented off hand.<br />
<br />
Noting that these men were all dead as seen by the obvious gunshot wounds to the chest that them had taken and the blood that pooled either beneath them or on them on their clothing being the indicator. In a way, getting the Rat Pack off the street helped, but they were really more of a side benefit to the main mission, which was to capture Ulysses and go from there. Detective Smith turned to both Teddy and Agent Peters. At the same time, Ryan caught what was likely Ulysses&#39; scent. While the two FBI agents approached the Seattle police detectives, he began to follow that scent slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the raid wasn&#39;t a complete failure,&quot; Detective Smith commented, &quot;We may not have caught Ulysses, but we certainly broke the Rat Pack for the immediate future. These are all the members of the gang besides Ulysses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy looked to each of the dead gang members where they lay and sighed. Getting them off the streets was one thing, but with them dead it wasn&#39;t like they could help give them any clue as to where Ulysses might go now that his hideout was in their hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish we could have gotten them alive,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;that might give us some idea as to where our chief suspect went.&quot;<br />
<br />
He voice sounded a bit down, as though it would be a harder case to complete than he had thought after so many breaks in the case that had gotten them to the point where they had a chance of catching a man who had murdered a US Marine for no reason worth defending. He then looked directly to the agent he had been talking with and who had reported on Lionel Ulysses and his escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;As his capture is the main goal of our mission,&quot; Teddy continued, &quot;we could have used them alive to close the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may not be a problem,&quot; came Ryan&#39;s voice from a side.<br />
<br />
It was at this point that Teddy noticed that Ryan hadn&#39;t followed them to inspect the bodies, but had gone down the path that had been reported to be Lionel Ulysses escape path. He was also pointing to something on the ground. Teddy was quick to approach and looked down to see spots of blood on the cement and saw that they went in a sort of looping train that Ulysses had run on.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may not have caught Lionel Ulysses, but it is clear that someone shot him and wounded him,&quot; Ryan commented, &quot;we might be able to follow the trail to Ulysses, as it&#39;s doubtful he&#39;s going to get far...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right...&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;and we can follow the blood trail for awhile while we wait for a K-9 unit. If he has a bullet in him, he might even head to a hospital to get it taken out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or to find a secluded space to let himself heal,&quot; Ryan thought to himself, &quot;weres might be able to heal from a lot, and he might still heal faster than a human would from a gunshot wound, but it wouldn&#39;t be enough for him to be a true threat to anyone in Moon Lake. Getting shot might have triggered a transformation out of reflex to accelerate the healing.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ulysses made a quick path to try and get away from the area. He&#39;d expected the FBI to be involved given who he had murdered, but even he had to admit that he&#39;d taken a bit of a loss today. While his pipe bomb was enough to deter the main assault group, he hadn&#39;t expected the waiting backup. He went to raise his pistol when he caught a round in the shoulder that spun him around. The rest of the Rat Pack came to his defense, but their being gunned down only provided a distraction to get away. He knew he needed them for more than that.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d felt his plot for revenge was complete with Jeff Decker&#39;s murder complete and he could move in and claim Jen as his own. However, the news report announcing Jeff Decker&#39;s murder soon mentioned a son, which made Lionel Ulysses realize that his job was only half done. He&#39;d need to get the son too, just to make sure that there was no one to keep Jen away from him. However, the only address he had for them was their old address in Virginia. He had no idea where the Decker family had moved to, but that was where his gang came into play. They could find the Decker family for him and be ready for whenever Lionel was out of major trouble with the law. But now, his gang was dead, he didn&#39;t know where Jen Decker lived, and he had a bad wound in his shoulder  that left him with a bloody shoulder and some of his blood leaving a trail. The only thing he could do now was hope the police and the feds didn&#39;t chase him...<br />
<br />
He also had to find  a spot to relax and calm down, as the pain of the gunshot wound had made him transform out of reflex. It would take time for him to resume his more human like appearance.</p>
