<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben was in the moving van with his fiance Megan. He&#39;d never heard of this Uncle before, but a lawyer informed him of his inheritance out of the blue a month ago. Megan was excited because the two of you had talked about moving into a larger place after you were married, but hadn&#39;t made any real strides in actually making it a reality. 15 acres of land, not much when you consider the size of other farms, but massive when it came to the places he had previously lived. The will stipulated, he needed to keep the farm going for at least a year, after that he could do what he wanted with the property. Ben didn&#39;t know if he wanted to be a farmer, especially a cattle farmer, but Megan had convinced him to give it a chance. <br />
<br />
As they pulled up to the lot, he saw a woman in a business suit standing by the front gate. She had tan skin and black hair tied up in a ponytail. Her makeup was profesional and her curves were modest, over all Ben thought she was attractive, but nothing compared to Megan. His fiance was a fiesty redhead with a killer bod. Not the curviest, but her boobs were perky and butt was taut and she was only a head shorter than he was, so it was easy for him to lift her in his arms and have his way with her. Not that he did that very often. Ben was a shy man with modest taste. It was Megan who asked him out when they were 16. Now 25 years old and through with collage the two of them were ready to really build a life together. <br />
<br />
Ben stopped the van and walked up to the women. She was actually taller than Ben was, but only by an inch. He reached out to shake her outstretched hand with a polite smile. &quot;Ms. Austin I presume,&quot; Ben greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Kingsly, yes, nice to meet you in person,&quot; the woman greeted. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is my fiances, Megan,&quot; Ben introduces. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasure,&quot; she said shaking the woman&#39;s hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, as I said on the phone, I&#39;m the one overseeing the inheritance. I will be doing monthly visits to the farm to insure you are meeting the standards stipulated in the will. I also have the necessary banking information and property documentation you&#39;ll need,&quot; Ms. Austin informed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood. I assume you also have the keys to the gate and the house?&quot; Ben speculated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Correct. Allow me to open the gates and I will give you a brief tour,&quot; she informed. <br />
<br />
Ben and Megan got back in the van and followed Ms. Austin onto the property. It was quaint, with a nice flat landscape and long but kept grass. The road was a dirt path free of rocks and debris and the house could be seen in the distance. As they got closer, it became more and more apparent that the house was huge, larger than the barn even. It was painted white with windows choicely placed around the exterier. The front door was a large pair of double doors and there was even a rolling garage door on the size of the house that faced the barn. A bit odd, but Ben didn&#39;t know the first thing about farming, so who was he to judge the choice in architecture. <br />
<br />
Both parked near the front porch and got out of their respective vehicles. Megan&#39;s eyes were gleaming. She&#39;d never seen a house this big before, and it was all hers. She imagined little ones running around the yard playing ball as Ben worked the fields in overalls with no shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is she alright?&quot; Ms. Austin asked, staring at Megan.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s fine, just excited about the new house,&quot; Ben chuckled as he watched his fiance play out a fantasy in her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t she want to see the inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give her a minute, she&#39;ll come back to reality. Open the door and she&#39;ll join us when she realizes we&#39;re gone,&quot; Ben assured.<br />
<br />
Ben and Ms. Austin went inside and Ben whistled as he saw a fully furnished home. It was nicely decorated, but humble. Equiped with modern amenities like televsion and internet, but nothing top of the line. &quot;As I recall, your uncle had big plans for this palce before his passing. My condolences,&quot; they lawyer offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said before, I never met the man. Honestly, the more I see of the place, the more apprehensive I get,&quot; Ben explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I could see how one could consider it too good to be true. However, I&#39;ve gone through all the paperwork, I&#39;ve seen nothing nefarious in my readings,&quot; she reassured.<br />
<br />
&quot;No offense, but I don&#39;t know you that well, and I don&#39;t really know how to read legaleze. Your word on the matter doesn&#39;t mean much, but I don&#39;t have the ability to argue about it,&quot; Ben elaborated. <br />
<br />
&quot;You could always hire a lawyer of your own to go over the documentation,&quot; she offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That requires money we don&#39;t have. Megan and I just graduated collage, and we&#39;re planning on getting married. So every negitive dime has to go to paying off our student debt and the wedding. I just hope my agreeing to this doesn&#39;t leave us destitute,&quot; Ben sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see your concern, but your uncle was intellagent in his book keeping. He left you a fund to help you get the farm going. Work hard and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll pull through,&quot; she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Ben sighed with a small grin. &quot;Let&#39;s go over everything one more time.&quot;<br />
<br />
After several minutes of discussion with Ms. Austin and looking at documents, Ben became concerned that Megan hadn&#39;t come inside yet. &quot;I should probably go check on her,&quot; he stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me. Please keep reading, I&#39;ll expalin any questions you have when I return,&quot; she offered. <br />
<br />
Ms. Austin walked out the front doors and scanned the property for the petite ginger. She saw her standing in front of the barn, trying to open the massive, swinging doors. She walked over to the struggling redhead, unable to supress the giggle that escaped as she watched the younger woman bite at the metal chain in a futile attempt to open the doors. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you wanted to look inside, all you needed to do was ask,&quot; she said, making Megan whip around with a blush. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t want to interupt. I know Ben is nervous about this, and I wanted him to have plenty of time to ask losts of questions so he can stop worrying,&quot; Megan explained. &quot;When I saw the barn there was somthing, different about it. It made me want to go inside and have a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t refute that. There was somthing oddly enticing about the barn that beckoned her inside it. Ms. Austin took out the keys and opened the doors. It was plain but tidy. 15 stales in total with a ladder that led to a second floor and a smaller pair of double doors in the back. Each of the stalls was large with a verticly swinging gate to allow the cattle in and out of the enclosure. What was odd however was a metal bar that ran along the back wall of the stales with a monitor mounted above them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who puts a tv in a barn?&quot; Megan asked curiously as she approched the closest stale. <br />
<br />
&quot;And 15 no less,&quot; Ms. Austin concurred. She saw a power switch on the wall currently set to off. Seeing no other switch, she assumed it was the lights and flipped it to the on position. The lights turned on and so did the monitors, changing to a purple and black spiraling pattern. &quot;What the?&quot; she exclaimed as she looked at the odd pattern. How strange it was. Who would have set a barn up like this. It seemed completly unnecessary. A cow wouldn&#39;t need all this. Unless there was some study out there that said cows were more docile when presented with this kind of image. Ms. Austin couldn&#39;t deny, she liked the spirals. She subconsiously walked toward the nearest monitor, opposite the one Megan was currently approaching. It just felt so enticing, she simply needed to get closer to it. Once inside the stale the latch closed and a tube came down from the ceiling. Both women unknowingly opened their mouths and accepted the tube. <br />
<br />
A thick, white liquid traveled down the tubes and both women obediently swallowed mouth full after mouth full of the mysterious concoction. It tasted so good, why wouldn&#39;t they keep drinking it? The spirals said it was the right thing to do, and the spirals always know what&#39;s best. The feeding when on for minutes, the tubes evenly dispencing the liquid. Megan grabbed hold of the bar in front of her and leaned on it for support as she rubbed her thighes together. She felt so good. Her crotch was trobbing, but she didn&#39;t bring her fingers down to stimulate herself to eventual release. It wasn&#39;t her place to do that. <br />
<br />
Ms. Austin began to feel an odd tension around her waist. A tightening. She wanted to know what was causing this uncomfortable sensation that was distracting her from the wonderful spirals and delicious feeding. The feeling became more and more uncomfortable, edgeing on painful. It almost made her look away from the lovely spirals when a loud snapping noise synchronized with the sweet release of tension. A few more minutes passed and more tension appeared but it wasn&#39;t as painful or long lasting as the other one, in time it too disappeared each with its own popping noise and a cooling sensation on her belly. <br />
<br />
A loud buzzing noise sounded and the heavenly liquid stopped pouring out of the tube. The women couldn&#39;t help but tongue the hose when the feeding stopped and both whimpered when it retracted back into the ceiling. Both women were left wanting more as there lower lips dripped with need. All at once the monitors turned off and Megan and Ms. Austin both blinked a few times at the sudden disappearance. <br />
<br />
&quot;What, what happened?&quot; Megan asked, her mind slowly coming down from the soothing experiece. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Ms. Austin groggily respanwed as she turned around to look at the girl. Both women saw each other at the same time, but realization was slow. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?/Huh?&quot; both said in unison as they stared at the basketball sized belly both women were now sporting. As they looked down at themselves, reality began to take hold. &quot;What the hell!?/How in the world!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ms. Austin&#39;s hands shot to the taut, reddened sphere that was her stomache. Her belt had burst and her shirt and jacket had lost several buttons to accominate her new swollen torso. Megan, having been wearing only a tshirt, lost only her pants button. She pulled up her shirt to look at her own engorged abdomen. Being the shorter woman, Megan&#39;s belly looked larger than Ms. Austin&#39;s, but both orbs were the same size, as both woman had consumed the same about of liquid. Her face beat red, Megan was concerned about her suddenly enlarged gut, but she couldn&#39;t help the idea that she liked the look. Or atleast, a facsimile. She lowered her shirt and cupped her protruding paunch with a giggle. She couldn&#39;t wait for Ben to knock her up. She&#39;d wanted children for so long, and now she was truely on the cusp. She had a fiance, a house, and this belly made it seem like it had already happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;God I&#39;m so horny,&quot; Megan cussed as she bit her lip and rubbed her center. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ms. Austin cried out in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just imagining myself with Ben&#39;s bun in my oven. Looking like this all the time. It&#39;s so hot,&quot; Megan moaned. <br />
<br />
Ms. Austin had been horrifed by the discovery of her stomache, or she tried to be. She knew that this was unnatrual and it would be a disaster for her career if anyone from the office saw her like this, but a growing part of her liked Megan&#39;s comparison. Ms. Austin was 32 years old and single. She&#39;d always put her career first and felt no shame in doing so, but suddenly the idea of a hot young stud putting a baby in her made her tremble. <br />
<br />
&quot;Megan, Ms. Austin, where are you?&quot; Ben called out from outside the barn. Both women looked at the open door. Megan grinned ear to ear while Ms. Austin shuddered with a nervous smile.</p>
