<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Frieda,” Benton sighing; “remember what I said about change being difficult for me? Getting a dog is a big deal and a big change.”<br />
“Are you not worried for my safety,” Frieda countering; “what if another group of men decide to break into our home?”<br />
“It will be the last thing they ever do,” Benton looking serious; “I may have never taken a human life before, but that doesn’t mean I won’t do so, if you or Amanda are in danger.”<br />
“Think of it this way,” Frieda trying to win the argument; “a dog will act as an added layer of security. May I remind you that when the staff left after you knocked out Jeffery, the security staff also left.”<br />
<br />
Benton’s face contorts into a grim pout; his disposition souring as he understands Frieda’s logic, but he looks at his daughter as he comes up with his counter point.<br />
“May I remind you,” Benton speaking; “that pets and weres don’t exactly get along.”<br />
“Not if you get them while they are young,” Frieda countering; “that way they get use to our scent. While we may be were-panthers and are clearly stronger then normals,” Frieda adding; “that doesn’t mean there aren&#39;t disreputable weres that don’t make a living as criminals.”<br />
“Even they would be foolish to break into my home,” Benton bristling.<br />
“The ones in town maybe,” Frieda looking serious; “and we do have several shady weres in town.”<br />
“And how do you know that,” Benton looking concerned; “has Spencer or Eric been dragging you to places of ill repute?”<br />
“No,” Frieda snorting; “but when I had to babysit Darrel Cooper for the Sheriff and his girlfriend, I have overheard many times as he grumbled at having were-rats and were-skunks in his jail over petty crimes and the odd break-in.”<br />
“Even a dog is no match for a were,” Benton responding; “local or out of town.”<br />
“Yet when a were comes across a dog or any animal,” Frieda countering; “even they pause to determine if they have to bare their claws in self-defense.”<br />
<br />
“Think of it this way,” Frieda speaking up before Benton could counter the argument; “you also need to take up a hobby. Looking after a large dog….”<br />
“A dog is not a hobby,” Benton sighing; “it is a responsibility, and a big one at that. A hobby is something like stamp collecting or assembling models. Plus,&quot; Benton looking at his daughter; “you already have a pet snake, much to your mother’s bizarre phobia regarding them. What’s next after a dog, a bird?”<br />
“By a bird,” Frieda smiling; “you mean a Raven so we can quote Edgar Allan Poe, then why not?”<br />
“Now you are deliberately trying to get my goat,” Benton chuckling; &quot;but in all seriousness, a dog is something we need to discuss with your mother. It’s not something you and I can just come home with and say to your mother, ‘Surprise!’”<br />
“But you will consider getting a dog,” Frieda pressing the issue.<br />
“We’ll talk about that with your mother,” Benton responding as he put his card down for the bill for the lunch; “with that being said, any other place you want to go to today?”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“Frieda has made a couple of comments to the photos we posted,” Eric looking at his phone.<br />
Spencer hands her brother back to her mother who gently places the child in his crib; smiling as she happily coos the baby back to sleep.<br />
“If you two don’t mind,” Maggie looking at Spencer and Eric; “talk downstairs. Let the baby sleep.”<br />
<br />
Heeding Maggie’s advice, both Eric and Spencer head to the living room; sitting down on the sofa as they both read Frieda’s comments and a few others, while responding to a few of them. Evan quietly joins them, while his father Mike lawson who is now out of his werewolf fursona and currently busy warming up the bbq.<br />
“Mike will be getting lunch going in a bit,” Evan looking at the two; “in the meantime, let’s talk about last night.”<br />
“Well,” Spencer putting down her phone and encouraging Eric to do the same; “you already know the major details dad. Four men break into Benton’s house as we were just starting to eat supper with the cubs we were babysitting. I knock out one of the men…”<br />
“Yes,” Evan stopping his daughter; “yet the other three were killed. One by you Spencer; another by the butler and the third by Eric here. It’s the last that you wanted us to discuss,” Evan looking at his daughter then at Eric; “so let’s talk about having to take a life and how… uncomfortable it can be.”<br />
<br />
“Spencer did say,” Eric sighing; “that you would be the best person to get advice on dealing with killing a person. You being a former Navy Seal and all Evan.”<br />
“It’s not easy having to take a person’s life,” Evan looking serious; “more so if you see the person’s eyes as their life fades. I’m assuming that is what you experienced Eric.”<br />
“Watching him struggle as he fought to take a breath,” Eric shuddering; “hearing his last heartbeats, how do I live with that?”<br />
“One day at a time,” Evan answers; “while I cannot get into the details of some of my missions. As they are all still classified; I can tell you that yes I have had to kill a person.”<br />
“What about Bower Sr,” Spencer speaking up; “surely you can discuss that.”<br />
“I suppose,” Evan sighing; “he did cause us all and this town some grief trying to help his son whisk you away. But I will be honest with you both,” Evan sighing; “I took a measure of satisfaction, plunging my blade into him. Yes I was up close and saw him die. Yet not a day goes by,” Evan looking sad; “that I don’t see the man’s face and the faces of everyone else I killed invade my dreams now and then.”<br />
“So you never get over it,” Eric sighs; looking at his hands as he is not in his fursona. “Does that mean I’ll be a emotional wreck every time I shift into my fursona and try to hunt?”<br />
“Is that what this is about,” Evan looking at Eric; “your feel you can’t stomach taking a life after watching someone die by your own paws?”<br />
“Yes,” Eric nearly whispering; “when I punched that man armed with a crowbar, I heard his sternum shatter. Now I knew from reading that town pamphlet that weres are stronger than a normal. But to be able to shatter one of the strongest bones in the human body?”<br />
“We are stronger than a normal person,” Evan responding; “that much is clear. Yet like a normal, we can become stronger when are body is flushed with adrenaline. Just like when you are running, chasing down a large animal, you feel that surge of energy; that primal rush, as you tackle your quarry down. Thats adrenaline, the same that you had when you slugged that man last night. Eric,&quot; Evan placing a comforting hand on the boy; “these feelings you have, they will go away in time.”<br />
“When,” Eric looking glum; “before I had to take that man’s life, I enjoyed hunting. Killing a buck or catching a rabbit to snack on; now, I’m not so sure.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t answer that kid,” Mike joining in the conversation; “but like a kidney stone, those thoughts too will pass.”<br />
“Grandpa,” Spencer wincing at the graphic image Mike just gave them; “did you have to say that before we eat?”<br />
“You don’t even know the whole story,” Evan growling at his father.<br />
“I heard enough to get a good idea as to what Eric is going through,” Mike answering; “and like you son, my dreams are also haunted by the men I killed. It’s why I don’t talk about my time in the trenches of France and Belgium much. There are horrors I experienced,” Mike remembering his time in world war one; “that I don’t ever want to share with either of you.”<br />
“But you have no issue with hunting,” Eric looking at the elder man; “how do you not let what you did effect you as you take the life of buck?”<br />
“Easy,” Mike answering; “I tell myself, I did what was right at the time and I refuse to let it hold me back. Now if you want, you can help me with the steaks for lunch or you can sit here and wallow in self-pity, your choice.</p>
