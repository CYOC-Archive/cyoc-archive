<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will felt dirty and sweaty. She decided to take a shower and try to get out of the apartment so she could figure out what to do next. As she was soaping herself in the hot shower, she couldn't help to be amazed by the sensation of the hot water cascading on her body, it was such a relaxing feeling. Her skin was so smooth. The whole experience of taking a shower in a soft, smooth, unfamiliar body was so sensuous. <br />
 <br />
She couldn't help but think back to the escapades her and James had shared. She soaped herself down by her crotch but was careful not to let her fingers linger. She felt an unfamiliar yearning and sense of emptiness. Being a woman was different and exciting, but unsettling. She didn't like the sense of vulnerability and lack of control, especially around James. All she really wanted was to get her old life back, back to the body she was accustom to.<br />
 <br />
She felt uneasy as she stepped out of the shower. She looked at herself in the mirror as she rubbed herself down with a soft white towel. A smile crossed her face, Wren really is beautiful, she thought, as she stood nude in front of the mirror and used Megan's hair drier to dry her long brown hair. She then began to brush out her hair like she'd been doing it her whole life. She continued to admire herself in the mirror, and posed her body from side to side. <br />
 <br />
She was going to use the towel to cover up with but decided to just hang it up. She knew that Megan would be chewing out James right about now and no one would be in the room. Deciding that her theory has some base to it, she stuck her head out the door, she was right, not a soul. She walked in, feeling the cool hardwood floor on her feet, she felt a chill run through her.<br />
 <br />
Will could hear Megan talking to James in the next room, she was holding herself back, which was good for James. As hot as this body was, she surely couldn't go outside without clothes, so going into Megan's things once more, she went straight to the closet, trying to take as little of Megan's clothes as possible. So she decided to go with no undergarments (always wondering how it felt to do that as a woman, practically naked, it was kinda hot). She grabbed a dress that Megan hadn't ever worn since they'd been together, she said it just never looked right on her. She took it off the hanger, modeling it to the mirror before slipping it on. &quot;Wow, this is gonna make this body look gorgeous.&quot; She said, putting both feet in and pulling the dress up and onto her shoulders. It was pink and had a slight ruffle by the skirt edge which came to just above the knee. Looking in the mirror she smiled, her nice smooth legs were shown off nicely.<br />
<br />
Finishing up with a pair of leg-wrap platform sandals, Will went out to meet with the arguing duo. They grew quiet as she entered. She looked at Megan, who had a stern face, that usually meant that Will had said something idiotic and pissed her off, but this time it was more harsh. Will pouted slightly, feeling sadness over the fact that Megan was mad at her. &quot;I'm truly sorry that I've made you mad Meggi, I didn't mean for any of this to happen.&quot; In a way, she was talking about being turned into a woman. Her eyes glazed over, Will was trying to keep his emotions in check, but it was difficult for him in Wren's body. Looking to James, she nodded. &quot;I guess I'll go back to my place, you still have the key.&quot; He probably should have thought of that when this first happened.<br />
<br />
James nodded, looking at the beautiful pouting Wren, it made his heart melt. &quot;Okay hun, walk safely I know it's only a couple blocks, just be careful, okay?&quot; Megan looked at them both, sighing. &quot;It's okay.&quot; Megan finally stated. &quot;Just don't let it happen again.&quot; She said, winking, she couldn't explain it, but when Wren called her Meggi, it made her calm down, just like when Will always said it.<br />
<br />
Will nodded to both of them, smiling slightly, a small tear fell to her cheek. She walked out the door with not a word more, wiping the tear away as she walked out of the building. &quot;What's wrong with you Will, get a hold of yourself, you're still a man, somewhere....&quot; She sighed, at least Will's house would make him relax, Megan never came there, only as a last resort. She walked down the street, feeling the sun on her skin, it felt great. She noticed glances from those that passed her in their cars, all the men. In a way she liked the attention, but it also scared her, she wanted to be back to normal, in a day the old shopkeeper would have something and he'd be back again.<br />
<br />
Will walked into her apartment, dropping the keys in the normal spot. She sighed, she was very depressed now that she'd actually been kicked out of her girlfriend's apartment, it was so surreal. She went over to the couch, she sat, taking of her sandals, then laying down. Having been exhausted, she fell straight to sleep.<br />
<br />
A couple hours passed and James came into the apartment, it was dark, so it meant that she was asleep, perfect, he thought. He put down the items from the store on the counter and walked around looking for Wren. Finally finding her on the couch, he sat slowly on the edge, so as not to stir her. ~Time to test my theory.~ He thought as he breathed slowly, hoping it would work. &quot;Don't wake up no matter what I do.&quot; He said aloud, after a moment he pushed her, not hard but hard enough to where anyone would wake up. <br />
<br />
Nothing, not even a sigh or a moan, nothing, just continuance. &quot;Yes, this is awesome, no matter what she follows my orders. Lets try more.....&quot; He paused, thinking for a moment. &quot;Stand up but don't wake up.&quot; She complied, her eyes still closed, she stood still in front of the couch, James smirked. He pulled at the straps to her dress, pulling it down to her feet, leaving her completely naked just standing there. James through the dress into the corner. He walked around her, admiring her beauty, he slapped her ass, and squeezed one of her breasts, teasing the nipple, not one reaction.<br />
<br />
James stood there, proud that he had Wren under his complete control, literally. But that was mentally, what about the physicality of this potion, it did effect her before, but to what extent. &quot;Have blonde hair.&quot; Instantly her hair brightened and became a bleach blonde. &quot;Amazing, have bigger breasts.&quot; Her breasts grew a cup size. James had a hard on, it was perfect, every man's dream. But his mind was conflicted, it was his friend...justifying it he though that he could always order him to be Will again...but he had to keep that a secret. &quot;Back to Wren.&quot; She was brown hair and c-cups again.<br />
<br />
James smirked, the power was all his and he was going to enjoy it while it lasted. &quot;Wake up, but act completely like a dog, no memory of Will or Wren for right now.&quot; Wren's eyes opened up wide as she dropped to all fours, she started panting as she saw James, her perfect bubble gum tongue hung out of her mouth as she held up a hand for James to pet her as she padded around on her knees. James obliged her, petting her on the head. She looked funny, but it was also hot at the same time. She walked away from James, giving him a full view of her bald beaver and ass hole. Her breasts just hung there as she walked like a dog. James sat on the couch, causing Wren to come over to him, she put her hands on his chest and began to sniff his face as she licked him, she got up onto the couch with some effort, laying her head on James' lap.<br />
<br />
James smiled, wiping the slobber from his face. He place a hand on her warm naked back. &quot;Now, what should I do with you my beauty....&quot;</p>
