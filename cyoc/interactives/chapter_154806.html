<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jonathan &quot;slept&quot; far longer in a single night, than ever had in his life. Of course, having no senses and no body, what else was a disembodied brain in a jar to do?<br />
<br />
He was suddenly wide awake as his &quot;eyes&quot; immediately opened into a well-lit room. His mind still groggy but his sight was clear as day. There was no eye-sleepiness for Johnny. For he didn&#39;t have eyes. All he had was a camera, which forced him to look and observe. And what he was looking at, was a room full of jars with brains. And his now dead 11year old boy&#39;s body, and a live donkey body lying on two separate tables in the middle of the room. Both bodies with their skulls open, with nothing inside them but pitch blackness. <br />
<br />
He saw a woman back up after plugging his brain into his temporary audio and visual feed. <br />
<br />
Looking up at the camera, she said, &quot;mow, you&#39;ve had 12 hours to recover and have the donkey&#39;s instinctual brain parts mesh with your human brain&#39;s core. You&#39;re still alive, so it appears to have worked this far. The next step: placing you inside that donkey&#39;s skull.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, she reached over and grabbed the jar containing Jonathan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Please! I don&#39;t want the body of a donkey! I just wanna go home as myself! Please!&quot; He was unable to communicate any of his thoughts to this mad woman. And unfortunately, even if he wasn&#39;t going to be placed inside the donkey, he would never be going home as &quot;himself&quot; again. At least, not in bodily form. <br />
<br />
Johnny could only watch helplessly and in silence as she set his container on the same table as the big ugly hairy beast. She then reached in, grabbed the brain, and placed it inside the thing&#39;s braincase!  <br />
<br />
The feeding tube was still attached to his former jar and still sucking up whatever fluid that was. Then she brought that slimy-looking gel stuff over to his jar, and emptied the contents into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I demonstrated and taught you yesterday, this gel-like stuff came from the CDC as am experimental medical technology. It encourages cell growth and cooperation between different body parts. In this case, theoretically, it will fuse your brain with the donkey&#39;s. It will create brand new neural pathways and connections. It&#39;ll connect your visual perception to the donkey&#39;s eyeballs, and likewise, the auditory percetion to it&#39;s ears.<br />
<br />
Now, those are two functions I have replaced of your old brain. The auditory section of a donkey brain is much larger than for humans. They can interpret more sound at higher frequencies than humans can. In other words: they have better hearing. I had to turn down the mic&#39;s reception quite a bit, otherwise, I would be sounding to you like I&#39;m speaking really loudly. <br />
<br />
Now that your brain has been bombarded with the DNA from the donkey&#39;s brain bits, your human brain can now accept the donkey&#39;s DNA much more readily. Even though there is a lot more work to be done by the gel from last night&#39;s procedure, this part will go much quicker. And you won&#39;t even have to go unconscious. You can remain fully aware the entire time as you look at yourself. <br />
<br />
In the mean time, I&#39;ll give you yet another your of your brain&#39;s new home.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then grabbed his camera, and went all around the body. A close-up of his unbrushed non-human bright yellow teeth that looked just disgusting. All four legs and hooves. His tail. His large black puckered asshole hidden in his large rump. His humungous black leathery balls that wobble around almost like hellow, and his huge long male girth. <br />
<br />
She then gave the 11year old boy a crash course in donkey anatomy and diet. She explained he will now be an herbivore, and grass should taste the same to him as it does to any grass-eating animal like cows, horses, and other donkeys. <br />
<br />
She then showed a humiliating video of a donkey sniffing the rear end of another donkey. It&#39;s penis come slithering outward and downward. And the male bucking up onto the rearend of the female he was previously sniffing out. Both braying loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, this is all perfectly normal, natural behavior. This is how donkeys have sex and procreate. You&#39;ll be finding your own mate soon enough, whether your intellectually willing or not. The donkey&#39;s instinct to breed will overwhelm your human mind&#39;s ability to control your body at that point.<br />
<br />
And same with eating and drinking, btw. You&#39;ll be in a field much like this one,&quot; she said, pointing at the television with a random donkey grazing, &quot;and this will become your life. You will be unable to resist grazing, as, again, the donkey instincts will kick in to ensure your survival.&quot;<br />
<br />
The video then cut to a scene of several animals, donkeys, cows, and horses alike, all dipping their large amounts into the same trough to drink the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is how you&#39;ll end up drinking as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she was speaking, the gel in his head was working. Faster and faster. He started noticing he could feel himself breathing! He could feel breath coming in and out of his snout! He could feel tingling coursing up and down his new old spine as his brain was making its connections to his new body. <br />
<br />
All the sudden, he was able to move a leg. A right leg. He was still viewing this from the camera and watched, while feeling and making his front right leg move!<br />
<br />
He could feel his tail come alive and start kicking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Almost finished!&quot; She said as she grabbed the top of his new skull, ready to trap Jonathan&#39;s brain inside the pitch blackness of the large equine head. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll go blind and deaf for a couple of second again, so just bear with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then unplugged his brain cord from his visual and auditory centers of his brain, just as they made their connections to his new donkey retinas and inner ears. <br />
<br />
He then felt pressure at the top of his skull, as she completely enclosed his brain in the skull. The gel did it&#39;s work there, too, as it sutured the skull shut, trapping Johnny inside for good. <br />
<br />
He felt his hooves most of all, heavy, hard, and unyielding at the ends of his arms...or rather, legs now. He would miss having hands. Most of all, miss knowing what it&#39;s like to have fingers and how to work them. All he will ever know are hooves. <br />
<br />
His sense of smell, then his hearing, then his new vision came into focus. He opened his new, large, black, heavy eyes and took his first look through the. The colors were much faded and reduces. More washed out. He was more near-sighted, and his vision was much poorer. Less sharp and less focused. <br />
<br />
He attempted to speak, and for the first time  in over a day, he was able to vocalize a noise. Just not the noise he was expecting and thinking of. He was thinking of uttering the phrase &quot;please, let me go home!&quot; Instead, all he heard escaping from his lips, were a weak &quot;heeeee hhhaawww.&quot;<br />
<br />
His ears perked up. He FELT them perk up, twitch, and move! &quot;Hee Hhhaaww hhhee Hhhaaww hhhee Hhhaaww,&quot; he tried to speak again. <br />
<br />
With rising panic, he thought and tried to say aloud: &quot;i can&#39;t talk!&quot; &quot;Hhhee hhaaaww!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He wanted to stand up, and for a moment, he almost thought of his human form. Instead, he rolled off the table, and landed on all fours with four &quot;clops&quot; in rapid succession. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhee Hhhaaww hhhee Hhhaaww hheee Hhhaaww&quot; Johnny brayed as he realized he would now be relegated to all fours.<br />
<br />
He could taste his large, swollen, oversized sour mouth, and thought of those teeth! His brain was now experiencing the taste of those plaque / germ-ridden sour yellow unbrushed donkey teeth! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhee Hhhaaww hhheeee Hhhaaww hhheeee Hhhaaww,&quot; he started sobbing. He was stuck standing on all fours like a common animal in front of a person he just met the day before. He can&#39;t speak, his mouth tastes awefully foul, he wanted to go home, and his human body is now dead!<br />
<br />
&quot;As for your body, I&#39;ll put the rest of the donkey&#39;s brains I didn&#39;t use, stuff it inside your old skull, loosly suture it shut, then toss it off a cliff. When /if your body is found, everyone will believe your dead. Your friends, family, etc. It&#39;ll give them some closure, and you&#39;ll go on to live your new life as a donkey. They&#39;ll never have to know you&#39;re stuck as an embarrassing, disgusting, lowly creature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny started getting mad, and he wanted to lash out at this woman. But a part of his (new) brain wouldn&#39;t allow him to! Donkeys are generally pretty passive creatures, and only lash out if their lives are immediately in danger. Intellectually, Johnny wanted to strike her down. But his human intellect has less control than she explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have the entire prosecute recorded, and now know how to perform it. I&#39;ll present it to my University professors, get my medical degree, and go on to practice medicine and take amazing vacations every year.<br />
<br />
As for you. Well. You get all the free grass your new donkey heart desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three large men then entered the room, one with a bridle. With a sinking feeling, Jeff back away and started braying. They quickly and efficiently for the bridle over his head, and began walking him up a small flight of steps to the outside. Jonny sobbing the entire way, getting one last glimpse of his 11year old smooth little handsome boyish body, as the woman stuffed the donkey brain bits into the skull. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee hhaaww,&quot; he sadly brayed as they tugged his reign again and his body instinctually obeyed. Betraying his refusal to go anywhere. <br />
<br />
Once outside the manor house where they broke in just a mere day ago, his body stopped as he smelled fresh grass. His belly rumbled, and he felt hungry. Then, against his will, he dipped his face to the ground to attempt to eat. But the man holding his reign cruelly tugged on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on a second here, Hank. This big feller is hungry. That miss down there, said he hasn&#39;t been nourished properly in a few days, and this is the first time he took to his feet. We have a few hour drive ahead of us. Let the big guy eat his fill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, alright. But if he runs away, that&#39;s on you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man dropped the reigns, undid the bridle, and let Johnny free.<br />
<br />
Johnny attempted to by, just as the man had predicted. Instead, he dropped his head to the ground, opened his mouth, let his long slimy tongue come out, and his enormous yellow buck came down as his tongue brought in a clump of the green inhumanly edible fare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! What are you doing? Run!&quot; His body refused to comply! He was stuck calmly eating grass as a donkey on all fours. Unable to tear himself away from his duty. He started sobbing again while he involuntarily continued biting at the grass with his head lowered, and chewing the slimy green paste. He couldn&#39;t even so much as bray to show his frustration. His donkey half of his brain was fully in control now. <br />
<br />
There he was, in the front yard of this manor house uncontrollably eating the grass for a half an hour, before one of the men said &quot;ok, he&#39;s had enough now. It should sustain him for a couple of hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
James, meanwhile, was raging against his stupid oversized clumsy body to move. But it wouldn&#39;t budge. The man came over to lift his head, and fitted him with that bridle again. Grabbing the reigns, he led James the donkey towards a waiting truck with a horse trailer attached.<br />
<br />
James finally regained SOME control over his legs. But not enough. Only enough to slightly resist, making his footsteps harder and heavier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, boy! Let&#39;s go! You have work to do tommorrow, which means you need to eat and get some rest early tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sick feeling, he heard his left front good make a loud sharp &quot;CLOP&quot; noise that sounded so much different, louder, and heavier that the footsteps of full-grown men. Nevermind how light and quiet his own footsteps would have been. <br />
<br />
&quot;CLOP&quot; goes his left front hoof. Before he knew it, he was &quot;CLIP CLOPPING&quot; his way up the metal ramp into the dark, crowded interior of a horse trailer. With a &quot;BANG,&quot; the men closed him in, and trapped him. Much like how his brain is trapped inside the skull of a donkey and nobody knew it but him, the woman who did it, and possibly these two men.</p>
