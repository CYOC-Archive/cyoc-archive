<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After they cleaned up their little role-play (leaving Felia&#39;s wet pile of clothing on the floor), Jeff turned to Gabe&#39;s succubus body, which by now had returned to normal, no longer looking like Felia&#39;s clone.<br />
<br />
He hesitantly spoke up. &quot;So like… Jess, you know how she looks like, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess, the person in class, whom Gabe accused Jeff of having horny thoughts about.<br />
<br />
The succubus body still hadn&#39;t fully recovered from Jeff&#39;s little display earlier, and still looked a little impressed, or intimidated. She held her 6 arms in a shy pose, some behind her back, others holding another arm, and looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda? I did taste her, so I can probably just… uh, use that, I think. …Why are you asking, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned maliciously, &quot;I want to make some more &#39;evidence&#39; videos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe reacted to this with a little pout, looking uncertain. &quot;But it feels wrong, though…&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff pressed on, &quot;What does? Weren&#39;t you the one who wanted to make sure she knows her place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe looked thoughtful at this. &quot;Well, yes, I did, but… hmmmm…&quot;<br />
<br />
She puts a finger to her mouth, and contemplated the idea.<br />
<br />
Jeff observed her various gloved hands making various thinking poses. It was honestly cute, and hot, knowing that she had this much ability, yet here she looked almost silly, using them all only for emoting.<br />
<br />
However, Jeff was surprised as she spoke next, out of her own initiative.<br />
<br />
Gabe raised a finger, and looked excited, &quot;What if… we did it at her place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeff asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
Gabe clapped one pair of hands. &quot;Yes! It&#39;s gotta be like… realistic and stuff, like, it can&#39;t be at my house, cuz then it&#39;s very confusing and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked as he thought about this, and shrugged, already happy that she wasn&#39;t against the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, do you know where she lives? Her address?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe then waved off the question, and rolled her eyes. &quot;Well, <I>duh</I>. Not <I>only</I> do I have all of them in a little booklet that draggy keeps,&quot; she said, as she gestured over to her dragon body, &quot;But also, my pussy catches their smell from miles away, so for a late night snack, just pick someone I like, and fly, like… on autopilot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sending a glance at the succubus&#39; pussy (currently hidden under a fake illusion of modesty), he nodded. He sent a glance at the dragon body as well, which currently was right in the middle of shoving her phone back into her pussy pocket again.<br />
<br />
He believed her, the idea of her being able to catch onto anyone&#39;s smell from miles away. But he wasn&#39;t sure if the idea scared him, or made him aroused.<br />
<br />
Gabe suddenly exclaimed, &quot;Ohhhh, I think she&#39;s out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Gabe again, which currently was looking through the wall, with two fists on her wide hips.<br />
<br />
He asked for some clarification. &quot;Sorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked back at him with a giddy smile, &quot;I think she&#39;s not at home, I can&#39;t smell her right now, she only lives a mile from here, and with her smell gone, she is too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring the fact that the &quot;smell&quot; that she was probably tracking was not sensed with a normal &quot;nose&quot;, he pressed on. &quot;So… we could come over to her house right now, and do the thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Wait, we gotta take a camera with us, of course…&quot;<br />
<br />
As if on cue, the dragon body unfurled her wings, and flapped them once.<br />
<br />
Gabe then walked them out of the room, onto a balcony. Once again, Jeff was lifted by her strong succubus arms, and then they took off to the skies.<br />
<br />
Gabe started talking while they flew, somehow being audible over the wind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So like, she really loves anal! She&#39;s really into it! And is like… also into girls and stuff? She probably didn&#39;t have many of them before, with the way she ate me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Jeff wasn&#39;t so much as &quot;frozen&quot; in Gabe&#39;s arms, he was pretty stiff, and clenched his whole body, the reality of being held a few hundred meters above the ground drilling into his head. All there was between the open air and a certain fall, were two arms locked under his armpits, and 4 more currently gesturing haphazardly, at whatever story she was telling.<br />
<br />
Within a minute or so, they had Jessica&#39;s house in sight.<br />
<br />
When the house came into view, Gabe spotted the absence of a car, and whooped. &quot;I knew it! She&#39;s not around for miles!&quot;<br />
<br />
They started to slow down, and descend, but Gabe continued, &quot;So okay, like, she also has a lot of toys, I KNOW she has a lot of toys. Ohhhh! What if she stole mine? Then you&#39;d come in and give her the real deal!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she kept on rambling and held Jeff in midair, her powerful flaps keeping them hovering, her dragon body was finding an entrance, an open window, and eventually found an open upstairs window.<br />
<br />
She then repositioned to the front door, which was soon opened from within by the dragon body.<br />
<br />
As she released Jeff, and entered the house, she kept on rambling, &quot;Her bathroom is upstairs, I know she keeps her toys there, she has to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but exclaim a chuckle. &quot;You&#39;re really into this, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe scoffed. &quot;Well, Jessica, no, &#39;Jelly Jessie&#39; <I>knew</I> what was coming for her when she messed with <I>me</I>, I just want to give her some little tiny revenge. I really wanna see her face when I send this to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this last comment, Jeff felt like he had to restrain her enthusiasm a bit, and put a hand on her shoulder. She looked at him, confused.<br />
<br />
He spoke hesitantly, trying not to ruin the mood, but also trying not to let her shoot off again. &quot;Uh… maybe not that. Maybe wait like… until she becomes an issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
She frowned, and her voice rose in volume, &quot;Why that? Why not release it right now? She deserves it, and it would become a viral hit at school! Everyone can finally see what a bitch she is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff pressed on. &quot;Like, uh, I don&#39;t want to <I>have to</I> hurt her… until she hurts me, that kinda deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe made an &quot;oh&quot; face. &quot;Well… Alright then! Yeah! What you said!&quot;<br />
<br />
They entered Jessica&#39;s bathroom, and Gabe instantly began to usher him and the &quot;camerawoman&quot; around.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we can maybe like… have you come in, here, and then you discover her here…&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe already started to turn her body into Jessica&#39;s, with clothes and all, while Jeff sighed and went along. She really was perfect for him.</p>
