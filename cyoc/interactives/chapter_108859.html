<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During freshman lunch; Eric, with the help of the table concealing his actions was running his hand up and down Frieda thigh. Smiling as he too is giving the redheaded were-panthress a tease for what they and Spencer will be doing later.<br />
“All right Eric,” Frieda grinning; “let me finish my chili.”<br />
“I guess its bean week,” Eric chuckles; “Enchiladas yesterday, chili today. Care to wager its three bean salad tomorrow?”<br />
“I hope not,” Brian walker approaching them with his lunch; “mind if I join?”<br />
<br />
Eric just shrugs as he looks at some texts Spencer managed to send to him and Frieda during the morning. Brian taking that as a yes plunks his tray across from them and joins them.<br />
“Something on your mind;” Eric doing his best to be friendly. While Eric and Brian had a class or two together, they never became friends; with Julie cheating on Eric and Eric catching her with the were-otter in front of him, it was understandable that Eric would still have some animosity towards the person.<br />
“Just some family problems,” Brian sighing; “it doesn’t help when the wer-mer and wer-otter rep are involved.”<br />
Frieda perks up when she heard that. Knowing she was going to be the next wer-panther rep on the council; “and here I thought Julie’s latest pathetic attempt at revenge was going to be today&#39;s topic.”<br />
“So Julie went after you,” Brian looking surprised; “at least my warning did some good,” Brian sighing.<br />
“Julie tried to email me pretending she was someone else,” Frieda looking at her phone; “oh my dad just sent a text. Sheriff Cooper is about to issue a warrant to seize Julie Stovall’s computer under the pretense of possible witness tampering/intimidation.”<br />
“And so ends her one and only avenue of attack,” Eric smiling as he shovels a spoon full of chili into his mouth; “what is it you wanted to talk about Brain?”<br />
“Do either of you know where I can get a new cell phone,” Brian asking; “I broke my last one. If my mom finds out she’ll be pissed. Plus I’m supposed to start an after school job soon. Cleaning up after elder council sessions.”<br />
<br />
Frieda chokes on her chili; “how did you get a job with the elder council?”<br />
“Andrew Curry the wer-mer rep,” Brian eating his lunch; “he is my god father. Plus this job is also supposed to be a punishment for declaring my dad dead and other things.”<br />
“What other things;” Eric only partly interested in the subject matter.<br />
“You remember that knock out blonde that was picking me up last week,” Brian speaking; “she is the sheriffs cousin. And she was trying to get me started as a gigolo.”<br />
“So you got clients,” Eric looking disgusted; “that’s why you need a new phone, to contact them.”<br />
“No,” Brian lying; “I need a new phone so I can call my godfather up to give him my new contact info.” But Brian does think ‘but I do need to contact Betty to let her know not to reach me on my old contact number. That number is hot, what with my mom taking my phone away.”<br />
“Whatever,” Eric losing interest in the conversation; “I’m sure you can get a new phone at any electronics store. Just pick on up after school.”<br />
“Can’t grounded,” Brian stating; “would either of you be able to get one for me?”<br />
“NO;” both Eric and Frieda say in unison.<br />
<br />
Brian just sighs; he grabs his lunch tray and walks to the trash to empty the tray and leave the cafeteria. Eric and Frieda still eating; Eric is the first to speak.<br />
“Despite the fact that Julie, was dumped by him,” Eric commenting; “I don’t trust Brian.”<br />
“Well he was helpful yesterday;” Frieda answering.<br />
“Yes,” Eric finishing his chili; “but that was because we had a common enemy. Julie.”<br />
“What do you think will happen now that Julie’s computer is taken away;” Frieda asking.<br />
“Don’t know,” Eric texting Nate what is for lunch; “But if she manages to find a way to get out of house arrest without being caught. She better not try a physical confrontation.”<br />
Frieda grins; “One wer-mer against two wer-panthers and a hybrid were that knows martial arts. Yep Julie would be sushi before she could react.”<br />
<br />
Eric chuckles as he once again teases Frieda by placing his hand on her thigh. Frieda smiling takes her hand and traces a trail from Eric’s thigh and stops as she gently cradles Eric’s groin.<br />
“You know,” Eric feeling aroused; “we are going to have to learn some self-control eventually. We don’t want to get caught doing something inappropriate in public.”<br />
“True,” Frieda removing her hand from Eric’s crotch; “but I just can’t wait for tonight.”<br />
“Same here,” Eric smiles; “and I sense Spencer is eager for the day to end as well.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Spencer who was in her final class before lunch was fidgeting in her seat; she could feel her arousal build as she senses Eric and Frieda’s teasing each other. ‘Oh you two are going to get a serious dose of tongue action from me.’<br />
“Spencer,” The teacher speaking up; “are you paying attention? Do you want a detention after school?”<br />
Spencer snapped out of her thoughts to look at the teacher; “no sir.”<br />
“Then pay attention,” the teacher responds as he goes back to his lesson.<br />
<br />
Spencer looking at the class clock; she noted that there was about ten minutes left before lunch. ‘Ten long minutes’, Spencer thought; ‘I can’t wait for school to end today.’ Spencer along with Eric were to be inducted into the were-panther pride Frieda was a member in. With Frieda doing the induction ceremony at her father’s estate; Spencer was both a mix of excitement and trepidation. With her and Eric being unique in regards to their fursona; the three were concerned that there will be were’s fighting for their attention and affection.<br />
<br />
Spencer looking at the clock again sees that there is five minutes remaining. Making an effort to write down notes so as not to get in trouble from the teacher; Spencer recalls what her father said. ‘if the were-panther gatherings are anything like the pack meetings your mother and I attend, you will be asked by other were’s if you are interested in sex with them.’ Spencer smiles; ‘I may be bi-sexual, but that doesn’t mean I’m into swinging like you and mom are dad. I’m not interested in anyone but Eric and Frieda.’<br />
<br />
The bell rings signaling the end of class and Spencer is one of the first out of the class room. Heading to her locker, she passes Eric and Frieda as they head to their afternoon classes. Spencer heads to the cafeteria to eat lunch. Smelling the aroma before she got there; Spencer could tell it was chili for lunch.</p>
