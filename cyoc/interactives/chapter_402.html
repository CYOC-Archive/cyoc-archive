<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night was definitely odd for Francisco. He woke up several times feeling himself stiff and tense, tingling with heat 
<br>
 and sensation, only to relax again after mere moments. The normal nocturnal would have been hell if he actually felt 
<br>
 tired. There wasn't much to be felt, as his changed body, now part of Marco's, didn't seem to be capable of getting tired, 
<br>
 at least not from being &quot;awake.&quot; Whenever his body lost erection, his senses seemed to be dulled, and he was barely aware 
<br>
 of what was going on around them, and found it easy to slip back into sleep, despite not being tired. 
<br>

<br>
 As morning arrived, Marco groggily threw his legs over the bed and stood up. His fingers rubbed the sleep from his eyes, 
<br>
 and he grabbed a pair of boxer briefs from the drawer next to the bed and put them on. Walking slowly over to the 
<br>
 bathroom, he opened the door and pulled the waistband of his underwear down... 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco awoke to a feeling at the base of his body that he'd never experienced before. Warmth was spreading seem to be 
<br>
 pooling around his feet, and he had this sense of imminent release some sort. Below him was the large white bowl of the 
<br>
 toilet, and he realized what was happening. Before he could say anything, he felt the warmth shoot up and out of his body. 
<br>
 He couldn't quell the thoughts of disgust that he had, but in reality, it didn't feel bad. In fact, it felt very good. 
<br>
 The feeling of release flowed though his whole body, and the warmth made him think of having sex with Marco, and how it 
<br>
 felt to climax during sex, though this obviously wasn't it. As the last of the warm liquid left his body, he decided it 
<br>
 was time to let Marco remember where he was. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Marco! MARCO! Hey! Did you forget I was down here?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Marco blinked in temporary surprise and quickly grabbed a piece of toilet paper and rubbed his dick, not wanting to shake 
<br>
 his lover around too much, feeling bad that he had gone to the bathroom and not remembered who was hanging around down 
<br>
 there. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hey, don't look so shocked. It actually wasn't that bad. It really felt pretty good.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Marco smiled down at his limp penis and gave it an affectionate pat. &quot;Well, if you liked it, then I won't feel bad for it. 
<br>
 How was your night.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Weird. I don't know whether I like being your dick or not, love. The feeling is... hard to explain. Didn't really 
<br>
 sleep, but then, I don't feel like I really needed to. What was it like for you?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You wouldn't believe what it feels like when your thing moves around on it's own. It's almost like someone's always go 
<br>
 their hands on it. Erotic.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 As he spoke, Marco began to get hard, and Francisco could feel himself stiffen, blood pumping by the beat of Marco's heart 
<br>
 through his body. Marco reached down automatically and started to rub his lover/cock between his fingers, and the feelings 
<br>
 he got were unusually strong. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco would have told him to stop if it hadn't felt so good. He could feel Marco's fingers pushing up and around his 
<br>
 body, sending waves of pleasure through his entire being. Marco could feel these same waves as usual, only magnified. He 
<br>
 walked from the bathroom and laid on his bed, pumping harder and reaching for immediate climax. Francisco could feel 
<br>
 warmth radiating again from where his feet should have been, but this time it felt different. It wasn't just warmth, but a 
<br>
 building sensation that pushed at his senses, peeling away at rational thought, and leading only to the hunger for feeling. 
<br>
 As Marco pumped and came closer to climax, Francisco's mind was temporarily lost and he was for brief moment, nothing more 
<br>
 than cock, in mind, feeling and form. When Marco's climaxed, however, that perspective changed. He could feel the warmth 
<br>
 and pressure erupt up through his body, wave after wave of pleasure rocketing through him. He could feel in a strange 
<br>
 pleasure and! 
<br>
 pain combination where Marco's frantic pounding had chaffed him. Marco felt like he was in release for ever, but 
<br>
 Francisco's pleasure only lasted for the first few pulses, not benefiting from the endorphins released in Marco's brain. 
<br>

<br>
 He felt his body bouncing, releasing the rest of the spunk into Marco's abdomen, and could see in the mirror as it was 
<br>
 happening. He watched, startled at what was taking place. Marco's body was changing, and it started to look familiar. 
<br>
 The familiarity become more and more clear with each of the finishing pulses. Marco grew shorter from his 6'3, losing 
<br>
 height with each pulse. His muscles began to contract in on themselves also, each pulse taking a bit of size, though the 
<br>
 definition stayed. Francisco could feel himself growing, and as he watched in the mirror, he noticed that he was not 
<br>
 getting hard, but that Marco's dick/his body was in fact getting larger. As he watched, he realized why it was so 
<br>
 familiar. Francisco would have been wide eyed, had he had eyes. As the last pulse of Marco's orgasm ended, Francisco 
<br>
 could see on the bed not Marco as he was, but his own body. His lover now looked just like Francisco did normally, and 
<br>
 Francisco was his own dick.</p>
