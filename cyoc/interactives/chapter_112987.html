<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning after the latest Animalia Ambassadoria began much the same way many days began in the Wesley household. The bedside alarm clock, sitting on a stand between two twin beds went off with a steady chirping which soon awoke the two huskies from their slumber. Both Sarah and Malice sat up and gave a short yawn as they began to start their day, as they always did. Adding the additional bed to the room had taken a bit of effort and had forced some of Sarah&#39;s other furniture to be removed in order for it to fit, but neither Malice nor Sarah would have had it any other way. It let them truly feel like sisters, even though Malice had been born as a dog and Sarah as a normal human. That felt good to both of them.<br />
<br />
The two carefully made their way to a dresser that was against the wall closest to Malice&#39;s bed. Malice arrived first and was quick to open one drawer and help her sister get dressed. Malice had always been the most comfortable with being naked, as she&#39;d never needed clothes before being uplifted, but even Sarah had to admit that it was more comfortable to sleep in the nude. Their fur easily kept the two husky sisters warm and even most comfortable pieces of sleepwear held additional heat while they slept, particularly if they slept under any blankets.  The clothes that they wore during the day could also leave them feeling warm, but they made sure it was comfortable enough that they wouldn&#39;t overheat.<br />
<br />
They were initially fairly quiet as they got dressed, but both soon heard a noise that had become rather routine over the past few days. It was the sound of Sarah&#39;s birth mother and Malice&#39;s adoptive mother, Julia Wesley, dry heaving in the master bathroom. That only served to remind both sisters that Julia was pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will mom&#39;s morning sickness last?&quot; Malice asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few months, I think,&quot; Sarah answered as she pulled up the pair of panties she&#39;d wear for the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;ll be big sisters,&quot; Malice commented again.<br />
<br />
Julia&#39;s pregnancy had been a hit with everyone, and both Sarah and Malice were actually happy to hear about that. Sarah, because she remembered wanting a baby brother or sister at one point and Malice in the hopes that Julia&#39;s pregnancy would mean that Julia loosen up some of the rules that Julia and Thomas had set for Malice and Sarah regarding their dating habits. The only thing that wasn&#39;t liked was that Julia never told them that she and Thomas had decided to try for more children of their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sarah nodded, &quot;Mom will have puppies and we&#39;ll probably get some chance to help take care of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And will be good practice for you and Travis,&quot; Malice said with a smile, &quot;that way... you&#39;ll be ready when you two get to having puppies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a bit soon for that,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;Don&#39;t you think? I mean... yeah Travis and I are mates, but we have agreed that we&#39;d wait until after we&#39;re through High School at least before we get to that stuff. I even have my own prescription for birth control pills to make sure I don&#39;t get myself pregnant should Travis and I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it,&quot; Malice grumbled as the fastened her bra behind her and looked toward their closet for the rest of their clothes from the day. Sarah did notice this and looked over to her sister. Malice continued, &quot;and when I get my mate... I&#39;ll probably be taking those pills to, so that I can join the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Malice?&quot; Sarah asked, sounding a bit concerned. &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
She knew that Malice had formed something of a thing for the boy from Project Phoenix who had become a wolf based Animalian. While Malice had practically thrown herself at Simon at their first meeting, she managed to control herself quite well during the Animalia Ambassadoria interviews, though Sarah noted that Malice did remain fairly flirtatious attitude with Simon while Animalia&#39;s ambassadors talked with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Malice sighed, &quot;Just thinking over some of the stuff going on that Simon mentioned and how it relates to us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah was quiet as they put on their outerwear for the day while Malice continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s dreamy... he looks strong, and he wants to be a cop too!&quot; Malice said with a smile, &quot;and we hit it off at yesterday&#39;s broadcast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw,&quot; Sarah nodded, &quot;and you did quite well. See what happens when you&#39;re not practically throwing yourself at people?&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice ignored that comment for the moment, as that didn&#39;t appear to be an issue. Simon actually seemed to like her for her forwardness and honesty. He&#39;d been friendly to her and they got along fairly well. However, their conversation had also revealed that he&#39;d gotten A LOT of attention from the other uplifted canines at school. Malice, Sarah, and Travis hadn&#39;t been able to see that, as they were all Freshmen while Simon was a Senior, but Simon had shared with Malice that information.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are getting along well,&quot; Malice commented, &quot;but he also told me that he&#39;s been getting a lot of attention, much of which he really isn&#39;t that interested in... or that the interest that is in him isn&#39;t very serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be a good thing for you?&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;if he likes you and you like him... you&#39;d have a shot at getting your own mate. Is that not what you wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Malice spoke, &quot;but some of the others may be rather aggressive with regard to dealing with rivals. One is supposed to be a bully or a former one and another is supposedly the Senior class &quot;queen&quot; and neither would take kindly to a freshman having interest in him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah only blinked while Malice continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And another appears to be something of a romantic triangle already with her courting males almost more interested in fighting each other than actually courting her,&quot; Malice finished. &quot;I want a mate of my own... one I can love and support and will do the same for me. Someone who will raise puppies with me in the future. Someone else I can work with with the police... but I don&#39;t want to start a fight to get it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that might come if you wish to court Simon?&quot; Sarah asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the fear,&quot; Malice answered. &quot;And I&#39;ve been thinking over some way to try and prevent that... most of what I&#39;ve come up with has been to try and talk to those involved... but that hits snags in that, they&#39;d see ME as a rival and could fight... The rest is the fact that they&#39;re mostly Seniors, so they don&#39;t have any classes with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Travis and I could help AFTER school,&quot; Sarah offered, &quot;after all, we are mates already and most everyone knows that by now, so they won&#39;t see me as a rival, and AFTER school, won&#39;t be an issue, as everyone gets out together. We could then see as to what may be done to get everyone to accept whatever decision Simon makes with regard to who he decides to court and so on. We could even explain that Animalia cannot afford to have everyone fighting over mates and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d help?&quot; Malice looked over and spoke with a more opportunistic tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;you helped me and Travis and you&#39;re my sister. It&#39;s only fair that I help you and give you a shot at happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice wagged her tail and hugged her sister.</p>
