<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah was walking home from work when a glint of something gold caught her eye. She bent over to pick it up, it was a ring. She put it on knowing that something good would happen on her birthday.<br />
When she got home she opened the door, went inside.<br />
&quot;Surprise.&quot; everyone yelled after the lights went on in Sarah&#39;s apartment. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the ... is going on?&quot; Sarah shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;We thought we would throw you a surprise 40th birthday party. I didn&#39;t think you would mind.&quot; Julie says, softly lowering her head as if she was in trouble. <br />
<br />
She turns and walks away. Great just what I wanted a party to celebrate the fact that I am old, alone and have never had a good day in my life. No, that is wrong I had two good days. Both were when my kids were born, Bobby 13 and Missy 15. <br />
<br />
Later that night it came time to blow out the candles on the birthday cake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on mom you can do it!&quot; Bobby said. <br />
<br />
Sarah takes a deep breathe, thinks in her head how great being young is and blows out her candles. Suddenly the lights go out, a reddish tint fills the room. <br />
<br />
Missy screams, &quot;What was that!&quot; and runs to her mom, Bobby laughs and continues eating his cake. &quot;Hey mom what&#39;s that ring for?&quot; Asked Missy.<br />
&quot;Oh this, its just a ring I found. You can have it sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then just as suddenly as they went off, the come back on. <br />
<br />
Sarah laughs, &quot;What else can go wrong?&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone laughs and enjoys their time at the party. <br />
<br />
So the weird happening was forgotten and everyone including Sarah had fun during the rest of the party. The party ended shortly after two and all the guests left. Bobby, Missy and Sarah cleaned up and went to bed just before four in the morning. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a night, I am glad my kids love me. That was a great party, even though I am so old.&quot; Sarah muttered as she turned off the bedside lamp and fluttered to sleep. <br />
<br />
Sarah slept incredibly well, better than she had in years. <br />
<br />
Seven in the morning the alarm went off and Sarah jumped out of bed and into the shower. She knew Bobby had to be at school extra early this morning so she put a little quickness in her step. She turned on the water and went to pick out an outfit for work today. Sarah for some reason felt hip, more alive today, so she picked an outfit that was a little out of place to her. The dark red low cut suit was something she had loved to wear when she was a young executive and today she felt young again. She muttered to herself - why did I complain about turning forty, it&#39;s feels like I am 30. She giggled to herself as she chose some sexier underwear than the plain stuff she usually picked out. <br />
<br />
During the shower as she lathered herself up, she swore her body felt more firm thinner. Her hips and stomach felt firmer and the little pouch of skin from the birth of her kids felt smaller almost gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta love diets!&quot; she hummed to herself as she stepped out of the shower. <br />
<br />
She stood in front of the mirror staring at the woman she was. Her face seemed fresher and more alive. She studied herself closely and smiled big. Something had changed but Sarah didn&#39;t care how or why she just liked it. <br />
<br />
&quot;My goodness, I look younger - a lot younger - about 30. My hair is blond with absolutely no shades of gray in it.&quot; It was amazing. Sarah admired her self for a couple of minutes and then heard Bobby call for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, we have to leave come on hurry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Coming&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah grabbed her out fit and slipped it on in record time, the clothes all fit my much better. She hurried out to the car where Bobby and Missy were waiting impatiently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, did you dye your hair today.&quot; Missy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I also used that wrinkle cream you bought for me it works great.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. You look years younger.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah dropped both kids off and left them with big hugs and went to work. At work, everyone was complientmenting her and even a few of the newer young guys checked her out as she bent down to pick up some papers. She smiled, her walk had changed too, gone was the old &quot;gotta move&quot; walk and a new &quot;look at me&quot; walk appeared. Her whole attitude changed she felt alive and she loved it. Thomas, her partner for many years, even &quot;checked here out.&quot; He seemed so old, but his friendship meant so much to her that she went with him to lunch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, you are beautiful.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, but how come you didn&#39;t come to the party last night - I mean you live next door.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know but I wasn&#39;t sure you wanted me to come.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thomas, I like you and I also share a birthday with you, how could I not want you to be there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. I just want to be with you. I wished last night that you and me could have met when we were younger and then we could have married and fell in love.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I never even knew you wanted that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I should have told you earlier.&quot; <br />
<br />
After work Thomas asked Sarah if she wanted to pick up some dinner on the way home, and she happily replied yes. Something looked wrong about Thomas but she couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. Sarah walked with him to his apartment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna a drink before you go deal with the kids?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah smiled and stepped into his house. Thomas waked over to the bar and made a couple of drinks. Sarah sat down on the leather couch, she glance over at Thomas and noticed that his hair seemed a lot fuller, the bald spot was gone. His body was thinner and his clothes looked a lot better than they did earlier. In fact he looked a lot younger. Thomas handed her a glass of red wine as he sat down next to her. They spent a hour talking and drinking, Thomas made a small joke and Sarah laughed so hard that she spilled wine all over Thomas&#39;s shirt. He quickly took it off and she noticed that the hair on his chest looked like it was darkening and disappearing. Also his gut was shrinking and a nice six-pack was growing. She finally left after a passionate kiss and went home and made dinner for her kids. Afterwards she fell right to sleep and slept great just like the night before. <br />
<br />
The alarm went off and Sarah jumped out of bed. She felt alive with energy, she ran to the shower and spent even more time admiring her young body. Her breasts seemed to be tighter, higher up on her chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this is great&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked into the mirror and a very young 20 year old girl looked back. She picked out clothes even more daring than yesterday. She smiled into the mirror and a sudden realization came to her, what if she keeps getting younger? She picked up the phone and made a appointment to see a doctor at 11:30 in the morning for today. She headed down the hall into the kitchen and began to work on making breakfast for the kids. <br />
<br />
&quot;MOM, what is happening to you. You look like maybe a college student at best.&quot; Missy exclaims as she walks in the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Its kind of scary, but it feels natural and I like the way people treat me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But you might keep going and I might have to change your diapers tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it, I am going to the doctor today at 11:30.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly her body shrinks a little and her robe starts to get bigger. She turns and looks in the mirror. Instead of a 20 year-old she sees a 17 year-old girl. She opens her robe and notices her boobs are firmer and a little smaller. No more d cup for her. Her face seems more childish, she giggles. She feels funny and her thinking is clouded as she stands before her teenage reflection. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this!&quot; she says. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me, we&#39;ll get you dressed and then take you to the doctor.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what about school?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom you changed into a teenager and you care about school!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; <br />
<br />
They walk into Missy&#39;s room. Missy opens her underwear drawer and hands her mother a pair of panties and a pair of shorts. Then Missy goes to the closet and gets her a shirt and the bra Sarah had mistakenly bought a cup size too big. Missy wasn&#39;t ready for an F cup bra yet but this one should fit her mom now. In the meantime she went to go tell bobby what was going on. <br />
<br />
Sarah stands in front of the mirror giggling. I feel like a teenager, this is soo cool. She opens a piece of gum and tosses it in her mouth. She puts on some make-up, not too much. She smiles and pops a bubble. Man, guys will want me so bad. She pushes her breasts up, her small nipple peaking thru the fabric of the shirt. I hope I get a few dates at school... wait I don&#39;t go to school... do I? Her mind seems to wander from teenager to her older self - a battle seems to be raging in her mind.</p>
