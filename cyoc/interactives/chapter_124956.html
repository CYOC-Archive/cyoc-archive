<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following morning you wake up and stretch, it was the day of the hypnosis with Trevor between mum and Zoe, the sun was up and shining bright as you shuffle downstairs you decide to sort things out as early as possible, so you grab some breakfast and eat it before you pass the door and notice a slip of paper hanging from the door so you pick it up and glance over it.<br />
<br />
“Hey sorry to bail on the hypnosis but something important came up so I’ll be gone all day, I’ll be happy to reschedule for another day just swing by to discuss tomorrow, Trevor” you set the paper down on the small table by the door and head upstairs to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Once you got ready you head off to get an early start you had made some plans for a study group with a few classmates, you arrive at the store to grab supplies and begin to look around, you grab various bags of chips and chocolate bars, cans of soda and bottles of water before you take it to the register to pay for them.<br />
<br />
“Got a party planned for tonight?” the store owner says as she rings up the items.<br />
<br />
“More like a study group, some of us have decided to study for a test, not a huge test but a test is a test after all” you say as you place the items into a bag.<br />
<br />
“Yeah it’s best to be on top of all that” she says.<br />
<br />
You finish bagging your items and pay for them, you say your goodbyes and leave, as you walk home you ponder on how many are truly going to show up, you feel a little thankful that Trevor is absent for the day as it will avoid all the awkwardness if he made himself present during study group.<br />
<br />
You arrive home and stash the goods in a hiding spot, you knew Zoe would take from it if she found it like she always does, once hidden you head up to your room and begin to use your computer, you now had time to kill before the others would show up.<br />
<br />
A few hours later you start to hear everyone moving about, mum soon calls you down for breakfast, despite having eaten already you didn’t want to be rude so you head down to eat again, you take a seat in the dining room and begin to listen to the conversations going around.<br />
<br />
“So Tanya is going out to the lake today, me and Lucy have both been invited, we’ll be there till six at the latest, Tanya said that when the sun goes down all the sex maniacs and full blown drunkards show up” Grace says.<br />
<br />
“Well how many of you are going?” Whitney asks.<br />
<br />
“Aside from me, Lucy and Tanya it’ll be roughly ten of us total” Grace says.<br />
<br />
“You see one of our classmates is moving away next week so this is sort of a leaving party if you will” Lucy says.<br />
<br />
Whitney nods as Zoe begins to speak up.<br />
<br />
“I’m aware I’m not exactly in mums good books but Vikki has gotten me a job it’s a waitressing gig down at Chuck’s Eatery, I’ll be starting tomorrow” Zoe says.<br />
<br />
Whitney doesn’t say anything at first but then speaks up “it’s a start but Vikki is a bad influence, I mean she fronts her own gang of punks at least that is what Linda said to me last month” she says.<br />
<br />
“Vikki isn’t trouble, the reason she stopped me from going to college is because we’re alike she didn’t want me going through hell at college, if she was such a bad person why did she go out of her way to get me a job?” Zoe says trying to remain calm.<br />
<br />
“Actually I’m inclined to agree with Zoe about Vikki, there is a guy at college who is a sort of social outcast, a lot of people bully him on this, Zoe would have fallen into the same circle, the fact she can’t keep her emotions in check is reason enough to not like her” you speak up.<br />
<br />
Zoe cuts you a glare for a moment when your mum speaks up.<br />
<br />
“OK, OK maybe Linda was wrong, but I’m still not a hundred percent ready to accept Vikki as she is, once she proves she is good hearted I’ll change my stance on her” she says.<br />
<br />
With that she stands up and departs the kitchen, soon Grace and Lucy follow to get changed for their trip leaving you with Zoe in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“What was with all the social outcast bullshit?” Zoe asks her voice quieter than before.<br />
<br />
“Sorry but I’ve met Vikki, hell I dated Vikki briefly a few years back, she can be troublesome at times, I just tried to stop all the pointless arguing between you and mum every day” you say.<br />
<br />
“Vikki is just misunderstood, you’d have known that had you continued to date her instead of dumping her for that bitch Kate” Zoe says.<br />
<br />
You just shake your head and get up you begin to walk past her to the door but stop for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Zoe listen, Vikki may mean well now but just try to be careful around her, she likes you so try not to piss her off, misunderstood or not she almost got me arrested on our second date” you say before you leave the dining area.<br />
<br />
You return to your room and hear both Grace and Lucy leave, then a few hours later you hear your mum leave heading off on a run, you check the time and see it being close to the end of lunch so you start making preparations, you head down into the garden and set up the table and chairs with an umbrella for shade, you didn’t want to waste the sunny day stuck inside.<br />
<br />
Not long after setting up the study area you hear the doorbell, so you hurry to the door and greet your classmates, as you open the door you find only two standing there, Virginia von White and her sister Mercedes.<br />
<br />
You knew that Virginia and Mercedes were from a rich family that lived in another town, they hated being rich as it lumped them into the snobby crowd, this was something you liked about them after they told you during an introduction at the start of college.<br />
<br />
“Just you two?” you ask them.<br />
<br />
“Well one or two others are running a little late, did they text you about that?” Virginia asked.<br />
<br />
“I haven’t checked my phone so I don’t know but please do come in, it’s just me and Zoe at the moment, mum is on a jog and Grace and Lucy are away till tonight” you say.<br />
<br />
Virginia and Mercedes head to the back garden as you pointed it out to them before you can go to grab the food and drinks from your hiding spot the doorbell rings again, you open the door and see Viola with two others Kurt and Phoebe.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jay, it’s just us three, I guess nobody else wanted to jump in on this” Viola says you hear the slight Swedish accent still in her voice.<br />
<br />
“Well there is actually six of us Virginia and Mercedes are here too, so let’s get our study on” you say showing the three new faces to the garden, as they head out you quickly go and grab the snacks before heading out to the garden yourself and settling down.<br />
<br />
The afternoon goes smoothly as you all joke and laugh while working, you take a few snack breaks and relax a little, your mum returns home from her jog and says her greetings to your classmates and soon it is five in the evening, you all agree to finish at six as you feel you have made some progress.<br />
<br />
As you do you begin to smell something wafting from Trevor and Butches garden, it smelled earthy but also sweaty, you shiver at the smell as you fall on the floor, the others around you doing the same, all six of you grunting and snorting, your noses all pushing up into partial snouts.<br />
<br />
You can hear your other neighbours squealing much like you and your classmates, your pants rip as a curly tail grows above your slightly fatter asses, your ears point and grow, everything continues for hours as you simply zone out everyone in the garden now mindlessly oinking and eating the food which had been knocked on the floor.<br />
<br />
Around eleven everyone starts to fall asleep in the garden the smell having gone long ago, and you wake up the next morning with everyone back to normal no signs of the pig features the only tell-tale sign anything happened was the holes in your pants, you and the others part ways so they can get ready for college while you decide on what to do before college.</p>
