<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Realistically, Ronnie could&#39;ve had her choice of any woman in this bar. The body Cynthia had given her would&#39;ve been enough to pique the interest of even the pickiest lady around. Yet among a sea of beautiful faces, lucious curves and lustful glares, her eyes ended up settling on someone who seemed like they were trying to avoid attention. Nestled into a booth and nursing her drink, the woman&#39;s side was the only visible part of her, the face covered by by careful arrangement of her jet-black hair. She seemed to be of an unremarkable build, and the clearly budget-bin dress didn&#39;t flatter her the way some of the other women were flattered by their designer clothes.<br />
<br />
All in all, someone who kind of blended into the background, perhaps by design - and it was that possibility that intrigued Ronnie. She had a hankering to understand why someone would come to a place like this and simply hide themselves away. More importantly, she was one of the only women who hadn&#39;t been oogling Ronnie yet, and that was enough to justify wandering over to greet her. <br />
<br />
The woman seemed to hear Ronnie&#39;s heels clacking against the floor as she approached, turning her head slightly to look up. From this angle, the slime-toting bombshell could make out only a single green eye, one that seemed to be full of anxiety - only more so when it took in the full sight of her impressive curves and form-hugging dress. Her hand trembled slightly as it lifted the drink to her lips, taking back a full swig.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just ripping through that stuff, huh?&quot; Ronnie asked with a smile as she finally stopped next to the table. The woman set her drink back down and nodded slightly, finally turning her face fully towards Ronnie - and it was then that she could start to imagine why this woman seemed so keen on not gaining any attention. One entire side of her face appeared to have practically been melted, the skin dragged, that side of her mouth left perpetually open. The corresponding eye was gone, covered by what appeared to be flesh that had melt down to seal over the socket. The damage wasn&#39;t contained there, either, as her ear appeared to be gone, along with a section of hair along the side of her head. Scarring on her exposed shoulder and upper arm seemed to confirm that whatever had caused these injuries had inflicted some effect farther down her body.<br />
<br />
Ronnie&#39;s eyes lingered on all of these scars for a grand total of one second, before she was back to staring into the woman&#39;s one remaining eye. The smile grew a bit wider as she sat down, arms folded on the table&#39;s surface. &quot;I&#39;m Ronnie. Don&#39;t suppose I could ask for your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
She blinked rapidly, taking a moment to respond. &quot;Uh... V-victoria. I&#39;m Victoria.&quot; There was a bit of an odd sort of slurring to her voice, subtle but present - likely a result of whatever had left one side of her body in that melted-looking state. &quot;C-can... uh... can I help you with something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, just wanted to come over and say hi.&quot; She shruggled slightly. &quot;You looked a bit lonely, over here all by yourself... I know the feeling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks, but... I don&#39;t think you... you really know it all that well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ronnie&#39;s hand moved forward slightly. &quot;Oh no, I get it. I really do. Women like us, see - we&#39;re both just so gorgeous, nobody c-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t do that,&quot; she curtly cut Ronnie off, looking down at the table. &quot;Look... i-if this is some stupid joke or dare or something, or you&#39;re just... trying to pity me... don&#39;t. Please just don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Victoria&#39;s reaction had caught her off guard, and she needed a minute to compose herself - would&#39;ve been longer, if Cynthia wasn&#39;t there to tug her back together. &quot;Okay... I&#39;m sorry. Didn&#39;t mean to make you think I was doing anything like that - because I swear I wasn&#39;t.&quot; She held up her hands. &quot;Honest to god - you&#39;re one of the only one women in this bar who hasn&#39;t been staring at me like the juciest hunk of meat they&#39;ve ever seen, and that got my interest. That&#39;s it, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
She finally looked back up into Ronnie&#39;s swirling blue eyes, staring into them through the course of a long, awkward pause. The silence finally broke with what seemed to be Victoria letting out a held breath and swallowing audibly. &quot;...sorry. Just... paranoid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, it&#39;s fine, no need to apologize.&quot; She reached up to rub the back of her neck. &quot;Let me guess... bad experience with weird scar fetishists.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brunette took another sip of her drink, then nodded. &quot;Yeah. Something like that.&quot; She shifted around a bit more, and her full arm on the right side briefly became visible. It looked to be locked in place, and covered in the same sort of melting-scars as her face, not to mention quite a bit shriveled up compared to her good arm. &quot;Guess you could say... I got burned.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both had a little giggle at the joke, punny though it was, and Ronnie couldn&#39;t help but fire back with her own little wordplay. &quot;I bet they all talk about how they want to <i>melt</i> into your arms.<br />
<br />
Victoria whistled. &quot;Ohhhhh, that was <i>bad</i>. That was shit I&#39;d hear playing Halo bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, what do you think I was doing before I came here, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Murdering someone with terrible puns, probably.&quot;<br />
<br />
The back and forth jabs continued for a little while after, both women constantly seeking to one up each-other&#39;s puns. Increasingly they were left giggling at the stupidity of it, their state only furthered by the ordering of several more drinks. When they finally seemed to run out of wordplay, at least for the moment, they were able to get into slightly more personal conversations, albeit still loaded to the brim with plenty of bad jokes alike.<br />
<br />
Victoria, as Ronnie soon learned, had arrived in town a few months ago, moving out here from the West Coast to advance her engineering career. The same career, as it turned out, that had left half her body in this state - an industrial accident several years back had burned her severely, nearly to the point of ending her life. Through sheer grit and spite, though, she had hung on, refusing to let her disfigurement and the subsequent loss of use in one arm stop her.<br />
<br />
The more she spoke about her past, and what had led her into being at this bar tonight, the more Ronnie and Cynthia both found themselves entranced. Truth be told, if she&#39;d approached a woman like this before tonight, Ronnie would&#39;ve doubtlessly fumbled up, gotten anxious, and said something incredibly stupid. Instead, she was casually trading increasingly flirtatious barbs, and even managing to ascibe some sense of excitement to her rather boring life of trudging through college and spending too much time playing video games.<br />
<br />
They ended up so lost in conversation that they didn&#39;t notice the bar was closing until the barkeep shooshed them out. Even as they hurried out the door, though, they were still laughing, leaning on each other for support in a mutual state of slight inebrination. She didn&#39;t feel a hint of shame or reluctance in pulling Victoria in tight, letting her chest rub against the other woman&#39;s good arm - and god knows the brunette didn&#39;t complain about having those giant mounds up against her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You! You, miss big boobies, are calling me a ride!&quot; Victoria insisted, poking her newfound acquaintance in the chest. &quot;I am not-&quot; She paused to hiccup. &quot;-I am not getting a drunk driving... thingy... because of you! If you hadn&#39;t&#39;a come around, and been so... so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn hot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn... fucking... hot... I would be at home, already drunk!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm... fine.... buuuuuut....&quot; She grinned and leaned in to whisper in Victoria&#39;s ear. &quot;Ifffff I order a ride... it&#39;s only going to one plaaaace...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmph!&quot; She rolled her eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you- <i>hic!</i> - are trying to... trying to get me into your apartment already... you big... sexy pervert!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t wanna-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say I didn&#39;t wanna, you bitsch!&quot; She giggled. &quot;Call&#39;a damn ride already!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a snort she nodded, reaching down into her phone and ordering a ride-share for the both of them, straight back to her apartment. It was a bit of an excercise in clumsiness, given her current state, but soon enough the ride was there, the driver trying his best not to give them odd looks as they kept up their stupid jokes and giggling all the way back. He almost seemed relieved to dump them off at their destination.<br />
<br />
There was more fumbling as Ronnie lead them to the elevator and inside her and Cynthia&#39;s apartment, still looking just how they&#39;d left it. It took her a solid thirty seconds to figure out locking the door - and as soon as she was done, Victoria was on her, dragging the curvy woman into a passionate kiss. They moaned as Ronnie started leading them back to her room, kicking off shoes along the way, and eventually flopping back onto the bed with Victoria still in her arms.<br />
<br />
As she worked to remove the other woman&#39;s dress, she could feel something shifting within her own body. Cynthia&#39;s slimy form was heating up - and it seemed like she had some ideas for how to enhance this encounter. It only made Ronnie even more excited, as her mind raced with all the possibilities that lay before her. The woman currently assaulting her jawline with kisses had no idea what she was in store for - but somehow, Ronnie was sure that she would love it all the same.</p>
