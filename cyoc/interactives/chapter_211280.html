<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg felt awkward going out of town again. Suddenly, the outside of the small bar felt so much larger. Even if it&#39;d been a very short time where he was looking down on everyone, now he was right back to looking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Charlie pet his head gently as they found new clothes for the catboy to wear. They found a shirt forest green shirt and some baggy brown pants. Not much in terms of defense, but better than wearing nothing at all. His small form didn&#39;t feel nearly as comfortable in the nude as his lion one. &quot;You&#39;ll be alright. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re all better.&quot; The petting continued but he made a weird face all of a sudden when they were alone in the changing room. Then quickly exited, tail tucked between his legs.<br />
<br />
Greg didn&#39;t understand but tried not to read too much into it. This was different for both of them so maybe there was something else going on that was making him upset. Otherwise, right now they needed to earn back some of that silver that they used to purchase him the new clothes along with a few smaller daggers. He didn&#39;t dare sell his great axes, but in the state he was in now, he could barely even hold one let alone actually use it.<br />
<br />
The farm was in sight. Neither him nor Charlie knew if it was weird that there were real bulls and cows mixed in with a few Anthroform ones. But it looked more like the Anthroforms were just tending to the field and making sure they didn&#39;t wander too far off the ranch. A large burly horse person came out to greet them. &quot;Why hello there!&quot; he called out from his barn. &quot;What might I be doing ta accept the presence of a few city boys as yourselves? Eh?&quot; A long piece of hay stuck out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;We saw that you needed some help on the farm,&quot; Charlie said, sticking out his hand to shake. <br />
<br />
The horse rancher did the same, but the size difference was unbelievable as his hoofed hand nearly encompassed Charlie&#39;s. &quot;That I do,&quot; he whinnied. &quot;Course I need all the help I can get.&quot; His eyes quickly turned to Greg. &quot;Though I don&#39;t think this one will be much help on the actual farm part. How bout you boys go an&#39; get started in the barn then I&#39;ll take this little one to the house ta do sum of the chores. I&#39;ll meet you in...&quot; he zoned off for a second as his tail whipped around. &quot;Let&#39;s just say a few.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie stepped in between. &quot;I don&#39;t know about that. We just had some problems with us splitting up a bit ago. I don&#39;t know if...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Greg answered. Though he was even a bit surprised by it as well. He shook it off. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine. You&#39;ll be just a shout away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just a shout away last time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be like last time,&quot; Greg pet Charlie&#39;s arm. &quot;Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Charlie agreed and headed off to the barn with Jeff.<br />
<br />
The rancher reached his arm around Greg and lead him back to the wide ranch style house. He went in through the front door. But once it closed, Greg felt almost a shock run through all of his fur. &quot;Something wrong little man?&quot; the rancher asked. He placed his hand on top of his head. The sudden jump made it look like he felt the same. His head shook a few times before he was back to &#39;normal.&#39; He stood up straight and then almost looked at himself differently. &quot;You know, working on a farm is a lot of hard work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something about the air between them shifted. Greg felt himself nod. Somehow it felt more like a brag as he said it rather than a statement of fact. A bit of a haze came over Greg as he stared at the large horse person. His broad shoulders and thick burly torso seemed so much more interesting all of a sudden. He wasn&#39;t paying attention to the words, rather the large man&#39;s actions. Everywhere the rancher&#39;s body moved, his eyes followed. He pulled at his shirt, revealing more of his chestnut fur along his chest. &quot;Is it getting hot in here?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Greg felt his shoulders shrug. It was impossible for him to pay attention to anything other than the horse. But even stranger, each time he looked at a body part, it seemed to be different the next time he looked. Like the sleeves of the rancher&#39;s shirt were looking more constrictive or the buttons holding his flannel shirt together were more strained.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right,&quot; the rancher stammered. One of his ears twitched as he smiled down at Greg. When they turned down the hall, he scratched his crotch, not expecting Greg to see. Not that Greg cared all that much. He couldn&#39;t take his eyes off the perfectly sculpted ass in front of him. It was nearly eyeline to him and each time that tail swished back and forth, he felt like it was showing it off. The jeans seemed to only constrict against it more, showing off the definition of his body all the better. His walk turned a bit more into a waddle as his thick quads brushed up against each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in here... And in here...&quot; his breathing grew a bit haggard as he looked around the bedroom. Confusion took over his face as he tried to think of anything other than the massive bulge between his legs. His pants were having the hardest time keeping it down. But it didn&#39;t help that his legs filled each pant leg completely. The rancher scratched at his crotch absentmindedly again trying to figure out what to say.<br />
<br />
Greg felt something strange inside his head ting. A soft bell rang in his ears and a compulsion took him over. &quot;I think I know what you want,&quot; he smiled coolly as be broke the distance between him and the horse. Then climbed the other man like a tree. With his massive frame it was very easy for Greg to do. He stopped when they were face to face and licked the horses nose. The rancher smiled awkwardly as he went in for a kiss. <br />
<br />
Their lips locked. The rancher never felt this before. He was so turned on that he couldn&#39;t help himself. His body craved the feeling of this small cat touching him. Before he knew it, the rancher was on his back on his bed as the cat continued to kiss him. His big hands undid his zipper allowing his aching cock free. The massive pole pointed to the ceiling as it rose out of its confines. He couldn&#39;t help it as it swung around.<br />
<br />
Greg broke the kiss even as the rancher leaned in for more. &quot;I know what you really want,&quot; he smiled deviously. Without skipping a beat he started stripping, showing off his slender body. There wasn&#39;t an ounce of muscle to be seen and he looked absolutely perfect. The way his lean body shimmied as he took off his pants made the rancher&#39;s cock throb with excitement. Pre started dripping out of the tip. &quot;Someone&#39;s excited,&quot; Greg said. He spun around from the big meaty cock, looking over his shoulder seductively as his tail meticulously whipped back and forth. <br />
<br />
The rancher stared blindly. His only thoughts were on that tight little asshole as Greg played with his cock. He leaned up ever so slightly to give the sensitive pucker a lick. Greg let out a giggle. &quot;Oh... Naughty boy,&quot; Greg taunted. &quot;Granny&#39;s kitties require payment if you want to be pleased...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Huh?&quot; the rancher looked confused and conflicted. his mind wasn&#39;t working right as he felt all his brain power resting in his cock. Just feeling those soft little paws was making it impossible to think about anything other than sex. He had to finish. He had to release. &quot;Fu-uck...&quot; he moaned. His back arched and hands grabbed onto the sheets with all their might. &quot;2 extra gold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Greg&#39;s tail continued to swish back and forth. &quot;10 gold.&quot; His finger gently rounded the tip of the rancher&#39;s cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gods!&quot; he cried out as he felt his balls try to release. &quot;10 gold! I&#39;ll pay ya 10 gold!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a mighty fine horsey,&quot; Greg smiled as he placed his ass on top of the massive cock and slid down on it like his hole was a bag of holding. He let out several happy yips as more and more of the massive cock slid inside of him. It had to be nearly a foot long and thick as a wine bottle. Even for a horse he was still pretty big.<br />
<br />
The rancher started panting harder. Any thoughts that he could have had were gone in complete bliss. His cock had never felt this sensitive nor had he ever had something touch it like this. This magic asshole was definitely worth at least 10 gold coins if not more. His mind split on the edge of pleasure and satisfaction. He felt his hips bounce on the bed as his mind rolled over into the feeling of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good horsey,&quot; Greg said as he lifted himself off the cock. He saw it deflate into something more manageable and leaned in to rancher&#39;s body. The bulky muscles turned into something far more sexy. His large belly leaned out and almost into abs. Greg gently traced the new lines on his body as the rancher slowly came down from the highest high he&#39;d ever been on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!&quot; he neighed. The buzz lingered as he came to. He looked to see Greg holding out his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;10 gold please.&quot;</p>
