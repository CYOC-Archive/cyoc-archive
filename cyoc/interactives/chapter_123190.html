<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather was absolutely furious as she ran away from Lyre High School. She should have been able to deal with Sophie easily. She was only a human kid while Heather was the ultimate carnivore. If she spent less time playing with her food, she&#39;d have ripped her and her boyfriend apart before those other kids could see her. Well, she won&#39;t be toying when she got the rest. The horses would be tough, but they were still prey animals. The huskies may be carnivores, but they were nothing compared to Heather. And the rabbits would be easy and delicious prey.<br />
<br />
Were she not in a haze of rage, Heather might be disturbed of how easily she thought of others as prey. Perhaps the saurian instincts were a lot stronger than she had reckoned. But then, she was already mentally unstable before she injected herself with her fossil cocktail. Her imbalanced mind probably gave her predatory instincts a lot more free rein.<br />
<br />
Her theropod legs propelled her the distance between Lyre High and WSA. Heather paid no minds to the birds flying overhead, not realizing they were Skye-Eye units keeping tabs on her location. As soon as Heather saw the Animalian school, she charged towards the front doors. Nothing was going to stand in her way this time. She&#39;ll gut every freak between her and her quarry if she had to.<br />
<br />
But before she could reach the doors, several police cars came racing into the parking lot, sirens wailing. A SWAT van was following behind them. The police parked in front of the school and several wolves and canines in uniform climbed out before aiming their guns at Heather. Captain Shelly spoke through a bullhorn, &quot;Heather Wilcox, you are under arrest for assault and attempted murder. Surrender or we will use force.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather laughed and said, &quot;So you really do have an animal police. You mutts really think you can stop a tyrannosaurus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not us, but they can,&quot; said Shelly, pointing back at the SWAT van. The doors opened and two large figures emerged. Heather&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. They were rhinos! Big, hulking rhinoceroses! Since when did rhinos work for the police? The SWAT armor they wore made them look intimidating enough, but it was clear they were very muscular underneath and their horns looked very sharp.<br />
<br />
But Heather was not about to be deterred. She had come too far, sacrificed her humanity, had to stowaway in ships, trek miles across countries until she got here. She was not going to lose her revenge now. Besides, tyrannosauruses could be triceratops in battle and those two rhinos weren&#39;t more than that. Heck, they only had one horn instead of three. Rage pushed Heather past any reluctance to hold back. Letting out an awesome roar, she charged forward.<br />
<br />
The rhinos lowered their heads and charged forward too. Heather was wary about the fast-approaching horns, but she was already formulating a strategy. She&#39;ll knock them aside, jump over the dogs, then head into the school. After that, it&#39;ll be a feeding frenzy for her. But the rhinos were not intending to gore her. They moved slightly apart as they ran, aiming for either side of Heather. They hit Heather with a double shoulder-check. Heather may be a lot larger as a dinosaur, but she wasn&#39;t immovable. She was knocked backwards and sent tumbling by the impact.<br />
<br />
Before she could get up, the rhinos were on her. They started tying her arms and legs together with rope. &quot;You have the right to remain silent,&quot; said one rhino, &quot;Anything you say or do can and will-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get off of me, you freaks!&quot; roared Heather, &quot;I came too far to get those brats! I&#39;m not stopping until-&quot;<br />
<br />
But then the other rhino looped some rope around her muzzle and pulled it tight. He tied her muzzle shut before saying, &quot;If you will not invoke your right of silence, we will enforce it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other rhino grinned and said, &quot;That&#39;s not proper police code, Sudan.<br />
<br />
Sudan shrugged and said, &quot;Those fangs are dangerous, John. She&#39;d take a bite out of anyone who got near her. Besides, from what I hear, she&#39;s insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not our place to place judgement on criminals,&quot; said Shelly as she walked over to them, &quot;That&#39;s for the courts to decide.&quot; She gave a distasteful glare at Heather and said, &quot;But, personally, I think anyone who would try to kill children in cold blood has to be insane. Take her away, boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a limited amount of thrashing that Heather could do with her limbs and mouth bound. Her tail had more freedom, but it was held very securely as the rhinos carried her over to the SWAT van and tossed her in the back. Heather let out a muffled roar of frustration and denial as the doors were slammed shut.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The aftermath of the &#39;Wilcox Assault&#39; had the nation buzzing for quite a while. This incident revealed a lot of things about Animalia. For starters, it showed just how dangerous the Animalian Virus could be if it got into the hands of the criminally insane. But it did show effective the Animalian police force was, especially the Rhino Guard. While Heather&#39;s rampage will definitely taint some people&#39;s view of Animalia, the Rhino Guard&#39;s actions will at least offset it and keep it from becoming a total fiasco.<br />
<br />
Of greater fortune was that medical response was very swift in tending for Roland. It seemed a little close at first, but it turned out that Heather had not secreted enough saliva for her bite wound to have permanently infect Roland. An application of the vaccine kept him from transforming, though his wounds still needed cleaning to prevent other kinds of infection. But sides from needing a small blood transfusion and several stitches, Roland was going to be fine. He might have a few scars, but Horizon Labs promised that if Roland wanted to convert for removing the scars or any other reason, it would be provided for free.<br />
<br />
But asides from all the near-horror, one aspect certainly did not go unnoticed. Heather being able to turn herself into a dinosaur was astounding to everywhere. More than that, Heather was not, as some people might believe at first glance, a tyrannosaurus. She had gotten her saurian DNA from samples of the bones used to construct the &#39;Spiny Tyrannosaur&#39;. The name itself was a misnomer not just because of how the bones belonged to different species, but several of them were allosaurs, which gave Heather her spines and horns.<br />
<br />
But there was also the concern of how Heather was able to get her hands on the Animalian Virus in the first place. Apparently, not everyone at Horizon Labs was clean and a proper investigation into the employees will need to be conducted.</p>
