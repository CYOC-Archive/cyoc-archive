<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now, it you please Jess, ...click!&quot; <br />
<br />
A stinging sensation reached her nerves and brain cells, spreading all over, almost burning her vocal chords. This lasted around half a minute, yet to Jess, it felt like an eternity. The pain slowly faded. Jess noticed nothing had changed. She still had all her fingers and toes, she remained normal on the outside, and she still had her thoughts, even though they were a bit shocked. This was it, Jess had to unleash hell upon James, verbally and loud. Jess spoke...<br />
<br />
...but not in the way she wanted.<br />
<br />
All that came out of her mouth was various clicks. Clicks and squeaks. Jess realised that something had changed. She starts to panic, as James continues to smile away, knowing exactly what&#39;s happening. Jess tries to talk again, more squeaks and clicks come out of her mouth. James starts to chuckle. Jess hears him chuckle under his breath, and starts to stomp her way towards him. &quot;Oh, no, no, no, you can&#39;t do that&quot; he replies, as he lifted up the control box &quot;Stop&quot;. Jess froze, leaving her in a stand up, stationary position. She couldn&#39;t do anything from the neck down, not able to lift up a finger to stop him coming closer towards her. &quot;I&#39;m glad they&#39;re working, sometimes experiments like this don&#39;t work at all. You know what modern technology is like, always breaking down at some point, always having to re-boot it&quot; James smugly said. Jess couldn&#39;t hear anything apart from the angry growls that her coming out of her mouth. &quot;Well, considering that the nanobots worked perfectly with your vocal chords, let&#39;s give them a test, shall we?&quot; James asked the fuming Jess &quot;How &#39;bout why start with... the whole body. Everything inside and out. Won&#39;t that be fun?&quot;. James started to turn away, but thought it would be better if he watched the change the whole way through. Jess started to click in panic, trying her hardest to prevent him from doing any more damage to herself. James started to lift up the control box, his mouth was a small distance away from the microphone, but still could be heard. &quot;Begin&quot;.<br />
<br />
The stinging pain returned, spreading around her body like jolts of electricity. Her hands felt like they were cramping up, and her feet felt like they were in sort of medieval torture device, feeling like they were being pulled apart. Her whole body began to squirm and twist, as her mind was being shocked by nanobots, striking every nerve they can enter. Jess tried to open her eyes to see what James had done. As she opened her eyes, something already caught her attention, her shoulder looked hairy. Her eyes fully opened wide, as she saw the hairy continue to grow and slowly spread to the other shoulder. The hair on her shoulders were thin and had a orange tint to them. It continued to slowly spread downwards along her body. As her feet were still in raging pain, it felt she had more room for her toes, like some of her toes were missing. Her ears felt like they were being pulled by an angry toddler, they felt like they were stretching, as well as moving. James looked on, smiling, watching this girl&#39;s ears shaping themselves into triangular animal ears. Some of the hair was spreading towards her arms, as Jess saw her fingers begin to turn stub-like and her nails hardening, turning them into charcoal black claws. The muscles in her arms tensed up, reshaping themselves to fit the new body. Her nose starts to turn black, as the hair surrounds her face. Jess felt her feet pushing against her shoes, as her (now) three toenail-like claws start to rip through her sneakers. The pads on her hands start to swell and turn black. Jess felt something push out behind her, forcing itself against the fabric of her pants, as the hair started to thicken. Jess tried her hardest to fight it, but it was a losing battle and her mind was struggling to fight back as the nanobots continued to change her. Jess couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. She screamed in pain, while her feet burst out from her shoes showing her new longer feet and a new slowly developing tail cut straight through her pants, as the nanobots start taking over her mind. As the nanobots enter her brain, her whole body went limp. Her arms dropped from their position and went side to side. Her eyes were glazed, as the hair slowly thickened into orange fur. Her nose and jaw slowly pushed forward to form a small muzzle. A layer of skin on her stomach slowly turned itself into a pouch.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ve got to stop it&quot; Jess thought hard about every bit of her life to remain human &quot;Think about your human life, My mother was a sales accoun- acco- no, what was it again? My mother wa- She gathe- &quot; For Jess, trying to resist the changing thoughts was harder than she expected. &quot;M-My mother was a... My mother was... We always would travel together, yeah, that&#39;s it, She would always carry me in her pouch- Wait, no, that&#39;s not... Wait... No, I was wrong, that was right. She would carry me to school- School... School? Wha- I would always go outside and danc- da- h-Hop around. Yeah... that&#39;s right... hopping around outside... I love hopping around... I always hop around... Feeling the wind through my hair- ha- f-f-fur. Wind flowing through my fur... That&#39;s right... My orange fur...&quot;. The muzzle continued to lengthen, the tail continued to grow, and her feet continued to stretch, as she was slowly starting to lose who she was. &quot;I remember when my mother always called out to me... She always used to say... What did she say? Wait, what did she call me? I know it was my mother, why else would she have a tail? Wait, tail?... Did she... Yes, she always had that tail... What did she call me?...&quot;.<br />
<br />
James chuckled as he saw this woman slowly turn into a half kangaroo, half human creature. &quot;This is too fun, I wonder what would be more fun?&quot;</p>
