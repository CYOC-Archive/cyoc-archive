<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What is this?” Kat suddenly hefted up the iPad with her lips curling up with distaste and a slightly smug grin, all wrapped up into one. The screen was a partial blur of movement, but Dan from his lowered position could see at least the overall premise: an older, dominating gay man towering over some twink. “It’s all older men! Gay men! Treating little teenagers like their bitches!” <br />
<br />
“T-that man! That could be his father!” Their mother let out a little, breathy gasp as she wiggled a finger at the screen. Dan instantly felt a hot red flush speckle across his cheek as his bare, exposed cock quivered with a single jump at the idea. “No! It couldn’t! I-I didn’t even watch that!” He thought. Yet, he felt a gush of warmth spreading down his stomach and spreading through his groin. <br />
<br />
“Oh! Look! He likes that! He reacted!” Kat jammed her finger towards his cock, bringing even more attention to the naked length of his rod. His tip gave a tremor from her sudden attention, only worsening her reaction. “He wants to be a bitch!” <br />
<br />
“Hmm, how can we give Dan exactly what he fantasizes about then, hmm?” She turned to their mother, smirking. <br />
<br />
At first, Janice didn’t seem to follow, but then her eyes went wide! “Oh! Surely! Well, you know your father trains the dogs for the K9 program? I mean, if he wanted to be a bitch, that can... very literally be arranged.” <br />
<br />
“Oh...” A huge spread started to spread out over Kat’s face as she realized what Janice was suggesting. She clapped her hands softly together as she smirked down at Dan’s tied shape. “You know about that, right Dan? How dad trains the police dogs for the squad? He has to make sure they follow every little command... They have to come out truly submissive so they can be trusted!” <br />
<br />
Dan’s eyes had grown wide. A chill raced down the length of his spine at the mention of the K9 training program. His father was strict, the best trainer they had. He could have dogs trained well enough to clean off another dog’s dick after a piss, to ensure that he would respond to any command. “That... that would be terrible.” He felt a sudden heaviness in his gut. <br />
<br />
Janice was nodding, looking very solemn. “You know. I think this is perfect. If your brother wanted to be degraded in this way, then we’ll give him exactly what he wanted. He’ll get trained just like the little fag he is, until he’s even fit to be in the K9 program. Once he’s submissive to his father, he’ll learn to be submissive to every other dog at the kennels...” <br />
<br />
“Maybe Katie will even help!” Kat interjected, smirking. Dan’s mind flashed with the domineering ex-girlfriend of his who ended up working right alongside his dad. “She always was a bossy bitch-” Dan thought, scowling. “It makes sense she’d end up telling dogs what to do!” <br />
<br />
“Invite her to your birthday party then! See how Dan feels about seeing her again.” Janice suggested, smiling slightly in the cool calculated mother who’s figured out her plan for discipline. <br />
<br />
“I think though Dan should drive these changes, give himself a chance to prove himself differently, don’t you think? Maybe just use a veil over him for other to see until he started adjusting into the role. That way, we’ll know for sure if he finishes the changes by the end of the week, then he’s destined to be a German Shepherd, made for it!” <br />
<br />
“How do you like the sound of that, huh Dan?” <br />
<br />
He wanted to shake his head, to speak, but he knew it’d only make it worse. His pouting lips must have been enough though to make Kat laugh. “What? You don’t want to be daddy’s little bitch?” <br />
<br />
“No!” He blurted. “Of course I don’t.” <br />
<br />
“You don’t want to be forced to sit on command? To lay at dad’s feet while he works, ready if he needs anything? You don’t want to eat crunchy, dry kibble out of a bowl in the kitchen? Or do your business outside in the bushes?” <br />
<br />
Dan’s face was brightening, turning redder and redder. As she spoke, he couldn’t help but tremor down the length of his body, quivering his exposed dick. “What’s happening to me? I don’t want this!” He thought, but his body thought differently, much to Kat’s delight. <br />
<br />
“You do, huh! You want to go on long walkies, dragging forward on your knees, mimicking the little bitch you are. That’s what all these videos tell me, Dan! That you want to be given the most humiliating, degrading progression into your full change!” <br />
<br />
“Full change? Have you lost your mind?” Dan blurted back, overwhelmed with the speed of this encounter and his own loss of control over himself. <br />
<br />
“Hey!” Janice snapped, wagging a finger at him. “We didn’t tell you ‘speak!’” <br />
<br />
Dan’s face bloomed with new redness as his whole body flushed with pink now too. Then, he felt his tongue like a lump in his mouth, resisting making a sound. <br />
<br />
“It’s clear, Kat. He needs discipline. Whatever happens after, I think he needs this training first. He needs to follow commands, sleep in the kennel... I mean, he needs to be taken down a peg.” Janice was nodding, face serious. “I’ll talk to your father, make sure that he gets an intense training, the most humiliating, degrading thing he can do so that there’s no more of this resistance, this brattyness!” <br />
<br />
“W-what? Brattyness?” Dan thought, but he found his tongue wouldn’t move now. He couldn’t interject and interrupt them any longer. His mother, it seemed, with her command had frozen his tongue. <br />
<br />
“Who knows, maybe someday he’ll be a behaved, licensed K9 dog with some purpose to his life on dad’s leash!” Kat thought, smirking. “That way he’d really do something with his life!” <br />
<br />
“Maybe, but let’s not make our hopes too big. This might just have to be the first attempt at ironing your brother out.” <br />
<br />
“We’ll have to start with a visit to the vet, bring him into the program officially. He’ll need to be inspected and de-wormed right away-” Janice was talking now, working out a plan, but Dan’s head was flooded with sudden thoughts. <br />
<br />
“How did mom stop my voice? What’s happening here? Are they really going to change me into a dog? Wait? The vet? Some stranger touching me all over? Inspecting me?! Wait, what if she’s hot?” A sudden warmth started to spread through his gut, heating up around his groin as a little grin curled on his lips. <br />
<br />
“Ah! Look! He’s thinking about it! He’s excited!” Kat’s eyes went wide as she looked at her mother, “Let’s do it! It’s time!” Her hands started to move through the air while her focus grew intense and purposeful. She started to cast the magic over her brother, tied up on the chair, but at first nothing showed. Nothing changed visibly in front of them, not for the two witches, but to a bystander, as the magic started to spread over Dan and seep into his skin, he started to look less and less human. <br />
<br />
As the spell finished, Dan’s appearance to anyone else was that of a classic, tan and brown patterned German Shepherd who was impressively sitting up on a chair, at the moment, but as Dan day-dreamed to himself, growing excited with the idea of some hot, coat-bursting, well-bosomed vet inspecting him even his true form began to change. <br />
<br />
From the base of his spine, right at the hole in the back of the chair, he started to push out a growth as a tail unfurled out from above his ass. Fur sprouted from it rapidly as Dan felt a sudden, intense heat powering the magical change. <br />
<br />
“W-what’s happening to me!? What is this?!” He thought, shifting and thrashing to try and see as a tail grew out from the base of his spine, right in the lower dip of his back. <br />
<br />
“Ah! Look! He’s already triggered a change himself!” Kat waved her fingers, gleefully seeing her magic having worked. <br />
<br />
“Dan, already?” Janice shook her head, sighing deeply. “I thought you’d last an hour or so before... but I guess, you truly do want to be a little bitch-” <br />
<br />
Dan stared at her, eyes wide with confusion. <br />
<br />
“You see, Dan. The magic that’s been cast only changes how you look not how you are but it acts as a background spell and when you give into the behaviors of a dog, you’ll start to trigger the rest of the spell, changing more and more of you into a German Shepherd. If you change rapidly enough into a dog, the change is irreversible, but if you last a week without a full transformation, then the caster can undo it.” <br />
<br />
Kat jumped in place with a grin spreading over her lips. “That’s me! But Dan, you don’t stand a chance! You’re already becoming a dog!” <br />
<br />
<br />
Behind him, Dan could now feel the fluff and hairs of the tail that had grown out of him. It was swishing and swaying, involuntarily responding to their words. He felt every pass of it brushing against his neck ass where the base shifted from his spine. “I-I have a tail!?” Dan strained to see himself, flushing madly at the almost kinky appearance of his naked form with nothing but a tail. Without looking closely, it could have been a butt-plug accessory jutting from him. <br />
<br />
“But, don’t worry about being naked, everyone already sees you as a dog, and dogs are always naked-” Kat smirked, chuckling to herself. “But, the one problem is... doggies don’t sit up like that-” She waved her finger and Dan’s bonds fell away and he tipped forward. His hands flew up to stop the sudden fall and he dropped onto the ground of the shed on hands and knees. “Now that, that is better! That’s how a good, little bitch will walk!” <br />
<br />
“Let’s make sure that he listens to commands too, hmm?” Janice waved her hands, adding onto Kat’s spell as Dan’s hair started to part as ears sprouted out from his head. Floppy, velveteen ears pushed out atop his head, suddenly finishing his initial transformations in a sort of anthropomorphic play at being a dog. <br />
<br />
“Now you can’t disobey a command from either of us, but your father... we’ll let him break you the old-fashioned way.” <br />
<br />
Dan felt a sinking in his stomach at her words. From where he was, he could only see their feet, but he didn’t want to look up and see Kat’s sneering face over him. He could practically feel her amusement radiating off form her spot a few feet away. So instead he kept his gaze down, feeling more and more like he was settling right into this role they made him. “What’s going to happen now? I have to play doggy for a week and then I change back?” His tongue still didn’t move, wouldn’t shift to speak so instead his question just echoed back in his head with no response. <br />
<br />
“Oh Daddy will be so excited to have another dog to train!” <br />
<br />
“Shall we go introduce him then?” <br />
<br />
“No, no.. no!” Dan started to hear nothing but his own voice pleading no in his head. He didn’t want to go to the house! Have his father see his naked, crawling form on the ground! Or worse, see a dog in his place. They could be lying, tricking him somehow with this... greater spell<br />
<br />
“Let’s!” <br />
<br />
The girls headed towards the door of the shed, and with a slap of her knee, Kat called back: “Come, Danny!” and his legs, without a thought of his own, started shuffling forward with his bare knees sliding against the rough texture of the garage. “W-what’s happening? What? I-I’m like a big doll! I can’t do a thing!” Dan struggled against the magic, but his body wasn’t listening, as much as he didn’t want to he was moving rapidly towards being a well-trained, little bitch.</p>
