<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brick could sense a bit of nervousness as Jared entered the gym. It was foreign territory for the little nerd, and shivers of unease went through him. Good. The more off-balance Jared was, the more control Brick had. <br />
<br />
Yet Brick could feel Jared turning around, heading for the exit. No! He couldn&#39;t have the little geek wuss out now! Brick shouted from inside the pocket, trying to get Jared&#39;s attention. But Jared either didn&#39;t hear, or wasn&#39;t listening. Scowling, Brick reached for the nub of flesh jutting under the fabric of the pocket: Jared&#39;s nip. Brick squeezed and twisted it like a steering wheel. That got Jared&#39;s attention. He made a little squealing noise and ran to the locker room, fleeing into a stall. A moment later he roughly pulled Brick out of the pocket. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck was that for?&quot; Jared hissed, holding Brick up between a thumb and forefinger. <br />
&quot;You were heading in the wrong direction, dude,&quot; Brick calmly replied. He felt the grip on him tighten to match Jared&#39;s scowl, but Brick was a genie now, and his body was tough, despite its size. <br />
&quot;You don&#39;t tell me what to do!&quot; Jared growled, his brows knitting together in anger. <br />
&quot;You wished to be bigger and stronger, o Master,&quot; Brick smoothly shot back, his voice becoming formal and genie-like. &quot;I have improved your body&#39;s natural ability to build muscle and add height. But for your wish to come true, you must participate in the reshaping of your body. If you leave the gym now, the wish will not be fulfilled, o Master.&quot; <br />
Jared paused for a moment, staring at the little naked man between his fingers. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said at last, &quot;You might have a point. Just remember that I&#39;m a beginner.&quot; <br />
Brick wanted to laugh--&quot;beginner&quot; was the understatement of the year! But he simply smiled and nodded, as his voice slipped back to jockbro mode. &quot;I&#39;ll train ya, dude. No worries! I&#39;m a great coach. You&#39;ll be huge in no time!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jared nodded, and slipped Brick back into his pocket. He slowly walked out to the gym floor, still nervous, but more determined than before. He looked down in the pocket, and Brick looked back up at him. &quot;First, some warm ups. Go over by the mirrors, and I&#39;ll lead you through a few.&quot; <br />
Jared nodded once more, and walked toward the mirrors, seeing his skinny body in the reflection. &quot;Man, I wish I didn&#39;t have to keep looking in my pocket to hear you, genie,&quot; he muttered, mostly to himself. But Brick heard it, and a moment later the wish was granted. <br />
&quot;Your wish is my command, o Master,&quot; Jared heard. <br />
He looked down at his pocket. &quot;How did you learn to talk so loud?&quot; he asked. <br />
Brick looked up at him. &quot;You are only hearing me in your mind, o Master. It is what you wished for.&quot; <br />
Brick&#39;s lips didn&#39;t move when he spoke. Jared was poleaxed. He wasn&#39;t sure about having someone... something in his mind. As Brick led him through a series of warmup exercises, he realized it was quite convenient. When Brick ordered him out to the weights, Jared didn&#39;t question it at all. <br />
<br />
For the next two hours,  Brick led Jared through a brutal workout. Safely tucked away in the pocket, Brick had great fun ordering Jared around, pushing the boy to his limits, then past them. Jared complained bitterly at first, whining that he was getting tired, that his body was sore, even that he was sweating too much. Brick turned aside each complaint, reminding Jared of his wish, ordering him to do more and more reps as punishment for the complaining. By the second hour of the workout the whining had stopped, and all Brick heard from Jared was groaning during lifts, and heaving breathing between sets. He could feel the cloth around him getting damp as Jared&#39;s sweat soaked through it. <br />
<br />
After two hours, Brick told Jared to stop. &quot;No,&quot; the little nerd grunted back, his body still moving as he refused to stop lifting. <br />
&quot;I pushed you hard, but you&#39;ll really overtrain bad and fuck yourself up if you keep on going,&quot; Brick warned. It was partially true--with as hard as he&#39;d pushed Jared, he figured the little geek would be sore for a week as it was. <br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Jared shot back, his voice louder now. A few people around started looking at him, and he stalked away, heading for the locker room. Inside, he pulled Brick out of the sweaty pocket. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me!&quot; Jared told the genie, setting him down by the sink. Brick looked up at Jared, and was shocked by what he saw. The wimpy little geek was gone, replaced by a proper stud. Muscles rippled under Jared&#39;s skin, along with a network of veins that carried blood along his pumped body. He wasn&#39;t huge yet, but he looked like a jock now, covered in lean, defined muscle. For once, Brick was speechless. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m buff now, but I wanted to get huge, remember?&quot; Jared continued. He pulled up the hem of his damp shirt, revealing an enviable six-pack. &quot;You said it yourself: I need to put in the work to get really big. And I will!&quot; Jared grinned broadly, lifting his arms and flexing. Respectable biceps muscles rose at his command, fifteen-inches of lean, muscled arm. &quot;And remember what I said: I wished to be huge! Not just toned, not just buff, not just big... I wish to be HUGE!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your wish is my command, o Master,&quot; Brick replied, before even realizing that his lips had moved. Jared let out a low moan of pleasure, feeling a soothing warmth fill his muscles. His sweaty body trembled, then began to swell, the pumped muscles throbbing and growing, getting bigger and bigger with every deep breath he took. &quot;YES!&quot; Jared roared, his voice resonating as it grew deeper and more manly. His body expanded in every direction. He got taller, and his shoulders got broader, while his limbs lengthened and grew. Muscle raced to fill the space being created, swelling under his once-loose workout shorts and damp shirt. No longer baggy, it hugged his big lats and pecs as they swelled, and stretched across his huge back. He raised his arms again to flex, watching his arms go from nineteen inches to twenty, then to twenty-one. He brought his arms down and ripped off his damp shirt, tossing the wreckage to the floor, his jaw dropping at the sight of his own reflection. His body was positively beastly, his sweaty muscles huge and pumped from the insane workout he&#39;d just done. He turned, admiring his body from several angles, loving the sight of his huge new physique.<br />
<br />
Brick stood at attention, and spoke to Jared&#39;s mind. &quot;O Master, you are now six foot four, you weigh 325 pounds, and your upper arms are twenty-two inches around. You have a fifty-five inch chest, but only a thirty-four inch waist. Your thighs are twenty-eight inches around. Are you pleased with your wish?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jared looked down at Brick and smirked. &quot;This will do nicely. For now.&quot; He picked the small genie up. &quot;Since I don&#39;t have that stupid shirt any more, you&#39;ll have to ride somewhere else,&quot; he mused. He pulled the elastic of his sweat-soaked briefs and dropped Brick into the pouch area, next to his cock and balls. &quot;I want to be huge everywhere, Brick,&quot; Jared added, pointing to his ordinary dick. &quot;You should work on that while I jog back to my room.&quot;</p>
