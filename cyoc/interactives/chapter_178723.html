<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke kept looking for chances to mess with the bracelet through the day, but with his new position now pending he wasn&#39;t really able to get some free time. At least the weekend was coming up, two days to have to himself, other than the need to go buy a bunch of new underwear. What had he gotten himself into?<br />
<br />
By six, there were only two people left in the office, everyone else having fled for the evening. Dennis sat in another chair in Luke&#39;s cubicle as he went over his work, getting the other guy ready to take over for him. It was the first prolonged interaction he&#39;d had with Dennis since he had messed around with him and he was surprised how much the physical changes had changed his attitude. He though Dennis might end up being one of those short guys with shorter tempers, but he was actually pretty calm and almost submissive. &quot;So, I think that about covers it. I&#39;ll still be around for any questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
He also kept looking over at Luke, scooting closer at every chance he got, until finally Luke felt a hand on his thigh. &quot;Good, I think I&#39;ll need some help on the one project.&quot; He looked over at Dennis, who met his gaze, but seemed to take Luke&#39;s silence as permission and felt up the thigh until his hand rested on Luke&#39;s bulge, rubbing it through the thin fabric of his trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Luke said, trying to keep his tone as steady as possible. Dennis looked down, but nodded. &quot;Take off your shirt.&quot; He tried to use the same tone that Wilkins had spoken to him with earlier. Not so much a command but definitely a request he expected to be followed. As Dennis reached for his tie, Luke shook his head. &quot;Leave the tie on.&quot; Technically, his new promotion put him above Dennis, he wasn&#39;t Dennis&#39; boss but still a step above him in the office pecking order now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Dennis did as instructed, unbuttoning his shirt and sliding it down and off his shoulders and arms. Luke hadn&#39;t changed Dennis&#39; muscles in their previous encounters, just shaved off height, so Dennis still had a nice, athletic body, similarly proportioned to his old one, just shorter. He was still good looking, but it was somehow cuter than before. Luke grabbed Dennis&#39; tie and used it like a leash to pull him in close. So many months this guy had been an ass to him, and now was his chance to dominate him. It was like a drug thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Another tug brought Dennis in closer and their mouths met. The shorter man was eager, pressing into the kiss hungrily. Maybe he did have a crush on him like Valerie thought. One hand stayed on Dennis&#39; tie while he held him in place, the other explored his muscled torso. Luke could feel stubble under his fingers. Of course Dennis shaved. But he had the feeling he might be a bit on the hairier side if he grew it out. His pecs and a wide strip of his stomach was covered in short stubble. It was blond so it was hard to see, but Dennis must not have shaved down in a couple of days since he could feel it. It didn&#39;t seem right on a little twunk like Dennis was.<br />
<br />
Luke felt a hand on his cock. Dennis had opened the front of his trousers and fished out his monster which quickly grew to full size. &quot;Holy fuck, man, why aren&#39;t you doing porn?&quot; Dennis held the cock in his hand like a treasure. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I can..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked you, you nodded.&quot; Luke said, teasing, smiling. He grabbed one of Dennis nipples between his fingers. Just how hairy was the guy anyway. Would unshaving him even work? Luke wasn&#39;t shaved down, so he focused on transferring how trimmed his body hair was onto Dennis. It worked almost immediately. The stubble grew out like a time lapse video. Straight blond hair covered most of Dennis&#39; chest, a wide strip down his stomach to his waist band which now had a bit of a bush showing over the top. He has as hairy as Gio, not as bad as Wilkins though.<br />
<br />
Dennis of course noticed nothing, to him this is how he looked. He bit his lip as Luke played with his nipple though. With Luke&#39;s next thought the hair on Dennis&#39; chest began retreating. He did look better smooth. Luke couldn&#39;t completely help him out there, as changing himself to Italian this morning had given him a bit of hair, but it was significantly less than Dennis&#39; current pelt.<br />
<br />
As Dennis knelt between Luke&#39;s legs, opening his mouth to take as much of the cock as he could, Dennis&#39; chest hair retreated to just the lightest dusting in the middle of his chest, with a faint line up his stomach to his navel, its blond color making it look even lighter. Luke was wrong. Dennis looked better like this. Not completely smooth, but just enough to suggest some manliness.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the bush at the base of Luke&#39;s cock spread, growing wild and curly. Luke pulled up his shirt, feeling the curly black hairs growing in along his abs. He could feel the hair growing in under his shirt, feeling the way the fabric rubbed against the hairs growing in on his pecs, his own hand following to explore as he felt the moist warmth of Dennis&#39; mouth engulfing his cock. Just another aspect of Dennis&#39; manhood becoming Luke&#39;s. He had traded their body hair amounts, leaving the color and look of the hair alone.<br />
<br />
Dennis had fished out his own cock, and was pumping it with one hand as he worked on fitting as much of Luke&#39;s girth between his jaws as possible. Luke felt for him, having had to try with that girth this morning himself. He smiled down at his old cock which now rested between Dennis&#39; legs, looking better on the proportionally smaller body. He could feel Dennis&#39; tongue between the shaft of his cock and his foreskin, it made him shiver. He&#39;d have to remember that one for Wilkins.<br />
<br />
He felt himself getting close, and part of him still wanted to humiliate Dennis get back at him for being an asshole. So as he felt his cum building he pulled himself out of Dennis&#39; mouth, a few final pumps causing him to unload stream after stream of cum across Dennis&#39; face and chest. It was almost gratifying to see the Dennis seemed to enjoy being bathed in cum, enough that he emptied his own load onto the floor. Grabbing some tissues off his desk, Luke wiped off his cock before hiking up his pants. He gave Dennis&#39; a pat on the cheek careful not to get any of his cum on his hand. &quot;Might want to clean up. Janitorial will be here in a few.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke grabbed his backpack from under his desk and stood, leaving a sloppy Dennis where he knelt as he walked out. And it felt good.</p>
