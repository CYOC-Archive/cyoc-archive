<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You gather up the courage, Alexis is your name, about twenty-one, five six, and well, you don&#39;t like boasting but the sexiest girl in your highschool class. You stroll up to the castle, at the distance in the shadows it looked gothic but once you got close it now looked more like something out of the renaissance festival. But your eyes fall on the gargoyle statue, then it becomes creepy again. You stroll in and call out. &quot;H... Hello, anyone there?&quot; You look up out the high window and there&#39;s the gargoyle again. You could swear it&#39;s watching you. You shrug it off and find yourself in the dining hall. The interior decorator must&#39;ve been busy cause the inside was... well, stunning, and not in a bad way. You find yourself in a chair and it&#39;s quite cozy. You scan the room and there.... you swear by the door is.... it is. It&#39;s the gargoyle.... and it&#39;s moving.... you go to scream but he puts a finger to his mouth.<br />
&quot;Easy.&quot; He says with a Romanian accent. &quot;I&#39;m not here to hurt you. I am the castle&#39;s caretaker. You must be Alexander&#39;s granddaughter.&quot;<br />
&quot;Y... yes, but....&quot;<br />
&quot;All in due time. I&#39;m here to help you get aquainted with your new home. You see, child, I do hope your grandfather chose wisely, cause there are his distant cousin&#39;s he could&#39;ve given the place to but they would&#39;ve sold it.&quot; He looks at her and hands you a saucer with some tea.<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; You take and sips the tea. To your shock it&#39;s your favorite. An herbal tea too.&quot; You relax a bit and look at him. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; You ask.<br />
&quot;Name? Your grandfather just referred to me as his friend. He didn&#39;t need to give me a name.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. Well, I think you need a name. So how about.... Rocky?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you trying to make fun of me?&quot;<br />
&quot;No no.... I just think it fits you. Well I mean considering you&#39;re a gargoyle and....&quot;<br />
&quot;Gargoyles are rocklike?&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly. And well, I had a pet named Rocky, and well, we were friends. So... why not?&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually, Miss....&quot;<br />
&quot;Just Alexis works just fine. Though... you were creepy outside, and I....&quot; You look down. &quot;I&#39;m not too sure about the zoo thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Give it two weeks and you will see, and trust me, day two, you&#39;ll be so in love with the place....&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, the bright side is I have a castle. Don&#39;t everygirl dream of being a princess.&quot;<br />
&quot;I believe so.&quot;<br />
As you look Rocky over you distinguish that he is built as someone who worked out, six foot, and seems like he&#39;d work more than a caretaker, but as a body guard. After all, you bet his skin is as tough as stone. Eventually your eyes wonder down and your eyes fall right on his.... shorts? What the... you are taken aback by the shorts. He notices as he laughs. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He asks. &quot;Never seen a gargoyle in shorts?&quot;<br />
&quot;Only on tv, but never thought I&#39;d see one in shorts if I saw one, always thought....&quot;<br />
&quot;A loincloth? I get that a lot.&quot; He says.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s rather cute.&quot; You say with a giggle.<br />
&quot;Well... what else?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well if you were a human I&#39;d say damn hot.&quot;<br />
&quot;I do work out.&quot; He says with a smug expression.<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;ll get along just fine, Rocky.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I hope so, Alexis.&quot; He looks at her.<br />
As you two sit talking your eyes fall on his shorts again, your curiosity is about to get you into trouble. You go to look away but he stops you. &quot;I don&#39;t mind if you stare but...&quot; He shimmy&#39;s out of his shorts. &quot;Is that better?&quot;<br />
Your eyes land right on that cock of his. You then look at him. &quot;Uh.... yeah... and you&#39;re... big.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know, you can try it, but I warn you, if you proceed, you will change. No worries however, you will revert to yourself in the morning. It&#39;s the magic of the whole zoo. Tomorrow, once your things are here, I&#39;ll give you a tour.&quot; He says.<br />
You let out a sigh as you try to decide. Just then you shrug your shoulders and take his cock into your hands. You kneel down and begin licking at it, the length becomes rock hard. As you begin sucking he moves his tail and slides into your pants, <br />
[Note: From here the character will be in third person. First person was for the intro.]<br />
She looks up and stops sucking. &quot;Hold on.&quot; She removes her clothes, giving him a view of her body. Her breasts were a modest B cup. She began sucking again going to the base as he used his tail, her ears began to shift as her tail bone began growing. She moved up and began using her breasts on his cock as she licked one of his pecks. Soon she was on his lap as he helped her mount his cock. She slid down to the base and begin riding him. She felt so good, she didn&#39;t notice her wings growing in. He had taken her all the way to her womb as he leaned in and began kissing her. Their tongues began playing a game as he fucked her virgin pussy. She broke the kiss as she let out a moan. &quot;Now I know another reason to call you Rocky.&quot; She rides him harder and faster before he stands up and places her on the table taking her right there. He panted as he thrusted all in and soon the two came hard, he came enough filling up her womb to the brim and even then some. When he slid out her changes were complete. He smiled and helped her up, her breasts had gone from a B to a C cup. She looked herself over in the mirror, her skin looked red, but sparkled like rubies.<br />
&quot;Oh my, I think I like this.&quot; She says as Rocky&#39;s cum dripped down her leg. She walked with him as he gave her the tour of the castle and took her things to the master bed room. There he laid her to rest. She fell asleep and slept like she&#39;s not slept in years.<br />
<br />
In the morning she work up, her body was normal. Had the sex been a dream last night or is she going crazy. Anyway she decided to go for a stroll. Once her things were moved in and the movers gone, she looked at the gargoyle, he winked at her as she looked down. &quot;Okay so I am not dreaming.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not likely, he jumped down. Unless we&#39;re both going crazy.&quot;<br />
&quot;That wouldn&#39;t do anyone good, now would it, Rocky?&quot;<br />
He shook his head. &quot;Not really. Now you have two weeks to know the place and five to open to the public. I recommend hiring on your friends, but after you discover what you have, you can choose to either let them know or keep it all to yourself.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, so what kind of animals do I have?&quot;<br />
&quot;You have your typical farm animals, cows, sheep, horses, and all that. You have your domestic pets, cats, dogs, hampsters, you have your exotic cats, lions, tigers, all that, you have all sorts of common exotic animals. But the secret lies on the other side of the castle. You have your extinct animals, your mythical animals, and creatures of horror like myself.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a creature of horror. A creature that knows how to go with a lady is not a horrific creature.&quot;<br />
&quot;Suit yourself.&quot; He nudged her playfully. &quot;So what would you like to see to the care of first?&quot;</p>
