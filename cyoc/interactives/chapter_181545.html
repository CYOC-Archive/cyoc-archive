<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was silent in the lounge, Viki hadn&#39;t spoken a word since Lunas arrival, her eyes were red and puffy, she was just sat there staring blankly at the floor, lost in thought<br />
<br />
Lina wasn&#39;t any better her hands massaging the sides of her belly,<br />
&quot;Shees ok, right&quot; Asked Lina.<br />
<br />
The room was silent for a few moments, before Viki sadly said &quot; I hope so, iv known everyone in that sector for five years&quot; she sniffed &quot; and now Luna is the only one left, she&#39;s my only tie to them I have left&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lina didn&#39;t know what to say she had never known anyone go through something like this, she didn&#39;t know what to do or say, she wanted to help but she just didn&#39;t know how,<br />
<br />
Then the parts room door opened and Momo stepped out with a grim look, Viki struggled to get up as fast as she could, before Momo came over to stop her &quot;Sofia fixed what she could but she&#39;s not done yet, she&#39;s out of the woods for now but she needs rest&quot; she said resting her hand on her shoulder &quot;so, I can at least see her&quot; said  Viki, a hopeful look in her eyes &quot; Sofia said that we can see her one at a time, but in your case I think someone should go with you&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you go with me&quot; Viki said in a small voice &quot;of course I will&quot; Momo said, suddenly sounding tired, then Lina looked up at Momo and saw bags beginning to form under her eyes, the same could be said for Lucy as she was leaning on her elbows on the kitchen counter, her head drooping, her eyelids drooping, it was then Lina realised those two had been awake for twenty four hours straight, if not longer!.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you know, maby I could go with you&quot; suggested Lina, looking to Momo, who sent her a silent &quot;thank you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind&quot; said Viki &quot; thanks birdie&quot; she smiled, a small smile but Lina thought it was good enough regardless &quot;ok just, try not to freak out&quot; said Momo as Lina and Viki waddled over to the door, Viki tried to grasp the door handle but her hands shaking as they were she simply couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, iv got you&quot; said Lina as she opened the door and they stepped in.<br />
<br />
What greeted them was the assembly table had been fitted into a make shift surgery table, with a side table on the left with a tray, covered in blood and some small shining objects in it.<br />
Viki gulped and covered her mouth, tears once again threatening to overflow her eyes before saying<br />
&quot;Is that-&quot; &quot;shrapnel and bullet casings?&quot; Said Sofia grimly &quot;yes they are&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there attention was on the person on the table, a sheet covering up to their midsection, bandages covering almost every inch of her plastic body, her once empty midsection was once again whole, a different model than the others filling the gap, then they saw her face. Her hair had been tied back in a bun with a bandage covering her forehead and left eye, a patch covered the deep gash in her left cheek and an oxygen mask covered her mouth.<br />
<br />
But something about the shape of the sheet was off, Sofia noticed Viki eyeing the sheet and sighed &quot; I did the best I could, but some things were too badly damaged&quot; she said sadly &quot;pleas don&#39;t be mad&quot; she said as she too begin to cry.<br />
<br />
Viki pressed down where her Lunas left leg should be but her hand kept sinking until it hit the cool metal of the table, Lina knew she had figured out what Sofia meant by she couldn&#39;t fix everything, and she didn&#39;t need to lift the sheet to know that her friends leg wasn&#39;t there anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will she walk&quot; Viki spoke in a quiet voice, Sofia begin fumbling with her words &quot;well ummm, you see-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;TELL ME!&quot; Viki demanded slaming her hand on the table &quot;WILL SHE EVER WALK AGAIN!?&quot; all Sofia could do was look down  and she had her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey is that you vivi?&quot; Came a muffled voice &quot;I&#39;m here Luna&quot; Viki said as happily as she could &quot;where am I, and why is one side of the room dark?&quot; She asked as her eye opened&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sofia has the lights on this side off for you&quot; Viki said as she fought back tears<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ok, thank you Sofia&quot; Luna said sleepily with a half smile &quot;Sofia?&quot; Lina asked, but she wasn&#39;t there and all she herd was the upstairs door shut<br />
<br />
&quot;She had to go take care of the babies&quot; said Viki sadly &quot;ok then, I can&#39;t wait to meet them&quot; said Luna before yawning<br />
<br />
&quot;You just go back to sleep Luna, and il see you when you wake up, ok&quot; said Viki, sqeezing Lunas hand &quot;ok auntie Vivi&quot; she said drowzily before her eyes shut, and a light snore could be heard<br />
<br />
It was then that Viki got up and waddled out of the room as fast as she could, wiping her eyes, Lina followed after her.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHY!&quot; Shouted Viki &quot;shes a seventeen year old girl and they straight up butchered her!&quot; She sobbed as she hugged herself, sitting on the sofa.<br />
&quot;Did she have a custom mold like us before?&quot; Asked Lina, putting her hand on Vikis sholder &quot;no she was learning from them to be a successor&quot; said Viki, Linalooked confused &quot;then why was her midsection......like it was&quot; she said, Viki just chuckled &quot;probably because they were convinced she was hiding a baby, knowing her she probably would if she could, she loved those kids&quot; she sighed &quot; and look where that got her&quot;. &quot;she&#39;s alive Viki, at least she&#39;s in there, safe breathing and alive&quot; she said<br />
<br />
&quot;But at what cost&quot; said Viki &quot; you know, she loved to dance&quot; she said sadly laughing at the memories &quot;she would beg me to take her to the ballet whenever I wasn&#39;t full up with kids, and she would watch in amazement throughout the whole thing&quot; she said before laughing &quot;and then she would dance all the way back to the hideout, swinging around lamppost and twirling around on the pavement&quot;<br />
<br />
Then her sad look returned &quot;now how is anyone going to tell her she will never do that again&quot; she cried, burying her head in her hands as Lina held her &quot;I know I couldnt&quot; Said Viki<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s the plan&quot; said Lina &quot; this is something important to you so it&#39;s important to me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no plan&quot; said Viki sounding defeated &quot;there is nothing we CAN do to stand up against that dumb church&quot; as she waddled up the stairs and shut the door, leaving Lina alone with her babies.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is something I can do though&quot; she said as she got out her medallion, a green mist in the shape of surpents suddenly coiling around on the floor as a voice spoke<br />
<br />
&quot;Due to the constant interaction and involvement in this reality, this reality can no longer be shaped or drastically changed&quot; said the medallion, its femanin voice echoing around the room<br />
<br />
&quot;This medallion has now entered wishing well state, the wishes will only alow three more uses and the medallion must be thrown into water in order to work&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to help my friends, I want to help Viki&quot; said Lina determined<br />
<br />
The medallion hummed &quot;your choices are.......&quot;</p>
