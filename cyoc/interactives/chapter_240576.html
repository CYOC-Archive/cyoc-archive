<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some finagling to get the dice in the teenage-baby John’s hand again, John finally threw the dice. He was unaware of the cause-and-effect of his actions, even as his pawn moved to a positive space. <br />
<br />
“Uh-oh,” Ellis said. He rowed doubwe.” <br />
<br />
The other players had been so caught up in getting John to roll that they didn’t realize he was going to be doubling his current age. <br />
<br />
Everyone watched as John’s body matured, though the diapers around his waist did nothing but grow bigger. As he got to his late twenties for the first time, John’s belly began to expand, as did the rest of his frame. Though his hair stayed short and his face stayed shorn, his teenage muscles faded under pounds of chubby fat. John developed a big chest and thighs, and even into his late thirties, he seemingly grew no hair to cover it. <br />
<br />
As John finally settled on 38 years of age, his bulky diapers were growing noticeably wet again. <br />
<br />
“Awe,” Paul said, pinching the cheek of his adult baby brother. “It must have taken a lot out of this little guy to have such a big age change. Do you need another diaper change?”<br />
<br />
John showed the same level of baby brain as before, having stayed unmatured cognitively again. Paul just reached down and methodically patted the front of John’s poofy padding. <br />
<br />
“I think he can hold out for now,” Paul remarked about his brother’s wet diaper. “Not long until the end of the game, I hope. Speaking of which…” He slowly bent down to pick up the dice, grasping at his back in pain. He barely stood up, choosing instead to shake the dice briefly before throwing them on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Two sixes,” Bobbie remarked. “That is doubles for you too!”<br />
<br />
The unspoken truth was that Paul couldn’t possibly get any older, at least, if they believed the game instructions when it said you can’t go lower than 1 or higher than 99. Regardless, the group’s morbid curiosity went away when Paul landed on a negative space. <br />
<br />
“Oof! Finally going back down, I see!” Paul said, already straightening his posture as the game halved his age. <br />
<br />
Paul’s face and body grew younger and stronger, back towards the ages he’d been a few long rounds ago. Back down, through his eighties, seventies, sixties, even fifties, until he landed at about 46 years old. <br />
<br />
“Hey!” Ellis exclaimed. His mind was sharp, though his little body made his toddler speech extra cute! “You guyth are almotht the thame age! ¡Widículo!” <br />
<br />
Tattooed, muscular, and leather-clad Paul looked down at his chubby baby adult brother in a diaper and chuckled. “That we are, sport! And I gotta say, if it weren’t for the fact that John here was my brother, I’d say that this feels right, somehow.” He scratched his chin before shaking his thoughts away. He picked up the dice and handed them to Ellis. “Your turn, squirt!”<br />
<br />
“Fank you!” Ellis said, grabbing the dice with his little toddler hands before tossing them at the board once more. He rolled low, but his pawn moved on its own onto…<br />
<br />
“A thpecial thpace!” Ellis and the group watched as the black orb in the middle of the game board revealed the words “Redhead Recession.” <br />
<br />
“What does that mean,” Bobbie asked, but then her eyes widened as she saw Ellis’ short toddler hair turn into red curly locks just like…<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Hank said. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that Ellis is starting to look like a little version of you.”<br />
<br />
Bobbie realized Hank was right, because Ellis’ changes didn’t stop at his hair. His complexion changed too, growing lighter and more freckled. As the changes stopped, Bobbie could still see Ellis in the face that looked back from her, but he’d been irrevocably changed into a baby that could have easily been her son. <br />
<br />
Ellis giggled, looking at his body, pulling at the hair on his head. He crawled over to a mirror to get a better look. His eyes widened, then he looked back at Bobbie. With a toddler chuckle, he said “Mama?”<br />
<br />
Bobbie instinctively picked up Ellis, still clad in only a diaper, and gave him a maternal squeeze. “That is so odd,” Bobbie said. “I feel like you’re right.”<br />
<br />
Ellis, who had mostly been joking before, suddenly felt the same way. “Did the game make me youw baby?”<br />
<br />
Jack, who until this point had been pouting at the side of the room, started to cackle in his high-pitched toddler laugh. “That is so funny! Guess you better start getting used to getting your diapers changed by your new ‘mommy,’ not to mention sucking on Bobbie’s tit!” Of course, the others could barely understand him, seeing as he had a pacifier locked onto his head. <br />
<br />
His father got the gist, however. “Stop that,” Hank said, raising his voice at his son. “You have no room to babble. You’re a baby just the same, the only difference is that you actually act like one.”<br />
<br />
Jack scrunched up his face and yelled through the pacifier, “FUCK YOU!” With that, he ran out of the room, a blur of toddling baby blue.<br />
“Jack! You naughty boy! Get back here,” Hank yelled as he chased Jack. <br />
<br />
As the father and son left, Bobbie shocked herself from her stupor and picked up the dice. “As cute as you are, I think we need to finish this game so you can be back to your big boy self.” <br />
<br />
Bobbie rolled the dice and got a low roll, moving onto a positive space. The black orb showed a plus two, and Bobbie sighed in relief. <br />
<br />
“Not too bad,” she said as she felt herself age slightly. But just as she said that, she felt her boobs grow heavy, and she felt a pressure in her chest that was completely unrecognizable. She experimentally squeezed her right breast, and yelped in shock as her nipple let loose a bit of wetness.<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” Paul said, having observed Bobbie’s exploration. “I think your body has adjusted to the fact that you have a two year old son.”<br />
<br />
Bobbie looked down at Ellis and noticed that his mouth had begun to water. By instinct, he was reaching up to Bobbie and making grasping hands. And by instinct, Bobbie knew what to do. She picked up the little Ellis once more, pulled aside her blouse, and Ellis immediately found her nipple and began to suck. <br />
<br />
It felt comforting nursing the little redhead, but Bobbie did her best to shake away the feeling that this was normal. “Just a half and hour ago, Ellis and I were making out in the hallway.” She spoke as if Ellis wasn’t sucking on her breast at that very moment. <br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by a new wailing, the sound of a grown man openly crying. Of course, they all turned to John, who was now sitting in a very soggy diaper. <br />
<br />
“How does this boy pee so much?” Paul went over to the wailing boy. Luckily, he found a small pile of supplies that had once again appeared out of thin air. There was a large diaper, a pad that seemed to be for increasing said diaper’s capacity, and a binkie that wrapped around the head and locked in the back. <br />
<br />
“Ah! This should stop the big baby’s whining,” Paul said, grabbing the binky and sticking it in John’s mouth. Comically, John stopped wailing and started sucking, not struggling a bit as Paul locked the contraption around his head. <br />
<br />
“Hehe,” Paul said, admiring his handiwork. He nodded at Bobbie, who was still nursing Ellis. “Looks like my baby just needed something to suck on as well.” <br />
<br />
“Hey,” Bobbie said. “I hope you’re not getting any ideas. I’m not having a nearly forty old man suck on my boobs.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no,” Paul said with a chuckle. “That won’t be necessary. Now, time to get this pee pants man into a diaper that is more his size.”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Hank had lost track of Jack quickly, having to contend with the fact that Jack knew all of the best hiding places in the house, despite being dressed head to toe as a baby in a big, floofy diaper. <br />
<br />
Despite hiding underneath his father’s bed, Jack knew that he was noisy and crinkly. He was also trying to catch his breath after having to run away with a pacifier blocking his mouth. <br />
<br />
Jack thought back to the action that had got him in this mess, trying to cheat. There was no way he could win at this stupid game now. He’d be stuck as a little baby until they were done playing. He hated it. Even now, he could feel himself wetting his diaper involuntarily, a far cry from the ages where he’d been allowed to be a sexy grown-up and jerk off. Even if he had to be a baby, if he ran away so he couldn’t do his turn, the game would never end, and everyone else would have to stay their ages the same way. <br />
<br />
“Got you!” <br />
<br />
Jack squealed as his father appeared in front of him, having leaned down to look under the bed. He squirmed his way back to the other side, intent on going around the other way to escape. Alas, Hank was too fast for him. <br />
<br />
As Hank snatched Jack off the floor, he said, “You think I don’t know all your tricks? We’ve done all this before, little stinker.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not stinky!” Jack tried to say through his pacifier. <br />
<br />
“You’re cute, trying to talk.” Hank said, patting Jack’s little diapered bottom. “Time to accept your punishment and move on.”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
When Hank and Jack got back into the room, Bobbie (with Ellis still breastfeeding) was standing over John while Paul changed his diaper. <br />
<br />
“You’re right,” Bobbie said. “His penis is pretty small.”<br />
<br />
“I wonder if he’ll grow up to have a two-incher with little baby nuts,” Paul mused, wiping John’s crotch. “It might just be the magic of the game.”<br />
<br />
“Only time will tell,” Hank replied, holding a baby-cackling Jack. <br />
<br />
Hank looked at the board. The black orb in the middle was waiting for him to go. “Look at that, son,” he said. “It skipped you! Looks like the game really is keeping you at two years old.”<br />
<br />
Jack stopped cackling and started pouting again. It wasn’t fair. <br />
<br />
Hank kneeled down and grabbed the dice once more. He threw them onto the board, another high roll. Despite that, it was a negative space, and the black orb showed a -9. <br />
<br />
As he grew shorter, Hank found Jack harder to carry. He quickly placed Jack on his own bed as he felt his adult frame narrow and grow youthful once again. Pimples popped out over his face, while his hair grew more full. He grew shorter, and his clothes shifted into a polo shirt and shorts. Soon he looked like a dorky teenager. <br />
<br />
“Are you having fun, Hank,” Paul asked, having gotten over his nervousness to use his friend’s dad’s real name. “Looks like you were a cute kid.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess I was,” Hank said, looking in the mirror. “Though, I think I liked it before this, when I had less pimples.”<br />
<br />
With that, round eight was done. John doubled his age and grew up to 38 years old, finally bigger in age and size (though still not mannerisms or potty training). Paul halved his age and was back down to middle age at 46. Ellis stayed 2, but got the oddest special change yet by making him a redhead and seemingly genetically tied to Bobbie, who only grew two years (and two breast sizes) to 24. Jack, of course, stayed 2 years old, but no more mischievous. And Hank regressed to teenager status at 13 years old.</p>
