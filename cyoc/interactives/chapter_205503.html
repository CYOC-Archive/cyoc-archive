<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh... oh man this is amazing...&quot; Alan looked back and forth between the two passages for a minute, just drinking in the beauty. The <i>magic.</i><br />
<br />
However, he had no inclination to explore either at the moment: He had to show the others! He turned and practically ran back up the tunnel. Fortunately, as he left the crystal behind, his flashlight flickered and came back to full power, allowing him to see his way.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Ricky leaned on his walking stick, breathing heavily, sweat pouring down his face and into his clothes. A few yards ahead the cave opened to the outside, just as Ethan had predicted; he could see grass and moss lapping at the cave mouth as well as clouds in the blue sky above. Ethan had gone on, eager to see what he had discovered; but Ricky <i>had</i> to take a break.<br />
<br />
Apart from physical exhaustion, he also felt that something was wrong. There was an off vibe from that opening ahead. Or maybe it was just concern for Alan.<br />
<br />
Ethan certainly hadn&#39;t hesitated to step into the sunlight, his silhouette disappearing up the continuing slope until all Ricky could see were his feet. He heard him well enough however as Ethan exclaimed with an unusual note of awe in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God! Hurry up, Ricky! You <i>have</i> to see this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... okay,&quot; he grumbled. The way Ethan sounded elicited a grudging curiosity. So he swallowed his foreboding, wiped the sweat from his eyes, and pushed himself up the last few steps out of the cave.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t immediately see what had so impressed Ethan; as he had noted, the upward slope continued outside of the tunnel. He also realised, as his eyes adjusted back to daylight, that there was a slightly worn path in the grass up the hill, which he began to trudge along.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, dude? Isn&#39;t it...&quot; Ethan trailed off, words failing him, as Ricky caught up with him. The chubby blond blinked in wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
Beneath his feet the faint trail turned into pavement, a clean path leading straight into the heart of a valley nestled deep amongst high, pine-clad mountains. The path terminated at the base of a small temple or shrine, a rectangular, low-sloped roof supported by fluted Corinthian columns. A classical gem they would never have expected in the Cascades.<br />
<br />
But the real wonder was the statues. Beautiful, life-sized marble women, all nude, all posed to show off their lovely breasts. Fondling them, caressing them, presenting them in a dazzling variety of female sensuality. They stood atop marble pedestals in pairs, beginning about halfway down the path, lining the way to the shrine.<br />
<br />
Without further talk the two young men began to walk down the path. Ricky&#39;s hesitation was completely gone now, replaced by awe and desire. His cock reached full mast, as did Ethan&#39;s, long before they actually got to the statues, but there was something different about the lust they felt. As they passed in between the smiling effigies, a tingle washed over the boys. They felt something other than mere sexual desire; a <i>reverence</i> for the bodies, the bosoms displayed around them.<br />
<br />
Suddenly they felt a presence ahead of them in the shrine. Both of them looked forward, and their breath caught as they saw a goddess step to the front of the portico. That word was what immediately came to their minds -- she was walking perfection: skin tanned and unblemished; eyes deep and dark; hair long, black and lustrous. She was clad in a robe of white, arranged so that it cradled the large, round expanses of her smooth, naked breasts.<br />
<br />
The boys blushed, stumbling to a halt. Statues were one thing, but a living woman showing herself off? They weren&#39;t sure how to handle that. Though, despite them both trying to be polite, they couldn&#39;t keep their eyes off her olive-skinned mounds, capped by dark areolae and perfect nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, travelers.&quot; Her voice had a lyric quality to it, musical and almost hypnotically suggestive. &quot;Welcome to my valley. I am Mammorea; you mortals would call me a nymph.&quot; She set her hands on her bosom, gently running her fingers down the swelling flesh. Gently laughing as the boys stared hungrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the <i>genius,</i> the guardian spirit of this, the Valley of Sculpted Breasts, where I create and preserve female beauty. Few of your kind are granted this blessing now-a-days, and I am pleased to see you appreciate the honour. But you must be tired and thirsty after your long trek through the darkness. Come, refresh yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again they advanced without speaking, words lost in the pull that her breasts exerted on them. Their walking sticks fell to the path, rolling away forgotten. Packs followed, and soon all their kit was littered behind them. Mammorea came down the steps of the shrine&#39;s raised platform to meet them, stopping on the last before the path.<br />
<br />
They halted awkwardly in front of her. Ricky&#39;s mouth was dry, anticipating he knew not what as he stared at the large, heavy mass of tit in front of him, the fat brown nipple staring back at him like a mesmerist.<br />
<br />
Beside him he heard Ethan mumble something. Something like &quot;Sorry, you&#39;re so beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t apologise, my dears,&quot; the nymph responded. Her hands slid down, cupping her mammaries, lifting the pendulous globes free of their cloth cradles. &quot;Soon, you will be beautiful too. Now drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
A faint echo of his former concern buzzed in the back of Ricky&#39;s brain. What did she mean by that? But... he was really tired, and thirsty. And she smelled so good. Like honey, and vanilla, with just a hint of earthy womanliness. His mouth was watering. He <i>needed</i> to <i>taste her.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Is... is it okay...&quot; Ethan spoke heavily, as if struggling with sleep. A gentleman to the last, he just couldn&#39;t wrap his head around this stranger offering to breastfeed him and the couch potato out in the open, even if there was nobody else around. But the woman -- the nymph -- laughed, and his inhibitions faded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I insist, my dear. Please. Drink and be filled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her melodic voice banished their last lingering recognition of how strange and out of place this was. Why would they refuse? It was the opportunity of a lifetime -- to drink form the nectar of the gods! Each boy took a breast in his hands, marvelling at the weight as they lifted the teat to their parched lips, the feel of the soft firmness. The pressure pushed out beads of milk, doubling their <i>need</i> as the sweet scent hit them. They licked the pearlescent moisture from the stiffened nipples, gasping at the flavour as a deep, satisfied <i>&quot;mmmm&quot;</i> resonated from the nymph.<br />
<br />
She let her devotees enjoy the full weight of her bounty as she drew her hands away to place them on the blond heads, stroking their hair and pulling them closer. Having tasted her, they could do nothing but suck her nipples into their mouths, lips sealing around them as more heavenly white fluid flowed across their tongues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, drink deep, my dears,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Let my power fill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They obeyed, suckling greedily. Thin at first, the milk became thicker as they drew it out. Thicker, creamier, sweeter; but never cloying. In between gulps, they laved their tongue in the wonderful texture, while just as eagerly sucking in her perfumed scent through their nostrils. Their whole world was now the taste, scent, sight and feel of the nymph&#39;s breasts and their bounty.<br />
<br />
Mammorea continued to encourage them with soft words, until she felt them pull the cream from the deepest roots of her lactic treasury. Then she kissed the tops of their heads; first Ricky on her left, then Ethan on her right. With deep sighs, they lifted their heads. They felt full, satisfied as they never had been by any meal, and they stepped back, licking their lips. She returned her hands to her breasts, smearing traces of milk and saliva over them so they shone, bouncing them a little.<br />
<br />
<i>Breasts.</i> The thought remained the only thing in the boys&#39; heads as they watched her, transfixed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; she murmured, smile gracing her lips. &quot;You have seen and tasted. You know how wonderful breasts are.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>So wonderful.</i> Neither Ricky nor Ethan knew if they spoke the assent aloud. Looking up at her with glazed adoration, still fixated on her leaking mmamries, they did not notice as their bodies slimmed down, shoulders drawing together and backs arching as their body hair faded. They rubbed at their own chests, increasingly sensitive beneath their shirts. Soft moans escaped plumper lips, thicker legs squirming as pressure began to tug on their manhoods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... show me yours...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Yes...</i><br />
<br />
Ethan lost a few inches, his hair growing down to his shoulders in a wavy fall of gold. He pulled his t-shirt up and cast it aside, then cupped his own growing tits, smiling in amazement as they blossomed from B-cup to C, to D, almost hiding his hands until he began massaging his nipples.<br />
<br />
His breath caught, and he squirmed harder as his once-proud penis finished its retreat into his body, a cute little button inside its fleshy hood; his once-virile balls vanished, leaving a female flower to bloom wetly in their wake. His pants and underwear unraveled soundlessly around the luscious swell of his hips and ass, falling in a heap of thread around his dainty feet. Exposing his -- her? -- nethers to the kiss of the breeze, and the possessive gaze of the nymph.<br />
<br />
It was happening so quickly... was he a girl now? He still felt like a boy -- but he had breasts! That was all he could think about, scarcely registering the other changes, even as femjuice dampened his inner thighs.<br />
<br />
Next to him, Ricky ripped through the buttons on his sweat-soaked shirt, anxious to get the rank garment off and show this goddess how beautiful his bust was. He did not lose height, but his fat smoothed out, shifting from unsightly gut to fill out her curves, leaving him larger in every way than Ethan.<br />
<br />
Yes, her bust was surely beautiful -- she hefted the heavy, teardrop-shaped melons, shivering at the pleasure and the weight. <i>Supple, firm, heavy and smooth -- just like Hers.</i> Like Ethan&#39;s had, her lower garments simply melted away from her, exposing the glory of her thick hips and huge, cushiony, heart-shaped ass. tickled by the reddish blond cascade of her long, lustrous hair.<br />
<br />
Wait, was she a girl? No, that couldn&#39;t be. But... he felt so beautiful... his breasts...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Mammorea&#39;s soft voice wound into them, binding their thoughts with sweet obedience. &quot;Attend to them. Your breasts are beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Yes! They&#39;re so beautiful!</i> The former boys could do nothing but gaze down and marvel at their new breasts. So they did not notice as their discarded gear and clothing dissolved into swirls of light that lifted them up, then coalesced beneath them into marble pedestals. <i>Breasts... I have such wonderful breasts... Look at them!</i> Instinctively they shifted a little, adopting the sexiest pose to show off their bodies and emphasise their pride in their fulsome chests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, let me preserve them for you... forever...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before they could react, the marble flowed over their feet, up their legs and torsos, freezing them in the act of admiring their new bosoms; their flesh and hair transmuted to ageless, pristine white stone. Ethan&#39;s fingers were splayed around his nipples, still gazing down at them in disbelieving happiness. Ricky meanwhile was looking shyly up through his lashes -- now stone so delicate it was almost translucent -- lifting his pendulous milk jugs as if offering them for approval.<br />
<br />
<i>Look at us!</i><br />
<br />
They both trembled inside with this thought, their minds a bright slurry of need to have their breasts touched, looked at, <i>appreciated.</i> They barely comprehended what had happened to them; they felt heavy and saw their pale boobs and rosy nipples turn a uniform white, but their need left no room for fear or even surprise. They could still feel the breeze on them, cooling the former heat of their bodies to cold stone. Drying the residue of sweat and female lube. Caressing their nipples and vaginas with teasing love. They could see too, and hear; they simply could not move. Passively waiting for others to come and fulfill their need to be seen and desired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sculpted to perfection,&quot; Mammorea said, nodding in approval. &quot;For me to keep and love, and use as I wish. For as I gave to you, so should you give to me...&quot; Mammorea stepped down onto the path. &quot;Let me have a taste...&quot; She bent down, running her fingers over Ricky&#39;s chest. <i>Oh God!</i> he cried silently. It felt so good! He felt like -- like --<br />
<br />
Mammorea kissed his nipple. The marble receded, leaving a quivering, fleshy nub which the nymph closed her lips on, and <i>sucked.</i> Pink milk squirted from Ricky in orgasm, strawberry milk. His own unique flavour for the nymph&#39;s pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; The nymph took a few sips, each one electrifying the petrified girl afresh, before pulling away. As she finished with it, the living nipple turned back to stone. Waiting until next Mammorea wanted to taste her marble maiden&#39;s hidden sweetness.<br />
<br />
Then it was Ethan&#39;s turn. He had sensed Ricky&#39;s release, and strained against his marble body to hasten his own. But he could do nothing, just wait and begin to realise his predicament. Perhaps sensing this, the nymph took her time, letting her fingers play over the super-sensitive surface of Ethan&#39;s body before finally leaning in to sip from his yielding teat, the marble retreating before her questing lips.<br />
<br />
<i>Ahhhhhhh!</i> Did anybody hear Ethan&#39;s voiceless scream? Flashes of blinding white pleasure obscured his vision as he looked down on the nymph sucking thick honey from his breast. Or rather, mead; golden, heady fermented nectar.<br />
<br />
Finishing with her taste test, Mammorea reached out and pulled the new statues to her, tucking one under each arm. The stimulation of her touch made them unable to process it, but the nymph was obviously much, <i>much</i> stronger than she looked. She strolled down the path until she reached the end of the statues, and placed one on each side of the path, facing each other. Around them, they could sense the other statues; a strange cocktail of welcome, of despair and sorrow, and of endless desire and orgasm.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real,&quot; Alan muttered as he watched the nymph approach, the feminised and petrified bodies of his friends held easily in her arms, pedestals and all.<br />
<br />
He had come out of the tunnel just as Ethan and Ricky had finished their drink from the nymph&#39;s enchanting bosom. He had quickly ducked behind a tree, and watched their transformation from young men into erotic female statues with horror. And shameful arousal, the nymph&#39;s magical perfection affecting him despite not being the intended target. Now the nymph -- the monster -- had ensconced them alongside the others.<br />
<br />
What should he do? Run back to town? What could the people there do against a <i>bona fide</i> supernatural being? Maybe there was something else in this valley? Or -- his mind flashed back to the glowing crystals. Maybe he could find a power of his own there that would let him face her and break the spell she&#39;d cast on his friends? </p>
