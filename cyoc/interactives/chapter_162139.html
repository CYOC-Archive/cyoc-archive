<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adronas has been walking down the mountain for about an hour now. She was too scared to attempt to fly with her new body. Despite that walking in this new body was still much faster than on two legs. She got used to walking on four limbs pretty quickly and after 40 minutes it was harder to imagine walking on two legs. She was thinking about how to solve this problem while walking down the mountain.<br />
Her current plan was to find another player and get them to tell an admin or someone about the glitch and get out of this broken game.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the smell of meat hit her. With her new and refined sense of smell, the scent of the meat and blood was divine. She changed her route and followed the scent of raw meat.<br />
<br />
After walking for about 10 minutes, she saw the source of the scent. It was a dead deer. It was just lying there in a small clearing of the shrubby bushes which cover most of the hills here.<br />
Andronas slowly walked over to it and was about to take a bite when she heard some incantation, was blinded by a bright light and fell unconscious.<br />
<br />
She woke up again a few hours later. She felt that she was in a carriage. But couldn&#39;t see anything. Her maw was put in a metal muzzle and there was something tied over her eyes. Her front and back feet were tied together with some magically strong leather. And her Wings were tucked to her body with the same material.<br />
She could hear people talk in the drivers seat of the carriage, but she could not understand the language. They sounded happy.<br />
There seemed to be multiple carriages around here going in the same direction. She guessed there were about three.<br />
<br />
&quot;These people probably are poachers,&quot; thought Andranos, &quot;and I am just some rare animal they have captured.&quot;<br />
&quot;At least I am still alive,&quot; she thought, &quot;this means that they probably need me alive.&quot; &quot;Unless they just wanted to keep the meat fresh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andranos suddenly hit the reality of the situation. She started breaking down. She didn&#39;t want to get sold to some rich noble. This all wasn&#39;t even meant to be possible! This was all supposed to just be a game! Why would there even be poachers in some random RPG? And how could this be so realistic? Is this an alternate reality? Does Andrew the human even exist anymore?<br />
<br />
Despite trying her best, she couldn&#39;t change anything. Andranos could hear the carriage getting closer to civilization and with that getting closer to selling her. She heard horses and other carriages cross paths and the road went from a dirt road to a gravel one.<br />
After collectively about 3 hours the carriage has arrived at some kind of castle town.<br />
<br />
The carriage stopped, and she heard the coachman get off. He said something to presumably a guard and they opened the gates to the town. Inside the town Andranos could hear many humans talking and smelt many strange foods.<br />
Slowly the voices became quieter again as the carriage was moving towards the outskirts of the town.<br />
Abruptly it stopped and all the rider got off. She could hear several shrieks and growls as the creatures from the other carriages were taken out and presumably put into some kind of a holding cage.<br />
After the smaller creatures were all taken she could hear the canvas covering of her carriage being pulled away. She could hear two people talk and shortly after heard another Magic Incantation and blacked out once again.<br />
<br />
When she woke up, she was in some kind of stone pen. It was just big enough to let her lie down and turn around but not much more.<br />
The bindings of her feet and the cover from her eyes were gone and the muzzle has been replaced with a less tight leather one. <br />
In one corner of the room, was a trough filled with some raw meat.<br />
Usually, this would have looked disgusting but to her new body it seemed delicious. She has been in this body for at least a day now so she has become quite hungry. So she decided to take a bite. At first it seemed weird to eat with just your mouth and to not even chew the meat, but she got used to it very fast. Eating with a fork just seemed overly complicated now.<br />
After having finished her meal Andranos felt a little better. She may have been kidnapped in a strange fantasy world while in the body of a dragoness but at least she wont die anytime soon.<br />
That reminds her; her body is truly female now. There seemed to always be more important things to worry about than her sex, but it truly changed. Between her back legs was a horizontal slit covered by the scutes on her belly. She tried to touch it with her front legs but couldn&#39;t. The range of movement of her new legs was limited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah there are probably even now still more important things to worry about...,&quot; thought Andranos and laid down, &quot;and I&#39;ll worry about it all tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tomorrow is the big mythical beast auction in this castle town where many people buy rare creatures like Unicorns, Pegasi, Wyverns and also Dragons.</p>
