<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I didn't have any sense of time in the crate. All I was aware of was some movement <br />
and then some voices. The crate was opened and I was taken out. A woman was <br />
looking at a piece of paper then said, &quot;Ok get it dressed in a school uniform. Since it <br />
has a bit of a bust put a white sports bra on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we use the winter uniform?&quot; a man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use your brain for once,&quot; the woman said. &quot;Is it winter yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the man answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has school started yet?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It starts next week,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what uniform do you suppose we put on this mannequin?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The summer uniform,&quot; the mam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right,&quot; the woman said and her tone made it clear she had been over <br />
something like this with the man before. &quot;Now get this mannequin dressed.&quot; The <br />
woman left the man and a girl to dress me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that she was a mannequin then maybe we'd have a better boss,&quot; the man <br />
grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you really don't think before asking something,&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was I suppose to know what uniform to put on it?&quot; the man asked sounding hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you had thought about it you would have figured it out,&quot; the girl said with a <br />
sigh. &quot;Lets go get the clothes.&quot; They left for a few minutes and when they came back <br />
the girl said, &quot;Ok now we can dress her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you refer to these mannequins as him and her?&quot; the man asked rolling his <br />
eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do men refer to cars and ships as she?&quot; the girl shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's different,&quot; the man said defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right there is a difference,&quot; the girl said. &quot;While cars, boats, and mannequins <br />
are all inanimate objects mannequins at least look human. And why is it always that <br />
cars and ships are always a she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They just are,&quot; the man said shrugging. &quot;Perhaps we can get it dressed before the <br />
witch comes back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl rolled her eyes at one of those comments or maybe both. They started by <br />
putting a pair of plain white cotton panties on me. It was weird because they did it <br />
while I was still completely disassembled. I figured out why when they put a pair of <br />
white pantyhose on me. They only pulled both up my right leg until they were a little <br />
below crotch then stuffed my left leg in them. Once they had done that they connected <br />
my left leg and pulled them up a little more stopping below my hips. I could see that if <br />
they had tried to put them on with my lower half together they wouldn't have been able <br />
to. They slipped on a pair of black shoes that had a strap across the top about <br />
halfway down my foot. They then stood me on the base and I felt the rod go up my <br />
heel into my leg. I didn't understand how that could be then I guessed that there was a <br />
hole in the shoe and pantyhose so I could be stood on the base. The girl took a red <br />
pleated skirt and unzipped the hidden side zip then put it on my lower half letting it fall <br />
down my legs a bit. Then they picked up my upper half and connected it to my lower <br />
half. I saw why they had left the panties and pantyhose down below my hips since they <br />
came up over my hips and would have been caught when they put my upper half on. <br />
The girl slipped a sports bra over my head and down onto my chest. I lost sight of <br />
them as they went behind me but I could feel them putting my arms through sleeves. <br />
Soon they were connecting my arms and hands. The girl came around buttoned up <br />
what I was wearing and pulled the skirt into position. She then buttoned something <br />
else and then put something around my neck. I heard a snap then the girl fussed with <br />
what I could only assume was a collar and pulled my hair out from the back.<br />
<br />
The girl looked me up and down then said, &quot;I think her hair would look good in a <br />
ponytail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want no part of that,&quot; the man said. &quot;You know how the witch hates people messing <br />
with the mannequins' hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh a ponytail will be easy to take out if she doesn't like it,&quot; the girl said sighing. She <br />
then takes a brush to your hair and after a few minutes you feel her tugging it. <br />
&quot;There,&quot; she said coming to stand in front of you again. &quot;Now we can put her out on <br />
the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man picks you up and the girl picks up the base. As they start walking the girl tells <br />
the guy to be careful. They get you out onto the floor in good shape and put you up. <br />
The girl fussed with your clothes a bit and steps back just as their boss comes up. <br />
&quot;Well you managed to get it dressed alright,&quot; she said. &quot;Now there's some clothes that <br />
need to be put back where they belong.&quot; The man and girl went to put the clothes <br />
back and the woman looked at you with a curious expression on her face. She shook <br />
her head and mumbled, &quot;If I didn't know any better I would say it was alive.&quot; She then <br />
left still shaking her head slightly.<br />
<br />
During the rest of the day you stood there watching the people that came into sight. <br />
You were in the girl's department so most of the people you saw were girls and the <br />
discussions centered mainly around clothes and boys. There was the occasional girl <br />
who would shudder when they saw you and remark to their friends how they had <br />
heard about the mannequins moving by themselves at night. One girl swore that her <br />
older brother who was a night guard in the mall<br />
actually saw the mannequins move. Her friend shook her head and told her that she <br />
was being ridiculous and that there was no way the mannequins could move by <br />
themselves. I knew that it was possible for for something to move by itself. I had been <br />
transformed twice already so it wasn't a stretch of the imagination to think that <br />
mannequins might be able to move by themselves. About two hours after those girls <br />
had left a girl passed by me. She looked at me and smiled then she did something I <br />
didn't expect, she winked at me. It was almost as if she knew I could see her. How <br />
could she though? Could she somehow know that I was a real person before? I guess <br />
I wouldn't know unless she decided to tell me and that didn't seem likely.</p>
