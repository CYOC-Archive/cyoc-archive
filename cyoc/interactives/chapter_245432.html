<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week passed, and Emily flourished from access to excellent sex from her next door neighbor to fill her succubus needs. Both Emily and Clara were comfortably to their double lives as career women by day and monsters by night. <br />
<br />
Yet while Clara was perfectly content with her new friend with benefits, she knew in her soul that she was not complete yet. In her gut she felt that she was still half her potential. The flower nourished her, and she it, but not truly to the maximum capacity. She simply could not sustain her garden on her own, she still needed a mate to realize her full potential.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Clara knew that her big chance would be soon. For the month, she’d be hosting  her best friend from all the way back to high school, who fit everything Clara would now desire in a partner. Penny was a fellow nature lover, an athlete and adventurer compared to the homebody Clara, and an outgoing extroverted personality to compliment and balance the introverted Emily. Of course, achingly beautiful, that too.<br />
<br />
Emily had prepared a relatively lavish welcome for her temporary guest, a dinner, a movie night, and crucially, an outdoor bonfire in her backyard. Clara was greeted with a huge hug from her tall friend that knocked her breath away. Clara and Penny were both amazed at how different one another looked. Clara, of course, was now much more voluptuous and shapely even in her human disguise. Penny meanwhile had grown her hair longer than when they last met on college break. Her bronze skin was smooth and featured toned arms and a tight core shown off courtesy of her halter top. Her jeans too were tight and pleasantly showed the curve of her firm glutes. Penny spun her around as they grappled in a tight hug, Clara was completely distracted as she got a whiff of her scent, already sinking deep into infatuation beyond that of just an old friend.<br />
<br />
Come the end of the night, Clara and Penny had made it out to the garden with a bottle of wine, intending to sit out under the sunset. Unbeknownst to Penny, her attention was drawn to the massive scarlet flower that took up almost a quarter of the relatively tiny backyard.<br />
<br />
“Hey Clar… the big plant, where’d you get it? It looks impressive, smells amazing too.” Penny asked.<br />
<br />
She beamed with excitement. “It’s called an Alraune. They grow in New Guinea, produce their own edible nectar, too! Want to take a closer look?” <br />
<br />
“It’s not gonna grow lips and try to eat me, right?” Penny snickered.<br />
<br />
Clara giggled. “I’d me more worried for myself if that were it! She got up and walked over to her source of strength. The closer to the flower she got, the harder it became to maintain a human appearance.<br />
<br />
Partly to humor her friend, partly because the smell really was that enticing, Penny followed her. Getting closer, she leaned forward to see the large nectar pit in the pod at the flower’s center. She was breathing in boatloads of pheromones, and Penny’s eyes widened with wonder. “It’s soo pretty… wow!” She gasped.<br />
<br />
“It gets better, check this.” Emily abruptly walked into the flower and the petals closed up around her, spitting her clothes out in a soaked pile. The flower reopened to unveil Clara in her full green glory. “Ta-da!” She grinned, hand on her hip.<br />
<br />
“Clara?!” Penny stammered. “Why are you green?!” <br />
<br />
“This is just how I am now! The flower and I are sorta one now…” Clara stuck her fingers in the nectar and offered it to Penny. “And so could you, if you want.”<br />
<br />
The sweet amber syrup made her pupils dilate and her tongue to weigh heavy in her mouth. Without thinking twice, she scraped the nectar off her fingers and tasted it with the tip of her tongue. It tasted like Heaven on her lips and she exhaled in wonder. “I could… join you, like in the flower?”<br />
<br />
“You could be a part of it, be a part of me… I already feel like you are a part of me Penny. Will you let me be a part of you?”<br />
<br />
“That was really sappy Clara.” She smirked, but stepped forward anyway. Her toes tickled as she stepped into the flower. The nectar in her system acted fast to root Penny to the flower, connecting her nervous system with that of the plant, and with Clara herself. Soon, both girls realized they could feel each other, like their body was an extension of the other’s. Clara shivered and bit her lip with pleasure as Emily touched her own breasts,  moving closer to Penny. “Good, good. Now hold me close.” She cupped the back of Penny’s neck. “Drink my sap…”<br />
<br />
Penny did as asked and knelt down, her jeans dissolving as she sank deeper into the nectar. Her breath hitched as she brought her lips to Clara’s nipple, her lips close enough that the air from her lips made them stand upright, and for her’s to similarly stiffen. She began to drink the nectar from her as it dribbled from Clara’s breast, and the more she tasted, the more she needed. She failed to notice as the rest of her clothes began to melt just as her jeans were, leaving her bare and exposed. As she drank, her lips first began to turn a dark green, spreading to the rest of her face. Her ears elongated like and elf and her long brown hair changed as well, turning a beautiful lavender. As her hair changed, half the petals of the flower did the same, becoming a beautiful union of both their hues.<br />
<br />
“Taste the sweetest of all, Penny… from my fertility…” Clara breathily instructed. Dutifully, Penny got on her knees, soaking her in the nectar as her fingers held tight around Clara’s hips. Clara herself pushed her face forward, and plunged her into the petals of Clara’s womanhood. Her folds, warm and slick with sweet plant fluid, did indeed taste the most intoxicating of all. Clara and Penny started shaking I’m unison as Clara’s pleasure was shared with Penny, the work of her own tongue echoing in the corridors of her own vagina. Her skin was utterly green now, and she moaned as her breasts began to grow, fondled tenderly by Clara’s other hand. Her chest became larger, though Clara still obviously was the larger. What was bigger on Penny was the big and pillowy ass that she now sat on. Her thighs grew thick and succulent, her hips broad and sturdy as they sloped down from a thin and muscular four pack of a core. <br />
<br />
Clara squeaked and Penny’s eyes flashed emerald green as Penny fully adopted her Alraune form, linking the two women in mind and soul as well as body. Every secret, every tic, every facet and form of their characters, all of it was an open library between them now. It was as though discovering even deeper depths of someone they knew better than almost anyone. Penny got up on her feet, resting her head on Clara’s chest as they heir each other in a soulful embrace.<br />
<br />
“I love you Clara. I think I always did…”<br />
<br />
“I think so too…” Clara Cooed as they shared an intimate and tender kiss.</p>
