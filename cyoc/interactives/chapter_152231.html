<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The computer tablet was full of so many options that Jessica and Amber couldn’t really decide, Jessica could have let Amber pick the monster but spending her vacation as some horror monster wasn’t the idea of a fun time for Jessica and Amber tomboyish wouldn&#39;t accept something “too girly”<br />
<br />
The two of them where going back and forth for a while until the receptionist cleared her voice.<br />
<br />
“If I may.” Said the Receptionist “It sounds like Miss Randell wants to be semi-human while you Amber want something more powerful, am I correct?”<br />
<br />
“Basically.” Admitted Amber as Jessica nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“Well if I may offer a middle ground.” Said the Receptionist as she took the pad and pulled up the Creature.<br />
<br />
“Mermaid?” inquired Jessica, that was a creature she would like but the look on Amber face said it was a no go.<br />
<br />
“Mermaid…that is too girlly.” Said Amber <br />
<br />
“Really?” inquired the Receptionist with a knowing smirk as she hit a side bar. “For a small up charge we can change you into this kind of mermaid.”<br />
<br />
Amber’s eyes widened as she looked at the mermaid, instead of the fish tail it had the tail of a shark with the sharp fins and deadly look. <br />
<br />
“Well that is better?” admitted Amber “Can I decide what kind of shark?”<br />
<br />
“You can.” Confirmed the Receptionist<br />
<br />
“But what about the rules that children must become the same monster?” inquired Jessica<br />
<br />
“You are the same type of monster, this shark form is a sub group of mermaid and well within the rules.” explained the Receptionist. “This is a good middle ground I feel personally.”<br />
<br />
Jessica looked at her daughter who was still looking at the image of the shark mermaid and decided then that this was the best route.<br />
<br />
“Alright, how much is the upgrade?” inquired Jessica and to her amazement the upgrade wasn’t too bad. She paid it and then they where off. <br />
<br />
Since they where becoming water creatures, they had to journey to the other side of the dome which extended under the water but didn’t have direct access to the sea. They didn’t want a real shark or another creature which could hurt a guest get them. <br />
<br />
“Alright, you need to place the transformation underwear on, we don’t want to walk around nude before we turn. As for tops we have a few options for tops.” Said the transforming agent, the underwear was flesh color and would be absorbed into the body when turned. Then she held up multiple different styles of bras and tops. “Or Miss Randell you can go topless, being underage your daughter must have one on.”<br />
“I like this one.” Said Jessica as she picked out a top which looked like it was made of different pieces of nets, seaweed and had multiple teeth along it. “It will look better than some girly seashell one.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll take this.” Said Miss Randell as she picked out a modern sports bra which had seashells and the like attached to it, giving it the look of being natural but with the comforts of modern design. A quick change and they where done.<br />
<br />
“Good please follow me to the transformation tanks.” said the agent as the two of them where led into a long room with multiple standing tanks. Two of them where open and an oxygen max was hanging over them.   <br />
<br />
“Step in and place the mask on, it will provide oxygen while you turn.” Explained the agent as Amber all but ran into her tank and strapped on the mask before holding out her arm for her injection of transformation agent. Jessica was slower getting into her tank so she wasn’t surprise to see her daughter’s tank door close before she had even placed her mask on. “Good on tank 2.”<br />
<br />
The tank filled with water as Jessica watched her daughter transform as the agent checked her own mask and tank, the first change she actually noticed was her daughter’s ear, they had become pointed and shot out the side of her short hair. Her skin tone was also changing to take on a darker tone more a kin to a shark, then she saw the gills form along the side of her neck and after a second or two the mask fell away and her daughter looked around in her tank. The underwear was absorbed into her new tail, as two powerful fins formed out of the side of her hips while along her back a shark tail fin formed. More smaller fins formed along her merged legs which where expending out as well. Finally, her main tail fin formed straight up and down instead of side to side like a normal mermaid, multiple dark strips also appeared her daughters back and tail. <br />
<br />
“Tiger shark mermaid.” Said Jessica into her mask, smiling a bit at the look of joy on her daughter’s face, even as she held out her own arm and got injected. Her own tank filled with water and it was now her daughter’s turn to watch. She had also customized her own transformation and she smiled as she notice her first change, her hair which floated in the tank had changed and was becoming a neon blue color and while she couldn’t see it she knew her eyes where becoming a brighter shade of that blue. Then she looked down and noticed that the bottom of the tank was now gone and her legs where extending outward. Looking down she noticed her legs form being pulled together as skin rapidly grew over the gap merging the two limbs into one. Once done the skin began to harden and change into scales, scales which where silver in color with a few neon blue here and there and bands of blue along the back of her new tail. She didn’t get fins on the side or back like her daughter and her tail fin was horizontal like a classic mermaid. She was so focus on the change she didn’t even notice when her own oxygen mask fell away and she took her first breaths of sea water.<br />
<br />
“All done.” Said a voice from the underwater speakers “Swim down and a guild will meet you to show you around, enjoy your stay.”<br />
<br />
Jessica smiled this was a great middle ground or water as she swam down the small tub toward “open” water. She could be a semi-girly mermaid while her daughter could be the terror of the deep mer-shark, a win win. Now they would meet their guild and start their vacation.</p>
