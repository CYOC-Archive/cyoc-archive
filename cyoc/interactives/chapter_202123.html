<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter and the preceeding chapter were borrowed from the tg caption &quot;A Spelling Mistake&quot; by Senor Incognito with some additions and revisions added by myself. <br/>
Please check the rest of Senor Incognito&#39;s other creations on their patreon and Deviantart.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Aya hurriedly scribbled the words on to the scroll, she imagined the future that surely awaited. Soon, she would have to put up with her sorority sisters mocking her for her skinny body no more! &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Aya hummed to herself, &quot;We&#39;ll see who&#39;s laughing when they see their boyfriends are drooling at the sight of me and who&#39;s got the bigger boobies!&quot; She giggled when she said that last word, intending it to be a jab at those bitchy bimbos.<br />
<br />
A mature body, big fat tits, and a nice juicy ass, it would all be hers. Pretty soon, she would be the one that the boys on campus would be chasing and rushing to open doors for, ogling and admiring her body as it swayed and bounced when she walked; she was so looking forward to flirting with them and seducing them into doing whatever she wanted. She would be the older woman, so having a bunch of &quot;Little Boys&#39;&#39; trying to please her was definitely something she&#39;d enjoy.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for her, she was so distracted by these thoughts that she was paying no attention to what she was writing on the scroll. Had she been, she would have seen that she unknowingly wrote a &quot;D&quot; instead of an &quot;M&quot;. But before she even had a chance to notice her mistake, Aya marked a period at the end of the text, activating the magic within the scroll. Ava watched in surprise as the scroll suddenly and very quickly rolled itself up, before it then lifted into the air and then vanished in a puff of white smoke.<br />
<br />
Aya almost immediately felt it on her flesh, an intense heatwave that made her moan. She cried, undressing, knowing that something was terribly wrong as her nipples hardened and she felt an alien throbbing in her shaved crotch. She looked down between her legs to see her clit pushing out; growing thick and stiff and taking on a more phallic shape. That was not all; her pussy quickly sealed itself, leaving behind a smooth area of skin that soon bulged outward with the appearance of two little marble-sized balls that were steadily growing bigger and rounder inside an expanding ball sack. It was then that an itching sensation spread across her smooth skin as body hair began to sprout without regard to her femininity.<br />
<br />
Crying and naked, Aya ran from her room to the bathroom to see herself in the mirror, to see the horror that she had caused to her body. &quot;Noooo!...&quot; She sobbed in between moans from the pleasure rolling through her body &quot;Please... oohhh... mmmm ...no! This... mmph... is... isn’t… uhn... what... I... uhn… I... wanted...uhnhhhaah!&quot;.<br />
<br />
The expanding flesh on her crotch had grown into a large erect penis that hung heavy between her legs; her breasts swelling, not into the boobs she wanted, but into hairy pecs. Her beautiful brown hair pulled itself back into her head as her face swelled up, becoming way shorter and grayish. Her flat, smooth, tummy swelling out into a round yet muscular looking gut.<br />
<br />
Aya watched as her beautiful face changed in the mirror, her facial structure morphing taller and more rectangular. Her cheekbones grew sharper while her jaw and brow took on a broader appearance. In addition to this, creases were starting to appear, especially around her eyes and forehead as her face aged before her eyes.<br />
<br />
Aya grabbed a hold of the bathroom sink and grunted as her back expanded wider, while her voice grew deeper and her tiny feeble form was replaced by manly muscles. Her hands grew bigger, her fingers growing thicker and longer, and her arms swelling with muscle. Aya could feel her feet stretching across the cold floor as they grew in size, while her legs and thighs gained in mass and strength from the muscles growing there. Meanwhile, the soft cheeks of her cute little ass swelled into a round yet muscular manly-looking butt.<br />
<br />
If someone were to walk past the bathroom at that time, they would have heard the sounds of the transforming girl as her sensual moans gradually changed into deeper sounding groans and grunts. While the changes wracking to Aya’s body disgusted and frightened her, it did not stop the fact the sensations wrought by them felt sensual and erotic, and poor Aya was forced to ride the assaulting waves of sexual pleasure.<br />
<br />
Subconsciously pushed and cornered inside her own brain, Aya whined about how unfair it was that such a simple mistake, putting a &quot;D&quot; instead of an &quot;M&quot;, could lead to such a drastic transformation.  “Why?!” She cried, “If only those bitches had been nice to me! I only wanted to be desired like them!!”<br />
<br />
Soon the pleasure she was feeling began affecting her mind as Her thoughts were replaced terrifically quickly by things that she never even considered, that she didn&#39;t like, that she hated, but not the man... the man that she was becoming. Thoughts of seducing her former sorority sisters, making them beg for her dick To suck it, to be fucked by it. Thoughts of gripping their big breasts and round ass cheeks in her hairy hands, kneading and squeezing them while she had her way with them, filling their pussies full with her cock. Them moaning her name as they came upon her dick… calling her “Daddy”.<br />
<br />
The pleasurable pulsing and swelling sensations of her muscles growing along the throbbing of her large cock finally pushed Aya over the edge. With a very loud grunt, her big balls tensed and she blew a massive load of spunk onto the sink in front of her and onto the floor below. Aya was no more; the man was all that was left.<br />
<br />
A little while later, &quot;Dave&quot; came out of the house wearing the clothes he found around the sorority house; a pair of jeans and a white shirt that he hadn&#39;t bothered to button up, proudly displaying his hairy chest and stomach.<br />
<br />
Dave was quite satisfied with himself. There was a new daddy on campus... and he was going to run wild.</p>
