<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked at the young girl in front of her and smiled. &quot;You know I&#39;m not really sure,&quot; she said. &quot;Kellie.....I mean Katie won&#39;t be home from school for awhile. We have the whole day to  ourselves.&quot; Grace gave Katie a curious look. &quot;Your not telling me something,&quot; she said suspiciously. Katie cursed herself silently, she had accidentally used her mothers name instead of her own. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean Grace,&quot; she lied. <br />
<br />
Grace continued to give Katie a suspicious look as she sat down in a chair. The young girl giggled as she realized her bare feet no longer touched the ground. Swaying her feet Grace now stared directly into Katie&#39;s eyes. &quot;I know your not telling me something,&quot; she said. &quot;I may look like a kid but I have the 85 years of experience in dealing with people. I can tell when someone is holding something back, just like you are now. So do you want to tell me or should I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the young girl in shock. Although she was only a child she found herself intimidated by the maturity Grace still carried. She had after all only physically regressed her, Grace still maintained all the experience, wisdom and experience of a woman of 85. &quot;Okay,&quot; Katie sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace smiled warmly as placed her arms on the table and propped her head on her hands, even though the sleeves still covered her hands. &quot;Okay,&quot; Grace said. &quot;Let me guess first then you can tell me the rest. Your not Carol, Kellie&#39;s sister are you?&quot; Katie shook her head no. &quot;And that little girl that went to school this morning...that wasn&#39;t Katie either. Was it?&quot; Once again Katie shook her head no. &quot;No,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I&#39;m Katie. The girl you saw this morning was my mom Kellie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie now told her tale as Grace listened intently. Katie told her everything. How she had found the ring, her initial experiments in changing their ages and how Kellie had accidentally become aware of the changes. Katie told Grace how she had continued to change their ages and that her mom had deduced their was magic involved but didn&#39;t know Katie was involved. Finally she told Grace about meeting Merlin and how the ring compelled her to make people younger and older. For her part Grace listened intently as she continued to sway her bare feet. The story was incredible to her and as Katie completed her tale Grace smiled. &quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve had quite the adventure,&quot; she stated. &quot;I can understand not wanting to tell your mother, she may not be as understanding as I am. Then again I don&#39;t think she really wanted to be a child again either.&quot; &quot;What about you,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Do you want to be a child again.&quot; Grace smiled and shrugged her shoulders. &quot;I guess maybe a little,&quot; Katie and Grace now looked at each other in silence. &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
Grace tilted her head slightly and gave Katie a thoughtful look. &quot;Well I&#39;m not sure I can trust you just yet,&quot; Grace said thoughtful. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, you seem like a nice girl but how do I know your Katie. I&#39;ve known Katie, the seven year old Katie, since she moved next door to me five years ago. You do look like her a little but how do I know your not just some crazy witch running around town making people younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked down at the ring on her hand and knew what she had to do. &quot;What if I made myself seven again,&quot; she answered flatly. &quot;If you saw me at seven would you believe me then?&quot; Grace nodded her head enthusiastically as Katie sighed. While she did enjoy being an adult maybe becoming seven again would allow her to have fun with the child Grace, plus it would give the two of them a chance to bond. &quot;Okay I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she stated as she wished to become seven again.<br />
<br />
Katie felt the tingle slowly spread through her body as she began ageing backwards. Slowly her clothes were becoming looser as she looked at Grace trying to gauge if her regression was visible yet. Grace stared wide eyed as the mature woman in front of her slowly began to grow younger. Within moments Katie was 19 again. &quot;Oh wow it&#39;s working!&#39; she exclaimed. &quot;You look like a teenager again. How do you feel?&quot; Katie shrugged and smiled as she became 18. &quot;Okay I guess. I&#39;ve spent the last few days becoming older becoming younger feels really weird...like I&#39;m being tickled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace watched wide eyed as Katie journeyed through high school in reverse becoming a junior, then a sophomore and then a freshman. The 15 year old girl was beginning to shrink right in front of Grace, her features became delicate as her curves slowly melted away and her breasts began to deflate. Soon a coltish 14 year old was looking at the seven year old in front of her. &quot;So do you believe me now?&#39; Katie said in a youthful tone. Grace nodded her enthusiastically. &quot;Yeah now your starting to look like the Katie I know. You can&#39;t be more than 14...wait now 13.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie unconsciously grabbed her dwindling breasts. Where before they were impressive c cups they had been reduced to a pair of small mounds that were rapidly shrinking back into her chest. Feelings of doubt clouded her mind as she reached the awkward stage of 12 where girls begin to worry about their bodies. Those feelings soon passed as Katie became 11 wiping out most of her womanly attributes. &quot;Now I see why you keep making people younger,&quot; Grace exclaimed. &quot;Watching someone get younger is so...so...cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled sheepishly and blushed slightly as she became 10. Her shoes choose that moment to fall off small feet with a loud clunk. Looking down Katie could see that her feet were still covered in overly large socks and that her feet just barely touched the ground now. As Katie entered the single digits her feet left the floor and began to sway slightly causing the socks to flap noiselessly. Katie giggled as she kicked her feet rapidly causing the socks to fly of exposing her freshly painted toenails from yesterday. The two young girls now giggled as Katie continued to regress becoming eight and finally seven. When Katie was done she looked at Grace and smiled. &quot;So you believe me now,&quot; she squeaked. &quot;Wow Katie it really is you,&quot; Grace exclaimed. &quot;I guess we have the rest of the day to play. Come on lets go upstairs I think I have some old dolls you might like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled happily as she hopped off her chair causing her pants to cascade down her skinny legs. Her overly large shirt, like Grace&#39;s, now covered her down to her knees. &quot;That sounds like fun Grace,&quot; she said. &quot;We can play for awhile and then maybe become older later in the day.&quot; Grace looked at Katie as the two girls padded out of the kitchen. &quot;I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship,&quot; she said as she placed her arm on the girls shoulder.</p>
