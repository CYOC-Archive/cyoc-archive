<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott decided to tell Doug about the origins of scraps his slave.<br />
Scraps originally was Scott’s 3rd grade teacher, Mr Hammond.<br />
Scott assumed that Mr. Hammond had been gay, but that closeted would be the best description. <br />
“Well” said Doug, “'scraps' is not that now!”<br />
Scott told Doug that his dad found out that Mr. Hammond was gay and had seen him looking at man porn and visiting gay bars undercover and decided to break him for Scott to use, this solved several problems, Scott being big for his age and a confirmed smoker, it was “awkward” at school which was a seriously “non smoking area” so with a tutor of his own he would need to go to school and a broken tutor could be used by Scott to encourage his dominant tendencies.<br />
“Wow” said Doug; “your father did that for you aged 8 or 10.”<br />
“Well the picture had him at age 10 with me, but I agree, my dad did it first, and then presented him to me to 'practice' on” said Scott.<br />
Doug replied, “He did a great job of it too and what about the other two slaves I saw in the picture of you age 16 they were both your age.” <br />
“Perhaps they were two jocks that chose the wrong kid to pick on in freshman year.” <br />
“I had assumed they were slaves too.”<br />
“They certainly are now!”<br />
“They were collared then too?” <br />
“Well! After my dad found out they had been picking on me for my rather eccentric ways. He decided I should grab two new ones to learn the Art on.”  <br />
“I see you have remembered your life before the program now.”<br />
“Yes, I think it is separate, although I can access it, but it's not exactly me. you know? It’s like I know it like a memorized book, but the persona driving it isn't me. I'm still the innocent guy you met, and now just dealing with the body you gave me.” <br />
“But you have overlaps because you are smoking heavily now!” <br />
“You should know that there is a dichotomy between me and the &quot;rest of world version of me&quot; and I've got to deal with that. Perhaps you can walk me through as you sort of BOOST my smoking equipment?” <br />
“Well Scott, the pipe you are smoking is a large Boswell.”<br />
“I had been smoking a cigar?” <br />
“You filled the pipe yourself and it came naturally, you filled it slowly with small pinches of tobacco that you tamped down as you finished your large ring gauge cigar.”<br />
“Oh? When did this happen.” <br />
“As we have been chatting, you did it automatically even though you expect your pipes and cigars to be ready for you as is your right as the Dom man you now are.”<br />
“A large Boswell is now my 'everyday' pipe.”<br />
“By the way, Scott, I love my new hair!”<br />
“I hoped you would.” <br />
Yes, you need a large pipe, something like a Boswell Grizzly, to satisfy your needs. <br />
“Perhaps, but I get freaked out by it, after all I do it absent mindedly.”<br />
Doug looks in the mirror and says, “I know what you mean, I feel strange without my ink and being smaller, good but different” <br />
“Oh! How so?” <br />
“I look like myself but not myself if you see what I mean.”<br />
“Well tell me what you think. I'm curious.” <br />
“I had grown used to my tats, I didn't &quot;see&quot; them any more as they were just &quot;there&quot;, now that they aren't I miss them, rather like an itch that you can't get to scratch.”<br />
“Well new ones will take their place.” <br />
“I am happy being &quot;blank&quot; for a while and I am still getting used to my hair and beard,  the aerodynamics of my new hair make it obvious to me now and just getting used to it.”<br />
“Its fun isn't it? You've got no hair on the sides of your head. You've grown a MASSIVE Beard! And you're piercings are shiny and nearly new.”<br />
“My body feel shiny and nearly new too” <br />
“How do you see me? “<br />
“Far taller than I remember, perhaps because I am now shorter, you are tall, very well developed and with a confidence I didn't see before, your beard and moustache are beautifully tailored and you stand proud and erect. Awesome goatee at the moment and a fantastic handlebar, a full large heavy moustache, sticking out each side waxed to curl upwards at the ends.” <br />
“Given that I have just been altered,” said Doug continued, “I think I'd like to 'play' with you Scott'. We have the duplicated pizza-boy to practise on as well if needs be.” <br />
“Sounds good to me.” <br />
“Before that I will &quot;save&quot; the current Scott, so playtime will be just that fun, nothing permanent, but if something appeals we can incorporate it at a later date.” <br />
“Very good point.”  <br />
“I would like to turn you into a man mountain and mountain man at the same time, Scott, pushing 8ft and proportionately big, full and heavy beard, total body coverage in thick dark curly hair, muscled arms and legs, a huge beer belly, very masculine, a  broken nose, advanced MPB, waist over 7ft, aged about 45 to 48, some greying at the temples and in the beard, not too much, just a slight salting to give distinction to a rugged weather-beaten face .<br />
The salting is in the body hair too, which is speckled with white, you will be the sort of man that looks good naked and as good in red flannel combinations.<br />
You wouldn’t smoke a pipe; they would be too finicky for your large muscular and work worn hands. <br />
A “gar” man, plain and simple no frills,  LARGE stogies and plenty of them, your chest development means that you smoke at the same rate as an average man would smoke cigarettes. You are the type of guy that loves nose jets and that suits his look to a ‘t‘. LARGE, LARGE, LARGE stogies but not necessarily large ring size and you favour dark rich gars, large jeroboams? I think you may well have a cope habit too, as evidenced by the staining of your teeth and lower lip. <br />
You are a lumberjack shirt sort of guy. “<br />
“Wow,” said Scott, “I am to be not just well up on size there, but well packed at 8 feet in height, around 7 feet waist size.  I am to be a Cigar chomping, dipping, and super hairy 45-48 man?”<br />
“That sounds about right, any additions you feel would help?” <br />
“No Doug, it's all up to you.”<br />
“I think both Scott and Doug should be permanently stretchable so we don't need to worry about having to alter as the need arises. So, if you are ready and happy with what I suggest, you sit down and I will start the changes.”</p>
