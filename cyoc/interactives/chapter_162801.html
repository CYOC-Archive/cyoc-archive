<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jet has been a core member of the server and as such, Felix knows a lot about him.<br />
<br />
His story starts at his birth. He was the first-born but due to complications, his mother died during childbirth. His father didn&#39;t blame Jet but due to what happened, they didn&#39;t really form a connection like most son-father dynamics have.<br />
<br />
Jet&#39;s dad was gone most of the time. He works in an oil company as a head accountant or something. Which means they are somewhat well fended off financially.<br />
<br />
As for Jet, he learned to be independent at a young age. He was always left alone in their mansion. Even though they are rich, Jet&#39;s dad never bothered to hire maids. It was left to Jet to take care of the house as much as caring for himself.<br />
<br />
In school, Jet tried to join the swimming team. He excelled at first but got left out a few months later. His team got competitions state-wide but Jet&#39;s always benched. He got bored with it and left. It wasn&#39;t all too bad though as he got a swimmer&#39;s build that helped him transition to the soccer team. His dream of being recognized in sports was fulfilled with soccer. He and his team competed throughout the country for junior school leagues. And thanks to soccer, he met his first girlfriend - a cute brown-haired Asian girl with braces. Jet invited her to join the server but left later on. She always reprimanded Jet for sharing his face-pictures with the rest of the group. She may be bitchy but it seems Jet was happy with her.<br />
<br />
All was going fine until Jet&#39;s dad got promoted at his job. This required his father to move elsewhere, near the headquarters of the company he&#39;s working on. Everything Jet built up all over the years was gone in a single decision.<br />
<br />
He and his father screamed at each other for days. Jet vented in the vent channel all his frustrations at how self-centered his father is. He would rather move up his hollow job than let his son become happy. His father is just afraid of their home where Jet&#39;s mother lived and he&#39;s been trying all over the years to get rid of it. Jet wrote a novella&#39;s worth of moping in the vent channel and collapsed because of how much he has cried. We tried to keep his spirits up but his predicament is out of our hands.<br />
<br />
Before the summer break starts, they flew a few states over and settled in a green valley neighborhood. Jet sent a few pictures and we were amazed at how large his place is. It&#39;s like those MeTubers mansion neighborhoods they&#39;d usually flaunt in the trending tab.<br />
<br />
Jet, on the other hand, was up and down after moving. He&#39;d be happy at one time, but not too happy like when he used to share cursed memes and laugh at his own jokes. His girlfriend dumping him wasn&#39;t helpful either. His girlfriend was just being realistic. Nine out of ten long-distance relationships don&#39;t work out. They&#39;re young and they can still find love in other places.<br />
<br />
With a few months left before school starts and with no people that he knows in his place, Jet spent most of his days cooped up in their even larger mansion. He isn&#39;t moping all around the time though as we managed to urge him to continue the exercise regimen that he bragged so much in the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
And so, Felix decided that the first person to possess is Jet. He closed his eyes and focused on sending his will at the phone in his hands. He didn&#39;t need to focus much as in an instant, he felt his consciousness being ripped out of his body. It didn&#39;t feel painful, rather, it&#39;s quite the opposite. He can&#39;t put concrete words on it but his spirit felt free as if has breathed fresh air for the first time in years. The wind flew on the vestiges of his soul as he traveled in the expanse of the internet. He doesn&#39;t even know if he&#39;s on the internet but it feels like it does.<br />
<br />
As he was traveling, he was suddenly stopped by a mysterious force.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations on using BOYD. One letter away from BODY. Like you, who is one thought away from your dream body.&quot; the female voice from before said. &quot;Before proceeding, I will explain the mechanics of the thought transfer process.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix looked around the darkness and saw no one. He couldn&#39;t even see himself for he was formless.<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, your body. Thanks to a separate technology, your body will remain in stasis. It won&#39;t suffer any damage, suffocation, aging, disease, hunger, or even thirst. Not even a supernova from a star won&#39;t scratch your skin. Although, your clothes will burn and leave you naked. The body you leave will always be the body you&#39;ll return to - in case you want to return. To return, think of your original body with intense focus.<br />
<br />
As for the destination body. Any action you do in their body will be registered as their own. They won&#39;t know they are possessed unless you establish any form of communication and say that they are. You also won&#39;t be able to get their memories or skills, but the scientifically proven muscle memories will remain. <br />
<br />
As for what you can do, you can do anything within realms of imagination.<br />
<br />
Thank you for using BOYD - Body of your dreams&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And with that, Felix began moving once more at an accelerated pace. He was dashing through the darkness until he hit a barrier whose consistency felt like jelly. He sank through its surface and filled its every innard, crook, and cranny. He had a heartbeat once more. There&#39;s heat in his veins and it stretched throughout his limbs. On his back was a cool comfortable mattress. Atop his lap is a warm surface and when Felix opened his eyes, he realized it was a laptop with Jet&#39;s Biscord open.<br />
<br />
Felix raised his fingers and looked at it front and back. It surely is different from his pale fingers from before. Despite the darkness, he could see the calloused tanned hands brimming with grip strength Felix hasn&#39;t had before. He clenched his fist multiple times and admired how strong they are.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Felix realized. He jumped out of bed, nearly letting the laptop fall off the floor, and ran straight to the other room where the bathroom is. Felix thought of himself as already a fast runner in his precious body because of his long legs with longer strides. But running in his new body is a surprise. He reached the bathroom in a blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
In front of the mirror was a rare sight for eyes. It&#39;s Jet and the vision in front of him is no mere picture in the server anymore. It&#39;s the real deal. He touched his face and realized Jet has these light freckles on his cheeks. He didn&#39;t saw them before because of how faint they are. It&#39;s so cute.<br />
<br />
Jet has these blue eyes you can just get yourself lost it. It twinkled even in the light. Above his head is a tuft of uncombed brown hair that looked like a spoonful of a cloud. His individual hair is so smooth and you can barely register them between your fingers as you combed them over.<br />
<br />
The only downside being in Jet&#39;s body is how defeated he&#39;s looking. There are bags underneath his eyes and his limbs are weak like jelly. On the bed was a bag of chips that must have been his breakfast and lunch.<br />
<br />
Felix went outside his room and got himself lost in their huge mansion. He was lost for a while until he saw the kitchen across the courtyard of their huge garden. With the expansive space, Felix used this as a chance to test his speed. He set his sights for the door as he laid his knuckles on the ground and one of his foot way behind him.<br />
<br />
One.<br />
<br />
Two.<br />
<br />
Three.<br />
<br />
Go.<br />
<br />
And there he dashes as fast as the wind. It was heart pumping and sweat-inducing. Felix has never been more alive than this. Within seconds, he was inside the kitchen racing his breath.<br />
<br />
Good. Felix huffed.<br />
<br />
From what he knew, Jet is a great cook. He filled the food channel in the server with dishes he&#39;s made. But unlike Jet, Felix is a shitty cook. He&#39;s so bad that he always burns the simple fried egg he&#39;s cooking. Although, the only dish where Felix excels is Mac and Cheese. Which quite luckily, they have a ton in their huge pantry with a metal door like the ones you see in professional kitchens.<br />
<br />
After eating and cleaning after himself, it seems that the house is reserved only for Jet at the moment. His father is nowhere to be seen and by Jet&#39;s accounts, he can be gone for days at a time. There&#39;s a lot he can do with that spare time. So, what did Felix do?</p>
