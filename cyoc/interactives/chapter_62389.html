<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">MacClure went quietly with state officers that would be responsible for taking him to the state prison where he would be incarcerated. I found it slightly surprising given what Officer Jenkins and I had found out about him in the course of the investigation. But, I managed to shrug it off. It was the end to what had been another eventful chapter in what had been a very eventful life for me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll always have my support if William forces the kidnapping case to go to trial,&quot; I told Officer Jenkins as we began to leave the Kalispell courthouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, George,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied, &quot;I had guessed that you would do that... you seem to be fairly protective of those take close to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't really explain that,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;I suppose now, it's a refocused territorial instinct. Molly and I have Bandhavgarh, but we can't defend it the way a mundane tiger would defend its territory... so I'd guess that we've turned those protective instincts toward what we can use them for... BUT I was pretty protective of Molly before I became a tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;and nearly got myself in trouble, too... but I did it for Molly. She deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Officer Jenkins gave a soft smile, &quot;from the way you talk about her... it's pretty obvious that you love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is the one I love the most, right now,&quot; I gave a slight smile, &quot;she is everything to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As Megan has been to me since she was born,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied, &quot;I can understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
As we made it out of the courthouse and into the parking lot outside it we ran into Brent Marksman who was waiting beside our squad car with his brother. The brother was quiet, but Brent looked to both of us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said politely, and hugged his brother, &quot;thank you for all you've done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just doing our duty,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, thank you,&quot; Brent told us, and then focused on me, &quot;and Officer Wayne, thank you for sticking around... looking back on everything... even if he had won... Beauregard's scheme probably would have been discovered eventually... and MacClure's temper would have gotten the better of him... and without you, there would have been no justice for our Old Man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will always be justice,&quot; I told the teen, &quot;it may simply be a question of when it happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Things were quiet on the way back to Columbia Falls. We were permitted to take the rest of the day off, and Officer Jenkins actually dropped me off at Bandhavgarh Cabin before heading back to the station to switch to her own personal vehicle and then to drive to her home. As we pulled up to the cabin, we found that there seemed to be a little bit of excitement going on there, as Tabby's car was marked on long &quot;driveway&quot; in front of the cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems you have visitors, George,&quot; Officer Jenkins quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would seem so,&quot; I nodded as Officer Jenkins let me out, &quot;though I think the guests are here to see Molly. School should be out by know, and most of the people should be fairly aware of the fact that normally we pull fairly long hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully there is no bad news,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied, &quot;have a good night, George.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; I nodded and made my way in<br />
<br />
I made my way into the cabin to find Molly, Tabby, and Veronica all seated on the couch. They were engaged in some light small talk about the day's events, and Veronica was actually snacking on a packet of hard salami that Molly and I had bought As I entered I watched one of Molly's ears turn in my direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello to all,&quot; I said in a relatively cheerful voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, George,&quot; Molly responded while Tabby and Veronica also said their &quot;hellos&quot;, though Veronica's didn't quite sound &quot;correct&quot; as talking with one's mouth full never worked all that well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're home early, George,&quot; Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;MacClure's trial was completed,&quot; I gave a shrug, &quot;the jury found the evidence overwhelming and he was found guilty. So, Officer Jenkins and I were allowed to clock out early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you came to play?&quot; Veronica asked as she looked up from the snack that Molly had likely given her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came home,&quot; I replied, &quot;besides... I'm sure you wouldn't want to get caught playing with an &quot;icky boy&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Veronica, dear, why don't you go and color in their dinning room for a few moments,&quot; Tabby urged, &quot;mommy has some things to talk with Mr. and Mrs. Wayne about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George and Molly,&quot; Molly and I corrected. I then continued, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Wayne are my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabby gave a smile and looked to her daughter. Veronica nodded at the suggestion and carried her backpack into our living room. Once Veronica was there, the conversation grew more serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought you two would like to know this,&quot; Tabby began...<br />
<br />
&quot;Know what?&quot; Molly asked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember when you two suggested I should run for the School District's Superintendent's spot?&quot; Tabby asked and waited for Molly and I to nod. &quot;Well, I've talked with other members of the PTA, see what they thought of your idea... told them how the superintendent is sticking to Beauregard's R.A.M. measures...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did they say?&quot; I inquired curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many of them were shocked that someone would cling to that ideology so fanatically,&quot; Tabby answered, &quot;and they agreed that if firing Molly is his only concern... then he shouldn't be the Superintendent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's how Molly and I have felt on the subject,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you run, Tabby?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;You know that George and I would vote for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've thought it over... discussed it with the PTA...&quot; Tabby spoke, &quot;and yes. I've decided I will run...&quot;<br />
<br />
She was unable to continue as Molly pulled her into a firm hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Tabby,&quot; Molly told her, &quot;I'm sure you'll do a great job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't get to excited just yet,&quot; Tabby warned as Molly released her, &quot;Hireman may not be the nicest of people, but he does have experience in campaigning. It will take a lot of work to beat him... especially since the only issue that he might be unpopular right now on is the list of restrictions he's forced on Molly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need any help?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;I can help for a little while after I'm done with work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the PTA members I've talked to have already agreed to help with signs and slogans and whatnot,&quot; Tabby explained, &quot;I figured you two ought to know what the decision was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Molly and I will do anything we can to help,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Tabby nodded, &quot;and Dave has also offered what help he can... so now... I slip into the trenches to try see that our school district is back on track.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you'll have plenty of support behind you,&quot; Molly spoke in an encouraging voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Tabby nodded and then stood up, &quot;but, for moment not much can be done.It'll be a little while before I can go down to City Hall and put my name on the ballot for the position... and even if that window was open... for the moment, I have a little girl who will need to go home and get ready for dinner... unless you two plan to let her fill up on salami?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We probably would let her do that,&quot; Molly gave a chuckle and hugged Tabby again, &quot;mostly since we can't digest anything but meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabby nodded, and then with her message delivered, she collected her daughter and headed out. Molly and I did what we could to help, which included putting crayons back into their boxes and putting the boxes back in Veronica's backpack. The young girl then hugged both Molly and I before following her mother out. We then found that Veronica had left a crudely drawn crayon image of two vaguely cat-like orange and black shapes letting a girl swing in their arms between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;She left us something for our fridge,&quot; Molly mused and then glanced to me, &quot;remember those days? Drawing pictures as a kid? Having your folks put them on the fridge door?&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of her wording was a generalized statement, since the way Molly's parents had treated her had not been good, and she had probably lost any love she might have had for them at one time. In my opinion, they deserved it for essentially abandoning their daughter. I pushed that out of my mind and answered Molly's question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I drew a lot of car scenes,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;whole sheets of crudely drawn cars... some police... some fire department... I think I even managed something that looked like an ambulance once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think our cubs will draw when we have them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I shrugged as Molly placed a magnet to hold Veronica's picture on our fridge door, &quot;I'd prefer to wait until we have cubs before wondering what they'll draw...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The next winter can't come fast enough,&quot; Molly gave a half sigh.</p>
