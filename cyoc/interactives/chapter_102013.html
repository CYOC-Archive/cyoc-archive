In the Anderson house, Martha was busy scrambling around trying to get everything ready. Aside from themselves, the Twists plus Francis’ brother would be joining them, and Nate’s girlfriend, Kenya. And later the Lawsons and Alex would be joining them. Whether that be for actual dessert or not remained to be seen. <br />
<br />
William and Nate set up the dining room, moving furniture around to make room to accommodate the extra bodies. Eric was in the kitchen helping pull dishes in and out of the oven, and such. <br />
<br />
“I think that’s about everything. I can finish these after the football game… and this needs to cool…” Martha was talking to herself. Eric took the opportunity to excuse himself, and get dressed. <br />
<br />
His long, late-night conversation with Spencer went very well. They spent most of their time talking about their lives before they moved to Moon Lake. Eric’s was extremely boring compared to Spencer’s, since he wasn’t just normal, but quite the wallflower. Still was a wallflower by most standards. <br />
<br />
“Whoa, Eric watch where you’re going!” Nate said, coming down the hallway with several folding chairs. He had shifted to make moving things easier. He was currently the strongest were in the family. <br />
<br />
“Oh sorry.” Eric said, realizing he’d gotten caught up in his thoughts, AGAIN. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay. What were you thinking about anyway?” Nate asked, setting the chairs down. Nate wasn’t even the slightest bit surprised to hear Eric dreamily say Spencer. <br />
<br />
“Really head over heels for her aren’t ya?” Nate smiled. <br />
<br />
“I’d say so. But what about you and this Kenya? Things must be pretty serious if you’re bringing her home.” Eric commented. <br />
<br />
“Well, it’s complicated. But I think we’re going to be in this for the long run.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Wow, should I congratulate you?”<br />
<br />
“Might be a bit early to do that. We’re not getting hitched or anything.” Nate said, while secretly thinking, “but maybe someday”. <br />
<br />
He still wasn’t a hundred percent positive he wanted to marry Kenya, but Nate was happy knowing that the two would be together for the foreseeable future. He did love her. Commitments were just a bit new to him. And at least Kenya realized that. <br />
<br />
“You boys ready to go yet? It’s almost ten. We should go before all the parking spaces are taken!” William called up the staircase. <br />
<br />
“Be right down!” Eric said, hurrying into his room to change. Nate quickly brought the chairs into the living room, and then dashed back into his own room to shift back to his normal form, and put clothing on. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Julie, are you up?” Melissa Stovall asked, knocking on her daughter’s door. They would be going down to Martin’s brother’s place in Astoria, Oregon. It was close enough that the family of weremer could just swim there and back in an hour. <br />
<br />
“Ya, just packing my bag!” Julie said. <br />
<br />
“I’ll be downstairs with your father. Don’t take too long, I’d like to leave before the tide goes out!” Melissa said. <br />
<br />
High tide was the ideal time to depart. It was still fairly bizarre for a normal to see the family of three wearing swim wear in November, and wading into the freezing ocean. Low tide only made things more difficult. <br />
<br />
Downstairs, Martin was on the phone with his brother, telling him they were leaving for the coast in a few minutes. <br />
<br />
“…you sure?… Alright, thanks Rick.” Martin said, hanging up the phone. He slide it back into the waterproof pouch around his neck. <br />
<br />
“Anything wrong?” Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
“Not really. Collin’s just moping around the house because he’s got that broken leg and can’t play this year. Driving my brother a bit mad. Just called to complain, and ask when we were arriving.” Martin said. <br />
<br />
His nephew usually came up to play what he called “were-ball”. Which basically meant a bunch of weres playing sports in their furry, or in Collin’s case scaly, forms. It was the one day everyone threw caution to the wind, and just had a good time. But the kid broke his leg skateboarding, so that threw those plans out the window. <br />
<br />
“Julie’s finishing packing now. We should be there by noon.” Melissa said. <br />
<br />
“Listen, before we go down, I didn’t say anything to Rick about Julie’s… behavior. Or about us. And I’d rather he didn’t…”<br />
<br />
“Know you’re a lousy husband, and a terrible role model?” Melissa said bitterly. Martin hung his head. He was under the impression Melissa was slowly starting to forgive him. But her words just went straight through his still wounded heart. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I won’t say a word to anyone. I’d rather your family not know about our personal problems either.” Melissa said. <br />
<br />
Martin thanked her, before going outside to warm up the car. And to check his email again. <br />
<br />
Ever since he’d gotten that email from Alyssa, a girl he’d had an affair with YEARS ago, he was quite paranoid. He’d sent an email back saying he wasn’t interested in seeing her again, and that he was too busy with work related things (she knew Martin was in government but that was it). <br />
<br />
Martin was so afraid she’d just show up on their doorstep, or call the house. He answered every call he could, and checked his email every chance he got. And this time, he found there was a reply, sent last night. <br />
<br />
“Seriously? You’re turning me down? Marty, has your life got you on a short leash again? I guess you really need some loosening up. I’ll be coming up to Moon Lake next week for a meeting with the mayor and his cabinet about contracting some repairs for the local college. And I’d really like to see you again. <br />
<br />
If you’re not comfortable with us getting intimate, we can just talk. Maybe over a coffee or something? Please? I really do miss you. You were my first after all.<br />
<br />
Just think it over. Alyssa.” <br />
<br />
A rapping on the car window sent Martin into a panic. Melissa and Julie both exchanged a look after seeing how spooked Martin had been. <br />
<br />
“Everything alright dear?” Melissa asked. Martin could only nod. He put his phone away, and tried to calm himself down. But he kept panicking over the thought of seeing Alyssa again. Whether he wanted to or not. <br />
<br />
What’s worse, some tiny part of his brain DID want to see this beautiful girl again. Martin had been the one who turned her into a mermaid. She’d been looking for a weremer to do it with, and found Martin through mutual friends. <br />
<br />
As if that wasn’t bad enough, Melissa was under the impression she was the only normal Martin turned. If she found out, Martin knew he might as well just start packing then and there.</p>
