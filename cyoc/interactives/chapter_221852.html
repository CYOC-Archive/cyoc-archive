<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In his apartment, David put the helmet down on his kitchen counter and went into his bedroom, looking at his motorcycle permit. “David Clark, you’ve almost done it - and now you’ve got a helmet. Life is pretty sweet.” He put the permit back and walked into his living room/kitchenette, feeling just a bit claustrophobic in his apartment.<br />
<br />
“I should air out the place - and maybe check on the bike.” He said, leaving the helmet unattended. He left his apartment. As he left, he closed his screen door, leaving the front door open, and walked out into the apartment’s courtyard, forgetting to lock to the screen door.<br />
<br />
Hearing the screen door of her neighbor’s apartment slam shut, Amy Banks walked out and saw David walk away. <br />
<br />
The two had a strange relationship - close, but not quite dating, David oblivious to his own feelings, Amy too frightened to really make a move. Amy constantly wondered whether she’d be enough for David; she wasn’t ugly by any stretch of the imagination, in fact quite cute, though her insecurities didn’t allow her to see that. Her big, green eyes were complimented by the cute round glasses she wore; she had a single piercing in her nose and curly brown hair that went down to her shoulders, covering her ears which contained quite a few more piercings. Today, she was wearing one of her usual outfits, a plain, baggy green sweater, a pair of gray jeans, and white canvas sneakers. She stood at 5’2, had extremely small breasts, another source of insecurity, a bit of baby fat on her stomach, relatively thin hips, and a not too impressive rear.<br />
<br />
She sighed, wondering if she was David’s type. They’d gotten close over the 6 or so months since she’d moved in, but it still felt to her as though they were in that awkward in between state, maybe closer than friends but not quite lovers. She and David were around the same age, their mid twenties, and both were still figuring themselves out.<br />
<br />
This closeness, however, meant that Amy had no issue walking into David’s apartment to wait for him. She threw her purse down next to her on the couch - it was an old canvas bag, well past its prime.<br />
<br />
Amy closed the screen door behind her and got into her now regular spot - the old, comfortable couch that had served David well for quite a few years. She sighed, looking around at the now familiar apartment, when she spotted the helmet on the counter.<br />
<br />
“Interesting… he must’ve got it for that bike he was working on. I bet it’d be funny to surprise him by wearing it when he walks in.” Amy thought to herself.<br />
<br />
She took her glasses off, set them down, and then picked up the helmet and put it on.<br />
<br />
Instantly, she felt a shock, like a current of electricity going through her brain into her body. Then, it died down, turning into a warmth, as if her entire body were getting a massage in a heated swimming pool.<br />
<br />
As the warmth spread through her body, Amy knew her body was changing too; body hair receded, never to be seen again. Her pudgy stomach pushed inward, becoming taut and fit. Her flat chest expanded into a pair of huge, round, fake looking E cup globes, topped with tiny areola but fat, long nipples; her hips widened, growing past her narrow shoulders a solid 6 inches on each side; her already large rear firmed up and pushed outwards, becoming pillowy and huge. Long, two inch nails appeared on her fingers, covered in green nail polish; her toenails became painted white, too, perfectly pedicured. Her arms and legs became more toned, her much silkier hair lengthened down to her new rear end, her face the final portion to change: her eyebrows thinned, her eyes became even bigger and more vibrant, blue eyeshadow appeared on her eyelids, her lashes lengthened, her lips puffed up and became covered in permanent red lipstick.<br />
<br />
New thoughts filled her head, ones she knew she hadn’t thought of before: sexual skills, positions, feelings of lust. David was, of course, at the top, but hot men filled her mind. Muscular, well hung men. And suddenly, women joined in. Women with huge tits, fat asses, well taken care of bodies. Some women with large cocks, too, either above their vaginas or in place of them. As the helmet did more of its magic, Amy’s love (and lust) towards David began to influence her new fantasies. As her thoughts turned towards positions of sex, David was always involved somehow, either having her suck David’s cock while jerking off another well hung man’s, sucking a man or woman off (or eating a woman’s pussy) while David fucked her from behind, having a threesome with another slutty babe and David… and then, thoughts of men and women transforming into new beings, just like her - including David. A hot, muscular woman with a fat cock above her vagina, ready to dominate Amy; a bimbofied whore, begging Amy to finger her until she came; a slutty Asian schoolgirl with extreme enhancements, making out with her - she knew, deep down, that they had been David.<br />
<br />
Amy’s clothes, which had melted away as she transformed, reappeared, this time much more suited to her body and personality. Her sweater returned cropped, exposing her well defined abs and stomach, and pushed forward by her new breasts. The grey denim pants became tighter and more form fitting, showing off her rear end. Her canvas shoes became canvas platform shoes, giving her a bit of height and allowing her to walk in a more attractive manner. Her glasses disappeared, no longer necessary for her to see clearly.<br />
<br />
Amy moaned out a sigh of relief as the warmth seemed to focus in only on her nipples and vagina. What had happened in about 30 seconds felt to her like hours.<br />
<br />
“Is it over?” She said aloud, a bit shocked at her sultry new voice. She pulled the helmet off of her head, revealing her new hair, and placed it on the counter where it had been. She walked into David’s bathroom and looked at herself.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God… I’m beautiful! No… even better, I’m a slut!” She said, giddily.<br />
<br />
She knew something in her had changed, but she felt so much better about everything.<br />
<br />
She looked through her purse, now a cuter more modern bag, and found her ID had changed. Somehow, she knew no one would find anything wrong with her but David.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait for David to get home…” she said, licking her new DSLs.<br />
<br />
About 10 minutes later, David walked back to his apartment. He’d tried starting up the bike to no avail. “Maybe I can tune the carburetor tomorrow. Oh well, no use worrying about it tonight. Can’t let that kill my good mood.” He said, walking into his living room. Suddenly, a pair of hands covered his eyes, and he felt… a pair of breasts push into his back?<br />
<br />
“Who’s there?” He said, a bit spooked.<br />
<br />
“I’m a little hurt you didn’t even think of me. Though I guess I wouldn’t, either, with the tits.” Amy said.<br />
<br />
David recognized it as Amy’s voice, but it felt a bit… different. Sultrier, sexier.<br />
<br />
“Amy? What’re you doing?” David said. Amy pulled her hands away.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to surprise you.” She said, going in front of David.<br />
<br />
David hardly recognized her. She was Amy, for sure, but… more sexually charged. Improved didn’t fit, as he’d liked Amy before, but he definitely felt more sexually attracted to her.<br />
<br />
And sexually attracted he was, as his erection tented his jeans.<br />
<br />
“A-Amy… what… how… I…” David stammered out.<br />
<br />
“Shhhh. Don’t worry so much, I’ll explain in a bit. For now, let’s take care of this.” She said, dropping to her knees and unzipping David’s pants.<br />
<br />
She pulled his underwear down to reveal her prize - David’s fully erect cock. David was relatively average, if not a bit small, at around 5 inches - despite this, Amy found it more attractive than any of the massive cocks she’d been shown in her former daze.<br />
<br />
Amy quickly got to work, lubing the cock up with her tongue before shoving it deep into her mouth. She sucked David’s cock like a pro, David moaning and feeling extreme pleasure. Suddenly, and without warning, David came, and Amy happily swallowed it all up.<br />
<br />
“Uh… I’m… I… I’m sorry, that was… ho boy, that was great.” David moaned out, collapsing on his couch.<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize. I’ve wanted to do that for so long.” Amy said.<br />
<br />
“Amy… where did you… what happened to you?” David said.<br />
<br />
“That helmet you brought home is more than just a helmet. I tried it on and poof, the new me was here.” Amy said, sitting next to him.<br />
<br />
“I’m… I’m sorry, I didn’t know it would-“ David started, but Amy cut him off with a finger to his lips.<br />
<br />
“You don’t need to apologize. I feel amazing, like I never have before. I love my new body, and my new thoughts. And before you ask, I’ve wanted to suck that cock of yours way before I put that helmet on. I love you, David, and I have for a long time. Whether you wanted my old body or only have eyes for the new one, I don’t care. I’m me, a new me, a me I’m proud to be, and if I had to do it over, I’d put the helmet on all over again. In fact, I might do that. There’s some settings on the side panel.” Amy said, handing the helmet to him. “Most of it was default, so I’m still mostly the old me, just enhanced. We’re lucky, I suppose, I could’ve been a completely different person that had no idea she changed - though again, I wouldn’t have minded that.”<br />
<br />
David popped open the side door looked at the settings menu. Every option was for women - or women with cocks. Sexuality was bi or lesbian. Cup size was D or above. Same with buttocks, being “large” or more. And he noticed an awareness setting - it was currently set to on. There were dozens of more options, let alone the custom features section. David couldn’t believe what he’d stumbled upon.<br />
<br />
“You should use it on somebody else. I’d love to have a threesome with you and another slut. And, if it’s okay, maybe I could help you? You know, find some more sluts. And I’d love to put the helmet on again, become whatever kind of slut you want. Maybe you could even try it on.” Amy said.<br />
<br />
“I… um…” David started.</p>
