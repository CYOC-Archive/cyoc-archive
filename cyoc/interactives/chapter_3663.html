<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bob had been so captivated by his physical and sensual change he completely forgot about his earlier call to Animal Control. The sensual lust now turned to fear. Bob had become a satyr like his son nodoubt had and even in his era other people would be offended by his new looks.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey Jon.... tell'em I changed my mind, Mary and I are keeping the goats as pets, called Bob from upstairs.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Minutes passed that felt like years as Bob hopped to hear the truck pull out and go away.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Bob, Bob, They say you need to sign a form, come on down and take care of this yourself, I'm going back home, yelled Jon rather disgusted.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bob stood at the top on the stairs pondering his situation. His mind was now captured by this new problem, yet he continued to nerviously stroke his hairy sheath.
<br />

<br />
Then from the back door came a call. &quot;Sir my I come in and have you sign this release form. The state rules are plain that such animals can be kept only under special circumstances, Sir?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bob grabbed his pants and a shirt from Todd's room as hw was two sizes larger than his Dad. Slipping them on he took a deep breath and marched downstairs.
<br />

<br />
Bob walked around the corner from the dinning room and suddenly stood face to face with the man from Animal Control.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes Sir, I need these forms signed! First, sign to give a liability release for having farm animals in a residential area, fine!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The man looked up and gave a friendly smile to Bob. &quot;I can see Sir why someone like yourself would be partial to keep goats, but the laws are strict. If you keep them they must have at least one acre for grazing, a clean water source, and of course waste removal. Oh please sign here that we did what you requested, then I can get time and a half for working late, fine! Again Sir thans for calling Pleasure Island Animal Control!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bob could hardly believe his goatish ears, not only did the man talk with him and see his satyrlike head but he was considerate. The fact that the county had licensed P.I.A.C. to handle animal control was unbelievable.
<br />
 
<br />
Now standing at his back door with a reciept in hand for the ownership of both Todd and Ann, who were in his garage humping away as goats.  Bob turned to see the clock, 5:30 his wife would be home from her cashier job by 9:20 tonight, what to do?
<br />

<br />
First I'll go visit Todd and Ann. &quot;I can show them we are a family again!&quot; So in one jump he landed his large clover hooves on the lawn. A quick dash to the garage side door he slowly opened and peered inside.
<br />

<br />
As expected Todd was in full glory humping away on Ann. &quot;Damn that kid he's been going on like this for three hours or more, thought Bob.&quot; He stepped in and the ory came to a quick halt.
<br />

<br />
Todd turned first to see who had enter. His mind was still functioning on a human thought pattern, even though he was becoming more goat minded as he humped away. Ann turned her gaze but kept her head down low, a sign of submission.
<br />

<br />
Todd knowing his father by sight and now by scent dismounted his conquest and pranced over to greet ole' Dad. A quick jump of his forelegs and he stood up straight, face to hairy face with Dad.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Scott I've joined you, I'm a satyr like you asked Madame' what's her name to change you! What happened Todd, you changed totally to a buck goat now was this what she planned? How did Ann become that pretty nanny anyway, asked Bob?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Todd shook his large head as if to say no way. Although he could member, think, and reason, he had lost the ability functionally talk.
<br />

<br />
Bob felt very warm on this Fall afternoon especially dressed in clothes and covered head to hoof in thick brown hair. Without a thought Bob peeled off the pants and then his shirt. Todd Baaaed' at his Dad at the sight of his most huge satyr maleness. 
<br />

<br />
Bob clomped over to Ann who by now was standing with head up and alert to what was happening. He stroked the smooth soft hairy back of his very goatish daughter. Cupping his hands he looked into her lovely square yellow pupils. &quot;Oh Ann even as a goat you have beauty, said Bob in a affectionate way.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ann raised her head and gave a friendly sniff of Bob's male parts.  Then he was amazed as she reached her head up and lick the end of his goat sheath.
<br />

<br />
Part of Bob was disgusted that his little girl would do such a thing. Yet the satyr form had it's basis in his personality now and he also felt a lusty need. As Ann continued to lick a large red knob poked out the end of the hairy sheath. Bob looked in horror and felt a personal delight all in the same thought.
<br />

<br />
The shaft of his goat cock began to seek the light of day as Ann licked at the expanding member. In minute Bob stood with a rock hard cock and his goat balss surging for a release. Ann the nanny goat sensed his need and lowered her head, spread her hind legs and offered Bob the door to his life ahead.</p>
