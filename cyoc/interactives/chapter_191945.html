<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seemingly unable to endure the silence and lacking the social graces to read the mood, Katie kept chattering happily about her husband to everyone and no one. She exploded in a fit of giggles when she described his cock and how much she wanted it, then in a conspiratorial and longing tone added that the muscular guards were larger by several inches. Her going into detail between the cocks&#39; individual differences and taste did nothing to ease her roommates&#39; doubts about their future.<br />
<br />
Justin curled further into his bed and threw the sheet over his head to muffle the sound. After that, blissfully, the words began to blur together for him as he finally drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
…<br />
____________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
“Wakey, wakey! Like, you can&#39;t sleep forever!” An exuberant voice gushed through the haze of Justin&#39;s mind and went POP! when it reached the surface. Justin buried himself deeper in his sheets, unwilling to follow the bubbly and cloying and happy command back to wakefulness. Five more minutes. “Umm, no wait, I&#39;m being silly again! You should totally wake up, but if you don&#39;t stay asleep we can&#39;t, like, start the lesson.” She wasn&#39;t making any sense, so Justin decided to stay asleep. That, at least, made sense.<br />
<br />
Somewhere distant he could hear a foot stamping and a series of petulant noises coming from... well, Justin didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
He did care however when the sheets were forcefully ripped from him and tossed into a corner of the room. Blinking, he tried to dispel the fuzziness and sheer amount of pink in still floating and unfocused vision. All those strange dreams about stuck in a Bimbo Academy had him wondering about what kind of drinks he and Zach had downed last night.<br />
<br />
Yet instead of Tom, who Justin had expected to pester him about waking up, a woman in her late teens bent over him. She tried to look angry and pouty. The softness and sheer cuteness of her features numbed the effect somewhat. He also realized that she was also the source of the earlier pinkness: Her entire skin was a shade of lavender pink. And a pair of nubs, like horns, were poking through her forehead. And tiny, flapping pair of bat-wings from the side of head parted her blonde hair. Justin&#39;s eyes drifted downwards, seeing the pair of nearly impossibly large breasts defying gravity with their perkiness. <br />
<br />
Then he noticed the slight rise of HIS slender chest. A few heavy heartbeats later, he felt his fingers pressing against something alien, wet, and hollow. Justin screamed. <br />
<br />
The woman recoiled, her hands pressing against her ears. “Like, I can totes hear you if you speak normally. Someone need to teach you Dream etiqu- eti- manners!” She continued to pout.<br />
<br />
“Why I am a woman!” Justin exclaimed as he continued to explore his body with mounting apprehension. Looking up, he saw a mirror on the far wall. He still recognized himself. Although his face and body were slightly androgynous and Justin knew he could pass for either a boyish girl or girlish boy depending on how he dressed. His sex and his breasts tipped that scale firmly to one side of the spectrum, however.<br />
<br />
“Now it&#39;s you being silly!” The pink-skinned bimbo clapped her hands together, clearly happy that she wasn&#39;t the one making a fool of herself this time. “But if my parents had given me a name like Justin, I&#39;d totally be confused too,” the earnestness of her admission and how she seemed genuinely sorry caught Justin off-guard as he wondered how air-headed this strange woman actually was. “Not that you need to worry your silly little head, since the Headmistress asked me to fix that.” <br />
<br />
Before Justin could protests, a lethargy enveloped his mind and body and he fell backwards and landed on a pile of soft pillows. He tried to struggle but realized that he had forgotten to move his limbs, or do anything except to breath. Slowly. In. And out. In. And out. His mind drifted again, moving slowly as if wading through honey. In. And out. Justin caught a brief sight of the bimbo, her eyes glowing, before his eyelids begun to feel heavy. In. And out. He should close them. In. And out. All he needed was his ears to listen. In. And out. The rest of his body didn&#39;t matter. In. And–<br />
<br />
The bimbo couldn&#39;t resist poking Justin&#39;s breasts to see if there were any reaction. She giggled, they were so small. “We&#39;re, like, gonna have so much fun together over the next three weeks. As much as I know you&#39;ll want too stay up all night and suck cock and lick pussy, please remember that sleep is very important to your health!” She paused, pressing a finger to her bee-stung lips and tilted her head as she tried to summon her thoughts. “In fact, I command you to try for six hours of sleep a day!” <br />
<br />
“Yeeesshh, Mistresssh!” Justin mumbled an affirmation, stumbling slightly on the words as he had forgotten to how to move his mouth but was still compelled to answer.<br />
<br />
“Good girl! Now we can spend lots of time together!” The bimbo demoness giggled again, beyond happy that the Headmistress had given so many new playmates. She was so nice helping these girls finding their true selves. Even if many insisted they were in fact boys. But that was why she was there to help them get rid of those silly ideas. “Totes need to fix your name first. Umm, usually Headmistress gives me one but since she hasn&#39;t I get to pick one. If I was lazy I would&#39;ve gone with Justin-e for your new name.”<br />
<br />
“Yeeesshh, Mistre–”<br />
<br />
“No, don&#39;t agree to that!” Justin repeated the phrase. The bimbo simply sighed, glad she caught it in time. Hypnosis was hard! “Like, I want to go all out for you. Not something boring... Hmm, could totes see you being a JINX! Like, no one would forget your name that way.”<br />
<br />
“Yeeesshh, Mistresssh!”<br />
<br />
“Though you should forget ever being called Justin. Having two names just makes things confusing.” Another affirmation. Such a sweetheart. Actually that made her think of something that had always annoyed her. “Like, if a boy calls me sugar one time, then sweetheart the next I have to first wonder if he means someone else, ya&#39; know. So, whenever someone says Justin, you&#39;ll hear Jinx instead.” Better that her little Jinxie didn&#39;t need to bother with having two names floating around in her head.<br />
<br />
“Yeeesshh, Mistresssh!”<br />
<br />
“All we needed to do today, so you can, like, wake up now.” <br />
<br />
…<br />
____________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
“About time you woke up.” It was Lisa speaking, looking more in control of herself than she had been last night. The goth was half-dressed and was hurriedly putting on a bra as Jinx groggily blinked away the last of his sleep. “Trust me, Jus-Jinx, you don&#39;t want to be late to your first class. The punishments they deal out here are harsh.” For a second it seemed the movement of her lips were at odds with his name, but Jinx brushed it aside. He had fallen asleep in his clothes and he felt them uncomfortably sticking to his body. “Your change is on the nightstand.” There was a guarded note in her voice as Jinx turned his attention to the brown package as if she knew what was in it. “Sorry.”<br />
<br />
Jinx immediately realized what she meant when opened it and saw another white tank top, but the briefs were replaced with a pair of pink panties and also included a padded training bra and 2-inch heels. He guessed he was supposed to wear this. Though it wasn&#39;t everything. He also found a phone and a chic-looking handbag inside. The handbag was purple unlike the rest and also had a signed note from the headmistress specially welcoming him to the Academy and the Full Bimbofication program. <br />
<br />
Any hope Jinx may have had that he could use the smartphone to call for help was dashed as Lisa explained that it was limited to the academy servers. There really was no escape and he hadn&#39;t even begun yet. She next directed him to the app containing his schedule and he a flashback to the ones he had in school. But the classes were... “Sexy Heel Strut for Sissies. Mistress Fantasia.” It only went down hill from there. <br />
<br />
“Since I&#39;m guess you haven&#39;t ever walked in heels before you&#39;ll want to pay attention to that one, trust me. Also make sure to fill in those free electives before tomorrow. You are lucky that whoever sent you here didn&#39;t fill them in for you.” Jinx could imagine the hatred Lisa felt for her parents as she finished up. Then she left Jinx alone in the cell as she went to her first class. Katie, apparently, had already having started her day. <br />
<br />
Leaving Jinx nothing to do except clean up and reluctantly dress. At least he&#39;d have time for breakfast before his first class.</p>
