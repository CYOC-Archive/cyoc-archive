<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heat. At the moment that was all that Jeff could sense around him as Sonya’s diaper. There was no light to be had since he was held securely in place by a onesie and covered with a blanket. But Sonya’s body heat he could definitely feel as she snoozed through the night. If he were capable of sweating in his current form who would be absolutely drenched right now. Hours would go by as dwelled on that thought when suddenly he was! A torrent of hot urine shot of Sonya into his awaiting padding as the diaper eagerly absorbed it up, his body swelling outwards in the process as the warm wetness spread throughout the diaper. Unfortunately some of his senses came flooding back such as smell and taste as the urine permeated his very being, and they were not pleasant! “Mandy! I’m going to freaking kill you! This is horrible!” Jeff screamed internally. Despite the obvious relief of letting such a large amount of pee out while she slept, Sonya didn’t even budge during this whole ordeal and slept through until morning - thanks mostly to the diaper - err - Jeff - doing it’s job of keeping her dry. <br />
<br />
More hours would go by, the warm ur one having since becoming cold and clammy, before Sonya began to stir and awake. First she rolled over and then got into a sitting position on her knees which twisted and stretched Jeff until her weight was put upon him once more as she sat on the back of her legs. A moment later, she pulled herself up by the crib bars and got into a standing position. Jeff was still snugly secured around her waist thanks to the onesie and still couldn’t see much though a little light to filter through now thanks to the absence of the blanket. It was at this point Sonya unleashed yet another torrent of urine into her already soaked and swelling diaper, causing him to expand outward even more so as it continued to absorb the offensive substance, Jeff now straining against the onesie that no longer felt snug but now tight and restricting. <br />
<br />
“How could this possibly get any worse?!” Jeff thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Not long after that badly timed thought, Jeff felt something poking into him and once the smell and sadly the taste registered be quickly realized what it was - Sonya was in the process of pooping! The offensive turd protruded out of her butt and into the awaiting diaper - but because it was already so tightly snug around her waist thanks to being completely logged with urine and held securely be the onesie the turd had nowhere to go as it smushed into the Jeff’s padding, the diaper attempting to absorb the less solid parts. Sonys didn’t even seem to sense what she was doing as there was no attempt to push and Jeff could hear no grunts coming from above him - instead she just let nature take its course before finishing off with a small toot. <br />
<br />
“Ugh! This is disgusting! Mandy! For fucks sake get me out of this!!!” Jeff screamed to himself. <br />
<br />
When Sonya’s mother Claire finally came into the room to greet Sonya good morning - Jeff was completely soaked and now had a poop to keep him company in this personal hell. When Claire picked up Sonya out of the crib and brought her to the changing table, Jeff could feel as he was moved with her across the room before Sonya was lowered down onto the table and her weight put back upon him. He felt as Claire undid the onesie and flipped back the flaps - light shined upon him now as he looked up at Claire who seemed totally unfazed by his current state - but he was just a diaper after all and did what a diaper was supposed to do. Claire reached down and ripped the tabs of his arms and legs open before folding him down and beginning the cleaning process. “I thought I smelled a stinky baby! Let’s get that dirty diaper changed out for a fwesh one!” Claire said to Sonya. He couldn’t see now with his body laying flat against the table but he could feel as Sonya’s bottom was lifted off of him and wipes were deposited into him. In A moment he was folding in half again and could see as Claire pulled him out for underneath her daughter and set him aside, grabbing a clean diaper and securing it to her. Once she was done she returned her attention to Jeff and rolled him up into a “ball” before taping his arms and legs around the dirty mass and moved him towards the diaper pail. He watched in horror as her foot below stepped on a pedal and the lid popped open before being casually let go.<br />
<br />
 Jeff landed with a *thud* and the sound of the crinkling plastic pail liner as he came to rest stop some other of Sonya’s used diapers. The lid shut above him as Claire moved away, leaving in a dark and smelly prison as nothing but a dirty baby diaper. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back at his house -<br />
<br />
Mandy woke up later than usual and sneak back into Jeff’s room and opened up his laptop with the Chronivac program still running. “I wonder how Jeffy faired the night as a Sonya’s diaper!?” She said to herself. She opened up Jeff the diaper’s profile and see the following prompt:<br />
<br />
Former Name: Jeff Davis<br />
Object: Pampers Baby Dry, Size 4. <br />
Location: Johnson Residence / Nursery / Diaper Pail<br />
User: Sonya Johnson / Girl / 18 months<br />
Status: Used. Wet. Dirty. <br />
Retrieve back to home location?: type YES / NO<br />
<br />
“Oh my god! He got the full treatment didn’t he?! And Sonya and Claire had no freaking idea!” Mandy gleefully said to herself. Still, she knew she couldn’t leave him there and needed to retrieve him… but she also wanted to have some fun with Jeff as well. Shocking the diaper she wore to bed was still dry meaning she didn’t actually need them. “Hmm, I’ll need to make a few changes to the program to make this work as I must have messed something up.” Mandy said to herself. Mandy set up going through the settings for a bit before returning her attention back to her brother the diaper. “Now what to do with you…” Mandy selected some options and the typed YES to retrieve him from their neighbors house. <br />
<br />
Back at the neighbors house…<br />
<br />
Jeff was trapped in the diaper pail as a dirty diaper which was somehow an even worse punishment than actually just being used as a diaper! Time really had no meaning in here as there was only darkness. No light. No sound.  But plenty of awful smells and the taste that he had to endure of Sonya’s little present. Suddenly the lid opened above him and light shone in as he got sight of Claire’s hand holding another used diaper! She released it and it came crashing down on top of him, with a loud *squelch!* it still felt warm and smelled strongly of urine, apparently only a wet diaper. The lid closed once again leaving him in darkness. Jeff began to think about what next to expect would Mandy actually rescue him or is he destined for the garbage dump? <br />
<br />
Just then there was a bright flash the engulfed his entire being - when jeff came to he quickly realized that he was back in his house and in his room more specifically. He still couldn’t move but he smelled… not like a dirty diaper at least. A Clean diaper, in fact. As Jeff took in his surroundings his sister Mandy appeared above him who now looked to be the size of a giantess! <br />
“Hello my beautiful diaper Jeffpers! I hope you had fun at the neighbors house! It looked like you got the full experience, eh? But I’ve decided I haven’t had enough fun with you yet!” Mandy then leaned over the laptop before hit a couple of keys and then looking back at Jeff as the transformation took place</p>
