<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Thanksgiving was associated a lot with feasting, parades, and the football season, it should still be remembered that it is the holiday of gratitude. It was the day where one expresses thankfulness for what one has.<br />
<br />
That was what Maggie Jones was reflecting on as she was sitting at the table that most of the people from her modeling school. She was aware that many of them were volunteers from Project Phoenix and had come to Animalia out of desperate need for the virus&#39;s healing properties. Maggie definitely was a case herself. Her life was nearly over after that flesh-eating bacteria nearly destroyed her body. But Project Phoenix allowed her to regain her looks. Being spliced with a leucistic American Mink gave her a remarkable resemblance to Minerva Mink, which had been her intention. Since then, she had been contributing to Animalia by helping those who wanted to use their newfound beauty in the glamorous and fast-paced world of modeling.<br />
<br />
Maggie watched as her students talked among themselves. Most of them were talking about their individual successes during the Bachelor/Bachelorette Auction and whether or not the ones who have won a date with them are keepers. Eventually, Maggie tapped her fork against her glass to get everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Ladies, gentlemen, I know you&#39;ve all been very successful and pleased with the Auction. While the total profit has yet to be counted, we know we&#39;ve been able to net at least 12 billion dollars.&quot; She allowed a few moments for the people at the table to applaud. She held up a hand to silence them before continuing, &quot;But let&#39;s not forget what we&#39;ve raised up all that money for. Most of that money is for charity, namely to help victims of Hurricane Harvey and the other hurricanes of this year in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. I&#39;m happy to say that not only will the money we&#39;ve made will allow them to rebuild, but we can also provide a lot of aid to third world countries.&quot; There was another round of applause at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And of course, the offers for modeling and advertising contracts have been tripled,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;But this brings me to the reason for my speech. We all have very good reasons to be feeling thankful today. But in the spirit of this holiday, I think we should telling each other what we&#39;re particularly thankful for.&quot; There was a bunch of nodding at that. &quot;I&#39;ll start us off,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;I am particularly thankful to be able to teach so many young people how to model. Working with you people has been a real treasure and I&#39;m very proud of what you&#39;ve all been able to accomplish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen the snow leopardess stood up next and said, &quot;I&#39;m very grateful to Project Phoenix who made this all possible. A bit more than a year ago, I was losing my hair to cancer and I myself might not have long to live. But Project Phoenix gave me a new lease on life, a chance to start over. And I know a lot of you have also come here for healing and it makes me even more thankful that Project Phoenix has been able to provide for all of you as well.&quot; There was quite a bit of applause at that before Karen sat down.<br />
<br />
Gwen the squirrel stood up and said, &quot;You know, as strange as it may sound, I&#39;m actually thankful to the people who ran the speakeasy that we&#39;ve found in our school.&quot; There were a few confused sounds at that. &quot;Let me explain. I realize that what they were doing back then was illegal, with the probation going on and all the gambling. But we&#39;ve been able to profit from what they&#39;ve squirreled away.&quot; There was quite a few laughs from that pun she made. Gwen just smiled and waited until they were finished before continuing, &quot;But our school has made a lot of profit from selling that gambling equipment and booze to museums and collectors. And it would have been possible if it weren&#39;t for the people who were playing under the table in those times. So I think we should show a bit of appreciation for that.&quot; There were a few murmurs of consideration as Gwen sat down.<br />
<br />
Zoe the lioness was up next. &quot;Like Maggie said, we netted a lot of money from the Bachelor/Bachelorette Auction,&quot; she said, &quot;But the benefit wasn&#39;t just for the people our charity is helping. We&#39;re also benefiting from this and it&#39;s not just because of how much business the school is getting. A lot of us have been looking for mates for a while and thanks to this auction, we&#39;ve all got a potential shot of meeting someone who&#39;s worth keeping.&quot; Zoe in particular had been trying to find a boyfriend. Technically, she was a bit young for that, having only turned 14 this year. But she was a double-dosed lioness and had the body (and needs) of an adult. &quot;And I&#39;m certainly thankful to be given a chance to date someone who might be interested enough to keep dating. And I hope the rest of you have similar luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Milly the mouse stood up next. She was even more controversial than Zoe. She was only a 3 year old toddler before an accidental second exposure to the Animalian virus gave her the body and mental capabilities of an adult. But Milly proved to be a prodigiously fast learner, both at adult basics and at modeling. It was becoming really easy to forget that she was a lot younger than she looked. &quot;I&#39;m particularly thankful in how Project Phoenix has led to me meeting my boyfriend.&quot; She smiled at Lenny the giant mouse. &quot;He came to Lyre so that his body stressed by gigantism could be stabilized and that&#39;s where we met each other. He&#39;s been a good boyfriend ever since.&quot; It was probably reluctance on Lenny&#39;s part to be marrying someone who was chronologically so young, but the two of them have just been going steady for the time being. &quot;And by extension, I think that means I&#39;m thankful that Project Phoenix gives us all the chance to find new people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary was a little out of place at the table, not just because she was a giraffe. She was attending the school to help her hone her acting skills. Not that she didn&#39;t have experience in acting, but there&#39;s a very big difference between acting as a dwarf and acting as a giraffe. Mainly, Mary was learning how to pose with more grace. Her speech reflected that. &quot;I&#39;m grateful that the Animalian School of Modeling is able to accommodate my needs,&quot; said Mary, &quot;I know that the most acting a lot of you will do will just be for advertisements, but I want to get into real show business. And this school has been so helpful in helping learn to use my new body more elegantly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sabine stood out from the others in a few ways. Not least because she was a spitting cobra sitting at a mammal-dominated table.  She was also one of the few people there who was an uplifted animal instead of a converted human. Additionally, she was completely unaffiliated with Project Phoenix, not even with her mate. &#39;Bazooka&#39; Joe became her mate when he, almost literally, won the jackpot on St. Patrick&#39;s Day. But that was part of what she was so grateful for. &quot;I&#39;m very thankful that I&#39;ve met such a wonderful man to be my mate,&quot; said Sabine, &quot;And I&#39;m particularly thankful for our children. It really changed my life when they hatched. Back when I was just a normal animals, I would have just left them and moved on. But now, I see why humans feel such a close bond with their children. I don&#39;t think I could be happier than with what I have right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The speeches went on as various students from the modeling school expressed what they were thankful for. Really, it was why Thanksgiving was such an important holiday. Not just for the food, but for families to come together again and express why they&#39;re grateful for the blessings they have.</p>
