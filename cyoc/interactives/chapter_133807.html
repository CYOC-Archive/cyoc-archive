<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having managed about five hours of sleep, Jessica and Monica were almost ready with the transport and subsequent vacation, six horses in the fixed trailer section, one of whom was Steve.  <br />
<br />
“You sure you’re dressed enough?”  Jessica couldn’t help but ask.  <br />
<br />
“At this time of night, it’ll be more than enough.”  Monica grinned back.  <br />
<br />
While Jessica had helped herself to a thick emerald-green overcoat that went to below her knees, along with a matching scarf that - with her hat - helped to hide her face and body.  Monica had only added a pair of dark-blue denim overalls to complement her gloves, which did nothing to hide her back and arms.  Indeed, her own massive breasts were pressing against the front hard, marks of the stress they were put under visible.  <br />
<br />
“In any case, are they secure?”  Monica moved the subject forwards.  <br />
<br />
“They are, we just need to go now.”  Jessica replied after seeing the thumbs-up from David, and at that signal, Monica hauled herself into the drivers seat, Jessica entering the cab moments later with Danni last in.  <br />
<br />
David, Jessica noted, was the same horse she’d seen in the Lab from earlier in the day.  Chestnut Blonde-and-White fur with a white mane and fetlocks, his clothing being a pair of denim pants, and that was it.  Slowly they made their way out of the closed Zoo, their appearance apparently nothing unusual to at least the staff since they waved them through without question.  Not too long after they were out of the City limits and on empty open road.  <br />
<br />
The subsequent first hour went by quietly, but soon enough the lonely road left Jessica bored, a loud yawn escaping her as she stretched herself as best she could given that she was between Monica and David.  It was doing this, that stretched her overcoat past its limits, and an audible ‘Pop’ and ‘Ping’ signalled a pair of buttons blowing off, bouncing off the windscreen and putting her own breasts partially into view.  <br />
<br />
“Oops.”  Jessica couldn’t help but giggle, the others joining in once the initial surprise faded.  It was now that Jessica decided to clear a matter that had been on her mind for a while now.  “By the way.  Samson said something about a workaround.  What did he mean by that?”  <br />
<br />
“He didn’t tell you?”  Monica queried, pausing reaching for something as a result.  <br />
<br />
“He said you’d fill me in.”  Not exactly what Samson had said, but close enough.  <br />
<br />
“I see.  Well, it’d be easier if I show you.”  Monica had in her hand a small vial, opened as she chugged down its contents.  <br />
<br />
“And what was that?”  Jessica couldn’t help but ask.  <br />
<br />
“You’ll find out soon enough.”  David cut in, having had the same stuff, a spare vial offered to her.  “Wanna try it?  Don’t worry, it’s perfectly safe.”  <br />
<br />
“Maybe later.”  Jessica decided, pocketing the vial and shutting her eyes to try and get some rest, not seeming to get her answer from Monica just yet.  <br />
<br />
Another hour passed, and Jessica’s efforts rest were coming to nothing, the heavy breathing, squirming, grunting, and occasional snort from Monica and David grating on her.  Constantly digging under her skin in a way that made it crawl, and making focusing on anything else an impossibility.  <br />
<br />
Finally, she was ready to just yell at them to quiet down when a raucous tear stuck her top-mounted ears.  Snapping her eyes open, the source of that shredding noise was found to be David’s pants, that had split open from the crotch to the top of his buttocks, putting them, and his massive mottled cock in view.  And massive it was!  <br />
<br />
Thick and swollen, even not fully hardened, it could still climb up to the tip of his ribcage.  Speaking of, that too, was far larger than she knew for certain it had been not long before.  A relieved snort telling her that David must’ve been waiting for that to happen.  <br />
<br />
“Ahh, back to my old self again…”  Monica sighed, arcing her back enough to force her overalls open, almost cracking the windscreen with her act.  <br />
<br />
And with it open at the front, it was clear to Jessica that not only was her chest barrelling out as well, but her breasts were sliding down her torso, making their way to her legs she was sure.  <br />
<br />
“Old?  Self?”  Jessica blurted out.  Just what had Monica meant by that?  <br />
<br />
“Ah, whoops.”  Monica chuckled, a hand reaching to her mouth that was looking decidedly distorted under the glove.  “It, means exactly what I said.”  <br />
<br />
“And that is?”  <br />
<br />
“Well.  How about you take that serum, and I’ll fill you in?”  Monica offered.  “But don’t you worry, you need two to go all the way.  Just that one will take away the hands and widen your frame, but you won’t get much taller, and can stay standing on two legs.”  <br />
<br />
“Why’d you even take that!?”  Jessica was more than a little alarmed at this point, after all, Monica was the one driving.  “And why wear something if you’re just gonna shred it?”  <br />
<br />
“It’s fun!  Both of these.”  Monica laughed, not caring that she’d opened new rips in her clothes and lost a glove when she bounced in her seat.  “Besides, I’ve done this enough times to know how to do it right.”  <br />
<br />
“So?  Are you gonna take it?”  David stepped in, his legs slowly sliding over the sides of his own seat.</p>
