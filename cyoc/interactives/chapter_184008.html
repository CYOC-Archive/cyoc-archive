<br />
Unbeknownst to her, she had been going at it deep into the night pleasuring herself and so come morning Amber did not only not wake up on time, she also muted her alarm clock out of reflex and went right back to sleep.<br />
<br />
Only a little after 10am, two and a half hours after she was supposed to be at work, did cracks of sunlight pierce through her blinds and began the process of waking her the natural way. Via liberal application of light to her eyelids.<br />
<br />
It took her not long after that to show the first signs of wakefulness, a twitch of the leg or her head rolling from side to side, trying to escape the blinding sun peeking into her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Soon, a low groan was heard, stirring memories of many hangovers in her college days as she finally cracked one eye open, only to violently flinch, clench it shut again immediately and roll to the side, face-planting into her pile of coins that she spent the night on and served as her bed.<br />
<br />
Fumbling around with her arms, startled, she didn’t really accomplish much other than spreading her gold hoard around, scattering a few coins under her ‘bedside’-table and into the hallway through her still cracked open door. After a few frantic seconds she calmed somewhat and pushed her body of the ground, her arms finding a stable position to push from despite the coins in the way.<br />
<br />
With her face free Amber attempted to get her bearings, blearily opening her eyes out of sequence as if that was going to help any.<br />
<br />
What had she done yesterday? Where was she?<br />
<br />
And most importantly, what was she feeling in her ass?!?<br />
<br />
That question finally did it for her as her memories got jump started and she remembered the preceding day, how her arms felt sore just holding her torso up of the ground, her breasts felt weird and she had her own prehensile dick up her butt.<br />
<br />
Then and there she also admitted to herself that she may have went a bit overboard with the changes. She had had the app for not even a full day and already she was some kind of dragon-girl with a dick and four pussy-breasts.<br />
<br />
She went to rub her blurry eyes but at the last second recalled just where her hands had been the day before and took a look at her right one she had lifted of the ground. It was still stained with her juices and thoroughly disgusting. Shuddering at what she had almost gotten in her eyes she decided to first of all get clean so that she could look at herself in the mirror without revulsion.<br />
<br />
The app would probably the easiest way to tidy herself up she thought, but as she looked to the side where she vaguely remembered having left the phone she discovered that it was dark. Having a small panic attack she scrambled onto her carpet proper and tried to turn her phone on, a few gold pieces came with her, having been stuck onto her by natures grossest glue.<br />
<br />
After making sure that her phone still worked and it only needed to be charged again after being left on the whole night and most of yesterday, she plugged it into her charger and resolved to clean herself the old-fashioned way instead of waiting for the app to be able to function.<br />
<br />
As she walked into her adjacent bathroom she peeled the few coins off of her skin while thinking about how she would even clean herself without triggering a pleasure cascade like she faintly recalled happening after she only tried to examine herself before.<br />
<br />
But as Amber saw herself in the mirror for the first time she discovered that that shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br />
<br />
The memories which she had acquired after using the app on herself seemed to not have integrated properly before, maybe because the change had been too recent for it to work fully and needed more time, that’s what she thought anyway. That’s the only explanation she had for not really being that aroused after seeing herself.<br />
<br />
Don’t get her wrong, she was hot, and now even more so. Her tail swaying languidly behind her. Her multiple breasts had her pussies on full display and the way her cock encircled her balls and went straight up into her body, even showing a bit in her belly, was incredibly enticing.<br />
<br />
But it was not getting her hard. Certainly if she tried to, she could, but then that would be just like masturbating with normal genitals.<br />
<br />
At least one problem solved then.<br />
<br />
The next 25 minutes consisted of her removing all the dried sexual juices from and inside her.<br />
<br />
Getting her dick out of her ass had been an ordeal, involving holding her breath over the toilet and taking what felt like the biggest shit in her life while wiggling her penis, but all in all it was a boring and disgusting half hour.<br />
<br />
Looking at herself in the mirror without being grossed out was a huge relief, and for fun she even waved at her reflection with her cock-tip.<br />
<br />
She felt great!<br />
<br />
“Ok so I’m awake, clean and only have to wait for the phone to charge to… oh shit! I have work today!”<br />
<br />
She raced out of her bathroom to her phone, on the way nearly hitting her floor lamp with her tail. Amber hoped her phone had recharged enough to be used, which it fortunately had. She noticed a new message and a few missed calls. Opening the message before she tried to fiddle with the app to get out of work, she relaxed. Her boss had sent it to Amber to inform her that the office had been flooded by a burst pipe. Nothing serious had been damaged and the insurance was going to cover it but the location would still be out of commission for a few days while the damage got repaired.<br />
<br />
As her boss couldn’t get a hold of her she tasked another secretary with informing the patients of what had happened and rescheduling appointments.<br />
<br />
Adrenaline fading as fast as it arrived she slumped onto her still spread thin pile of golden treasure and only then remembered that it too had been made sticky with all her self-love.<br />
<br />
Sighing she opened the app even though it wouldn&#39;t be necessary for her job. Now she had to get clean again, using it even though she did it all by herself already.<br />
<br />
“Amber is lying on her filthy dragon hoard.”<br />
<br />
Well that was easy.<br />
<br />
She changed ‘filthy’ to ‘shiny’ and all at once her once cum-matted hoard of gold coins became beautiful and magnificent once more and she along with it, again.<br />
<br />
Having resolved her hygiene emergency she checked the phones charge, seeing that it was at 33% and enough to disconnect it from the charger. She wanted her next change to be in front of her bathroom mirror after all, that should make picking what to change easier.<br />
<br />
Walking into the bathroom again Amber began thinking about what she could change to make her life easier. Mental changes didn’t seem necessary. The memories of her new life that asserted themselves since yesterday were doing a good job of curbing her urges to fondle herself so maybe more physical changes were in order. This time to minimize her potential to start another bout of uncontrolled masturbation she should probably not try anything too sexy.<br />
<br />
Standing before her mirror self and consulting her new memories she tried to find something that had annoyed her pre-app self about her body.<br />
<br />
One thing immediately came mind, her breast-pussies. They were the ‘strangest’ thing about her new body and she apparently had always had them since she was born so she was quite used to it by now. Nonetheless, as she was growing up they had remained a nuisance, they were very obvious, in that they took up most of the real estate of her breasts and stuck out even when she was wearing a bra. Not to mention that four vaginas rubbing against material that wasn&#39;t designed for it chafed and in one instance aroused her, to the embarrassment of her parents at the pool.<br />
<br />
Blushing at the memory that hadn’t been hers until recently she resolved to try to do something about them, maybe she would get an idea when she had a sentence in front of her.<br />
<br />
“Amber is standing naked in front of her bathroom mirror.”<br />
<br />
Well that wasn’t very helpful at all!<br />
<br />
“Amber the dickgirl is thinking about her multiple breasts.”<br />
<br />
Close, but not what she wanted to change, she liked her four breasts as is.<br />
<br />
“Ambers dragon tail is twitching in agitation, flicking in and out of sight.”<br />
<br />
Of course it was, stupid app!<br />
<br />
“Amber is trying to change her exposed breast-pussies.”<br />
<br />
Finally something she could work with. Now how to fiddle with the sentence in the correct way?<br />
<br />
Tentatively she changed ‘exposed’ to ‘concealed’ and hoped it wouldn’t just simply make her wear clothes.<br />
<br />
As reality rippled and her mirror got foggy for a seconds she got startled by the change a bit, never having noticed the effect so prominently before as she was always occupied with something else to look at rather than her surroundings.<br />
<br />
Once she could look at herself in the mirror again she discovered that where there were previously four vaginas, there was now nothing but blank breast flesh, four globes with nothing on the front.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly grabbing at one of her breast she hoped her pussies hadn&#39;t fully disappeared. To her delight, they hadn’t, they were simply much more hidden now. Where before her pussies had been exposed to the air, for all the world to see, they now resided in a skin flap nearly totally invisible when one wasn’t looking or feeling her breasts up.<br />
<br />
Trying to look inside her new pussy-flaps using the mirror, she saw that inside they looked the same as before but as soon as she let the new flesh hiding her vaginas go, it seemed to seal up and become just one expanse of breast flesh, unadorned with anything.<br />
<br />
Marvelling at the change she soon got her memories of the new change as well. Curiously she hadn’t always had her fuck holes. They apparently came in with puberty. One day as she was gently rubbing her dragon cock and fondling her breasts while her parents weren’t home, her fingers slipped inside her mammaries. The shock of it brought her instantly to orgasm, as at that point in time she never had had any female orgasm to begin with, it overwhelmed her. Later the same newly discovered genitalia got her her acquaintance and eventual job with doctor Long’s office as she had been there quite a lot to examine her unusual anatomy.<br />
<br />
Quite happy with the change, as she could now effectively cover her strange vaginas without getting aroused or anything chafing, she thought about other changes she wanted to make, or was this enough for her to go out and maybe change something or someone else? She could even continue to change her apartment, the pile of gold coins was nice to sleep on and all but a dragons lair it was not.<br />
<br />
Or maybe… she could change herself in more devious ways again. The change to her pussies had felt quite exciting after all...</p>
