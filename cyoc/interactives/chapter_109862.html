<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer doubled over as her entire insides started to bulge and shift. A fire spread through her blood, and the heat enflamed into her brain. As her muscled tensed, she clenched her teeth, and she could feel her bones snapping, reshaping, rejoining. Her heart was pounding. Pain filled every molecule of her being. And she felt... hungry.<br />
<br />
Paula stepped back from her. &quot;Oh shit. Everybody clear back! Clear back!&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the teachers stepped out of a nearby room. &quot;What&#39;s going on! Miss Smith? Are you all...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s face projected outward with a large crunch, her skin stretching and reforming as she felt her teeth sharpened. Her nose&#39;s senses flared. She could smell the fear in the meat around her. So much meat....<br />
<br />
She could hear Paula screaming for everyone to run. It sounded faded, as if in a dream. All she felt was the pain. Putting her hands on the ground, she watched as her fingernails were punctured by long razor sharp claws that dug into the tiled floor, cracking each tile into shards. Her muscled back continued to expand outward, forcing her spine to stretch longer and bend. Her clothes snapped apart, but she barely noticed. The skin on her head tightened. As parts of her skull cracked during reshaping, her ears were pulled upwards, lengthening. Suddenly the sounds no longer seem faded. They were clearer than ever before.<br />
<br />
For a moment, she thought she was going to choke. Her throat tightened as it too reshaped. Her cries could not longer escape through her sobs. Instead, her vocal chores were suddenly wrenched around, as if someone twisted them with their hands. She no longer sounded like herself. She sounded like an animal.<br />
<br />
Warmth continued to cover her. It took her a moment to realize her body hair was coming in so much fuller now. Fur. A coat of gray fur. A small part of her humanity remarked how odd it was. She thought with her hair should would had reddish fur.<br />
<br />
Trying to stand, her feet no longer operated correctly. Her feet cramped, and she found herself standing on the balls, with her toes and forefront of the feet elongating outward. Her heels snapped upward so quickly, Jennifer thought she was going to fall over. She didn&#39;t. Instead her legs continued to reshape, with her ankles reforming into backwards facing knees of a sort. Only then did the pain start to subside. She was feeling whole again. She was feeling... right.<br />
<br />
Hunger.<br />
<br />
Looking around, she saw a large number of students and staff. Many were staring in horror at her. Others were wisely running like hell. All of them look delicious.<br />
<br />
Food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not them,&quot; her last dying human thoughts said. &quot;This is Kyle&#39;s fault. Not theirs. You should hunt him down... hunt... and eat him. Feed. Feed off of his body. Feed off of their flesh. So... hungry, and all this... prey.&quot; What was Jennifer was gone.<br />
<br />
Even after the creature jumped into the crowd and started devouring, most people injured or killed were caused by mobs of people trying to shove others aside or run over them. In the chaos, the beast had time to take down as many of the bipedal animals before anyone tried to take an offensive against her. She made it clear she was in charge. One of the prey tried to grab a hold of another stuck in the middle of the horde fleeing through the narrow halls. She bit into the arm of that one and pulled the one it was trying to escape away. Instinctually, she knew it was best to take down as many as possible, and only eat the fallen once things quieted down. It made the most sense. Enough would survive and beast and make new baby prey later. There was more than enough here for her. This was her world. They were just animals.<br />
<br />
It would be another twenty minutes before the police and animal control showed up. Some of the students were pleading with them, trying to explain what they saw inside, but police had reasonable people. It couldn&#39;t be a monster from an old movie or book in there. Probably just some rapid husky, they said.<br />
<br />
The first two officers that spotted her in the halls were taken down quickly. Their constant squawking on their radios made their positions obvious. The third shot her several times before retreating back. The bullet hit her in the shoulder. It hurt, mildly. It also healed quickly. She growled, and followed.<br />
<br />
By the time she made it to the main hall by the front door, a barricade of armed officers had already set up. They saw her, and although most froze in terror at the 9-foot tall monster before them, a few very quickly opened fire. She was annoyed. She charged forward. She leapt into their midsts, and she started biting and clawing at them all.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the attack, what was Jennifer suddenly had a surprise. One of the bullet hurt her. Hurt A LOT! She looked down at her right shoulder, and she could see a silvery slug stuck in a hole. She looked up in the direction the shot came from and-*BAM!* *BAM!*<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Jennifer inhaled deeply as she woke up in her bed. She felt as if someone had punched her right in the midsection and then drove a spike into her forehead. She sat up, and gasped. It took a few minutes for her to calm herself. Her heart was beating like a racehorse&#39;s. Then, she looked around her room. The clock read 5:55 AM, a few minutes before the alarm would go off.<br />
<br />
She relaxed herself. &quot;It was a nightmare. It was just a nightmare,&quot; she muttered. Standing up, she looked herself over. She looked as great as she usually did in the morning. Even better actually. And there wasn&#39;t a single wolf-like thing on her anywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re being silly,&quot; she berated herself. She quickly recovered herself and went down to the kitchen. She slowed down a little when she heard a noise. Looking in, she gave pause when seeing the maid, Martha, starting to put together breakfast. &quot;Uh, good morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha looked over, smiled, and ran over to hug her. &quot;Oh, Miss Jennifer. I was so worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was confused. &quot;Whu- what? Wait. I thought you had today off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha pulled back from her. &quot;Huh? Oh no. Just yesterday. Are you all right? We were worried sick about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worried sick? About what?&quot;<br />
<br />
The maid paused for a moment before answering. &quot;I don&#39;t think your parents are going to be mad at you for playing hooky yesterday. That&#39;s for certain. You didn&#39;t hear what happened at the school? A giant rabid dog-bear hybrid got loose. Killed near twenty students, three teachers, and five policemen. Many more are in the hospital. Where were you? What time did you come in? We were... they weren&#39;t releasing any names and we thought... We thought you had been....&quot; Martha&#39;s eyes teared, then she just dove forward and hugged her again, tightly.<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared off blindly, dumbstruck. &quot;Uh....&quot; No. Just no.</p>
