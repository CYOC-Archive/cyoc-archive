<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The stood out in the astroturf getting baked by the sun as emery sat next to the bucket filled with former football player. Another group of bubbles came up as they all started to get thirsty. &quot;In just a minute well have so bottles of water for you,in the meantime let me show you this machine here.&quot; The tour guide said as he jestered to emery and the group. Emery got up, leaving the bucket on the bench as he walked over to the group, glad he didn't drink up the former jock. &quot;Now if you see here, there is a pile of clothing, ready to be worn. But this clothing is heat gear in a way, a new form of under wear like under armour, only much more effective!&quot; He points to the machine where there is a spray bottle being filled with a black liquid of some kind. &quot;All you need to do is spray yourself with this liquid and a suit instantly appears onto your skin, which can be worn with regular football gear. It really is quit ingenious I must say!&quot; The guide smiled a little and gave himself a pat on the back. &quot;But unfortunatly, it does have some minor side effects that need to be tested first.&quot; The offensive end  that was with the group chimmed in as he grabbed the bottle, &quot;Well it sounds good to me! Let me strip down to my sivies and test this baby out&quot;Jim said as the guide tried to stop him but he just pushed him out of the way and threw off his shoes, socks and so on, till he was just in his underwear. &quot;I must insist you stop right now!&quot; Said the guide irratated. &quot;Who cares what you think, what's the worst that's gonna happen! I mean it's not like i'm gonna change to liquid or a football! So all's good!&quot; And with that he dropped his underwear and sprayed himself from top to bottom.&quot;Well you asked for it!&quot; Said the guide as the transformation began.<br />
<br />
At first jim saw that he was completly black from head to toe, even his hair and eyes lids were black! &quot;Wow this stuff feels great! I feel so cool in this hot sun!&quot; But as the guide held up a mirror to show jim just how sever it was he got the shock of his life. &quot;MY eyes! My teeth! There all black too! How did this happen!?&quot; Said jim in a panic.&quot;Well you see the chemical spreads not just on the inside my friend but, well let's surprise them all, shall we!&quot; The guid said as he motioned jim the the rack of footballs near the one goal post on the field. &quot;Will I hurt or be ok?&quot; The guide just looked at him reasuring and said &quot;Just practice kicking for a while, it will make you feel better.&quot; Jim started kicking as the sun baked his black skin, the whole time he felt so cool and light. Everyone just watched as the blackness began to make his muscle more defined, inching it's way down his his throat and into his assophigase. Charlie spoke up and stated &quot;Won't that hurt him? I mean won't he feel that?&quot; And became reasured as he saw jim still kicking the balls through the goal post. &quot;Now comes the fun part.&quot; said the guide as the referee brought some water. Everyone watched as jim began to feel a little weaker, and his skin became a little duller of a black, almost like material. The guide brought over a stadium chair as jim sat down and let his head fall back on the rest, his arms and legs dangling down off the sides.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked in amazment as jim said weakly, this suit feels so light, but so do I now? I feel so weak and thin..&quot; And with that he just sighed and laid back. As they watched he began too look more and more like spandex of some kind, his human features diisapearing by the minute. First his hands begand to look more hollow, collapsing on themselves. He very gently raised the dropped hand to see before letting it flop to the side. &quot;What's happening to me....&quot; He said with a soft sigh as his arms were next to defalte and dangle loosely on the chair. &quot;Why the suit and you are one now! I told you it was a little diffacult&quot; The guid then pointed to the other suits that lay in a pile. &quot;See it can only make you cool for so long in the sun, before it merges with you skin, thus taking control and making you the suit.&quot; As he said this jim looked down at his legs and feet, which had become flatter with a soft puff, like air being let out in a shirt. The guide jestered to kieshawn who was holding his ball, and said &quot;Why don't you give his big chest a poke?&quot; Kieshawn was reluctant at first but then did poke jim, who just laid there. It pushed in like a half inflated balloon that was slowly loosing air, except it was jim! &quot;Wow that's so weird! He can't feel that?&quot; A soft puff of air came out of jim, which sounded alot like no? <br />
<br />
As his chest collapsed on itself his head became less defined, taking on more of a hoody than a head. With a loud final sigh his head collapsed upon itself, and there in the chair lay a new under armour uniform, only no markings. As the guide picked him off the chair, he said to the croud &quot;Would anyone like a new under suit? I assure you there are no effect now, he's just a heat gear suit! And quit comfortable if i must say!&quot; As he mentioned this he took one of the gloves that was jim's hand and put it on. &quot;I will!&quot; Said jim's friend paulie. Paulie was a latino man who always did live under the shadow of jim &quot;That right there is a pretty comfy suit holmes!&quot; He said as he tried on the other glove. &quot;Well he's all yours! See the effects are perminent on him, unless of course you drop him into a sea of water, in which case he comes back, but more of a lifless empty headed suit that can move. See his brain and everything human is gone now, so he can only be an automaton!&quot; And as he smiled he tossed the jim outfit to paulie and said &quot;If you want to suit up, there's the locker room then, but no shower!&quot; And winked as the rest of the group moved on to the next room. &quot;Man holmes&quot; He said to the suit in front of him, &quot;I sorry you be a suit now, but oh oppy got himself something nice for two a days my friend! I promise I be wearing you every day at practice man!&quot; And walked toward the lockers.</p>
