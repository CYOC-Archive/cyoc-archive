<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Penny thinks about what to do, long and hard, and then reaches a conclusion. She cannot let Jeff live as her pussy. The thought is much But she does want to punish him. And with the Chronivac, she can easily do that. Her mean girl habits and attitude snap back and glimpse all the possibilities she can do. It is exhilarating. Extremely so. But first, Jeff. She looks through the Chronivac and reaches a decision. Yes, this will make the perfect punishment.<br />
&quot;Please, Penny. Change me back. I don&#39;t want to be a pussy. I want my life back. Please,&quot; begs Jeff. <br />
It is true she is his salvation. Penny knows it. And if she&#39;s going to use the Chroniovac for her own benefit later on, then she might as well do one good deed before. Well... Sort of. Let&#39;s just say that it will be a much better fate than being stuck as someone else&#39;s pussy. <br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she says mischievously. &quot;I&#39;ll free you from my body. It&#39;s not like I want a nasty perv around anyway. It&#39;s too gross.&quot;<br />
Jeff is overjoyed. Alas, it doesn&#39;t last long.<br />
&quot;However, since you like pussies so much, you can enjoy this fully!&quot;<br />
She clicks on the Chronivac, having made all the changes she wished, and lets Jeff get send into another world.<br />
<br />
It is a world of fay and strange demon-like creatures. One the Chronivac knows the existence of and may send people to, if the right selection is made. But Jeff doesn&#39;t know this. Or rather, he won&#39;t for a time. He doesn&#39;t get to see any of it either. He won&#39;t yet for a while too. All he knows is that he&#39;s somewhere moist. Warm, too. But dark. Completely dark. He freaks out at first. Is he an organ again? A vagina again? What sort of organ? What horrid function will he have to perform? What had Penny condemned him to? But he realised with relief that he can move. All on his own. Something he hasn&#39;t been able to do in such a long time... Relief washes through him. And ads he feel around, he notices he is very weal nonetheless. And were is he anyway? He can feel noises around him, and even... well, beyond. And rhythmic drum going on incessantly. And the walls of his prison, without being tight, are smooth and fleshy. His digits are puny, though. Mere stubs useless and really feeling where he is. <br />
And then he notices the rope. There&#39;s a rope-like sausage in here with him. Ugh! What is it for. He follows it gingerly and realizes it&#39;s attached to his belly! There&#39;s a parasite with him! Sucking his fluids and energy out and... And then he feels something erupting into his belly through the parasitic rope, flooding his belly and amazingly, it feels... good. Sweet. Creamy. No, it feels great! He then feels a pat and vibrations around him, as well as a deep rumbling voice, muttering reassurances. That&#39;s when Jeff understands. He&#39;s not a vagina, he&#39;s a baby! A foetus. He&#39;s not A vagina, but IN a vagina. Gross, yes, but much less disgusting. And his mommy just fed him through his umbilical cord. The meal is making him drowsy and he can feel a smooth regular motion and grave rumbling going on, fully reassuring him and rocking him to sleep, all the while hearing the regular beating of her heart.<br />
<br />
As the months pass by, Jeff is barely aware that time is moving on. For him, only now really counts. He knows he&#39;s a baby and that he&#39;s developing slowly but surely. His mommy feeds him, reassures him and is there all the time, soothing and loving. Jeff can feel her pats and adoration. She is so n ice, feeding him the yummiest foods! Yet he does think she&#39;s got a deep voice. And he hears other sounds from the outside. Mostly male, actually., But it doesn&#39;t matter if her voice is super deep. She loves him and it&#39;s the only thing that counts. Being in a womb feels disgusting, but for Jeff, it&#39;s nothing compared to being a pussy, so he sucks it up and slumbers as much as he can.<br />
<br />
Then, one day, his sleep is disrupted by his prison applying pressure upon him, again and again. More and more. With hurried, frightened voices from outside. Jeff wonders what it going on but quickly understands he must be about to be born. His mother is in labor and he&#39;s being pushed outside. Jeff is helpless to stop it and going through a vagina, with a full view of the wide mounds of the lips and the clitoris, all smooth and giant and bald, is enough to make him shout in disgust, as if the cold and new breathing through his lungs isn&#39;t enough. How vile! He doesn&#39;t want to see another vagina again! Then he feels pulled up, blinded and having no sense of his surroundings. What are people shouting about anyway? He feels examined roughly, washed in hot water then put into arms and get halfway under a warm blanket. Thank goodness, he thinks. Finally with Mommy, err... his new mother. A new mother that has very hairy arms. Huge, even, no matter he&#39;s a newborn infant. And it&#39;s not hair, it&#39;s fur! And though delicate, he can feel claws on his cheek. And the cooing... It&#39;s a deep male voice, coming from right above him! That voice had been deep, and accompanying him since his conception, but now that&#39;s outside, he can tell it&#39;s male, not even female! What the hell?!!? Then another male voice right next to him asks if the new baby is in good health.<br />
&quot;Well, yes, he&#39;s in perfect health. But Lord SwiftWind, if he looks like you, I regret to say the baby is male everywhere except on his lower genitalia.&quot;<br />
&quot;That IS unusual...&quot; says Definitely-Not-Mommy&#39;s voice.<br />
But the other voice smacks of dismissal.<br />
&quot;Well, if he&#39;s as good-looking as me, then he can be the mate of a high-ranking fae AND bear him children. Many would kill for the privilege  of bedding a fine individual like that.&quot;<br />
Jeff then sees the owner of the aristocratic voice kiss deeply Definitely-Not-Mommy on the mouth, full of love and passion. Jeff can see clearer now and he sees his Not-Mommy is a giant blue-furred beast with horns and yellow eyes. The other is a creature bright red.<br />
&quot;He is perfect, my love. You did great. I will love or common child as much as I love you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t wait too coddle him,&quot; smiles Not-Mommy.<br />
&quot;Of course. Now feed him. I want him in good health. Then we can reverse the spell and have you back with your testicles and penis as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
Jeff can hardly resist having a teat thrust in his mouth, warm milk gushing into his throat too fast to stop it. He drinks, because his new instincts push him too. That too, he is helpless to stop. It is too much to come to terms that&#39;s the offspring of monsters, that his Not-Mommy had him through a spell to make him female, that this spell made him be a guy BUT with a vagina and that obviously he&#39;s the darling son of a male monstrous couple. How vile! Yet he falls asleep once his belly is full, while understanding finally Penny&#39;s punishment.</p>
