<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days went by the same as every other weekend in recent memory.  You lounged around and played video games while the kobold did her chores.  There was still a slow flow of kobold cunt goo coming out of her slit, but beyond causing her to pause every few hours to wipe herself, nothing more seemed to come of it.  <br />
<br />
Of course, she was still horny as all get out.  You caught her glancing towards you with a look of utter desperation as she worked, but you’d been explicit about her order not to bother you and something in her kobold brain caused that order to override her body’s instincts.<br />
<br />
She was so well behaved that by Sunday afternoon you’d all but forgotten about her situation.  Laying down for a nap, you began to drift off to sleep when a deep, masculine hiss entered your ear – “What’s your favorite color, human?”<br />
<br />
“Red,” you yawned, only for the reality of the situation to dawn on you.  That voice hadn’t come from the kobold – someone was in your house!<br />
<br />
The fogginess of sleep was immediately burned away by a surge of adrenaline as your eyes flew open and you jumped out of bed, landing on your feet as you prepared to fight off the intruder.  It was then that you saw where the voice had come from, and adrenaline-fueled panic transformed into a bewildered confusion.  Standing in your doorway was a ghost, or at least it was transparent like one.<br />
<br />
You looked it up and down, growing more confused as you registered what you were looking at.  Sitting in your door was a transparent humanoid dragon.  It had a fierce muzzle with sharp teeth protruding from its gums, two lava filled eyes, a head covered in small spikes and horns, and a generally large, reptilian body complete with wings folded behind it and a tail that curled up on the ground.<br />
<br />
Standing there, it crossed its arms and laughed, before asking, “so human, do you like what you see?  You’re going to be seeing a lot more of it soon.  It’s not often that a human is given ownership of a kobold, and it’s even rarer that one neglects theirs as you have.  Perhaps the issue is that you simply don’t understand its needs?  Then let me teach you!”<br />
<br />
“I…” you tried to say, but you didn’t have time before the dragon raised a clawed hand towards you and a beam of red lightning shot into your body.<br />
<br />
Pain shot every fiber of your being as your clothes disintegrated around you.  Small horns and spines pushed out across your skull, followed by a cramp running through your stomach.  You bent over, just in time to see red scales begin to replace the skin on your aching feet while hands clasped onto your stomach as a red protrusion began to block the lower part of your vision.  Raising a hand to your face, you felt your palm meet the new muzzle that was growing out of it – and you saw the red scales that now covered your hand as well.  <br />
<br />
Your tongue burned as you felt it stretch out to match the new length of your muzzle, then you ran it along a row of growing, needle-like teeth.  Moving your hand in front of your face, you saw the tips of your fingers grow black and harden as they turned into small claws.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the dragon you… looked up at him.  Just seconds ago you’d been at eye level with one another, but now you were looking at his chest, and the longer you looked, the lower your vision got.  A burning ache came from your back and joints, along with the cracking of shrinking bones and you realized that you were rapidly losing height.<br />
<br />
The pain in your butt announced a new growth, as you felt a snakelike protrusion coming from the area just above your butt.  Your new tail dropped against your right leg, and you could… feel it – both the feeling of the scales on your tail pressing against your leg and the scales on your leg pressing against your tail.  As your tail finished lengthening, it suddenly grew stiffer as it thickened into a proper, lizard like tail.<br />
<br />
The final change occurred when the burning spread to your crotch, causing a hand to fly down and press into it – just in time to feel your cock and asshole both pull up into the same new slit that formed in the area between your new tail and legs.<br />
<br />
Then, as soon as it had come on, the aching, burning pain vanished, leaving you standing there, tail swaying behind you, in a room that looked much larger than it did before while the ghost of an anthropomorphic dragon towered over you.<br />
<br />
“What…” you managed to eek out in a shrill, raspy voice, only to be stopped by the fact that the next words just wouldn’t come to your mouth.  There was a vague, intuitive understanding of what you wanted to ask in the back of your mind, but somehow that intuition just wasn’t converting itself into words like it used to. <br />
<br />
Rubbing your forehead in an attempt to coax the words out of your head, all you managed was a simple, “what… Master do to Kobold?”<br />
<br />
Master?  Did you just call the dragon…<br />
<br />
You didn’t have time to finish the thought before the dragon burst into laughter, “why my little kobold, I made it so that you can understand the plight of your former servant!”<br />
<br />
“But…” was all you managed before, once again, the words seemed to fail you.  You knew that whatever you wanted to say was… complicated… but all you managed was “Kobold not understand?”<br />
<br />
Looking up at the giant of a dragon, you noticed that the smile on his face was unfazed as he looked down at you and said, “come, little one, I’ll show you.”<br />
<br />
The dragon turned and began walking towards the kitchen, giving you a full view of his ghostly but majestic wings, as well as the row of spines that ran from the top of his head to the tip of his thick, masculine tail.  <br />
<br />
Your body, for its own part, seemed to follow the dragon of its own volition.  There was an understanding in your mind that Master had told you to come with him and so you had no choice but to obey.  <br />
<br />
You could feel your short, thin legs moving; hear the small claws on your toes clicking against the wood floor; all while your abdomen wobbled back and forth by your tail swaying from side to side.  But it wasn’t you that was responsible for any of what was going on.  Your body just seemed to move without your input, for no other reason than that your Master had commanded it.  In your mind you had a vague feeling that if you could take control of yourself if you mustered enough willpower, but the amount of willpower that would require felt overwhelming.  It was as though your master’s voice was a torrent of water and all that you had to resist was the tiniest pebble of free will.<br />
<br />
You followed Master into the kitchen, and then to the same drawer where kobold’s ownership card was.  As soon as that thought entered your mind, there was a strange sense of déjà vu as you associated the word kobold with yourself, and it took some time for you to remind yourself that it was the not-you kobold’s card, not your card that was in that drawer.<br />
<br />
The dragon opened the drawer and pulled out the card, handing it to you.  Looking past the red muzzle that still filled the bottom of your vision, what you saw in your claws was a small plastic card with a picture of a red scaled kobold looking deadpan into the camera.  <br />
<br />
That was… the not-you kobold had purple scales, so why did…  Your eyes went to your hand, then to the red scales that covered it, then back to the red kobold on the card, then back to the scales on your hand.  This cycle kept repeating until, sensing your confusion, the dragon stated rather bluntly, “yes, kobold, that’s you.”<br />
<br />
“Is… Kobold?” was all you managed to mutter.<br />
<br />
“Yes, that’s your ID card, do you see where it lists your species as kobold?  Or how it lists me as your Master?”<br />
<br />
“I…” you looked back at the card.  You could see the picture of… you, but the rest of the card was just covered in lines that you couldn’t make any sense of.  You vaguely remembered seeing runes like this in video games but that didn’t make any sense.  Had you been transported into some fantasy world?<br />
<br />
Looking around, you saw the same house that you’d lived in before, even if it looked a lot bigger than it had earlier.  Then you looked towards the windows in your living room and saw the same backyard that you’d always had.  A glance towards the windows at the front of your house revealed that the neighborhood outside was also the same.<br />
<br />
“Is something the matter kobold?” <br />
<br />
“Kobold is… why is runes on kobold card?”<br />
<br />
“Runes?” came a curious reply, “why do you think there are runes on that card?”<br />
<br />
You just looked at the ghostly dragon with a blank look on your face.  Your body had an overwhelming desire to answer the dragon’s question, but you had no idea where to even begin.  Fortunately, you didn’t have to wait long before a flash of awareness went through the dragon’s face, and he seemingly changed the subject.<br />
<br />
“Hold one of your hands up in front of your face,” he commanded, with an instant reply as your right hand let go of the card and moved into position, “now, tell me how many fingers you have.”<br />
<br />
The question seemed so simple and yet, when you tried to remember how many fingers you had, nothing came to mind.  Peering deeper into your mind in search of the answer, you were surprised that what you were peering into wasn’t a vault filled with knowledge to be sorted through, but rather a black abyss.  The question of how many fingers your have should have been so simple, and yet… you had absolutely no idea.<br />
<br />
But the order was still in effect, so you switched to trying something else.  Staring at your fingers, you began to count from your thumb.  <br />
<br />
One.<br />
<br />
Then your index finger.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Nothing came.  You had a thumb and an index finger, so how many was that?  Well your thumb was one finger, which would make your index finger…<br />
<br />
More than one?  Higher than one?  Was it… many?  How many?  <br />
<br />
“Kobold has…”<br />
<br />
Back to the thumb.  ONE.  ONE FINGER.<br />
<br />
Then your index finger.<br />
<br />
Your mind went black.  If you have a thumb and another finger, that’s obviously more than one finger, but how many?  All you could think of was that it was more than one.<br />
<br />
Ok, you thought, just keep counting.  Your middle finger.  That’s a thumb, an index finger, and a middle finger.  So how many is that?  <br />
<br />
You tried pressing all of your fingers together until they were just one mass of fingers.  Ok, this should be easy.  You have one mass of fingers.  It’s obviously a lot of fingers but you’d reduced it down to one, so now you should be able to count them.<br />
<br />
One mass of fingers.<br />
<br />
No!  You need to count the individual fingers so just spread them apart and… as you spread your fingers apart the one mass of fingers suddenly divided itself up into so many objects that you lost track of what it was you were even looking at.  Deep down inside, you knew that there was a distinct number of fingers on your hand, but there were so many of them.  Even just looking at your index finger and middle finger felt overwhelming.  <br />
<br />
If you started at your index finger that was one, but as soon as you added more fingers in they just became so complicated and confusing.  You knew that there was more than one, you could even say that you had a lot of fingers – a huge number of fingers even – but exactly how many you had…<br />
<br />
You looked up to the dragon, confused over the answer to his question and afraid that whatever you gave would displease him, but you had no choice.  Your Master had asked a question and you had to answer, so you dug as deeply as you could into your mind, fired up every ounce of smartness that you had in your brain, and hissed out a shrill “Kobold has… a lot of many fingers.”<br />
<br />
“You have no idea, do you?”<br />
<br />
You stared shamefully at the floor.  “Kobold…”<br />
<br />
“And you think that your ID is written in runes because you have no idea what it says, correct?”<br />
<br />
Your tail dropped down, you body hunkered over, and you kept your vision pointed straight to the ground in submission, managing to only hiss out another “Kobold…” before the dragon interrupted you.<br />
<br />
“Well, let me tell you what it says.  It says that you’re a kobold with red scales.  You were born on thref, nountoin, doethreeson and fwaeyt.  You’re thref feet tall, weigh kriounti lout pounds, and are the property of me, Learexus.”<br />
<br />
Those words that the dragon said – you knew that some of them were supposed to be numbers but they were so foreign sounding.<br />
<br />
“Master, what thref?  Is more or less than kobold finger?”  The words came out of your mouth so quickly, and you felt a sense of pride well up in you that you had managed to ask a seemingly intelligent question.  If you could figure out what thref was, then maybe you could figure out how many fingers you had.<br />
<br />
The dragon also seemed surprised, and replied rather bluntly, “it’s less.”<br />
<br />
The gears began turning in your head.  Thref was less than how many fingers you had.  You had a lot of fingers, so thref was less than a lot.  It also must be more than one, unless… it wasn’t.  What if it was the same as one, or less?  You hadn’t considered that.  And how many more than one was it?  Was it a lot more?  If it was less than a lot but more than many would that make it?<br />
<br />
 “Don’t overwork that little brain of yours,” came another command from the dragon, immediately breaking your concentration and snapping your back to reality.<br />
<br />
“We’re going to play a little game, kobold.  As you have no doubt surmised, you have no memories of your life as a kobold, but that is the only life the world will ever think you lived.  I haven’t let you keep your human memories because they will be useful to you, or because I am generous.  Those are memories of a life that never existed, and I’ve left you with them to make the transition to your new life all that much harder.  Now, before we begin, do you have anything that you want to say to me.”<br />
<br />
That last command freed you from whatever shackles your body had imposed on your mind.  Now free to fully contemplate the situation, you felt yourself shrink even deeper into the world than you already had.  You knew what had happened to Molly – reality had changed so that Molly had never existed and, if what the dragon was saying is true, the same had happened to you.  You were stuck in this small, weak body, destined to live out the rest of your life as a glorified albeit willing slave to a dragon that you knew nothing about.<br />
<br />
The implications of that alone were frightening, but what was even more terrifying was your inability to perform even the most basic mental tasks just a… time ago.  Why couldn’t you count?  Was the writing on the card really some indecipherable runes?  The dragon didn’t think so, so did that mean you couldn’t read?  Molly had lost a lot of her intelligence when she had transformed, so did that mean that you had as well?  Were you now so stupid that you couldn’t count past one?  <br />
<br />
It was a terrifying realization, especially since you might be stuck for this for the rest of your life which… you didn’t even know how long that was.  No, it wasn’t that you didn’t know, you couldn’t even comprehend it.  One life, that was all you could understand.  The concept of time seemed very complicated and obtuse.  Yes, there were years, but how many?  A lot?  How many was a lot?  And how long was that?  <br />
<br />
“Please Master,” you eeked out, “Kobold not want be Kobold.  Please make Kobold back.”<br />
<br />
The dragon looked down at you and a ghostly hand pretended to pat you on the head.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry little kobold, I told you that we were going to play a game, so we will.  You’re now a part of my warren, as you have always been, but I’ll give you a way to turn back.  I’m on a trip with the rest of my warren, I’ll be back in frifg days.  If you managed to impregnate your friend, the purple kobold, in that time, then I’ll change you back to a human.”<br />
<br />
“Frifg?” you hissed, “is that…”<br />
<br />
“Its more than Thref and less than Eytee.  Or maybe it’s less than Thref and more than Eytee.  Would the answer really matter to you?  Would you be able to understand it even if I explained, in the simplest terms possible, how much frifg actually is?  I told you that it’s a number of days, so I won’t be back before sundown today.  Can you at least understand that?”<br />
<br />
Not before sundown today.  You had no idea how long that was, but it was still light outside, so you probably had a lot of time in which to do it.  Or maybe you didn’t.  Your brain’s inability to comprehend how big anything was made the dragon’s words all the more true – how long you had didn’t matter to you.  You had to try.  If you had enough time you did, if you didn’t, then you didn’t.  You didn’t want to be stuck as a kobold, so what other choice did you have?</p>
