<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning arrived and I woke up excited for the great day before me. I was still heartbroken from Andrew, but I knew I had to do my best today. Besides who know, but maybe the man I&#39;ll meet today will be even better then Andrew.<br />
I looked at myself in the mirror, it was unbelievable to see that beautiful woman staring back at me. Few weeks ago I couldn&#39;t imagine having pair of boobs, and now I can&#39;t think of myself without them.<br />
&quot;Something happened last night with Andrew?&quot; Roxy asked behind me.<br />
&quot;How did you knew?&quot; I replied.<br />
&quot;Common girl, I can read you like an open book. Besides there are enough man for you, and with your hot body you could get anyone you want&quot; she said as she squeezed by boobs.<br />
&quot;hmmm thank you Roxy&quot; I moaned, I am so lucky I have such a wonderful roommate.<br />
&quot;Roxy, do you afraid of becoming a bimbo?&quot; I asked her as we got dressed.<br />
&quot;I am not sure anymore&quot; she answered. &quot;I was terrified when I first arrived here, I didn&#39;t wanted to become a women. But now that I do, I learned to love it, who knows maybe I will get the same experience as a bimbo&quot;.<br />
She did got a point, should I really be so much against becoming a bimbo?<br />
<br />
We got to our class room, and Mistress lead us to another room in the academy. It was filled with clothing, make up kits, and mirrors.<br />
&quot;Listen ladies&quot; Mistress said, &quot;you will spend the next day in this room, getting ready for your date. I want you to think what impression you want to leave on men, and dress accordingly&quot;.<br />
What impression I want to leave? That is a good question. I was still angry about Andrew. I wanted a man that will help me forget him. A man that will fuck me so hard I won&#39;t think about Andrew anymore. That it, I knew the word I was looking for. Lust. That what I want men to think when they see me.<br />
I want to the dresses section and tried some red dresses. After trying some I picked a rather short and tight one with revealing cleavage. The red dress with my long black hair will surely show how lusty I am. I added a black push up bra that showed my boobs even better, and matching black panties. I also picked black high heels that fit my dress perfectly. <br />
I went to the make up section when I met Roxy. She was wearing blue dress that fit her blonde hair perfectly.<br />
&quot;You look so cute&quot; I said to her.<br />
&quot;Thank you, that exactly what I was looking for, Cute. I want a strong man that can protect me. That why I want to look like innocent and cute. But I also picked red bra and panties, to show that underneath I can be a monster in bed&quot; she said.<br />
We helped each other do her make up, and thanks god Star arrived to help us, after all she is our class expert. Star was wearing all pink, from dress to heels. She said she wanted to show her femininity. <br />
<br />
The evening arrived, and we were all ready for our final exam. We got split and each of us got into a different taxi. After 10 minutes of driving the taxi stopped at the front of a night club. They already told us they got people following us, so there is no point in escaping.<br />
I entered the club and sat alone at the bar. I ordered some drink from the handsome bartender and started to get into the club vibes. I could see all the men watching me, some of them looked really good. My eyes got into contact with a good looking man. He was exactly what I was looking. Strong and bulky, with manly beard and big arms. I winked at him as I passionately bit my lips.<br />
The man immediately stood up and approached me.<br />
&quot;Hello my name is Malcolm, I saw you and I knew I had to get to know you&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;And why do you think I will be interested in you?&quot; I played hard to get.<br />
&quot;How about I buy you a drink while you tell me you name?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Sure, why not&quot; I replied. I wanted him so bad, but I had to play hard to get. That what men love.<br />
&quot;My name is Lexus&quot; I said as I got my drink.<br />
&quot;It does fit such a luxurious girl like you&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;You sure good at flattering a girl&quot; I giggled.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not flattering, its telling the truth. Can&#39;t a man be honest for once?&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;If you are really that honest, so what is the reason you want to know me so much&quot; I asked him.<br />
&quot;Well first of all do to this&quot; he said and kissed me. I was surprised but delightful. He didn&#39;t waste time, and went straight to his goal. He knew what women really want, and he delivered.<br />
&quot;You are such a good kisser&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;So are you&quot; I said back.<br />
We spent some time at the bar flirting and kissing when he offered me to come to his place. Without hesitation I agreed and went after him.<br />
We got into his apartment, and run straight to his bed room. I got him undressed, while he took off my dress. Now I could see his big bulky muscles in front of me. I really did picked the right man. <br />
&quot;You look amazing&quot; he said to me as he unclipped my bra.<br />
&quot;Fuck me already&quot; I said to him, I was already wet down there. <br />
He immediately revealed his cock, and shoved it into my pussy. It was heaven. Like a fireworks exploding all over my body, I moaned as waves of pleasure hit me with every thrust. He increased the pacing as I was completely lost in bliss.<br />
Eventually we both climaxed at the same time, it was the peak of my life. The feeling I never felt, and never dreamed was even possible to experience.<br />
I collapsed on his body as he hugged me.<br />
&quot;You passed the exam&quot; he said to me.<br />
&quot;I am what?&quot; I was a bit confused.<br />
&quot;I know you are from the Bimbo Academy, and I know you used to be a man. They pay me to visit the club and test the new women in their graduation test&quot; he explained.<br />
&quot;So it was all fake?&quot; I asked him.<br />
&quot;Not at all&quot; he said. &quot;They never told me which one of the girls are from the Bimbo Academy. All I know is that I need to go to the girl I find the most attractive. And since your test is to be attractive to other men, it is also a way to test you. Besides I really do like you. If you weren&#39;t to become a bimbo, I would definitely date you, but sadly I am not into bimbos&quot; he said.<br />
He felt really genuine, and I could tell he really did liked me. &quot;That fine, you made me feel really special&quot; I said as I kissed him.<br />
But then I broke our kiss, as I had a new idea.<br />
&quot;How about we escape? We can leave this place, go far away from here. I could be your girlfriend&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
I looked deeply into his eyes, waiting for his answer.</p>
