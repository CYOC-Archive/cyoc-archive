<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>You have to know that modern conservatives are very different from conservatives of a century ago. During the 1800s, nude swimming by men was traditional and therefore a conservative value. At that time, modesty was only for women as women were expected to be fully covered at all times.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked over to where he had laid another book that he had been reading. The book was about the Olympics. He had particularly been fascinated by the description of the Ancient Greek Olympics. There was also a story that he didn&#39;t know if it was true or not but it told how the first Americans preparing to enter the Olympics did not know much about the modern Olympics and so had tried to imitate the Ancient Greek Olympics to their embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Jeff wondered, &quot;How do I make changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned the page and read, &quot;Think about what you want to change and then turn the page.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff thought about bringing Ancient Greek attitudes back to the modern world. But since Jeff was not a historian, his thoughts had a very gay flavor that the true Ancient Greeks did not have.<br />
<br />
He turned the page and read, &quot;When the Olympics were recreated in 1896, attitudes about modesty required athletes to wear clothes but controversies began to arise as athletic wear began to be invented that was seen to give certain athletes an unfair advantage. There were also concerns about wool fibers clogging the pool filters and poor athletes from rural areas that couldn&#39;t afford athletic wear. Although Evangelicals pushed for modesty and feminists pushed for more co-ed options, conservatives pushed back and won protecting nude athletics. The controversy never went away as different parts of the world have different standards when it comes to athletic wear but in America, modesty for men was eliminated. Women were allowed to compete in athletics and their athletic wear did become skimpier but women were still expected to be modest. But even in co-ed athletics, men were expected to compete nude except for protective clothing such as pads for football players and warm clothing for winter sports.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff then thought about gender roles. He turned the page and read, &quot;Although progress has been made in bringing equality between the genders, the overall attitude in America is still that men should be men and women should be women. Any blurring of the line between men and women is discouraged. However, the gender role of masculinity has begun to focus on athletic prowess and virility. Men are encouraged to develop their bodies, to be proud of their bodies and to be proud to display their bodies in all their glory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to read, &quot;American football became a passing fad as rugby, wrestling, swimming, track and field, martial arts, male figure skating, and gymnastics have become more popular in America, all done in the nude except for shoes where appropriate. Wrestlers, swimmers, martial artists and gymnasts don&#39;t even wear shoes and aren&#39;t allowed any clothing of any kind. Swimmers are known to shave everything to increase their speed in the water and male figure skaters are known to decorate their bodies with body paint and non-clothing accessories like weird hats or long scarves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to read, &quot;In fact, the most American sport has become a form of wrestling where the opponents get extra points for jamming their cocks into each other. Although the one who gets fucked is shamed, it&#39;s only the mild shame of being a loser as the phrase, &quot;You win some, you lose some&quot; has become popular. Even the greatest athletes of all time acknowledge that everybody loses sometimes. There&#39;s no shame in having taken it up the backside on occasion as long as it is within an athletic competition. The only shame is in taking it up the backside outside of an athletic competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to read, &quot;Modern physique standards focus on a balance of muscle and fat. That is big bulging muscles with zero fat is not considered the ideal physique. The ideal man is expected to have muscles but to also have some fat. Large pecs are not popular. Six pack abs are not popular. Gigantic biceps are not popular. But a physique like Michelangelo&#39;s David or Michelangelo&#39;s ignudi, especially the stone mason located near the separation of the waters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Jeff looked up from the book. That&#39;s when he noticed ripples emanating from the book. He also felt some changes happening to himself. He&#39;d always wanted to be involved in athletics but growing up in a rural town like Sandy Springs didn&#39;t give him much in the way of opportunities. He had muscles from farm work but he didn&#39;t have the stocky build that suited American football. But as the ripples of change passed over him, his physique changed.<br />
<br />
There happened to be an antique, full length in the hall. Jeff went out and looked at himself. He looked exactly like Michelangelo&#39;s stonemason ignudi. He pulled off his shirt and looked at his perfect physique. Then he got worried whether his jewels had shrunk or not so he pulled open his pants to see. Not only had they not shrunk but they were just a bit better looking. He guessed that his length was seven inches, not monstrous but not bad and his balls hung lower. He had also grown back his foreskin.<br />
<br />
One of the beer drinking guys, Josh, walked by and said, &quot;Quit showing off. Everyone already knows your the best looking guy in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff put his clothes back on and went back to the library. Some more ripples passed and this time, Jeff&#39;s clothes changed. He now wore a cobalt blue, form fitting, long sleeved shirt with his heather grey sweatpants. Both items had the Sandy Springs logo on them. Jeff looked down at his backpack where a pair of ice skates appeared. Jeff wondered where the ice rink was and suddenly realized there was now an ice rink where there hadn&#39;t been one before. The book had transformed Jeff into a figure skater.<br />
<br />
And a wrestler, the very kind that took it up the ass occasionally.<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed other minor changes especially in the books in the library. There were now pictures of naked athletes where there hadn&#39;t been any before. There weren&#39;t a ton of these pictures  but to go from absolutely zero pictures of naked men to this was significant. There was even a picture of the most popular wrestler with his cock up the ass of his opponent. His opponent was also very popular but less popular than Wally &quot;The Stabber&quot; Falcone.<br />
<br />
Jeff wondered what else had changed so he got up and wandered the mansion. The beer drinkers hadn&#39;t changed one bit but the guy having sex in the master bedroom had become more handsome. The guy having sex yelled, &quot;Stop watching, you perv.&quot; and threw a pillow so Jeff left.<br />
<br />
That guys name was Wayne and he was also a wrestler. Jeff had new memories of he and Wayne taking each other&#39;s cocks up the ass in wrestling competitions but Wayne was straight and didn&#39;t want Jeff to look at his girl.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided it was time to go home. He put the magic book in his backpack and snuck away from the abandoned mansion. He wondered what his life would be like now. He had a few days before his next wrestling match but tomorrow, he had an appointment for tryouts to become an Olympic figure skater. He already had permission to leave school part way through the school day for tryouts.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly realized, this meant that tomorrow, he would have to strip off all his clothes and skate naked in nothing but body paint and long body chains in front of his family, friends and the judges.</p>
