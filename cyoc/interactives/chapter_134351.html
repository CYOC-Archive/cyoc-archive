<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harold awoke but slowly, feeling no pains, but was smiling. He was recanting that wild fun night in his memories, as he had gone to visit Molly the pony mare. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your memories of Molly are still vivid,&quot; taunted Demonica as she wanted to continually refer to his fun fling he remembered still, as told to friend Alex.<br />
<br />
Molly and Harold had spent three hours that one night enjoying the company of a mutual lover. The small farm was the home owned by a university professor, and he had seven pony mares kept as pets for shows and breeding. Mike had told his brother who told Harold about Molly being the more recent acquisition procured by the professor. Mike had told about the Pony mares Freda, Betsy, Carla, Hilda, Kerry, Tamika, and then the more recent pony Molly were originally students. Alex listened when Mike told what he had learned, but Harold did not believe the tale as true until he had his more personal fun fling with Molly.<br />
<br />
The Philosophy professor received as a gift a magical artifact found by a university colleague at some Brazilian ruins dig. The Professor studied the artifact, using Mike as an understudy student to do the legwork checking with other archaeological professors who did studies of similar artifacts. What Mike did to prove the magical state the artifact held as governed, he offered as proof his less than human genitals, showing to his brother Alex what had happened to his maleness. Mike was well able to mate with Molly, and did that wild night, but not allowing Harold to see the proof of the pudding.<br />
<br />
Harold listened to Mike talking to Molly as though the mare was able to understand language, as comprehending the verbal essence of what Mike said, asked, and got the mare to answer by pawing a fore-hoof, once to state Yes and twice pawed to state a No answer.<br />
<br />
When Harold returned to pay his visit to Molly, he did the similar asking of her what Mike told to Alex. Harold thought that Molly felt appreciative of the Professor for what he caused to happen; he changing her to become as one of his pet pony mares. Harold learned that the fun fling with Mike had thrilled her, he being physically equal his genitals to those of a small breed horse. <br />
    <br />
Demonica wanted Harold to recall his fun time when he visited Molly, as she thought to use his memories to taint him physically. <br />
<br />
Harold sat on the basement floor swooning of sensual fun he felt from mutual feelings happening to Molly and him. &quot;Do tell now, as after you two shared each the other in lust and mating, your fling was interrupted by the learned Professor arriving at his home and farm.<br />
<br />
You led Molly back to her stall and had just enough time to go hide behind some hay bales, as you listened while the Professor talked to his pet pony mares. He tended to his pets, talking to each as he fed and gave them fresh water poured into steel pails.  As Harold watched only Molly, Tamika, and Kerry reacted as if knowing enough to bow and give their owner some manner of thanks. The Professor wished his pets a good night as he walked back to the main house to shower, relax, read and go to bed. It was after midnight before the bedroom light winked out and Harold had his chance to escape the barn.<br />
<br />
A month later and Alex called Harold to tell him his brother Mike was missing. The police searched but no signs were found of Mike and he was listed as another missing person. It was a vivid memory to Harold that when he was showering and cleaning the day&#39;s sweat off and down the drain, he had a thought about where Mike might have gone, and gone then missing.<br />
<br />
The mentality of Demonica was at work taunting back vivid memories of what Harold knew, and the reasoning why he hated furry folks. Harold called Alex and the two friends went back to the pony barn, as Harold had an idea that Mike went alone to pay a friendly visit to Molly. The boys arrived at the barn being tired and sweaty. They carefully entered the pony barn and went to meet Molly, she standing in her stall. Harold began to question her, but when he made mention the name Mike a pony whinnied loudly from the stall at the far end of the barn. <br />
<br />
As then too did Molly, Kerry, and Tamika did whinny, the boys walked along the barn aisle and saw there a new pony. The new pony was wild eyed showing the whites of his eyes as he acted anxious.<br />
<br />
Harold was first to speak and as asking of the pony he said, &quot;Mike, is this the new you?&quot; To which the pony bowed to Harold and Alex slid the stall door open, as entered and went to petting his accursed brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, Mike is this you, mom and dad are worried, what can I tell them?&quot; Alex asked of his brother.<br />
<br />
Harold watched as did Alex as Mike began pawing a fore hoof twice, doing it again and again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No? You mean I should not tell them that I found you alive,&quot; Alex asked, as Harold remarked then, &quot;And who would believe such a fantastic story?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mike,&quot; Harold recalled saying, &quot;You gained a big horse cock from the artifact when you tested it at college. Did it leave you a stallion or are you a mare like your girlfriends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex knelt low and all he said was &quot;Oh wow, yup he is a stallion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold and Alex stayed late to talk and ask many questions of Mike, and discovered that Molly was a dear friend to Mike, she worked as a typist secretary for the Professor before she left the college without any notice. Molly whinnied when she overheard Harold make the accusation about Mike and her being lovers before she became a pony mare. As they were lovers again, and often as Mike by the demands of his present owner insisted his stallion breed with mares, some born as mares.<br />
<br />
Harold was ready to leave but Alex wanted to stay by his brother, he loved his elder brother, no matter that he was an animal and never to be again as a human.</p>
