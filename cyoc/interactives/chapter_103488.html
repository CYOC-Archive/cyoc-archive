<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well?&quot; said Kelly, staring at the unchanged Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it takes a little while, &quot; said Mary, looking over her body.  Her whole body tingled, but she saw that nothing had changed ..... yet.  &quot;I think it took several minutes for the first one to kick in.  Maybe each one is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly looked skeptical.  She was still rifling through the box, pulling out a few vials.  &quot;Whatever.  If I don&#39;t see something soon, I am going to call the police, regardless of how you look and what you know about Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary was beginning to sweat.  She wasn&#39;t sure if it was because of the fear or her impending transformation.  Suddenly her stomach lurched as she dropped several inches in height.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My God! It does work, &quot; said Kelly in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;See!  I told you, &quot; said Mary with a triumphant smile.  She suddenly dropped several more inches in height.  Her baggy clothes felt even more loose.  &quot;Very funny.  I guess you decided to make me even younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite, &quot; said Kelly with smile.  She had grabbed some more cups and was pouring the contents of the vials she had taken out of the box into them.  It appeared like she was combining the potions, mixing them into a new cup.<br />
<br />
Mary lurched downward again, and felt sick at her stomach.  She now found her head level with Kelly&#39;s waist.  She had lost over a foot in height, and she was beginning to get nervous for some reason.  Her heart was racing in her chest.  &quot;You made me shorter?&quot; asked Mary with apprehension.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close.  But not just shorter.  Take a good look at yourself,&quot; said Kelly, as she gulped down the mixture of potions she had created for herself.<br />
<br />
Mary looked at her shaking hands.  They were a pale pink color.  Her nails were longer and looked sharp, like claws.  The hair on her forearms was thicker, and was a pale white color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly, what have you done to me?&quot; asked Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, relax, &quot; said Kelly, as she walked over to the couch and sat down to watch the show.  &quot;I am just having a little fun.  I&#39;ll change you back after  I am done.  I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary was glad she had only she had drunk a portion of the cup&#39;s contents and not the whole thing.  But how much had she had?  2/3?  3/4?  And what was she changing into exactly?  Mary had now shrunk to two feet and easily slid out of her clothes.  She was shocked to see that her whole body was now covered in this soft white fur.  Well, except for her hands and feet, which had extended into long thin paws with thick pink pads.  She felt a tickle above her ass, and saw a thin pink tail extending for her spine.  She grabbed it with her paw, feeling it get longer and thicker in her hands.  Soon, it was as long as her body.  But that was not a difficult feat, as her body continued to shrink.  She scurried over to a mirror and confirmed what she had guessed.  She reached up and felt her ears grow larger and more round.  Her tiny pink nose tickled as large thin whiskers grew beneath it on her lips.  She winced and closed her eyes as her mouth extended into a long muzzle.  When she opened her eyes, she saw a mouse staring back at her.<br />
<br />
Well, mostly mouse.  Because she had only taken a portion of the vial  she still had some human features.  Although her breasts were much smaller and covered by fur, they were still present on her chest.  And she still had a slight hourglass shape, with a thin waist. She still had some dexterity in her hands, and she could hold objects.  Likewise, she could still easily stand on the balls of her feet and walk like a human.  And mercifully her shrinking had stopped at about 12 inches in height.  In short, she looked liked some kind of anthropomorphic animal from a cartoon or something, like that little mouse from the Secret of NIMH or maybe closer to one of those mice from the Rescuers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you cheated, &quot; said Kelly above her.  &quot;Well, that&#39;s okay.  I cheated a little, too.  I guess that makes the game I have planned a little more fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary looked up at Kelly with shock.  She had been so wrapped up in her own changes she had failed to notice the changes in her friend.  Kelly&#39;s upper body and torso looked normal.  Well, aside from her forked tongue and strange yellow eyes.  But her lower body was monstrous.  From her waist down, her body was covered in thick scales.  She no longer had legs.  They had merged into a long snakelike tail.  Mary was immediately reminded of the snake women from legends .... the naga.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly, what have you done to yourself?&quot; asked Mary in shock.  Her little mouse heart raced at the sight of Kelly&#39;s new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like it?  It took a little bit of planning to get it just right for our game,&quot; said Kelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Game?  What game?&quot; said Mary angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, a game of hide and seek, silly.  I made you into a mouse so you could hide, and I am going to find you.  To do that I needed to be a little bit snake.  Not too much, mind you.  I didn&#39;t want to become feral or something.  And I had to add a little bit of the &#39;human&#39; and &#39;growth&#39; vials so I wouldn&#39;t get too small or lose my hands.   But enough talk - let&#39;s play,&quot; said Kelly.<br />
<br />
Mary shrank back.  &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to play this game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, relax,&quot; said Kelly.  &quot;I am not really going to hurt you.  And we can change right back after I have finished having my fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; said Mary firmly.  She tried to act brave, but her rapidly beating heart betrayed her fear.<br />
<br />
Kelly chuckled.  &quot;I don&#39;t think you have much choice.  I am going to hunt you no matter what.  So you probably better get going.  Although, I must confess I think I might have a slight advantage.  I can smell your fear, almost taste it&quot; said Kelly as she flicked out her forked tongue.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Stop it. This isn&#39;t funny,&quot; said Mary, as she began to back away from the snake woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready or not, little mousey, here I come.  Better run, &quot; said Kelly, as she sprang forward towards Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary dodged her with surprising speed and fled into the bedroom.  Kelly&#39;s long tail struck the coffee table as she followed, shaking the cups with the remaining contents of the vials Kelly had used.<br />
<br />
Hmm, better watch that.  I need to learn to control my tail better, thought Kelly.  Don&#39;t want it to get me into any trouble.<br />
<br />
Then she chased after Mary, slithering into the bedroom.</p>
