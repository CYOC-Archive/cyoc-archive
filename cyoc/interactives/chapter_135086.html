<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aaah!&quot; Jason screamed as he woke up. He looked around and noted he was in his bedroom. &quot;Oh,  thank God. It was just a nightmare...&quot;<br />
<br />
He dizzily and slowly went to the bathroom and washed his face as he use to do everyday. His stomach trembled because he was hungry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I need my protein.&quot; He smiled. &quot;As the coach says: A big gut makes a big man good for a big game.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled foolishly for a second when he realized what he said. Suddenly, his eyes opened completely and he saw himself in the mirror in front of him.<br />
He saw his face, but it was completely different. Angular, with a prominent jaw that was hiding under the biggest beard he had seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Impossible!&quot; He muttered while he touched the hirsute hairs that surrounded his lips. That&#39;s when he saw his hand, or maybe he should call them mitts, because they where ridiculously huge and calloused. They felt strong and numb at the same time.<br />
With his hands, he also saw his arms. Brawny and beefy oaks covered in a thick layer of fur that lead two the biggest patches of armpit bushes he had seen in his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck!&quot; He shouted when he smelled the terrible BO coming from them. He immediately tried to hide them under his huge sleeves which looked like cannonballs attached to his broad back. He didn&#39;t see it,  but some hairs had grew them too. He didn&#39;t mind about it because he was too distracted seeing the bowling balls that he called pecs. Touching them was like touching a rock. How weird it feels to him!<br />
He tried to look for his nipples but it was difficult with the hairy rug that covered all his chest. Those hairs also hid the 8-pack that he didn&#39;t knew he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; He shouted again in a deep baritone. His neck was so thick that although his Addams apple was huge it was hiding inside there. &quot;I&#39;m a bear! Am I still a teenager?&quot;<br />
<br />
He moved his hands to his pubes, the huge and messy bush under his abs, and sighed a second before he touched his junk. This body was the one from his nightmare, so he was almost sure of the behemoth he has down there, but when he was resigned to touched, something went wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dick!! Where is it?!!!&quot; He yelled when he didn&#39;t find it under all the hair he has on his crotch. He was desperately figuring out what happened to it. His balls were there, huge as cantaloupes and hairy as coconuts. His legs, meaty and hairy were there too. So, where is his cock?<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t remember what happened and the initial panic became even worse. In the desperation he tore off some of his bushes. It hurted as hell but it was ridiculously easy to do with his new strength, but no dick was there just a little pee hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m dickless! I&#39;m fucking dickless!!&quot; Jason yelled completely mad. Apparently, he can&#39;t remember what happened but,  in the middle of all his anger, a name popped in his head: Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;That son of a bitch!!&quot; He rumbled. &quot;I don&#39;t know what he do or how but he has made something to my dick! I&#39;ll go to his house right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t showered, shaved or anything. He was reeking and was a walking furball but he didn&#39;t care.<br />
At first, he struggled to remember where his clothes are, but he managed to wear an old wife beater that didn&#39;t do a good job to hide the fur on his chest or armpits. He also found some shorts but,  although he tried to find some boxers or at least a jockstrap, he didn&#39;t find any underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I have to hide?&quot; He resigned. &quot;I&#39;ll go commando as always!&quot; He hesitated a second. Did he say as always? &quot;Shit! What &#39;s happening with my mind?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was almost done, except for his shoes. He hasn&#39;t noted it before but he has a pair of clown feet. He had mixed feelings of shame and proud. Big feet are disgusting he thought at first, but at the same time he thought they made him look more manly. He can&#39;t stop clenching his fat toes while he admired his size 18 feet.<br />
He found some shoes, some really big shoes, but they stunk so strong like if they have dead animals inside. He tried to use them anyway by wearing socks, but the socks that he found smelled even worst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! I&#39;m fucking disgusting!&quot; Jason blamed and finally decided to go out with a pair of flip flops that he found under his bed. He also found other stuff like porn magazines and used condoms but he wasn&#39;t surprised at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. Now I&#39;m ready to kill that son of a bitch!&quot; He took a glimpse at himself before leaving. He looked like a brute caveman or something worst. &quot;AAAAAAAAAhh!!&quot; He raged one last time before he left the room.</p>
