<br />
It had been one year since the entire human race changed forever.  365 days ago men and women switch genitals giving men vaginas and women dicks.  When the change happened men had gained fully functional vaginas, meaning the could be impregnated.  In gaining vaginas, men also had gained birthing hips to hold their new wombs.  Women lost their hips since there was no reason they would need such wide hips.  <br />
<br />
Speaking on men getting pregnant, many became pregnant mere days after the change over.  Most of it was due to the fact that some couples were having sex at the time of the change, and with men losing their dicks they also lost their condoms that fell off.  Also, since men weren't on birth control pills it made it easier for the women to impregnate their men.  Also, many found the change arousing and curiosity got the better of many folks which lead to biggest birthing rate since the baby boom era of the mid 1940s.<br />
<br />
As Jack would make his observations, he noted that the genitals weren't the only changes the human bodies took.  Aside from the hips, other sexual characteristics changed over time.  Since women now had testes, they produced more testosterone, which with fir women helped them gain more muscle mass.  Also, breasts lost their feminine roundness and women grew more hair on their bodies then before.  Men, now with more estrogen going through their bodies,  they started developing boobs and secreting milk.  <br />
<br />
Even with the anatomy change, men still &quot;ruled&quot; the world, but when more men becoming mothers it slowly become more relevant for women to be the breadmakers of the family.  Rapes went down as women weren't as aggressive as men had been with their dicks, although it still happened.  Rapists were heavily effected.  In fact, one guy who had raped numerous women found himself pregnant with 13 children.<br />
<br />
As far as clothing went, women had to the jeans and pants modified to fit better on their thinner hips, while the opposite happened with men.  Since women now had bugles, them wearing short shorts and skirts were no worn by them anymore.  In fact, after some time passed, men started wearing skirts and dresses, although it wasn't a huge trend.  Underwear changed as more women wore boxers that properly held their new equipment and men started wearing more panties.  Women still were all about fashion, but in different ways espcially once their chests became more hairy and floppy.  Cleavages were more embarrassing for women because of their new traits.  Once men had more defined breasts, they started wearing bras and at first were hesitant to show cleavage, but that was changing too.<br />
<br />
Even with the genital swap, men were still referred to as men and women were still women.  Pronouns hadn't changed, either.  Some things had changed though, such as feminine hygiene was know called masculine hygiene.  Babies born in the last year with vaginas were given male names and babies with dicks were given traditional female names, on the off chance that the genitals would swap back.  Scientists and doctors however have observed that the babies recently born will grow up like traditional girls and boys, because their bodies still had to develop.<br />
<br />
Jack was happy with the results and loved his vagina.  He hadn't become pregnant, but he loved his various vibrators he bought himself.  His breasts started developing after a few months and they were fun to play with too.  He has had girlfriends, but none that have lasted.  He did love giving them blowjobs, which he thought he wouldn't.  Looking at his notebook, he noticed it was one year ago he had made the wish that changed humanity.  He could now change it back to normal, but he was thinking about leaving it as is.  He thought the world was much better off.  Maybe he could do something different?</p>
