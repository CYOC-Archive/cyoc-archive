<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Entering her apartment, Christina Smith flipped the lights on and plopped into her couch without a second thought. Caressing her forehead, she stared blankly into her TV, neglecting to even turn it on. She frowned. Out of a job again! This afternoon her employer announced they were downsizing and that she was, unfortunately, on the layoff list. Oh, eff off! She&#39;d seen it before; they just needed an excuse to get rid of some people so the fatcats could earn bigger paychecks! Infuriated, she discarded her work attire then and there and went into her bedroom to slip on something more casual. By the time her phone started to ring, the 21-year-old blonde was now outfitted in a red turtleneck top, High Rise Levi&#39;s, and a pair of red Chucks. Looking at her phone, she smiled as she saw who it was...  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there!&quot; she answered! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Baby!&quot; *honk**honk* &quot;How ya doing?&quot; Upon hearing your voice, a strange excitement came over Christina. Grinning, she responded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, not too good. Just lost my job...but hearing your silly voice is enough of a cure for me&quot;. You just laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;A-HYUCK! Well, I aim to please! I just got hired at the circus, baby!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?! Congratulations!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Hun! Wanna celebrate with a mutual *honk* at your place?&quot; The remark caused Christina to burst into giggles. No matter what, Buttons could always make her laugh! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Buttons! You silly....hee-hee-hee” For some reason, the young woman’s giggling fit wouldn’t let up. An uncontrollable giddiness had just taken hold of her. <br />
 <br />
“Something wrong babe?” You ask, fully aware of what was to transpire. You listen as your girlfriend&#39;s laughter continued to escalate. <br />
<br />
 “Hee-hee-hee...I... don’t know...hya-hya-hya...I feel kinda... ah-ha-ha...funny...HAW-HAW-HAW” Dropping the phone, Christine rushed to the medicine cabinet in the bathroom, desperate for anything that can curb this strange case of the chuckles. But upon seeing her reflection she froze... <br />
<br />
What the hell was going on?! <br />
<br />
Her skin had turned completely white whilst a big red smile, outlined in black, covered her mouth. Small blue circles were situated on her cheeks while arching black lines rested above her now whitened eyebrows. Her eyelashes had grown to ridiculous levels while her nose seemed more...bulbous. Touching it, Christina watched as it popped like a balloon, leaving a big red orb in its wake.  The realization finally hit her... <br />
<br />
Was she...turning into a clown? <br />
<br />
Rather than resist, the young woman just stood there and watched, laughing as the mysterious metamorphosis continued. Her luscious blonde hair shifted into a ridiculous canary yellow while her plain red turtleneck now displayed rainbow stripes. A pair of white gloves materialized over her hands and her jeans were now a pair of blue polyester pants, fastened together tightly by bright yellow suspenders. Finally, her red chucks morphed into oversized clownish caricatures of their former selves. As she continued staring into the mirror, Christina began to take notice of various changes in her apartment. Her toilet was now bright red with white spots and her shower curtains were suddenly a collage of clowns and circuses. New memories also began to form inside her head. Christina merely smiled and closed her eyes, eagerly awaiting what was to come next...  <br />
<br />
Opening her eyes, the young woman found herself staring at her reflection in the bathroom. She was slightly confused.  <br />
<br />
“Golly! Did I zone out again?!” Her voice was noticeably high pitched though nothing about it struck her as odd, for she always had such a voice. Smacking herself for doing something so dumb, she took to the mirror to adjust her hair before taking the time to admire herself further. A magenta-colored beret now rested on her head and pinned to her striped top was a red button above her right breast. Spelled in white letters was the name... <br />
<br />
Mimmee the Clown <br />
<br />
That was her! She looked so silly and she loved every bit of it! The newly born Mimmee giggled as she returned to her living room. The once drab white walls and hardwood floors were now replaced with swirling colors and rainbow carpeting. Circus and carnival memorabilia were everywhere and every piece of furniture was “clownified” so to speak. Her award wall, which once showcased numerous accolades from high school and work was now merited to all her clowning achievements. Falling into her yellow smiley sofa, Mimmee picked up her oversized hot pink phone and discovered her boyfriend was still on the line. <br />
<br />
“Chrissy! Everything okay!” Mimmee laughed. <br />
“A-HYUCK! Ya pulling my leg again Butty-Boo? It’s Mimmee!” You honk your nose and just chuckle. <br />
“Hyuck, Hyuck! Guilty as charged Silly-Doodle! *honk* *honk* Just couldn’t resist getting a laugh outta my favorite gal!” Mimmee made a kissing sound before answering. <br />
“It’s what I luv about you, ya lug! *honk* *honk*” She then asks. “So, what did the circus say bout my resume? Does this gal have a new home?” You send her two honks, which usually meant yes. A big smile emerged on Mimmee’s already grinning face.  <br />
<br />
“You mean?!” <br />
“Yup! We finally found us a home Silly-Doodle! We start tomorrow morning!” Mimmee squeed, jumping up and down like a giddy little schoolgirl while letting out a bunch of “Yes’s”. Honking away without a care in the world, Mimmee exclaimed. “A-HYUCK! You DO know if you were here right now, I’d be planting a big wet one on ya?!” You just laugh. “Well gosh! Now that I know I wish I was!” A hunger now in her eyes, Mimmee asked: “Why wait? The circus ain’t far from my place! Why don’t I pick ya up and we spend the rest of the night here “celebrating”! Wink! Wink!” You sigh. “Tempting that maybe, we can’t at the moment.” Mimmee froze. <br />
<br />
Buttons was suddenly speaking in his “serious voice”!  <br />
<br />
“Just got a call from pops, said he wants to celebrate the occasion with dinner, his treat.” You pause “Thinking either Mcdonald’s or Country Kitchen Buffet. You in?” Mimmee went for her nose. <br />
“*honk* *honk* Yer darn right I am! I love your eating with your family and we always have a blast when we’re out on the town!”  <br />
“Awesome! But before we go...would you be in on a little...prank?”  <br />
“WHY ARE YOU EVEN ASKING!?” Mimmee exclaimed. “I LOOOOOVE pranks! You know that!”  <br />
“Yeah but it’s gonna be on...John and Ruthanne” Mimmee was confused. <br />
“Um...why?” You elaborate. ” There’re two more clown openings here and one of the head honchos gave me the means to do some...how should we say it? Conscriptions. Just make em laugh and they’ll become clowns like us! Don’tcha think the four of us would make an awesome team?” <br />
<br />
“ARE YOU JOKING BUTTY-BOO?!” She screamed in between her giggles. “Sounds like silly hocus pocus nonsense if you ask me! Hyuck, hyuck, hyuck!” You just smile in assurance before continuing. “Maybe yer right, Silly-Doodle but what&#39;s the harm in having some fun? You in?”  <br />
<br />
“Course I &#39;am! *honk* *honk*” Mimmee exclaimed. “Ya got me into a circus after all! Anything for my hero of the hour!” <br />
<br />
“Okay swing by and I’ll fill ya in on the details...”</p>
