<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As another soft gong echoes throughout the common area; all of the council weres groan as they once again head to the chamber. Lance sighing as he gets up, looks at Eric and Frieda; “hopefully this will be quick.” Getting up to also head to the chamber he watches Brett Smithson return to the position usually reserved for the accused. The accused being Julie Stovall, as this is the trial for the second statue 1A* charge she was going to face. Knowing that Brett faces an uphill battle in defending her client; a client that just an hour prior escaped the council building the skulk minders watching her, by committing a murder and using the deceased person’s clothes as a disguise.<br />
<br />
Tachibana seeing everyone present, raises her paws in the air requesting silence as she is about to speak.<br />
“Despite the tragedy that has befallen our hallowed halls,” Tachibana beginning; “we still have a trial to conclude. While the defendant has chosen to run off before facing her judgement, this council will still continue. We will continue by declaring this a trial by absentia!**” Tachibana stares at Brett Smithson; a were badger who looks crestfallen. Her defendant in more trouble than she could hope to save her from; Brett steels herself for what could be her finest hour or embarrassing defeat.<br />
<br />
“We begin like before,” Tachibana booming; “by reviewing the evidence gathered. Please roll the security footage displaying the incident that took place Tuesday of last week in the lunch of Moon Lake High!”<br />
<br />
As the footage plays; the council once again is treated to a video without sound. Seeing Julie Stovall approaching both, Eric and Frieda and seconds later lunge at Eric. Most do not pick up on the part where Eric manages to overpower Julie with ease, but Brett Smithson does. Seconds later Frieda was restraining her as the teachers who were nearby leaped into action to remove Julie from the cafeteria.<br />
Tachibana requesting the surveillance footage to stop playing speaks; “I call Frieda Kni-“<br />
“No,” Brett interrupts, “I request Eric Anderson to be called forth first.”<br />
“This is highly irregular,” Tachibana staring at Brett.<br />
“This whole kangaroo court is irregular,” Brett glares; “but since I am forced to play by its rules, I will call who I want to question. I do have that right!”<br />
Tachibana stares at the were-badger; “yes you do. Very well, bring forth Eric Anderson.”<br />
<br />
Moments later, Eric is broth forth to the podium he was at earlier for the first half of the trial. Staring at the assembled council members; Eric waits for Tachibana to speak but instead its Brett Smithson asking the questions.<br />
“When we saw footage of you being accosted by my client earlier,” Brett asking; &quot;when she had her hand gripping your manhood. You could not escape her grasp. Yet,” Brett replaying the footage of Julie’s lunch time assault; “here you are making her eat floor as it were. Care to explain?”<br />
Eric thought for a moment; knowing that Brett is fishing for a possible out for her client, he recalls the Tuesday morning when Frieda took his cell phone to give her his number and scratching him unawares. Smiling because he realized of an out for her in not facing possible statue 1A charges herself Eric begins.<br />
<br />
“Frieda scratched me,” Eric answers but continuing before anyone could react; “by my request.”<br />
“You asked Frieda to scratch you?” Brett surprised with the answer Eric just gave; “please explain.”<br />
It would be better if I showed you,” Eric answering; “I know of a video clip between Julie Stovall and Brian Walker detailing an incident I, Frieda and Spencer as well as half the student body witnessed earlier in the morning.”<br />
“Very well,” Tachibana speaking up; “we will pause while you give the particulars to our tech.”<br />
<br />
Moments later as Eric shows the were-horse where on social media to look up a particular clip; happy that it has yet to be taken down. Heading to podium where everyone sees what could be described as a humiliating breakup scene at the school&#39;s drop of area.<br />
‘Julie: I was thinking of you.<br />
Brian: Bull. Just so it’s clear to you. It’s over between us.  Find someone else who is willing to allow you to polish their knob. It won’t be me anymore. Lose my number!’<br />
The last portion of the clip before ending shows Julie running off in tears as a large crowd of onlookers stare and snigger at her.<br />
<br />
“It was shortly after that incident,” Eric speaking; “that Frieda and I decided to accelerate the time table of me becoming a were-panther. We had planned to have me become one on Saturday; but with Julie clearly upset, I was worried she would try to make another attempt to turn me into a wer-mer, and with what happened during freshman lunch which we all just saw; I was right to be worried.”<br />
“Do you know who recorded and posted this,” Tachibana taking over the questioning.<br />
“No,” Eric answers; “but it was already trending at school well before lunch. I can’t say for certain Julie saw it on her social media account; but I wouldn’t be surprised if she saw it through a friends account.”<br />
“Very well,” Tachibana nodding; “that is all. Unless you have more questions for the victim;” Tachibana staring at Brett Smithson.”<br />
“No,” Brett looking like a she swallowed a tack.<br />
“Very well,” Tachibana speaking; “Eric Anderson you are excused. Thank you for your patience in this difficult matter, and congratulations on becoming the were species of your choice.”<br />
“Get Frieda Knight in hear,” Brett booms as Eric leaves.<br />
“NO,” Tachibana barking; “you as well as everyone else her saw the surveillance footage as well as the additional footage Eric provided, it was clear as the noses on our muzzles that your client initiated an unprovoked attack. An attack that both Eric and Frieda were in their right mind to defend themselves.<br />
“I’m not arguing that,” Brett growling; “I want Frieda to confirm what Eric just said.”<br />
“Confirm what Eric said,” Tachibana looking incredulous; “did you not see the footage?”<br />
“I’m not talking about the footage,” Brett answering; “I’m referring to Frieda agreeing to scratch Eric.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Eric back out on the common area; rushes towards Frieda and Spencer. Whispering so none but they can hear, Eric relates to them what just happened in the council chambers.<br />
“Shit Eric,” Spencer whispering; “Brett is trying to undermine yours and Frieda’s credibility.”<br />
“If she successfully argues to have you testify,” Eric looking at Frieda; “you need to confirm that you scratched me after seeing Brian dumping Julie and that you agreed to do it.”<br />
“Well,” Frieda whispering; “it is true, apart from you requesting it.”<br />
“We did plan to have me become a were-panther on Saturday,” Eric stating; “and since I agreed to the original plan…”<br />
“I think I get what Eric is getting at,” Spencer stating; “but to bend the truth in front of the council. In front of your uncle Frieda?”<br />
“It’s not as if it will get Julie off on the attempt to violate statue 1A,” Frieda thinking; “if it come to it, yes I’ll confirm what Eric said. If not, then either way we move on.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“I would like to remind the council,” Lance standing up; “that Frieda is also a victim in Julie’s attack towards Eric. To dare a question my niece’s honesty, the future were-panther rep…” Lance sitting down, letting that last portion sink in.<br />
Leon Talbot also standing up, “We also have the witness statements from the teacher’s and from both Eric and Frieda; I have read them and find they do not waiver in the altercation we viewed from the school footage.”<br />
“I believe we have seen and heard all that is needed,” Randolph the werewolf rep stating; “to render a verdict.”<br />
“All except for my client’s side,” Brett not liking where this is going.<br />
“Julie forfeited her right to be heard,” Andrew standing up; “the moment she murdered Debbie and escaped. Thanks to her,” Andrew fuming; “we had to issues a were-alert and call in the Luna brotherhood to hunt your client down!”<br />
“Agreed,” the were-horse rep shouting; “I motion for a vote!”<br />
“Silence,” Tachibana booming; “we will render a verdict in due time. Brett Smithson; other than wanting to speak to Frieda Knight, who else do you wish to call upon that you feel can help your client’s defense?”<br />
“Julie’s parents,” Brett grasping at straws; “I request, Martin and Melissa Stovall to testify before the council!”<br />
<br />
<br />
*Statute 1A is a crime in which a were does, without consent and/or with malice of forethought, force to attempt to change a normal against their will to the attacking were’s species. Regardless if they are successful of not, the penalty upon conviction is a minimum mandatory fifty year sentence for each charge convicted thereof.—Tachibana no Akane, from previous episode &quot;Opening Arguments&quot;.<br />
<br />
** Trial by Absentia is a criminal proceeding in a court of law in which the person who is subject to it is not physically present at those proceedings.</p>
