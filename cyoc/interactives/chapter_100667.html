<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So how was practice? &quot; said Gina with smile, as she lounged on her bed nibbling on some crackers.<br />
<br />
Jake glared angrily at Gina.  After school he could not find Gina, and was forced to attend practice in her place.  He didn&#39;t want to admit it, but the practice went well and he actually had fun.  He may not have had the skills of years of training, but the natural talents of Gina&#39;s body went a long way.  It wasn&#39;t just that he towered over the other girls.  Gina&#39;s reflexes and stamina were ideally suited for the game.  He knew he needed to practice more to get really good, but Coach Miller was very pleased with his efforts.  Instead of the bane he feared, practice was actually the highlight of his day.<br />
<br />
If only the rest of his day went so smoothly.  Gina had been right.  Jake had always wanted to be taller.  It was difficult being 5&#39;6&quot;.  But he found that being 6&#39;5&quot; was equally problematic.  Everything seemed too small.  The desks looked like they had been designed for children, and squeezed his large body.  He found himself constantly ducking to avoid running into things.  He had bumped his head more than once in a doorway.  And his neck ached from looking down at everyone so he could talk to them face to face.  But the worst had to be the constant staring.  Everyone was civil and courteous when he talked to them, but when he walked down the hallways he could feel the constant stares of the other kids as they ogled him.  He felt like an exhibit at a freak show.<br />
<br />
So he was eager to change back, and understandably upset when he couldn&#39;t find Gina after school.  After waiting almost an hour, he crammed himself into Gina&#39;s car and drove to his house, hoping to find her there.  He had an odd conversation with his Mom when she opened the door.  She didn&#39;t recognize him, of course, and Jake wondered if his Mom thought he was a girlfriend or something.  Who else would be asking to visit Jake?  When she told him that Jake wasn&#39;t home, Jake looked up Gina&#39;s address on her driver&#39;s license and headed to her home. And that was how he found her - laying on her bed in his body eating a light snack.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fine, &quot; said Jake shortly.  &quot;Where the hell were you?  I thought we were going to meet after school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it down! &quot; said Gina.  &quot;My little sister will be home any minute.  And I don&#39;t think it will be a good idea for her to find a boy in my room. She can be a real brat, and loves to tattle on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, &quot; said Jake quietly.  &quot;But you still owe me an explanation.  What have you been doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly what I said - researching the amulet.  I looked it up on the internet and I found out all about it.  It&#39;s called the Medallion of Zulo.  Listen to what it says about it on the internet, &quot; said Gina with excitement.<br />
<br />
 &#39;An old but shiny medallion. But this is no ordinary medallion; it has the power to change people, to alter their bodies in mysterious ways. While wearing the medallion, if a piece of clothing comes in contact with it the wearer will transform into the previous occupant of the clothing&#39;s body; be it human or animal. In the case of an unworn piece of clothing coming in contact with the medallion, the medallion will transform the wearer&#39;s body to the specifications of that piece of clothing. If two people touch it at the same time, their bodies will transform into each other.  The person changed will also find that they cannot be changed again until half a day. &#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!  So let&#39;s switch back, &quot; said Jake eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast.  You have to wait 12 hours before you can change again.  That&#39;s why I just chilled here and didn&#39;t bother to come get you after school.  There was really no point.  We would have still needed to wait around for several more hours before we could switch again anyway, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
Jake plopped down on the bed, sitting next to Gina.  &quot;Okay, so we changed during first period, maybe around eight o&#39;clock in the morning.  So that means we can change back around 8 PM.  What are we going to do until then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina rubbed his shoulders.  They were sore from practice, and the massage felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can think of a few things.  We do have a unique opportunity to have a little fun, &quot; said Gina with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? &quot; asked Jake, enjoying the massage as Gina worked her hands down his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... experiment a little,  &quot; said Gina, as she gently squeezed his ass.<br />
<br />
Jake jumped up off the bed.  &quot;What are you talking about?  Do you want have sex?  Like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina nodded eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way.  I am not gay!  I do no want to be violated.  Especially by my own body, &quot; said Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon.  It&#39;s not gay.  I am a woman, and you are a man.  Who cares who has what parts.  What matters is how you feel, and I can make you feel real good.  Trust me, I know that body real well, &quot; said Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sick, &quot; said Jake.  But he had to admit that he was also a little curious.  He had not been with a girl before, and now that he had the body of one he found himself aroused by his own body.  He had constantly fought the urge to try masturbating as a woman.  Suddenly, a thought occurred to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  You haven&#39;t been playing with yourself  .... I mean,  myself ...... I mean, my body have you? &quot; asked Jake.<br />
<br />
Gina smiled, and reached her hand into her pants.  &quot;Not yet.  But I have been tempted. Your dick is really hot, and it feels even better.  Do you want to help, or just to watch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake pulled her hand out of her pants.  &quot;Keep your hands to yourself, &quot; said Jake angrily.  &quot;We are just going to wait here and do nothing until we can change back and get everything back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina pouted, but complied with his demands.  &quot;Fine, we&#39;ll do it your way.  But you&#39;ll never know what you are missing, &quot; said Gina.  She sighed.  &quot;Man, I wish I had taken advantage of your body when I had the chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake glared at her again, and she held up her hands in mock surrender. She had been thinking about how to use the medallion for several hours, and had come up with a plan.  She would need Jake&#39;s help, but she wasn&#39;t quite sure he would be up for it.  He seemed a little too much of a prude.  She might need to leave him out of it, and implement her plan by herself.  Gina brooded over the problem in silence. <br />
<br />
Jake remained quiet, mulling over his own problems.  He knew should have been disgusted by Gina&#39;s offer, but the more he thought about it the more appealing it became.  He wondered what it would feel like to have something large and hard penetrate him, filling and stimulating his vagina as it was thrust inside and out.  He felt himself beginning to get aroused, and started to get worried.  Maybe having Gina&#39;s body also gave him some of her desires.  That would explain why she had Jake&#39;s strong sexual drive.  Jake tried to think of something else, but found his eyes slowly drifting back to the bulge in Gina&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
They both sat together in silence, quietly watching the minutes tick by on the clock.</p>
