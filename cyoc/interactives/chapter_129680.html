<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan stood there - staring at his new body.  His chin was above the top of the mirror- his chest pushed out on either side.  The frame just showed the expanse of his massive torso - the nipples close to the edges.  His gut dominated the image - large, round, full, and slightly overhanging his tight pants.  <br />
<br />
Bryan was conflicted.  His body was massive, his skin increasingly hair covered. He had a beard that brushed his massive neck.  His head was buzzed tight - the stubble just barely a quarter inch.  His mind said it was to keep him from sweating so much, that he did it every morning...but he remembered a different memory - one of getting a haircut about four weeks ago before school pictures. Now...he had a memory of him shaving his head daily - it grew too fast to do anyting good with it. <br />
<br />
His clothes were different too - more respectable.  A massive 3XL button down stripped shirt covered his upper body - and size 56x40 slacks covered his legs.  He peered as far over his gut as he could, but found his feet hidden from view - though he could feel (ad remember) putting on some size 20 dress shoes.  His pants were held up by some professional looking suspenders, giving him the overall appearance of a university student - or professor.<br />
<br />
Simon stood in awe, looking his massive friend up and down.  Bryan cleaned up nice, as a 16 year old, while Simon looked a bit rougher.  His clothes were a bit worn and freyed, his shirt tight fitting, but a size smaller - as if bought and not been able to be replaced.  He tugged on his shirt, exposing the red hairy mass of his belly.  His beard was slightly longer - his dad spending time (in this reality, his dad was gung-ho beards - coaching Simon on how to trim, to oil his beard, to brush and maintain it.  His beard looks great - especially for his age. <br />
<br />
However, he&#39;d wondered aloud what that puberty percentage had done - and now seeing Bryan - 4 inches taller than him at least - and much hairier - he wondered if there was something at work.<br />
<br />
Bryan turned around to his friends, rubbing his massive gut.  &quot;Hey...your dad have a scale?&quot; He asked, as he finished off the big bowl of cereal he&#39;d be scarfing down earlier.<br />
<br />
Simon nodded and pointed over to the laundry closet - where the &#39;Big Man&#39;s Scale&#39; was slide between the washer and dryer.  Bryan went over and got it out, feeling how light it felt - how light everything felt for some reason.   He set it down and stepped up on it.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...Jay - Simon?&quot; Bryan said, his voice a bit soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah - what is it?&quot; Jay said, a smirk on his stubbled face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Could you read it? I ... I can&#39;t quite see it&quot; Bryan said, his face blushing under his dark beard. <br />
<br />
Jay and Simon both went over - crossing in front, where they saw Bryan&#39;s substantial gut hanging over the scale...and about three inches further.  They sniggered, but in a way that had Bryan blushing with pride.  &quot;Dude...you&#39;re 407lbs...&quot; Simon said at last, and Bryan stepped back, his gut jiggling in one piece - like a solid beach ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;And...I&#39;m just 16?!&quot; Bryan grunted, grinning.<br />
<br />
They nodded as they looked at the Chronivac that Jay had left on the table.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So...what happens if we used it to become adults?&quot; Bryan asked, scratching his hairy gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably we&#39;d move into our own place...either go to college or get jobs...&quot; Simon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might work out more...do other things...&quot; Jay added, his mind thinking to his potential as  big QB.  He flexed his bicep, imagining being a famous sports star.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not try it?&quot; Bryan stated bluntly, and he swiped up the device.  He found what he looked for quite quickly - his mind picking up the interface much easier than his friends.  With a few simple clicks, a bright white light flashed from the device, and all three boys stepped back, covering their eyes.<br />
<br />
Jay felt odd, his body tingling as he staggered.  His chest felt heavier - his arms more and more snug in their skin-tight jersey.  The shirt changed becoming the state college jersey - with Jay&#39;s name across his back - and the number 12.   Jay&#39;s face grew more square, his neck thicker as he gained more muscle mass, passing 300lbs of brawny quarterback.  His hands grew out - his feet pushing to size 16.5 - making him a perfect man to run and throw the ball for dozens and dozens of yards.   He blinked over and over, as his mind grew memories of football - of tactics, strategies - of plays and players - coaches and assistants - all helping him win game after game.   A thick ring on his right hand announced his State All-Star win as a QB.   He now had a full-ride scholarship to State as their QB.  He rubbed his face, finding that his trademark mustache is thicker - bushing out almost a full inch, making him look much older than his 18 years.  He flexed an arm - and found a black ink mark wrapping itself around his biceps - both of them sporting a barbwire tattoo around the widest circumference.  &quot;Dude..I&#39;m inked!&quot; Jay said, his voice growing deeper, more commanding.  Years of football had given him an attitude of leadership, even if it was a bit overbearing at times.<br />
<br />
Bryan was riding an elevator - as his body expanded.   The scale disappeared again, as his belly grew out, his eyes looking at the door - and then the doorsill...and then the hanging thing above the door.  He looked up and saw he was a scant few inches from the ceiling of the 8&#39; tall ceiling.  He moved away from the fan - the blades now at eye level.  He felt his shirt shift - as his gut grew...and grew - his chest inflating with more beef.  &quot;oh...damn..&quot; he belched - his voice cracking as it passed into the deep baritones - nearing Basso Profundo.  His neck grew wider - thicker than even Jay&#39;s big bicep.  His hair grew thicker - his beard denser and heavier, the stubble reaching up to his upper cheek bones.   His head remained buzzed - his forehead showing a bit more than he expected...which he attributed to the odd angle.  Bryan had to bend almost in half to bring his head into view.    His pants felt so snug -too tight around the crotch.  The slacks shifted - and he felt a difference - as he started to wear a professional looking kilt - one that allowed his cock and balls to hang free.   Though, that turned into a mistake - as the fat head of his cock swung below the hemline of the kilt.  From what the Jay and Simon saw - Bryan&#39;s cock had to be over three inches wide.<br />
<br />
Simon started to speak, as he watched hair pour out of Bryan&#39;s tight collar, undershirt, and sleeves, but he found his voice caught, his neck starting to thicken.   His red hair grew faster - his beard, with the hard work that his dad and he put into it, grew thicker and denser - falling down his chest like a waterfall.  Soon it brushed his belt buckle - and Simon knew it was going to only grow longer.  His height stopped at 6&#39;5.5&quot; just a smidgeon taller than his dad, but his gut was a solid 65&quot; around - bigger than his dad&#39;s.  He was proud of the full mass, the ball belly that stretched out his shirt.  Speaking of, he looked down and watched his clothes changing.   His t-shirt became a button shirt - one with his name sewn in on the left hand side.  A bit of grease and oil splattered on his gut - as Simon&#39;s hands grew rough and firm.  He realized he didn&#39;t go to college - but was a mechanic at a garage in town.  He knew a ton about cars - about engines - and had been working at this shop since he turned 16.  The summer job experience had given him a taste of it, and he&#39;d enjoyed it.  He looked over at his friends, as his pants turned into a set of coveralls that his button-shirt hung over.  &quot;Whoa...This is weird&quot; he said, as the other two stared at him, their eyes wide open.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; He asked, as he smacked his lips, tasting an odd, pungent taste on his tongue.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Simon...where&#39;d you get that?&quot; Jay asked, staring at Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get what?&quot; he asked as a cloud-like phantom passed before his eyes.  &quot;What is that...smoke?&quot; he asked, and both Jay and Bryan nodded.  Simon looked at his right hand - and a cigar - a lit cigar - was gripped firmly between his two fingers - the hold his dad had taught him at 17.  He blinked, it was his cigar...and Simon was smoking them.  His mind turned faster - as new memories of a cigar smoking dad filled his mind, working with him on cars since he was 14 - building engines - talking shop.   He was just following in his dad&#39;s footsteps - a big burly cigar smoking car mechanic.<br />
<br />
Simon returned the cigar to his mouth, holding it to one side and speaking around it.  &quot;Damn....that thing is too powerful&quot; He said, pointing a free finger to the device on the counter.  <br />
<br />
Bryan pulled on a pair of thick black rim glasses, as he thought about what to do.  His button shirt was straining - as had almost all shirts he&#39;d worn.  6XL was the current size - and already they were getting snug.  His 8XL suspenders held up his pants as he walked around, his massive feet making the room rumble softly.  &quot;Yeah...it&#39;s rewriting reality...making us into different men.&quot; He added.  <br />
<br />
Jay rubbed his dense &#39;stache.  &quot;The only question - do we undo this ....or do we do something else?&quot;</p>
