<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Lyon might have been a gentleman, and James a gentleman’s butler, but even they had their limits. And the thick scent of wine, cigar smoke, and musk-soaked menswear pushed each man far, far beyond that limit. James’s soft, pink, and slightly wrinkled hedgehog paws caressed the muscular lion’s legs through his silk trousers, legs so thick and powerful that his trousers looked like they were painted onto him. Lyon ran one paw across the hedgehog’s muzzle, tracing the long length of his conical snout and teasing James’s long and sweeping whiskers, while the other firmly gripped James’s pert rear end just below his tail, pulling him closer and closer until their hard bulges were throbbing against one another.<br />
<br />
	“...Now James… As a man of the law, I must ask… Do I have your <i>consent</i>?” Lyon growled amorously, his moist, port-scented breath tickling the fur on James’s ears.<br />
<br />
	“All that and more, sir,” James breathed eagerly, practically falling into the red-maned lion’s arms. He could only marvel at <i>how</i> such a perfect man could exist. No, not simply perfect. Perfect for him and him alone. The encapsulation of everything he found most desirable in a man; refined, handsome, and oh-so-muscular, but with a wild and sexual side hiding just barely under the surface.<br />
<br />
	“The second floor guest rooms. Farthest door on the left,” James whispered, reaching into his breast pocket and removing a set of silver keys that he jingled playfully in front of Lyon’s nose.<br />
<br />
	“As you wish, my dear,” Lyon murmured, nibbling at James’s ear before hefting him up in his powerful arms and hurrying out of the smoking room as quick as he could, his tufted tail waving eagerly behind him. After all, it simply wouldn’t be <i>proper</i> if the ladies of the house stumbled upon what he and James were about to do, would it?<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Like the rest of Benjamin’s family’s estate, the guest rooms were the peak of luxury, each one with a king-sized four-poster bed decked out in silk sheets and down-stuffed pillows, antique furniture, and massive windows that looked out upon the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Lyon gently deposited the squirming hedgehog on the bed before plucking the set of keys from James’s paw and locking the bedroom door with a dramatic <i>click</i>. The sound made James’s spines stand on end, while his erection was now threatening to split his trousers down the middle with its insistence to be let free.<br />
<br />
“Well, now that we won’t be disturbed…” he purred, his deep voice rumbling in his throat as he carefully removed his suit jacket and hung it over a nearby chair. Slowly, teasingly, James loosened his tie and undid the buttons down the front of his shirt, letting more and more of his luxurious chest fur be shown, along with a warm cloud of all the steamy musk that had been building up beneath the lion’s clothes.<br />
<br />
James felt a spurt of precum spatter against the insides of his trousers as the scent hit his sensitive nose. His breath coming in heavy gasps, he reached up to remove his bow-tie and jacket, and his strict butler training made it second nature for him to carefully fold them and set them off to the side to avoid any unwanted wrinkles. Or stains. But when he began to unbutton his own shirt, Lyon stepped nearer and held James’s paws firmly as he leered down at him with his sharp teeth glinting in the light.<br />
<br />
“No, no. Let <i>me</i> handle that,” Lyon purred once more. His weight fell on the bed next to James and he quickly pinned the hedgehog down against the luxurious silk sheets before leaning his muzzle forward and delicately undoing each button down the front of James’s shirt with his lips, inhaling deep lungfuls of the hedgehog’s scent with every breath. When the last button sprang open, Lyon let out a wild growl before biting down on the hedgehog’s silk collar and pulling the entire shirt off James’s back with his mouth.<br />
<br />
“And now for the main course…” Lyon murmured quietly as he undid James’s belt and tugged his trousers down past his knees, letting James’s narrow, throbbing rod out into the fresh air for the first time. For a short moment, James was a bit confused at its appearance, having expected something thicker, longer, and more pointed, not the skinny, flat-tipped thing, but the more he looked at it, the more he knew it was most definitely his. That’s just what a <i>proper</i> hedgehog nob looks like, isn’t it?<br />
<br />
Not that he even <i>had</i> much time to look at it, thanks to Lyon’s eagerness. The thickly-muscled lion ran his tongue up its length a few times with his rough, feline tongue, and James could feel each little barb on the lion’s rough tongue tugging and scraping maddeningly at his sensitive skin. In no time at all, a steady stream of sweet precum moistened Lyon’s snout, driving him positively mad with lust. With renewed energy, Lyon dragged his tongue over every inch of James’s fuzzy crotch, starting just beneath his quivering tailhole until he finally reached the dribbling tip.<br />
<br />
James, every the proper butler, knew he couldn’t just sit back and let Lyon do all the work. No, no, he was a servant at heart, and he needed to <i>serve</i> this sexy beast of a gentleman. Shifting his position in the bed, he slowly moved into a sixty-nine position while Lyon continued to lap tenderly at his cock, taking a deep breath of the warm and heady musk seeping out from under Lyon’s tented trousers. Slowly but confidently, he unbuckled Lyon’s leather belt and unbuttoned the fly, and with practically no coaxing whatsoever the lion’s fat, red, and pointed feline malehood flopped right out and bopped James right on the snout, leaving a damp spot of pre smearing into his otherwise immaculate fur.<br />
<br />
James licked his lips eagerly before stretching his mouth wide and took the entire length into his mouth, the intense taste of lion sweat dancing over his tongue. <i>&#39;That wine had nothing on this, I daresay&#39;</i>, the blissful hedgehog thought dreamily as he lapped at the salty nectar spurting from Lyon’s cock, which despite its length seemed to fit perfectly into James’s long and pointed muzzle. Lyon, taking a cue from his hedgehog lover, did the same and enveloped James’s cock in his hot and moist muzzle, sucking loudly and sending waves of pleasure up and down James’s spine from the tips of his twitching ears to the end of his tail.<br />
<br />
Lyon’s rough and wet tongue soon brought James close to the peak of pleasure before teasingly backing away, eliciting quiet squeaks and grunts from the rutting hedgehog. Likewise, James’s thin and flexible tongue wrapped and twisted around James’s barbed manhood like a vice, squeezing and coaxing pure bliss from the purring feline. The tip of James’s tongue flicked against the fleshy bumps dotting the length of Lyon’s cock, and after what felt like an eternity of sucking and moaning, each man finally let out a bestial growl as they simultaneously released a torrent of hot, thick, and salty cum into one another’s eager muzzles. James held his prize upon his tongue for a moment, savouring the flavor like a fine brandy before slowly letting the thick fluid trickle down his throat to settle in his belly.<br />
<br />
Letting their cocks finally drop from each other’s lips, the two men repositioned themselves in the bed and rested their heads upon the luxuriously soft pillows. The silk sheets were a mess, completely disheveled and damp with sweat and semen, and the entire room stuck of hot male sex. But, James knew that there was a set of spare sheets ready to go for just such an occasion, and after a bit of airing out the room would be (more-or-less) as good as new.<br />
<br />
Lyon chuckled and reached over to the antique bedstand next to the bed and opened a drawer, withdrawing yet another fine Cuban cigar and lighting it. Taking a puff into his lungs, he leaned over and planted a deep kiss on James’s lips, thick smoke and musky cum swapping between their mouths in the afterglow of their passionate lovemaking. The wild, sexual look in Lyon’s eyes slowly faded away with each puff, and the dignified lion gentleman once again reasserted itself in his posture and demeanor as he relaxed. That was truly was set James’s heart aflutter about this handsome lion; the knowledge that at a drop of a hat, this calm and poised man of culture might have him pinned against the wall and begging for another taste of his thick cock.<br />
<br />
But, for now, that switch was firmly in the ‘<i>off</i>’ position as the two men dozed in the heady haze of the musky guest room.<br />
<br />
<i>‘I daresay, if I had a bit of help around here, I’d have a tad more time to spend with my darling Lyon…’</i> James mused idly as pressed his snout into the soft and fragrant fur under Lyon’s muscular arms, already imagining the sort of person that might fill that role…</p>
