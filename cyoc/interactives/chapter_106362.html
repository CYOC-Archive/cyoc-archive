<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dude, have you seen my...?&quot; Justin halted mid-question as he heard the words come out of his mouth. Why did his voice sound so deep? He cleared his throat and tried again. &quot;Dude...&quot; Still weirdly low. <br />
<br />
Justin became aware that Zebulon was staring at him open-mouthed, clutching an old book in his lap. Why was Zebulon looking so freaked out? &quot;The fuck&#39;s wrong with you,&quot; Justin asked, but Zebulon remained tongue-tied.<br />
<br />
Justin shrugged and heard a loud rip. He glanced down and noticed that the seam of his t-shirt from his neck to his shoulder had split open. Only then did he notice the massive physical changes to his body. He walked toward the mirror over his dresser and gasped at what he saw. Some totally ripped, ridiculously handsome guy was staring back at him. He raised a hand to his face, pinching his skin to make sure what he was seeing was real. &quot;Are you seeing this shit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Zebulon spoke meekly. &quot;You been working out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin turned around slowly, his piercing blue eyes peering through narrowed lids, his massive new body looming menacingly over Zebulon. &quot;Don&#39;t fuck with me, Z. You know damn well I didn&#39;t look like this a minute ago.&quot; He noticed that the old book was no longer in Zebulon&#39;s lap and spotted something bulky tucked underneath Zebulon&#39;s pillow. Justin made a swift move toward Zebulon&#39;s bed and grabbed the book. Zebulon leapt toward it and tried to pull the book away, but he was woefully outmatched by Justin&#39;s newly acquired strength. <br />
<br />
Justin walked to his side of the room and sat down on his bed with a thud, the springs whining in complaint at his weight. He flung open the book and flipped through its brittle yellowed pages, baffled by the strange wording and grotesque woodcut illustrations. &quot;What the hell is this? Some ancient gay voodoo shit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trembling, Zebulon stayed on his side of the room. &quot;It&#39;s a book of spells I got out of the library.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you just figured you&#39;d put a spell on your idiot roommate?&quot; Justin sounded furious as he slammed the book shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I just thought I&#39;d try it. I mean, it&#39;s not like I thought it would actually work!&quot; Zebulon grinned weakly. &quot;If it&#39;s any consolation...you look really hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
That calmed Justin&#39;s rage a bit. He stood up and swaggered back to the mirror to check himself out. As curses go, it was hard to bitch about this one. He had suddenly gone from a scrawny non-entity to someone who would command instant attention just by walking into a room. He hoisted his beefy arms and flexed his biceps, further straining the fabric of his shirt. He gripped the collar of his shirt in his thick fingers and yanked, shredding the cotton and revealing broad pecs and carved abs coated with a newly grown carpet of soft brown hair. He felt his cock straining inside his too-tight jeans and reached down to relieve the pressure, but when his fingers were too clumsy to undo the pants button, he pulled at the waistline and burst the denim. He was amazed by the size of the bulge in his white briefs and pulled them down to get a look at his altered cock. An eight-inch purple beast sprung out and started to grow even longer, thicker and harder now that it was out of its prison. <br />
<br />
A throaty chuckle emerged from deep within Justin as he looked down at his incredible body. &quot;So, what was the idea exactly? Turn me into your fuckin&#39; gay wet dream?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-n-no. Honest,&quot; Zebulon stammered. &quot;I just thought you could use a little meat on your bones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh-heh. I got some meat all right,&quot; Justin said with a sneer as he wrapped his hand around the shaft of his throbbing purple cock. He felt a strong urge to start jerking himself off, but he paused and gave Zebulon a sidelong look. &quot;You&#39;d probably love to watch me jack this thing, wouldn&#39;t ya?&quot; <br />
<br />
Zebulon shook his head and gulped out a quick &quot;No&quot;, even though his true answer was yes. He&#39;d honestly love to do nothing for the next month but stare at his new and improved roommate, having created a masculine specimen that even surpassed his crush Xavier. But something about Justin&#39;s attitude suggested to Zebulon that he wasn&#39;t about to become his gay roommate&#39;s personal full-time Magic Mike. The spell had seemingly replaced Justin&#39;s easygoing personality with menace and cockiness, or maybe that just came automatically with having such an awesome body. <br />
<br />
Keeping one hand on his dick, Justin rubbed the other across his chest and abs. &quot;So how long &#39;til this wears off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zebulon bit his lip and admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t exactly know. I hadn&#39;t really thought that far ahead.&quot; He cautiously crossed the room to retrieve the book and searched frantically for the page that contained the curse. &quot;But don&#39;t worry, I will figure out a way to undo this just as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin stood in his tattered clothes, fixated on his reflection in the mirror. He smiled, exposing a brilliantly white set of teeth. &quot;Who said I want you to undo it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zebulon looked up in surprise. &quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the best fuckin&#39; thing that&#39;s ever happened to me. Why would I go back?&quot; <br />
<br />
Zebulon relaxed slightly, relieved that he didn&#39;t have to worry about his hulking roommate clobbering him for what he&#39;d done. He found the page with the curse and studied it carefully. &quot;Well, I&#39;m not the greatest at Old English but, as far as I can tell, the spell is permanent. Looks like I could make further alterations, though...if there&#39;s anything you want to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin stroked the stubble on his chin. So far, he&#39;d seen nothing to complain about. &quot;I&#39;ll have to think about that.&quot; He glanced at his closet full of medium t-shirts and skinny-legged jeans, knowing he would never fit in them again. &quot;Hey, can that book whip up some clothes for me? Can&#39;t go walkin&#39; around campus with my big old cock floppin&#39; around.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;d be fine by me, Zebulon thought but didn&#39;t dare say out loud. Justin grabbed a towel and wrapped it around his waist, then plunked himself down on his bed, looking across the room at Zebulon. Justin&#39;s legs were spread wide, so Zebulon could still see Justin&#39;s enormous hard-on bobbing inside the towel. He fought the urge to stare as he searched the book for a clothing spell. After a few minutes, he shouted, &quot;Aha! Found one.&quot; He instructed Justin to stand up and cautiously read the spell.<br />
<br />
Justin felt an odd sensation around his body, as if invisible forces were wrapping tightly against his skin. He started feeling claustrophobic as a strange glow surrounded him and fabric began to materialize around his torso and legs. Justin and Zebulon both held their breath and watched with astonishment as an entire outfit formed on Justin&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the glow faded, revealing a green tunic and tights with black boots. Justin looked like he&#39;d just arrived from a Renaissance Fair. &quot;What in the fuck is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zebulon winced apologetically as he struggled to figure out what happened. &quot;I think maybe the spell can only create the clothes from the era that the spell was written.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I ain&#39;t walking around dressed like Peter fuckin&#39; Pan!&quot;, Justin declared as he tried to figure out how to get out of the tunic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Zebulon assured him. &quot;This is my fault. I&#39;ll take care of buying you a whole new wardrobe tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow? Fuck that. I want to try this body out tonight.&quot;</p>
