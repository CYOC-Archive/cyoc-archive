<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You fags wish you could slide into my hole~Only true men can truly appreciate my gorgeous hole...unlike those wannabe dykes!”<br />
<br />
“OH MI GAWD GIRLFRIENDS LIKE! HOMOPHOBE ALERT!”<br />
<br />
Raymond Koh, the gay asian soccer Twink and his caucasian ‘girlfriends’, Layla, Shauna and Paula, giggled on video chat as they mocked at the newest, homophobic viral video they have seen. The Woke Women and Gay Twink, part of the school’s soccer team, who were once Erin’s greatest supporters, were now Erika Erotica’s enemies as they laughed at her.<br />
<br />
“So uncool...”<br />
“How unruly...”<br />
“What a bitch!”<br />
<br />
“I know right!” Raymond responded, as he sassily swished his finger back and forth, the asian soccer boi always found it funny with all these homophobes...”Never understood them and never will, especially my hot cous Raiden!”<br />
<br />
“Aw come on!”<br />
“He’s sorta your type though...”<br />
“Yeah...all those muscles!”<br />
<br />
“Nah...dedicated to my man Shane...” Raymond flexed his arm, letting it swell slightly as he gave a smirk to the girls, arms much larger than before as they took on a slighter pinkish hue blending well with the yellow-as though essence of caucasian surfaced in the man. “Livin’ together, stayin’ together”<br />
<br />
The ladies in the screen were not spared, each of them shifting to different shades of hue, one becoming that of orientals, one darkening to caramel brown and the other darkening pure black.<br />
<br />
“Oh mi gawd!”<br />
“Him?”<br />
“Really him?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah him!” The soccer jock flexed even harder, realizing and acknowledging the curling up biceps he now posses, intentionally pulling them up on screen as he stood up and moved away from the monitor, giving the ladies a full view of his size. “He’s my gamer bud after all!”<br />
<br />
As he flexed a couple of bicep curls, he could feel his soccer jersey shredding against those killer biceps of his, clenching those fists massively as they tightened and elongate rougher and larger as though they definitely have been lifting weights, pulling up as his thumbprints recode themselves into those of an avid gamer...or possibly someone who went pro as those skinny but nimble soccer arms became-<br />
<br />
BONK!<br />
<br />
“Oh Gosh dingus dammit!” Remarked, in a more childish but masculine tone as his back, which straightened up and pushed far apart as his shoulders hammed up with that gorgeous hue he now possessed. <br />
<br />
His back was simply not spared, as it rubbed up and down the metallic object he had hit, rubbing it up and down relentlessly-though more of a man’s shamelessness than a twink’s overconfidence. <br />
<br />
His palms open wide, big and strong as though those hands were made for catching balls than manicures as those nails were cleaned wide. Gripping the long metallic object behind, hardware speeding up like his comp as the resolution and software was of that of a MOBA player, as the former rose gold shifted into a Gamerware black and dark green.<br />
<br />
As he moved up and down, gripping the long thin metallic pole, his back loved it-as those trapezoids of his swelled greatly to his more confident-muscular posture-one that clearly spent hours working at the gym as his spinal chord pushed down his waist, the swell and more ripped version of his back pushed tightly against his soccer attire, which tightened into just a tee shirt, a slight hump at each of his traps-accentuating against his broad shoulders and back-simply indicating that this guy clearly worked hard on his physique.<br />
<br />
“What can I tell ya? Im attracted to the pole ladies~”<br />
<br />
The trio of girls giggled, as their woke equipment started to girlify apart, pushing aside-those joined beds into their individual sections as their comp became a bright pink. Giggling at the off handed flirt even though moments earlier they would pinch their nose in disgust towards any hint of heterosexuality.<br />
<br />
As soon as he hard that soft giggle, that small package of his tented...though it was just the thought of gaming with Shane right? As his buttocks rubbed up and down the shiny rod side of the pole, almost like a natural instinct as though he definitely had lessons on those.<br />
<br />
Cheeks against the pole, his bubble butt inflated as it pushed the twink forward-away from the cold hardness of the pole as though it repelled from any innuendo activity that does not come across as ‘hot’, and boy! <br />
<br />
“Is it HOT in here or is it just me?”<br />
<br />
“Just you~”<br />
“You’re hot~”<br />
“Oh mi gawd!”<br />
<br />
As soon as he heard that response, his grin widened even larger-why he never thought of video chatting these babes sooner! Specially since they know how to appreciate the real deal! And he KNOWS he to appreciate fine girls when he sees em.<br />
<br />
As soon as their sexualities connect,  They began groping their chests, moving backwards against the comp like their male friend as three poles began emerging behind. He could have sworn those breasts were not double D’s before.<br />
<br />
BUT THEY SURE ARE NOW!<br />
<br />
As Raymond followed in pursuit, widescreen as he groped his own chest in response, feeling tough-hardened muscle filling in as the meat as ripe and chewy, football was more of his alley, pectorals pushing tight against the darkening black, gamer shirt of his as they gave the former soccer boy preferred real men games from the states of America, round huge and firm as he groped it like it was the end of tomorrow, specially with this heat!<br />
<br />
“SO HOT!” He bellowed, lacking of any fairy slang as the intense heat melted the beta in his vocal chords. Gruesome to those of a loud, boisterous gamer as his neck was a far cry from gay, as his large Adam’s apple sat clearly in its place, the mixed American Asian clearly had no reservations as it was clear he was no femme.<br />
<br />
“So hawt~”<br />
“I know right~”<br />
“Teehee~”<br />
<br />
With that notion, the three of them tossed out their old tops, which became lacy cheerleader outfits as they revealed their slender hourglass figures, supporting their super model breasts in display as their bras were black, brown and yellow, supporting their new race as ‘cheerleaders’<br />
<br />
The gamer jock was clearly gobsmacked, his grin widened like it was his best prize, eyes narrowing-showing clear interest in the opposite gender as his dick betrayed his former desires-who the fuck wants to game with a noob like Shane?<br />
<br />
Lifting up his black gamer shirt-the frontal patterns forming a large flaming S as he hurriedly tossed aside to the pile of clothing that emerged from the living room. Pictures of loving photographs shifting to pictures of hot babes as cheap apartment equipment grew sizes into green screens and cameras, with one just turning on next to the computer of his.<br />
<br />
Making sure to record the very hot scene that is currently taking place.<br />
<br />
And that was not the only thing that was turned on. As the shirt was tossed aside, abdominals glistening in sweat as a radiance emerged from around the man like his body was of that of a God’s. Arrogance and sexiness emerged inside out as the treasure trail of his true descent made its way to-<br />
<br />
“Y’ALL CAN’T SAY I AINT READEH!”<br />
<br />
With that notion, an outburst of neanderthal strength surged upward, spreading his cheeks wide as those goddamn thighs rivalled Adonis’...he was definitely taller than his twunk of a roommate....who the fuck was he again?<br />
<br />
With an enormous pitched tent below, as a light puff of asian dark brown hair puffed at his pits and crotch, soccer shorts stretched wide and compressing against his thighs, merging with that former tidy whites which belonged to a gay twink as it dirtied the former combo into a pair of boxers.<br />
<br />
Blazed red with unique S-patterns decorated around it, specially a large one that’s centred in the middle. Flushed, as those tanned balls hung low, in submission to the new form of heterosexuality taking root, as his growing 8 inch weinner bowed down to whatever these goddesses wanted from him. <br />
<br />
“Show me your moves gamer boy~”<br />
“Rub on it hard~”<br />
“Do it fine ooh~”<br />
<br />
Spreading those calves wide apart, squinting those eyes of his, pressing his package widely against the metallic rod as his strong meaty palms pulled him up and down like a strong jungle man, effortlessly as his former self would have complained in an instant.<br />
<br />
Legs spread, already strong from soccer-developing pure rawness as they grew thrice the size as though every ounce of masculinity can now be seen on camera, effortlessly performing that stripper pole trick as the soles of his feet decided to harden like a football, sores putting muscle as they qualify for a quarterback’s shoes now, wiggling childishly as the man was almost indistinguishable from one of those brutes that scored a-<br />
<br />
“TOUCHDOWN!” He gestured, putting one of his gigantic palms down while supporting the rest of his in ease, those lessons from his stripper bro, Dan, really paid off. He was going to score enough with these chicks for Erika Erotica to-<br />
<br />
“Hey there, my sexy shooter~”<br />
<br />
In an instant, Erika Erotica’s crew, dressed in skimpy attire, giggled away as they let their boss take hold. Lin, Sierra and Paulina were pleased and satisfied with the Asian American’s demonstration of masculinity.<br />
<br />
“Whoa Babe!” The Gamer instantly paused, swirls in his eyes towards the hypnotic erotic trance, his jaw dropped-literally as it became squared around the edges-almost like a rectangular cleft.<br />
<br />
“Definitely straight...” She remarked. “Only real men would drool at the sight of my bod....not like those fags.”<br />
<br />
With that notion, the heterosexual gamer’s face swelled like a lemon, clenching his unpierced buttocks as though a self-defence mechanism towards any faggot, thrusting his member harder like a top-except it was reserved for ladies only.<br />
<br />
“WHAT ME? FAG? NU-UH!” The Asian-American spoke, hammily and dumbly as though completely entranced by the babe in the screen. “100% RAW AND STRAIGHT!”<br />
<br />
With exaggerated mouth movements, dusting over and under his lips were faint intricate-Korean traces of a real asian-while mixed with the aftershave and patterns of an American caucasian just like PA! And PA raised him up to be a REAL MAN-<br />
<br />
“GOD GUTS AND GUNS!” He gestured, flaring his lips and giving the youtube sensation a bright-flashing grin. Flexing his solid biceps, his nose and un-pierced ears complimented his chiseled jaw, next to those sexy beetle brows of his. <br />
<br />
“Definitely straight...definitely sexy...” Erika Erotica seductively spoke, tracing over her lips as she pronounced the final word. Raymond could only watch his raven black hair FLOOF! into a slightly lighter, dark brown esque tousled top with the front sticking up and out, ready to burst as it aimed-<br />
<br />
“Definitely a shooter~”<br />
<br />
FIRE!-E!-E!-E!<br />
<br />
With that command, DariusShooter let out a wild Howwwwwwl at his camera. Letting loose his former gay soccer player ways as football was more up his alley-his gamer jock, straightuber bud Raiden is already doing a great job in his team...but DARIUS GOTTA REMAIN AS ALPHA NUMBER 1! <br />
<br />
Alternating between keeping the school’s team STRAIGHT N FUCKIN’ as well as managing his incredible straightuber career-specially when he has gotten the attention of the voluptuous beauty that is Erika Erotica-<br />
<br />
“On my way big boy~Keep the bed pole straight will ya hun~”<br />
“Duh...uh huh! Anything for you babe~” <br />
<br />
Grinning dumbly beneath those dark brown thin eyes of his, sliding on a pair of gamer specs as he proudly leaped onto the couch-fully satisfied and ready for the boss.<br />
<br />
And this time, his aim will not miss.</p>
