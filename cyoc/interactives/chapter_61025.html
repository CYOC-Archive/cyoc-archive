<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>I made my way to the woods before pressing the ruby to take me back to the Nexus. "Welcome back," Ansley said behind me 
causing me to spin around. "You gave Jaundoco quite the scare. Ansley approves."</p>
<p>"I was told you could help me locate someone," I said really looking at him for the first time. He didn't look like a homeless person 
but like a lawyer.</p>
<p>"Ansley knows who seeks you," Ansley said then shook his head. "That's not right. Ansley knows who you seek. You follow Ansley 
and he will show you."</p>
<p>Ansley seemed to be a little crazy but I followed him anyway. He led me deeper into the woods and before long we came to a tent. 
I thought it was strange that Ansley would lead me here but I went ahead and went into the tent with him. If he tried anything I could get 
out of the Nexus and transform into something to fight him. As I entered the tent I saw that it was bigger on the inside than it was on the 
outside. "What is this?" I asked looking around.</p>
<p>"This be Ansley's home," Ansley said. "You need to listen to Ansley. There's much time." He sat down and shook his head saying, 
"Not right. There's not much time. You have been told that you are not who you think you are?" When I nod my head he continues, 
"Then you know that you were erased but a part remained. Have you heard the prophecy?" After another nod from me he continued, 
"Good. Ansley don't have to waste time with that. What you need to know is that you have been a few steps behind the one you seek 
for awhile and he/she has gone back to the word-slinger's world. If you want to find him/her you must go back to the word-slinger's 
world through the mirror."</p>
<p>"Why can't I just go there through the Nexus?" I asked. I didn't see why I needed to use a mirror to go to the word-slinger's world.
</p>
<p>"You just do," Ansley said with a smile. "Trust Ansley. He knows what he's doing. Now do you wish to try to go through the mirror? 
If not another way may be found."</p>
<p>I looked at the mirror with curiosity. There were no reflections in it. "Did James go through it?" I asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p>"He did and he didn't," Ansley said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Is that because he's like me?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Very good," Ansley said chuckling. "James was erased and became Sean who went through the mirror. Will you go through?"</p>
<p>Thinking about it I asked, "What about my family?"</p>
<p>"They will still be here when you come back as you must," Ansley said. "Ansley does not know how you get back but Heather does. 
You must also find an item related to Beth Milansky and bring it back."</p>
<p>"I'll go through then," I said nodding.</p>
<p>"A couple other things," Ansley said. "Once you find the item you, Sean, and Heather will be in danger until you return. Also magic 
isn't supposed to be in the word-slinger's world but it went through with Heather so it's there now."</p>
<p>"Ok," I said as I walked up to the mirror. Staring at it's non-reflective surface I took a deep breath and stepped through.</p>
<p>I was in blackness feeling myself being pulled and twisted every which way. I didn't know how long I was in this void but it was 
broken by the sound of a book falling.</p>
<p>The world came back into focus and I realized that I was staring at a computer screen with a hypnotic swirl on a flashing red and 
green background. I quickly close that out and see that I have a couple of tabs open. One is to Google docs which I was on now and 
the other was CYOC.net. I rubbed my eyes a bit and think, "<I>Don't be ridiculous Frank. You were just hypnotized and thought you 
had been transformed into a girl. That can't happen but I wish it could. My therapist says that it's just because Mom named me Franklin 
Eleanor Riggs but I still wish I could be transformed into a girl</I>." With a sigh I save the chapter I was writing and sign out of Google. 
I made sure to clear the history, cookies, and cache before leaving the computer. I hated coming here to read my favorite site and to 
write but my Internet at home was down. I was afraid of what someone would do if they found out about what I felt. I'm 36 and I saw 
what happened to people like me when they were found out.</p>
<p>As I left the campus library I thought about what my sister had planned for tonight. I was going out as Eleanor in public for the first 
time. I still remembered when Justine had dressed me the first time. She was having a slumber party and she insisted that I come too 
but dressed as a girl. She introduced me to her friends as her sister Eleanor and when asked why they didn't see me in school she told 
them that I went to a special school. Of course they Didn't ask where I was. What girl would ask where an annoying boy was as long as 
he didn't crash the party? During the party I had accidentally walked in on Jennifer while she was changing in the bathroom. She had 
almost screamed but then told me to hurry up and come in before I came by and, since I did not want her to find out that it was me, I 
went in and shut the door. I saw her almost totally naked while I was in there. She was just starting to develop breasts and I gave a 
little sigh. She told me not to worry. That my breasts would start growing soon. I believe that it was that night that I started wishing that I 
was a girl.</p>
<p>"I saw what you had on the computer," a male voice said from behind me.</p>
<p>I froze and asked, "What did you see?" I thought that I was about to be killed.</p>
<p>"I can make it happen if you wish," the guy said. "I just need to know one thing. Do you truly wish to be a girl?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said my heart beating faster. I wasn't going to lie when I was about to die.</p>
<p>"Then come with me," the guy said. "Oh by the way. My name is Mark." As I followed him he said, "There are those of us that keep 
an eye out for people like you. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that I'm going to kill you. But ask yourself why you're 
following me if you think that."</p>
<p>"You'll just kill me later and I'm tired of being in this body," I said with a sigh. "At least if you kill me I might be born a girl in my next 
life."</p>
<p>"I see," Mark said nodding. After a bit we arrived at a house and he said, "Come in."</p>
<p>"This your house?" I asked as I walked in.</p>
<p>"Yes it is," Mark said leading me to a bedroom. Once inside he said, "Strip and I'll be right back." Sighing I stripped and stood there 
waiting waiting for him to come back. When he does he's also naked and he hands me an animal skin flask and says, "You need to 
drink all of this."</p>
<p>"Will it hurt?" I asked unscrewing the top.</p>
<p>"It won't hurt at all," Mark said.</p>
<p>Shrugging I quickly drank what was in the flask. It had a slightly sweet flavor to it. Once I had finished drinking it I look at Mark and 
realize that he's a bit taller than me now. I look down at my body and see my dick shrinking until it wasn't there anymore. My whole 
body looked like it was becoming slimmer like a girl's. My chest expanded out a bit into what was clearly breasts. I felt my hair tickling 
my back as it lengthened down to my waist. I think the whole transformation took about fifteen minutes and fortunately it wasn't painful. I 
looked in a mirror and saw that my hair had changed from black to honey blonde hair and my eyes had gone from green to ice blue. My 
face looked more feminine and when I placed my hand between my legs I felt the genitals of a girl. "It worked," I said liking my new 
voice.</p>
<p>"I told you I could transform you into a girl," Mark said.</p>
<p>I turned around and saw that he was taller than me but he looked like he was about twelve now instead of late twenties. "Why did 
you regress?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well the transformation has to be made permanent and one of those ways is to have sex," he said looking down. "I didn't want to 
have sex with you if I was 27 and you were 12 so I became 12 as well. Having sex will make both of our transformations permanent. 
Don't worry about anything though. You'll wake up in your own bed tomorrow and you'll still be a virgin. Us having sex will have been 
your first wet dream."</p>
<p>As he moved closer to me I could see that his hair and eyes had changed color slightly and his face looked a bit different too. 
Feeling a little flutter of my heart I asked, "Will I see you after this?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Mark said a bit of sadness in his voice. "It depends on where we end up. We could end up in different cities, in the 
same city but go to different schools, go to the same school, or we could be brother and sister which would be weird for both of us."
</p>
<p>"That would be weird," I said. "What will happen if we don't have sex?"</p>
<p>"Well there are other ways to make the transformation permanent but none of the others are as pleasurable," Mark said getting 
really close to me. "If the transformation isn't made permanent you will transform back into your old self in 60 days. Once it's made 
permanent though you can never go back to your old self but you could become male again."</p>
<p>He was so close now that I could swear that I felt the heat from his skin. I was getting hot myself and when he touched me it felt 
like an electricity shot from the place he touched me to my groin. I reached out and touched his penis causing it to harden in moments. 
I smiled as he laid me down on the bed and he rubbed my breast which I knew to be a double A cup. How I knew that I didn't know I 
just knew. I also knew that I wore training a training bra, I was 4 foot 8, weighed 70 pounds, and will turn 13 on July 15. He smiled and 
penetrated me as things took on a dream like quality.</p></p>
