<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Through the door entered Dalton’s opponent, a man in his late-forties.  He looked like a jock gone to seed, with the remnants of a muscular physique, but there was a subtle softness to his figure and six-pack abs that had been replaced by a soft paunch.  His dark hair was receded and there was white in amongst the black stubble on his chin.  Though, he looked a little ridiculous wearing a bubblegum pink morphsuit with a bright green stripe running horizontally across his midsection.<br />
<br />
The man smiled at Dalton when he saw him, the lines around his mouth and eyes deepening.  He held his hand out to Dalton.<br />
<br />
“I’m Landry.  I guess you’re my guy?”  There was a subtle country twang to his voice that wasn’t unenjoyable.<br />
<br />
Dalton hesitantly shook the man, Landry’s, hand.  “I guess.  I’m Dalton.”<br />
<br />
Landry sat in the seat opposite Dalton and fastened on his own wrist straps.  “I’m going to admit that I’m just here to get some random changes in.  I’m not too good at trivia myself.  How ‘bout you?”<br />
<br />
Dalton shrugged.  “I guess we’ll find out.  I’m, uh, not usually this fat.  There was this food truck and, well…”<br />
<br />
Landry grinned and raised a hand.  “Say no more.  I hear ya.  I’ve had a few changes, myself.  I’m actually a little younger than a look, as well as a few other things…”  Landry put his hands to his cheeks, smooshing the middle-aged skin around.  “What do you think?  The others keep telling me I look distinguished, but I think that I just look like a grape that’s been left in the sun too long.”<br />
<br />
Both were interrupted by a computerized voice coming from the screen on the far wall of the room.  “Attention contestants:  The quiz will start shortly.  Before we begin, we would like to go over the rules.  Please pay attention.”<br />
<br />
The computer reiterated that there were five rounds of quizzes.  After each category was announced, but before the question was asked, each contestant would have the opportunity to wager a change.  If the answered correctly, they would earn their wagered change, and the opposite change would happen their opponent.  It added that due to limitations in technology and to make the experience more interesting, limits would be placed on the amounts of some changes.  After the five rounds, the quiz would be over and the contestants were to leave the booth.<br />
<br />
“Please select the ‘Yes’ option on your computer screen if you understand these rules.”<br />
<br />
Dalton turned to see the smaller screen on the table in front of him was duplicating the larger screen on the far wall, with addition of large “Yes” and “No” buttons.  Dalton tapped the “Yes” button and a large green checkmark appeared on his screen, along with a happy “Ding!”<br />
<br />
Dalton glanced up at Landry, who grinned back at him.<br />
<br />
“Good luck, kid.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Dalton mumbled.<br />
<br />
The lights in the room darkened.<br />
<br />
“Contestants Landry and Dalton, the quiz is about to start.  This room is now broadcasting.  3… 2… 1…  Quiz start!<br />
<br />
“Question One.  Category: Pop Culture.  Please make your wagers.”<br />
<br />
Dalton turned to his computer screen.  An on-screen keyboard had appeared.  He supposed it didn’t matter what he wagered.  There was no penalty to getting a question wrong.  Well, other than that the other person would get a chance to answer.  Still, he might as well do what he came here to do.<br />
<br />
He looked down and examined his stomach, trying to guess how much weight he had gained.  He typed onto the screen “Lose 100 pounds.”<br />
<br />
Red words appeared above his wager.  “Wagers of weight can be no higher than 20 pounds.”<br />
<br />
Dalton grumbled to himself.  He would have to do this a bit at a time.  He changed his wager to “Lose 20 pounds.”  He hit Enter and a green checkmark appeared on his screen.<br />
<br />
“Wagers accepted.  Here is the question:  What alien superhero is known by many names, including ‘The Last Son of Krypton?’<br />
<br />
Dalton’s chubby palm slammed onto the face of his computer screen, triggering the buzzer.<br />
<br />
“Contestant Dalton, your answer?”<br />
<br />
“Superman!”<br />
<br />
“That is… correct!  Please be gentle with the equipment, contestants.”<br />
<br />
Despite himself, Dalton pumped his fist.  “Yes!”  He felt some of the weight slide off him as his waistline trimmed back slightly.<br />
<br />
Landry grinned as he glanced down at his own stomach.  His soft paunch expanded, its form rounding out more.  His face seemed to soften as well, the flesh under his chin drooping a bit.  “Oh, you booger!  That was an easy one!  I shoulda got that!”<br />
<br />
Dalton felt relieved.  With five questions and 20 pounds each, he would have this weight gone in no time.  While he did feel a little bad for Landry, he reminded himself that none of this was permanent.  At least he wouldn’t have to waddle around like this for the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
“Question Two.  Category: Geography.  Please make your wagers.”<br />
<br />
Dalton quickly tapped in his wager, “Lose 20 pounds,” and hit Enter.<br />
<br />
“Wagers accepted.  Here is the question:  The subject of recent controversy, what is the new official name of the highest peak in North America?”<br />
<br />
Dalton’s mind went blank.  He knew this!  He had to know this.  It had been Mount McKinley, but they wanted the new name.  What was it?  It was on the tip of his tongue…<br />
<br />
There was a loud buzz, and it wasn’t Dalton.  He turned to see Landry had his own hand on his screen, and he was grinning confidently.<br />
<br />
“Contestant Landry, your answer?”<br />
<br />
“That would be ‘Denali,’ ma’am.”<br />
<br />
“That is… correct!”<br />
<br />
Dalton glanced at his computer screen.  “Landry wins wager.  Landry: Youthen 10 years.  Dalton: Age 10 years.”<br />
<br />
Dalton watched as the white in Landry’s stubble darkened, leaving only a small smattering.  His hairline pushed back forward, but still failed to completely recover.  The lines in his forehead and around his eyes softened and his face seemed to lose some of its sagginess.  He had regressed from his late-forties to his late-thirties.<br />
<br />
He grinned at Dalton.  “Sorry, kid, but it’s only temporary.”<br />
<br />
Dalton realized he was aging into his late-twenties.  He didn’t feel he changed all that much.  His face matured, becoming more adult and less like a teen’s.  His facial hair finished filling in, giving him an even covering of dark stubble.  His body hair also filled in, becoming fairly thick, though hidden under his morphsuit.  His muscles also filled out a bit, though their development was hidden under his fat.  He even managed to grow a quarter inch.<br />
<br />
Dalton wasn’t terribly upset.  Like Landry had said, it was only temporary.  He could live with being a few years older; it was the weight he couldn’t stand.<br />
<br />
“Question Three.  Category: English Literature.  Please make your wagers.”<br />
<br />
Dalton took a calming breath.  He didn’t know much about literature.  Still, he entered his usual bet, trying to summon up all he could remember about the Literature classes he’d only payed half-attention to.<br />
<br />
“Wagers accepted.  Here is the question: The summer of 1816 was so cold, it forced Mary Shelly to stay inside and write what classic horror story?”<br />
<br />
Landry buzzed in almost immediately.<br />
<br />
“Contestant Landry, your answer?”<br />
<br />
“That’s Frankenstein, ma’am.”<br />
<br />
“That is… correct.  We would also have accepted, The Modern Prometheus.”<br />
<br />
Landry turned and grinned at Dalton.  “I love me some horror.”<br />
<br />
Dalton scowled when he saw the results screen.  “Landry wins wager.  Landry: Youthen 10 years.  Dalton: Age 10 years.”<br />
<br />
The last of the white disappeared from Landry’s stubble.  The wrinkles in his face smoothed away, leaving only some subtle indentations in his forehead.  His hairline marched forward, regaining its original coverage.  He tousled his own hair, seemingly glad to have it all back.  The sagginess in his flesh firmed up, making him look younger.  The softness he had originally had firmed up as well, making him look like quite the athlete.  The only blemish on his athletic frame was the 20 pounds Dalton had given him, softening his abdomen and rounding out his jaw.  Still, Landry seemed to be much happier to be in his late-twenties.<br />
<br />
Dalton was just the opposite, however.  As he progressed into his late-thirties, his form sagged a little, the added weight taking a toll on his body.  Jowl lines began to form around his mouth, as well and crow’s feet around his eyes.  As wrinkles formed in his forehead, his hairline crawled back some, the beginning of male pattern baldness.  A few grey hairs appeared as wisps over his ears.<br />
<br />
This was getting annoying now.  Dalton didn’t want to be old AND fat.  He just wanted to lose some weight.  Was that too much to ask?<br />
<br />
“Question Four.  Category: Sports.  Please make your wagers.”<br />
<br />
Dalton hastily typed in his usual and hit Enter.<br />
<br />
“Wagers accepted.  Here is the question: In American baseball, who was the first Major League player to have his number retired?”<br />
<br />
Before Dalton even had a moment to think, he heard the buzzer ring.<br />
<br />
“Contestant Landry, your answer?”<br />
<br />
“That’s Lou Gehrig, ma’am.”  Landry’s voice was noticeably lighter and smoother than before.<br />
<br />
“That is… correct.”<br />
<br />
“Landry wins wager.  Landry: Youthen 7 years.  Dalton: Age 7 years.”<br />
<br />
Landry grinned at his screen.  “Lookit that!  Now I should be an even 21.  What about you, old man?  What’re you up to, now?”<br />
<br />
Landry’s features lost their mature edge, giving him a fresh, youthful look.  If he shaved, he could easily pass for a senior in high school.<br />
<br />
The extra few years pushed Dalton into his mid-forties.  His hairline retreated further back as a bald spot developed on the back of his head.  His stubble thickened, appearing to form a short beard.  Grey speckled onto his chin as grey streaks thickened on the sides of his scalp, and grey hairs peppered the rest.  The wrinkles around his eyes deepened and his face sagged a little.  Dalton gained some weight as middle-aged spread took over, making him lose what little ground he’d gained with the first question.<br />
<br />
Dalton glared at Landry’s smug, grinning face.  While his optimistic attitude had been appealing at the beginning, it was now very annoying.<br />
<br />
“Final Question.  Category: Geography.  Please make your wagers.”<br />
<br />
Dalton considered trying to give Landry back some of his age.  He guessed that the maximum he could wager was 10 years, otherwise Landry would have been wagering more.  Wager weight would get rid of what he had gained from aging, but wagering the age would make his younger as well as remove the weight from aging.  There was also the added bonus of throwing some of the age back at Landry and putting him back up over 30.  He decided to go for it.<br />
<br />
Just as a test, he typed in “Youthen 20 years.”<br />
<br />
“Wagers of age can be no higher than 10 years.”<br />
<br />
It was just as he thought.  “Youthen 10 years.”<br />
<br />
“Wagers accepted.  Here is the question: What is the state capital of Kansas?”<br />
<br />
Dalton slammed his meaty hand onto the screen right as the computer finished reading the question.  Landry didn’t even have time to react.<br />
<br />
“Contestant Dalton, your answer?”<br />
<br />
Crap.  Dalton had buzzed in so fast he hadn’t even given himself time to consider the question.  “Uh, uh, Kansas City!”  His voice sounded deeper and gravellier than before.<br />
<br />
“That is… incorrect.  Please be gentle with the equipment, contestants.  Contestant Landry, would you like to steal?”<br />
<br />
Landry grinned wide.  “Yes I would, ma’am.”<br />
<br />
“Contestant Landry, your answer?”<br />
<br />
“The capital of Kansas is Topeka, ma’am.”<br />
<br />
“That is… correct.”<br />
<br />
“Landry wins wager.  Landry: Lose 20 pounds.  Dalton: Gain 20 pounds.”<br />
<br />
The soft curve to Landry’s stomach melted away, as his jaw became hard and angular.  He patted his flat stomach, satisfied.  “Much better.”<br />
<br />
Dalton groaned as his stomach expanded slightly, straining the fabric of his morphsuit.  He did not like how this had turned out, not one bit.  Instead of losing weight, he got turned into a fat, middle-aged, balding man.  This was not what he wanted at all.<br />
<br />
“The Transformation Super-Quiz is over.  Please leave your wrist straps on the table and leave the room.  Thank you for playing and enjoy the rest of the Transformation Fair.”<br />
<br />
The screens all went blank and the lights brightened.  Landry sprang to his feet, enjoying his regained youth.  “That was fun, old man.  I’m better at this than I thought!”<br />
<br />
Dalton struggled out of his chair, fighting against his bulk and a pain in his lower back.  Landry stepped toward him and offered a hand.  “Need some help, guy?”<br />
<br />
Dalton ignored his offer and finally pulled himself to his feet.  “I’m not your guy, pal,” he hissed.<br />
<br />
Landry withdrew his hand and shrugged.  “Easy, there, man.  No hostility meant.  It’s all in good fun.”  He continued to grin at Dalton.<br />
<br />
“Fun?”  Dalton gestured to his overweight, overaged body.  “Do you think this looks like fun?  It hurts when I walk, I’m sweating all the time, and people are constantly looking at how fat I am!  I came here to get rid of this thing!”  He grabbed his gut and viciously shook it, causing his whole body to jiggle.  “I don’t want to be like this!”<br />
<br />
Landry’s grin had vanished.  He threw his hands up and spoke softly, trying to calm the upset Dalton.  “Easy there, fella.  Calm down, man.  It ain’t so bad.  Believe me, I’ve been here for a while.  I’ve seen some people in way worse shape than you.  Listen, if you need a hand I might be able to help.  You just gotta know where to look, is all.”<br />
<br />
Dalton cleared his throat.  He’d begun to tear up in frustration.  He forced himself to calm down.  It would be even more embarrassing to cry now that he was a man in his forties.  While he wasn’t in to mood to accept Landry’s help, his offer seemed genuine.  Though, he supposed he could try the quiz again with a different opponent.  Maybe he would have better luck.<br />
<br />
Dalton considered his options…</p>
