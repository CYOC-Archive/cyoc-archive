<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan and the Witch had gone to the back room where all of the witch’s belongings were. They stood around a cauldron watching Steve grow into a minotaur.<br />
<br />
“This week, you will help me create the next 12 nights of his changes. Once we’re done, I will teach you the basics of magic and you will get to create our friend Steven’s last change.” The witch said.<br />
<br />
“If you’re choosing his changes, did it really cost him anything?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s the end of his dissatisfaction, he should have to earn it. Besides, I get to toy with him, and that makes me happy. Now fetch me some supplies from the Markets. If you start with Luminous, you can circle back to Natural and be back sooner. Just tell the owners it’s for You.” The witch froze for a moment before adding, “You is my name, dear.” And she sent Ryan to the market.<br />
<br />
......................<br />
<br />
Steve was jostled awake by his father.  “There’s my big man!” Steve was confused for a moment before he saw that he had an erection creating a tent in his blanket. It wasn’t big enough for questions, but he quickly adjusted himself before it got any worse. Already off to a bad start.<br />
<br />
“I made you some eggs, but you can take your time. I think you should take a shower first,” his dad said. Steve nodded and waited for his dad to leave. He quickly shut the door and grabbed his largest pair of boxers and a towel. He wrapped himself with the towel and went to take a shower. Steve got in and the warm water felt really good on his fur and muscles, so good that he started to get hard.<br />
<br />
“Let me just make sure that I’m working...” Steve muttered. He grabbed a lot of soap and started to work himself into an orgasm. He used one hand to rub his massive cock and the other explored his body, feeling his horns, rubbing his chest and nipples, he was in ecstasy. Soon he felt his balls pull in, and Steve began to shoot out loads of cum. He nearly passed out from the pleasure.<br />
<br />
When Steve was done and finally recovered, he made sure to clean the shower and himself off. He got out and dried off, then headed to his room to change. He put on a hat to hide the horns and sweatpants to keep his legs in check. The shirt didn’t matter, but a tight one would show off his muscles better. Steve put on boots and headed to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Hey dad? I was thinking about spending time with mom for a few weeks before I go to college?” Steve asked. His father answered, “I was hoping you’d go to say goodbye, and if it takes you a fee weeks then I’ll see you in a few weeks.” Steve had this little victory. He could go see his friend and just stay there for the two weeks. He finished breakfast, then packed a bag with his belongings and headed out after saying goodbye to his dad.<br />
<br />
Steve had a few troubles driving with hooves, but he made it to his friend Caitlyn’s house. He was anxious, but knocked on her door anyways. It took a minute, but she answered.<br />
<br />
“Steve! You’re taller! Just hitting puberty you stupid teen,” she said, nudging his groin. But she hit it a little hard and a little low, and it gave her a sense of what he was packing. “Oh, my god Steve... was that?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but can you let me in and explain?” he asked. She led him inside and they went into her basement. It was a bit small, Caitlyn’s family used to use it for renting people out but they stopped when the police showed up for the tenant one time. Steve saw this as the perfect place to stay for a while.<br />
<br />
“So, last night I kind of had this thing and anyways, I was given the power to shapeshift, so long as I paid a ‘price,’ so to speak,” Steve said. “I can’t control it for two weeks, and I came here to ask if I could stay until then?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah I can try to keep you,” Caitlyn said. “But I have conditions of my own.” She looked at Steve, but he only sat in silence and she took that as a cue to go on. “First, I get unlimited access to you until your time is up. If I want to see what’s happening...” she trailed, looking at Steve’s groin with a sly smile. “...then you have to let me.”<br />
<br />
“I know we’re friends, but don’t you think that’s a little weird? Even if you liked me?” Steve asked.<br />
<br />
“Who said I didn’t? And second, when you can control it, I want one full day with your powers. Just you and I, living it up. Deal?” Caitlyn asked. Steve contemplated. “Deal,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Cool. Then get naked, I want to see what the hell happened to my friend!” She said excitedly. Steve got up slowly, and then pulled down his sweat pants. His dick was still too big soft and half of it was pushing out of his boxers. He took his hat off and his shirt, then reluctantly pulled his boxers off completely.<br />
<br />
“Wow.” Caitlyn said, walking up to him. She walked around him and just admired the change. He was a real minotaur! And he would be able to change himself anyway he wanted. Caitlyn knew that time with hin would be fun, but she kept quiet. “Thank you, Steve. You’re free to live in my house.” And she walked upstairs.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was mindlessness. Steve called his boss and said that he had to quit, and besides that he sat downstairs, watching T.V. and eating snacks. It wasn’t until a news report came on that said it was 11:30 that Steven groaned. He was safe now, but he wasn’t sure what kind of change would come next. Caitlyn seemed to hear him and she went downstairs.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” She asked. Steve nodded, but Caitlyn walked over to him anyways. “Can I sleep with you? Not like, sexually.. yet.. I mean, well... oh fuck I’m just gonna sleep on the couch.” Steve was laughing at her, but told her,<br />
<br />
“I change every night at midnight. That’s why I was groaning because it’s like 11:35 now.” Both of them sat in silence for a moment before Steve spoke again, “Can you record it this time? I don’t care what happens to me, but I would like to see what’s happening.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I can do that. Let me grab my phone charger.” Caitlyn said. She rushed around the house preparing herself for tonight and by the time she went back down, she could see Steve sweating.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll get undressed. Just promise me you won’t share this?” he asked. Caitlyn nodded and started recording. It took a moment, but Steve began to change. Firstly, all of his new changes went away. The hair receded the muscles receded, and he had to say goodbye to his monster cock as well. At 12 exactly he stood completely as himself again when he felt his body changing once more.<br />
<br />
Steve felt all fuzzy and he knew his body was changing, but he passed out right after. He was jostled awake by Caitlyn who was holding her phone. “Hey you big idiot,” she said. She showed Steve her phone and it was loaded to the video of the night before. Steve watched, and it showed himself changing, expect he was masterbating the whole time. That didn’t happen last time though, so why now?<br />
<br />
The video continued, and it showed Steve’s muscles becoming more toned and muscular, his skin was becoming darker and he had curly black hairs on his chest and on his groin. He watched himself become circumcised as a bigger cock head poked out and became a deep brown, along with the rest of his body. Steve’s hair receded and a layer of body fat grew on him that really made his body pop, and he ended with a major climax, shooting a load on the rug before passing out.<br />
<br />
The video stopped and Steve looked down at himself. He had to admire that he was extremely hot, and he wondered what being black would be like. Caitlyn left Steve breakfast and left him alone.<br />
<br />
This is how Steve’s week continued: breakfast, T.V, lunch, jerk off, dinner, T.V, and Caitlyn would come down and watch him change. For day 3, Steve became some kind of muscle bear? He grew light brown hair all over his body, on his abs, on his ass, all over his arms and legs, and on his fave he had a salt and peppered beard with graying hairs on top. He also swelled out with muscle and body fat, giving him a large appearance, but smooth skin all over. His dick once again grew, but instead of growing out it became much thicker, and his balls expanded a bit as well. Steve was the screaming definition of a muscle bear.<br />
<br />
For day 4, Steve became a woman. This one made Caitlyn laugh, but Steve put up with it for the day. He became smaller in stature and a bit more petite, but for a woman he had everything going for “her” now. Light brown slin, huge tits that actually made Caitlyn jealous, and a big smooth ass that probably get anyone to follow her around. But Steve didn’t want to play games, so he once again waited this transformation out.<br />
<br />
For day 5, Steve was changed into a Korean man. He had a lot more muscle, but his body hair receded and so did much of his body fat. While his dick didn’t get and thicker, it did grow out to about 9” and still about 5” around.<br />
<br />
For day 6, Steve became an older woman. It wasn’t a very pretty sight to behold, and it was basically just an older version of the woman he had turned into before. Steve began to follow the pattern for this week: his “junk” was always much bigger than normal. His cock always grew when he was a man and both times he was a woman he was considerably large. He anticipated day 7, only that was also the day things became much less conventional. Much weirder, but it showed the power that Steve would have<br />
<br />
On day 7, Caitlyn came down as usual and Steve turned into himself again at 12:00. Once he felt the changes go again, this time was different. He tried to close his eyes, but something was keeping them open. He looked around and saw his arms pull into his body, and his legs began to fuse together. He tried screaming, but all Steve was at the moment was flesh. Steve’s hair receded and his head became more round and soft. His body was becoming softer, but slowly tensing up and getting harder. He kept getting shorter and his current dick and balls pulled inside of him. The heels of his feet were pushing out underneath him, growing into some kind of spheres, and out of his ass something massive was growing. Eventually Steve was forced to look up, and he figured out what was happening.<br />
<br />
“I’m becoming my dick. What the fuck.” He thought. He watched as out of his ass grew another copy of himself. His “legs” grew out and Steve was finally able to rest there as a dick while he watched his arms and head grow up. Steve had grown another copy of himself, only the real Steve was stuck as his own dick. He had to admit though, that he had a really nice body from this angle, which started to change Steve. He became hard and felt his body stretch out. He stretched out farther than he expected, and then remembered that the whole pattern was about becoming absurdly large. He felt his own scrotum being bigger than usual, and he was beginning to make “fake” Steve pay attention to his new cock. He began to pull on Steve, starting to jerk off into an orgasm.<br />
<br />
Steve never thought he’d be so self centered, but watching and feeling himself jerk off himself was incredible. Maybe his own body was adjusted by the change, but he admired his own muscles and how big he himself was. He felt fake Steve start to climax, and real Steve just let it out and it felt incredible. He was at the center of it all and he was just lost in it. Steve regained his focus about a few hours later, but his fake self was sleeping. Steve thought about getting hard again and he did, reaching out in aching pain, wanting to be touched. <br />
<br />
That was how the rest of the day went. Steve would wait to be played with again and he’d lose focus. Once he came back he did it over and over. He didn’t care about his mess, he just wanted the pleasure, until eventually, Caitlyn came down. He knew his time was up.<br />
<br />
Steve had to be happy, as this change did have its drawbacks. But he was happy to start week two. Steve did hold one thought however. If this is how week one ended, how is week two going to go?</p>
