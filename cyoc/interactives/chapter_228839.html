<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was feeling disappointed with being human again. As Diana she didn’t have to worry about school or social obligations which felt so freeing not to worry and stress about most things humans have problems with. Now having turn back Jeff was now facing even more stress and responsibilities than ever before, he was looking at going to college soon which would be nothing but study, tests and social pressure there might be a party at some point but would it really outweigh all the other negatives. Then after college what then work for decades for a job he’ll most likely hate for a family he may or may not hate. Life as Diana was far more simpler and carefree, food was brought to her, people often praised and played with her and entertainment came far easier to achieve. Now Jeff had the ability to make his life into hers. It would mean giving up a human span for one that would only last 15 years at the max but Jeff was also thinking of the quality of those years, at this point in his life the decades he would live will be nothing but work then once he reach a comfortable living standard to retire he would bee too old to truly enjoy life, while Diana’s 1.5 decades would be filled with playing, sleeping and joy also with a little luck she may not be so lonely as she was the first time. So with that figured out Jeff decided he would no longer be human the life of Diana would be her true self not Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately started setting the Chronivac to what he was before having reality shift set to that his family always had Diana as a family pet, making his setup of that of a 1 year female Doberman Pinscher that was unspayed and primed for breeding, he also had it so she would be healthy for her entire life and even shift reality a bit for Dobermans to have a slightly longer life span of 20 years, as for mental settings he decided what he had before was good animal instincts and preferences taking front seat while his human personality and memories set to the back, Jeff then decided to fidget with reality shift enhancing the life of Diana even more, first he made so that his family would serve Diana only high quality wet dog food or raw meat/veggies with plenty of treats he remembered the few times as Diana when she was served this it was alway a delight from the kibble she usually ate, next Jeff made it so that his current room would be Diana’s room filled with dog toys, food and bedding since Jeff made it so Diana was most likely going to be bred it made perfect sense to give her a room to nest and raise her pups and lastly Jeff made it so that if Diana ever did have pups they would all be healthy and happy spending a good long while with their mother before finding good homes for all of them. With all the setting just how Jeff wanted them all that remained was the duration which was set to permanent and Jeff hesitated for a moment, was he really going to sacrifice his life bipedal humanoid life for that of a canine bitch one where she could sleep all day, play with adorable puppies and be treated as a queen, Jeff quickly hit the enter button.<br />
<br />
The first thing Jeff felt after executing the program was a sense of dizziness as the room around him melted with light the furniture and human decoration vanished leaving behind a large comfy doggy bed, chew toys and food dishes, as the room turned into a dog nursery the computer with the program also disappeared which concerned Jeff for a second as he had no way of making new changes but his resolve soon harden he choose this life and was happy about it. The next change that came was his skin starting to itching knowing what was coming Jeff stripped his clothes off as he would not be needing them shortly throwing the useless garments away causing them to melt with the rest of the room. Black and brown fur has started sprouting across his body, his fingers shrunk as his palms and finger tips thicken turning into paws, his chest became highly sensitive as Jeff felt the two rows of teats form revealing the future of his new sex. As these changes took place Jeff/Diana’s mind changed with them her mind began racing with new canine thoughts to chase small animals, bark at intruders to her home and lost understanding of human language she still recognized certain sounds and phases for commands but beyond those commands it was senseless gibberish. Diana then felt the need to stand on all fours as she transitioned to her quadrupedal stance her arms and legs shorten until the position felt more comfortable on four legs rather than two, as Diana now stood at two feet her torso thinned and constricted into a streamlined Doberman shape finishing with a short curled tail growing from her rear. As Diana was now more her true self than what she was before new memories started to fill her mind her mother’s milk, this family adopting her and all the fun she has had in this house, while she knew she was once the teenage human Jeff his memories took less importance than her current dog ones. After Diana’s memory reset the final changes for her to become a true dog first his male genitalia was sucked into her body leaving behind a perfectly tight dog pussy for when she becomes a mother, her neck stretched forward along with the rest of head her mouth and nose pushing off her face forging into a singular mass a muzzle was forming, causing her teeth to become larger and sharper, her nose flat and wet and her tongue long and thick. Her ears grew massive to what size they were before and shifted to now be resting on top of her head drastically improving her hearing, her eyes grew larger with a predominant brown color to them but unlike her ears her vision didn’t overall improve the picture was clear any other human yet she lost many of her sense for certain colors. Once everything was finished instead of a 17 year old boy in his messy room a beautiful female Doberman Pinscher stood in a still messy play room.</p>
