<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I don't know whether Dirk knew I could see even as a jockstrap or not, but he had elected to wear mesh shorts <br />
today, so I could see. Not much of view looking up at the underside of the steering column and dashboard in <br />
Dirk's car, but when we got to his destination I recognized where he was going. It was Derek's place.  The <br />
last place I had entered while I still had two legs. Well, I assume I still have my legs, but I don't know for <br />
certain.  The mad scientist streak in Derek resulted in me volunteering for his experiment.  I am still lying <br />
in the basement laboratory hooked up to a machine, while my mind and sensory faculties are wired into the <br />
jockstrap wrapped around Dirk's loins. Sadistic Derek meant to get rid of me this way.  He had intended for me <br />
to end up in the lost and found after wearing me through a humiliating work out. I had no idea Dirk had evil <br />
interests in me until he intercepted the jockstrap that Derek had tossed.  He knew it was me. He had overheard <br />
Derek talking to me. Now after 2 months of being worn nearly constantly, the bastard had called Derek, and <br />
made an appointment to meet him.  I stared in curious terror as Dirk walked confidently down the steps to <br />
Derek's basement lab. <br />
<br />
Derek welcomed Dirk into his basement laboratory. He was quite proud of his feat.  There was a bearded, pale-<br />
skinned, naked man lying there in the center of the room hooked up to life support and all sorts of weird <br />
machinery. At first, I assumed that he had done this to other guys too.  Then I realized I now had a mustache <br />
and beard, and being indoors for two months had caused my tan line to fade. Then I noticed that there was room <br />
on the big table for at least two more bodies. I wonder if Dirk noticed that in addition to the half filled <br />
catheter bag, there was a fresh unused one, as well as two IV bags, and straps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, Derek, this is so fucking cool!  Mind if I take Jimmy out so he can see himself?&quot; Dirk asked. Without <br />
waiting for a reply his pulled down his shorts in the front and sauntered over to where I lay and shoved me <br />
into my own face.  Okay, I know that doesn't sound right, but from my perspective wrapped around Dirk's <br />
manhood, I was pressed up against my own bearded cheek. The wires coming out of my skull guaranteed that I <br />
didn't feel the jockstrap on my cheek, but felt my bearded face as if it was someone else's.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you're impressed, Dirk.  I can hardly tell people about this experiment's success now can I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I won't tell. I just was wondering if you can hook up his vocal chords, so I can hear how he <br />
likes being my crotch jockey?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek apparently was not expecting this at all,and his jaw dropped, then in changed into a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a novel idea?  I wish I had thought of it. I could have been chatting with James, as he described being <br />
worn by you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh, I'd've loved to heard him scream when I jacked off in him the first time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The first time?&quot; Derek replied.  There was an odd mix of envy, curiosity and anger in his tone. I suspect he <br />
now regretted not jacking off in me when he had the chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;While you think about how to make Jimmy Jockboy squawk so we can hear him, how about you explain to me how <br />
this contraption works?&quot; Dirk asked sincerely. He added, &quot;It truly is amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, Derek, this is marvelous. I'm curious can he hear us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only through the jockstrap. The brain is really disconnected from the body by this synaptic link,&quot; Derek <br />
explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like this one here?&quot; Dirk asked picking up a think black cord with a nasty looking plug with all <br />
sorts of tiny wires sticking out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, the wires are organonanite technology. They come alive with contact with organic material, and will <br />
literally burrow in and integrate themselves into the cerebral cortex and -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So all you had to do was put it on the back of his head right where the spine goes in?&quot; Dirk asked holding <br />
the plug up to the back of his own head.<br />
<br />
Derek looked eager - too eager, &quot;Yes, yes, exactly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Derek moved toward the larger Dirk, and Dirk said the plug down.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you have to keep him alive, and how on earth have you maintained his muscle tone?  Have you considered a <br />
UV lamp?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek laughed, and explained happily how the catheter was attached, and bag to my colon. He emptied both <br />
daily. The muscles were kept toned by electronic stimulation, which explained all the wires crisscrossing my <br />
naked body. The two must have yakked about the device and commented on how much I deserved this fate for over <br />
two hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be thirsty, Dirk,&quot; Derek remarked, &quot;I know I am. Care for a soda?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Water would be better,&quot; Dirk answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Water it is then,&quot; Derek said. <br />
<br />
He soon returned with two bottles of water. He had a red straw in one bottle and a blue one in the other.  He <br />
handed one to Dirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Der,&quot; Dirk said, &quot;Oh, almost forgot, here's that singlet I was wondering if you could wire up to <br />
Jimmy.&quot; He set his bottle down and fished it out of his gym bag. He tossed it to Derek who caught it gingerly. <br />
Once he determined it was clean he took it over to his desk and examined it with a microscope.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be able to weave my nanitic fibers into the spandex, hm?&quot; he said pensively as he studied the fabric.<br />
<br />
After about 30 minutes of silent study, Derek announced, &quot;I think I can do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a sip from his nearly empty water bottle. Dirk noisily slurped up the last of his bottle's contents.<br />
<br />
Derek looked at Dirk and grinned, &quot;Of course, I don't think I will. Your wrestling singlet is way to large for <br />
me to wear.  However, these socks,&quot; he held up a pair of white athletic socks, &quot;will be perfect for you and <br />
Jimmy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you and Jimmy, right?  I switched bottles. Kept the straw,&quot; Dirk grinned.<br />
<br />
Derek looked crestfallen. He stared at his now empty bottle. The doofus had switched his bottle with Derek. <br />
Dirk grabbed Derek and began to strip him down. Derek stood there meekly and didn't resist.  I assumed he was <br />
drugged, but when Dirk tried to put him on the table Derek twisted free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you'd outsmart me, jock boy?  I don't think so, you see...&quot;</p>
