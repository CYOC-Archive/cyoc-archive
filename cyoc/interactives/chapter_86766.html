James woke up and stretched not really remember where he was but he did remember a really weird dream. He closed his eyes as he remembered sucking dicks as more invaded his ass, creamy, delicious cum filling his belly. There was something odd about him though he was dressed weird and felt funny. Suddenly remembering his eyes snap open to a pink sheer draped over a four poster bed. Jolting up in bed he realizes an odd sensation on his chest looking down he sees a pair of small A cup breasts. A cold wave spreads through James as he wakes up to his dream being real. He shouldn&#39;t have breasts or should he, Jamie&#39;s hands cup his breasts and starts to massage them, his eyes roll back, of course he should have them. His breasts were sticky with dried cum, his hand moved down past his tiny dick, nothing more than a large clit as he liked to think of it now, and started to massage his pussy and found it to still leaking with cum. Groaning Jaime got up and found the sheets spotted with dried cum and sighed he would have to do laundry again today, a job hazard. He reached over to the bedside table and grabbed a tampon and slowly slid it up his ass. He sat down in front of his vanity and James was shocked at his appearance. An auguste clown started back at him with pink glittering nose, dramatically made up eyes and a wide slutty smile. <br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t right, I have to get out of here&quot; James got up to leave but sat down again. <br />
Jamie looked at himself in the mirror. &quot;This isn&#39;t right&quot; He saw his purple hair a mess from sleep and cum in it. Viewing the rest of his bodies’ state he decided he needed a hot shower. Standing in the shower the hot water hitting his nose felt so good he reached up and honked it a few times feeling the tingles race down him almost pushed him to an orgasm, he wondered if Boffo would mind him coming early. After cleaning himself up he got out and started to dry himself and felt dizzy.<br />
&#39;Why would he want to go back to Boffo&#39;s? He wasn&#39;t gay.&#39; thoughts swirled in James&#39; head. Jamie shook his head and sat down in front of the vanity and brushed out his long hair. A knock on the door and his roommate Lily came in.<br />
&quot;Good Morning, girl I would offer you breakfast but from what I heard you are probably still full from last night.&quot;<br />
Jamie and Lily laughed &quot;I should grab something else but I did get a lot of protein last night.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you doing today?&quot;<br />
&quot;I have to do laundry and I feeling.... hungry again so I might head into work early.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I can give you a snack to hold you over.&quot; He stood up and dropped his pink panties and a large cock sprung free. Jamie&#39;s eyes glued to the cock and his mouth started to water. He moved forward and grabbed Lily&#39;s butt to pull him in. His beautiful C cup titties made Jamie ache with jealousy, he sucked each nipple in his mouth before moving down. James recoiled at the large erect cock now at his lips.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Lily with a concerned look on his face<br />
&quot;Uh, nothing. I just am full from last night.&quot; Jamie&#39;s eyes dropped once more to the cock in front of him<br />
&quot;Girl, you know you want it.&quot; He slid his cock along Jamie&#39;s lips teasing him before pulling it away as he tried to take it in his mouth.<br />
&quot;Please&quot;<br />
&quot;Please, what&quot;<br />
&quot;Please can I suck your big clit, Ma&#39;am?&quot;<br />
&quot;You may.&quot; He moved it in front of Jamie&#39;s lips as he lean forward and took it in his mouth. The silky warm rod slid into his mouth as he groaned in anticipation. He sucked hard and ran his tongue around the invader as he slowly pulled out. Lily grabbed either side of his head and Jaime surrendered as he began to fuck his mouth. Running his fingers through his hair he got a better hand hold and increased his speed. Jamie angled his head to get more of it in his mouth and was rewarded as he felt it slip down his throat. Lily worked him for ten minutes before his movements became jerky and with a hard thrust he began to spill his seed down his throat. James felt the cock hit hard against his throat and moaned loud in protest. Lily pulled out till just the head was in his mouth at hearing his moan of protest so he could savor the taste to which Jamie moaned in pleasure. Lily finished and pulled out after Jamie sucked every drop he could out of him. Jamie&#39;s clit had leaked all over his clean panties and upon seeing this Jamie sighed.<br />
&quot;Well one more thing to wash but thanks Lily.&quot; He turned and left as Jamie got on fresh underwear and a bra, still savoring the after taste of her morning snack. Jamie&#39;s head buzzed as he leaned against the closet door, something was wrong. James was suddenly horrified at what he had just done, what had been done to him.<br />
&#39;I have to get out of here.&#39; Looking down at his half naked pink body he realized he need clothes and threw open the closet and found nothing but sexy or slutty clown stuff. Looking everywhere for something else he choose the longest skirt which only went to less than mid-thigh and a blouse that still had a low neck that exposed his breasts. Still horrified at having breasts he dashing out of the apartment and into a nondescript street. Not seeing any difference between left or right he choose left and started to walk. Coming to this island was stupid given its reputation and then getting involved in bar sex was absolutely moronic even if he wasn&#39;t on the island and now look at him. James straightened up and decided to feel sorry for himself later as he decided to find the dock and the ferry off this hellish place. After wandering around for a while getting whistles and cat calls from passersbys he found the main street he remembered and began to retrace his steps. Looking behind him he saw Bad Boffo&#39;s and it took all his will power not to walk that direction as an itch developed in his ass. He walked down the street till he saw the ocean and then an old dock with a couple of burly men walking around. Upon approaching them all eyes turned in his direction.<br />
&quot;Hey baby you can give me a laugh.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I can give her some candy to suck on.&quot; The yelling continued as James had to stop in front of them, his lips tingling at the temptation.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....uh....the ferry.....When is the next ferry off the island?&quot; James finally spit out as the men circled around him. They looked at each other in confusion before replying.<br />
&quot;There ain&#39;t a boat off the island, you should know that.&quot; said one large man behind him as his hand found his bottom. Jamie closed his eyes and pushed his ass back into the hand as it began to massage it. Letting out a moan James snapped open his eyes and seeing the crowd around him he darted out.<br />
&quot;Um, thanks.&quot; he began to walk quickly along the street; glancing back he saw the men&#39;s confusion before they signaled to another group in front of him. He turned and saw a pair of men turn and start to walk towards him, turning he took the first side street he could. Starting to walk faster he tried to run but fell fast because of his large clown feet. Cursing he stood up and looking behind saw men turn into the street. Walking fast he took the next turn and found himself at the docks.<br />
&#39;What the fuck? I was walking the opposite direction.&#39; Fear started to take hold as he realized he must have gotten turned around. The men calmly started to walk towards him as James backtracked and took another street. Moving as fast as he could he saw two men turn into the street in front of him and he turned again. He skidded to a stop as he stared at the bar in front of him.<br />
&#39;How can I be back here so fast?&#39; Looking up he saw the familiar sign for Bad Boffo&#39;s. His fear turning to terror James turned and ran back into the maze of side streets. Every turn he made he just couldn&#39;t seem to lose the men, they were always behind him, in front of him or down a side street. Turning down another street he found them in front of him again and turning around he found two behind him. Looking around he found himself trapped before suddenly there was a alleyway to his right. Not knowing where it came from and not having a choice he walked down it to find it a dead-end with a door into a building. Frantically looking around and seeing no other way magically appear he slipped through the door. The men filed into the dead-end and calmly walked through the door. James was standing there in his dressing room looking stunned at ending up at Bad Boffo&#39;s.<br />
&quot;You know most people accept their place on the island but a small few need some more. So let us remind you why you are here.&quot;<br />
The men quickly undressed revealing hard working bodies and equally large working cocks. James felt his lips tingle and like Pavlov&#39;s dog hearing a bell his mouth started to water. One of the men approached him from behind and began to massage his butt as another slip his hands up his shirt and into his bra to massage his tits. James moaned and began to shake as his clothes were removed and he was slowly lowered to the floor. A pair of mouths found his nipples and began to suck on them as a man kneeled over James&#39;s face. James looked at the hard cock above him and raised his head to take it into his mouth. Feeling the hard rod enter his mouth James felt happiness fill him as his nose buried itself into his bush. The man leaned over onto all fours and began to feed his dick to him as another man lifted up his legs on to his shoulders. James felt a probing at his back entrance and quickly pushed back to accept the guest. The air was quickly filled him moans, heavy breathing and the smell of greasepaint and sweat. Jamie quickly became lost in a haze of euphoric bliss as the men began to use her. The man in her throat began to pump in his cum as she eagerly swallowed it her breasts began to inflate and continue to inflate as her ass was filled up too. Another man took his place above her mouth and began his pumping as another took his place behind her running his dick over her perineum and ass. She felt a sucking sensation below he clit as her pussy opened up quickly to suck in a dick. The sensation of a dick sliding in to her pussy was new to her before her eyes crossed and memories flooded her head. She lost count of the number of times she serviced the men who took to jacking off onto her tits which grew as they were filled with each new load. Finally she could no longer take it as the tingles rushed over her, she screamed and arched her back in a mind blowing orgasm. She lay there shaking in the afterglow of her orgasm feeling the cold puddles of cum start to dry on her as they also poured from her pussy and ass.<br />
&quot;Do you remember why you are here?&quot; asked one of the men standing over her. Memories flashed before here, yes she knew.<br />
&quot;I am a slut, a tramp, a fag hag, a performer, a cum receptacle. I am here to service and entertain any man who wants it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. You better get up and ready you are on in 15 minutes.&quot;<br />
Jamie smiled as she got up and looked at herself in the mirror and the cum dripping off her DD tits. She decided she wasn&#39;t wearing enough but the men could help her out after the performance.</p>
