<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You say you have a way to kill the curse?&quot; Joseph Hune, the Mayor of Glendale asked the elderly woman before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my name is Madam Serenity,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;A victim of the game and given the ability to sense when the game is used. For the past few years I have been working as a private investigator in dealing with things related to the game, since the official rules have hogtied the police and the city government in dealing with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A most uncivilized hobby,&quot; Joseph gave a low growl, &quot;I will never understand why people use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some have actually used it for good... or at least had good intentions,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;the problem is that the game's rules don't limit its use to that. It allows anyone who has a grudge against someone, some pervert looking for &quot;women&quot; to like him, or at worst someone with a master plan do something &quot;big&quot; with it. And these actions have generally kept me busy over the years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But now you have a way to end it?&quot; Joseph asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it relates to some recent cases I have been working on, the details I can not disclose because of confidentiality issues,&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;but I can tell you that it was a tough case. In the course of it, I met two Catholic Priests, Fathers Michael and Paul, both victims of the game themselves...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a slight pause as Serenity stopped for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But their curse isn't the issue,&quot; Serenity then spoke, &quot;it's how they dealt with it that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did they do that?&quot; Joseph asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deciding to live with what the curse had done to them the did a lot of research into White Magic and uncovered a powder that dates back to 5th/6th Century Britain,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;and the time of King Arthur...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Merlin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Merlin Ambrosius,&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;the powder kills curses. What Merlin created it for, they either couldn't, or they simply haven't deciphered. But what they did uncover was that the powder could be used to kill individual turns of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we use this powder on everybody and that kills the game?&quot; Joseph asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Serenity answered, &quot;but there are some firm rules that must be followed to use it. In its standard use, the powder is limited to one person at a time, and the powder must be poured in a circle around that person. Once that is done, a Latin incantation must then be spoken to kill the curse in that individual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would take forever to kill the game,&quot; Joseph gave a depressed groan, &quot;not to mention that once the element that you're trying to stop learns what you're doing, they'll leave Glendale and wait until you're done...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that this &quot;cure&quot; was invented before most of the world had indoor pluming, and at the time, the few systems like that that ever existed, made by the Romans were in disrepair, and still relied on gravity,&quot; Serenity told him, &quot;modern pumps and pluming can allow us to expand on the powder's powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultimately, my intention is to dump the powder into the city's water supply,&quot; Serenity explained, &quot;the water pipes would then carry it into every home and business, including the few homes on the outskirts of town, including the few small farms around Glendale and Wolf Manor. The pipes will form the circle for us, and with the sheer volume of the powder used, we'll have enough to use it on everyone in Glendale simultaneously. We may need to set up the city's radio station and have everyone tune in to let Father Michael bless the town with Merlin's incantation, as he hasn't told me if there is a limit on the range of the powder's ability to activate. It might, it might not...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But will this kill the game? End this dreadful curse?&quot; Joseph inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Father Michael and Paul are very confident that the powder has the power to do so,&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;and one of the Big Bad Wolf Pack's pups, a white female named Amy somehow knows of it, and has told me that the powder will work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly don't know how the pup knows,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;though from the interactions I've had with her, she has carried herself like a priestess. Maybe she and the Catholic Priests share some sort of spiritual connection through their faiths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's a Catholic Priest too?&quot; Joseph wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Shinto,&quot; Serenity answered, &quot;My best guess is that she picked it up from the Hokkaido Lupman that are in the Pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Joseph nodded, &quot;what about the qualities of this powder? Is it poisonous?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From the ingredients, I wouldn't think so,&quot; Serenity answered, &quot;some of them are actually put in the water to begin with as part of the purification process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think about this, Chief Gillie?&quot; Joseph then turned to the copper lioness, &quot;we've both had various &quot;snake salesmen&quot; trying to sell a &quot;cure&quot; to the city and profiting off of our efforts to stop a curse that has attacked our homes for over three hundred years.&quot;<br />
<br />

1689<br />
<br />
&quot;You're leaving again, sister?&quot; Winifred's sister asked her twin as the dawn rose over Wolf Manor, &quot;but we still have all this work to do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but if the Hunters kill or execute the witches, and everyone returns to normal...&quot; Winifred answered, &quot;Alpha Ross will expect us to report on what happened. He will be enraged to learn that those three unleashed magic on us, reducing everyone to pups, killing his mate's pups before they could even be born, and if he isn't told that the witches paid for it with their lives, it could lead to war between the Pack and Glendale...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is what we wanted to avoid when our old Packs kicked us all out,&quot; her twin sighed as she looked Europe (though she couldn't see the continent being half the world away), &quot;alright sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is all for the Pack,&quot; Winifred answered, &quot;the more we know, the better off things will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Monica was met by Rosa as she came out to the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;And today it will be over,&quot; Monica said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Rosa sighed, &quot;and we can put this whole uncivilized mess behind us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two slowly made their way toward Witch Manor.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up,&quot; Marie urged as she prodded Linus.<br />
<br />
The man rolled over slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is dawn,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;and there is much we need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus was quickly awake, &quot;Yes much to do. We must get the witches to the tree, and quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're certain you have a branch that will allow the fall to snap their necks?&quot; Marie questioned, &quot;short drops do not do that that often.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As high as we can manage,&quot; Linus answered, &quot;if Katherine took the ropes any higher, they'd never hang. They'd end up sitting in its branches, or the branches would provide them with a fulcrum with which to swing into the branches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie only sighed, &quot;Very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have some horses in the barn attached to the manor,&quot; Linus answered, &quot;we can use them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you wake Katherine and Draco?&quot; Marie asked, &quot;I'll see to the horses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Linus nodded, &quot;and Marie...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie stopped in her departure for the barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vatican is here,&quot; Linus spoke, &quot;apparently Mr. Running-Bear has died. He asked Mal'akh to stay with Joella since his home is a tad worn down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's alone,&quot; Marie spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the witches other victims decide to leave, yes,&quot; Linus nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't leave her alone, Marie,&quot; a voice said to Marie in the back of her head, &quot;you have to protect her.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;A voice?&quot; Betty asked, &quot;she was hearing things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, some could say it was her conscience, some could say it was Azrael's geass,&quot; Marie-Eliza said, &quot;it left Marie feeling responsible for those that were disenfranchised by the defeat and execution of the witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Joella inherited the manor,&quot; Lawrence pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but the legal world would have never accepted Joella as the owner, and Marie had no solid way of knowing whether or not those the witches had gathered would stay at the manor. On that, her second sight was silent.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Golgotha was shaken awake to find the Felman hunter standing nearby, loosely gripping the spear she had used in the battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is time,&quot; Katherine told her, &quot;Do you wish to accept the last rites now, or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GO TO HELL!&quot; Golgotha answered, waking up her sisters.<br />
<br />
Gomorrah tried to bolt, but only made a few steps before the rope snapped taught and she landed on her rear. Golgotha and Gaal then noticed the additional ropes tied around them and leading to Draco, who held onto the end of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;To insure you don't run away and bring your madness on some other innocent town,&quot; came Linus's voice from the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slaves to rules and to the Dog,&quot; Golgotha spat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit insulting my best friend!&quot; Katherine spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has NO friends,&quot; Gaal spat, &quot;all she is, is a killer, and after today, you'll all be as evil as her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE ARE THE ONLY HEROES HERE!&quot; Gomorrah screamed from the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;On your feet, witch,&quot; Linus growled, &quot;If my guardian or your grandmother were here, they would be very disappointed and cross with you for what you have done... to the people of this town, to the those who happened to stumble in, and to yourselves. Quit going on like what you did here was a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three spat at Linus for daring to presume their grandmother wouldn't love what they had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drag them out,&quot; Linus ordered to Draco.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should drug them before we take them out,&quot; Draco answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do this before it wears off,&quot; Linus answered, &quot;the faster this is done the better. And Marie is waiting with the horses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draco sighed and walked forward, holding onto the ropes to make sure that they couldn't run off. Not wanting to be drug, the witches slowly complied and walked behind him. Linus and Katherine brought up the rear to insure they couldn't break free.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The horses proved to be very gentle and easily lead. Marie walked them out into the front yard and slowly held them there. They became a little skittish when they saw Vatican, but the gargoyle pulled away to hold his distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must tell you Marie, that Joseph Running-Bear has died,&quot; Vatican said slowly while Marie kept the horses under control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Linus told me,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;I presume you told him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vatican nodded. Marie continued to quietly hold the horses until Monica and Rosa arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are here,&quot; Monica spoke and then looked around, &quot;Is Mal'akh with her sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mal'akh is in the praying town for the moment,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;caring for Joella. Her grandfather has died and Vatican was a bit too big to adequately console her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully she gets better,&quot; Rosa spoke, &quot;what are the horses for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The horses will be the platform that the witches are dropped from,&quot; Marie sighed, &quot;though we are waiting for the others to bring the witches out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shortly after, Draco came out the front door holding onto long ropes. The witches followed behind with Linus and Katherine bringing up the rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You monsters!&quot; Gaal screamed, &quot;stealing our horses!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie did not answer them, but turned to Vatican, &quot;can you put them on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vatican slowly nodded and approached each witch individually to put it on one of the horses. They did not take to it kindly and spat on him as he carried out his task. They did not protest at not being set side-saddle on &quot;their&quot; horse.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Joella woke up to find herself laying on the couch with Mal'akh laying half on and beside her. And in her sleep the young Leoman licked Joella the way she had the adults of the Witch Pride did with their cubs. Of course, the rough tongue was not what Joella wanted to feel at the moment. She tried to pull herself away without disturbing Mal'akh, but ended up going backwards off the couch and landing on the wood floor. That woke Mal'akh up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Mal'akh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa is dead, my mothers are going to die,&quot; Joella said weakly, &quot;they only wanted to make everyone happy... how can I be happy? What will the Hunters do to me now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll probably be allowed to be who you were before the witches made you Joella,&quot; Mal'akh guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have ALWAYS been Joella!&quot; Joella answered, &quot;it is who I am!...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was only guess,&quot; Mal'akh told her, &quot;and if not transformed back, I'm sure they'd try to make sure you're looked after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you save grandpa?&quot; Joella turned to Mal'akh.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... he is likely with the Lord now,&quot; Mal'akh answered, &quot;come on, I'll see if there is something you can have for breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Winifred arrived in the center of Glendale to find the hunters leading three horses toward a large trees with nooses hanging down. It did appear as though the Hunters had won the battle and were now moving to end the witches' threat. The young looking Human Monica and Leoman Rosa were also with them. She then slowly approached, knowing that they would notice her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Omega-Winifred,&quot; Marie was the one who gasped, &quot;You've come...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When our Alphas are restored, they will want a report on what happened and what was a threat to the Pack,&quot; Winifred answered, &quot;and a report happened to that threat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Marie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;STUPID DOGS! YOU'D ALL FIT WELL TOGETHER! WE HOPE YOU STRANGLE ON YOUR LAWS! ONLY WHEN RULES ARE GONE WILL ANYONE BE FREE!&quot; the witches yelled together.<br />
<br />
That only elicited a snarl from Winifred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our &quot;laws&quot; are the only thing that has prevented war between my pack and Glendale,&quot; Winifred answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not worth it,&quot; Marie told them.<br />
<br />
While they talked, Vatican took over holding the reigns while Draco took up the task of moving each noose around the neck of one of the witches and making sure the knot was as tight as possible. Again the witches didn't behave kindly, but Draco expected it. Unknown to him, Linus's hurry to hang them was creating the problem Draco had feared. For the length of the trail, Golgotha and her sisters felt disconnected from their magic, but now they were starting to feel a slight twinge of it. And noticing where they were, a chance for revenge struck Golgotha's mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are ready,&quot; Draco said to Marie and Linus as he landed.<br />
<br />
Marie moved away from Winifred, who went to stand by Monica and Rosa, while the five Hunters stood together in a fairly straight line.<br />
<br />
&quot;As with the law, I must ask if you have any last words before your sentence is carried out?&quot; Marie spoke to the three.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've ruined all that is good in the world!&quot; Gaal snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will get even with you!&quot; Gomorrah added.<br />
<br />
&quot;For you five are the worst of the lot and will carry this curse to spread misery to all those who believe in laws,&quot; Golgotha began, &quot;And Glendale will always feel it! The mind of this curse. Ever present! Everlasting! Only when they reject laws will Glendale be free... FOR IT MUST COME! And if you do not answer this curse in time... you will surrender to our mercy!&quot;<br />
<br />
The witches said the last line together, &quot;TRANSFORM OR DARE!&quot;</p>
