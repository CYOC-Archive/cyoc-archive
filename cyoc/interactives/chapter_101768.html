<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It&#39;s pretty cool&quot; Martin said. &quot;I guess so!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humm...Martin is kind of a friend of mine&quot; Kyle said. He was concerned that they might hurt him or harm him. Becca gave him a wicked smille and changed a look with Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Martin, if you want you can drink a beer or two&quot; she said. &quot;I really hope that this night stays between us and you&#39;ll tell no one. As no one would believe in you, but everyone would beleive when I&#39;d say you run to the town&#39;s greenhouse to smoke&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Cassie&quot;he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Cassie, she&#39;s Sam&quot; Cassie corrected. He knew it, but seeing Sam&#39;s annoyed face was priceless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what happened to you, why are you like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my family&#39;s curse. We are werefrogs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, seriously? Is it a family disease or something? You do look a bit cool. Can I touch you to see if you are slimy or not?&quot; <br />
Kyle got over him and gave hime his left hand, Martin put a fonger on it and felt the slimy skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Martin, come here, what kind of beer do you want?&quot; Becca asked. Martin escused himself and got out of the way to go meet Becca. Cassie was quick to replace him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...Kyle...hum, you look kind of hot!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh...why don&#39;t you meet behind the palmtrees in three minutes?&quot; she said with a wink.<br />
<br />
She pulled her phone out of her pocket and made a fake phone call to what she started talking and getting away,until she disappeared behind the palmtrees. Kyle couldn&#39;t believe that she was talking the truth. He swam to the toehr part of the pond and said something to Crystal just to fake it, she still gave him a cold shoulder. He swam back like a frog, feeling the good life of it. Looking around the greenhouse kind of looked like a zoo, and he was the atraction.<br />
&quot;At least I wouldn&#39;t have to study math like that&quot; he thougth to himself. The other girls were talking, Becca dn Sam were somehow being too friednly with Martin, but he took the shot and jumped out of the water. No one paid him any anttention and he kept leaping until he was behind the palmtrees. There was a corridor, boths sides had big plants and some trees blocking the view. Crystal was there without her shirt and bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like what you see?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s only answere was a &quot;ribbit&quot;, his eyes were fized on her boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. Don&#39;t you dare bragging baout this in school or telling the other girls&quot; she advised him. &quot;Can you lick them?&quot;<br />
His frog tongue flickered and accariciated her breasts. She closed her eyes and took the moment. Then they started to make out, she undressed her pants and underwear. He took of his bathing suit that could not hide his bulge. Crystal was undeniably hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...you&#39;re such a geek. But a cute geek!&quot; she laid down and opened her legs inviting him in.Kyle knew ho to do it for what he had seen but his new legs didn&#39;t let that position be that comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you know how to do it?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do...I mean I do it all the time...Just change your...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; He started to move her aorund until a good position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you squint?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like a frog?&quot; Crystal asked, with her back giving to him like a true frog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Kyle felt an instinct and hopped over her, thrusting her after. Crystal moaned with pleasure. Kyle couldn&#39;t believe he was loosing his virginity with that body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you a virgin?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore &quot; Kyle grinned as he thrusted her quicker. The sensation was great, he was certainly feeling like a man, or a frog male impregnating his first female to spread the genes and give continuation to the species.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m being screwed by a virgin frog!&quot; she gasped. He kept thrusting enjoying every movement in ecstasy. He was loosing it...finally! Crystal however colapsed to the floor. Kyle was quick to finish... he prefered to do it in the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I can&#39;t believe you are my first. I can&#39;t believe I fucked Crystal. How was I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh...I had worst and better for a first time&quot; she said, kind of regreting it. &quot;Not one single word, understood? Go in front, I&#39;ll appear later&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Kyle got in all fours and leaped out of the palm tree with a stupid smile on his face.  When he got out he was leaping towards the pond when he noticed that Martin was inside the water wearing a green wet suit. He looked at Sam, she was holding a tablet and devilish grin on her face. Martin looked totally unware about what was going to happen to him.<br />
<br />
Sam had told him she wanted to record someone swimming because she had a Health Class project and she was going to show how swimming is the best sport to be practiced as it involves almost every muscle in the human body, hence the green wet suit to excel the muscle movements. Somehow Martin agreed to do it, much to impress Becca. He was looking at her holding the tablet when a flash came out. He felt the wet suit becoming tigther and tigther, he closed his eyes because of the light and started to swim. But he stopped mid-way as the wet suit was tighing him so much, he opened his eyes and saw skin growing between his fingers forming a webbed hand. His feet had his toes growing apart one form the other and the same happened to them as it happened to his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening?&quot; he asked scared. The girls were giggling and laughing at him.<br />
<br />
 His skin was becoming all green, with some brown spots and dark green spot in his throat. A slimy and gooey substace was being segregated by his pores. Martin could feel it, sliding down his head, armpits and tights, like sweat after a good run. His muscles grew out, especially his chest pecs and at the end, for the coup de gras, instinctively he flcikered out his frog tongue in the air, like if there was a fly passing by. His hair, armpit hair (something Kyle was lacking) and goatee turned green too. Martin was trying to feel them with his new webbed flat hands.<br />
All the girls were looking at Martin, laughing and giggling at the boy. He looked himself in the water, looked at his hands and body and then at Kyle, squatting near the pond speechless. Sam had the same shit-eating grin in her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, they turned me into something like you&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thougth Kyle was lonely and he wanted a friend to play&quot; Sam said with a sassy mocking attitude.<br />
<br />
Martin looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you did the right thing. Dude, this is awsome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam stomped her foot on the ground, like a child on a tantrum.<br />
&quot;Urghhh...motherfu... Can&#39;t I just humilliate someone today?&quot;</p>
