<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Several months after Felix's body was transformed and he learned about the chronivac, he wanted to teach a lesson, himself.  His target, he told, Tony, Mark, Claire and Jack was Kyle Ferris.<br />
<br />
Claire clapped and cheered when Felix told them.  She hated Kyle Ferris.  Even though she was known throughout their high school as Tony's girlfriend, Kyle still made passes at her.  The first time, it shocked her.  She was in a science lab at a back table and he put his hand on hers and moved to stand an inch from her before smiling and asking her what she was doing that night.  She backed away.  He walked off to the other side of the room.  It was so quick and so out of character that she wondered if she'd mistaken him.  <br />
<br />
Kyle Ferris was a strikingly handsome boy, blond haired and green eyed, about Tony's height, six foot one and a bit less muscular, maybe 163 pounds.  He cultivated a good natured boy next door image.  If teachers had ever heard him curse they would have been shocked.  Parents also thought he was a squeaky clean boy whom they wanted around their own kids.<br />
<br />
But Claire talked to a couple other girls and found that her experience was not unique.  Opie Taylor turned out to be the ultimate player.  From averted glances and odd reticence in the way some girls reported their dealings with him, Claire inferred that Kyle Ferris had fucked them.  More than a few of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I warned my sister about him&quot; said Felix to the others.  &quot;But I don't think she believed me.  And he's a good looking guy.  I-I guess Tina was sort of flattered by the attention.  And he was so fucking smooth.  I-I was shocked.  I thought he was at least sort of like his image, but gahd!&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Claire demanded details.<br />
&quot;He came home with Tina three days ago&quot; -sigh- &quot;I-I didn't want to seem to bossy.  I figured Tina could handle herself but he was so fucking smooth, just amazing.  Always the perfect tone of voice, the perfect cajoling, the perfect gesture.  I-I would've done something else but I didn't think he'd . . he'd get in her pants, but-&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
Felix looked away.  &quot;He screwed my sister.  I saw it.  I was a-a fly on the wall.  Literally.  That was the day I had the chronivac.  I saw them coming up the walk and I wanted to know what was going on.  I figured he might get a kiss or something.  I figured I'd tell him off or something if he was going too fast.  So, I zapped myself into being a fly for a half hour.  It was so freaky at first, all my senses just completely scrambled.  My body felt so weird and I became so tiny.  It took me a minute to get the weird multi-lens eyesight right, too. But then I flew into her room and he was all over her.  She never really said 'no' but he was obviously pushing her to the point where she was a bit uncomfortable.  But he kept going.  A soft word here, a kiss there and she never stopped him.  Five minutes later, I couldn't believe it.  Kyle was fucking her.  I even flew down from the wall and buzzed his hair and his face.  I landed on his flat ass and crapped on him.  But I didn't matter.  I was this tiny fly.  I wish I'd done something to him.  Bastard.  You know what he said after he got up and started pulling up his pants?  Fifty one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fifty one?&quot; asked Claire.<br />
&quot;Yeah, fifty one, as in 'you're fuck number fifty one for me'.  &quot;<br />
&quot;Did he talk to her at all afterward?&quot; asked Claire.<br />
&quot;Nope.  Just . . fifty one and a smirk and then he was out the door.  Tina looked so hurt that he just saw her as a frigging number&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire told Felix and the others that this was the real Kyle and of speaking to enough other girls who told surprising stories of Kyle Ferris that she thought that 51 might be true.<br />
<br />
Kyle outlined his plan to the others and they agreed.  What's more, Claire helped him refine it.  She had seen the way Kyle Ferris looked at one particular girl.  Stacy Keller.  She was Kyle's greatest desire.  Stacy looked like supermodel Christy Turlington had in the George Michaels &quot;Freedom&quot; video.  Tall, slender, blond and with glowing skin like a Maxfield Parrish nymph.  Old men could scarcely take there eyes from her and if they didn't, they inevitably thought of holding her in their arms.  High school boys were awestruck.  <br />
<br />
But Stacy Keller was a very quiet girl.  She was from a very religious family and as near as anyone could tell was not allowed to date boys even though she was a sophomore in high school.  She'd been present at thousands of orgasms in the imaginations of masturbating boys, but never in the arms of one.<br />
<br />
Kyle had seen this luscious fruit, the greatest beauty of the school and turned on the good boy act even more.  She had such a reputation for unapproachability that twice he was alone with her in classrooms and made sure to never even hint at desiring her.  But nothing came of it.  She never spoke a word more to him than necesary in any situation.  <br />
<br />
But then that changed.  During spring vacation, he saw her at the mall.  And she smiled at him from the bookstore. She smiled!  She smiled!  Kyle's pulse raced and he thought he almost might have a hard-on.  He nearly hyperventilated trying to decide what to do next but finally just walked up to her.<br />
&quot;Gosh, aren't you contradicting evolution?&quot;<br />
&quot;How is that?&quot; she asked with an endearing smile looking up from her book.  <br />
&quot;Well, no creature is supposed to get everything, to get every advantage and here you are, just as pretty as can be and also smart enough to read . . &quot;<br />
He took the book from her hands.<br />
&quot; . . Nietzsche?  Gosh. That's too complex for me&quot;<br />
She smiled again.  &quot;Oh, I bet you're smarter than you're letting on.  I bet you're a lot of things that you don't let on about&quot;<br />
Kyle smiled his most endearing smile.  &quot;I hope you're nothing but what you appear to be&quot;<br />
But it didn't seem to work.  She fixed him in a serious stare.<br />
&quot;I am.  But I'm not sure what you are.  I can't be with a boy who doesn't actually love me.  I-I just can't.  I won't try and explain it.  So . . . what kind of boy are you?&quot;<br />
Kyle sputtered for a moment, caught off guard at being so directly confronted.  &quot;I-I'm that kind&quot;<br />
She smiled at him. &quot;We'll see.  Meet me at the movies tonight at 7&quot;.  Then she was off, out of the bookstore and walking briskly away from him.  At first Kyle just stood watching her go, watching the sweet sway of that luscious round ass but then started after her.  Contact with her had been so hard to get.  He couldn't let her go with just those few words.  <br />
<br />
She turned a corner down a little traveled mall branch hallway and was out of sight but Kyle started into a sprint after her.  He figured he'd catch her just a few strides but ran right into Felix Fairfax bent over tying his shoe and did a midair cartwheel before landing on his back.<br />
&quot;Damn it Felix!  You idiot!&quot;  Kyle scrambled to his feet looking around frantically but there was no one in sight.  Kyle cursed Felix again for having obstructed him.  He rubbed his chest.  &quot;Ow!&quot; Both sides were tender.  Standing up straight he also felt soreness he attributed to his landing on his not very muscular rear.  It felt swollen.<br />
<br />
Kyle Ferris went home and with every ounce of his will and every bit of shrewdness he possessed, plotted how he would approach Stacy Keller.  He never worked like this.  It was always so natural for him, the pursuit.  What a joy, the pursuit was.  <br />
<br />
This was different, almost overheated.  Kyle laughed to himself.  &quot;This must be almost what it's like when one of those fall in love idiots actually hits the jackpot&quot;.  Though he regarded masturbation as being for losers, he indulged a little self love imagining giving Stacy Keller a whole lot of love.<br />
<br />
When he met her hours later he still felt overheated about the whole thing.  His butt still felt sore, swollen though it didn't show under his loose fit jeans.  His chest was still sore, too.  Somehow running into Felix Fairfax had bruised his chest under both nipples.  He was sore and swollen under both to the point that it would've looked odd under a dress shirt.  Luckily, his t-shirt and untucked floral print hid things quite nicely.  Kyle tapped his foot scanning the parking lot outside the mall theaters for her.  He looked at his reflection in one of the glass doors to make sure he looked right.  He smiled at the image.  Had his skin ever looked better?  Even his lips seemed somehow fuller.  <br />
&quot;Hmmph&quot; he sniffed softly.  &quot;Hope it fools her&quot;<br />
<br />
And suddenly, there she was, the incandescent Stacy Keller.  Kyle tried to kiss her as they said hello and wanted to kick himself after she turned away.  <br />
&quot;Silly!&quot; she laughed &quot;I don't know you well enough.  I told you.  I can't ever be with a boy who doesn't love me&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe I do&quot; protested Kyle.<br />
<br />
She shook her head skeptically but got into line with him to buy tickets.  Kyle did all the talking or almost all of it.  He bought tickets to a movie that was sort of a chick flick.  Stacy professed surprise that Kyle could understand the appeal of a movie like that but he said he thought he could.  Part way through the movie, he got to hold her hand.  She demanded a declaration of sincerity of affection first and he gave it.  <br />
<br />
Kyle was surprised.  Just holding this girl's hand made him feel an electric shock.  And his mind was swirling as he did.  What was this feeling?  It was so amazing and inexplicable.  He hated to be apart from her for even a moment, but that fall in the mall must've been worse than he'd thought because he simply couldn't bear to sit on his ass in those movie seats any longer.  Halfway through, he got up with the excuse of going to the bathroom.  He went to the men's room to cover his story.  There, he rubbed his swollen ass.  His buns felt twice as big as his flat glutes usually did.  But, hey, she might like that.  He felt his chest and let out a yelp in the echo chamber of the tiled room.  &quot;Holy shit!&quot;  On each side of his chest it felt like a tangerine half had been squeezed under his nipple.  Kyle took a deep breath.  He thought of her perky round breasts under her dress.  What a delightful prospect to look forward to.<br />
<br />
He went back to the movie and though it was almost sickeningly melodramatic, he actually found himself crying like a chick at the stupid thing, to his own amazement.  But it seemed to please her somehow as she smiled at the sight of Kyle's tears.  He leaned forward and kissed her lips muttering something about the movie.<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she whispered to him.  &quot;Not unless it's true love.  I can't be with a boy who doesn't love me&quot;<br />
&quot;But I do!&quot; Kyle protested and this seemed to mollify her.  She turned to watch the film but continued to hold his hand.  <br />
<br />
When the movie ended, Kyle jumped to his feet.  He just had to get his swollen butt off that seat.  But he felt so oddly off balance he almost fell over.  He immediately grabbed for her hand and led her out of the theater.  He suggested that they go to his house.  He didn't tell her that his parents would be away for a few more hours.  She agreed.  <br />
<br />
Compared to his other seductions, this was like the touch of a paintbrush compared to the action of a bulldozer.  Every word was a light and pleasant touch.  Every syllable was affection and most of all fidelity.  Eventually even the unapproachable Stacy Keller, most beautiful girl alive was melting.  They reached his home and he led her to the front door.  Inside, he immediately kissed her on the mouth.  She pushed him back.<br />
&quot;I told you! I-&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. I know.  You can't be with a boy who doesn't love you.  Well you are!&quot;<br />
Kyle said it in a deep, resonant whisper looking her straight in the eye.  She never said yes.  She never said she wanted to.  But she looked him right in the eyes as deeply as possible and smiled.  <br />
<br />
Kyle led her up the stairs to his room and shut the door behind them.  He immediately pressed his mouth to hers and started taking off her clothes.  He scarcely noticed that she was now almost the same height as he was.  He laid her down on the bed and started feverishly kissing her beautiful round breasts.  He tore the remainder of her clothes off her and kissed her all over, even spreading her outer lips with two fingers and extending his tongue inside her.  He tore off his own clothes, smiling at her all the while and climbed atop her.  He felt so weird but attributed it to the extreme desire he had for her.  <br />
<br />
It would all be right with the first thrust.  He always felt that way.  The first thrust into each new conquest united the whole universe, sewed all loose ends together and made everything fit.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked into her eyes.  What was that expression?  So odd.  He reared back with his still swollen feeling rear and thrust forward.<br />
<br />
And nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-?&quot;<br />
Kyle rocked back and thrust forward as hard as he could.  This time he at least made contact with her at the crotch but something was wrong.  It didnt feel wet and soft around him.  It felt wet and hairy against him.  <br />
&quot;What the-?&quot;  Kyle lifted himself up on his elbows to look down the length of their bodies.  What he saw shocked him.  He saw two lithe female bodies joined at the hip, outer lips and bush pressed tight against outer lips and bush.  <br />
<br />
Kyle jumped off the bed.<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; he shouted.  He wanted to say more but was shocked at the feminine pitch of his voice.<br />
&quot;I . . I'm a chick!?  What-what'd you do to me?!&quot;<br />
Kylie frantically rubbed her hands over her new flat crotch, big round breasts and hourglass shaped torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!  You lied to me!  You lied to me!  This is what you get!&quot;<br />
&quot;What-what do you mean?&quot; pleaded a tearful Kylie Ferris staring at her exotic dancer's body in the mirror.<br />
&quot;I told you!  I can't be with a boy who doesn't love me!  It's a family curse.  Any boy I'm . . with, any boy I love who doesn't love me doesn't stay a boy&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you-you took my cock away.  I don't have a penis.  I . . &quot;<br />
Ultra player Kylie Ferris slumped to the carpet in front of his mirror looking at the knockout blond he'd become, shoulder length platinum hair cascading over her shoulders and cried. <br />
&quot;You've got to turn me back&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't have to do anything.  I'm not sure I would even if I could but I don't know how to.  Now do you see why I didn't encourage boys?&quot;<br />
But Kylie Ferris was so despondent she wasn't much listening, just staring at the new female reality of her body.<br />
<br />
Stacy Keller gave a swat to her full round rear.  <br />
&quot;Get up.  It's not so bad.  There are tons of beautiful boys.  Think of Tony St. Martin.  You've seen him naked lots of times I bet.  Isn't he delicious?&quot;<br />
Kyle couldn't help but recall changing next to Tony St. Martin and thinking of that round rumped, fat free swimmer's body, Kylie felt her new female sexual responses.<br />
&quot;Oh god!  I'm a chick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Over a period of a couple minutes, Kylie gradually regained her resolve and got to her feet.  She turned and grabbed Stacy by the shoulders.  Her breasts swung out from her chest and slapped Stacy in the process.<br />
&quot;Oh shit.  I can't stay like this.  There must be some way.  What did you say this is, a curse?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.  It's a curse.  My mother explained it to me.  Generations ago, someone in my family treated a gypsy woman like just a conquest, just a notch in his belt.&quot;<br />
She watched Kylie look embarassedly to one side.<br />
&quot;She cursed our family so that we can't ever have sex if we aren't truly in love or we do things like this to our partners&quot;<br />
&quot;But-but is there some way out of this?  I-I want my cock back.  I want to be what I was&quot;<br />
&quot;You want to be a liar?&quot;<br />
&quot;I . . .&quot;<br />
&quot;That's what you were.  I asked you a half dozen times and you could have admitted the truth at any time but you kept professing to love me.  There's one way out but I don't think you could do it.  So just-&quot;<br />
Kylie shook her shoulders.  &quot;There's a way out of this!?  Tell me!&quot;<br />
&quot;You'll never be able to do it.  So don't bother about it&quot;<br />
&quot;TELL ME!!&quot;<br />
Slowly Stacy spelled it out for Kylie.  She could only return to being male by vowing with all her heart to only love with complete sincerity.  She explained that any future slipup would immediately transform her from male back to this body again, for good.  Kylie vowed her complete dedication to these principles.  She closed her eyes, trying to make the transformation happen right there.  But when she opened them a half minute later she had not changed at all.<br />
<br />
Stacy laughed.  &quot;You thought you would just right there change your ways in just a moment?&quot;  She laughed some more.  &quot;How many girls have you just used as penis receptacles then discarded like used tissues afterward?&quot;<br />
Kylie almost cried.  &quot;Fifty, um, fifty one&quot;<br />
Stacy slapped Kylie.  &quot;Oh my god.  What a jackass player you've been!  Why don't you just put your clothes on and think about all the girls you fucked and then tossed away.  You probably haven't really admitted to yourself how bad you were to them.  Maybe if you appreciate that you'll change back.  I doubt you're up to it&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie was apologetic now and listlessly pulled on her old male clothes feeling freakish with her full round ass and pendulous breasts squeezed into her old slender 17 year old boy's clothes.<br />
<br />
Stacy dressed in her clothes.  &quot;I'm going to leave now.  If you can return to being a boy and stay one, then maybe you're not such an asshole.  But even if you do, I don't want to talk to you again&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy left.  Kylie was sitting on the edge of her bed, disconsolate at the unvarnished recollections of how she'd treated those 51 girls.  An hour after Stacy left, Kyle's parents returned.  Kylie quickly closed the bedroom door and avoided any contact with them.<br />
<br />
Out in the Ferris yard, Felix Fairfax, back to his 6'1&quot; 170 pound male body after his hours as 5'8&quot; 120 pound Stacy Keller watched along with Claire as they continued to scan Kylie.  They were watching for her to make some kind of motion indicating that she was again making a vow to mend her ways.  Finally, after a lot of aimless wallowing on her bed, they saw her look upward and then close her eyes.  Felix looked at Claire and nodded.  She nodded back.  <br />
<br />
In her room, Kylie felt an electric wave pass through her as she was silently vowing to change.  <br />
<br />
Immediately, she felt her full, female ass narrowing and her breasts diminishing.  She lost her hourglass shape and she added muscle to her shoulders, shoulders no longer touched by her hair.  Finally, she looked down and saw her vagina reshaping into Kyle's penis and scrotum.<br />
<br />
Kyle jumped to the mirror and let out a sigh of relief.  He looked up.  &quot;I will.  I'll be a different person&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire looked patted Felix's shoulder.  &quot;Nice going racy Stacy&quot;</p>
