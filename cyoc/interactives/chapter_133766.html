<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Anija and Vracka mated, the rest of the crew woke up, Karyu woke up pleasently suprised as he saw his rider dressing herself up, taking a short glance at her glorious back, Luka turned around, wearing her beautiful tunic, Karyu gave a suprised look as he saw the belly of his rider being much larger than before, he slowly went towards Luka, slightly pressing his head against her belly, Karyu didn&#39;t just feel Luka&#39;s hearbeat, no... He felt two more heartbeats resonating from within her belly, &quot;Two.&quot; said Karyu suddenly, &quot;Huh?&quot; asked Luka, being caught by suprise as she heared her dragon, &quot;You&#39;re gonna give birth to two children.&quot; said Karyu with a gulp, by hearing this Luka gulped aswell as she fell into her knees near a wall, pressing her back against it, Karyu quickly went towards her giving a small whimper as he felt the sorrow of his rider, Luka was in thoughts, maybe giving birth to a child wouldn&#39;t be painful, but two?! She heared countless stories on how women died while delivering children, she was scared both from her own life and the life of her children, &quot;Luka...&quot; started Karyu, as he looked deeply in Luka&#39;s beautiful green eyes, who looked back into the dragon&#39;s beautiful bronze eyes, &quot;Luka, i promise you will be fine, the healers of the kingdom are experienced.&quot; said Karyu, attempting to cheer up his rider, Luka eventually nodded in agreement, she looked at her dragon with a smile, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go see if the rest of the crew woke up.&quot; said Luka as she and Karyu left their home.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Avelia woke up, her honey colored hair almost in a complete mess, she stretched as she got up, usually Vracka would be the one waking her up, but this time was an exception as Vracka was with Anija, engaged in their intercourse, this was the same problem with Vaestro, who was sleeping in the room right next to Avelia&#39;s one, both of them prepared themselves as they went towards the castle.<br />
<br />
A few minutes have passed, Luka and her dragon barelly entered the guest room, where Avelia,Vaestro and their dragons were waiting for her, Avelia quickly gasped as she saw Luka, &quot;Did you two...&quot; started Avelia, being quickly intrerupted by Luka, &quot;Yep, we did it, just last night.&quot; said Luka, with a relaxed voice, &quot;Last night?!&quot; said Vaestro with suprise in his voice, &quot;Yeah... Is there something wrong?&quot; asked Luka with again, a relaxed voice, &quot;Quite a few things actually!&quot; replied Vaestro, &quot;First of all, you just fucked a dragon.&quot; started Vaestro, &quot;And second you look like you&#39;re gonna give birth today!&quot;  finished Vaestro, &quot;Drake-seed is quite unique.&quot; said Anija suddenly, &quot;Unlike natural human seed, the newborn develops in the uterus much faster if a female human is exposed to it.&quot; finished Anija, this made Avelia stare at Vracka, &quot;So you&#39;re saying that i&#39;m gonna have to expect about five to six eggs from Vracka?&quot; asked Avelia, by hearing this Vracka&#39;s scaly visage instantly got a tone of red, she quickly looked away from her rider as she bit her scaly lip nervously, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that i have to say yes.&quot; said Anija as he blushed slightly, &quot;There might be even more.&quot; finished Anija as he looked down in emberassment, Vracka remembered the amazing feeling of Anija being coiled around her feminine body, she loved feeling his dragonhood  in her slit and lastly, the feeling she had when Anija injected buckets of his seed in her womb made her feel great, &quot;Luckily, the development in hens is much slower.&quot; said Anija with an honest voice, &quot;So i can still take Vracka to the exploration.&quot; said Avelia, she was quickly replied with a nod from Anija, &quot;Woah, what exploration?&quot; asked Luka, as she tilted her head slightly, &quot;Adam said that some of his scouts found an island, it wasn&#39;t controlled by the cultists but they didn&#39;t have enough time to fully explore it, so Adam sent us to fully explore it.&quot; said Vaestro, &quot;But considering your current condition, i don&#39;t think you will be capable of exploring it with us.&quot; said Anija, at first Luka wanted to protest, but Vaestro&#39;s drake was right, she couldn&#39;t go in that island, the fact that she had two newborns in her belly made her reflexes and speed severly lowered, plus the possible hazards inside the island could threaten her life and the life of her newborns.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want, i can remain here with you.&quot; Said Karyu as he nuzzled his rider, &quot;No, you can go with them if you want to.&quot; said Luka, with a honest voice, she didn&#39;t want to restrict her dragon&#39;s actions, plus some of the royal guards followed her when she reached the castle, they were most likely ordered by Adam to take care of her incase she gives birth, although it did feel claustrophobic for Luka, safety measures must be taken, and to noble people such as Luka, those measures are harshly increased, &quot;See you Luka, be strong.&quot; said Avelia as she and the rest of the crew left, now Luka stood there, with two royal guards watching over her as she took small sips from a cup filled with water.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed and the crew was flying towards the island, unlike most of the times, the entire crew was together and noticeably silent, a few coughs and yawns broke the silence sometimes, but most of the time it was completly silent, as if no one was aboard the airship, &quot;Hm...&quot; said Anija as he broke the silent, &quot;What&#39;s wrong my angel?&quot; asked Vaestro as he crossed his arms, &quot;By just getting nearer the island i can feel an unknown form of magic resonating from it.&quot; said Anija, eastern dragons such as him had a fine affinity with magic, they could detect a mage or an enchanted item from insane distances, while also being capable of telling if that form of magic is harmful,innocent or beneficent. &quot;Is it harmful?&quot; Asked Karyu, &quot;No, but it&#39;s not beneficent either.&quot; replied Anija, &quot;It&#39;s not from a person, it&#39;s from an item.&quot; finished Anija, most of the crew smiled in excitement, all except Karyu, rarely does the crew find objects that are enchanted with a rare form of magic.<br />
<br />
Eventually the airship landed and the crew left the airship, just as Anija lef the ship, he quickly laid one of his forepaws on the ground, most eastern dragons did it to determine if the effects of the magics surrounding the area affected dragons or humans, while doing this, Anija&#39;s eyes seemed to constantly create an aura of magic, after a few seconds, Anija retreated his paw from the ground, &quot;The magic affects dragons.&quot; said Anija, at first Avelia and Vaestro wanted to send their dragons back in the airship, but they thought that the effects of the object emenating from the area wouldn&#39;t completly harm their dragons, they decided to let the dragons come with them.<br />
<br />
Little did Vaestro and Avelia know that the effects of the touch of the object in case didn&#39;t harm their dragons, no, it would change them physicaly, keeping the form of the certain dragon but maybe switching the gender and changing the species into a much more powerful and rare species of dragon.<br />
<br />
Now... Which dragon was lucky or unlucky enough to find the object and be affected by it?</p>
