<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“HARDER FASTER!”<br />
Rose screamed as she was being mounted by a male anthro shire horse fury. His mottled equine phallus stretching the entrance of the female anthro Burmese Python fury. Pistoning himself deeper in the warm tight tunnel; he can sense his climax building as the telltale feeling of his cock head flaring. The imposing black fured horse fury roughly yanks the female tight to him as bellows out a cry of relief. Rose moans and whimpers as she feels the massive shaft pump an impressive volume of cum into her; already full from the buffet, Rose begins to feel bloated as her stomach distends. The massive amount of cum coming from the shire horse fury stretching her womb, while a bit trickles out from her plugged up scaly lips.<br />
<br />
“You already look fit to burst,” Michael Proudhoof chuckling as Rose pants from the massive tool in her still pumping; “and it looks like you will once Carlos pulls out.”<br />
“Such a load,” someone in the back commenting; “he must have been backed up for a bit.”<br />
“More like eager to ruin a tight cunt for the rest of us,” Jake snorting; his quip earning him a playful slap from Brittany as she too wonders if she could fit that massive rod in her.<br />
“Hush,” Michael admonishing his son as he and everyone watch as Carlos slowly pulls out; his massive phallus already looking flaccid as it dangles lazily in front of his fury sack. Coated in his  juices as well as Rose’s; the horse furry takes a few steps back as Rose collapses on to the floor. Everyone stares as Rose moans; her entrance already leaking out Carlos’s cum, some murmured as they wondered if the load that was pushed into her distended womb would stay in or also slowly flow out. No one had to wait long as the Burmes Python fury slowly stood up; using a nearby chair to help steady herself; gravity soon provided an assist as Rose felt an uncontrollable flow from deep within her. Reminiscent of her monthly periods when she was human; she knew she was going to leak and the flow would be heavy and hard.<br />
<br />
“Someone fetch a bucket,” Rose moaning; “or there is going to be a mess made.”<br />
“Don’t worry about it,” Michael chuckling; looking as a few of the servers along with their mates were already making their own messes, the sounds of their moaning and fury flesh slapping fury flesh. “Yours won’t be the only made,” Michael adding; watching as Rose’s snake like face look relieved as the copious amount of cum in her starts to flow out, creating rivers of creaming white down her inner thighs.<br />
<br />
Allison sighed as she turned around to see her mate Jimmy passed on a table. The anthro stag-deer fury hitting the egg nog a bit too hard; was looking quite inebriated when he decided to fashion himself a crown of mistletoe. Walking around the restaurant getting everyone to kiss him as he sported a massive hard on; Allison had to drag him to the table he is now passed out on and give him a hand-paw job. After he blew his load all over Alison’s fury paws he smiled and asked if she could drive home before passing out.<br />
“Its not even ten in the evening,” Jake looking at his twin brother passed out on a table; his head resting on a puddle of drool. “And my brother is partied out,” Jake trying to wake the passed out fury up with no success.<br />
“Can you help me put him in the car,” the pregnant cougar fury looking at Jake; “as much as I would hate to stay I think it is best we head home.”<br />
<br />
Jake nodded as he and Brittany helped to hoist the sleepy stag-deer fury to his hooves. Opting to drag him out the door while Alison approached Michael and told him it was time for her and Jimmy to leave. She catches up to her bff and mate to see them sniggering as they manage to stuff Jimmy into the back seat of the car. Getting closer, Alison shakes her head at Brittany’s juvenile stunt; seeing Jimmy’s fur magically dyed and branded with an assortment of slogans and symbols.<br />
“Very mature of you,” Alison rolling her eyes as she slowly gets into the driver’s seat. She was surprised to see Brittany head over to the passenger seat while Jake managed to make room and sit next to his passed out brother in the back.<br />
<br />
“Did you not forget that you are our ride,” Brittany giggling; the anthro wolf fury slurring her words slightly as she too went a little hard on the egg nog that Jimmy prepared. Alison was unable to drink any as she was five months pregnant and the eggnog was massively spiked with rum.<br />
“Fine,” Alison nodding; remembering the quick agreement made earlier as she was tucking into the lamb chops and more crab Rangoon at the buffet table earlier. “But you’re sleeping it off at our house.”<br />
“Works for us,” Jake smiling; unseen to Alison in the rearview mirror, the anthro stag-deer fury was fondling his fury balls.<br />
<br />
Back at the party, Denise was panting as the anthro lion fury raked her tunnel with his barbed cock; the fury spent most of his time working the lunch rush as a line cook, so the anthro tigress barely had a chance to get to know the regal looking fury. Currently she was getting an intimate chance to talk to the well-endowed male; however her more baser urges took control of her decision making abilities and was soon having him hilt her. The sensation of feeling his barbed penis twitching inside of her and feeling a warm liquid fill her up. She already had multiple orgasms prior to his thanks to his rod; but she still wanted a final crescendo and felt denied as the lion fury pulled out and collapsed on the floor exhausted from the act.<br />
<br />
Heading towards her mate, tail twitching as her nether leaked cum; unconcerned of the sight she was presenting as she discovered Michael helping the Burmese Python fury she met earlier to a chair.<br />
“Fuck me,” Rose finally calmed down from her rut; “that was the best lay I’ve had in a while.”<br />
“I’m still eager for more,” Denise sauntering up to her mate; placing a hand paw on his package and encouraging his shaft to come out and play.<br />
“Later love,” Michael gently removing her paw from his sheath; “plenty of that to be had, but right now I need to usher everyone home as it looks like everyone is getting exhausted.”<br />
Denise pouts as she heads to a table that still looks relatively clean; taking a seat on a nearby chair she watches as her mate begin to shake everyone’s paw. Watching him help a few still addled from sex to get up and encourage them to head home while they have the chance. It took a few minutes before they were the last, save for Rose along with Carlos who was helping the new waitress out the door.<br />
<br />
“Well it looks like we have a newly bonded pair of mates,” Michael smiling as he observes Carlos the Shire horse fury, place a massive hoof hand on Rose’s rear end. The lack of resistance from the python fury as she leaned her head on his massive chest while the two walked out just as the snow began to fall. “We better get going if we don’t want to be stuck here,” Michael looking at his mate.<br />
“It was a hell of a Christmas party,” Denise looking at the mess that was made; “It’s going to be a hell of a mess to clean up.”<br />
“That is a tomorrow problem,” Michael locking up the front door before walking with Denise to the back entrance; already feeling her paws all over his body as he sets the alarm and heads out the back door into the cold brisk evening. Exhaling while feeling the crunch of snow on his hooves; Michael takes a brief moment to look at the snow fall and notices it is going to be intense. “We might not make it home,” Michael locking the back door; “perhaps we should head over to Jimmy or Edward’s place as they are closure.”<br />
“Our daughter Roxy is at Edwards,” Denise’s sexual appetite temporarily abated at the thought of her daughter; if we stay at Jimmy’s we might have an evening romp together.”<br />
“You naughty kitty,” Michael using a nickname he gave to Denise after revealing to the world that she created and released an airborne variant of fury virus into the atmosphere; turning humans into furies and putting the world into a state of anarchy and upheaval. “all that rutting and you are still not satiated.”<br />
“Drive,” Denise grinning at her mate as she climbs into the passenger seat of Michael’s car; making a mental note to pick up her car tomorrow assuming the snow doesn’t bury it in the parking lot.<br />
<br />
The drive to Jimmy and Alison’s house took a little longer than usual; with the snow coming down hard, the roads were becoming difficult to drive on. Nearly fish tailing and losing control, Michael was forced to drive at near idle as noticed the plows have yet to begun to clear the roads. Pulling up into the driveway of Jimmy’s house, the two furies step out of the vehicle to see the snow looking thick and heavy on the ground.<br />
“I think we made the wise choice,” as Michael follows Denise to the front door; noticing how big her paw prints are in the snow compared to his cervine like hooves. It wasn’t long before the porch light comes on and Alison has the front door open.<br />
“I thought we bring the party here,” Michael looking at his daughter in law as they enter; taking a moment to wipe his hooves while Denise does the same, he explains to a tired looking cougar fury that they didn’t want to get snowed in and worry over their daughter who is next door.<br />
“It is coming down hard,” Alison nodding; “news predicts at least two feet of snow by morning.”<br />
“That looks about right as they enter towards the living room to see Jake and Brittany already in the middle of a wild rut. Brittany riding Jake as the anthro stag-deer lies on the floor while Brittany is on top, their hips bucking as Brittany’s breasts bounce and sway. Being lead to the guest bedroom, Alison soon explained that the moment Jake and Brittany help to toss Jimmy on the bed they ran straight downstairs and started to have fun.<br />
<br />
“You know we are going to have fun,” Denise letting a toothy grin slip through her tiger muzzle; “just letting you know and all that.”<br />
“And don’t be surprised if a tiny critter decides to snuggle with you,” Alison looking to see where Dickens is; the Siamese seal point cat with chocolate paws and blue eyes soon disappeared once he had his snack after Alison and all came home. “He loves to snuggle,” Alison seeing the cat in question come towards her as Michael starts to guide Denise to the bed; eager to finish the horny tigress fury off and get some sleep.<br />
“Come here Dickens,” Alison picking up Jimmy J.R’s cat and taking him with her to the master bedroom; “you can torment Jimmy as he sleeps off his rummy egg nog concoctions.”<br />
Getting a short squawk from the cat followed by a loud purr as Alison closes the bedroom door and places the cat on the bed. She turns off the television as does her best to snuggle with the prone stag-deer fury that was lying face down on the bed. Having her positions lying on the bed limited thanks to her baby bump, she settles for curling up next to Jimmy while Dickens chooses to get close to the cougar fury and curls up next to her crotch; placing a hand paw on the fury critter, Alison gently stokes the cat all the while listening to Brittany’s scream of orgasmic joy and the moaning coming from the guest bedroom.</p>
