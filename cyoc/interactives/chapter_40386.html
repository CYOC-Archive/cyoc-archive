<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stretched as I woke from my sleep.  Yawning, I criticized the website, &quot;Endless energy, yeah right.  I shouldn't have to sleep like this.&quot;  It did not feel like I had been out for very ling, maybe only ten minutes.  <br />
 <br />
I rolled over, feeling warm and comfortable in my new fur.  There was an unusual heavy feeling in my nether regions that surprised me.  I looked down to investigate and saw something that made my jaw drop.  During my brief nap, unknown to me, my privates had continued to grow.  The sheath that I had acquired when I turned into a werewolf looked like a tube sock crammed to the seams with meat.  And my balls, well they were two cosmic orbs that hung from my body, pulsing with every beat of my heart.<br />
<br />
I felt the unnaturally intense sexual rage that I had placed over myself take control.  My dick swelled inside my sheath and peeked out.  My head was enormous, it pushed itself out of my sheath with a pleasant 'flumb'.  I felt my heart rate as my excitement mounted, my dick kept getting longer and thicker.  It was amazing how acute my sense of touch had grown in my dick, I could actually feel the blood pumping into it and filling it up, and it felt good.<br />
<br />
Transfixed on my dick, I got up and let out a moan of pleasure as my balls dragged against my bed and swung off to hang freely just above my knees.  They were big, really big.  Laying down, I hadn't accurately judged their size.  I took one in each hand, my ball sack loose enough to let me hold them apart from one another.  I shivered, each one was just bigger than a grapefruit and throbbing with vitality.  I took a deep breath, to dispel the sexual rage that was building, and picked up my tape measure.  My dick already seemed bigger than it had been a moment ago, I stretched the tape measure out, it read 15.75 inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;3 inches in 10 minutes, I like how this is going.&quot;  I growled.  I was amazed, the last time I was this big I was hating life.  But now I was in a different body, and my cock was still amazingly proportionate to the rest of my body.  I looked down at my balls, I noticed that they were hanging heavier and heavier as I continued to examine myself.  <br />
I placed both my hands on my cock, unable to wrap one around all the way.  Suddenly my skin got goosebumps, and I felt myself getting a little shorter.  My cock went limp once I realized that I was changing back.  I quickly moved over to my computer, wincing as my balls bounced painfully up and down when I didn't step gingerly enough.  I stopped the change and changed back, not setting a timer this time.  &quot;That was unpleasnt,&quot; I thought, &quot;well, as long as I'm at the computer...&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned as I dialed up some more changes, first more productive balls, then more muscles, increased penis growth rate, a little taller, and finally I mad myself even hornier.  I pressed start, anticipating the changes, and relishing in their happening.  My muscles pumped up, swelling and pulling at my skin.  At the same time I grew taller, my perspective of my room changed, everything got smaller.  I readjusted my feet for my new stature and to allow more room for my balls to hang.  I enjoyed it so much that I made myself another foot taller.  With my new stature, my dick didn't look as big as it did 5 minutes ago, I measured it again, it was 18 inches now, but it didn't seem very big now.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't have that I said&quot;, loosing myself to the changes.  I made myself hornier, made my dick bigger and made my muscles as big as they could go.  I hit the start button, expecting something tame to happen, but I was so wrong.  With a jolt my muscles exploded in size.  My already well defined pecks grew to the bursting limit, pushing so far out, I couldn't see my balls anymore, which by the way I had let go unnoticed for the past while.  I felt each ab expand until they were visible underneath my fur.  My biceps and calves grew until each was a huge ball of flesh.  My back became ribbed with great balloons of muscle and my shoulders spread far apart to accommodate even more muscle.<br />
<br />
I looked at my new form, it was beautiful.  But... I could hardly move!  I felt my beyond massive pecs, the deep crevice between them.  I tried to touch my back, but couldn't get my hand past the side of my hip, there was too much resistance from my muscles, I tried to lift my arm above my head, but couldn't either.  I took a step, actually having trouble moving.  I lost balance and fell to the floor with a bang.  My balls hit the floor with a whap.  I yelped in pain.  I had fallen on my penis, I found my self in agony.  I got up on all fours and crawled to my computer.  I carefully reversed the changes and almost dozed off again.  Moving around with these massive muscles was tiring to do.  My muscles slowly shrank down, when I could move properly again I stopped them.<br />
<br />
I shuddered again, they were still more than massive than massive, but I was mobile, and I could see my junk.  I found my tape measure, and measured my dick.  &quot;22 inches... its perfect.&quot;  I said, moving my attention to my balls.  &quot;Shit,&quot; I said.  They were hanging below my knees, together they were as big as a basketball.  I touched my dick, now so erect that many veins were popping out, and came a little.</p>
