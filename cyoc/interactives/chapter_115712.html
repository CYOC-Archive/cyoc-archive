<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well who do we have here, huh how did you get in here?&quot; Mindy asks as she cautiously approaches Brian. In the twenty plus years working with dogs she is not phased easily by surprise stray dogs, but to find one in her office when she was sure she locked the door was still a bit alarming. Either way though this oddly shaped husky looking dog was here and she needed to first asses if it was a friendly dog or if she might need to take action. <br />
*Meanwhile happening inside the now furry body of Brian.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Oh shit shit shit, this is happening.&quot; Brian thought as he began to process what&#39;s happening now. With his new dog hormones and instincts clouding his judgement his processing speeds and human higher thinking was slowed. &quot;Mindy its me Brian, this watch I&#39;m wearing turned me it a Dog, it&#39;s me Brian, Mindy can you hear me.&quot; All that came from his mouth was a different variety of yips and cries at different pitches. &quot;My aren&#39;t you a vocal critter&quot; Mindy chuckles as she stepped closer into the office. &quot;Why didn&#39;t I plan ahead for this, of course Mindy would come up to the Kennel today, it&#39;s Tuesday, she&#39;s open. Shit, I was so damn excited and eager to test out this new watch that I didn&#39;t plan ahead on this. Mindy&#39;s always been sweet to new dogs and favorites huskies, but still she must thinks I&#39;m some stray mutt.&quot;. Brian kept starring at Mindy, her voice came out slightly distorted and deeper, but still understandable. &quot;So how did you get in here boy, oh um you are a boy right.&quot; Mindy tilts her head to glance down at Brian&#39;s furry manhood and nods her head. If dogs faces could turn red, Brian&#39;s check would be bright rosy. He looked down at his manhood as well and Mindy let out a deep laugh. &quot;Great now my former boss is checking out my junk, this is all I need.&quot; He turns his head and glances over at the pile of clothes he left behind and flung during the transformation. &quot;I kinda wish I had on my shirt now, at least to cover up my embarrassment.&quot; No realizing it While Brian was in his own inner monologue. Mindy has crossed through the office gate, pulled out a slip on leash and was within a foot of Brian&#39;s head. Suddenly out of the fogginess of his brain, Brian came up with a plan. &quot;Wait a second, that&#39;s it! Maybe I can try and communicate with her using my phone in my pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
       Suddenly something inside Brian&#39;s brain distracted him as a new smell hit his nose. &quot; &quot;Hey boy, would you like a doggy treat, huh?&quot; Mindy asked as she pulled a milkbone dog treat from her pocket. She knelt down to Brian&#39;s eye level. Even at his level, she was still bigger than him. He still felt a little scared and intimidated by the size difference. When you used to being 6&#39;2&quot; tall is not a common feeling, suddenly being smaller in size and weight to someone who is only 5&#39;3&quot; is not a feeling you typically feel. Still staring at the clothes with one eye. Brian out of reflex turned his head in the direction of the treat. &quot;What is happening to me, I can&#39;t stop myself, I need to reach my phone, but ohhh does the treat smell good. I think it&#39;s chicken scent I&#39;m smelling, I got to see what that tastes like. But hold on a second I need my pho.&quot; Brian tried to fight the urge to sniff the treat, but he sooner gave in. Munch, munch, munch, this treat is Awesome! The chicken tastes so strong now!&quot; Brian soon began to salivate and drool drip down from his open mouth. He continued to munch away at the treat as he he could see out of the corner of his eye, Mindy walk away, but a metallic object shinning in her hand. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it. Mindy was going to trick me! What&#39;s worst is I didn&#39;t even see it coming, what&#39;s happening to me?&quot; Brian began to worry some as he continued to eat the treat and start to almost uncontrollably lick the crumbs off the floor. <br />
<br />
        &quot;That&#39;s it good boy!&quot; Mindy said has she let The dog lick the treat off her hand. She was about to slip the leash on the furry husky, but something caught her eye in the corner of the room. A slightly stretched purple v neck t shirt. She then stood up leaving the dog to lick the crumbs off the floor as she walked over to pick up the shirt. &quot;Wait a sec, I know who owns this shirt, my neighbor Brian! That makes sense now, Brian must have you dropped you off here know that I would take you boy. That&#39;s weird he didn&#39;t call but typical boys.&quot; Mindy laughed again as she looked down on Brian still licking up crumbs.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Oh my gosh, this treat is flipping amazing, I&#39;ve never tasted such rich chicken before in my life!&quot; Brian couldn&#39;t help himself has he continued to lick the crumbs from the floor. God knows how many dogs have walked, peed, thrown up, or people walk through there in that particular spot, but Brian didn&#39;t care. He was zoned out in a whole other world now. All the while Mindy kept starring down at this white and Grey male husky. He looked physically like a pure bred Siberian husky. He did seem kind of off though she thought &quot;he&#39;s frame is slightly skinner than most male huskies and coat and nails look to healthy to be a strays. Plus he teeth are way no white, like puppies, but he&#39;s at least 3 or 4. He&#39;s definitely a strange mutt, but he&#39;s still cute and homeless I guess.&quot; Mindy knelt down again to look at the husky eye level. Brian still was licking the now spotless clean spot in the floor. Still trying to pick up any overlooked crumbs. &quot;Well this was s surprise, wait till I get a hold of that kid, but in the mean time I have a kennel full of hungry animals who believe it&#39;s still breakfast time. So what am I going to do with you mutt, huh boy&quot;?&quot; Mindy asked aloud as she reached out a hand to rub Brian&#39;s head. The contact at first started Brian and he jumped up from his licking trance and stared back at Mindy who was again on his level. Mindy flinched her hand back for a sec and then continued to rub again only lighter this Time. Brian seemed to like to as he closed his eyes, and began to wag his tail involuntarily. &quot;Oh yeah that feels so good Mindy please don&#39;t stop. Brian yipped again in a more deeper bark. Mindy continued to rub his head and neck, all the while coming up with her plan to deal with this surprise visitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what am I going to do with you boy?&quot;</p>
