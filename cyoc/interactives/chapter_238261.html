<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason sat slumped in a small, cramped classroom, surrounded by the other alternative provision kids. The desks were tiny and mismatched, as if scavenged from various elementary schools, and the walls were adorned with faded posters about controlling your temper and making good choices.  <br />
<br />
He glanced at the whiteboard, where the teacher—a harried man in his early thirties—was scribbling, *“How to Handle Big Emotions”*. Jason sighed heavily. The lesson was basic, like something meant for first graders, but it was geared toward the 9-to-14-year-old students in the program.  <br />
<br />
The teacher’s voice droned on about counting to ten when you’re angry and taking deep breaths. Jason’s thoughts swirled. He wasn’t angry—he was *terrified*. Every time he looked down at his hands or caught sight of his reflection in the window, he was reminded of the scrawny, wiry body he was trapped in. His body wasn’t his own anymore.  <br />
<br />
Worse, everyone treated him like he’d always been Jason. Teachers called his name like it was the most natural thing in the world. Riley acted like they were lifelong best friends, cracking jokes and dragging Jason into conversations. Even the other kids in the program, the ones who mostly ignored Riley’s antics, accepted Jason as one of them.  <br />
<br />
Jason tapped his pencil against his desk, fidgeting restlessly. His body didn’t seem to want to stay still, like a constant itch under his skin. He found himself squirming in his chair, his legs bouncing uncontrollably. He’d never felt like this before, and it was driving him crazy.  <br />
<br />
“Jason!” the teacher barked, breaking him out of his thoughts.  <br />
<br />
Jason froze, realizing his pencil tapping had gotten louder. “Sorry,” he muttered, his cheeks flushing.  <br />
<br />
Riley, sitting two seats away, snorted. “Nice one, dude,” he whispered with a smirk.  <br />
<br />
Jason rolled his eyes but couldn’t help smiling faintly.  <br />
<br />
### **The Prank**  <br />
<br />
By the time the next break rolled around, Jason was already bored out of his mind. The lessons were simplistic, and the endless lectures about managing emotions felt pointless. He wasn’t supposed to be here—none of this was supposed to be happening. But his new body had other ideas. His restlessness built with every passing minute, and sitting still felt like torture.  <br />
<br />
Riley, of course, had no trouble filling the time.  <br />
<br />
“Come on, Jason,” Riley said, grinning mischievously as they loitered near the back entrance to the school. The cold air nipped at their faces, and Jason hugged his arms around himself.  <br />
<br />
“What now?” Jason asked, already wary.  <br />
<br />
Riley’s grin widened. “We’re gonna make it slippery.”  <br />
<br />
“Slippery?”  <br />
<br />
Riley snickered and pointed to the entrance. “Watch and learn.”  <br />
<br />
Before Jason could stop him, Riley unzipped his pants and started peeing on the concrete just outside the door. The cold air turned his breath into mist, and the puddle began to spread.  <br />
<br />
Jason’s jaw dropped. “Are you serious?!”  <br />
<br />
“Come on, it’ll freeze!” Riley said, zipping up. “It’s freezing out here. They’ll slip right on their asses.”  <br />
<br />
Jason hesitated, his cheeks burning. The idea was ridiculous, stupid—and yet, he couldn’t help but imagine the chaos it would cause.  <br />
<br />
“You scared?” Riley teased, grinning.  <br />
<br />
Jason bristled. “No!”  <br />
<br />
Before he could second-guess himself, Jason unzipped his own pants, awkwardly fumbling with the unfamiliar motion. His new anatomy felt strange and alien, but as he relieved himself, a surprising sense of freedom washed over him. He didn’t have to sit down, didn’t have to worry about dirty bathrooms—just aim and go.  <br />
<br />
He finished quickly, stepping back and feeling both embarrassed and exhilarated.  <br />
<br />
Riley clapped him on the shoulder. “See? Not so bad, huh?”  <br />
<br />
Jason shrugged, trying to act nonchalant, but a small smile tugged at his lips.  <br />
<br />
The boys hurried back inside, giggling like conspirators. It didn’t take long for the results of their prank to unfold.  <br />
<br />
First, a tall high schooler wearing a varsity jacket came charging out of the door. His sneakers hit the frozen puddle, and he went down hard, his books flying in all directions.  <br />
<br />
Jason and Riley burst into laughter, clutching their sides as the older boy scrambled to his feet, glaring around furiously.  <br />
<br />
It didn’t stop there. A group of girls came out next, one of them slipping and grabbing her friend for balance, sending both of them tumbling to the ground. The chaos was too much. Jason laughed harder than he ever had, tears streaming down his face as he leaned against Riley for support.  <br />
<br />
For the first time, Jason felt… oddly at ease. He wasn’t the quiet, overlooked Jessica anymore. In this body, as Jason, he could get into trouble, laugh at stupid pranks, and just let go.  <br />
<br />
### **Life at Home**  <br />
<br />
When Jason got home that evening, everything felt different. His parents were more involved than they’d ever been before.  <br />
<br />
“How was school, champ?” his dad asked as Jason walked through the door.  <br />
<br />
“Uh… fine,” Jason muttered.  <br />
<br />
“Good. Let’s get you ready for soccer practice,” his dad said, clapping him on the shoulder.  <br />
<br />
“Soccer practice?” Jason echoed, confused.  <br />
<br />
His mom chimed in. “Your schedule’s on the fridge. Practice tonight, piano tomorrow, then your tutoring session. We’re keeping you busy, mister.”  <br />
<br />
Jason blinked, overwhelmed. His old life as Jessica had been quiet and uneventful. But now, every moment seemed planned out, as if his parents were trying to keep him constantly occupied.  <br />
<br />
His new room was a shock. The walls were plastered with posters—video games, skateboards, and a few of scantily clad women that made Jason’s face burn. Fidget toys were scattered across the desk, and a sleek gaming system sat on the floor, surrounded by stacks of games.  <br />
<br />
That night, after dinner and a whirlwind of activities, Jason found himself tucked into bed by his dad.  <br />
<br />
“Sleep tight, bud,” his dad said, ruffling Jason’s hair before turning off the light.  <br />
<br />
Jason lay there in his new bed, staring at the ceiling. The sheets smelled like boyish deodorant, the faint scent of sweat lingering in the air. His body felt foreign, every shift reminding him of how small and wiry he’d become.  <br />
<br />
He couldn’t stop thinking about the prank with Riley. It had been disgusting, childish, and completely out of character for who he used to be—and yet, it had been fun.  <br />
<br />
*What’s happening to me?*  <br />
<br />
Jason sighed, curling up under the covers. He needed to get back to his grandfather, to figure out how to undo this. But every attempt to call him had been blocked by his mom.  <br />
<br />
“Don’t bother your grandfather with your rambling, Jason,” she had said dismissively.  <br />
<br />
Jason clenched his fists under the blankets. He didn’t belong here, but he had no idea how to fix it.  <br />
<br />
The last thought that crossed his mind before sleep claimed him was a mix of fear and reluctant amusement: the memory of the older kids slipping on the frozen puddle, Riley’s laughter echoing in his ears.  <br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jason lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. The quiet hum of the house was interrupted only by the occasional creak of floorboards or the distant murmur of the TV in the living room. Sleep refused to come, no matter how tightly he shut his eyes or how much he shifted beneath the covers. His mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, refusing to let him rest.  <br />
<br />
Soccer practice had been… an experience. As Jessica, she’d dabbled in soccer at a casual level during gym class or the occasional pick-up game with classmates. But Jason’s body was built for it. His new muscles—wiry and strong—responded with an agility and speed that left him almost exhilarated.  <br />
<br />
At practice, the coach had barked instructions, and Jason found himself running faster than he ever thought possible. His legs didn’t tire as easily, his kicks packed more power, and he could weave through other players like it was second nature.  <br />
<br />
Yet, it wasn’t perfect.  <br />
<br />
Every time Jason stopped to wait for his turn or to listen to instructions, he felt the itch return—the maddening restlessness that made him tap his foot or drum his fingers against his thigh. His teammates noticed, and while they didn’t seem to mind his inability to sit still, a few of them groaned in frustration when he zoned out or missed cues during drills.  <br />
<br />
“You’re good, Jason,” one boy had said after practice, tossing Jason a water bottle. “But seriously, chill out sometimes.”  <br />
<br />
Jason had just nodded, forcing a grin. The boys weren’t close friends—not yet, anyway—but they seemed to accept him. For now, that was enough.  <br />
<br />
Now, lying in bed, Jason replayed the events of the day over and over in his mind. The lessons at school, the prank with Riley, the shock of soccer practice—all of it felt surreal.  <br />
<br />
What would tomorrow bring? He didn’t even know what to expect. Every moment in this body was a new challenge, a reminder of just how alien his life had become.  <br />
<br />
Then there was another problem—a very specific problem.  <br />
<br />
Jason shifted uncomfortably under the blankets, his cheeks flushing in the darkness. His new anatomy had been strange enough to deal with during the day, but now, lying still and alone, he couldn’t ignore it. The unfamiliar sensation in his boxers was distracting, and no matter how much he tried to ignore it, his body refused to cooperate.  <br />
<br />
His hand hesitantly brushed over his stomach, the sensation foreign and startling. His heart raced as he swallowed nervously. *How the hell do boys deal with this?*  <br />
<br />
Jason bit his lip, his mind racing with embarrassment and curiosity. He knew he’d have to figure it out eventually—how to manage this strange, new part of himself.  <br />
<br />
But not tonight. Not yet.  <br />
<br />
He pulled the blankets tighter around himself, willing his body to calm down, willing his mind to shut off. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, and he wasn’t ready for them—not even close.</p>
