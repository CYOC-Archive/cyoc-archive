<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Willow had come into the training room at the early hours this morning, the feeling of loneliness without her baby was proving to have its toll on her emotions, but as the Lady of the western wood, she could not afford such weakness, but still, she wanted a baby, she wanted HER baby, she needed him like she needed air, but after looking into Mazy and Rose&#39;s eyes, she knew taking her divided sons abaw from them would brake them, they had bonded with them now, on a maternal level, Willow knew this bond...and now knew the pain of having it broken.<br />
<br />
But she had an idea, she had seen how the circles over the girl&#39;s abdomens worked, he had memorised the chant, and if her idea worked, she would be able to be a mother once again, so Willow set to work, she pulled out a brush and a pot of ink and opened the front of her dress over her stomach, and began to draw, once she had finished her modified circle she began to chant, in theory this circle would draw in the nearest unborn child of the closest woman and transfer it to her, but still that was just a theory.<br />
<br />
Once Willow finished the chant, the circle began to glow, and a bright light emerged from the shadows of the room, but no one was there, so where had the gems of theis unborn children come from?, her questions were answered when a cloaked figure seemed to materialise from the shadows and darted through the open window, someone had been in her manner without her knowledge, hiding in plane sight.<br />
<br />
But Willow became distracted when the four gems began to pass into her waiting womb, Willow groaned as she felt the gems take root within her, but instead of pain, Willow found that she felt warm, loving, and...maternal, then she felt the concealment gems shatter, and the babies began their growth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...what&#39;s going on?...did I do something wrong?&quot; Questioned Willow as her new children only seemed to grow to the size of one month old  babies, her son had grown to the size of a newborn, but thies children only left Willow with a slight bulge in her lower belly, Willow curiously placed her hand over it, and she felt them, her Babies tiny heartbeats, it felt like small drums were playing within her and a single tear fell to the wooden floor, she would once again be a mother, and thanks to the sealing circle on her skin, she could never loose them ever again, but then there was the cloaked figure, who were they, and why did Willow&#39;s spell work on them...<br />
<br />
Willow focused on theis memories as she observed her new students try to summon fire, Mazy and Rose were sweating like a blacksmith in the forge, their bellies shining with the sparks they produced from their palms, Willow was impressed that they could even muster THAT, it took some apprentices weeks to muster even a plume of smoke, yet theis two pregnant women had created sparks on day one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady- I mean Master?&quot; Came Rose&#39;s panting voice, her head down and her hands on her knees as she gasped for breath, beads of sweat dripping to the floor &quot;yes Rose what is it&quot; &quot;may we take a brake, I know that I&#39;m just about spent on theis sparks at the moment...and this little guys antics aren&#39;t making it any easier&quot; giggled Rose, Mazy simply nodded in agreement, still trying to light her fire, Willow gave a chuckle and waved her hand, and Three large round cushions floated over and arranged themselves around a now raised stone circle &quot;very well girl&#39;s, I suppose you&#39;ve earned it&quot; giggled Willow as the two young witches waddled over to lay on the pillows.<br />
<br />
But as Willow rose from her cross leged position, she found she had to arch her back slightly to stay balanced, glancing down in shock she found that her once loose fitting red gown was now beginning to be pulled tight around her slightly bigger belly, instinctively she putt both hands over her bellies swell in an attempt to hide it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?...is everything alright?&quot; Asked Mazy as she looked at her concerned, Willow composed herself and waved it of &quot;I am fine Mazy, just feeling a bit stressed with the queen&#39;s talk of the oncoming war last week, really I&#39;m fine&quot; lied Willow, Mazy and Rose immediately saw that their master was lying to them, but if she was to lie, that must mean she had a good reason, so they didn&#39;t push her about it, Willow was eager to change the subject and turned her focus to the girl&#39;s pregnancies.<br />
<br />
&quot;So girl&#39;s...how have you been handling the sudden changes?&quot; Asked Willow, Mazy gave a sigh and leaned back, letting her belly have a bit more breathing room &quot;well so far we seem to be getting along well, although this craving for milk or cheese is starting to get to me since this morning&quot; giggled Mazy as she traced small circles along her belly with her fingers, Rose however was clutching the sides of her belly as everyone could visibly see the baby within kick and punch within her womb &quot;I wish I could say the same my love, this little one has been like a bull out of the gate all morning, rolling around, kicking punching, I swear if he ever found a way out of their, he&#39;d go and arm wrestle a minotaur&quot; groaned Rose as she lay back and slowly began massaging her maternal swell, quietly singing an Elven lullaby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rivers cold, and canopies high,<br />
Please my darling do not cry,<br />
For dragons call from yonder High,<br />
Call to you to gaze to the sky,<br />
Their song so sweet, enchanting and proud,<br />
They sing to those who dwell on the ground&quot;<br />
<br />
Willow had never heard or seen such love and passion in an elven song, most of their songs were if great battles and stolen treasures from the human relm, but this one seemed to speak of the days of the dragons song, a time long forgotten, before the border, before the wars, when the dragons were many in number and sang of their freedom and compassion for life for those who dwelled out among the forrest at night, Willow then began to gently stroke the underside of her gradually growing womb, feeling the heartbeats and tiny movements within, and prayed to the gods that times could go back to how they were then, looking up she saw that Rose and Mazy had fallen asleep, curled around their wombs, hugging their unborn children as they slept.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my darlings, I think we should get some much needed sleep as well&quot; said Willow as she petted her belly and began to hum the same tune that Rose had sung as she drifted off to sleep, unaware that Rose was peaking at her the whole time, but Rose just gave a smile Nd drifted off to sleep, unaware of the black mass that disappeared into the shadows....</p>
