<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ready to head to that party now, bro?”<br />
“Sure,” Theo said. <br />
“I don’t think so, man. We need to get you dressed. Let’s stop at my place and we can find something for you to wear there.” <br />
Theo would have been content to walk down the streets holding Tommy’s hand for the rest of the day. He didn’t care about the party at all. Nothing felt as comfortable as having Tommy at his side. They walked a block or two before they got to Tommy’s car. At Tommy’s house, Theo sat in the car until Tommy told him to get out. <br />
“C’mon, bro – you’re not going to get dressed in the car.”<br />
Theo followed Tommy into the house. It appeared no one was home and they went up to Tommy’s room. Tommy moved to the closet, rifling through his hangers. Theo looked about the room at Tommy’s pictures and some trophies he had on a shelf above the bed. The bed was made, and he wondered if Tommy made it himself or Tommy’s mother did it for him. <br />
“Try these on. I think you’ll look pretty hot in them.” Tommy held up a pair of designer jeans. <br />
Theo thought hot was a weird word to use for Tommy, but he walked over and grabbed them. He noted the leather patch on the back with the Hugo Boss named stamped on it. Theo would never understand why someone would spend $250 on a pair of jeans when they could get a different pair for $50. <br />
“Put them on, dude. I think they will fit. They were mine when I was a little chunkier.” Tommy laughed once more. “I don’t mean that your heavy at all, man.”<br />
Theo looked about the room, trying to figure out where he was going to change. <br />
“It’s okay, bro, we’re buds. No need to change in the bathroom. I promise, I won’t look.”<br />
Theo nodded and unbuckled his belt, still feeling self-conscious as he slid his pants down. He felt like his red underwear was a beacon as he quickly moved to slip on the other pants. Theo cursed himself for the choice he had made earlier in selecting them. He slid his foot into the leg of the jeans and attempted to slide his leg inside. His foot caught on the edge of the jeans and he pitched forward, nearly falling on the floor before catching himself on side of the bed. Theo felt blood rush up into his face as he blushed, and he stood up, mumbling something as he looked away from Tommy. <br />
“Dude, you almost bit it big time,” Tommy said. “Your face is almost as red as your underwear.” Then seeing Theo’s face, he realized how embarrassed he was. “I’m sorry, man – you okay?” <br />
Theo shook his head, his face still crimson from almost falling. He held the pants against him not quite ready to try again. “I’m okay. Clumsy is all.” <br />
He slowly pressed his foot into the pant leg once more as Tommy watched. He successfully pulled the pants up and looked back at Tommy, smiling as if he accomplished some great feat. Tommy was staring down at his red underwear as it bunched at the top of his pants. Theo quickly pushed it down inside and pulled up the zipper. The pants actually fit quite well. <br />
“That’s some package you packed in there, bro,” Tommy said. Theo wasn’t sure if he was talking about his underwear, his real package or him personally, tucked into the new pants. “I didn’t think it would all fit in there,” he giggled again. <br />
Theo found himself giggling back, his mind digesting Tommy’s comment. He wondered if it meant what he thought it meant. He felt a stirring in that same package as his mind worked through the comment. Incredibly, as he looked down, he could see himself growing inside of the jeans. <br />
“That, my friend,” Tommy said, “is why those jeans are worth the big bucks.”<br />
Theo looked up at Tommy who was still staring down at his crotch. He felt himself grow even more, pressing against the inside of the red underwear even as he willed himself to stop. Tommy took a step toward him and Theo froze. His imagination whirred as he fast-paced the potential outcomes of the current situation. He briefly wondered if math class would help him determine the possible combinations of the outcome at this particular moment. Tommy was less than a foot away from him. <br />
“We should be getting to the frat party,” he said, his voice sounding if it lacked confidence. <br />
“Yes,” Theo said, looking up into Tommy’s face. Those eyes, staring into his.<br />
“My brother will be waiting for me.”<br />
“I know,” Theo said. “Is this shirt okay?” Theo tried, hoping to change the subject, or at least break up the moment. <br />
“No – Pokemon has to go,” Tommy said. “I’ll find you something in a minute. Right now, it’s these pants that have me concerned.” Tommy’s hand reached down to the front of Theo’s pants. “They have a big lump in them, right here.”<br />
The fingers of Tommy’s hand slid over the bulge in Theo’s pants. Theo gulped audibly and poked down as the fingers gently traced the shape of his cock. Then he looked back up at Tommy and watched as Tommy bent his head down to him His lips pressed against him as Tommy’s mouth covered his. The hand on his pants slid further down between his legs, cupping his balls before sliding back up. At the same time, tommy’s tongue pressed into his mouth and Theo knew what heaven must taste like as he licked and sucked on Tommy’s tongue. He gently grinded against the hand, his own hands sliding around Tommy, pulling him close, his hands closing over his ass. <br />
When they pulled away from their kiss, Theo looked up at Tommy and watched a grin appear on this face. <br />
“Still want to go to the frat party?” Theo managed.</p>
