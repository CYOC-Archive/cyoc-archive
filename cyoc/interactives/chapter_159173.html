<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He decides he should get up to check when that administrator will return, it seems like it’s been ages. Standing up, some threads of his now somewhat looser suit get caught on the chair. It seems he must’ve have picked of his worse quality suits in his rush as it rips right through his pants and suit as he falls over, knocking into the water bottle as he does, causing it to spill all over him.<br />
<br />
“Damn it...” he mutters under his breath in frustration as an annoyed librarian walks over to help him up. <br />
<br />
“Well it seems you’re in quite a dilemma now” she comments as she looks over his loose torn suit which is now hanging on.<br />
<br />
“I am really sorry ma’am” he gives his reflective apology to any authority figure he gets on the bad side of at work, and something about this librarian did seem to give off an air of authority. He may still be taller than her but she seems oddly somewhat bigger now that she’s standing up.<br />
<br />
“At least that water only got on you and nothing with paper” she says causing him to look in amazement to see that she’s right, somehow the water has managed to not damage anything besides his suit. He supposed he should be thankful, the last thing he needs is the school chasing him up for damage payments.<br />
<br />
“There are some spare clothes in the back, they should fit you. Go get changed” she then throws him a bag “put your old clothes in here, I’ll have the cleaners see if it’s fixable”<br />
<br />
Aaron gladly takes the bag and heads to the room he was directed to. At least it seems he’s not in trouble, and they’re even going to try to fix this. He supposed he can’t complain about this, he should’ve made sure his suit was okay.<br />
<br />
Heading into the back room he takes off whats left of his suit and tosses it in the bag. He notes even his boxers were wet and torn. Embarrassed somewhat he also tosses them in, hoping whoever’s job it is to fix this doesn’t mind. Even his shoes and socks go in from having too much water on them. Now naked, he passes the bag behind the door to the librarian before going to find the spare clothes they have.<br />
<br />
He notes that he seems to have lost weight, guess he’s been to busy to notice. Picking up the clothes he finds a light  singlet and some denim shorts with a belt. He almost blushes at the clothes, and he does blush when he sees what looks like panties. <br />
<br />
“Uh,, are you sure these are the only clothes you have” he asks to the door, but after a while of no awnser he reasons the librarian must have already left.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he decides he can just change later. It’s not like his wife is going to be coming home soon anyway so he has plenty of time to get some proper clothes. He can’t exactly leave this room without anything on and so without other options he puts them on.<br />
<br />
First with the parties, which fit barely over his manhood. He then struggles to pull the demin shorts on, he didn’t even think it would be possible but slowly but surely they move up, his leg far seemingly rearranging itself to accomodate. It feels like as if the fat moved up his body. He ties the belt around to ensure it stays in place.<br />
<br />
Taking a few breaths as his stomach felt like it was twisting, he then pulled the singlet over his head, nearly stretching it to get it on. As he does he feels something underneath it. Is that a bra? It seems that the singlet had a bra in it which he didn’t notice. He considered taking it off to get it out, but it already took so much effort just getting it on and he was a afraid of stretching it too much not moving it around again. So instead he fiddles with the singlet to get it to fit more comfortably.<br />
<br />
After a while it feels as if his stomach was residing to making way for it. Odd. Although it still seems to not fit over his entire body, leaving a good deal of his midriff exposed.<br />
<br />
Brushing bad a strain of hair from his eyes, wait what..? He decides it must have just been something blown in his eyes his he’s balding and certainly not hairy enough to have it drop to his eyes. Besides, this hair seemed red-ish. <br />
<br />
Of the final note is shoes, he doesn’t want to walk around bare footed so he searches the room for any shoes he could borrow. Eventually he finds some slightly heeled  sandals tucked away, which he picks after a while of not finding anything else.<br />
<br />
Pulling them onto his legs he pulls them on just barely having them fit, but in the end he gets them both on and stands up. After which he immediately stumbles from the tightness and unfamiliar sandals. Causing him to knock into a shelf and a small simple heart necklace to drop around his neck, not that he noticed though as he was too focused on getting his bearings.<br />
<br />
He tried waking again, this time getting better and slowly walked out of the room. Returning to the library he notes that the librarian is gone and so is the forum he filled in for fun. He hopes that doesn’t cause any problems. <br />
<br />
Looking around he pauses briefly to scratch his chest as some of his slowly moves to where breasts might be found, although right now it easily barely noticeable. While the rest of the fat regressed into more youthful slimness.<br />
<br />
He ponders what to do now.</p>
