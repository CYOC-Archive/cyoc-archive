<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can you transform me into a female dragon, like the one you described earlier hypothetically? I&#39;m honestly really curious, and anxious knowing that you can do that.&quot; You said with your mouth open and your forked tongue hanging out, closing your eyes and imagining it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So your perverted male dragon instincts have finally kicked in. Very well you are under my power, but I&#39;m not turning you back, this spell only works once.&quot; The witch said and she snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
 Suddenly your body began tingling and you looked down to see both of your black dicks become fully erect then slowly shrink away and your sheath reformed into a scaled vagina. Almost immediately you had urges to play with your new slit and you reached down and began caressing the surface with your claws as your legs lost their masculinity and your hips became wide. Moments later your upper body lost its masculinity, and your body formed an hourglass shape. Your body became slightly skinnier but your muscles still remained, and your body became slightly shorter by a few inches. You then saw two orbs forming on your chest and slowly inflate with milk and you held them as they grew nipples and formed two GG cup breasts and you held them both in your claws, and groped them. Your ass then bulged creating a cushion-like surface and it became more noticeable and plump for all to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, wow, this body feels so...so...so amazing mistress!&quot; You said in a higher pitched feminine tone and peppy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, I was expecting for you to be a little bit more shocked by this, and maybe a tad bit upset.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I be upset? This is what I wanted after all, besides maybe I can meet a male.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Those new hormones of yours seem to be taking effect.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, do you know of any male dragons by the way? Like ones that would possibly be willing to care about me, and treat me well. I know you can just make me pregnant, but mistress I wish to be impregnated by a male instead of a spell.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;My word you are anxious aren&#39;t you my dear?&quot; The witch asked and you nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to thank you for everything you&#39;ve done from the bottom of my heart mistress. I will always be loyal to you, and to whoever claims me too. Wait, why do I feel so excited to serve until a male?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Female dragons are submissive, and you are in that stage of a dragon life where these feelings are common. Luckily for you, I know someone who likes exotic features when looking for a mate, and he hasn&#39;t found one yet. He has served me, and I have done favors for him. I believe that the two of you will go perfectly together.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;You do? Oh thank you so much mistress, I can&#39;t thank you enough for what you&#39;re doing right now.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, but when I ask you for a favor you have to obey whatever I say, understand Nightmare?&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes....wait what if I&#39;m pregnant, or watching eggs?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I shall go to him, or possibly summon another familiar when the time comes. I may also have an offer for him that will benefit your relationship during intimate stages.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh mistress, I just want to hug you right now, but I&#39;m afraid of hurting you.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Dragon intellect is the greatest thing about you creatures, you always think three times before a human can think once. Allow me to contact him, so that I may inform him about everything Nightmare. In the meantime, have fun doing whatever you wish.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
Your stomach gurgled and you rubbed it and smiled awkwardly,&quot;Heh, what exactly do dragons eat?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Cattle, deer, humans, among other things. There&#39;s a caravan that usually runs directly north of here, feel free to raid it, and kill any human there is. Just try not to damage and supplies and bring back any sort of alchemy ingredients, they will be marked of course.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think that I am getting flying instincts, so I&#39;ll just take to the air and be right back.&quot; You said and jumped into the air using your muscular legs and opened your wings and began flying north. Eventually you caught sight of a wagon being pulled by a couple of horses.<br />
<br />
You then swooped down right in front of the caravan and the horses freaked and bounded up onto their hind legs. There were two men at the reigns of the horses and two others who were wearing full body armor like knights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I see that you&#39;re busy here, but I&#39;m starving right now, and before you begin, yes I am a dragon that is humanoid.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU HAVE BREASTS!!!&quot; One of the guards shouted, and that caught you off-guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I do and why is that a problem? I&#39;m looking to impress a certain male here today, so I&#39;m happy by them. Besides I don&#39;t like being judged, especially by those who are drastically smaller than me, and are about to become my meal. Sooo...&quot; you said and while the men stared at your body, you slashed the harnesses of the horses and left claw marks on both of them. The horses immediately took off running and you smiled as the two men in the wagon began running as well.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the two guards drew their swords and began making their towards you, and you noticed both of them constantly looking at your breasts. &quot;B..beast, we shall strike you down!&quot; One of the guards yelled<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s cute, but as you can see from these marks,&quot; you said gesturing to your scars from before,&quot;I&#39;m no stranger to fighting. I&#39;m not here for the caravan here anyways, so this is going perfectly for me. However I like my heat cooked so the armor can come off.&quot; You said and the guards looked at each other puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, I&#39;m just going to have to do this my way.&quot; You said smiling and rushed at one of the guards. The guard hesitated and you tackled him as soon as he was about to swing his sword, and he dropped it. You then began using your claws to tear off the armor from the man, but as you did you felt something hit the back of your head and you looked up to see the other guard with a broken sword, and the blade fell behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You idiot! Never go for a dragon&#39;s head, it&#39;s thick for a reason!&quot; The pinned guard shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But is it even a dragon?!&quot; The other man asked worried <br />
<br />
&quot;You both know that I&#39;m right here, and speaking of swords...&quot; you said then looked towards the other sword on the ground. You took a deep breath and let out a massive torrent of flames from your maw and the sword was melted. <br />
<br />
&quot;That felt good,&quot; you said then looked up at the guard who hit you with his sword and continued,&quot;If I were you, I would probably be running right now. You know before I get done with this one&#39;s bones.&quot; You said grinning sinisterly.<br />
<br />
The guard almost immediately began running and the other one that you were pinning down looked pissed and yelled,&quot;Coward!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think he&#39;s the least of your worries right now. Oh well, see you if I ever die.&quot; You said smiling and slashed the man&#39;s throat with your claw, and you watched him bleed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that really was easy. I wonder what human tastes like?&quot; You thought to yourself and undressed the man until he was naked. &quot;There we are, now let&#39;s begin.&quot; You said taking a large chomp out of the man&#39;s arm, and swallowed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, did I eat the bone? Am I supposed to eat the bone? Oh well, I&#39;ll know when I know. Love the taste though, but it was raw, maybe too raw for me. Was I really a human like these idiots?&quot; You thought to yourself and then tore off the other arm and baked it for a few minutes with your fire, and took a bite and thought it was better than before. You devoured the rest of the arm and felt satisfied, so you incinerated the corpse and licked your claws clean of any leftover blood. You then saw a crate in the carriage labeled &quot;alchemy ingredients&quot; and thought to yourself,&quot;As my mistress commands, I will obey.&quot;<br />
<br />
You picked up the crate and realized that it was surprisingly light, and you took a peak inside. You were shocked to see that the crate was filled with all sorts of plants, small body parts of animals, and other sorts of bizarre things all in jars and to contain and preserve. There were at least 27 jars just from what you saw and the crate had many more stacked inside of it. &quot;Lets be careful going back.&quot; You thought to yourself and you decided to walk back through the woods, thinking that you didn&#39;t travel too far north.</p>
