<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer made her way off the bus with Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Btw, I went to the circus outside of town last night and got some GREAT ideas for your hair babe.&quot; Molly said as she dug around in her bag for her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously&quot; Jennifer said as she rose a black eyebrow. &quot;I'm getting fashion advice from the loacalohmygash that is so cute!&quot; she giggled as Molly showed her the hairstyle, a pink style that was parted in the middle and let long bangs frame her face yet either side were these knotted buns in yellow, bubblegum pink and hot pink. It made the two buns look like strips of interlaced candy.<br />
<br />
It was at this moment she blinked, her long lashes fluttering as she realised how much she actually liked the look of that style, and surprised at the squeal of approval and excitement she displayed when Molly showed it to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could totally rock it girl!&quot; Molly said with a big smile. Jen wondered why Molly was still being friendly. Granted she didn't mind and she didn't want to knock it, however it was a little strange. Most of the people on the bus had called her names, although it was more playful than malicious although some indeed were, those ones came from the more narrow-minded and judgemental people.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she heard a voice of the biggest jock at the school. Jason Fielding, &quot;Time for the daily wedgying.&quot; Jen felt fear rush through her, she had never ever been given a wedgie, usually only the geeks got that. She wanted to run, but her legs stood still, as if on autopilot and she felt Jason grab her undies and pull. She went to her tiptoes as she felt the underwear dig into her, but it wasn't painful, a little uncomfortable. What was most surprising though was her reaction and the reaction of those around her.<br />
<br />
<br />
Her hand flew to her mouth and it became apparent to her she was doing a parody of a shocked expression as she said in a deadpan voice, tinged with happiness and glee. &quot;Oh no! Whatever shall I do, please do not wedgie my pretty polka-dotted panties!&quot; she giggled and suddenly the hallways erupted into laughter and she shivered as she felt a wetness once again enter her private regions, at the same time she felt her panties being let go and a few minutes later, normality was returned to the hallway.<br />
<br />
Even Molly was chuckling, but that just made Jen...happy. It felt good to make people laugh, and more than just in the downstairs department store of clown pantaloons ltd. She giggled internally at her joke.<br />
<br />
On the way to class she was tripped at least two times, both times revealing her panties to the world thanks to the suspenders, conveniently becoming undone. Both times resulted in everyone laughing at Jen and herself getting some more wetness down below. From what she could gather, she was the 'class clown' and as such she was the foil for most (not all) but most jokes in the school to keep the other students entertained and happy and as such, hardworking. <br />
<br />
Molly told her how it was brought in by the school as an experiment and it was going so well the idea was rumoured to be underdone at other schools. Although Jen knew the class clowns there were probably not as genuine as her.<br />
<br />
She reached her locker and found that unlike the others which were all a dull greyish-blue. Hers was a plethora of color with flower designs, swirls and other cutesy and silly decals over it. In ornate pink letters across it it red 'Jenny T. Clown'. &quot;T?&quot; she asks Molly, her middle name was...she couldn't think of it and then it popped in there and in an almost resigned voice she said &quot;The...&quot; at the same time that Molly offered it to her. <br />
<br />
Picking up a post it note on the locker she saw it was from Andrea, the captain of the cheerleading squad. &quot;Hey Jen, don't forget we have practice at 11:00 today. Just let your teacher know and we'll see you on the field!&quot; Jen felt a bit of relief was over her. Thank god she was still a cheerleader. Come to think of it, despite her new position in the school as the entertainment, her social status remained, mostly, intact.<br />
<br />
The inside of her locker looked more at home in a circus than a school, while she did own a few books including &quot;The Magic of Laughter&quot; and &quot;1001 Clown Skits&quot; she also had some actually useful text books and utilities like pens, pencils, ruler, eraser, notepad, squirty lapel flower, joy buz...it was at this point she stopped listing off what her mind associated as 'useful utilities' and closed her locker after retrieving some, including the flower.<br />
<br />
She was one of the last to enter her morning class. &quot;Good morning Miss Winterton&quot; she said in an exaggerated manner and skipped over to her desk. The voice in her head questioning what on earth she was doing acting in such an over the top way. She pulled the chair out from under her desk...the blue chair with yellow stripes, her mind acknowledged that there was something on the chair, but that is as far as it went. She eyed the beige of the other students chairs...hers did actually look more fun and appealing. She cut that thought off as she sat at the red and black polka-dotted desk.<br />
<br />
PHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP.<br />
<br />
A silence crossed the room as Jen shuffled her feet, she had seen it, she knew what it was when she saw it. Yet she still sat down without any attempt to remove whoopee cushion. After a few seconds, with masterful comic timing she didn't realise she was performing with said. &quot;It wasn't me...&quot;<br />
<br />
The class just cracked up and erupted into laughter and applause, she blushed as she felt a familiar tingle down below and within minutes class was settled and starting.</p>
