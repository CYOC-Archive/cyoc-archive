<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sounds of battle quieted along the eastern part of the Superior Church HQ. To the outside observer, they would think the church and S.P.E.A.R departed the area. This was far from the truth.<br />
<br />
S.P.E.A.R agents and the Superior Church paused in their attacks, watching as a black and blue blur battled through the area. Sparks flew from the colliding blades, equipment smashed by the combatants. For both parties they could do little more than shudder and stare in awe at the battle prowess of two kitsune warriors.<br />
<br />
Akira skid backwards, preparing himself for another attack. This fight ranged all over the headquarters, the pair of kitsune bouncing among platforms and pillars. Akira, trying to disarm his master. Fukushu, blinded by rage trying to destroy his long time apprentice and friend.<br />
<br />
Once more the pairs blades clashed, Akira expertly deflecting Fukushu&#39;s every blow. The nine tail kitsune&#39;s strength was incredible, flashes of light exploding from the blades colliding. Still, Fukushu could not break through his defense. If anything, Akira was breaking through Fukushu&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Two problems became very apparent as Akira battled his old master. The first was the fact that despite being a better swordsman, Fukushu&#39;s unrelenting stamina meant that no matter what Akira did the kitsune general would not stop. Fukushu had several cuts along his furry body, his hikama becoming more tattered as the battle dragged on. As impossible as it seemed, none of Akira&#39;s attacks seemed to be causing harm.<br />
<br />
The second problem was Fukushu&#39;s strength. As the battle continued, Fukushu became stronger. Deflecting blows from the kitsune was becoming more painful, Akira feeling the blow reverberate through his arms. He felt his limbs grow numb, forcing the kitsune to tighten his grip. Even worse was when Fukushu struck him. Those attacks were dealing far more damage to Akira than the kitsune was prepared for. Several deep gashes along his torso bled heavily, turning his blue hikama a dark crimson.<br />
<br />
Fukushu roared, the pair exchanging attacks and countering. Once more Akira frustrated the nine tail kitsune, his defense nearly impenetrable. Grunting in frustration, Fukushu tapped into his magic unleashing a fireball that knocked Akira back.<br />
<br />
Akira grunted, slamming into a nearby wall before standing once more. Unfortunately for the guardian kitsune, Fukushu&#39;s magic eclipsed his own. For centuries Akira focused on his swordsmanship letting his magic wither. It was only over the last 20 years that he began retraining, attempting to strengthen his inherent magic. Still, it was a work in progress.<br />
<br />
Rising to his feet, Akira could take solace in the fact he had inflicted significant damage to the famed general. As Fukushu took a step, he winced in pain, grasping a deep slash along his thigh. Akira may have slowed down Fukushu, but at what cost.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can not win my old master,&quot; Akira stated, gritting his teeth in pain. &quot;I can do this all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu straightened himself, his eyes filled with rage as he glared Akira.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may be the greatest swordsman our people have ever seen,&quot; he growled. &quot;But you are not our greatest warrior. That title still belongs to me. Already I see you reaching your limits, limits I do not share. Your strength will falter, your stamina will eventually vanish. And it will be all for nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira grit his teeth, he needed to hold out just a bit longer. S.P.E.A.R would eventually capture the heads of the Superior Church. Once they were in custody and away, perhaps then they could speak reason to Fukushu. As he looked to attack once more, he could hear voices calling him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly the kitsune turned, his eyes going wide in shock. &quot;Lilith?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira what are you doing here?&quot; Lilith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking for you,&quot; he replied. Alyssa now curiously looked between Akira and her mother, unsure if who this was and how her mother knew him. &quot;Mom who is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was the head of security when I went to high school,&quot; Lilith replied. &quot;My friends used to talk about him, I thought it was just rumors. They said...he was the Guardian of the Next Generation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They weren&#39;t rumors Lilith,&quot; Akira replied. &quot;I have watched over you and your daughter since we first met. You are just as important to me as Mia, Zack, and the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A touching speech,&quot; Fukushu snarled. &quot;But all you have done is lead me to my quarry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith and Alyssa&#39;s eyes grew wide as Fukushu snarled. The nine tailed kitsune&#39;s fangs barred as he gripped his katana tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any associated with the Superior Church shall fall before my blade!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not with the Church you psycho,&quot; Alyssa yelled. &quot;We&#39;re their prisoners!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your aunt is,&quot; Fukushu countered. &quot;Did you think I did not know about Sophie Kane, daughter of Ezekiel Kane, and your mother&#39;s older sister? The Kane family has taken many kitsune lives over the centuries. When I discovered her existence and that the Church took you, I realized it was only a matter of time before you joined them. I am here to stop you before that happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira growled leaping forward as he once again began to duel Fukushu. The pair of swordsman locking blades, straining to get the upper hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to yourself,&quot; Akira yelled. &quot;You sound mad! Think of your children, your family! Do you truly believe this is what they would want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do this for my family,&quot; Fukushu growled.<br />
<br />
The pair of kitsune masters strained against one another, all their strength channeled into their blade. Neither noticed as a dark figure now moved within the shadows.<br />
<br />
A spray of automatic fire now echoed from the darkness, striking both kitsune. Akira lurched forward, hot lead tearing into his shoulder and back. The six tailed kitsune coughed blood, sagging onto Fukushu&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Fukushu gasped in shock, a bullet cutting him across the cheek and hitting one of his tails. The damage was minimal, Akira&#39;s though was not, which momentarily knocked Fukushu back to his senses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira,&quot; he gasped.<br />
<br />
Slowly he lowered his apprentice to the ground, Fukushu&#39;s furry hands stained with blood. The fight was forgotten for the moment as Fukushu tried to stem the bleeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay with me Akira,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You are not meant to die like this. Ayami, your children, they still need you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blood trickled from Akira&#39;s mouth, the six tailed kitsune locking eyes with Fukushu. The wounds were serious, he needed medical help immediately. Fukushu spiraled, his rage increasing once more. This fight was not meant to kill Akira, only incapacitate him. Now, because of his actions, Akira might die. Glancing up, his eyes filled with fury, he noticed a figure step from the shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seraphim,&quot; Fukushu growled.<br />
<br />
Sophie Kane the Seraphim glared at Fukushu. The woman&#39;s icy blue eyes seemingly staring off into space, while focused on the kitsune. Quickly reloading her assault rifle, she took aim at Fukushu before holding down the trigger.<br />
<br />
Fukushu roared, quickly grabbing his katana before deflecting every shot. As he cleaved the last bullet in half, he could see Sophie attempt to reload. The kitsune rocketed forward, cutting the weapon in half before kicking Sophie into a wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Seraphim,&quot; he growled. &quot;The greatest soldier of the so called Superior Church!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie was dazed, shaking her head as she tried to focus. Quickly she withdrew a pistol, firing at Fukushu. The kitsune dodged and blocked before closing the distance and cutting the barrel of her pistol off.<br />
<br />
Undeterred, Sophie now withdrew a knife. As skilled as the Seraphim was, keeping up with the legendary kitsune was a herculean effort. Fukushu slashed the Seraphim across the chest, across her arms, across the stomach before finally kicking the woman in the chest as hard as he could. Sophie sailed towards the cage Lilith and Alyssa resided in, denting the bars of their cell. Barely conscious, Sophie lay before Fukushu as the kitsune approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; he growled as he raised his katana above his head. &quot;I end the Kane line and the threat they pose to my family!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith gripped her daughter as Alyssa tried to hug Sophie. Just looking into Fukushu&#39;s eyes told them he was beyond reason. The kitsune believed their family was responsible for targeting his family, for grievously hurting Akira. He wouldn&#39;t rest until he mounted their heads on pikes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close your eyes baby,&quot; Lilith whispered, as mother and daughter shut their eyes.<br />
<br />
To the surprise of everyone a figure now sprinted in front of Fukushu, standing between the Kane family and the kitsune. Fukushu&#39;s eyes went wide as a teenager with a magical sword blocked his blow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason,&quot; Fukushu whispered.<br />
<br />
Mason grit his teeth. The blow from his uncle was powerful enough to drive the boy to his knees. Amazingly the boy survived, however the blow separated the fusion of Mason and Fenrir. Now the blonde haired teen and Fenrir stood between Fukushu&#39;s vengeance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle stop,&quot; Mason screamed. &quot;You don&#39;t need to do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu said nothing, his jaw ajar as he stared at his nephew; the boy he felt obligated to once more embrace his vengeful nature. Now, he locked eyes with the boy and noticed a small trickle of blood on the boys forehead. In his rage, Fukushu had cut Mason.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what have I done,&quot; Fukushu gasped, his voice thin as he slowly backed away. The mighty nine tail dropped his katana, sinking to his knees as he stared at his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle,&quot; Mason said softly. &quot;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s over, I&#39;m safe. See, you don&#39;t need to do this. Please...I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised his head, his eyes damp with tears as he gazed at his nephew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason I&#39;m....I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Please...I&#39;m sorry..I...I..only wanted to keep you safe....Please....forgive me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason knelt down, throwing his arms around his uncle. Squeezing the kitsune tightly, he could hear a soft cry escape the mighty nine tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my hero Uncle,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I could never be angry with you.&quot;</p>
