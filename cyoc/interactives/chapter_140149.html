<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I looked down at myself and groaned as large scales started overtaking my body and I noticed metallic gold scales covering my stomach while amber ones overtook everything else. The changes were taking to me fast as my hands and feet rapidly changed shape and structure, both hands and feet on my body only had three large digits now and looked relatively similar to claws. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile my head was rapidly shifting into god knew what into something I couldn’t even see with my own eyes. All I knew was that my voice grew dramatically deeper, my teeth felt sharp, a large snout was obstructing my view, and I had a faint taste of blood on my tongue. Everything around me was blurry, but I could see Tabitha in front of me changing too.<br />
<br />
However Tabitha seemed farther along than I was, and her breasts were gone completely. I figured I had to be hallucinating at first, but then suddenly I heard Tabitha growl in a deep masculine voice like I did and a large 1 foot long cock sprung out from her pussy, and a set of balls below that.<br />
<br />
I was stunned by this until my muscles tensed up and I could only focus on the excruciating pain coursing through my muscles as they cramped up all at once. I then noticed my muscles all bulge and expand all at once, and I felt my body start to power through the pain. I growled and started to push my way up off of the ground, and I noticed my hair falling out in clumps, and two sharp pains in the back of my skull that made me cry out in pain.<br />
<br />
It was then I felt and heard a large CRACK and something extended out of my rear. As I looked back now I saw that I now had a tail about as long as half my height, but then the same thing happened to my shoulder blades and I watched two gigantic leathery wings form before my eyes on my back with lustrous golden flaps.<br />
<br />
I then looked down and watched my own cock swell in size as it suddenly grew out to reach an erect length of 10 inches long, and my balls were now the size of oranges. I coughed violently and saw smoke come from my mouth and nostrils and watched in awe at this unsure of what to make of it at first, but soon I felt as if I had a literal fire in my lungs that I could control and exhale at will.<br />
<br />
The pain soon stopped after this, but my body was numb, my vision was blurred, and I felt woozy. I groaned and got to my feet then stumbled my way into Tabitha&#39;s bathroom that was wide open, and I caught myself on the sink then looked up at myself in the mirror and was shocked.<br />
<br />
My reflection was that of an extremely buff dragon with yellow slitted eyes, with illustrious gold claws, talons, wings, horns and spikes that trailed down my spine to the tip of my tail. I rubbed my eyes and watched my vision refocus itself and I rubbed my eyes and stared back in disbelief, looking at my hands that were large claws with the only human thing about them being the thumb digits on them.<br />
<br />
I took a step backwards, but lost my balance and fell back not used to my new feet, and I was caught in the arms of a larger masculine beast with indigo scales all over his body with thick cyan scales on his underbelly, horns, claws, and spikes. &quot;Calm down, give yourself a moment to compose yourself.&quot; He told me and I nodded to him and fell limp in his arms.<br />
<br />
The dragon smiled and carried me over to a convertible couch that was already pulled out into a bed and he sat me down on it then sat next to me. &quot;So how do you feel?&quot; He asked me with a toothy grin on his face.<br />
<br />
I looked into his eyes and shook my head, allowing my senses to return to their complete focus and I stared at him shocked. &quot;I.... you’re....&quot; I said unsure of what I should’ve expected from my own wish.<br />
<br />
The dragon chuckled at this and said,&quot;Relax, it’s still me, Tabitha. You could’ve told me you were like me beforehand you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked twice and replied,&quot;Y-Yeah, I guess? I... uh....&quot; I definitely wasn’t sure what to say now about this situation, but I couldn’t help but become overwhelmed by a mysterious arousal, and not for the same reasons I thought I’d be turned on by.<br />
<br />
Tabitha paused at your confusion and laughed,&quot;Hold on, what? Are you telling me you didn’t know this was going to happen? Honestly it’s night, bright clear skies too, unless.....&quot; Tabitha paused then looked to me with a wide grin,&quot;...is it your first night?&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn’t quite know how to respond to this, and I nodded to Tabitha blushing profusely. I then found myself staring at Tabitha&#39;s cock and getting turned on of all things by it as my cock hung outside of its sheath partially erect. I tried to look away, but the musk from Tabitha&#39;s body immediately caused my dick to become erect completely and I blushed even harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? What’s this?&quot; Tabitha asked and I watched his hand come down and take hold of my cock and I watched my member throb to life immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.... I.... uh...&quot; I stammered then Tabitha put his claw on my cheek and turned me to face him and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re even more like me than I thought, aren’t you hot stuff?&quot; He asked pulling my face closer to his.<br />
<br />
Both of our bodies were tones with athletics abs, and muscular chest. I watched Tabitha flex his pecs and looked him in the eyes aroused and said,&quot;I... don’t.... am I.... are...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Tabitha wrapped his muscular arms around my body and he pulled me into a kiss that made my eyes widen even more. I felt it all, his lips against mine, his tongue in my mouth, his smoke filled breath, and it was incredible. I just stared at him until he pulled away and my face turned completely red and I felt like I was in love.<br />
<br />
It was then I realized what was going on, I was Tabitha’s ideal lover, I was gay and I was enjoying myself with him. Still Tabitha saw the puzzled look on my face and his expression grew somber and disheartened. &quot;O-Oh, are you not...... nevermind sorry.&quot; He replied to me.<br />
<br />
It was then by some instinct and passion I pulled our muzzled together again and gave Tabitha the biggest and most passionate kiss I could and he looked back at me and I watched his expression slowly grow into a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....oh my god Joe you’re...&quot; Tabitha muttered and I smiled a bit and said,&quot;It just... felt.... right, okay? I don’t know why... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabitha chuckled and put a claw on my shoulder and said,&quot;I think I know why, we’re both horny men, who both have a common affection for one another. But mostly,&quot; Tabitha leaned closer to me and whispered in my fin-like ear,&quot;We’re both gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn’t quite believe what Tabitha told me at first, but there was no use denying it so I nodded to him and said,&quot;I-I mean.... you look really, and I mean reeeeally hot right now, sooo.... yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, it’s okay to be confused at first, but why not just take the night off to accept this new experience for you.&quot; Tabitha exclaimed<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.... I’m much more interested in you right now, Uh... Tabitha, and you’re... uh.... package.&quot; I replied awkwardly and Tabitha looked down and chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is that it now~? Well, I suppose in that case, how about I show you how two lovable guys have fun with one another~ Also, please call me Toby, it’s just... much more fitting, don’t you think handsome?&quot; He asked and I blinked twice then nodded to him and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, I certainly wouldn’t mind that, just tell me what to do.&quot; I replied and I saw a wide toothy smile appear on Toby&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Toby then instructed me to lay down and make myself comfortable on the bed, and so I did and I watched him lay down at my feet on his stomach. He then started prodding at my talons, eventually moving into a massage for both of my feet that made me moan and practically sink into the mattress. However it wasn’t until I felt Toby&#39;s slick formed tongue start stroking my feet that I started to feel horny, and I loved it. The feeling of his warm tongue between my toes, under my curved talons, and on the soles of my feet made me shudder with happiness. I slowly broke into a murring type sound at which Toby looked up at me and said,&quot;Someone’s feeling entertained.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded to Toby then moved up beside me, but still remained on his stomach. I then watched his tail lift up and flop onto his back and he smiled and said,&quot;Lay down on my legs now, and put your face where you see my ass now please.&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused for a moment, but I didn’t question him as I hesitantly laid down on him and was now looking directly at his twin cheeks. &quot;Now, open them up, and don’t be shy about it and when you get a clear view of my asshole start licking.&quot; Toby said grinning.<br />
<br />
I wasn’t sure about this at first, but my personal instincts felt that this was too good to pass up. So I put my hands on Toby&#39;s ass and opened up his cheeks until I saw a puckered tailhole looking back at me and my eyes widened. I never thought I was ever going to do what I was about to do, and as I stuck my tongue out and slowly made my way to lick his ass. The moment my tongue touched Toby’s hole my nose was filled with the wonderful foul smells of his ass, and the taste was unlike anything I’ve ever imagined in the past, and what’s more was that I liked it and yearned for it.<br />
<br />
I paused for a moment then I started licking more and more, and I continued to lick more intensely and got deeper with every stroke of my tongue. The taste of ass filled my mouth and I loved it, and Toby moaned out every time I made a deep enough lick. I found my muzzle completely planted up against Toby&#39;s puckered hole and every time I inhaled I got a whiff of that gorgeous, tasty ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh, Yeah~&quot; Toby moaned then he looked up at me and said,&quot;That’s enough now Joe, I think we should take this up a notch.&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused, mid-lick and I looked at Toby with my tongue still hanging out and watched him laugh. &quot;You have quite a talent for eating ass, I can’t wait to return the favor big boy.&quot; He chuckled then he instructed me to get down on hands and knees and lift my tail for him, and I responded accordingly getting onto the floor for him, and looked back to see him looming over me with a fully erect cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, this Is when things get hot!&quot; Toby growled then his claw came down and there was a loud smack as his claw whacked my ass causing me to clench my cheeks and whimper.<br />
<br />
Toby then chuckled and said,&quot;What? You didn’t think it would be easy did you? That’s what makes manly sex so hot, it’s the roughest kind around and everyone learns their place and loves it.&quot; <br />
<br />
With this I watched Toby thrust his cock forward and penetrate my rectum, and I roared loudly and moaned as my cock dripped with precum, and I could feel the throbbing pulse of Toby’s thick dragon meat inside of me. &quot;Oooh, god! You’re so... big!&quot; You yelled and Toby smiled and said,&quot;That’s not the half of it! When I mount you it’s going to be a workout just to keep a big hunk like me on you while I ram you full of cock!&quot;<br />
<br />
I imagined that happening right now and I stared off into space unprepared for Toby&#39;s next thrust as he forced himself onto me. I struggled to hold him up and I roared out as I orgasmed already and watched the thick ropes of cum splatter the floor, and Toby laughed at this and said,&quot;Alright huhh? Well looks like, we’re gonna have quite the mess when we’re done here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Toby then slowly got into a rhythm of pounding my ass and each time he got deeper and deeper into my tight rectum. His balls slapped mine with each thrust, and the satisfaction and lust were easily overpowering what little pain this gave me as I orgasmed two or three more times. It was then that Toby&#39;s claws clenched onto my ass as he thrusted deep into me and he let out a bellowing roar as well as me when we both climaxed into the night, and this caused the ground to vibrate and shake violently all around us <br />
<br />
Toby then sighed and with a grunt he pulled out of my now sore and cum filled asshole while I stood up and looked at the puddle of semen I had created. However despite all of the mess Toby kissed my cheek and nuzzled me happily. &quot;You’re such a good lover, Joe... will you be my.... heh.... mate?&quot; Toby asked and you blushed then smiled.<br />
<br />
I laughed and hugged Toby with all my might and said,&quot;Of course! Why wouldn’t I want such a perfect man in my life?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Toby laughed at this and we laid down on the bed and made out with each other again, curling our tails together and sharing how great we both were intimately laughing up a storm while doing so.<br />
<br />
Toby then sighed and said,&quot;Ah man, the neighbors are gonna kill me for all of this noise.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then peered over at Toby and said,&quot;Well, you can always stay with me! Or we could go out and find our own place together if you’d like!&quot;<br />
<br />
Toby chuckled at this and said,&quot;Well, aren’t you in a good mood tonight? I’m surprised you aren’t complaining about how sore your ass is after I demolished it!&quot;<br />
<br />
I whined and rubbed my ass and sighed,&quot;Yeah.... let’s find something else to do until that heals up.... so... what now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t know, but... well I’m beat! So if you don’t mind I’d like to share the a bed with my best man.&quot; Toby murred and I looked at him and smiled, blushing and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’d love to, it’ll be romantic.&quot; I added then Toby got up and turned off the lights.<br />
<br />
I then drew back the blankets and he got on in bed with me, and we proceeded to make out once more and I couldn’t seem to get the taste or smell of Toby out of my mind. Everything about him was just incredible to me at this moment that I completely forgot about the ring until he fell asleep holding me in his arms and I glanced down at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything I can do to make this better?&quot; I thought to myself then I smiled and whispered,&quot;....&quot;</p>
