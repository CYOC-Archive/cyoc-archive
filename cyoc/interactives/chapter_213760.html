<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Geoffrey sat next to Prince Gregory, inwardly stewing.<br />
<br />
He was having trouble remembering his life on Earth now. Even that mental block he’d put on his memories had been invaded by the polar bear. It was all starting to feel a bit like a dream and worse, fading like one as well. Pretty soon-a week, tops-he’d just be a very subservient dumb polar bear bodyguard.<br />
<br />
It terrified him.<br />
<br />
His new body barely answered to his commands, now. Letting the polar bear take over when doing menial tasks had been a mistake. Now his body was on autopilot all the time and he’d actually started enjoying the work! His mind would wander to Gregory and the polar bear’s heart rate would increase, his cock would harden and thoughts of fucking and being fucked would push any other thoughts out of Jeff’s mind.<br />
<br />
The others were talking about robbing shops while Geoffrey was having his existential crisis and all the polar bear wanted to do was scream. Or fuck Gregory. That was better. It was easier to just let the polar bear do all the thinking. Which is to say, not much. Thinking was painful and being scared was painful and the bear’s thoughts were soothing and calming and-<br />
<br />
Geoffrey shook his huge head. Fuck!<br />
<br />
“There it is, the skunk’s shop,” Hagerd, the fat middle-aged ram said, pointing a hooflet out the window.<br />
<br />
There were worse fates, Geoffrey concluded, looking at the ram. <br />
<br />
At least he wasn’t fat anymore. Gregory would not like that. And he loved-<br />
<br />
Geoffrey snarled and shook his head again. <br />
<br />
No one seemed to notice. They were talking about Paul-err, Palseks and her dragon and pregnancy fetish. Fucking pervert. Well, if there was a campaign where being very obvious about your fetish was allowed, this was it. At least he wasn’t into piss or scat. Geoffrey had no intention of wandering into a piss forest to battle the evil Whizz-ard.<br />
<br />
The shop outside was rather small but modern. Lots of white, smooth walls and stainless steel counters and glass. Geoffrey might have mistaken it for a high-end store in his world if he didn’t know any better. But even then, he couldn’t really remember the real world. The weirdest things stuck in his mind.<br />
<br />
A shop this high end was likely magical…which meant the person running it might also be magical. Or smart, at the very least. Smarter than Geoffrey was now. He was at a crossroads. Either he took this one or he took the eagle, who also looked smart. Both would offer him some relief from the polar bear thoughts.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want her to be useless because her brain is fried.” Charlie, the handsome black wolf rogue was saying, “You quaff it.”<br />
<br />
“Me?” Gregory stared at Charlie, appalled.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey took a breath.<br />
<br />
“I’ll do it.” Geoffrey growled. “Don’t sully yourself just yet, my liege.”<br />
<br />
“Just yet?” the mink sputtered, whiskers twitching.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey hid a smile. <br />
<br />
“You didn’t take the tiger’s essence or this one, so if we finish this shop in say, half an hour, yes. You’ll be the only one who can safely quaff essence.”<br />
<br />
“B-but-!”<br />
<br />
“You can be the eagle. He was quite handsome.” Hagerd boomed.<br />
<br />
Prince Gregory sagged. “Fine. Ugh, if the essence sticks and you stay a stink-butt, I’m not sure you can stay my boyf-my bodyguard, Geoffrey.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about me, my liege,” The polar bear winked. “Bottom’s up!”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey tasted the soul essence. He stiffened, eyes widening as his brain expanded. It was…it was…<br />
<br />
Liberating.<br />
<br />
Tastes assaulted him. Skunk musk, the bubbling of a cauldron, the smell of that hag, herbs and spices and powders and perfumes. Oddly, other things trickled in. The yelp of a boi as his cock entered him. The feeling of his paw running over a silk outfit. His dick spreading the pucker of a burly man, reducing him to a mewling twink.<br />
<br />
As he was lost in a sea of sensations and memories, Geoffrey began to shrink, slowly at first, then quickly. His short, dense white pelt grew into long, lush black and white fur. His little bear tail sprouted and the fur fanned out. The smell of skunk quickly filled the alley as his bottom half changed. By the time the transformation was finished, a short, cute, fluffy skunk man was standing in the alley, dressed in a floral tunic and purple pants.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Geoffrey’s voice was high and effeminate, “Nicolas is very gay!”<br />
<br />
It was pleasant, actually. Nicolas was confident and self-assured and loved himself. His personality was so…dominating for such a small creature. And the magic! He was magical! Geoffrey sighed in relief as spell formulas and alchemical recipes filled his mind.<br />
<br />
He could work with this.<br />
<br />
“The man who owns perfume shop is a homosexual. What a surprise.” Gregory rolled his eyes. “bet he’s a bottom, too.”<br />
<br />
“No.” Geoffrey said.<br />
<br />
“Wonders never cease,” Gregory rolled his eyes. “Open up his shop.”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey nimbly walked over to the backdoor and moved his paws in a strange, circular manner.<br />
<br />
“Combination magic lock.” He explained to the others.<br />
<br />
“Nicolas was a magic user?” Charlie said, surprised. “Good thing we didn’t force the kobold to drink. Or you’d be down one slave, Gregory.”<br />
<br />
“Please.” Gregory rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
The door opened and soft, delicate fragrances wafted out, competently covering up the skunk-stench.<br />
<br />
Inside were rows of jars and boiling pots and essences. It appeared Nicolas didn’t just do perfumes, he also did candles and incense. There was even an Alchemical kit set in the corner. Geoffrey grinned and sighed. He was home at last.<br />
<br />
But…in a few hours, he’d be back, trapped in the mind of a slutty, stupid muscle-bound polar bear.<br />
<br />
He…no, he couldn’t do it! It was like Flowers For Algernon, going back to being dumb was horrifying! Geoffrey had magic now. Even if he was a skunk, well, Nicolas memories told him it wasn’t so bad at all. He was powerful, dominating despite his small stature. Who cared if he had to give up the admittedly better body?<br />
<br />
The glass jar containing the rest of Nicolas’ soul essence clinked in his paw.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey looked at it. The soul inside glittered tantalizingly. Yes…if he drank the rest, he’d never have to worry about turning into that horrible polar bear ever again. Never have to be brow-beaten by some spoiled little fuck.<br />
<br />
There was the issue of him being overwhelmed by the personality inside…but wasn’t he already being overwhelmed by an even worse personality?<br />
<br />
Taking a breath and making sure the others didn’t see him, Geoffrey tossed the contents of the jar down his throat. Nothing happened for a moment. Then…<br />
<br />
Nicolas blinked, looking down at the empty jar. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Charlie waited impatiently as the skunk went inside and disarmed all the traps.<br />
<br />
What was taking him so long?<br />
<br />
The black-furred wolf sharpened a dagger while he waited. It was probably Geoffrey enjoying his new form and not wanting Gregory to know the stink-butt was hot. And he had to admit, the mephit did have a certain allure to him. <br />
<br />
When the well-dressed skunk walked out the door, he sighed in relief. At least the skunk hadn’t triggered any of his traps. He idly noticed that the soul jar was no longer in Geoffrey’s paws, but figured he’d set it down on the counter while he undid some of the traps.<br />
<br />
“All clear, my sexy companions,” Geoffrey said, winking at Charlie. “Go on in!”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, I cannot wait until you are out of that loathsome form!” Gregory scoffed, walking past the skunk.<br />
<br />
Charlie thought he saw the skunk smirk.<br />
<br />
“Coming, Charles?” Geoffrey asked, swishing his fluffy tail playfully.<br />
<br />
Charlie wandered over to the skunk as the others walked into the store. “You seem different.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Geoffrey said coyly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Charlie winked. “I like it. Don’t let Gregory get you down.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmph,” Geoffrey eyed Charlie, “I like you too. When you get into the shop, open my safe. The combination is 07-04-73.”<br />
<br />
“Got it.” Charlie said, walking past the skunk and into the shop. He felt a pinch on his rear and turned to see the skunk wink at him.<br />
<br />
“Say, uh, Geoffrey,” the wolf paused at the threshold. “You wanna take another sip and put that skunk cock to use tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Oh Charles, I think that sounds like a wonderful idea,” Geoffrey chuckled darkly. “Now hurry up. Don’t want to fall behind the others.”<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded, wondering at how commanding the polar bear’s new personality was. It was more than a little hot. His cock grew erect. Yeah, getting plowed by him tonight was going to be great.</p>
