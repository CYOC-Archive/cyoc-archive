<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasim's ten thousand dijinn were not angels. Not in the physical sense or metaphorical <br />
sense. Dijinn had an incredible amount of power, yet were bound by rules set in place by <br />
Allah. While the myth had been tamed by the west along with goblins, werewolves and <br />
vampires, the east had not lost it's sight of the true nature of the dijinn. The general <br />
consensus was anyone fool enough to ask wishes of a dijinn got what was coming to <br />
them, sadly, these attitude always failed to take into account that there was nothing <br />
keeping the dijinn with their absurdly ambiguous liberty in interpreting someone's wish, <br />
and a bored djinn would just smack a horrible fate in the ignorant victim outright, while a <br />
creative and imaginative one would figure out how to cause as much human misery as <br />
possible out of the wishes, the ones who considered them a bit more sadistic than most <br />
stringing them along with one or two wishes actually granted in reasonably SANE relations <br />
to the original wish.  In one of his rare proactive moments, Mike had as a personal 'reward' <br />
to the dijinn for their centuries of hard work, given a handful of them the ability to 'hear <br />
thoughts'... making it impossible for them to properly misinterpret the wish since they <br />
could hear what the victim MEANT by their words. These particular dijinn's hatred and <br />
anger grew by leaps and bounds and would often suffer massive Freudian slips when <br />
speaking to their would be victims. These dijinn due their inability now to property torture <br />
even the magically ignorant, were deemed almost useless by their fellow dijinn... and <br />
these pariah dijinn had no interested in socializing with the peri who would have been <br />
more than eager to teach them more constructive uses of their power.  Said Peri were <br />
currently treating Karther's victims captured by Jasim's dijinn with the upmost dignity and <br />
respect, as much as one could expect at any rate. <br />
<br />
Thus Jasim when he had recruited an army of entities who could turn the universe on it's <br />
head if they were allow unrestricted use of their power to take care of one fennec kitesune <br />
with an oversized ego and his collection of brainwashed victims, these djinn had jumped <br />
on eagerly. Lighting ants on fire was a pass time humans had learned from the dijinn. <br />
<br />
The dijinn had little love for Alleh's favorite work hand species (in the dijinn's opinion) but <br />
Jasim had given them a chance to blast even former humans to atoms, they weren't about <br />
to pass it up.  They amused themselves thinking of the annihilation they'd reek. And by <br />
their commanding officer's own self delusions, the angel of the jihad even making himself <br />
think that the Nazarene was apologizing for the kitesune's playthings having their <br />
meaningless free will being restored when the younger messenger was apologizing for <br />
their minds being altered and changed in the first place. The dijinn never saw why a big <br />
deal was made about these finite entities or their toys. Destroy the world? Ha! Destroy <br />
themselves? Of course. But destroy the world? Such fiction was as amusing as it was <br />
absurd... for now at least. <br />
<br />
When these esper dijinn had learned of the changing of their commander's material vessel, <br />
they all laughed. When they suddenly lost contact with their commanding officer. <br />
Thoughts of rescue were entertained only as long as necessary. And were quickly turned to <br />
how long they would have to wait, before they could safely begin to exterminate the lord <br />
of all fennec kitesune and those like human (meaning the former humans) without <br />
incurring the wrath of Michel and his posse. A handful of dijinn also comment on how <br />
since this would clearly mark operation return as a failure... they would need to destroy <br />
any humans nearby who had happened to see the kitesune as well... after all... memory <br />
rewrites could so often fail... better to be safe than sorry.... <br />

<br />
Tamthis smiled at the new creation, one that he believed was now part of the same soul <br />
as he but as interestingly different as the other fox/wolf personas in the soul's 'room.' <br />
&quot;You look splendid! Now come to us! Come help us fulfill Lord Karther's dream to <br />
transform the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf-fox that had been Kyriel nodded in agreement. She swayed towards the other of <br />
her &quot;kin&quot; and sat down on one of the armrests of Tamthis' chair. Here, she truly felt that <br />
she and the other beasts were as one... or did she? The wolf-fox frowned. While she DID <br />
feel as if she was complete and knew her Self, she couldn't help but feel a small 'knot' <br />
deep down in her being, as if this wasn't as perfect as she thought it was. Tamthis noticed <br />
her expression and smiled. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; he said, &quot;You are just adjusting to the power and <br />
dignity that is our soul. You'll feel better soon enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
The wolf-fox smiled, and pushed the worries over such a measly 'knot' out of her mind <br />
for the moment.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I should have seen this coming. How stupid of me!&quot; Julio could feel Keiko looking <br />
at him with a questioning gaze, &quot;Kyriel is a new soul, nothing more than a baby. She <br />
barely knows who she herself is yet, and was not even close to being ready to handle a guy <br />
who changes the &quot;Self&quot; of a person on a whim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She may not be her parents,&quot; Keiko rebutted, &quot;But she has the memories of both T' and <br />
Janice right? Wouldn't that make her even better than us at fixing Tamthis? Hell, if she <br />
couldn't, I'm not sure that the other angels and me could do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has memories yes,&quot; Julio said, his voice sounding more panicked due to the situation, <br />
&quot;but she doesn't have the experiences to go with them. It's one thing to KNOW about <br />
something, and it's a completely different thing to UNDERSTAND how that something <br />
works.&quot; Keiko  Akane were confused, and looked at him blankly. &quot;Think of it this way: you <br />
practice to get better at a fighting style. Why? Because you might be able to read how to <br />
do the moves in a book, but you'll still be useless at doing them if you don't actually <br />
experience the motions. This is somewhat the same case: The situation is so bizarre and <br />
unusual, you'd pretty much have to have prior experience at being transformed in order to <br />
truly grasp Tamthis' power, ESPECIALLY if you're going into his mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keiko, tell him to hurry up!&quot; Akane said hurriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Julio continued, &quot;Kyriel is in a mess because she has no clue who she is; she <br />
remembers T' and Janice and tried to make a purpose for herself through those memories, <br />
but that isn't HER purpose; she thinks of herself more as an amalgam than a single being. <br />
If you let her just rely on memories, then what would make her choose her human and <br />
angel memories over the ones that Tamthis is probably injecting into her, especially since <br />
he obviously has a stronger influence in his own mind? Keiko, Akane, she NEEDS to realize <br />
her own Self; and find what makes her not a piece of Tamthis, not an amalgam of T' and <br />
Janice, but Kyriel the angel.&quot;<br />
<br />
(by alex warlorn)<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Akane.... &quot; Said Keiko as she worked on the web of magic of Karthis in an all <br />
out direct assault with her sister. &quot;It's rather selfless that you chose to come along for all <br />
this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Akane asked without glance over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes really. It was so brave, so noble.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not as brave and noble as you beautiful, you didn't need to come here and yet you did. <br />
Now that's wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Why thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So what was your name before you were altered?&quot; Akira asked shifting out of her male <br />
form and it was a mixed blessing when he lost the school girl uniform. <br />
<br />
&quot;Akio.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That mean male heir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually it means 'manly hero.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pity... because you would make a great princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko blushed. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes really. You are so beautiful, so graceful, so lovely, it's a crime ye are not a princess.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... yes... it is... oh my prince.&quot; Said the humanoid vixen leaning on the rail of the high <br />
tower's balcony. She swayed up to the manly sage in her harem garb slowly embracing <br />
him, enjoying the feeling of his strong arms around her. &quot;My prince... kiss me... be one <br />
with me so I might be a princess and you might be Sultan...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my perfect love...&quot; The prince began to lean closer to the common girl. <br />
<br />
'Oh no you don't!' Julio the tick narrow all eight of his eyes, and jumped to a more <br />
sensitive park of Keiko's ear and delivered the most universal remedy for a enchantment in <br />
progress: good old fashioned pain! And delivered it with a CHOMP! And on top of that did <br />
the quickest creation hacking job he had done in his life using the blooding sharing <br />
between him and Keiko as a back door. <br />
<br />
&quot;YEOW!&quot; The kitesune female instantly scratched at the tick with her hind leg... then <br />
realized she HAD hind legs again. As the romantic tower she and Akira had been on was a <br />
giant a pile of sand again. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck just happened?&quot; Akira shook his head, leaning his tails over his head and <br />
counting them to make sure he had five, he did.  <br />
<br />
The twitching tick on the sand pile said mentally, 'That's what happens when you get <br />
distracted at hacking, or just plain rush a job.. if not for the fail safe I installed in my spirit <br />
eons ago I'd have ended up a part of your little romance story just from doing that kind of <br />
quick job from all the security precautions installed in this place's curse.'<br />
<br />
Keiko shook her head, she hadn't even realized... when DID she transform into a humanoid <br />
vixen? She hadn't even noticed the change! She counted her paws confirming her normal <br />
four. She looked at Akira confirming the same number. <br />
<br />
'Look.. I'm sorry Miss Gun-Ho decided to do collateral damage but RUSHING into it only <br />
caught you caught up in this place's story... it was using you as a new foundation!'<br />
<br />
Keiko looked around, and saw some humanoid fennec and wolves who bumped into each <br />
other wondering what was going on, having been work hands in the tower that had <br />
existed for all of thirteen minutes. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what's next?&quot; Keiko asked somewhat belittled. <br />
<br />
'First get me off the ground before someone steps on me...' Keiko complied using her tail <br />
as a tiny grip. 'Next.... I'm gonna take a nap... channeled way too much through this small <br />
body way too fast... wake up if the world ends or is saved okay?' The tick closed all eight <br />
of it's eyes. <br />
<br />
The two, four legged, five tailed kitesune looked at each other and nodded. No mistakes <br />
this time. One step at a time. They were gonna tear down this fake city brick by brick if <br />
they had to!<br />
<br />
The people were acting more and more and more erratic, people wandering about blinding <br />
and/or babbling nonsense. People walking into walls or each other, people waving at <br />
others in the opposite direction or simply dumbly starting into space as Tamthis' own <br />
mind began to become conflicted. And this.. left the city itself... more than distracted <br />
enough for the two kitesune to make a SECOND assault on it's structure... <br />
<br />

<br />
Of course, Jasmine had made a tactical error by killing Roberta, since the whole point of <br />
fighting Roberta had been to distract Tamthis and thus divide his attention and power in <br />
two through himself and his puppet. Now Tamthis had no such distractions. She made a <br />
second mistake by attacking Kyriel's body was still totally limp. Of course it was perfectly <br />
logical to disable Kyriel's body before Tamthis could use it to his advantage, but this again <br />
narrowed down Tamthis' concentration, since Kyriel's body at the moment, was merely a <br />
flesh and blood shell with Kyriel still inside Tamthis with her shell merely harmonizing with <br />
her being mixed in with Tamthis.   As it was, Kyriel's body flew like a rag doll through the <br />
air and hit a wall in the throne room hitting a mural of naked marble vixen and fell over a <br />
broken and bloody mess on the other side of the wall. <br />
<br />
Of course, Roberta's death sent a shock wave. <br />
<br />
 +++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Roberta... she's dead...&quot; The wolf/vixen Kyriel whispered with shock and surprise. <br />
<br />
The wolf beasts didn't even respond. Doll Tammy wondered how they even related to her. <br />
Queen Tammia just shrugged. Lady Tammia stood in shock. Tamthis said, &quot;Those who <br />
sacrifice for us will not be in vain! We will bring the entire world under our command!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Most... illogical.&quot; The Super Ego said very matter of fact. <br />
<br />
&quot;Roberta... she was originally one of the male guards... she wasn't one of the sisters but... <br />
father promised, no wait a minute, -I- promised to save them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we shall.&quot; Lady Tammia said, still squatting within the Id. &quot;We shall bring all under <br />
our ideal rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... how many have to die...&quot; The Vixen Wolf said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not many, our victory will be swift and concise!&quot; Tamthis declared. <br />
<br />
&quot;The German people were told that the war would be over by Christ Mass.&quot; The wolf/vixen <br />
Kyriel said in a moment of absolute clarity. &quot;And Hitler forgot a very important fact... one <br />
of many...&quot; She glared at Tamthis, &quot;You can't fight the entire world. This is crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone gasped at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-wha-what is this-?!&quot; Tamthis declared on top of his royal throne stacked on top of <br />
countless arm chairs. &quot;Woman I shall not have such defeatist talk!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It is not defeatist, but a matter of accepting truth and the presented facts.&quot; The Super Ego <br />
said properly. <br />
<br />
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; Sharled Tamthis, rather silly consider the Super Ego was still blind folded and <br />
gagged. &quot;We shall bring order! Peace! And glory to the Fennec Kitesune and take back in <br />
interest our homeland!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Order? Peace?&quot; Said Lady Tammia, &quot;That sounds like a lot of work.&quot; Her voice started to <br />
become a duel voice, one male, one female, &quot;I just wanna have fun!&quot; Lady Tammia shook <br />
her head, &quot;I think he's starting to separate from me again...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let'em!&quot; Said the doll Tammy, &quot;He's really fun! He's certainly more fun than any of you <br />
guys.&quot; <br />
<br />
The King and Queen wolf beasts snarls and howled at the doll Tammy who yelped and <br />
leaped away from the main group some. <br />
<br />
The Wolf/Vixen Kyriel walked over to the Super Ego unopposed. Even as Queen Tammia <br />
helped Lady Tammia back onto the wall locking her back into the wall as she and the Id <br />
started to separate again... the Id separated .... he was a naked wolf man... yet he wasn't a <br />
hulk muscle beasts like the wolf things... he had intelligence in his eyes, as much as the Id <br />
could have at least, and he began to snarl again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see some progress, some great progress.&quot; Said Tamthis looking at the new wolf being. <br />
&quot;And who are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy!&quot; The Id snarled, &quot;Tommy the terrible! With all this power! Why would you want to <br />
rule over a kingdom or whatever? We can have all the fun and games we want! This is <br />
stupid!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not all that much progress.&quot; Queen Tammia muttered. <br />
<br />
The wolf/Vixen Kyriel moved closed to the Super Ego who made no reaction to her coming <br />
closer. She leaned closer to her, and began to whisper to him, and he began to whisper <br />
back. She began to flow into him. <br />
<br />
Everybody heard, but nobody really understood save the Id and Ego the low voices the two <br />
were speaking in. <br />
<br />
'Your mind, to my mind. Your thoughts, to my thoughts.' <br />
<br />
They flowed into each other, and just as the Id, the Super Ego's form became that of the <br />
Wolf/Vixen Kyriel. <br />
<br />
Queen Tammia helped the Wolf/Vixen Kyriel down as soon as the merger was complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do it?&quot; She had to know. <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I simply understand him better than you.&quot; She said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well done myself!&quot; Tamthis declared, &quot;Now nothing stands in our way of continuing our <br />
goals to bring about our future!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I....&quot; The wolf/vixen rubbed her eyebrows, &quot;Think not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; All of the different aspects said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have observed our collective methods and instruments, and have come to the conclusion <br />
that this continued methodology for reclaiming of our homeland shall ultimately be self-<br />
defeating and leave the kitesune fennec with even less influence in the world than before, <br />
and even be considered outcasts by the other kitesune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you say such a thing!&quot; Tamthis hissed, &quot;We are united as one in our cause!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And I can see rather clearly, that the means by which we are seek to bring about our <br />
cause shall result in nothing less than the complete eradication of the fennec kitesune <br />
society, the complete destruction of Karthis city, and in our ultimate final termination as <br />
well, continuing in this manner is completely irrational and is a betrayal of the fennec <br />
kitesune whose leadership we have taken from Karther.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Taken?&quot; Lady Tammia asked not unable to comprehend Karther no longer existed. <br />
<br />
&quot;HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS?&quot; Tamthis said, this was not what was supposed to <br />
happen at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's actually rather simple when you think about.&quot; Said the Wolf/Vixen said, &quot;One, is that <br />
since I am the source of our angelic power, opposed to our kitesune magic or the wolf <br />
curse... thus I am sane... I am able to see the flaws in Karther's goals, his methods, and <br />
our system. We should release all our victims at once, and beg Jehova for forgiveness for <br />
these actions and with hope we can still gather a handful of willing recruits who don't want <br />
to return to murdering each other. For by forcing them upon them, we have created a <br />
subconscious resentment towards it, since it is the nature of the sentient mind. While it <br />
desires comfort over freedom, CONFINEMENT is a completely different story, which is what <br />
our city is. Our city can not change or adapt with new situations. To maintain this perfect <br />
order we have completely stripped our citizens of nearly all free will reducing them to <br />
robots who can not function in something as dynamic as the real world.  There's also the <br />
possibility that by joining with the Super Ego that I've been given much greater level of <br />
objectivity in my thinking then any of you. Which is possibly was it's goal in allowing me to <br />
do so in the first place, knowing I would be able to think rationally. Also, there's the small <br />
chance, that I know the memory of my father would never let me sleep at night if I allowed <br />
Jasmine to be able to say 'Told ya so' on my father's last mission he took part in!&quot;  <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
In reality, Tamthis was feeling a horrible headache, he brought up several large walls of <br />
sand stone around himself between himself and Jasmine. As his brain was forced to <br />
process the single most horrible thing imagination: truth. This horrible, HORRIBLE sense of <br />
clarity began to tear at his mind as he began to see his kingdom for the empty clockwork <br />
doll collection it was. And that couldn't be. He couldn't allow it to be. It could not be. <br />
&quot;AGGGH! No! No! NO!&quot; The king of all desert foxes snarls in anger at his own thoughts. <br />
<br />
Jasmine blinked wondering just what was going on. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Alexandra was no warrior, had never been a warrior, and had no desire to be a warrior. <br />
Lisa gave her an engraved single action revolve. &quot;Don't worry, the bullets will refill on their <br />
own, this won't jam like an automatic would. Just point and pull the trigger.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lisa leaned down next to Kathy brushed the harem vixen forehead and whispered in her <br />
ear, &quot;It's okay, we aren't going to kill the one you love, your king is just sick, we're going to <br />
help him be well again, that's all we want.&quot; Kathy's fitful unconscious state changed to <br />
actually slumber.  &quot;Sweet dream.&quot; Lisa stood up and leaned down next to Jennifer instead.  <br />
&quot;Don't worry, if you don't want to run away from old age then you don't need to. After this <br />
is all over I promise you can get the body back you've fought the wars worth fighting in. <br />
But we need you to keep your head down for now, don't worry, everything is going to be <br />
all right.....&quot; Lisa stood up as Jennifer's own unconscious state became real sleep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra, look after them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa....&quot;<br />
<br />
The angel gave the kitesune vixen her full attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's going to happen to me when this is all over? This life... it may have been a lie <br />
but... I felt more alive in it then the one I was suckered out of... and Karther... he gave it to <br />
me... he made me more happy than I can remember being in my dreams... Lisa, what'll <br />
happen to me at the end of the day?&quot;<br />
<br />
The angelic fox put a hand on the kitesune vixen's shoulder and smiled, &quot;That's your own <br />
choice.&quot; <br />
<br />
And putting in some final fail safes to keep the barrier up a bit longer after she left, Lisa <br />
sped to her comrades who needed her. <br />
<br />
Holding the revolver Alexandra sat down against the wall and with her free hand ruffled <br />
Kathy's hair and sighed, 'My prince... blast it, I'll shall miss you. Good-bye my prince. I'm <br />
sorry.' <br />
<br />

<br />
Natalie was nothing if not determined, regardless of her current form.  Erica and Luna <br />
gasped when the massive she wolf beast came right out of the sandstone floor and grab <br />
them both by the leg trying to pull them back into the earth with her, only with super <br />
humanly strong and fast kicks prevented that from happen as the two angel vixens leapt <br />
from where the she-wolf beast emerged. <br />
<br />
&quot;GREAT! She can phase through walls too!&quot; Erica cursed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not just her!&quot; Luna pointed, the horde of wolf beasts began to go through the walls as if <br />
they were water. Then again, they WERE just souls inside sand constructs made to look like <br />
wolf beasts. <br />
<br />
A beam of light from where hit the wall which exploded sending the pieces of male wolf <br />
beasts inside everywhere completely disorienting them, and trapping many inside pieces <br />
of melted sand now glass.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Vicki now holding a longbow. &quot;We don't have time for this!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad.&quot; Lucy... her injuries were completely gone... the sand had healed her, she came <br />
in flying in straight through the hole in the ceiling. All four vixens sprang back from her <br />
impact point on the floor. Luna pressed herself against a wall that Natalie emerged from a <br />
second later grabbing Luna in a shoulder hug trapping her arms. Luna formed titanium <br />
punching daggers on her heals which she stabbed into the parts of Natalie's emerged <br />
body, making the beast let her go for a moment and Luna formed punching daggers on <br />
the front of her feet and fists, sticking sharpened pieces of metal into Natalie's giant <br />
muscle bound body from toes to fingers in a matter of seconds. The sand instantly began <br />
to fill in the repair the damage.  Luna was sick to death of this. She tore her crucifix off <br />
from around her neck and pressed it deep into Natalie's forehead the way a vampire slayer <br />
would a wooden stake into a Nosferatu's heart. &quot;EEEEEEAGGGH~!&quot; Luna screamed with <br />
exertion pouring her aura into Natalie's forcing out the massive layers of curses now <br />
swimming through her sister's body and soul.... 'Please let her be something of her left in <br />
there.' <br />
<br />
The Alpha Female of the wolf pack of Karthis City screamed howled and snarled at the <br />
strange unnatural feelings running through it, it's pitch reaching a high of insanity!  Luna <br />
felt the mismush of curses and enchantments on Natalie madly rip at tear at Luna's own <br />
self in like a mindless animal. <br />
<br />
&quot;I AM SUCH AN IDIOT!&quot; Viki cursed, &quot;I forgot to remove her brainwashing when I KO'ed <br />
her!&quot; 'What kind of big sister am I supposed to be-?!' <br />
<br />
Lucy meanwhile attacked Vicki with reckless abandon, becoming more chaotic even as her <br />
master did. Her thoughts becoming increasingly random as the spells holding the city <br />
together that she was now a part of were torn apart from the inside out. Lucy began to <br />
cackle madly. <br />
<br />
Vicki formed her longbow into a double ended sword keeping her crucifix wrapped up in <br />
her other hand. &quot;ERICA! LISA! GO! Lucy's my responsibility! I'm the one who promised to <br />
save her! GO!&quot;   <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not abandoning you or Luna!&quot; Erica snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'S AN ORDER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica saw the wolf beasts beginning to come to the rescue of her alpha female. &quot;Oh no you <br />
don't!&quot; Erica created a napalm bomb and threw it at the ceiling, the intense heat turing it <br />
to glass. <br />
<br />
&quot;You heard her!&quot; Lisa grabbed Erica and the two angel vixens flew not bothering to run <br />
right past their biggest sister and her sister who was now a mockery of what they had <br />
themselves become.  They could FEEL where Jasmine was easily enough.. but they didn't <br />
know the way through the palace halls...Erica grabbed Lisa in turn and vibrated her shell's <br />
molecules to the point where they were able to vibrate through the walls... Erica and Lisa <br />
both felt sick on the other side when they passed through one of the walls containing a <br />
soul of one of the people turned into sand statues to act as regulations to keep the city's <br />
kitesune magic stable enough to function on such a large scale... <br />
<br />
&quot;UGH!&quot; Erica almost threw up at the warped mindset the poor soul had been left with. <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise Kyriel we'll get there in time.&quot; Lisa said. ... 'Promise...' Lisa realized, 'I just <br />
promised.... ' The feel weight of what she had just done hit her. She had -promised- she <br />
was an Angel... promises weren't made unless an angel intended to keep it... no matter <br />
what. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry all of you...&quot; Lisa blinked away tears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa?&quot; Erica looked her sister confused. <br />
<br />
Lisa threw a napalm bomb at the sand stone wall ahead of them, then took a war hammer <br />
and smashed it to pieces. Releasing the soul that had been inside to the next life. &quot;Forgive <br />
me. But I've now made a promise to be there in time to help my little sister no matter <br />
WHAT!&quot;   <br />
<br />
Erica stood in absolute shock as demure Lisa began to tear a path of destruction through <br />
the palace, it's being the best Erica could do to keep up, going to where Kyriel was like the <br />
crow flies. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen this is not a hoax! I repeat this is NOT a hoax! Ladies and <br />
gentlemen! Less than an hour ago countless computer programs claimed to be unknown <br />
even to our software staff and that of countless other TV Networks and military personal, <br />
shut down and became visible on their respective directories! Even more fantastic, weather <br />
satellites confirm an unknown structure in the middle eastern desert! Numerous other <br />
structures in supposedly abandoned or desolate parts of the world have become visible all <br />
around the world!! The military nor the president have yet to offer comment!&quot; <br />
<br />
In London,  Charlene and her family watched the TV news with more shock than surprise. <br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody finally went through with it.&quot; Charlene signed. <br />
<br />
A friend of Charlene form work came through the door without knocking, &quot;Hey Charlie you <br />
see the news what ya think-&quot; He stared, &quot;What the heck! What happened to you?!&quot;  <br />
Charlene's friend exclaimed, actually recognizing the foxes as Charlie and Angie but at the <br />
same time his brain actually registering on the conscious level that they were fox people. <br />
<br />
&quot;I got kidnapped by a perverted fox prince and nearly got erased from existence.&quot; <br />
Charlene said completely passively. <br />
<br />
Her friend blinked a couple of times and said, &quot;.... Why didn't ya try to sell a crazy <br />
experience like that to the tabloids?&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlene groaned, Andrew sighed, Jennifer giggled. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Barbera in San Francisco with her own family stood amazed at the screen.  &quot;Well.&quot; Barbera <br />
said, &quot;There goes the neighborhood.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;ENOUGH~!!!&quot; Tamthis boomed at the Vixen/Wolf Kyriel, the two King and Queen Wolf <br />
beasts charges and tackled her, suddenly free of their chains. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
In reality, Tamthis screamed, his sandstone barrier shattering. <br />
<br />
Jasmine blinked... something about Tamthis was different... he look... angry... more than <br />
that... he almost looked feral. He took one step at a time, growling, &quot;I do not fear you <br />
angel! I do not fear ANYTHING! With the power I now have I have no NEED to fear! I have <br />
access to both sides of power! You can't win!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jasmine wondered what had caused Tamthis to begin to act this strangely when he totally <br />
had Jasmine outclass-?! Then she saw, his aura was going completely hay-wire! <br />
<br />
Tamthis slashed at her with his claws, he was a good several feet out of range for that... <br />
but a bull sized shadow of a wolf's paw formed in front of the fennec kitesune king and <br />
nearly smacked Jasmine through several walls and right out of the palace! Instead it merely <br />
slashed the room in half, several line now running through the walls. One had come <br />
dangerously close to cutting Kryiel's limb body in pieces. <br />
<br />
Tamthis snarled, and a WAVE of spiked sand wolf head bursted from the floor in front of <br />
him, Jasmine flew, they would have torn her to pieces if they had made contact. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP!&quot; The Kyriel wolf/vixen screamed then kicked the two giant beasts away from her <br />
who hit the floor and bounced. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, that didn't look very cool.&quot; The fake looking Tammy blinked confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am lord of this house! How can you command my beasts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm you now remember?&quot; The wolf/vixen said. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I WILL RULE THE DESERT AND ALL THAT LIVES IN IT! You hear?! I WILL! I WILL! I WILL!&quot; <br />
Tamthis screamed creating a bus sized sludge hammer and swimming it around as if it <br />
was made out of Styrofoam but left very solid impression when it missed Jasmine and sent <br />
food splattering everywhere when it hit the dinner room table instead. <br />
<br />
Jasmine hadn't said anything in the last several minutes, she couldn't get a word in <br />
edgewise and Tamthis began to rant and rave endlessly. <br />
<br />
Mundane wolves made out of sand began to drop from the ceiling like drops of water, <br />
slashing and biting at Jasmine as much as each other. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You know!&quot; The Vixen/Wolf shouted at the Id, &quot;Those beasties really resemble you... I <br />
betting they belong to you a lot more than him.&quot; She pointed at the fox king on the <br />
throne. <br />
<br />
&quot;I AM NOT A 'HIM!' I am Tamthis!&quot; <br />
<br />
However.. the wolf beasts looked at each other confused, as tiny bits of them became <br />
sand and began to float over to the id... in a stark reversal of become when the different <br />
parts of Tamthis entered a piece of Tommy and began Tamthis... now the wolf beasts <br />
when joining with Tommy's Id were not becoming the Wolf Beasts but becoming the Id! <br />
<br />
&quot;How can this happening!&quot; Queen Tammia shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's actually kinda simple.&quot; The Vixen/Wolf said, &quot;I infected your totally insane and <br />
fragmented mind with -reason- the last thing your state of mind needed to continue to <br />
function the way it is... thus, you're beginning to suffer high levels of mental stress as <br />
you're being forced to behold the truth of yourselves, your own actions and everything <br />
elf... it is simply logical and...&quot; The Vixen/Wolf began to echo in a male voice, &quot;I think my <br />
time is just about up....&quot;<br />
<br />
The Vixen/Wolf fell down... and the Vulcan... STILL totally a Vulcan stood tall and proper <br />
with his arms behind his back still blind folded and gagged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don't!&quot; Queen Tammia grabbed at the Vulcan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vulcan Death Grip.&quot;  The vulcan said plainly grabbing her face and throw her face several <br />
yards. <br />
<br />
Kyriel's had to say it, &quot;There's no such thing as the 'vulcan death grip'...&quot; <br />
<br />
Vulcan said plainly, &quot;Indeed... but I doubted that they knew that.&quot; <br />
<br />
'So what message do you want her to give to your family?' <br />
<br />
'That I love them, that I've always loved them, and to accept my sisters as family too if <br />
they'll have them. Oh, and to tell dad that I think I'd appreciate watching Deep Space Nine <br />
with him now. And Maggie she's the cutest woman I've ever met.' <br />
<br />
The memory drifted through Kyriel's mind... also now partially Tamthis' mind.... <br />
<br />
The Vixen/Wolf blinked a couple time and said, &quot;Sisko.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tamthis asked.<br />
<br />
The vixen wolf stood up on shaking legs. &quot;Thinking about it now... I think Sisko was cooler <br />
than Kirk or Picard. I'm guess you'd like Kirk more cause he was more of a lady's man... <br />
but Sisko in my humble opinion had more character development. While I do feel the <br />
writers made some mistakes by having the Prophet -posses- his birth mother possibly <br />
without her consent... I do feel the way Sisko slowly accepted his statue as the Emissary <br />
through the series was rather well done. ... I do see what mom saw in Picard with him <br />
being a 'realistic' age for the captain of a flag ship, but I feel Sisko due to his lesser <br />
position faced some more slightly unique situations.&quot;  <br />
 <br />
Lady Tammia didn't believes this, &quot;What meaningless tripe is this-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just something I thought of when I remember mom's note she wanted me to give to her <br />
family, she mentioned DS9 in it and it made me think about those memories a bit more. <br />
She as Jake sat THROUGH the show more than watched it... but I think I'd actually enjoy it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey that actually sounds kinda cool... I remember Klingon sex is actually kinda kinky.&quot; <br />
The artificial looking Tammy coming over the wolf/vixen Kyriel who calmly touch <br />
Tammy... who in a flash of white light turned into a fox plushie toy that the Wolf/Vixen <br />
Kryriel picked up and hugged with one arm. &quot;Shush it's okay...&quot; The wolf/vixen ruffled the <br />
toy's faux fur as if it understood her, &quot;You belong here now, you're not an invader <br />
anymore...&quot;<br />
<br />
The vixen/wolf looked up at the fennec king on the towering throne. Who was speech less <br />
as the others including the still dissolving wolves.   &quot;You only have two choices left <br />
Tamthis... you either let yourself become a part of Tommy... or you'll be obliterated...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GET OUT!!!&quot; Tamthis bellow, sending a window with the force of a hurricane which blasted <br />
one of the walls of the living room out revealing the sand dunes underneath a starry sky. <br />
<br />
The Vulcan stood in front of the fox/wolf whose fur ruffled in the wind who otherwise <br />
stood his ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe,&quot; The vulcan said addressing Kyriel, &quot;You have been ignoring a rather logical <br />
question as to the state of your arrival.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kryiel blinked... and realized. &quot;I've been lying to myself... ... No matter what knowledge I <br />
was born with... I'm still less than a  day old... I'm not a baby, because a baby does not <br />
understand... but...&quot; The fox/vixen began to MELT... like paint hit by turpentine the form <br />
began to melt away and become goo on the floor. &quot;I'm still just a kid. Dad -trusted- me <br />
and I almost let him down. Mom -trusted- me against her better judgement and I nearly <br />
screwed up everything with no way to fix it.... because I thought I could just skip to being <br />
an adult.&quot; <br />
<br />
The vixen/wolf form finished melting away, still holding the fox plushie which she handed <br />
to the Vulcan who would hand it to the Id where it belonged. <br />
<br />
The little girl vixen in the fur closed her eyes and sighed as a pair of wings made out of <br />
shades of light sprung from her back. Two curved blades formed in either hand, with a <br />
link at the base that could enable them to join into a bow when need be.  &quot;Dad always <br />
wanted people to remember there's no such thing as 'no choice.' Mom was willing to do <br />
whatever she had to make sure those she loved were okay.&quot; Kyriel blinked away tears as <br />
she glared up at Tamthis with the fury only a child -could- have, &quot;They gave up <br />
EVERYTHING they were, and WOULD BE, just so I could -exist-!!! I won't let you take that <br />
away!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am lord and master of this house and no other!&quot; Tamthis bellowed.... suddenly... Lady <br />
Tammia and Queen Tammia where in his hand by their throats... he crushed into necks <br />
into fragments... they turned to sand and flew into his body... he grew larger. Their <br />
screams of horror and dismay echoed through the living room and the nightly desert <br />
beyond. &quot;I will consume you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not gonna let that happen!&quot;  The vixen cherub snapped back. <br />
<br />
&quot;LET happen?&quot; Lord King Tamthis said in frustrated and annoyed tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unlike you, I have friends and family I don't need to brainwash to know I can count on <br />
them!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Erica and Lisa came to the hole made by Kryiel's body, looking strangely smaller than <br />
before, and beyond it, they saw the throne room... with Jasmine using technique that put <br />
anything they could to pitiful shame to fend off attacks by someone who could only be <br />
Tamthis surrounded by an aura that made as much sense as a neo-post-modern-melo-<br />
drama and throwing attacks at the veteran angel that could be described as the drawings <br />
and carving of a deranged maniac brought into reality. <br />
<br />
Lisa took a look at Kyriel shell while Erica keep her eyes on the battle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Kyriel?&quot; Lisa wondered. Erica didn't need to ask what she meant. Their <br />
transmutation into part of the Race Of Messengers and again into Soldiers in Heaven's <br />
Army had left them with no delusions about what was themselves and what was just <br />
window dressing.  But Lisa still felt alarm at wondering where Kyriel was and why she had <br />
left her shell so utterly vulnerable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fighting on the inside I think...&quot; Erica pointed at Tamthis who couldn't seem to shut up on <br />
how 'of course he was right.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Then that's where I'm going.&quot; Lisa said without a second thought. The body that had been <br />
violated by Karther, and had left her with so much shame at that violation, she strangely <br />
didn't feel that scared or worried about stepping out of to save her little sister who she <br />
had barely had a chance to get to know yet. (Which was all the more reason to help her so <br />
they'd have the chance later.)  She looked at Erica, &quot;You coming to?&quot;</p>
