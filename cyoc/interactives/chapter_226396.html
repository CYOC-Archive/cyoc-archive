<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley watches as the two girls, unaware that one of them, the one who the boy thinks is his crush Amy, is actually a boy, who transformed himself to cheer up Sarah, enter the phone-store, keeping his distance, careful not to be noticed by the two girls, Riley follows them into the store, taking his phone out.<br />
<br />
The 15-year-old opens the App and activates the scanner, after a while his phone “pings” signalling him that everyone in the mall has been scanned. Scrolling through the files, Riley soon find Sarah’s file, deciding to first make her forget that he is a creepy-psycho opens her stats and edits the pink haired girl’s file. Riley simply moves his name from Sarah’s “hate” list to her “like” list, after confirming the change and smiling when he sees Sarah shake her head and look somewhat confused, the boy then returns to the file-screen and scrolls through the files, trying to find a file labelled “Amy”. Riley starts to become confused as he is unable to find Amy’s file, “that’s weird,” the boy mumbles to himself, “I’m sure every single person in this building is scanned, otherwise the App wouldn’t have given off a signal. So, why isn’t Amy showing up?”<br />
<br />
“How long do you need to choose a phone, Jeff,” Riley then hears Sarah say.<br />
<br />
‘Jeff? What the…,’ he thinks to himself, looking up from his phone and over to the two girls.<br />
<br />
“Sarah,” he hears the small girl, who he believes is Amy, “these phones all look so… girly.”<br />
<br />
Riley hears Sarah groan, “really, Jeff,” the pink haired girl says, “that is simply how phones nowadays are designed!”<br />
<br />
The 15-year-old is so confused, ‘why is Sarah, calling Amy “Jeff”,’ he asks himself, ‘that… that’s a boy’s name! Could… could it be… no, it can’t… but… it would make so much sense! I mean… she always rejected me… if what I assume is going on is correct, then I understand WHY she never wanted to start something with me!’<br />
<br />
Wanting to know, Riley scrolls through the files until he finds the only file that has the name “Jeff” labelled, so he opens the file and starts to read the stats. As he reads the stats the boy nods to himself, as if agreeing to what he had thought, ‘I thought so, I guess my suspicion was right,’ he thinks to himself, ‘that is why she never wanted to start something with me: she is not really a girl, she’s in reality a boy who transformed himself into a girl, I guess he only does it from time to time.’<br />
<br />
Riley looks up at the two girls, instead of feeling put off or disgusted that his crush is in reality a boy, the 15-year-old feels his cock twitch and a smile appears on his face, ‘the thought of fucking a 16-year-old boy is kind of fun,’ he thinks to himself, ‘though, I do prefer his “Amy” form, but… I would not mind fucking him when he’s his normal self. SHE is mine, no matter what, I just need to tweak HER a little in my favour!’<br />
<br />
The 15-year-old starts to type, editing Jeff’s file, in his mind there is only one Amy, if he would have read the transformation history of Jeff, he would have realized that what he thought is false, but since he’s fully convinced that Jeff had always been “Amy” he doesn’t care to check, unaware that the real Amy is lying in bed with an illness.<br />
<br />
Riley first adds “Amy” to Jeff’s name, which will cause Jeff to react to both names in the same way, next Riley changes Jeff’s “attracted to” from “athletic boys and girls” to “athletic Hispanic boys, especially Riley Alvarez”. He then moves to Jeff’s relationship status, which he leaves as “single”, ‘with my alteration of both Amy and Sarah about me, I suspect Amy will want to give me a chance, to proof that I am not such a creep as she thought,’ the boy thinks to himself. Riley then adds a special section and types, “prefers being Amy than being Jeff, only transforms into Jeff when not around Sarah or Riley”, he also adds that Jeff likes girly stuff and doesn’t mind if something is “girly”-designed.<br />
<br />
After editing, Riley reads through Jeff’s stats, he then nods, satisfied with the changes, ‘if I should need to change anything else, I can do that later or whenever,’ he thinks to himself, ‘for now, this should do it’.<br />
<br />
Riley confirms the changes he had made to Jeff and Sarah, and watches as the two girls stumble a little, assuming that their minds have adjusted, causing them to get a little dizzy. The boy decides to wait a while before approaching them, giving the two girls time to adjust.<br />
<br />
The 15-year-old watches as “Amy” looks up at Sarah, he then hears her asking, “Sarah, I was thinking… don’t… don’t you think we should give Riley a chance? I mean… he hasn’t really done anything harmful, he also never threatened me. He is really handsome, and the type of boy I’m attracted to. I would like to give him a chance, and see how it goes, but if you think I should stay away from him… I mean… you are the oldest of us two and have more experience than me, when it comes to relationships”.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Riley’s editing, Jeff is unaware that he is acting as though he has always been “Amy”, ‘something feels off,’ the former boy thinks to himself, ‘but I just can’t figure out what that is’.<br />
<br />
Riley watches as Sarah tilts her head, a thoughtful expression on her face, “I guess it couldn’t hurt,” he hears her say, “as the saying goes: never judge a book by its cover. So, yeah, I agree that you should give him a chance”.<br />
<br />
The 15-year-old smiles to himself as he hears all this, ‘looks like my change to their minds worked like a charm,’ he thinks to himself, ‘now, all I have to do is make sure not to come across as a creep’.<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods and smiles, “something tells me, that it is the right thing to do, giving Riley a chance, I mean,” she says then turns her attention back to the phones on display, “I like this one,” she then says, pointing to a phone that has a slim and girly design, the exterior color even is in an almost sparkling pink.<br />
<br />
“Good choice, Jeff,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
“Please, Sarah,” the “girl” says, “when I’m in this form, can you not call me “Jeff”? I’d really prefer being called “Amy”, at least while I’m her!”<br />
<br />
“Right, sorry,” Sarah says, “you seem to enjoy being Amy.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” smiles and nods, “I really love being a girl,” she says, “it’s so much better than being a boy!”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “let’s just hope the real Amy doesn’t get wind about this,” she whispers, which Riley is unable to hear.<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “would be hard to explain why she suddenly has a “twin” or “clone”,” the little “girl” whispers back.<br />
<br />
“I suggest, you only transform into “Amy” when only you and me are by ourselves,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
“AND when I’m with my Riley,” “Amy” adds with a smile.<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles back, “of course,” she says, she then raises her voice, “right, let’s grab your new phone and go pay for it. Would you like to head someplace different after we paid?”<br />
<br />
“Actually, I could use a little brake,” “Amy” says, “let’s go to a cafetaria and get us something small to eat.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Sarah says, she then grabs a box from the shelve, which contains the phone Jeff/”Amy” had chosen, then both head towards the exit to pay.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles to himself as he follows the two, ‘I think I’ll approach them when they have found a place to take their brake,’ he thinks to himself.</p>
