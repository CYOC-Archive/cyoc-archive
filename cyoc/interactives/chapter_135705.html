<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked through the options he could turn into. He kept scrolling through the list until he settled on footwear. He looked through the shoe type list. He could become slippers, converse, sneakers, boots but Jeff settled on the flip flop option. <br />
<br />
Jeff chose the options of the change <br />
Awareness yes <br />
Age random <br />
Gender random <br />
Can wear out yes <br />
Duration 1 year <br />
<br />
Jeff clicked confirm and just sat in his chair waiting. Suddenly Jeff felt a shock he started becoming smaller and his nose became larger. His arms then fused with the top of his nose. Jeff&#39;s face flattened and the rest of his body disappeared so his head was lying there completely flat with his nose sticking up and his arms fused to the nose. <br />
<br />
Jeff waited and then suddenly he could feel himself up right in a dark room. He waited for what seemed like ages when suddenly the door opened and the light came on. Jeff looked around and could see he was placed in a vertical show organiser in a garage of a house. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked toward the door as a tanned boy with blonde hair walked in. He looked around 10 and walked over towards Jeff. He looked down below Jeff and picked up some roller skates. <br />
<br />
The boy then sat on the floor to out them on and suddenly got up and walked out the garage leaving the roller skates and the door open. <br />
<br />
A couple of minutes later a women walked in with the boy to see what the issue is and  asked the boy explained the skates were too small to fit his feet. <br />
<br />
They put the skates back and walk out of the garage leaving Jeff in darkness again. What felt like hours later the women walked back in and over to Jeff. She picked Jeff and the other flip flop up by his arm and walked over to the front room where the boy was sat down watching TV on a beanbag. The mother told the son that they are going shopping and that she had got him new flip flops to wear. The mother dropped Jeff onto the floor in front of the boy sitting down who had one socked foot resting on his knee dangling over Jeff&#39;s face on the heel of the flip flop. <br />
<br />
The boy pulled the socks off his feet and dropped them in front of him with one landing on Jeff&#39;s arm before falling to the floor next to him. The boy continued wiggling and scrunching his bare toes giving Jeff a good view of the feet he would now protect from the ground. Jeff looked up and the smooth tanned soles with the little toes of the boy as he paid Jeff no attention. <br />
<br />
Jeff heard the boy&#39;s mother call telling Jeff to come to the door as they are leaving. Jeff looked up as the boy dropped his foot from his knee into Jeff&#39;s face and could feel as the big dragged his feet up Jeff&#39;s body until the boy placed his heel directly on Jeff&#39;s open moith  and tounge with his toes resting on Jeff&#39;s eyes. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt the boy get up from the chair and start walking toward the door with each step slapping Jeff&#39;s tounge into his heel. <br />
<br />
The boy wore Jeff during the shopping trip when he was waiting by the trolly for his mother he would run his sole of his foot up and down Jeff&#39;s tounge. <br />
<br />
Since it was such a nice day the mother decided that they would drop the shopping off and head to the beach. <br />
<br />
When they arrived at the beach the boy jumped out of the car landing hard on Jeff and started walking toward he entrence. As the boy steps on the sand he kicks Jeff off and picks him up. It&#39;s the first time the boy has actually looked at Jeff and he asks his mother why his living flip flop is older than normal. Jeff was confused until he looked at the other flip flop in the boys hand and could see that one was a girl around the boys age. Jeff looks down at another group of kids walking along the sand still wearing their flip flops and can see they are also living flip flops.<br />
<br />
Jeff realises the system has changed the reality to make all flip flops and maybe all shoes living. <br />
<br />
The boy continues talking to his mother who asks are his new flip flops comfy which the boy confirms. He gets to a spot where he drops his flip flops down next to his mother&#39;s who look really worn with her foot imprinted on their faces. <br />
<br />
The boy spends a couple of hours playing in the sand and swimming in the sea before he walks over to Jeff and the other flip flop and slips his wet sandy feet into them and starts walking toward the car. Jeff looks up to see the really sandy damp feet coming down onto his face and hoped the boy would have some mercy but the feet keep coming Jeff feels the grainy damp mess land on his tongue and he can taste the salty grainy sand as he starts cleaning the sand off his sole we he walked. <br />
<br />
The boy get to the car where he takes both Jeff and the girl off and rubs his sold over their tongues to clean the remaining sand off. The big then picks the girl off the floor and shakes her about to get the sand off her before turning to his mother launching pointing at the flip flop saying it&#39;s funny this one if crying at least it&#39;s water to clean my feet with and rubs her over his heel a little more before slipping her nose between his toes and stamping her onto the floor. <br />
<br />
The mother makes a comment about how they lived before living shoes. The boy picks Jeff up and knocks the sand off his face before running him over his soles and putting him back on. <br />
<br />
The boy said he needed to go to the toilet before he left so he walked over to the toilet block and into one of the cubicals where Jeff was shocked when we saw a girl about 14 built into the wall with her mouth forced open and another slave this time a bit about 8 mounted into the wall where the toilet paper holder would normally be. The boy walked over to the girl pulled his shorts down and say down on her open mouth. Jeff heard a slight wimper as the boy sat down and started clenching his toes as he grunted and a large fart came out directly into the toilet girl followed by the boy shitting into the toilet slave. A couple of minutes later the boy had finished and peed into the girl before standing up and pushing a button behind her which forced the jaw closed and forced her to swallow everything in her mouth and throat before opening her mouth again. The boy then walked over to the toilet paper slave on the wall and grabbed his head by the handle attached to the back of his skull and used his long tongue that is forced out to clean his bum after he had used the slave and once the boy was happy he was cleaned he let go of the boy which retracted the boy back into the wall and forced it&#39;s mouth closer well it was cleaned before the next user. <br />
<br />
The boy walked over of the bathroom and over to the car for the trip home. When they walked through the door the boy ran upstairs to his room still wearing Jeff and sat down at the end of his bed where he kicked Jeff off and for change into PJ&#39;s. He then walked over to the side of his bed and placed his feet in the slipper slaves mouth and walked out the room downstairs. <br />
<br />
Jeff spent the next year bring worn by the boy and watching as the boy used slaves and items everywhere as if they were objects including as chairs at school and also as kids bikes.</p>
