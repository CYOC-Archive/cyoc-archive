<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Well it looks like you're enjoying this," the merman said stopping briefly. I was ashamed to admit that my body was enjoying it as my 
moans attested to. I still didn't want this but I had resigned myself to it. There wasn't anything I could do about it anyway. All I could hope 
for was for it to end soon. Though there was a part of me that didn't want it to end. There was a loud crash on the other side of the door 
and he asked, "What was that?"</p>
<p>For an answer the door was rent from it's frame leaving it a twisted wreck. Behind the door were two mermen holding spears that had 
glowing spearheads. Instead of being naked though they had on loincloths. The one on the left had red scales and the other had green 
scales. "Draclith you will come with us and stand judgement before the king."</p>
<p>"I've been banished Frofall so I can't go before the king," Draclith said annoyance in his voice. "Besides I haven't broken any mer 
laws."</p>
<p>"You've kidnapped the princess which is against mer law as well as many others," Frofall said a little edge to his voice.</p>
<p>"Kidnapped!" Draclith said sounding very surprised. "I didn't kidnap her. I paid for her services and she's been enjoying it. You know 
me Henditch and know I wouldn't kidnap anyone."</p>
<p>"I thought I knew you but then you tried to take the throne," Henditch said sounding sad. "Now I have no idea what you're capable of."
</p>
<p>"I tried taking the throne because I would have been able to do a better job," Draclith said resentment in his voice. "Making a pact with 
spooks wasn't a good idea."</p>
<p>"We are authorized to kill anyone who we perceive as hindering our rescue of the princess," Frofall said a very dangerous edge to his 
voice.</p>
<p>"That would be a death sentence for me since I would go back to a highly radioactive area," Draclith said fear in his voice and I could 
feel him shaking.</p>
<p>"Then you had better do what we tell you," Frofall said his voice colder than ice. "Withdraw from the princess and unshackle her. Then 
place your hands behind your head."</p>
<p>Draclith hurried to obey and I was sorry to feel him pull out. I wasn't sorry when he released me from my bonds though. I tried standing 
but I had been in one position so long and had so many orgasms that I couldn't. Henditch came over and scooped me up while Frofall tied 
Draclith's hands behind his back. "What happens now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Now we take you to your parents through the water way," Henditch said with a slight smile at me.</p>
<p>I had wanted to ask what the water way was but I was sure I would find out in a few moments. Sure enough after taking a couple 
corridors we came to a puddle. Frofall stepped in it with Draclith and they both sunk down into it. Henditch stepped in it and started sinking 
as well. When my ass and feet touched the water I thought he was going to continue sinking and leave me sitting in this puddle. However I 
didn't feel the floor when I was supposed to if that were the case. Instead I continued to feel the water slide up my body and a warm 
feeling in my legs. I was scared when the water reached my face and took a big gulp of air before the water covered my mouth and nose 
forgetting that I was a mermaid now. As I fully slid under the water I saw a large area with many glowing spots above one of which we we 
emerging from. Looking around I saw many mer entering and exiting these glowing spots. There were swirls of color floating about making 
interesting patterns everywhere. The sight of all this made me forget to hold my breath and I let out a soft, "Wow!" I couldn't have imagined 
how beautiful it was from any description given to me. One truly had to see it for themselves in order to appreciate how beautiful it was. 
Henditch swam a little way through this place ignoring greetings from some mers he passed. It was during this little swim that I noticed my 
legs had transformed into a fish tail. It happened because I had to pee and couldn't hold it. When I did I felt it leave my body lower down 
than what it should have. Something also told me that there was only one hole down there where everything came out. We came to a 
glowing spot that had a couple of mer guarding it. They nodded to Henditch and he swam through.</p>
<p>We emerged from what looked like a pool of water in a room full of water. I could see where the water in the room ended and the 
water in the pool began. I couldn't tell how I could see it though. "At last we have our daughter!" a voice boomed out. "Why are you 
carrying her though Henditch?"</p>
<p>"She could not stand when we found her Your Majesty," Henditch said with a slight bow.</p>
<p>"Draclith had her bound and was having sex with her," Frofall said also with a slight bow.</p>
<p>I looked at the merman who was obviously the king. He had the same color of hair that I did now and his tail was also a gold color. He 
looked shocked at what he was told and looking at me asked, "Did you want to have sex with him?"</p>
<p>I felt the heat rise in my cheeks and said, "I didn't when he first started to rape me but I started to enjoy it after a bit."</p>
<p>"She's lying!" Draclith protested. "There's no way I could have had sex with a mermaid against her will."</p>
<p>"In ordinary circumstances that would be true," the king said in a thoughtful way. "However this is not an ordinary circumstance. You 
know that mermaids have to be taught how to tighten those muscles to prevent forced entry. Princess Heldia wasn't taught that though 
since she's new and she never appeared where we had requested her to appear."</p>
<p>"I didn't kidnap her and I didn't mean to rape her," Draclith said remorse evident in his voice. "I was told that she had decided to offer 
sex for money and that she was willing to be bound in one position for hours at a time." He turned to me and said, "I'm sorry I caused you 
harm."</p>
<p>"I believe what you say," the king said with a heavy sigh. "However we need to know if you impregnated her. I don't think there's any 
law or loophole for this situation. I'll have to consult the law keeper about it. For now though I need Witch to find out if Heldia is indeed 
pregnant."</p>
<p>A few moments later a mermaid swam in. She had green hair and her tail was black with individual white scales. "What can I do for 
you Your Majesty?" she asked with a bow.</p>
<p>"I need you to tell me if Princess Heldia is pregnant or not Witch," the king said with a frown.</p>
<p>Witch nodded and swam over to me and Henditch. Placing her hand on my belly she closed her eyes and began murmuring words 
that I couldn't understand. After a few moments she opened her eyes and looking at the king said, "It's too early to tell with any certainty. I 
do detect two possible lives. That's because the eggs were just fertilized in the last few hours. I'll be able to tell you if she is pregnant with 
a higher degree of certainty in ten days."</p>
<p>The king sighed and said, "Very well then. You are dismissed Witch." As soon as Witch was gone the king turned to Draclith and said, 
"This does present a problem even if Witch isn't sure that Princess Heldia will be pregnant. For the moment your fates are intertwined so I 
can't just send you back to wherever you were. So for the next ten days at least I am suspending your banishment. However you will have 
three guards with you at all times. You will also stay away from my daughter unless she wishes otherwise."</p>
<p>All eyes turned toward me seeking my decision. I just knew that Draclith had been telling the truth and he didn't know he was raping 
me. However just because someone doesn't know doesn't make it alright does it? I did feel something for him but was that my heartfelt 
feelings or just my body wanting to finish what had been started? Would my decision have an impact on what would happen if I was 
pregnant?</p></p>
