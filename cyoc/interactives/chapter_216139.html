<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Note: The first part of this is just a little snippet adjusted from the last paragraph of chapter 11. The rest will focus on Susan’s changes.)<br />
<br />
“Please, Mr. Milhaud,” Ty requested, “can I please use the bathroom? I’ll be back in a few minutes.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, Ty,” Mr. Milhaud answered. Just like that, Ty rises out of his seat and gets out of the classroom. <br />
<br />
Once he gets in the bathroom, he takes his shirt off to see if he got as much body hair as hoped. To his disappointment, he didn’t see much body hair on his chest. When he got out of the bathroom after he put his shirt back on, however, he noticed that something about Susan was a bit… off. Susan has gotten a little bit of facial hair on the top of her lip. Not only that, but because of the fact that she wore a shirt that didn’t cover her belly, she also received a line of body hair between her belly button and pubic hair.<br />
<br />
‘Please let this be a dream,’ Ty thought, realizing that he accidentally went too far. Unfortunately, the changes didn’t show any signs of stopping until they were complete.<br />
<br />
(Okay, now this is where the changes really begin, so I hope you’re ready!)<br />
<br />
Susan, meanwhile, is in a state of panic after discovering some facial hair on her lip. She was fairly attractive, but this was going to single-handedly ruin her beauty. How is she going to explain this to everyone? It didn’t help that her hips were feeling funny too. Susan arrived in the classroom and returned to her seat. Ty watches her closely as Susan keeps squirming in her seat. It didn’t take her long to realize that her hips were much more narrow than before.<br />
<br />
‘Oh no,’ Susan thought, ‘this has got to be some kind of a nightmare.’ However, it all sounded too real to just be one of them. Ty and the other students watched as Susan continued to transform, though none of them said anything. If anything, he, along with the other students, reacted with shock as the rest of Susan’s face rearranged itself.<br />
<br />
Susan’s jaw sharpens and becomes angular, making it more rough and hard than smooth. Her cheekbones slightly rise as they protrude out along with both her chin and forehead. Her eyes shrink a little as they become ovular. Her eyelashes shrink down while her eyebrows thicken. Her hair, meanwhile, recedes back to her scalp to become an undercut. Her lips become thin as the rest of her facial hair grows into a combination of a goatee and a mustache.<br />
<br />
“Somebody-” Susan’s very loud sentence interrupted itself as she began to develop a little bump on her neck. “Help-” her voice was neither a soprano nor a tenor, but that leaned more with the latter when the bump on her neck turned into an Adam’s apple before letting her finish with a, “me!”<br />
<br />
Not long after that, everyone watches as Susan’s breasts slowly start to recede into her chest. At that point, Susan questioned why she wore a shirt that didn’t cover her belly. She looks at her boobs reluctantly as they are nothing more than A cups at that point, and within the next minute, they were completely gone. Her nipples joined along in the change by shrinking and getting darker. Susan tries to rub both of them before they’re turned, but it’s already too late for her. Both of her nipples are no longer a sign of pleasure for Susan.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god…” one of the students commented in fear as Susan looked at both of her hands. They’re getting bigger for her while her fingers simultaneously become rough and boorish. Muscle spreads all across Susan’s body as both her arms and legs thicken until they become undeniably manly. The changes go back to Susan’s chest. Chest hair sprouts out of Susan, and to replace her B cup tits, her chest itself fills up with muscle until Susan has an amazing set of broad pecs. This forces her to take off both her shirt and bra. The muscle eventually spreads down to her waist as it also thickens while she receives a six-pack stomach, completely destroying her hourglass figure in the process. The fat within her butt and thighs, meanwhile, redistribute themselves by letting its fat turn into muscle while shrinking and becoming tighter and flatter.<br />
<br />
It’s the point when all of the girls’ expressions become a mix of shock and lust. In response to the growing muscle, Susan’s spine grows until she has a height of 6’5”. Both her shoulders and skin also accommodate Susan’s new form, with the former broadening up and the latter tanning a bit like she spent years at the gym. Susan looks down to her feet. They are big and meaty like both of her hands. She looks a little closer at all of her nails and notices that they became unpolished. Back with the golden body hair, it grows on Susan’s legs and arms until it becomes completely noticeable when naked. <br />
<br />
“At least I’m still technically a girl,” Susan mutters, pointing out the only thing unchanged. It turns out to be an unnecessary comment as she starts to feel an intense warmth inside her pants.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Susan yelled, “why did I say that out loud?” Susan fearfully takes off her pants and strips down her panties, making her entirely nude. She watches as the magic gets inside her. Her clitoris gradually lengthens while letting the magic masculize the rest of her female organs. Both her fallopian tubes and uterus dissolve as her womb shrinks down and becomes her new prostate gland. Her vagina and cervix seal shut to make some room for a new change. Susan watches her labia get saggy while her reproductive system begins to produce sperm instead of eggs. During that process, her ovaries migrate downward with her growing clit to become a juicy pair of testicles. Once both her clit and scrotum finished growing, foreskin covers up the former before letting a new head pop out at the end, completing his clit’s transformation into a six inch long penis. <br />
<br />
“Who did this to me?” Susan asks as he stands up while his face is seething in anger. Everyone’s expressions jumble around with some of them trying to hit on him, mainly the girls, while others react with either shock or amusement.<br />
<br />
‘Crap,’ Ty thought, ‘what do I do? Susan’s pissed off like crazy! Maybe wishing he was always like that would work.’ To let it out, Ty whispered to himself, “I wish Susan was always a man named Sean, and new clothes would show up on him afterward.”<br />
<br />
As Ty whispers that, Susan gets a big headache to let the magic get ready to change one last part. Instead of being born as a girl, he recalled being born as a boy. He remembered being at the gym much more often than he&#39;d ever been as a girl. Susan became sexually attracted to women as he also remembers being on the football team. While the latter memory occurred, he became well known as one of the strongest members of the team. He raises his head up as everyone’s memory of Susan erased itself to make way for memories of Sean. <br />
<br />
A minute after everyone digested that, Sean watches as new clothes appear on him. A black t-shirt shows up while her panties turn into a pair of briefs that fit his new crotch. A pair of men’s jeans hides his legs, and Sean’s feet receive Vans shoes. Meanwhile, all of Sean’s old clothes vanished as if they were never there to begin with. With the transformation completely done, Sean goes back to his seat, and he, along with everyone else, acts like nothing happened.</p>
