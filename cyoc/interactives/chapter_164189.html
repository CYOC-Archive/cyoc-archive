<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris’s heart rate was as fast as he ever knew it to be, he knew this was because of the drug in his system which would turn him into a centaur and his own nervous. He closed his eyes and tried to calm his heart, when he opened them, he looked at himself. The transformation chamber had a large mirror which allowed him or anyone else to see the change with ease. He was in the nude in a harness his feet flat on the ground. For a long moment nothing happened and then he felt a tug on his gut.<br />
He was never proud of his gut, his beer belly or his dad body whichever one picked to call it. In one second, it was gone as all the fat he had built up moved down all at once, leaving only the muscle he had under the layer of fat behind. Instantly the straps where loss but the ones under his arms held him tight. <br />
He watched in a strange mixture of horror and amazement as out of that fat two more limbs began to grow. It was two blacken hooves followed by flesh color horse legs, they lacked any fur which only made it stranger. While two new limbs where growing out of his body, his back legs where moving backwards as his spin elongated as some of his organs moved down into his body. He didn’t know but as some of his organs where moving down into his soon to be horse half, his heart was growing in size as well as his lungs. He watched as his body grew out and out until it was clearly a centaur, his skin had yet developed any fur. So he was a centaur but with totally human skin which was horrifying. <br />
“You are about halfway done; fur normally comes in last.” Said one of the doctors as Chris nodded his head. He felt something brush the back of his neck, he reached up and touched the back of his neck, his short buzz cut had grown out a bit, a strip of hair was coming out of the back of his head and growing down to the small of his back. <br />
“That is normal, a horse has a main remember.” Said a centaur nurse as she turned a bit and raised her own long hair to show a line of hair running to the small of her back. <br />
“Alright.” said Chris, his voice parched and higher then normal, as he felt a pain in his rear as he turned and saw a black tuff of fur growing out of his tail bone area. He was getting his tail; it was strange his hair was brown not black. That didn’t last long as his hair began to shift to a jet black color.<br />
“Doctor.” Said a nurse as the werewolf doctor moved around and looked at Chris’s tail. He was back there for a few moments, before coming back to face Chris.<br />
“Well…everything is going good.” Said the Doctor “However we now know what type of Centaur you are becoming…”<br />
“What does that mean?” inquired Chris as his voice sounded weird, he reached up to his neck only to realize that he didn’t have an adam’s apple anymore. His eyes widened as his mind began to process what that meant but it was too late. He felt some of his remaining fat on his stomach move up to his chest as his breast expanded outward at a slow but steady rate.<br />
“You are becoming a female centaur.” Stated the Doctor<br />
“YOU SAID I WAS BECOMING A CENTAUR…NOT A WOMAN CENTAUR!!!” yelled Chris at the top of his now larger lungs, his voice was now much higher and clearly female. <br />
“Yes, a female centaur is still a centaur.” Said the doctor, the doctor was used to dealing with anger by those who are transforming into something they hate or like in this case an unexpected gender change. “I am sorry but we have ways to help you adjust to the change.”<br />
“Adjust!” yelled Chris as he felt something brush his shoulders, he looked in the mirror to see his face was now clearly female, in truth it was a rather pretty face with large dark eyes and now dark raven black hair which was now touching his now narrow shoulders. He could not see how big his breasts had grown but they where now pressing against the straps of the harness and if he guessed had to be at least C cups. <br />
“You are about done.” Said the nurse as Chris looked to see that his or was it her body now was growing a deep brownish red fur over his/her horse body. Chris just stood there transfixed as the nurses released the restraints and he/she stood without aid on new hoven feet. It lasted only a moment before she laid down and began to cry as she covered her new breasts with her hands. <br />
“GOD WHY?” cried Chris<br />
“Don’t worry, everything will be alright.” Said a nurse “Come on lets get you dressed and somewhere safe.”</p>
