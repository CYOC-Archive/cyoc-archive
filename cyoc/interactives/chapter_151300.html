<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;m not sure how I feel about &quot;owning&quot;. On the one hand, it turns me on and is one of the biggest reasons I&#39;m into inanimate tf. On the other hand, if the owner becomes excessively abusive, it turns me off.  I&#39;m more of a sensualists, not a sadist.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had set an alarm on their phone to wake them in the morning before too much of the day had passed. The sun was just peaking over the mountains beautifully. Naturally the guys thought of breakfast so decided to head back to dry ground and build a campfire.<br />
<br />
Del turned the key to start Greg but his engine spluttered and wouldn&#39;t start.<br />
<br />
Cliff asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Sounds like water got into the gas tank. Check the gas cap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony hopped out and checked the gas cap. &quot;It&#39;s loose. Someone forgot to tighten it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cliff asked, &quot;What are we going to do? We can&#39;t fix that way out here in the middle of nowhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Yes we could but it would take a lot of time and we would need to move the Jeep to dry ground first. How about we make him human and he can swim to shore.&quot;<br />
<br />
They hopped out and Del pressed the button on the fob. Greg became human but he was turning blue from not breathing. He started floating away down river like a dead body. The boys panicked and grabbed him, taking him to shore.<br />
<br />
Cliff yelled, &quot;He&#39;s drowning. Does anyone know C.P.R.?&quot; All of them shook their heads. &quot;We have to try something.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Cliff attempted to give mouth to mouth. He repeated a phrase he heard on t.v. &quot;Out with the bad air, in with the good air.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Greg&#39;s own body kicked in vomiting out the excessive water. He started breathing and his skin turned back to it&#39;s reddish tan complexion. He was still drowsy and fell asleep again but he was breathing.<br />
<br />
After the boys celebrated and calmed down, Del noticed Greg&#39;s crotch. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; He pointed at the bare crotch of their friend Greg who lay sleeping at their feet. &quot;Is that a pussy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys laughed but Greg&#39;s pussy fanned Del&#39;s flames of desire even more. He really wanted to own Greg now and use that pussy.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff was in the garage where Jenkins was caressing him again. Jeff felt very pampered because Jenkins spent a lot of his free time caring for Jeff. Jeff spent a lot of his time as a Jeep but when he was a Jeep, Jenkins was always polishing him, cleaning him, making sure he got the best gasoline and other fluids, and making sure Jeep was always as &quot;healthy&quot; as Jeep could be.<br />
<br />
Jenkins didn&#39;t keep Jeff a Jeep all the time. Jeff didn&#39;t have to sit in the boring garage waiting for something to happen. Jeff still went to school. He had missed a few days when he first moved in with Jenkins because they had to figure out a new schedule. It was also awkward seeing Greg and the guys at school because they kept wanting Jeff to go to shop class and be Greg&#39;s project but Jeff said, &quot;Greg doesn&#39;t own me anymore.&quot; And when they called Jenkins to ask for permission to use Jeff, Jenkins said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t trust any of you. You&#39;ll probably make a mess of my Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Jeff wasn&#39;t in school, he and Jenkins watched t.v., played games, went out or made love.<br />
<br />
After Jenkins finished polishing Jeff, he pressed the button on the fob making Jeff human. &quot;I&#39;ve got some housework to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t have anything to do but he followed Jenkins and by his own choice, decided to help Jenkins with the housework.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Why are you so nice to me? I&#39;m just an object.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins kissed him, &quot;You are not just an object. Maybe it&#39;s my Native American heritage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;You&#39;re Native American?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins said, &quot;Well obviously not full blood Native American. My dad married a Native American and one of my dad&#39;s ancestors married a Native American so I am about fifty-six percent Native American. So I blended the best of the native and white heritage together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I heard that Native Americans have no concept of ownership.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins said, &quot;That is not an accurate statement. Our concept of ownership is different from the white man&#39;s concept. The white man came in with the notion that if they owned everything, they could use it all up, trash it, and abuse it because that is the white man&#39;s concept of ownership. The native concept is that everything is lent to us by the great spirits and therefore we should be grateful for everything. We are taught to cherish our possessions and to cherish the Earth itself. We are taught that to own something is to also be responsible for the care of whatever we own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed with emotion, Jeff kissed Jenkins. Jenkins put his hand in Jeff&#39;s hair. &quot;Yes, I am very grateful to have you.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Greg finally woke up. He sat up where the guys left him on the river bank. He saw that they had billed a campfire and they were cooking the fish they caught.  Each of them sat around the campfire with his legs spread and his genitals swinging free. Greg realized that his pussy was on full display and had been for some time.<br />
<br />
How long had they left him exposed like that? How much of his five hours of human time had been wasted on being left unconscious on a river bank while his friends had breakfast?<br />
<br />
The guys were talking about Greg&#39;s shifter. <br />
<br />
Cliff said, &quot;I guess we need to be more careful about what parts we replace. Maybe parts come in male or female. When we get back to school, we&#39;ll have to find all male parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;We could go to town today and see about getting a male shifter for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Del said, &quot;That would take hours and there&#39;s no guarantee we&#39;d be able to find a shifter. I don&#39;t want to waste an entire day just to end up with nothing. He does have a shifter already. Why does he need a male shifter?&quot;</p>
