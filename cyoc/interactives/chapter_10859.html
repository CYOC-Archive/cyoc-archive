<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Catherine had been visiting a little magic shop in town, which was nestled behind a cheap hairdressers and a few alternative clothing shops, when she had found the medallion lying outside it. So far from the main shopping areas and centre of the town, nobody had spotted it. Catherine, being an aspiring Witch, had known it was magical.<br />
<br />
When she got home to the house she shared with her friend Tina and her not-so-much-a-friend Neil, Catherine pored through her occult books. Sure enough, a picture and description of the amulet was readily available to her inquiring mind. She was stunned and pleased to have found such a wonderful and valuable item. It wasn’t like her usual luck at all. <br />
<br />
Catherine spent a good deal of her time working as a waitress in a small caf&eacute;. She was not an incredibly beautiful girl, but she was attractive. She was a slight 5’4’’, with brown eyes and hair. She had pretty features and quite a good figure. Her legs were not long and slender, but were nicely curved and she was proud of her lack of extra weight. She was a normal weight for her size, not like a model. Her breasts were an average 32B…she would have liked them larger. All in all, she was a nice looking girl without being anything fantastic. She was also an average student and earned an average wage. No wonder she wanted to be a Witch!<br />
<br />
Catherine had left her medallion wrapped up safely in a box under her bed. She intended to use it, but not yet. She needed more experience as a Witch, so if something went wrong she could at least try to fix it. She was making a cup of tea in their kitchen when Neil returned.<br />
<br />
Tina was fine to live with in their small house, but Neil was a nightmare. Tina was a student nurse and actually spent her time studying and working, but Neil was living off his grant money and spending most of it on alcohol. He thought living with two girls was great. He made no attempt to hide the fact he thought Tina was sexy and Catherine could not count the number of times he had slipped a look into Tina’s room or through the keyhole as she showered. In contrast, he thought Catherine was fine to look at and often said she wouldn’t “be a bad ride”. He also thought she was his personal slave.<br />
<br />
Little did Tina know, that one week when she had been away, Neil had flipped on Catherine and beat her. He had come in one night drunk and laid into her for complaining about it. He was not a massive guy, but was fit and healthy. He was a good bit heavier than her and was about six foot tall. So when he had hit her, it had really hurt. He had said sorry, of course. It hadn’t happened again, not on that scale. Catherine could not forget about it and she really hated him. He was an arrogant bully…but what could she do?<br />
<br />
‘Yo, Catherine! Get me a beer will you, babe?’<br />
<br />
Catherine fumed. Who did he think he was? She rushed out of the kitchen and stood with her arms folded, frowning.<br />
<br />
‘Get your own beer, you loser!’ She almost gasped at her own words.<br />
Neil looked at her, standing there in her jeans and a sweater. Her sleeves were rolled up and she looked very threatening…for a 5’4’’ woman. He stood up himself, walking over to her. He also wore jeans, but had a green rugby shirt on. He rolled his own sleeves up and stood looking down at her.<br />
<br />
‘When I tell you to do something, bitch. You do it!’ He slapped her across the face and she fell from the force of it.<br />
<br />
Catherine scrambled up in time to see Neil leaving. She could hear him laughing as he walked off down the street.<br />
<br />
The next day, Catherine was applying her makeup to hide the red mark on her right cheek. It was still quite painful to touch, but far less severe than what Neil had done to her before. Tina was still out so there was no support from her. Catherine had already decided on a plan, though. She got the medallion form the box under her bed and took it with her, wrapped up in special piece of cloth that would protect her from the magic of the medallion itself.<br />
<br />
Catherine threw on the clothes she had been wearing yesterday and walked across the road. She knocked on the door and a woman answered. She was smoking and blew it in Catherine’s face.<br />
<br />
‘What do you want, love?’<br />
<br />
‘I was wondering if Tony was in?’<br />
<br />
‘He’s a bit young for you, isn’t he? Well…whatever. TONY! GET DOWN HERE! SOME GIRL IS LOOKING FOR YOU!’ She turned and walked inside. Moments later, a skinny fifteen year old came down the stairs. It was Tony, who was known as a victim by all the kids in the neighbourhood. He was fifteen but did not look it. Whether his mother’s smoking had stunted his growth was uncertain, but he was only five foot tall and built like a stick insect. Not a trace of muscle. He wore a pair of extremely baggy jeans and an equally baggy t-shirt. It hung on his skinny frame.<br />
<br />
‘Hey, Tony. Would you mind doing me a favour? There is a reward in it.’<br />
<br />
When Neil got back, the house was in darkness. That stupid bitch Catherine had probably went out to escape him. When he entered the house, he walking straight to the living room. There she was! Standing right where she had been the previous day. It was like a freaky rerun of events. She wore the same thing, so did he; he had crashed at a friend’s house and only got back now. She even had the same expression and her sleeves were rolled up again.<br />
<br />
Neil chuckled and rolled his own sleeves up.<br />
<br />
‘Must we go through this again, you silly little girl?’ Then he caught something, some movement in her right hand. ‘What you got there?’<br />
<br />
‘None of your business!’<br />
<br />
Neil smirked and walked over to her. He easily pulled her arms away from being crossed and then grasped her right wrist. She gasped and grimaced as he squeezed and then he pulled the cloth from her hand. There was something in it.<br />
<br />
He stepped back and left her rubbing her red wrist. Opening the cloth, he saw a piece of funky jewellery. It was probably worth a bit. He could sell it and buy beers. Smiling he put it on.<br />
<br />
‘Well, what a nice present Catherine! Now go get me a beer little girl and I will not slap you around again. K?’<br />
<br />
As he said it, he felt different. Something shimmered before his eyes and he suddenly found himself lying on the ground. He looked around and saw a shocked Catherine looking down at him. She stood with her mouth open for a good minute, until her shook suddenly changed. She got a smug expression on her face and walked towards him.<br />
<br />
Still confused, Neil shook his head to clear it and then realized Catherine was trying to take the medallion he had stolen back. He reached out to stop her arm as she leaned in to take it. He became even more confused. His arm came into view but he couldn’t see it properly. It was hidden underneath the loose hanging green sleeve of his rugby shirt. Catherine pushed the green-sleeved limb out of the way and lifted the medallion over Neil’s head as he lay befuddled. What was going on?<br />
<br />
He watched her slip the medallion back into her pocket carefully. All the while, it was surrounded by the cloth he had left her holding. Gathering his wits about him, Neil stood up. His once waist-hugging jeans slipped down, as did his once tight boxers. Catherine erupted in laughter.<br />
<br />
He looked down to see what she was laughing at for himself. He had felt his jeans and boxers falling off but hadn’t gathered why. Looking down he was horrified! His athletic legs were gone, replaced by skinny ones with knobbly knees. His proud member and large ball sac were nowhere to be seen. A little sac hung from between his legs, with a thin little cock a few inches long. <br />
<br />
‘Oh, this is far better than I ever imagined! Look at you! Christ, you’ve got the smallest cock I’ve ever seen, Neil! I knew this would teach you a lesson!’<br />
<br />
Neil looked down at his feet, where the jeans and boxers lay. He lifted his puny legs out of them and his socks fell off. Catherine laughed louder and pointed. No wonder his arm had been hidden by the fabric of his rugby shirt. His arms were now too weedy to really roll his sleeves up properly. His rugby shirt hung off him now, way too big. It came down to his knees too. What?!<br />
<br />
Neil looked at Catherine and understood. She really did have magic! She had shrunk him and stolen his muscles!<br />
<br />
‘You bitch!’ He launched himself at her and she put out a hand to stop him. She stopped his charge easily and he struggled to release her one handed grip on his bony shoulder. Her arm was now thicker than his and she was four inches taller, even at her height!<br />
<br />
‘Don’t bother, small fry. You are the new Tony; he has your body, you got his. Better get used to it, too. This is only the beginning.’<br />
<br />
Catherine swung a fist at his face and knocked him out with one punch. She stood over him and laughed for a while. Then she stripped his rugby shirt off, leaving him entirely naked. Once, he would have looked quite impressive in the nude, but not any more. Her biceps were bigger than his by a good bit and she was of a passable height for a woman. He was puny and a short ass now. Neil would be a skinny little runt the rest of his days. That was a good punishment, but Catherine thought she could do even better.<br />
<br />
When Neil awoke, he found himself tied down to his own bed and naked. His skinny limbs strained against the rope, but his barely bulging muscles did nothing. Catherine winked at him from her place over in the corner. She got out of her seat and came over to him. He was face down and his head was positioned so he could see her when he awoke. His jaw stung terribly.<br />
<br />
‘Awake at last, little man! Good show! Time to introduce you two. Peewee…this is my vibrator.’</p>
