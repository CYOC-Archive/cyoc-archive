<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Third period was free period for Wes and Bryan, and the first chance that day they&#39;d have to talk in private. Wes had tried to get Bryan to explain what was going on in history, but he balked and a sharp word from Mr. Clark sent that effort nowhere. Wes didn&#39;t even need to tell Bryan to meet up with him, they met at the library at one of the back tables. It was normally secluded enough for their antics but not what Wes had in mind today.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got us one of the study rooms.&quot; Wes said, motioning for Bryan to join him. God, he almost didn&#39;t recognize his best friend anymore. Those cornrows seemed to be the final touch on his changes, even the way he spoke and carried himself was different, a little cockier, more sure. More like Ross.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing!&quot; Bryan stood up and put an arm around Wes&#39; shoulder. A couple of girls at a nearby table tittered and gave the pair of them coy looks. Seemed the plan could still go off, but Bryan wasn&#39;t paying the two girls any heed, instead slipping into the private room.<br />
<br />
Wes hesitated for a moment as he saw what looked like Kendall slipping into one of the other study rooms but what was with that outfit? Actually, it looked kind of sexy on him, and Wes had a moment to think what it might look like on him. He dropped that thought and stomped on it, hard. No.<br />
<br />
Wes stepped inside and closed the door, leaving only the smoked glass that let in some ambient light from the library between them and the rest of the school. Bryan already had his shirt off, his firm brown pecs on display, that little bit of black hair in the middle, the dark nipples perking up in the cool library air. Wes bit his lip, just looking at Bryan like this had him hard as a rock in a moment. He was pulled close before he could protest, lips pressed against his, a hand slipping up his shirt. The kiss breaking so he could get the shirt off.<br />
<br />
When Bryan started working at his belt, Wes pushed back, putting a hand on Bryan&#39;s chest. &quot;Pare.&quot; His new accent came out smooth and clean, he cringed. &quot;Stop. Please. Don&#39;t you notice something fucked up is going on here? I mean, why did you and Ross show up to pick me up this morning together?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan looked at Wes, then dropped down into one of the chairs. &quot;Of course I know shit&#39;s fucked up. I just like it. As for Ross, I dunno, somehow we&#39;re brothers now? I woke up in his house. The longer the day goes the more that it seems right.&quot; Wes sat down next to Bryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m scared, hermano.&quot; It was harder to control himself around Bryan. Apart from his best friend he could control the Spanish and the accent, but as soon as Bryan was near it came spilling out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made a second wish.&quot; Bryan finally admitted.<br />
<br />
Wes stared at him. &quot;Are you the one causing all this around the school, with all the guys suddenly getting hot?&quot; Wes pulled up the file on his phone. &quot;First I was trying to keep up with the changes I noticed, then it was all I could do just to put down the names of people I noticed looking or acting different. Things are going crazy, hermano.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s not just me being horny?&quot; Bryan breathed out a sigh of relief, &quot;I thought I was going insane staring at Mr. Clark this morning. But no, that wasn&#39;t me. Not unless I really misworded something.&quot; Bryan took a deep breath and looked up at Wes. &quot;I got jealous seeing you fucking out in the sports shed. I thought I was losing my best friend again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was your plan.&quot; Wes said, looking at Bryan. &quot;Pretend to be a couple and fuck the chicas that get off on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know.&quot; Bryan sighed and leaned back. Wes&#39; eyes wandered to the expanse of muscle that was his friends chest again. He wanted to press his face between those meaty muscles. &quot;So I went back to the park and wished our relationship was more like Ross and Diego&#39;s. Except I think it misunderstood or I was flustered and it made us more like Ross and Diego. I&#39;m sorry man, I didn&#39;t mean to mess with you like that. I&#39;d fucking punch me if I were you. I&#39;d deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes felt anger boiling inside of him, but it was mixed with affection. He probably would have done something similar if he thought he was losing Bryan. Thinking on it, the wish did sort of come true. He did love Bryan. Even if he wanted to mess around and let his libido run wild he knew he would always come right back to him. Even better if he was there for the fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I made a wish. Undid it? We could go back to being ourselves?&quot; Wes offered. Bryan paled. Well, as much as he could pale.<br />
<br />
&quot;If whatever is going on let us. I have a feeling we&#39;d end up caught in that anyway. But I swear, it wasn&#39;t me.&quot; Wes nodded at the tone in Bryan&#39;s voice. He really didn&#39;t cause the weirdness going on. &quot;I think another wish might just make things go really haywire. Whatever&#39;s going on it&#39;s affecting the whole damn school. Vince was hitting on me all through last period. Asked if you and I were and item. I said yes, he asked for a threesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vince was one of the hotter members of the football team. He also flirted with guys but usually jokingly, he did have a girlfriend. Wes gave it some serious thought. &quot;Okay, no new wishes, but you think this one is going to leave us alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan nodded. &quot;It&#39;s making hot guys, we already fit. The jocks are the ones changing the least, physically anyway. I think I caught Chuck pulling Tyler into a bathroom stall. There was definitely a blow job going on in there when I left.&quot; Bryan was about to say more but Wes was kissing him, again. He really couldn&#39;t control himself around his best friend. Wes knelt down on the ground, unbuttoning Bryan&#39;s jeans eagerly.<br />
<br />
Would it really be so bad to just give in to the changes? Wes thought to himself. After all, he still had Bryan, and now he was one of the hottest guys at school.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Kendall sighed as Allison pulled off of him just in time to let his cum harmlessly hit the floor. Already she&#39;d pulled him to orgasm twice and third period wasn&#39;t even half over. He panted slightly and slipped down into a chair, reaching out for Allison&#39;s water bottle so he could take a swig. He sat naked in the chair, unworried. The librarians never checked on the private study rooms unless you made too much noise. They had gotten away with this countless times.<br />
<br />
His dick was going to be sore after much more of this. Thank god his body could keep up now. He messaged one of his pecs. They felt even bigger than they had when he was at the store. He imagined them pressing against the shoulder straps of those overalls he got, or just letting the top hand down to expose his chest and stomach.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know what Allison thought of those, but she probably wouldn&#39;t care what he wore as long as he looked sexy in it. His hand ran down to his stomach and he frowned a little. His fingers traced the line between his abs. It was fainter, he could only really make out four and it just wasn&#39;t as firm as he remembered. Probably just the way he was sitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for chapter three?&quot; Allison chimed in happily. Kendall could only nod wordlessly.</p>
