<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If someone asked the hypothetical &quot;you&quot; to assume what a male cheerleader might be like, the answer would probably not be anything like what Gary Lambert was...and yet, in a different sense, the answer might be &quot;exactly Gary Lambert, but...&quot; Gary was presently in the bus with the cheerleaders and chaperones. And it was precisely the chaperones who gave Gary grief. In no small part because of his unique predicament.<br />
<br />
Seated by the back, trying to make sure he had some space in case he wanted to do something with someone, Gary was a peroxide blond, tanned young man with a very lean, tightly muscled body. Dressed presently in his cheer attire, Gary leaned back against the seat. He didn&#39;t expect quite so many chaperones, hence his visible displeasure. His bright blue eyes darted around, hoping that the adults - and one adult in particular - would leave them be.<br />
<br />
Gary was someone people often assumed, due to his looks, his body structure - including a very generous and tightly muscled ass - and total pretty boy face that surely, surely, Gary was gay. An assumption he faced often, almost daily. One of the most frequent teases he got was asking if his boyfriend was around. The thing was Gary was straight. And aggressively so. Despite the reputation of his sport, or perhaps because of it, he was a smidge oversensitive to any suggestion he was homosexually inclined.<br />
<br />
And as if overcompensating for it, the fact he by all appearances looked like a twink, Gary was known among the cheerleaders as an utterly gifted and enthusiastic lover. Perhaps it was overcompensating, but the varsity cheer squad knew that if they ever needed some companionship, Gary was an eager and continuously enthusiastic partner.<br />
<br />
Presently, Gary was just across from Monique, his partner in an open relationship. Both agreed neither could meaningfully commit, so Gary encouraged her to enjoy herself, whereas Monique helped Gary with his own screwing around - giving him tips on how to please women better.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I assumed we&#39;d be to State by now,&quot; he grumbled as he shifted in his seat. &quot;Except instead, we have this all going on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bored and horny?&quot; Monique asked, looking over at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soooo fucking horny!&quot; Gary tossed his head back in frustration. He looked at the row of chaperones in the car. Fuck, and Graham was still here.<br />
<br />
Graham Parker was the youngest of the chaperones - a former football player himself, Graham was tall, incredibly well built and muscular, his black hair cropped short and in a buzz cut. His features were handsome in a slightly intimidating way. He looked every bit like the standard bully in a movie or tv show - probably named Eugene, Brad, Chad or something. Except Graham was ultimately a very supportive guy - perhaps a bit too supportive. Gary hated being coddled. Supposedly, Graham busted his knee in college, and hence, here he was volunteering as a chaperone.<br />
<br />
Graham was openly bisexual, and for all his look, he tried his hardest to both be a stern and fair chaperone and support his charges. It was just that one of the rules was &quot;no hanky panky&quot; so to speak, and that was precisely what Gary hoped to get away with in the back. Quite a few times on the road when Gary and Monique got handsy, Graham would interrupt with a &quot;this is your reminder - no sexual activity on the bus&quot;. Even when it was just makin&#39; out!<br />
<br />
Gary scowled when Graham went back to check on him. Graham asked, &quot;You doing okay back here, Gary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, captain killjoy,&quot; Gary replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, if you have any sort of uhh...&quot; Graham started...<br />
<br />
And Gary responded immediately, &quot;Still hetero.&quot; Followed by a sigh from Graham.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just see how aggressively you&#39;re asserting your straightness on average, Gary,&quot; Graham started, &quot;And I kind of worry. Because I was the same way, you know? Until I learned to accept who I was.&quot; Gary could not get too mad at empathy, and he did acknowledge that Graham did have his best interests perhaps at heart by thinking as much. But if anything that only made the assumption more frustrating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still hetero.&quot; Gary blithely stated.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, the bus had come to a stop.  Sitting there as the downpour rattled the bus, Gary was no closer to release.  After encounters with both Graham and Mrs. Ann, Gary was worse for wear, his young body needing action and now. Seeing the football team piling off their bus through the window, Gary started to get up.  &quot;well, if they can&#39;t find the exit, maybe we can.&quot; Leave it to the muscle men to get stuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not without a chaperone.&quot; Graham stepped up, not exactly eager to strain his knee too terribly much, but he knew what would probably happen if he let Gary &quot;the walking libido&quot; Lambert and Monique go out into the woods. They were exactly the dumb kind of teens who would fall into the tired horror movie stereotype of teens fooling around in the woods.<br />
<br />
Gary felt like screaming, but he looked around at the remaining cheerleaders after Mrs. Ann lead the first group off of the bus. &quot;Any...other girls wanna follow along?&quot; he inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m down!&quot; Clara DuFresne stepped up. The red head cheerleader was a former girlfriend of Gary&#39;s, and the two had separated under rather contentious terms. She wasn&#39;t however in the mood right now to hold that as a relevant issue. The jocks were gathering around their bus, but Gary didn&#39;t care about that. It looked like there was some sort of cabin up a lit path away from the busses, trees lining the path.<br />
<br />
&quot;Count me in.&quot; Mina Corcoran - a somewhat petite brunette - said. She was getting a rather odd vibe from the place. She was if anything the most superstitious - it comes from her mom being a TV show psychic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Graham stated, &quot;Don&#39;t get lost and don&#39;t run off on your own...that goes especially for you, Gary.&quot; Gary rolled his eyes and stuck near the front of the group as he and Graham took point outside in the rain. Monique stood back behind Gary, while the other two girls stood near the rear of the group. Graham seemed to be handling the uneven and somewhat forested terrain well enough, but as they explored the surroundings, Gary could see Graham&#39;s knee acting up. He was increasingly wincing and trying not to show his pain from his lingering sports injury.<br />
<br />
By the time they explored behind far side of the cabin, Graham was not in the best of shape. He had to take a seat on a tree stump and let out several harsh breaths as he clutched his knee. &quot;Well,&quot; Gary said with a shrug, &quot;Maybe we should just look around some more and let our chaperone recuperate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gary, what&#39;s the phrase? About [sheep]&#39;s clothing...?&quot; Clara sighed, clearly not in favor of it. She seemed to oddly dote on Graham. Gary had never noticed anything about those two before.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s [wolf]... wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing.&quot; Gary responded, &quot;And I&#39;m not one. I&#39;m just saying we probably need to let him recuperate. His knee got damaged bad back in college. I&#39;m not even---&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina interrupted, &quot;I don&#39;t like this place. The chakras in the air are evil. The place seems despoiled by some dark acts in its history---&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara shook her head, &quot;Okay long island medium, so how about you psychic up a way out of here.&quot; She was not feeling good about leaving Graham at all. He was the adult. He knew his way around problems. And...admittedly, despite her points against Gary, she did feel some degree of attraction to Graham. She knew it was inappropriate and she knew she&#39;d get in a lot of trouble for it...but he was a complete hunk. And somehow? Seeing him in peril, vulnerable, strong yet weak at the same time...? It made her feel a way she dared not act upon. Lest she be labeled a hypocrite as well as getting herself and Graham in trouble.<br />
<br />
Monique at this point trusted her boyfriend wasn&#39;t thinking with his dick, and even as she contemplated what to do, she didn&#39;t know that two out of them out here had thus far had their fates sealed by their own words. &quot;Maybe...maybe we could just---&quot; she was feeling indecisive. She didn&#39;t want to go against Graham&#39;s worry for their safety. At the same time, Gary did make a valid point...</p>
