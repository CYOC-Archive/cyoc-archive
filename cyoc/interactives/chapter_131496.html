<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake decided to try on the otter ring. He pulled one of the silver otter rings out of its white stand, and slipped it on the ring finger of his right hand, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m quite an otter&quot;, he thought, he also noticed the ring was a little loose on his finger. Jake grabbed the ring on his finger with his other hand and attempted to pull it off, only to notice that it would not budge. &quot;What the?&quot; he murmured. The ring was way too loose to be stuck, and yet it seemed it had a mind of its own, unwilling to move.<br />
<br />
At that moment what felt like a bolt of electricity shot from the ring through Jake&#39;s entire body, making him gasp in shock. &quot;What the fuck!&quot; Jake yelped, now desperately trying to remove the ring, &quot;Is this a joke?!&quot; he grunted to himself. The remnants of the shock quickly turned to a a pleasant tingle in his hands, and then an itching in his skin. Jake held up his hands in horror as dark hairs began to grow out of the itching skin on the backs of his fingers and hands, &quot;Someone! What&#39;s happening!&quot; he yelled out, to no response. A strong, pleasurable throbbing and pulling sensation began in his hands. Jake grunted trying to relieve the pressure by pushing his hands against the wall; watching in shock as thick, black hair pushed out above his knuckles as his fingers swelled thicker, now fitting the large ring. His fingers began pushing further up the wall as they grew longer and more masculine. The nails on his fingers looked well-manicured now. His palms stretched out longer and wider. He pulled his large, manly hands in front of his face; they were impressive even for his 6&#39; height. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening to me?!&quot; Jake gasped as he felt the energy move further into his body, he turned in desperation to the mirror behind him. His forearms swelled thicker and dense hair grew across them, Jake was terrified but increasingly caught up in the incredible pleasure of his body growing and changing. His biceps and triceps began to grow, forcing him to flex his arms and moan, the sleeves of his tshirt became tighter, leaving him with lean, muscular arms. His shoulders cracked as they broadened slightly, his pecs began to expand. He couldn&#39;t stand it, he quickly pulled his shirt over his head, and watched, panting and sweaty as his non-existent pecs pushed out of his chest, hair gushing out of his pores, he grabbed one of his expanding pecs with a large hairy hand and gasped, moaning. &quot;I... can&#39;t... fucking hell...&quot;, Jake moaned, confused and enraptured in pleasure, &quot;Can&#39;t resist... Feels so good, fuck just make me an otter!&quot; he grunted, feeling a release as he stopped resisting and the changes took over and accelerated.  <br />
<br />
Two lean, thick, hairy pecs pushed outwards, he lurched forward as his flat stomach contracted and tightened. Abs worked their way out of his stomach, sending waves of pleasure through his body, hair quickly pushing out and connecting to the top of his chest, the hair under his armpits grew thicker and denser as it also began to grow across his abs forming a thick treasure trail ... He watched the hair flow further down, knowing what was next...<br />
<br />
He clumsily fumbled with his slim, oversized hands to undo his pants, &quot;Oh, FUCK!&quot; he screamed as his hard 6 incher shot a load of cum into his underwear. He ripped the jeans off, revealing a thick bush surrounding a throbbing, leaking, growing dick. Jake moaned as his cock began to grow with each heartbeat, pushing further out of his body longer and thicker. Jake wrapped his hand around it and stroked fiercely. Every few seconds it was an inch larger than the moment before, 7&quot;, dripping with cum, pleasure intensifying as his foreskin regrew. 8&quot;, thickening like crazy with the head pulsing and expanding. 9&quot;, he grasped his ass with one hand, feeling it expand under his long, hairy fingers as it tightened, swelled and dense hair swirled across the cheeks. Jake screamed out as he shot cum onto the mirror in front of him. 10&quot; now.<br />
<br />
While some of the most intense pleasure Jake had ever experienced was over for now, the transformation was not. His balls ached as they swelled larger to better suit his hairier, more muscular body. He felt testosterone flood his body. He grunted as his adams apple expanded, his voice deepening. Thick stubble worked its way out of his neck, spreading across his face. Jake grunted as his jaw cracked, sharpening and widening. His lips tingled as they inflated slightly, his nose snapped as it readjusted, longer and wider to better suit his increasinly masculine face. His ears burned as they moved. Jake blinked hard when his eyes stung as they became a rich, beautiful brown. The hair on his head darkened to black and styled itself in a neat part. <br />
<br />
Likewise, further down hair was spreading across his thighs as they tensed up and tightened, muscle forming throughout. His long, skinny calves thickened and gushed with hair. Jake felt like he could run a marathon. He looked down seeing his formerly twig legs become lean, hairy, running machines. He looked up into the mirror and saw his new face for the first time... &quot;Oh... Fuck... I&#39;m... I&#39;m hot?!&quot; he mumbled in a deeper voice than he had previously known. He snapped out of admiring his new visage, as the ever expanding coat of hair approached his ankles, which thickened and strengthened. &quot;Oh shit..&quot; he thought, knowing what was next he attempted to pull off his tied up shoes. It was too late, he moaned as he felt his toes and soles begin to grow. His toes were hitting the ends of his size 9 converse now; he forcefully ripped the shoes off his feet as they became ever tighter. He could see his feet expanding within his socks which were tightening as well. He dropped to the floor and grabbed a foot with his big hands, pulling the sock off to reveal a larger, well-pedicured foot, hair was growing across the top and on the backs of his lengthening toes. His former size 9s were easily pushing size 12 now. He moaned as he began to massage his tense, throbbing foot, feeling the sole grow longer, the toes cracking and popping as they became long and masculine. The sock remaining on his other foot began to tear, causing Jake to shudder. His feet stopped their expansion at a lean and manly size 14. Large even for his mostly unchanged height.<br />
<br />
Jake grunted, the transformation over, pulling the shredded sock off his other foot. He looked in the mirror and smirked, &quot;Fuck. Guess I am an otter after all.&quot; His body was toned, hairy and masculine. His large cock twitched just looking at himself.<br />
<br />
Jake turned to find a set of clothes sitting on the shelf below the rings, knowing now they were for customers. He threw the attire onto his new, lean, toned, horny and hairy body. &quot;Contagious too...&quot;, Jake smirked and decided to...</p>
