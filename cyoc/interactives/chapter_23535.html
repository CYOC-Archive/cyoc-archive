<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hank threw little Mr. Mendes into the front seat of his car and drove off with the boys running and trying to catch up to him.  Ric and Josh were soon out of site.<br />
<br />
The little &quot;girly&quot; dressed Mr. Mendes looked up a Hank and demanded, &quot;You put me back wif the boys wight now you big buwwy!&quot;...needless to say, Francisco was quite embarrassed by his baby talk...and very surprised by Hank's reply.  &quot;Look, Mendes,&quot; Hank yelled at the little man, &quot;I don't care for you at all and nothing would give me more pleasure than to torture you, but, the way I see it, you've been tortured enough by those two boys.  How the hell did they do...do...THIS to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Francisco was actually growing a little bigger, though he still talked like a baby...the diaper, socks and tee shirt were getting a little tighter, &quot;They useded this book and wead a spwell.  I think that's how they made me widdle baby size and minded.  I got confuseded when I changed.  I saw them use the book when they made my body hair go away and made my hair on my head gwow weally long wike a girwl.  I'm stwarting to gwow up a'gin, but I need to get my hair back to nowrmaw.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank looked at the little man, who was indeed getting bigger.  Mendes' speech was getting better too.  &quot;Ok&quot;, Hank said, &quot;I'm going to take you home, but you have to show me the book so I can change you back.&quot;  Mr. Mendes was reluctant, &quot;No, you'll just make it worse!&quot;  Hank leaned down to the little man, &quot;Look! Do you want to change back or not?  I'm offering to help you, dammit!&quot;  In his near child like state Mr. Mended stammered, &quot;O...Okay.&quot;  Hank knew he needed to get Francisco to cooperate fast.  He was already growing so big that the diaper was about to pop off, though Mendes was still small compared to a normal man.<br />
<br />
Just as they drove into the drive way and Hank picked Francisco up to carry him in, the diaper burst off the little man.  The socks were getting too small and the tee shirt was exposing him belly. Mendes was very embarrassed that his manhood was now exposed to Hank.<br />
<br />
Hank rushed him into the house.  He saw the book on the coffee table, grabbed it and put Francisco down.  Francisco was now the size of a young boy.  He quickly took the shirt and socks off.  It was a relief to get rid of the girly and tight clothes, but now he was totally naked and hairless in front of Hank.  <br />
<br />
The instant Hank picked up the book he wondered how he would find the sequence of spells and then the book showed the spells and how they had formulated.  &quot;Ok, Mr. Mendes,&quot; Hank said as he read, &quot;The book is showing me that the baby size spell is temporary and you should be adult sized and minded pretty soon.&quot;  Indeed, Francisco was now already 4'9&quot; which meant he had less than a foot to go to his old 5'7&quot; height.  Hank, read on, &quot;I can reverse the hair spell so that you're totally normal when you hit full adult height.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank read the spell and as soon as Francisco hit 5'7&quot;, the hair on his head shrank back to his normal just over the ears length and his body hair grew back into place.  Back was his arm, leg, pit, pubic and treasure trail hair.  Hank just held onto the book, &quot;MAN! This is AWESOME!&quot;  Francisco popped a boner from the strange, erotic sensations the spells gave his body and in his momentary bliss could not reach to take the book from Hank. All he could do was say, &quot;Ok Hank, time to give me the book.  I appreciate your help.&quot;  Hank had other ideas. As he pretended to start to hand the book back, he quickly read the spell he had found while Francisco was in erotic bliss from his change back.<br />
<br />
Francisco yelled, &quot;You Fuck! Give me that book NOW!&quot; Suddenly, his hair started to grow longer.  Francisco started to shrink.  His body hair started to become less and less...and this time, he was getting younger as well. In a cracked voice as he slipped backward through puberty he yelled at Hank, &quot;What the fuck are you doing to me?!&quot;  Hank let out a hearty laugh as his former teacher continued to grow smaller and younger.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Ric and Josh ran up the sidewalk to Mr. Mendes' house.  They were tired, hot and sweaty.  They had run all the way from the Mega Store.  Just as the came to Mr. Mendes' house, the saw Hank back out of the drive way. Hank stopped in front of them and held up the book, &quot;Looking for this, brats?&quot;  Josh yelled at Hank, &quot;Hey that's our book!  Give it back!&quot;  Hank tosses the book in the seat and said, &quot;No way!  It's mine now.  You two better get in side and check on 'Mr.' Mendes.&quot;  With that, Hank sped out of the driveway.<br />
<br />
Ric and Josh ran into the house and into the living room. They heard a young child crying.  Ric looked around and said, &quot;M...Mr. Mendes?&quot;  From behind the sofa, a crying four year old child with long hair come out and stood behind the arm of the sofa so that the boys could not see below the child's waist, &quot;Wook what Hank did to me!...and it's all your fwault!&quot;  Ric was shocked, &quot;What has Hank done to you Mr. Mendes?!  You're a little boy!&quot;  The child that was Mr. Mendes stepped from behind the arm of the sofa to reveal his VAGINA, &quot;He...he...waaaa....he tuned me into a widdle girwl!  It's all your fwault! I'm weally a widdle girwl!  Waaaa!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys calmed the little girl Mendes down enough to find out that Hank made Francisco tell him where Francisco's boyfriend was working. It seems Hank now had the book and was planning to disrupt Marco's nude photo shoot at a nearby photography studio.  The boys knew there was no way they could get there in time.  They tried Marco's cel phone, but he had turned it off.where would he put it nude anyway.  The little girl Mendes was in no mental state to remember the phone number to the studio.  As the boys searched the house trying to find the number and calm the four year old girl that was their guardian at the same time, Hank was nearing his destination.</p>
