<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric and Julie calmly left the Stovall house and began to walk up Wood Street toward the center of Moon Lake and the route that would take them on to Moon Lake High School. Their pace was brisk but not rushed. They could see that Ben hadn&#39;t left yet from the Twist home as they passed the area where Anderson and Twist houses were, which meant that Ben and Nate hadn&#39;t left as part of their car pool to get Alex and then go to the school. But then, driving would allow them to move faster than Eric and Julie could move on foot, so they didn&#39;t have as much of a time constraint as Eric and Julie did.<br />
<br />
And for the moment, though, simply walking with Julie was all that mattered. There would be things to do to help him open up socially, and this was something that he would have to remember and keep in mind, but for the moment all the world revolved and around the blond haired weremermaid as far as Eric was concerned. It wasn&#39;t a bad thing to have, and that Eric kept in mind. He held Julie&#39;s hand as they walked along the street and trying to do his best to remember to keep his eyes forward to avoid tripping over something or veering off to a side. As they got to the corner where Wood Street met the outer most street that helped form the circular hub at the central part of the town, their quiet and leisurely walk was interrupted the honk of a horn, making both of them jump.<br />
<br />
That got both of them to turn to see a familiar Ford Bronco parked on the corner facing east. They could also see Spencer Lawson in the driver&#39;s seat as the hybrid were rolled down the window to lean out the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you guys need a ride?&quot; Spencer called to them.<br />
<br />
It took Eric a moment or two to catch his breath after the surprise of hearing the Bronco&#39;s horn blare at them. He looked to Julie with some concern and curiosity. As he&#39;d run into Spencer Lawson first at the time when he&#39;d been confused and worried that Julie might lose interest in him over the misunderstanding with Arthur. The meeting had included a rather passionate kiss and then Spencer&#39;s departure before Eric had even known what had happened. While the confusion between Eric and Arthur was settled, there was still the situation with Spencer Lawson. Eric had gotten the sense that Spencer had some interest in him with the possibility of also having interest in Julie as well.<br />
<br />
And that presented its own form of confusion. As a part of Eric was actually curious on some of the issue, but he had no desire to repeat his father&#39;s mistakes, and William had even urged him that if ANYTHING happened with Spencer, it would need to be with both Julie&#39;s knowledge and consent. In a sense, Eric took that as his father saying, &quot;don&#39;t do as I did&quot; to him. However, with some of the mental strain that had come from the misunderstanding with Arthur, including the session with Frances that had confirmed that Eric had a very mild form of bipolar disorder. It was judged to be situationally caused and that he wouldn&#39;t need medication, which was good, but all the chaos that had gone around that had also meant that Eric and Julie had never had a moment where the subject of Spencer could be discussed. Though, discussing whether or not Julie had any interest in Spencer, or women at all for that matter, probably wasn&#39;t something to be discussed in front of Spencer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it could hurt to take a ride,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;it could give us some more time before we have to get to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and they carefully crossed the street and soon climbed into the Bronco&#39;s back seat. Spencer sort of sighed as Eric joined Julie in the backseat with little real interest in her. She waited until she heard their seatbelts click before pulling forward and flipping the turn signal to head toward the high school. As they got going, Spencer did get some questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what brings you out here?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I actually don&#39;t live too far away,&quot; Spencer answered, &quot;And I thought it a good idea be there for some friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s quite generous,&quot; Julie commented, &quot;How have things gone with Morgan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relatively well,&quot; Spencer answered, &quot;with plenty of fun to be had...&quot; She silently thought that it might be even more fun if we were all there together, but given how she&#39;d been raised to respect people&#39;s wishes if they weren&#39;t interested and her parents had been firm on that. She might have had her bouts of teenage rebellion for attention, but she also knew well where her parents drew the line on certain things. Spencer wasn&#39;t going to pick a fight on that, and to a certain extent, she even agreed with it. &quot;Though... on some level, getting him more open... and more... adept at social interaction may take some work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Julie commented with Eric nodding beside her, with both knowing that Eric essentially had to deal with the same issues.<br />
<br />
Spencer nodded as they rode along as well. They eventually made it to the parking lot for Moon Lake High&#39;s students, which was seeing many of the first students arrive as the start of the school day got ever closer. She hoped she might be able to get them into voicing some idea or plan that could allow something special for the three of them, but so far, things remained rather mundane.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might help to find things he has an interest in... see if any of them would potentially require more than just himself to do... or could be something that others have interests in and thus he could talk about those things with others,&quot; Eric offered, &quot;even if it means testing new waters to some extent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Spencer began, &quot;that actually doesn&#39;t sound like too bad an idea. How...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say that Morgan and I actually have a few things in common,&quot; Eric commented, though he figured that he might have already shared this, though wasn&#39;t one hundred percent sure. &quot;It&#39;s something that lets me understand the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer nodded to that, though she desperately wanted to give a heavy sigh at that. She did want to help Morgan, and a part of her really did like him. But a lot of that also related heavily to many of the other parts of her that just wanted to have fun and experiment with things. Potentially having fun with Eric and Julie was one of those things that she considered as well. However, she wasn&#39;t fully sure on how to work that into play, because she didn&#39;t necessarily want to break the two up. As from what she&#39;d learned and found out, the two did seem to love each other, and while Spencer might have had her rebellious streaks, she wasn&#39;t about to deny anyone their true love.<br />
<br />
However, she did feel drawn to both weremers in ways she couldn&#39;t explain. Some of it was possibly a carry over from her parent&#39;s own marriage. Her mother and father were happily married, and Spencer had the sense that her father was the only man for her mother. However, that didn&#39;t mean that her mother, who was part wereleopard part werecat didn&#39;t have her own same sex desires as well. It had been rather rare to run into other weres, let alone other bisexual female weres while her father had been with his career. However, when a bisexual female were was found, Spencer knew that her mother was easily drawn in and her father had more than tolerated it. It didn&#39;t hurt their marriage in any way. Spencer figured she could arrange the same sort of thing between her and the two weremers she was with as well, perhaps even bringing Morgan in for some rather extensive fun.<br />
<br />
However, as she came out of the hormonally charged heat that she&#39;d been in and had a bit more control over herself, she wasn&#39;t quite sure on just how to go about it. Eric and Julie had seemed to accept the whole &quot;friends with benefits&quot; idea, which could be a good first step as it were. However, Spencer also had the sense that a &quot;first step&quot; did not mean that directly saying, &quot;I&#39;d like to take both of you to bed&quot; wouldn&#39;t work well, and not just because it was broad daylight and outside the school. It was also the fact that much of the conversation between them had also focused on her relations with Morgan, who Spencer also did wish to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any interesting plans for the weekend?&quot; Spencer inquired, &quot;Finally figure out what&#39;s all true with these rumors?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s likely that none of those rumors are true,&quot; Julie gave a grumble, &quot;I mean... you said your dad was in the Marines?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Navy SEALs,&quot; Spencer corrected, &quot;the Navy&#39;s special forces as it were. Technically, I suppose a Marine could become a Navy SEAL, as the Marine Corps is under the Department of the Navy... but I&#39;m not one hundred percent sure on that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not super big there,&quot; Julie gave a shrug, &quot;the point though... is that would your dad essentially condone what would amount to armed resistance against the US?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Spencer said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which then shows that the rumors about Moon Lake going to war with the state of Washington being false when one considers that there are likely to be just as many weres who are patriotic Americas as WELL as being weres,&quot; Julie pointed out as they reached the steps that lead up toward the front doors to the school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Spencer agreed, and getting some realization that from there, part of her &quot;fishing&quot; expedition wasn&#39;t going to work.</p>
