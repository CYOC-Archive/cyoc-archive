<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where to?&quot; asked Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Around the park,&quot; Tricia said as she took the remote from her friend. &quot;To show off our new looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam checked herself over just to be sure she was back to normal. &quot;I don&#39;t have a new look,&quot; she said. Then it dawned on her. &quot;Ugh. What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish gave Sam a cute smile before punching more buttons on the remote. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted my own pet to walk,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Sam waited patiently, sighing frequently, until Trish was done programming her new form. She prepared herself for the worst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I don&#39;t want you to be frightened. Just relax and enjoy the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s comforting,&quot; Sam retorted. &quot;Now I&#39;m more scared than ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish giggled as she shot Sam with the remote again, then turned her back. Instantly, Sam&#39;s clothes vanished. Unlike the other times when it transformed into something different, the vague form of the fabric didn&#39;t linger. She was rendered completely naked. Sam covered her crotch with one hand and crossed the other arm over her breasts. &quot;TRISH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so loud,&quot; Trish said, still looking in the opposite direction. She seemed to be working on the remote some more. &quot;People might come around these bushes and see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha was suddenly very grateful they had found a secluded area of the park for this. She didn&#39;t have long to think about it, however, as more changes happened across her body. <br />
<br />
The first thing she felt was an uncomfortable itching that accompanied the growth of black fur. In a minute, her entire body from head to toe was covered in thick midnight black fur. Her muscles ached as they gained girth and strength. And then her body grows up, a meter or so. Her calves shorten, followed with her legs, before shifting to her sides into animal hindquarters. Surprisingly, there was no pain involved, although she can hear bones bending and cracking as they took on an inhuman structure. Then her feet widen on the front, and one of her toes merged. The result is she have four toes instead of five. A brief burst of pain makes Sam hisses in pain, and she looks at her toes again, each now sported a big, black, claw.<br />
<br />
She can feel her spines popped, as new segments were added before growing longer. Her legs grows longer and thicker, which ends up with her slamming her elbow to the ground. And then her waist bulked-up. Her breasts stay the same, but compared to her hulking body, it is much smaller - and she can feel additional ribs grow in her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaa-&quot; her question is cut short as her body jostles, shoulder lengthening, giving her more &#39;broad&#39; looks. And then her necks lengthened slightly, before thickened more. &quot;What did yooooo... grrr ddd... to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam can feel her arms bulked out, both hands grow smaller, as is her fingers. And like her toes, a massive, black claws grows out of it as well. The arms itself grows slightly shorter, and with some effort, Sam managed to lift herself. Her spines grow more, above her butt, before becomes a tail. She caan see she don&#39;t have arms anymore - it is now legs, and she is basically a massive, four-legged animals. Likely dog, she think. <br />
<br />
Though her head is still human. It will soon change, though.<br />
<br />
A sudden pain at her lower-jaw surprised Sam. Her cheeks split, this time painless. It broadened, and grows, and finally become a lower jaw of a canine. Her teeths changed, become sharper, with longer, well, canines, and more suited for carnivore. Her tongues thickened as well, the structure changed, so it can be used better. Soon, the upper jaw follows, and with it Sam&#39;s nose, and eyes as well. <br />
<br />
Sam feels slight disorientation, and she squints her eyes. The world appears as monochrome now, though colors do exist - they just... switched, and unusual for her sense. What surprises her the most is her sense of smell - it is now much more acute, and Sam whined pitifully as her brain is overwhelmed - she clumsily moves her body backs, her head down to her front paws, trying to shield her nose. Her changes has yet to be completed, though.<br />
<br />
Her ears moved-up to the top of her head, and her hair retract itself to her skull. And of course, her skull changes, and with it, her brains as well. Senses are reduced and boosted - Sights are reduced, the previous fully-coloured world now become monochrome with occasional splash of flipped, alien, colours; consequently, Sam cannot recognize the difference between human, at least by sight alone - all she sees are some kind of bipedal, hairless being. She can recognizes gesture, of course, to a limited extent her canine mind would allow.<br />
<br />
Her olfactory sense fills the void left by her visual sense, however. Sam can smell the grass, the different people that walks on it, and of course, their individual scent. She can smell the slight metallic taste of city air, mixed with a hint of smoke, owing to pollution. And then the remote changes her hearing more, and now, she can hears children laughing a blocks away from the park.<br />
<br />
Of course, Trish isn&#39;t some mad goddess trying to change Sam to her personal hellhound that can kill on her command. So, Trish set the remote to fully translate Sam&#39;s human mind, to her canine mind. Sam can recognize Trish by her complex scent, the memories of how she looks like faded to how she expresses her body language. Her language facility atrophied, but Sam can pickup different emotions much faster and clearly now.<br />
<br />
And then the changes speed up.<br />
<br />
Mucles thickened, and grows. Bones lengthened. Shoulder broadened. Her furs grow thicker, midnight-black everywhere but her underside. Two additional rows of breasts grows at her underside, and Sam herself keep growing until she is fully above the trees at the park!<br />
<br />
The changes finally subsides, but Sam still feels lingering itchy feeling from the fur and senses-shock from her transition. She tried to sniff Trish, finding her standing in front of her - she smells satisfied and content, though she seems much smaller than before - and then Sam realized that Trish had made herself much younger, with decorative bat wings at her heads and her backs. She also gestured wildly for Sam to back-off, though. <br />
<br />
Confused, Sam backs off. And then another changes happen.<br />
<br />
The first thing that Sam feels are somethings growing inside her body. Unbeknownst to Sam, her heart gots bigger, and then additonal pairs of lungs grows. Her body can&#39;t contain those, though, so it broadened. She now have three pairs of lung, with massive hears that can handle it.<br />
<br />
The second thing is her shoulder broadened. Broadened so much, in fact, that Sam wonders what this means before she got a massive headaches. The headaches gets worse, and Sam can feel her heads split - literally, in this case. She can feels some part of her personality splits, to act as seeds for her other self to occupy. Then suddenly, everything stopped. She yips confusedly, trying to look at her right, only to see a massive, frightening head of a dog stared back at her, it&#39;s eyes mostly black without visible pupils. She yelps, and it also yelps, trying to move away from the dog before they&#39;ve fallen down - and Sam slams against something on her left, which turns out the be another head.<br />
<br />
The remotes makes the final changes on Sam&#39;s brain (or maybe it is Sams&#39; brains?), granting them near-perfect ability to reads&#39; each-others intent, with their own special &#39;language&#39; consisting of growl, whine, and yep, to help them communicate and coordinate to each other. Sam also realized that each heads are identical to each-others, including the brains - which means, they are all Sam. Still, if they remains in this form long enough, they may each develop different personalities, though.<br />
<br />
With the changes finally complete, Sam standing up on all-four. She moves to Trish, who now seems delighted before babbling excited-sounding voice and turn the remotes to her again. Her left head seems especially annoyed with this, and Sam growls in agreement before all heads whine as a leash forms at the three heads. Trish then walks forward, intent on enjoying this fine day with her changed friend~</p>
