<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile in their cave Jim and Abby settled down into relax. Despite both of them being much larger than they had been when they first entered the cave, they weren&#39;t that hungry. Abby&#39;s central had a good idea on what her lust filled head wanted to do, but there were still some more important things that the two of them needed to deal with. That namely had to do with the box of vials, the box that had so far lead to so much trouble that the area had endured. The fairies, the griffons, Sandra, and themselves had all been changed by the vials powers. In the hands of those looking for some innocent fun, the vials weren&#39;t necessarily that much of a threat, but given their powers, if they fell into the wrong hands, real trouble would be sure to follow. The whole battle against Sandra had proven that. While it left Jim and Abby strong enough to deal with just about anything, they also knew that Sandra wasn&#39;t dead and might at some point come looking for the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think we&#39;ve done well,&quot; Abby&#39;s central head commented, &quot;it may be a cave... but it&#39;s better than it was now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing what removing all the bones Sandra left laying around and stinking up the place will do,&quot; her angry head commented somewhat sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Jim&#39;s noble head nodded in agreement to that, &quot;We&#39;ve done well... but there is one more thing that we kneed to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mate,&quot; Abby&#39;s lust filled head gave a smile and Abby felt a tinge of arousal go through her body.<br />
<br />
Jim&#39;s romantic head looked back with some interest, and was already thinking of a way to make it beautiful but his noble head soon countered those thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;More to be sure that someone like Sandra can&#39;t come back take the box,&quot; Jim&#39;s noble head spoke, &quot;we&#39;d gotten pretty lucky in defeating her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;ve hidden the box,&quot; Jim&#39;s carefree head argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who in their right mind is going to try and steal it from us?&quot; Abby&#39;s angry head questioned, &quot;we may not go out and threaten humans... but they&#39;ll surely know that we&#39;re here and they can&#39;t easily harm us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That assumes one of us remains in the cave,&quot; Abby&#39;s intelligent head commented, &quot;which may not be possible. We&#39;re already great beasts of this earth and air and it will take much to feed us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s intelligent head looked to her lustful head and Jim&#39;s romantic head before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the future we will surely have eggs and little dragon/hydra hybrids to raise, and they will require food as well,&quot; Abby&#39;s intelligent head spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll both have to leave the cave to go hunting to feed both ourselves and our future children,&quot; Jim&#39;s scientific head surmised from the point made by Abby&#39;s intelligent head.<br />
<br />
&quot;And given our sizes, we may have to range over a wide area to go hunting for deer, fish, and other sources of protein to feed us,&quot; Abby&#39;s intelligent head nodded, &quot;which means we cannot devote a lot of time to making sure no one comes in and searches the cave until they find where we&#39;ve presently hidden it.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that made some sense. They had hidden the box of vials, but given how determined Sandra had been to get Jim to be her love slave and even how willing she was to make an attempt to get at the box after being transformed back into a human, if they left to get food for themselves or for their future children, the box would likely be without a real guardian. If Sandra remained, or if she told someone about the box and that someone was like her, it wouldn&#39;t take them long to find the box and use the vials for the wrong reasons or the wrong purposes. They would have to do something more with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you suppose we do with it then, destroy it?&quot; Abby&#39;s surly head asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The vials aren&#39;t the problem,&quot; Jim&#39;s carefree head commented, &quot;it&#39;s what bad people would do with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim&#39;s noble head nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that the griffons and the fairies might have need of the vials in the future,&quot; Jim&#39;s understanding head commented, &quot;to either make more fairies or more griffons. Junn even said that he and Bechana had eggs that would be hatching soon. When their children grow up... are we do deny them the opportunity to find love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The human vial was destroyed,&quot; Abby spoke, &quot;we can&#39;t just use the vials to turn people into mythical creatures...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor should we turn our hatchlings into weak humans,&quot; Abby&#39;s ambitious head countered, &quot;even if we could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any transformations would have to be willing,&quot; Jim&#39;s noble head.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they don&#39;t have to become human to find love and nor would a human have to change to find love as well,&quot; Jim&#39;s romantic head added, &quot;that would be more up to their own futures. And if the transformation is willing, we can make sure the person is aware of all the related consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
The following nods from all the heads present let Abby know that they agreed to keep the box around. The real question was to how to hide the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do with the box?&quot; Abby asked, &quot;how do we hide in a way that we can be sure no one will find it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we can either give it to the fairies or the griffons to let them hide it,&quot; Abby&#39;s intelligent head commented, &quot;as the fairies have their magic and could enchant the box to keep those with black hearts from taking it... and the griffons live further from the town than we are right now. Any hunters might not be easily looking for it there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But then we wouldn&#39;t control it,&quot; Abby&#39;s ambitious head argued, &quot;they all wanted to destroy it while there was the threat of Sandra getting it. Who&#39;s to say they won&#39;t still destroy it now. I say we keep it and control it. If someone good wants a vial... we can share it. If someone bad tries... we can deal with them. In the end WE control its power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as it&#39;s used responsibly, there is no problem,&quot; Jim&#39;s noble head reminded Abby&#39;s ambitious head, &quot;the real question is how will we protect the box in a way that someone won&#39;t find it while we&#39;re gone to hunt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim&#39;s noble head paused while both his other heads and Abby&#39;s heads began to think over a possible solutions. That was really the biggest issue that they had with regard to the box. Jim was confident they could keep it safe while they were there. The biggest concern was what do while they were out hunting for food.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we buried it?&quot; Abby&#39;s intelligent head wondered, &quot;this level is thick enough to support our weight...&quot; She raised up Abby&#39;s right foreleg and flexed the massive slate gray scaled paws tipped with the massive claws. &quot;We can easily dig a hole deep enough to bury the box. Even if someone finds it, it&#39;d take them time to uncover it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds partially right...&quot; Jim&#39;s scientific head commented, &quot;maybe we could dig into the wall above where a human could reach. That&#39;d then secure the box against humans and leave us as the judges as to the intent of people wanting the box or a vial from the box.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Abby&#39;s ambitious head smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would we manage that?&quot; Abby wondered, &quot;in becoming dragon/hydra hybrids, we became quadrupeds... being on two legs is a bit difficult... and we&#39;re so big that while we fit in the cave as we are, if we rear up... we&#39;ll hit our heads.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d take some hunching down and bending down with our necks,&quot; Jim&#39;s scientific head answered, &quot;and you could use acid to help carve out the niche in the cave wall to place the box in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I and my confident head can help as well,&quot; said Jim&#39;s carefree head commented while his cocky head nodded.<br />
<br />
They did lead to some nodding as they agreed and began working to carve out a hole in the cave wall to hide the box in. It lead to a tight squeeze and both of them bumped their heads a few times on the ceiling of the cave, but it did well enough to get a niche made so that the box could be kept safe. The was a small pile of rocks that formed at the base of the wall underneath where they&#39;d worked to make the niche in the wall. Once they had it deep enough, Jim&#39;s scientific head sprayed a liquid base into the niche and watched the acid from Abby&#39;s ambitious and surly heads and his own carefree and cocky heads react and ultimately settle into a neutral pH balance.  Once that niche was safe, Jim moved to where the box was hidden, moved the tree branches that hid it and lifted the box up in the mouth of his noble head. It was then placed in the niche in the wall, too high to be reached by humans and deep enough that no one would see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Jim&#39;s noble head spoke, &quot;now just to get the rocks back up to fill the niche and truly hide the box.&quot;<br />
<br />
That took a bit of effort and maneuvering, as many of the rocks were rather small thanks to the pawing and clawing out of the niche that Jim and Abby had both done in making it, but it did work. The rocks managed to cover the box, or at least fill up the opening to the niche. A few small stones fell from it, but they didn&#39;t affect the intent of it. With that, the box was safely hidden, and Jim felt supremely confident that if he and Abby needed it in the future so that their children might have mates, or if the griffons needed it so that their children could have mates they could access it. If some normal human somehow knew of the box&#39;s existence, Jim was also confident that he and Abby would be able to make sure that the person wasn&#39;t like Sandra in trying to take over the town or the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... now what?&quot; Abby&#39;s central head asked.<br />
<br />
She tried to keep from blushing as Jim&#39;s romantic head came forward and managed to kiss her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d think now, with all of the business out of the way... we settle in for a very romantic evening,&quot; Jim&#39;s romantic head smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Romance?&quot; Abby&#39;s lust filled head commented, &quot;I&#39;d rather see how many orgasms we can have before we get tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could,&quot; Jim&#39;s romantic head smiled, &quot;if that&#39;s what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As we are yours,&quot; Jim&#39;s noble head added.<br />
<br />
Abby only smiled back.</p>
