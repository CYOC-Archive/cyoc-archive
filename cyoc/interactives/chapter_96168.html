<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on!  Give them back!  I can&#39;t see without them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrick, or &quot;Roddy&quot; to his friends (&quot;the Rod&quot; to some girls) held the small boy&#39;s glasses higher over his head.  Rodrick had a good two feet on the kid, making reaching the eye wear an impossible endeavor.<br />
<br />
Rodrick laughed as the small freshman jumped feebly for his glasses.  &quot;Oh!  You almost got them that time.  Keep jumping!  You&#39;re almost there!&quot;  As the star, senior quarterback (is there any other kind?), Roddy often made sure the smaller kids knew who was boss.  He could very easily do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.  Heck, since his sophomore year he could have any girl he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rodrick, stop being an asshole and give the kid his damn glasses back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Every girl except for her.  Rodrick looked up to see Emily Piper, her perfect face scrunched into a glare.  She was possibly the prettiest girl in school.  Of all the fish he&#39;d yet to catch, she was the finest.  However, she had yet to learn to accept Rodrick&#39;s authority over the other students.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rodrick,&quot; she repeated, crossing her arms angrily.  &quot;Don&#39;t make me smack that shit-eating grin right off your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
The jock shrugged and held the glasses even high over his head.  The freshman continued to hop, falling comically short of his goal.  Emily rolled her eyes and took a threatening step toward him, her fists clenched.<br />
<br />
Rodrick sighed and began lowering the kid&#39;s glasses.  &quot;Alright, alright.  Chill.  I&#39;ll give the kid back his glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily stopped, seemingly pacified.  Before the freshman could retrieve his glasses, Rodrick reared back and threw his glasses down the main hall.  His impressive throwing skills sent the lenses hurtling through the air before smashing into a set of lockers.  Rodrick dusted his hands and grinned at Emily.  &quot;There.  All his.&quot;<br />
<br />
The freshman ran off toward the sound his glasses had made as they impacted the lockers.  Emily turned and glowered at Rodrick.  &quot;What the hell is your problem?  He didn&#39;t even do anything to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrick smirked and shrugged.  &quot;Y&#39;know, you&#39;re lucky my momma taught me right and I don&#39;t hit girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily scoffed.  &quot;Well, don&#39;t hold back on my account.  I&#39;d love to teach you a lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrick took a step back and held his arms out.  &quot;Then take your best shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily grated her teeth as she clenched and unclenched her fists.  Her posture then relaxed and her arms fell limp.  &quot;You know what?  I&#39;m going to be the bigger person.  I&#39;m not going down to your level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrick glared back at her.  &quot;Good.  Because I don&#39;t want you anyway.&quot;  That was a lie.  He wanted her so bad right now.<br />
<br />
Emily glowered and stepped past him, making her way to help out the freshman with the shattered glasses.  &quot;Go be a creep somewhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrick watched her go.  He wasn&#39;t sure if this was a victory for him or not.  The bell rang, signaling he should go to his next class.  He glanced at her one last time as she handed the broken remains of the freshman&#39;s frames to the small kid, before he took off and made his way to Gym Class.  He could puzzle over the enigma that was Emily Piper later.<br />
<br />
Rodrick entered the locker room behind the gym.  There he saw many of his other teammates.  There was Zane, the running back; Dustin, the kicker; and Big Rich, a linebacker; among others.  Of course, the locker room also held some other, less athletic kids.  Rodrick and his buddies did their best to give them a hard time before they got dressed as quickly as possible before rushing out of the room.  Just for kicks, Zane grabbed a stick of abandoned deodorant and smeared it all over the inside of one of their lockers.  &quot;They gotta learn to lock these things when they&#39;re done with&#39;em.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrick was the standing epitome of teenage jock.  He was fairly tall, scraping past six feet.  His head was topped with thick, blonde-red hair, gelled to curl up at the front.  He had an impressive pair of sideburns and just enough stubble on his chin to show off his masculinity without looking sloppy.  He was fairly well muscled, but not too large to hinder him on the field.  He liked to wear extra short sleeves to help show off his large biceps.  He&#39;d won many a woman with that simple tactic.  His large pecs helped as well, their shape defined even through his shirt.  He took care to make sure he stayed hairless.  As far as he was concerned, smooth was in and he made sure to shave his body hair at least once a week.  Though, he was gifted in that he was naturally mostly smooth, anyway.<br />
<br />
As Rodrick pulled out his gym clothes and undressed, he spotted a golden twinkle under his gym shorts.  Pulling them aside, he saw what appeared to be a pair of men&#39;s underwear.  It was the standard white, except for the elastic band, which was a shiny, almost metallic, gold color.  Rodrick picked up the underwear and looked them over.  There didn&#39;t seem to be any brand names on the elastic, and there wasn&#39;t even a tag declaring a size.  They looked as though they would fit him, though.<br />
<br />
Dustin leaned in over Rodrick&#39;s shoulder, still only half dressed in his gym clothes.  &quot;What&#39;cha got there, Roddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Big Rich laughed.  &quot;Hey!  Is that some fancy underwear, or somethin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rodrick plunged the gold-banded underwear back into his locker.  &quot;Hey!  My clothes are none of your business.  Get me?&quot;<br />
<br />
His teammates immediately backed off.  &quot;Hey, hey.  Take it easy, Roddy.  We didn&#39;t mean anything by it.  It was just some weird underwear, is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
His dominance reestablished, Rodrick smirked and shrugged.  &quot;No big, guys.  Just stay away from my stuff, &#39;kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, whatever, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roderick&#39;s teammates finished changing into their gym clothes and left the locker room, one by one.  Roderick was sure to dress extra slow, waiting for the others to leave him alone in the locker room.  Once he was by himself, Roderick pulled out the weird pair of underwear again.  The fabric felt incredibly soft and pliable.  He tentatively brought the fabric to his nose and sniffed.  They smelled fresh, too, as if they&#39;d just been washed.  What would somebody put a fancy pair of freshly washed underwear in his locker for?  Maybe it was placed there by mistake by their previous owner?  But that was impossible.  His locker had been locked.  Roderick played with the underwear in his hands, feeling their softness.  Well, whatever the case, they had been in his locker, so they were his now.  He wondered how they would feel should he wear them during gym class.<br />
<br />
The jock smirked and removed his gym shorts and boxers, before slipping on the weird underwear.  They felt incredibly soft against his crotch.  In fact, they made his crotch tingle.  The tingle began spreading out form his crotch, up his torso, and down his legs.  Roderick then began to worry that, perhaps he had been pranked and the underwear contained itching powder.  He reached down to remove the underwear, but, to his horror, he couldn&#39;t find where the golden elastic ended and his flesh began.  It was if the fabric had fused to his very skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He began to claw at the underwear before the tingling reached his fingertips.  He watched to his horror as his finger seemed to deflate, as if his skin was but a balloon filled with air, which was slowly being let out.  The skin of his hands turned what and acquired the texture of fabric.  His arms began to wither away, retracting into his body.  It was then that he noticed the lockers around his seemed to be getting taller.  He was shrinking!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!  What the fuck?  What the FUCK?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He moved to run from the locker room, but collapsed as his legs withered away, transforming into useless white fabric being absorbed into the underwear.  He tried turning himself over, but his arms had long since absorbed into his torso, which was also beginning to deflate and be absorbed into the underwear.  Rodrick could feel his lungs collapsing and, to his horror, his heart stop beating as he withered away.  He tried screaming, but with no lungs he could produce no sound.  The world around him loomed larger and larger and he felt what remained of his body be dragged into the underwear.  Soon, everything went dark.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then everything was bright again.  Or, at least as the locker room behind the gym could be.  Rodrick found he could see.  He knew he didn&#39;t have eyes, but he still had his sense of sight.  Not only that, but he could feel the cold ground beneath him, as well.  After some practice, he found he could activate and deactivate each of his senses at will.  He quickly stopped experimenting when he accidentally started tasting the ground.  Despite this, however, he couldn&#39;t move.  At this point, he didn&#39;t know if he even had any muscles to move with.  He quickly gathered his bearings and discovered, to his horror, that he was now the gold-banded underwear he had found before.  He had fused with the pair, becoming one with them.  He became nervous.  Was he stuck like this forever?  What would happen if somebody found him?  He did not want to wind up as a pair of underwear for the rest of his life?  What did &quot;the rest of his life&quot; even mean now that he was underwear?<br />
<br />
Rodrick tried his hardest to move, but found himself still immobile.  He tried yelling, but without a mouth and lungs, that was a no go as well.  As an act of desperation he tried calling out with his mind, hoping to contact somebody telepathically.  There was nothing.  Despite his lack of adrenaline and other hormones, Rodrick began to panic once again.  Here he was, a pair of underwear, by himself, in a boy&#39;s locker room at his high school.  What was he to do?</p>
