<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On that particular morning something was off about the sauna. Lilianna couldn&#39;t tell what it was as she looked at the shimmering magic it produced as she run her hand on the wood. The magic was slimier and more tainted looking than usual and it gave off a more green and purple color than the usual pastel colored rainbow.<br />
<br />
Lilianna was only using the sauna for her own purposes and had bought it from a reliabe source. The original maker was an elf carpenter who had made it out of pixie wood. Lilianna knew that pixie wood was quite sensitive when it came to magic use. Most of the powerful wands made of it&#39;s wood and as such any magical effect it produces was powerful. Only downside was that some people had told tales that their wands had misfired or exploded randomly. Lilianna shook her head as she couldn&#39;t believe that this was the case. Not right now when she had a customer with a hefty purse. It had to work like it usually did, right?<br />
<br />
Tommy in other hand was getting impatient as Lilianna knocked on the wood and spent way more time doing the usual set-up for the exchange process. She put the glass vials to the sap extrator like usual and wanted to give a call to the carpenter who made it. Maybe she could do it while his client was in the sauna and keep an eye on him while she gives a call to the carpenter.<br />
<br />
So, Lilianna handed Tommy a towel and explained how the sauna worked. She told Tommy how long he should be inside it to achieve the results he wished for. There was a small glass window on the door that displayed a big clock on opposite side of the sauna that if clients wanted. They could get the precise timing and wouldn&#39;t need to eyeball their age. As her client as also a Rockman&#39;s family remember she guarantee&#39;d to him that he could just give him a freebie for the rejuvenating massage if he wanted a precise age.<br />
<br />
Tommy nodded and opened the sauna&#39;s door while Lilianna gave a call to the carpenter to explain the situation.<br />
<br />
Lilianna tried to call the elf but she could get hold of him. It seemed that he wasn&#39;t answering the call and let it rang for 5 minutes as it affected her business. During that time Lilianna had spent her whole time reading the newspaper as the phone kept ringing and wasn&#39;t paying any attention what was happening inside the sauna.<br />
<br />
During those five minutes a disaster struck.<br />
<br />
As Tommy entered the sauna and took a seat he could already feeling himself getting older. He had full trust in Lilianna and kept eyeing the clock outside of the window.<br />
<br />
He thought to himself that he wanted to be a 21-year-old adult for a day so he could experience the adult life how he had imagined to be. Drinking, talking with important people and having fun with his friends as he was old enough to host parties as an adult. Tommy&#39;s personal math teacher has told him how good he was at math and as he watched the clock a minute had already passed. He had to wait there for fourteen more minutes until he was at the age of twenty two.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and didn&#39;t notices that the pixie wood was sucking more oils and liquids out of Tommy&#39;s body as he swetead. The aging was five times as potent meaning the 10-year-old boy had already grown to her 14th birthday and was rapidly aging.<br />
<br />
At the same time the Eucalyptus mixture that Lilianna had made to ensure his customer&#39;s kept their looks wasn&#39;t working properly and was only doing one fifth of the effect. Meaning that Tommy didn&#39;t get as handsome as he should have and looked above average as he relaxed inside the sauna. After two minutes Tommy was now 18-year-old young man with normal looking body and face. His puberty went past him like a bullet train and and only left him with splash of testoterone he should have had. He didn&#39;t grow past his child-like size and everything he could have gained was lost. At the age 20 he only looked like a high schooler. This also affected her maturity as he could only think like a 15-year-old.<br />
<br />
At the third minute of transformation Tommy woke up from the wooden bench and looked at the clock. He was sure that the sauna was real deal by looking at his own body. He was mentally boasting and inflating his own ego that he looked like his own father from a distance. He had the physique of his father and was sure that one day he&#39;s going to inherit his spot as the most successful football player in the world. Tommy stretched his small muscles and was confused how frail they looked. He imagined that in three years he should have gained more mass.<br />
<br />
Sadly the now 24-year-old wasn&#39;t aware that his transformation was not working properly as Tommy started to think more like a 14-year-old. He became a little bit more aware of his own body and was weirded out by the amount of hair that was growing in places that was only meant for old men. He lifted his feet on the same level as he was and saw that the hair was rapidly growing from her toes. Tommy touched his face and was sure that a 13 to 14 year old shouldn&#39;t have this much hair. It was like fishstick was attached under his nose. A happy trail begun to reach his stomach as Tommy looked downwards at his own smaller than average sized dick. His mental state switched gears as he was thinking like a 21-year-old and begun to notice all the red flags happening in his body.<br />
<br />
The clock on the opposide side of the sauna only displayed that four minutes had passed and the just above 5-feet tall Tommy got a panic attack as he run outside the sauna naked and fell on the floor. Tommy stood up and quickly yoinked his towel with him and begun to rage as he clearly looked like a hairy 28-year-old man rather than the muscular 14-year-old what he should had been. <br />
<br />
He quickly rushed to the reception area where Lilianna got hold to the elf that had build the sauna for her. <br />
<br />
In the same moment where the elf had told her not to put people inside it as it might need magical cleaning. Tommy slammed his fist on the desk which almost sent Lilianna flying as she witnessed what kind of damage the sauna had done.<br />
<br />
The angry 28-year-old 5-feet and 8-inches tall lone island survivor look-a-like named Tommy Rockman only towel as his own cloth was causing a scene in front of the reception desk. He shouted and screamed so loudly that other customers that were standing up and paying attention what was going on. They were shocked to see a guy like Tommy acting this way on a spa that was usually calm and quiet.<br />
<br />
Lilianna had to act fast as the elf on the other end of the phone went silent.</p>
