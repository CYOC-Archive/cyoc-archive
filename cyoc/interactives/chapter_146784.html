<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emilio was walking down Jeff&#39;s street, with little on his mind. He was simply minding his own business, with not much to care about at the moment. &#39;Twas the norm for summer days, not much to do but to play video games and... other acts.<br />
<br />
He decided to walk downtown, perhaps there was something to do there. Once he arrived, he was disappointed, but not surprised to see that there wasn&#39;t much of anything happening- just people minding their own business.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he noticed a girl walking in his direction on the sidewalk. She was exactly his type- blonde, big-breasted, and... well, that was about all &quot;his type&quot; was. Emilio couldn&#39;t take his eyes off her body. His dick began to harden, as usual when aroused. Luckily, he was wearing baggy jeans, so it wouldn&#39;t be hard to hide his erection. However, this time, he felt a bit strange. His scalp was itching, his chest was tingling, and he began to feel a little light-headed. Not wanting to cause a scene, especially in front of the eye candy walking past him, he ducked into a conveniently placed shady alley.<br />
<br />
He began to furiously scratch the top of his head, but nothing would calm the irritation. It felt like his hair was rapidly growing- but now, that was impossible, wasn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
Emilio felt another pain in his crotch. He still had a boner, but his balls shriveled up until they were completely gone- unbeknownst to him, they were inside his body and were in the process of converting to ovaries. He let out a pained gasp. This couldn&#39;t be happening. What was going on? Had he been poisoned?<br />
<br />
Similar pains began to erupt all over his body. His muscles started softening and losing definition, his body hair retracted into his body until his skin was completely smooth save for his eyebrows and head, and he began to feel a swelling pain coming from behind his nipples. Despite still being erect, his dick felt like it was getting smaller. Confident that no one would peer into the alley, he lowered his pants to reveal that just that was happening. 4 inches, 3 inches, 2 inches, until it seemed to stop at about 1 inch long, and still hard.<br />
<br />
His hair was definitely growing now, and it seemed to be getting a shade or two lighter- not extremely noticeable, but a trained eye could see it. The worst pains so far started coming from his bones- he was physically getting shorter. He began to shrink, going from 5&#39;11 to about 5&#39; 1&quot; in ten seconds flat. His overall body shape changed too- his rear inflated, his hips widened, his waist pinched inward, and his limbs became more slender. He attempted to resist the urge to scream- but the sounds that did manage to escape from his mouth were starting to sound more high-pitched.<br />
<br />
At this point, Emilio looked very feminine, with long hair, smooth, slender arms and legs, and dainty fingers. Any body fat had disappeared. The only thing keeping him male was the lack of breasts and his one-inch dick. That soon ended, however. His penis shrunk away completely, allowing a hairless, virgin pussy to open below. At the same time, breasts sprung out of her chest, and grew to about a B-cup. Emilio was now Emily, and the only thing out of place was her large, baggy male clothes. Immediately, her undershirt and boxer shorts reformed into a simple bra and pair of panties. Her striped shirt changed to fit her new female torso, reducing slightly to resemble a crop top (without showing off her midriff). Her baggy male jeans became a pair of women&#39;s skinny jeans, tightly hugging her legs and crotch. Her sneakers became a similar-looking pair of women&#39;s cross-trainers.<br />
<br />
New feelings began to flood into her brain. She knew she was supposed to be a guy, and had memories to support them, but they became accompanied with the knowledge of how to clasp a bra, how to use menstrual products, and the like. She found that she was still only attracted to women, which was reassuring. <br />
<br />
Her transformation complete, Emily put her pants back on and exited the alley, all the while attempting to resist a mental breakdown. Disoriented and unsure what to do, she decided to return to her house- her parents wouldn&#39;t be home for a while. Walking now felt strange- her legs were shorter and her breasts threw her off balance a bit.<br />
<br />
Once she arrived back home, she dashed to her room, and found that it had not changed- it was still clearly a boy&#39;s room, with pictures of her as a guy on the shelves. Deciding now was a good time to panic, she collapsed onto her bed and began to cry. She had not cried for many years, but these strange new feelings made her feel more emotional.<br />
<br />
Once her breakdown was over, she started exploring her new body. Her hair was now very long, almost going to her waist. She found she now had to constantly push it out of her face. Her chest felt strange, but groping her boobs was strangely pleasurable to her. Her right hand slowly made its way down past her waist, and her dainty fingers began to explore her new vagina. &quot;How do I work this thing?&quot; she wondered internally. She tried simply rubbing it, like one might a penis. This didn&#39;t seem to do much. This was frustrating, as she was still extremely horny; even though the pretty girl she had seen before was no longer her main focus, she felt perpetually aroused.<br />
<br />
Emily began to wonder if this transformation was permanent. What would she do? What would she tell her parents? Was there any way to turn back? And first, what was she to do next?</p>
