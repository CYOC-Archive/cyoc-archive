<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a forested area within the town limits of Moon Lake, two teenage boys were observing the setting sun as they sat on a log. Waiting for the last vestige of the daylight, both longed for the opportunity to shed their clothes and shift into their werewolf forms in the cool night air. Yet with a were-alert currently going on, neither could do that for the safety of the town. Instead they got up and headed toward the tent that they set up earlier. Stepping inside and zipping up the entrance, both looked into each other’s eyes before quickly stripping and embracing each other passionately.<br />
<br />
Growling and wrestling on the floor of the tent; they soon bulk up and grow in mass as fur covers their bodies. With tails wagging and muzzles nipping each other in a loving fashion; the two werewolves shift as they begin to orally pleasure each other in a sixty nine position. Each sucking and stroking the other’s ruby red lupine rod; growling and snarling as each other feel’s a warm flow of liquid spill forth in their toothy maws. Lapping and swallowing every salty drop as they enjoy the moment they shared with each other.<br />
<br />
“God dam,” Ben rumbling; “I needed that after the day I had.”<br />
“Tough day for you,” Alex shifting so he can stare into Ben’s wolfish eyes; “want to talk about it?”<br />
“My mom,” Ben growling; “cost me my job at Grrrrrrr. Ordering them to stay closed as long as these criminals from San-Francisco are in town. The owner was furious and told me that for the time being, he won’t be hiring any new help.”<br />
“That sucks man,” Alex letting Ben rest his chin on his shoulder; “so what are you going to do now?”<br />
“I’m not sure,” Ben sighing; “but what I do know, I can’t go home right now.”<br />
“Why is that,” Alex running his paws up and down Ben’s furry backside.<br />
“I had a big fight with my mom over it when I got home,” Ben answering; “even Frances couldn’t get us to calm down. I was so mad that I was snarling and growling at them both and wishing my mom’s ordering of the were-alert would cost her the election. And then I stormed out and hung out here waiting for you to arrive with the tent.”<br />
“You can’t stay hidden out here,” Alex answering; “you know you’ll have to go home and face the music.”<br />
“That can wait until tomorrow,” Ben looking at Alex; “but right now I want to feel you filling me up and fall asleep with your knot lodged in me.”<br />
<br />
Alex growls approvingly as he watches Ben get on all fours and moves his tail to give Alex access to his backdoor. Not wasting an opportunity, the lustful werewolf quickly mounts his eager mate and plunges right in, and starts howling as he ruts Ben into blissful unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
“Call all you want,” Frances looking at her life partner Samantha; “but if Ben doesn’t want to talk, he isn’t going to pick up the phone.”<br />
“Well what else am I going to do,” Samantha collapsing on the living room sofa; “I’ve tried to track him using that GPS trick Melissa showed us, but that didn’t work.”<br />
“That’s because it only works if the phone you are trying to ping is turned on,” Frances pointed out; “Ben obviously turned his off.”<br />
<br />
Frances stared at Samantha as she looks on despondent. Remembering the row Ben had with Samantha a few hours earlier when they all got home; Frances had to leave shortly after Ben stormed out to deal with a home invasion gone bad at the Knight Estate. Knowing she had to leave Samantha to fume and fret over her actions for the day. Actions that in the long run were the right ones to make; ordering a were-alert and issuing requests that the Were-Club and Grrrrrrr remain closed until further notice. And the final act; having KPXX and KMCL issue coded messages instructing weres that shifting into their fursonas during the Labor Day picnic is now not allowed.<br />
<br />
“Frances,” Samantha looking at her life partner; “did I go too far? Should I have let Grrrrrrr remain open?”<br />
“I’ll be honest,” Frances sitting down next to Samantha; “Ben was excited to get that job at Grrrrrrr. He did have every right to be mad at you for ordering them closed.”<br />
“But the language Ben used,” Samantha shaking her head; “he never growled like that before. It frightened me greatly.”<br />
“An angry werewolf,” Frances placing an arm around Samantha; “is never pleasant to see. But Ben would have been more scary with his language if he was in his fursona.”<br />
“Well that’s true,” Samantha nodding; “so do we go looking for our son?”<br />
“He is most likely with Alex,” Frances responding; “let him cool off. Besides,” Frances grinning; “I see an exhausted were-cat in need of some quality time with her mate.”<br />
<br />
Samantha smiles as she purrs while getting up as she allows Frances, to guide her upstairs to bed. The two removed their clothing and assume there were-cat forms. With tails thrashing and paws ruffling fur; it wasn’t long before the lesbian were-cats were each bringing the other into a state of orgasmic bliss as they knew were to touch; knew were to stroke, kiss and nibble each other’s body. Both knew what turned the other on and pleased them the most.<br />
<br />
“Promise me Frances,” Samantha sighing; “make me yowl in delight.”<br />
“Don’t I always,” Frances whispering in Samantha’s ear; using a clawed finger to lightly scratch her were-cat mate’s sex.<br />
“Oooooooh,” Samantha breathing hard; “keep up with what you are doing my love.”<br />
“I’m just getting started,” Frances burying her muzzle into Frances’s sex; using her tongue to probe Samantha’s canal. Lapping up the honey flowing from it; the rough texture rubbing up against the vaginal muscles, stimulating Samantha even further.<br />
“Ahhh yes,” Samantha purring; “keep it up, I’m getting close.”<br />
<br />
Frances doesn’t respond. She works her lover’s sex even more vigorously. Placing her paws on Samantha’s thighs as she braces herself; twirling her tongue all over the engorged and swollen vaginal lips. Frances playfully tugs at her lover’s clit, eliciting a yowl from her lover as she run her tongue up Samantha’s vagina. Frances knew Samantha was on the cusp; hearing her gasps and feeling Samantha’s paws flailing and brushing the back of her head; Frances growls as she bears down on the button standing guard to Samantha’s flower and nips at it good.<br />
<br />
Hearing Samantha yowls and smelling the sweet honey of her juices flow out; Frances’s knew she brought her partner over the edge. Purring as she lapped up more of Samantha’s sweet honey.<br />
“Oh you just know how to make me feel good,” Samantha purring; “that was magical.”<br />
“I can give you another go if you like,” Frances crawling up to embrace Samantha and lovingly lick her muzzle; “or we could just snuggle.”<br />
“Both options sound great,” Samantha returning the kiss; “but I’m content to fall asleep with you embracing me. But don’t you want to let loose and feel my touch in your intimate areas?”<br />
“I’m content to see you happy and worry free for the moment,” Frances slowly closing her eyes; “we can always pick this back up in the morning if you like.”<br />
“Expect me to wake you up,” Samantha yawning; “in the same fashion you just exhausted me into.”</p>
