<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wishing you were jacking off into Chad, Bruno?&quot; Rick asked slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Who? Sometimes I don&#39;t get you, Rick.  I don&#39;t know anyone named Chad? Do I?&quot; Rick said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
Rick just laughed and increased the rhythm of his own jacking.  The spell was working wonders, except for Rick, and maybe his Speedo, no one would think twice about Chad.  No one would go looking for him, no one would ever remember that the star quarterback had ever existed.  Or if they did, something would distract them, and out-of-sight out of mind would apply.<br />
<br />
Chad got used to Rick&#39;s twice daily jack-offs into him, and the fact that Rick wore his Speedo 24/7 or practically so. The only time Chad wasn&#39;t wrapped around the hunky swimmer, he was hanging in Rick&#39;s locker or shower at home after being washed in Rick&#39;s sink. Time became a blur.  Then one day, Chad was surprised that when Rick pulled off his jeans that he wasn&#39;t in the locker room or Rick&#39;s home, but in fact they were in his old bedroom. His trophies lined the shelves, and he saw his gym bag hanging from his dad&#39;s old exercise bike.  He wondered why that was in his room instead of in the family room?  Rick peeled Chad off his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Chad, I promised I&#39;d change you human, and I keep my word, but if you want to be my Speedo for Spring Break, call me,&quot; Rick said as he lay his still damp Speedo on the bed in Chad&#39;s room at Chad&#39;s parents&#39; house.  The cool thing about the spell was that even Chad&#39;s family hadn&#39;t missed him.  His room was dusty, and there were boxes stacked on the floor.  There was an exercise bicycle by the window.  Rick had hung his jeans, and shirt on the bicycle.  Chad looked up from the bed at the naked giant Rick looming over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I should give you a proper goodbye, Chad,&quot; Rick said jumping on the bed and grabbing Chad.  He jerked off three times, before leaving Chad under the covers.<br />
<br />
In the morning, Chad awoke with a start.  He pulled back the covers and sat up naked in his own bed.  It had to have been a dream, he sighed in relief, and lay back down. He grabbed his cock and started to jack off. Something was wrong.  He felt so horny, but his dick felt all wrong.  He peeled back the covers and stared.  His formerly cut cock was now uncut, and it was the size it had been when he was in Middle School.  He kept jerking off, and the cock hardened. As it emerged from its sheath, Chad saw writing tattooed on his penis.  &quot;RICK&#39;S LUCKY STRING.&quot;   <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, gawd!  Let me still be dreaming,&quot; Chad gasped.  He closed his eyes, and came.  He sat up.  His practically hairless crotch still sported the tiny cock and balls.  He then noticed something between his teeth, and extracted one of Rick&#39;s pubic hairs from his mouth. It wasn&#39;t a dream.<br />
<br />
He cleaned up, showered, and dressed. He looked at his reflection in the mirror.  His jeans hung funny where they had been stretched to accommodate his now absent bulge.  He grabbed some socks and stuffed his underwear until it looked right.<br />
<br />
Then he went downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad? Chad! Where have you been hiding yourself, let me get you some breakfast,&quot; Chad&#39;s mother said.  She quickly set Chad&#39;s empty place at the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Mum,&quot; Chad said sitting down.<br />
<br />
Chad looked across at his father reading the newspaper, he hadn&#39;t seemed to have heard anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, why&#39;s your exercycle in my bedroom?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
Startled, his father lowered his paper and said, &quot;Chad?&quot; as if the name was unfamiliar to him, and then he blinked and smiled, &quot;Chad, yes. My exercycle?  I thought I put it in the spare bedroom, did I put it in your room?&quot; A look of confusion crossed his face.  There was no &quot;spare bedroom.&quot;  <br />
<br />
His mother put down a tall orange juice, and a big bowl of cereal in front of Chad, then set to making eggs and toast.  <br />
<br />
Chad and his father ate in awkward silence.  Damn, Rick and his magic spells.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ll be late to school, if you don&#39;t go now,&quot; Chad&#39;s father said as  Chad sat there staring at his empty plate.  He got up and grabbed his bag and headed to school.<br />
<br />
His first class everyone acted like he had never been missing.  In his second class, Ms. Pertwee asked him, if he had missed any days of class.  Chad asked why.  She looked at her attendance book. The last two months next to Chad&#39;s name were blank.  She hadn&#39;t put a check mark for present, an A for absent or a T for tardy.  It was the only row of names that had no marks .  She said, &quot;Nevermind&quot; and proceeded to check all the blank spaces.  The rest of the day proceeded the same.<br />
<br />
At lunch, Bruno and Rick came up to his table, and planted themselves opposite him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Chad, Rick says you&#39;re going to Cancun with him for Spring Break, and I said, you&#39;d prefer to go with me to Vegas,&quot; Bruno began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hadn&#39;t really thought about it,&quot; answered Chad truthfully.<br />
<br />
He stared at Rick&#39;s grinning face.  Rick knew, but Bruno was oblivious. Rick looked different than his usual self.  He wore his usual t-shirt and letterman&#39;s jacket, but now he wore a necklace. Chad kept stating a the necklace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruno, you said you had some info about Vegas to that would convince Chad, where is it?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just want me to leave you alone with golden boy, so you can talk him into Cancun!&quot; Bruno challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Rick said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
The banter went on, but Chad tuned out most of it. Finally, Bruno left.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Chad, the man, ready to be my Speedo next week.  Bet you missed my junk inside you,&quot; Rick said, &quot;You know if you go with me to Cancun, I&#39;ll guarantee to make it worth your while, Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked Chad pointedly,<br />
<br />
Rick played with his necklace.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot to take my lucky drawstring before I changed you back,&quot; Rick confessed.  &quot;I want it back. So I need you to consent to be my Speedo again, and I&#39;ll take my drawstring, before changing you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s my old drawstring?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
Rick rolled his eyes, &quot;You cannot blame me for wanting to keep a trophy, I put a bead for each meet I won on it, and made it into this necklace,&quot; he said untying it and showing Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, how will you make Cancun worth my while?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll only wear you only a third the time.  On the flight each way, and you can enjoy the beach as a human, and work on your tan the rest of the time.  We&#39;ll have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but you have to put my drawstring back in me as soon as you transform me into a Speedo, and you have to make sure it&#39;s there when you change me back.  Understand?  And I get to enjoy the sun on the beach at Cancun as a human - so you will bring my suit and clothes with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, here&#39;s the stuff on Vegas-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late, Bruno. Chad&#39;s agreed to go to Cancun, pay up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick and Bruno and there stupid bets.</p>
