<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kellie entered Katie’s house she could see the girls and Aunt Lisa busily getting dinner ready. Claudia had arranged for Mike to pick Samantha up later that evening for dinner and a movie. Afterwards Samantha was going to be dropped off back at Katie’s where the girls would be spending the night. Now everyone was hustling through the house looking to find the perfect outfit for Samantha’s date. Katie saw Kellie as she entered the house. “Hey How was babysitting?”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she dug the $40 out of her pocket. “I made $40 and had a little bit of fun,” she said with a smile. A look of concern spread over Katie’s face as she gazed at her girlfriends impish smile. “Uh oh what kind of fun?” She asked. Before Kellie could answer the doorbell rang. “I think your about to find out,” she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Katie watched as Lisa curiously made her way to the door. Mike wasn’t expected to show up for at least a couple of hours and she wasn’t expecting visitors. Katie watched as Lisa opened the door, an audible gasp passing over her lips. Alarmed the girls made their way towards the front door to see what had happened. The girls now joined Lisa in releasing gasps of their own. “Holy shit,” Claudia whispered.<br />
<br />
Jason and Gloria now stood in the doorway smiling. “Hi Lisa,” he said. “Sorry to bug you. Kellie accidentally left her cellphone at my place. I heard she was spending the night here so I thought I’d save her the trip.”<br />
<br />
Lisa flushed as she stared up at Jason. Katie could see her aunt actually trying to find words as she gazed at Jason. “Oh um thanks so much,” she whispered her cheeks flushing. Gloria rushed past both adults as she handed the phone back to Kellie. “My dad wanted to deliver this himself,” she whispered to Kellie. “I told him I could do it myself but he insisted.” Kellie smiled as she took her phone back, placing it in her back pocket. Turning she could see both Mika and Claudia gaping at the handsome man in front of them. <br />
<br />
“Kellie,” Claudia whispered. “Who is that?” Kellie smiled and shrugged. “Oh that’s Mr. Turner, I babysit for him all the time.” Claudia and Mika now excitedly began talking.<br />
<br />
“He looks like Hugh Jackman,” Claudia exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Is he single?” Mika inquired.<br />
<br />
“Does he have a younger brother?”<br />
<br />
Kellie giggled as she listened to the girls pepper her with questions. Turning she could see Katie gaping at Jason. “Katie,” she giggled. “Your jaw is hanging.” Gently she placed her fingers under Katie’s mouth and closed it for the bewildered girl. Katie turned and stared dumbfounded at her girlfriend. Kellie just smiled as she gestured towards where Lisa and Jason were talking.<br />
<br />
Katie watched intently as Lisa and Jason engaged in small talk. For the first time in her life Katie could see that her aunt appeared flummoxed by a handsome man. Usually Lisa was unwaveringly confident when it came to talking with men. In this case she seemed to struggle with words, acting more like a smitten school girl then confident fitness model.<br />
<br />
“So Lisa,” Jason asked. “I was just wondering if you would like to get a cup of coffee sometime.” Lisa still in awe of Jason’s presence nodded her head drunkenly before responding with a simple uh huh. “Wow really,” he exclaimed surprised she accepted. “That’s great!” Jason cleared his throat before answering. Katie could see he too was somewhat intimidated by her attractive aunt. “I mean cool. Maybe tomorrow morning?” Lisa shook her head as if coming out of a daze. “What oh yeah, yeah,” she said quickly. “Tomorrow morning sounds great, say 10 a.m.” <br />
<br />
“Great it’s a date them,” he smiled. Both Lisa and Jason now flushed red as they realized what had just happened. “So I better get going,” he said meekly. “I still need to finish diner and I’m sure you have plans tonight too.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I need to finish up here too,” Lisa stated still gazing at Jason. “But tomorrow sounds like fun.”<br />
<br />
Both adults now gazed awkwardly at each other as if trying to figure out what to say next. “Come on dad,” Gloria giggled. “You got your date now let’s go finish dinner. Good to see you again Ms. O’Toole. Bye Kellie I’ll see you tomorrow.” Both adults turned a deeper shade of red as they waved goodbye. Lisa closed the door slowly. Leaning against the door now she sighed and placed her hand across her chest.<br />
<br />
“What happened?” Katie asked with concern. Lisa looked at her niece with a confused look on her face. “I guess I just made a date.”she said breathlessly. Before Katie could say anything Claudia and Mika raced past her. “Omg he is so hot,” Claudia exclaimed. “I am so coming over here all summer,” Mika sighed. Lisa looked over at the two excited teens and smiled. “Yes he is very attractive,” she said. “But that’s only part of what makes him so attractive.”<br />
<br />
“Well tell us,” Mary Elise exclaimed. Lisa sighed as she thought of Jason. “Well he’s also a successful architect, a loving single father, he’s very responsible,” she gushed fanning herself. “ He’s very kind, funny and has an easy going personality.”<br />
<br />
“Plus he’s hot,” Claudia sighed. “Katie do you have any idea how hot your neighbor is?”<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head as the girls now talked in an animated fashion about Jason. Lisa sighed as she tried to compose herself. She had known Jason for years yet it seemed like only now was she truely  taken  by his ruggedly handsome appearance. As she tried to regain her composure she noticed Samantha approach. “You okay Ms. Lisa?” The teen asked.<br />
<br />
Lisa breathed deeply and smiled. “Yeah I’m okay,” she said. “Just nervous about our date is all I guess.”<br />
<br />
“Weren’t you telling me that the best way to be on a date is just to be yourself.”<br />
<br />
Lisa looked at Samantha and smirked. “You give pretty good advise their Sammy,” she grinned. Sammy blushed slightly as she grinned. “I had a pretty smart woman give me excellent advise.”<br />
<br />
Katie stared dumbfounded as the her aunt and their friends now talked happily about both Samantha and Lisa’s dates. Turning towards Kellie she could see a smug grin spread across her face. “Am I good or am I good,” she grinned handing the ring back to Katie. Katie smirked and placed a small kiss on her Kellies lips. “Well Kel,” she said. “You definitely know how to make things interesting.”</p>
