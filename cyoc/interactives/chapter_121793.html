<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen woke up to her alarm clock obnoxiously blaring and reminding her it was a school day.  Raising her arms up from under the covers, she confirmed that what she remembered from last night had really happened - there were 4 arms up in the air.<br />
<br />
Inspecting her arms closer, she noticed that her lower pair of arms was now indistinguishable from her upper pair.  During the night, the &quot;borrowed&quot; arms had grown slightly, and changed skin tone to match her body exactly.<br />
<br />
She got out of bed and pulled on her nightclothes.  The sticky clothes came off, emphasizing that Jennifer needed a shower before she could be properly presentable to the world again.<br />
<br />
Grabbing a towel, Jen covered herself and walked down the hall to the bathroom, only to discover it was closed and locked.  Steam escaped under the door, and she could hear the shower behind the door.  Jen banged on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I need to take a shower.  Don&#39;t use all the hot water!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay.  I just got in here.  Give me 20 minutes.&quot;  Cassie yelled back.<br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed and admitted defeat.  Cassie had a history of being unrushable when in the shower.  Faced with the fact that she wasn&#39;t going to be able to shower before breakfast, Jen decided to reverse the usual order this morning and rushed back to her room to find her robe.  The defeat left Jen feeling cranky.<br />
<br />
Pulling the robe out of the closet, she was surprised to see it had 4 sleeves.  The curse had adjusted her clothing to account for the arms she had purloined from her sister late last night; an interesting development.  Remembering an incident a couple years ago when Jen had worn only her robe to breakfast one morning, and it had slid off leaving her completely in the nude in front of her younger sister and both parents, Jen decided to put on some underwear too.<br />
<br />
Looking in her armoire, she found all her bras now had 3 cups.  She grabbed one and slipped it on, over her top pair of arms, and between her top and bottom pair of arms.  With her lower arms she adjusted her 3 breasts and sneaked in a quick grope, momentarily enjoying the sensation.  It made Jen feel a little better, but she was still cranky her younger sister was hogging the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Her panties drawer looked the same as always. Quickly slipping on a pair of panties confirmed that nothing had changed about them.  Jen then donned her robe and walked past the locked and steamy bathroom to the stairwell.<br />
<br />
Partway down the stairs, Jen noticed out the window that both her parent&#39;s cars were gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and Dad must have left early.  Ugh, workaholics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the kitchen, Jen was annoyed to see Cassie sitting at the table eating breakfast.  Clearly Cassie had already showered: She was wearing her school clothes, and her hair was moist as though she had recently gotten out of the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?!  You... bathroom hog!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  I haff as muff wight fo the baffroom as you!&quot;  Cassie managed past her mouth full of cereal.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re wasting all the hot water too!  Ugh, Cassie, you&#39;re awful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie swallowed just in time to respond, &quot;No I&#39;m not. Just wait, I&#39;ll be done soon.  Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m showering now.  You can shower later.&quot;  Jen turned around and stormed back upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you can&#39;t!  I&#39;m using the shower right now!&quot;  Cassie called back.  Jen ignored her, not in any mood to buy into Cassie&#39;s obvious prank.<br />
<br />
Upstairs at the bathroom door, Jen could hear movement on the other side of the door.  Jen banged on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know who you are, but get out of there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t come in!&quot; It sounded like Cassie calling from the other side of the door.  Taken aback by how the voice sounded exactly like her sister down in the kitchen, Jen paused for a moment to reconsider the possibility that something might be going on.  Then she remembered her disgustingly sticky legs and pushed past her hesitation.<br />
<br />
Jennifer grabbed the skeleton key they kept on top of the door for emergencies and used it to forcibly open the lock.<br />
<br />
&quot;aHA!&quot;  Jen shoved the door open, pointing forward at... Cassie, her sister, completely drenched with shampoo still in her hair and wearing nothing but a hastily wrapped towel around her torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit Jen, I told you I was in the shower!  Don&#39;t barge in on me!&quot;  Cassie snapped at Jen, clearly angry that she had to abort her shower partway through.<br />
<br />
Jen stared dumbfounded at her sister in front of her.  Cassie had been downstairs eating breakfast... How had she both beaten Jen up the stairs, and gotten into the bathroom?<br />
<br />
A voice from the stairs quickly answered that question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I was using the shower.&quot;  Cassie&#39;s voice rang out from the stairs.  Jen spun around to see another Cassie standing halfway up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just like when I was 6 and you didn&#39;t believe I had to use the toilet and barged in!&quot;  Cassie on the stairs glared at Jen.<br />
<br />
From behind, the Cassie in the bathroom spoke again, &quot;Or that prank you pulled on me in gym class when I was a freshman.&quot;  Jen spun around to stare at the soaked Cassie again.<br />
<br />
Jen looked back and forth, staring at the Cassie on the stairs, then the Cassie in the bathroom, then back to the Cassie on the stairs.  The expressions on both Cassie&#39;s faces quickly crept into mischievous grins.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?!?&quot;  Jen screamed once she regained the ability to speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cassie on the stairs climbed up the rest of the stairs, and pushed past Jen into the bathroom.  Both Cassies stood next to each other, and both looked at Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, right?&quot; the Cassie on the left said.<br />
<br />
Without missing a beat, the right Cassie said &quot;I had the idea in a dream last night.  What if I made an extra copy of every part of my body...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...and then assembled them together with none touching my original body?&quot; left Cassie finished.<br />
<br />
Jen suddenly understood.  Both of the girls were Cassie - she had managed to duplicate herself using her new powers of creating extras, and detaching/reattaching parts.  Both copies of Cassie seemed to have all the memories and personality of Cassie, but most impressively, they seemed linked up in a way that implied they were a single consciousness controlling both Cassies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.  But... why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Cassies shrugged simultaneously, &quot;It seemed like a cool idea.&quot; &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I?&quot; both Cassies spoke different sentences.  &quot;Oops&quot; both said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Cassies glanced inward, making eye contact with each other, then looked back at Jenn.  The left Cassie spoke, &quot;I&#39;m still new to this.  Only been like this for about an hour.&quot;  Right Cassie took over speaking, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure I have 2 brains now too, and sometimes I speak too fast before I consider if my other brain is going to talk.&quot;  Left Cassie finished, &quot;Pretty cool problem to have.  I&#39;m too smart!  Haha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen sighed.  &quot;Well if you&#39;re both Cassie, then that means one of you has already showered.  So can I pleaaaase take my shower now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Cassies giggled.  Right Cassie, the Cassie already dressed in her school clothes, responded, &quot;Sure!  Only one of me needs to go to school anyway, and I&#39;m already ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then get out of here!  You weirdo.  Weirdos?  However many of you there are... get out!&quot;  Jen grabbed one Cassie by the wrist and pulled her out of the bathroom.  The other quickly left the bathroom to escape Jen&#39;s imminent rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine fine.  Have a good shower, there&#39;s still plenty of hot water left!&quot; the Cassies echoed.  Jen slammed the door shut and quickly stripped down.  Outside the door, she could hear the two Cassies laughing at the successful prank.  Or rather, her 1 sister in two bodies.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer stepped into the lukewarm shower, she couldn&#39;t help but think about what it would be like to have two bodies.  Cassie had mentioned that only 1 of her needed to go to school, so the other one could do whatever she wanted all day.. a tantalizing prospect.<br />
<br />
One short and nearly cold shower later, Jen stepped out of the shower and...</p>
