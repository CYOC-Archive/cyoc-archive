<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex looked at Ty, his eyes bright and smiling.  &quot;Ty, I can't believe it.  This is too good to be true!&quot;  His face moved between his body, which had the beginnings of a hairy beefy chest, to his goatee, which though wispy and sparse, promised of greater things.  &quot;This is awesome&quot; he sighs, as he rubs his hairy nipples.<br />
Ty looks at his friend and asks, &quot;I'm glad you like it, but what about tomorrow's swim meet?&quot;  <br />
Alex turned, his face pale.  &quot;I forgot.  I can't look like this there!  Hell, I can't go home like this!!&quot;  His newly rounded face flushed again, and his eyes teared up.  &quot;It's not fair.  I would quit that team if I could keep looking like this&quot; He says, his voice cracking and tight.<br />
Ty consoles his friend, rubbing his back.  &quot;It'll be all right.&quot; Ty says soothingly.  &quot;I'll fix it all, just you go home, and go to sleep.  Tomorrow it'll feel like a brand new world.&quot;  He patted Alex's back, and Alex turned his chubby goateed face toward Ty.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Alex asks, uncertain.<br />
&quot;Really.  Your parents won't say anything, and the swim meet will be a thing of the past.&quot;  Ty replied, and in his mind, he thought out what was needed.  <br />
&quot;Well, all right&quot; Alex answers and gathers his things.  He puts on a gym shirt that now stretches over his belly and exposes the new hairs on his chest.  He grins as he feels the taut shirt around his belly.  &quot;Guess I won't need to work out, eh?&quot; Alex laughs.<br />
&quot;Only if you want.  Personally I think you should build big muscles and a big gut!&quot; Ty replies his grin spread widely.  <br />
Alex blushes and nods.  &quot;Cool, then I'll keep using the bench at home.&quot;  He picks his bag and heads to the door of Ty's room.  &quot;I'll see you in school, Ty&quot; He waves and heads home.<br />
Ty smiles, as his fattened friend bikes down the street.  'I'll definitely be seeing more of you' Ty thinks.  'I wish that Alex would continue to get a little hairier, a little bigger and a little taller each day.  And I wish that every time he saw a bear he fancies doing something, that he would be tempted and would, eventually, try it.' Ty sighs.  He feels the tingle of a wish completed, and he heads to his room, looking for some clothes to wear.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alex rides home.  He's so excited that he doesn't feel the small buzz as Ty's wish comes true.  He feel the taut shirt rustle around his body a little more closer than before.  He slows down as he turns into his house.  Across the hedge next to his driveway, his neighbor, Mr. Tonsor, calls out.  <br />
&quot;Hey Alex, Have a good ride?&quot; He says, through the thick hedge.<br />
&quot;Sure did, Mr. Tonsor.&quot; Alex replies.  He feels a blush coming.  Mr. Tonsor was a huge muscle bear.  He competed in last month's  State bodybuilding contest and won 2nd place.  Alex hears him turn around the hedge. <br />
&quot;That's good.  Would you do something for me?&quot; Mr. Tonsor asks.  He stands a good 8 inches taller than Alex and outweighs him by almost 90lbs.  He has a nice thick beard, one Alex has always admired.  Mr. Tonsor removes a thick 9 inch cigar from his mouth, exhaling a thin stream of blue smoke.  Though he tries to blow it away from Alex, the wind changes and blows it into Alex's face.  &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, Alex.  I didn't' mean to do that&quot; <br />
Alex, trying to hide a raging hard-on, smiles &quot;Not a problem, Mr. Tonsor.  What did you need me to do?&quot; he replies.  As the smoke continues to drift to him, Alex inhales deeply of it.  It has a sharp pungent smell, and Alex is starting to like it.  <br />
Mr. Tonsor smiles and puts the cigar back in his mouth.  &quot;Good, I need you to give this to your parents.&quot; He says, as he hands Alex an envelope.  &quot;It's my contribution to the charity event next month.  The guys at the gym and I raised a good bit to help those people, so if you'd be a good man and give it to them, I'd really appreciate it.&quot;  <br />
The envelope is thick, and as Alex peaks inside, he sees hundreds of hundred dollar bills.  &quot;Wow,  Okay, Mr. Tonsor, won't be a problem&quot;  He say, tucking the envelope in his tight front pocket.  <br />
Mr. Tonsor smiles back, &quot;Knew you were a good man.  Thanks.  Oh, by the way, your goatee's coming in great!&quot; He turns and walks back across the hedge, leaving Alex in a cloud of blue smoke.  <br />
Alex trembles, inhaling the smoke with a passion, and he turns and heads back to the house.  Midway there, he adjusts himself so his rock hard dick is a little more comfy.  <br />
Inside, he sets the envelope down on the counter.  He writes a note, telling his mom that it's from Mr. Tonsor.  He sets it aside and runs up to his room.  There, he looks at himself in the mirror.  'Oh, this is the best' Alex thinks as he re-examines his hefty body.  He goes over to the scale, and it pops up 216.  His boner pops up, and Alex disappears in the bathroom.  <br />
He comes back a bit sweaty, but smiling.  'Alex, you're looking quite the hot man.' he thinks, and a warm breeze flows across him.  The twilight sky goes violet, and Alex spots his neighbor, smoking his cigar in the backyard.  Alex closes his window, after catching a whiff of the cigar again, and, because he promised Ty, he went straight to bed.  Alex un-dressed and decided not to put on his PJ's, instead opting for just his tight boxers.  He hopped in his bed, and with the first touch of his head to the pillow, he was out like a light.  Only the breeze and the smell of cigar remained stirring in the room.  <br />
<br />
Back at Ty's room, Ty watched his friend and chuckled.  This was promising to be a most interesting adventure</p>
