<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke was the typical little brother, with the knack for being able to wreak havoc by simply appearing in a room and the remarkable ability to make even the simplest things more difficult by just being there. When he had come running through the kitchen he, or maybe one of his friends had bumped into Tiff, nearly knocking her over, which was why she had put the microscope down harder than intended. Her reasons for exclaiming were two-fold, her first concern was that she might have broken her microscope, which despite its poor quality was the best she could afford, the other reason was just as alarming. She had smashed one of the fruits when she put the microscope down, resulting in a spray of juice and pulp. Most of the juice pooled harmlessly on the counter top, but some had sprayed up and gotten on her. Even more troubling was that a large piece of pulp had landed in her open mouth just as she was about to tell her brother and his friends to play outside.<br />
<br />
She made a little choking sound as she nearly inhaled the pulp while trying to speak. Swallowing painfully she realized what had happened, that she had been exposed. All sorts of things went through her mind, whether or not such a small bit of fruit would have any effect, whether it was the process of digestion that activated the fruits' qualities, and more importantly, how the fruit was absorbed into the body. If it needed to be activated by digestive enzymes there was less to worry about, the same applied if contact with mucus membranes was needed for the chemicals to be absorbed. If skin contact was enough she was in a bit more trouble.<br />
<br />
Her brother and his friends froze at the look on her face, knowing that they might be in trouble. Instead Tiff was surprisingly calm, &quot;Guys, please go play somewhere else. This mess is potentially hazardous and I don't want to risk anyone being exposed to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Members of her family were accustomed to her experiments so her little brother nodded and took his friends to another room to play.<br />
<br />
With one thing taken care of Tiff turned to see exactly what sort of fruit she had been exposed to. As she expected, it had been a yellow penis fruit. She had taken more of them than the others since it was that sort of fruit that she had given to Katie. She wanted to wash herself off, but she already knew the risks and didn't want to leave something so potentially dangerous lying around in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
After washing her hands she went and got several plastic bags and two brand new sponges. She double-bagged the smashed fruit before using one of the sponges to clean up the juice. She bagged the sponge too before covering the second in soap and throughly cleaning the counter. This sponge was also bagged, to be disposed of as hazardous waste when she went to school the next day.<br />
<br />
The undamaged fruits were put in another bag so that when she was done she could put them in the little refrigerator in her room, one that her parents had bought for her a few years ago so she could store chemicals that needed to be kept cool without having them near food.<br />
<br />
She throughly scrubbed all the counter tops and the floor before she went up to her room and put the clothes she had been wearing in a final bag. At this point she wasn't going to be taking any chances. Finally she went into the bathroom and turned on the shower, just as a tingling was starting in her crotch. It might have been fear, making her feel that things were happening to her even if they weren't, but a more scientific part of her mind was reminding her how much faster Katie had felt the effects of the fruit. Delayed onset could be a good sign, one meaning a lesser degree of change. She sure hoped that was the case.<br />
<br />
When the water was warm enough she stepped into the shower and began to examine herself. There were no visible changes between her legs so she quickly began to wash herself, hoping that it wasn't too late.<br />
<br />
The tingling kept up, growing in intensity to a dull pins and needles sort of feeling, not uncomfortable, just sort of like the way it felt when one of her feet fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Parting her fine pubic hair to get a better look she saw that her clit had changed shape slightly. It was a little thicker and maybe a bit longer, but so far nothing like what had happened to Katie.<br />
<br />
Trying not to pay attention to the change she went back to washing herself, wanting to be sure that every trace of the fruit juice was gone from her, then she'd stop to see what it had done to her.<br />
<br />
Three rinses later she ran out of hot water.<br />
<br />
Deciding that there was nothing more she could do she got out of the shower and sat down on the toilet lid. The tingling had stopped, convincing her that it was over and she did feel different down between her legs, though after the first inspection she had resisted the urge to look again.<br />
<br />
This time the change was more obvious.<br />
<br />
Her clit had grown to be about the size of her thumb and had come forward ever so slightly, but that might have been an illusion based on its larger size. To test this she stood up to see how it looked. It came as a relief to see that it was in the same place as always, just more noticeable because of its size.<br />
<br />
Taking it gently between her thumb and first finger she shuddered. It was much more sensitive than it had been before, but that was understandable. From what she had heard guys were far more sensitive than girls and her clit had become a perfectly formed, perfectly proportioned miniature penis.</p>
