<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Manson family was in a host or worries for their missing two sons. The news went everywhere, it coming to the notice of television news as they sent two news investigators to ask questions and look for any possible witness. As such it seemed the boys just vanished, as after nearly a full year of rumors, neither were found either alive or as dead.<br />
<br />
Both Tye and Phillip knew where they were as alive and taking each day as another of their living like, while being as donkeys and animals. Although Dave did not fully treat the brothers as if they were ignorant beasts, because they retained their smarts, as knew better their position. Standing on all fours a human mentality tends to gain considerable knowledge as to what life becomes as kin being big male animals.<br />
<br />
The brothers had become as mature stud donkeys, and due to the longer length of their hind feet, they gained as well longer male members, though black of color, their cocks were primal of shapes, and the distal head of their cocks bloomed larger, as Dave would chuckle when seeing a cock hung erect, he thought the head reminded him of a toilet plunger.<br />
<br />
Phillip seemed to accept his being a male donkey and changed his style of hygiene to match his beastly lifestyle. Maybe Dave noted the change as different from his elder brother struggling to retain his sense of self; so Dave loaned Phil to another farm as a sire-stud.<br />
<br />
Phil being five years younger than was Tye, when the new to being a donkey saw his first jennet donkey standing with her winking vulva as beckoning of him to mate, he became wildly ensensed with male desires. At the moment his massive cock touched the wet, hot lips of equine sex, what was a well reared teenager changed into a brute male animal wanting to procreate his species.<br />
<br />
Mr. Don Branson told Dave about the first breeding session as to how the Jack male named Philly caused his jennet mate to breed from her vulva. Although after a day at the farm, Philly changed his style of breeding and went at it with two mares as might a respectable equine gentleman. Mr. Branson laughed with Dave as he told of how Philly mounted a mare, thrust inside, and then began slow, as seemingly enjoyable fun mating, stood mounted and thrusting for half an hour before reluctantly dismounting his mare.<br />
<br />
Odd as well, the mated mare returned her favoring of Philly be her licking his cock clean, doing so as if his cock her her just dropped foal. Philly stood with his cock hung fully erect, he accepting the generous favoring of the mare licking him clean. Philly in turn then sniffed his way back to the mare rump, as he took to lick cleaning of the mare vulva, as she urinated on his muzzle, and started him to mate with her a second time. As after another thirty minutes of slow thrusting, they parted and began all over their mutual appreciations.<br />
<br />
Mr. Branson had a lot to say about Philly, and made mention of him to other breeder, as made a list of farm owners wanting Philly to come and breed at their farms.<br />
<br />
Dave was delighted and foolishly placed an advertisement in the Farm Bureau monthly, what drew then an unexpected visitor. Dave was just finished with eating his lunch when he took note of a young teenage girl, she acting as sneaking to look around outside his barn. He watched her as she acted as if inspecting while not wishing to her being noticed, she dashing in quick sprints from place to place, while peering around corners or through open doors.<br />
<br />
A loud bray of Tye recognizing the girl suggested she was a sneak. Dave disliked sneaky people and for some he had his way of giving them a drastic realization as what farm lifestyle was like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there big boy, it just little ole&#39; me, and I won&#39;t hurt you..., holy crap, you got a huge cock. Wow, I have seen pony and horse cocks before, but you, you are the biggest donkey with a near fencepost for your cock!&quot; Shesaid, as talking to herself and using her soft tone of voice to keep the huge male animal as quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are quite correct, my stud donkey has a long and large cock; so is he why you are sneaking around outside as inside my barn?&quot; An angry sounding farmer Dave boldly asked his trespasser of her intentions.<br />
<br />
Obviously caught, &quot;I am Darla, Darla Manson, and my two brothers went as missing after they drove off the road and into your field.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and not quite right, as your brothers about midnight drove off the road and drove circles through my matured Alfalfa field, making a mess before they got stuck. The next morning I made use of my two Mammoth Donkeys to pull the truck out of the field and back onto the road where the Sheriff took and impounded it. That is what actually happened, so what did you expect to find here inside my barn?&quot; Dave said, he asking her to tell what she thought.<br />
<br />
Darla whirled around to her facing Dave as she answered, &quot;I might expect to find some item, or maybe an entity, or mentality still of my brothers. <br />
<br />
I was at church the other Sunday and spoke with Doc Feenstra, the Veterinarian. He in talking with me made reference to Mr. Branson another farm owner who borrowed a large stud donkey for breeding. Mr. Branson requested the Vet to give a medical check and take a semen sample. The donkey was a loaner from your farm and its name is Philly, now isn&#39;t that odd!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you think is foolishness, but I purchased Philly from a breeding farm. Philly is but a two year old, as big as he will get, but well able to breed.&quot; Dave replied, as Darla turned and strolled to the stall where stood another large male donkey, as it looked to acting anxious, his cock by then being fully erect, the brute lifting it to bumping his rounded furry belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he new to your farm as well,&quot; Darla said as she used her right handed thumb to point at the nervous donkey. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he arrived recently, as is five years older than is Philly, but untried as a breeder, he works well with the younger donkey when put as a team.&quot; Dave replied, as he too was getting a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that seems logical, ah what is this horny fellow&#39;s name?&quot; Darla asked as she leaned over the stall rail to see then the big stud ejaculate three mighty spewed streams of semen, some landing onto his forelegs and the stall floor bedding.<br />
<br />
Dave sighed, and said, &quot;Tyson, the big horny stud is named Tyson!&quot;</p>
