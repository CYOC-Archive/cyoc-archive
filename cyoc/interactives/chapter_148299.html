<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An add plopped up just as you wanted to close your browser. It wouldn´t be bad if it would be without sound, or rather someones talking. “Headache problems? Feeling like you have grown two additional heads on your....” You had closed the add and the browser now, but again the damage was done and you curse your luck. <br />
With ease the latex crawls up your arm, vanishing under your shirt. You couldn´t see, but feel it splitting into two blobs of latex, one half staying on your left shoulder while the second half moved over to your right one. Then both blobs started to grew bigger, straining your shirt until it ripped open around your shoulders, giving room for the two growing heads right next to the original one. They looked like your original head, only without the horn, the antlers and the tusks.<br />
“Great, how do I explain something like that. At least they look normal.” You said from your original mouth. You sigh, you will need someone to help you, someone you trust not to take advantage of your problem.<br />
While you think about who to trust the heads fill out, and after half an hour pondering who to turn to, the heads had finished and you regained the latex glove. You quickly got a headache from the different views and with some effort got the eyes on your new heads closed.<br />
<br />
While you try to find someone, an email arrives for you. Seeing its your friend Anne you open it, only to find a recorded voicemail as an attachment to it. Knowing she does so every time there is more than a couple of words to say, you open the file. Seeing that your computer is buffering it up a bit you put the volume up a bit to hear it across the rooms. Then you stand up and slowly walk over to the kitchen for something to drink. <br />
One look in the mirror near the door and you laugh, sounding hollow and down. “I look ridiculous.” You state, and it echoed from your other heads as well. It took a bit to get your antlers through the door-frame without hitting one of the other heads, but you get a glass and fill it with water at the sink. The moment you start to drink your computer is finished buffering up. “That thing is slow as hell sometimes.” you think irritated.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jake, I hope you have gotten your costume for the party tomorrow.” Anne started. You let the glass sink, you had forgotten about that party. It was a costume party at your friend Mikes house for his birthday.<br />
“I got my bright red cat ears today, and Chris got his bright neon-green lion mane finally.” She continued. The glass slipped from your hand and broke on the ground. Of course she must start off saying what the groups costumes are. You start to panic, already feeling the latex move again. You run over to the door, knocking something over near the door while you try to get through. Just your luck that you forget your antlers, getting stuck in the frame, just as the object toppled over against the kitchen door. The door close a bit before stopping through your already stuck antlers. You can´t reach the object from your place in the door, pushing the door open again doesn´t work because its blocked by the object and your antlers are stuck halfway, so you can neither go forward into the living room nor back up into the kitchen. You are completely stuck now, and with of your original ears already covered by the latex and moving up forming triangular cat ears next to your antlers you are unable to block the sound from them, let alone the other two heads. The latex encases the frame of your original head, the lion mane already forming.<br />
While you try to push that damn door open again Anne&#39;s voice continued. “Mike got that cool wolf muzzle complete with sharp wolf fangs and a authentic wolfs howl to show off. Peter got a bit lame with his pink pig nose, but we will see what else he got.”<br />
You cry in panic as the latex covers your face more, blocking you from breathing shortly. It forms a muzzle out of your nose and mouth, even when the nose is a pig one above the canine muzzle. “Oh just stop explaining the costumes, Anne. You are not helping mooooowww. Wooooowww, NOOOOWWWW” Your cry changed mid-sentence into a wolf-like howl, taking your voice there away, letting you howl and yelp. The other heads had continued normal with “... me. What, noo.” At least your not completely without the ability of talking. But maybe you should write your problems down or typing it if you loose it later. But first you must get those damn antlers out of the door-frame, hopefully Anne is done with hear comments.<br />
<br />
But no such luck for you. “June got that pair of extra arms for her costume and  asked David if he should switch it to crab pinchers instead of hands. He himself got a centaur lower half to wear. Nico has thick elephant feet that are kinda heavy to lift, he won´t move around much. And Dudley has said he doesn´t like his horse hooves for hands in his costume.”<br />
You yowl again in terror when the latex crawls down your arms and encases your hands, forming them into hooves. That way both typing and writing are impossible. The latex then starts to push your shirt until with two ripping noises the extra arms push through, looking human until the pinchers form in the end. Not much help with your problems now. Another ripping sound has your feet burst out of your shoes and socks, getting thicker and heavier. Then the latex pushes your legs back, with shreds your jeans, and you gain a pair of additional legs, also ending in thick elephant feet. You will look like a monster if this continued. Was it coincidence that just after you got that damn glove all that has to happen. But it wasn´t over yet.<br />
<br />
“Harry wanted to hide his big donkey cock in a dog sheath to not embarrass himself to much, but it didn´t really fit in. At least not with his big bull balls down there.  Susan has finished modeling her cow udder some days ago and Lilian got that orange kangaroo pouch she needed. Did you know that Ben has gotten an expandable frog tongue for his frog mouth? Oh, James was so envious of him, as he only got a foldable giraffe neck, looking like a accordion on him. He has lost his bet about cubes, didn´t think he would roll snack eyes there.”<br />
You just want this disaster to end when the latex crawled around again. You yelped and then moaned when it covered your cock, making it bigger. Your balls also grow bigger, leaving you with a much to big package down there. And then it all was sucked back into your new sheath, the pressure was painful. You finally move in the door, but only to sink to your knees from the pain. <br />
A bit more to the center of your centaur like lower half a new weight added itself to you, forming an heavy udder. In your kneeing position it nearly touched the ground. The pouch grew out right where your new behind connected, leaving it with an opening skywards. At least one thing that could be useful. It ended just under your really strained and ripped shirt. How that was still intact with the holes for the extra heads and arms was questionable. Then all of the sudden the neck of your original head expanded, which resulted in you hitting the door-frame with your head. In your dizziness you didn´t notice the crawling latex until it jumps into your open eyes, blinding your right head. On the same head the latex covered the mouth, removing the teeth and thinning the tongue while expanding the skin of your cheeks. <br />
“That&#39;s enough Anne, please.” screamed your left head, while your original one howled and your right one croaks loudly. Not that she could hear you, it was a voicemail after all. <br />
<br />
”Than there is Rick who got a triceratops horns for his nose and head from his uncle, Tommy bought glasses that look like fly eyes from the outside and Lisa showed me her new pink bunny ears together with peacock feathers to cover her head. She also got a red neck-covering cloth from her mother that fits so nicely.”<br />
You still hope this all is just a nightmare. The latex from the frog mouth on your right head quickly covers your head there, forming a horn on your nose and additional ones in the sports where your original head had his antlers now. Next to them sprout fluffy bunny ears into the air before the rest is covered in the growing feathers of a bird, you recall that of a peacock. The latex runs down your right heads neck again, only to leave the skin in a blood red color.<br />
At the same time on your original head the latex that is still there splits up and flows down into your eyes, making you cry in pain, you hadn´t closed them fast enough. Through the eyes on your left head you see that you are nearly cover completely in latex, leaving only a couple of places free of it. Mostly your left head, your arms and legs as well as your back and chest are still free.<br />
<br />
“Luna has gotten some fake white dragon claws and a pair of red dragon wings for her back, she will look majestic. Aidan got himself a dark green turtle shell for his back and Jeremy himself various tails, lets see, a rat tail, a green saurian tail, a cow tail and a small pink pig tail. We will see as what he comes tomorrow.”<br />
You yowl and croak again as the latex around your cock splits and moves up to your ass. There it split into four different tails, surrounding the fox tail you already have there. Underneath grows a thick saurian like tail, you can´t say what kind of saurian. To the left grew a long, naked rat tail, looking much thinner than the saurian one. To the right a short tail grows with a tuft of fur in the end and above the fox tail grows a small, spiral shaped pig tail. <br />
Because to neither hooves nor pinchers are suited for claws they just grew out of your big elephant feet nails. But with no individual toes they are just an inflexible addition to them. Then the latex covers your upper back completely before bulging out into a hard shell, shredding your shirt finally. Beside the latex you are now naked. On the upper part of your vertical back something grew out of the building shell. The wings got bigger and bigger there, but you realize to late that they will only add to you being stuck as with them you won´t fit through the door anymore, at least not before you can fold them away.<br />
<br />
“Erik got a sharp eagle beak for himself, including the option to let an eagles cry loose. Rachel will go as a living plant, a big sunflower frame to her face with a green neck covered with leafs. Chad got bull horns for his head and gave Nico some fake elephant ears and tusks and some cat eyes for me.“<br />
Slowly you don´t believe that all this was going by chance. It was ridiculous that not one time a bodypart was called a second time, safe for it existing double or made so.<br />
You are shocked when the latex slowly crawls up your left neck. While until now your heads were covered bit by bit with the latex you notice that it was covering the left head all at once. You can´t do anything when it covers your mouth and nose, then your eyes and ears until it finally is everywhere. You have heard her saying what Chad had gotten for them, so you know that you get big flat elephant ears and tusks on that head. And some bull horns and cat eyes. But you have missed what Erik got, so you have no clue what is growing around your mouth and nose and without hands you can´t touch it to guess. You feel the growth of something around your head, but you hasn´t thought that a sunflower would count as a species. But come to think about it, plants are living things, so why wouldn´t they be included.<br />
“Anne, please be finished with the whole ordeal.” You tried to say. You know already that your original mouth would howl and your right one would croak, so you concentrate more on your right one and are deflated to hear a bird like cry. So you can guess that head has a beak now, and you also register that with the cry you now can´t speak human anymore.<br />
<br />
“Luke got some freaky spider pedipalps to show, but to pose as one I think his own extremities are far to big for spider legs, don´t you think Jake? Lucas got his big gorilla arms and chest already from nature, the rest isn´t much work for him. Oh yeah, I nearly forgot to mention that Alex got his crocodile hide to cover his back and that small red baboon like ass he has. Well I hope you tell me what you will be wearing then. See you tomorrow, Jake.”<br />
You sigh in relief that the voicemail was over, but it was a little relief as you had nothing left human beside the things that would change now.<br />
The latex starts to cover all your arms and your chest, bulking everything up to look like a gorilla. With that additional strength maybe you could be able to get the door open again, but only when your body has already filled the latex, with could take some time. You had noticed that the latex wasn´t hard enough to push against the door before as it wasn´t filled. You wouldn´t be in that situation if your antlers hadn´t been finished long before.<br />
At the same time as your arms were getting bigger, the opposite happens to your legs, as they are pressed slimmer by the latex. You remember Anne mentioned spider legs, which are normally thinner in relation to the body as they were with a human.<br />
On your mostly covered right head, right next to the bloating frog mouth grow something. But unlike the tusks on your normal and right head they are bend towards each other, more like your pinchers. But you can´t place them at the moment, you didn´t know what pedipalps could be as you don´t like spiders. <br />
Your lower back got slowly covered by the latex, as if it was stretched to thin on you, but together with your ass this was covered in the end. Your back gained a rough surface while your ass expanded a bit, but nothing to outstanding against the rest of your body.</p>
