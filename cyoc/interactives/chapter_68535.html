<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was NOT how Samuel Payne envisioned Red Rock Juvenile Center! He figured he'd lay low for a bit, prove he was useful, making sure not <br />
to get himself trapped or prove himself a threat to any big fish already in the pond. He hadn't founded, lead, and kept in control of the Royal <br />
Paynes by dumb luck after all! He knew how to plan, and how to defend himself, and how to be brutal! He could inspire loyalty and fear when <br />
he needed either (and was careful not to confuse the two)! <br />
<br />
Instead, he was being being led by a LITTLE GIRL in a black and yellow long skirt and apron that could bore a vague resemblance to a <br />
priestess' outfit. &quot;I'm Faith Fiona by the way!&quot; Yellow eyes looked back at him framed by yellow hair. Phoenix Polly was the first 'Magical Girl' <br />
complete or not that Samuel had seen so far that had opposing colored eyes and hair. She smiled happily at him like she was inviting him to <br />
a tea party with her stuffed animals!  Her black dress reached halfway past her knees, and her hair nearly reached her ankles, and the ringed <br />
staff she was holding bigger than she was! <br />
<br />
Samuel was tempted to -try- and attack her, but these Magical Girls seemed more than willing to teach manners to new arrivals and he had <br />
seen first hand that they were anywhere as helpless or vulnerable as they looked. In short, Samuel wasn't stupid. &quot;I-I'm Samuel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She knows that already beotch.&quot; Miracle Mary said, that weird white creature going from one shoulder to the next. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now don't go causing trouble again please.&quot; Said two identical sweet voice echoing. <br />
<br />
Samuel turned to see Lee Chin and Matt Nickson looking none too worse for wear for just being electrocuted or slammed into a bus face first <br />
apparently made to meet their cell mates as well. Was their hair a bit longer? Naw. Couldn't be. <br />
<br />
The two voices that had spoke were a pair of twins.  They had white hair and almost ghostly white eyes. Their hair style was short and curved <br />
framing their sweet smiling faces.  Their were pretty much mirror images of each other except for the name and number on their badges. <br />
They were the MGs who had carted Chin and Matt away before. Their costumes had round thick trim, made of whites and pale pinks, and the <br />
Red Cross was on the back and front of their costumes. Their body language and tone made Samuel wonder if he was seeing some magic <br />
trick. For a crazy moment he wondered if she was a MG with the power to create replicas of herself or something. But why would they have <br />
different badges then? <br />
<br />
The less Samuel thought of it, the better! <br />
<br />
&quot;Bad trip. Bad trip.&quot; Matt Nickson kept muttering to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO TALKING!&quot; Said guard Faith Fiona, STILL smiling! <br />
<br />
Everyone did shut up. <br />
<br />
Samuel couldn't believe how except for the twins, he couldn't see any two magical girls who were exactly alike. Plenty were similar, but none <br />
of them were 'copies.' Many were just happily chatting to each other about stereotypical things little girls talk about like My Little Pony! <br />
<br />
He saw one Egyptian themed magical girl chatting to her partner with their backs to cell bars. A prisoner came behind her as silent as a cat, <br />
in fact he had purple cat ears! She back handed him through the bars without even turning around or pausing in her chat about which pony <br />
was cooler. Still not turning around she pointed her egyptian style crane scepter at him that shoot out bandages that covered him like a <br />
mummy! The prisoner's legs and arms moved into a burial pose as as Samuel heard him struggle inside the layers of cloth, his screams <br />
becoming softer the more he struggled. <br />
<br />
The five underage convicts  passed through a set of doors that lead to a room full of folding chairs and a stage. Samuel instantly saw that <br />
there several more new arrivals there as well. Some looked angry. Some looked depressed. Many looked ready to break down in tears. The <br />
scary ones had no expression at all, waiting for their chance that were sure would come. None of them had been given prison uniforms yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right in! You're the last to arrive!&quot; Faith Fiona said looking up at her prisoners and pointing with her staff.<br />
<br />
There were two more magical girls on the stage. One had spiky brownish red hair and cat ears on top of her head opposed to human ones <br />
on her side. She had a brown red cat tail swaying behind her tip with a ruby ring. She was dress in a red and gold suit of armor that <br />
resembled a bikini almost with hip guards, not that she had anything to show. She was holding a giant buster sword/Zanbat&amp;#333; in one hand. <br />
Her smile revealed cat fangs. Her reddish brown eyes were feline too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Konichiwa Chief!&quot; Waved the armored cat girl at Miracle Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this all of'em?&quot; Asked the other magical girl. She had rainbow stripped hair and rose colored eyes. Her costume's main color was pretty <br />
much blue. Sneakers with rainbow colored lightning bolt on them. Skin tight black shorts underneath a short pelted skirt. She also wore a <br />
white tube top under an open blue jacket that cut off above her belly button with short sleeves. The jacket had the same rainbow lightning <br />
bolt on the back. She was wearing back racing gloves in which she held an innocent looking baseball. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Nothing too special. Just give them the standard introduction and filtering. And by the book.&quot; Miracle Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a book?&quot; The cat MG asked looking at the rainbow MG.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we do. Remember that.&quot; Said Moonshine, baby blue sparkling.<br />
<br />
The rainbow MG waved off. &quot;Fine fine. Wasn't gonna do anything anyway. Give me SOME credit Chief.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Miracle Mary left out a side door while Faith Fiona stayed behind the crowd. <br />
<br />
&quot;COME ON!&quot; One juvie girl stood up. &quot;There's how many of us and just three of them?! We can take--&quot; *BONG*<br />
<br />
&quot;You take a nice nap now.&quot; Faith Fiona coo'ed her staff having doubled in length as she knocked the disrupter out. &quot;Looks like you'll have to <br />
take introductions by yourself later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HELLO HELLO YOU WIDDLE GIRLIE GIRLS!&quot; Said the blue cladded MG grinning holding her baseball back over her shoulders. &quot;This here is <br />
Neko Nikki!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Konichiwa!&quot;Neko Nikki waved happily, did she have claws?<br />
<br />
The blue MG pointed a thumb at her chest, &quot;And I'm Rainbow Rachel! Go ahead and make fun of my name! No seriously! Get it off your <br />
chests! Come on? What's wrong? Scared? Chickens! Well! I'm sure Chief and Moonshine told you why you're here! But before you get bored <br />
with a long lecture and a lot of backstory, we're going to see if you actually belong here. Nikki? Go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Rachel!&quot; Neko Nikki stepped forward. &quot;Hiiii! Welcome to Red Rock Juvenile Center! You can see we do things differently around here! <br />
Now. The process into a magical girl is one hundred precent irreversible! Like the death penalty. Now, we can't go turning people who were <br />
framed or just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time into Magical Girls with permanent alternations to your sense of self! <br />
Well, except if we're faced with the Apocalypse or a full scale alien invasion, but thankfully we've never had one of those and I'd rather not-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nikki. On topic.&quot; Rainbow Rachel said with her armed crossed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right! Sorry Rachel! Anyhow! Now there's less than five Magical Girls who have this trick like I do. And we can't control what kind of <br />
magical girl you'll turn into, and I can't be at every police department and prison in the country so--who here is innocent-?!&quot; She said smiling <br />
looking at us all with those big eyes they all seemed to have.<br />
<br />
Samuel laughed. So did Maria Rodreguiz. And then so did the rest of the delinquents. Everyone raised their hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? All of you?! Cool! In that case you're all free to go! If you just let me cut you in half with my sword first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every stopped laughing and lowered her hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now now! I'm serious! My blade is [i] special. [/i] It'll never cut the innocent, including magical girls. See?&quot; She fell on her own sword, and it <br />
moved through her like it was a hologram. She then sent it through Rainbow Rachel's neck, with it again going through like it was a super <br />
imposed image not leaving a mark. <br />
<br />
She dug the sword tip into the stage with a loud clang. &quot;Now whose innocent here?&quot; <br />
<br />
This time only two raised their hands. Both were lads looking just a year away from real prison. One was wearing a leather jacket and boots <br />
and had a face full of scars. The other was clean black sweeter and clean gray pants, who was smiling. <br />
<br />
Rainbow Rachel had them come up to the stage at the same time. &quot;You two swear you're innocent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite. I have done nothing wrong what so ever.&quot; Said the one in the black sweater.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've gotten into a lotta fights but I've never killed anybody!&quot; Said the boy in the leather jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold still then!&quot; Neko Nikki cheered as she stabbed the lad in the leather jacket. Again it went through him like it wasn't there. The boy <br />
flinched, but was amazed to find he was completely unharmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Faith Fiona? Can you be sure this lad's sentence is reduced to zero and be sent home without any modifications?&quot; Said Nikki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha!&quot;<br />
<br />
The brown sweater lad looked even more confident now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold still!&quot; Nikki stabbed him, and blood ran down her sword and the black sweeter became wet. The lad gasped and feel to his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;MEDIC!&quot; Rainbow Rachel shouted.<br />
<br />
Faith Fiona did a triple forward flip over the crowd and landed right next to the lad who was bleeding to death. She held the tip of her ringed <br />
staff to the stomach wound and chanted, &quot;Curaga!&quot; <br />
<br />
The sweeter still had a hole in it, but the lad was fine, and . .  did he look a tiny bit younger? Samuel wasn't sure it was so slight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now remember. Magical girls don't lie.&quot; Faith Fiona said to the lad on the floor before  she took the leather cladded boy's hand smiling at <br />
him. He blushed at the much smaller girl. &quot;Now let's get you out of this awful place.&quot; <br />
<br />
The boy looked like he wasn't sure he wanted to go but Faith Fiona led him along and out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go back to your seat now.&quot; Neko Nikki said to the black sweater boy who scampered off to do so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Said Rainbow Rachel tapping her baseball bat against her shoulder lightly. &quot;I'm sure by now a lot of you are thinking. 'This crude can't <br />
be real' or 'we gotta be in a big VR machine' or 'I'm dreaming all this!' I did too. Like they say, I'm also a client. As for you guys in denial. Go <br />
ahead and keep thinking that. Because it's NOT going to change a thing about what's going to happen to you! You set your course and <br />
weighted your anchor and this is the port you've ended up at! Now. Just to hammer in that this isn't a game, and that you're going to treat us <br />
ALL with absolute respect, and when we tell you to jump, you'll ask how high while already jumping-<br />
<br />
<br />
All of you. Come at me. All at once. If you WANT TO, the rest of you just stay back. I won't even use any flashy magic other than Slugger <br />
here.&quot; She slammed baseball bat into her palm. She jumped off the stage. &quot;Now those of you who don't think they can take on one measly <br />
little girl with a baseball bat all by herself. You can stand against the walls. And Nikki won't lift a paw to help me in the meantime! Magical <br />
Girl's honor!&quot;<br />
<br />
Neko Nikki just nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you can use me as a hostage to get out of here. Come on, are you tough guys and tough ladies?  Or shall we start handing out the <br />
pink and lace panties?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samuel stood back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I stand a chance after seeing what you monsters can do!&quot; Maria surprisingly said. &quot;But the way you talk! I've GOT to see what <br />
you're made of!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see how well you do WITHOUT the element of surprise!&quot; Lee Chin declare roaring with anger. <br />
<br />
Matt and Keith stayed back with Samuel (Samuel had had enough of their baiting). About a forth of the room stayed back. The rest on a <br />
silent signal descended on Rainbow Rachel like buzzard on roadkill. <br />
<br />
They exploded off her like Agent Smith off Neo from The Matrix Reloaded. She swung her baseball like a pro brawler, throwing in western <br />
style martial arts moves while she was at it. They were knocked off her like rubber balls off a wall. A bruised eye there, a cracked rib there, a <br />
dislocated joint somewhere. It didn't matter they were coming from every direction, she's elbow, knee, punch, head butt, kick, and slam <br />
home-runs with her baseball bat. <br />
<br />
Lee Chin came from above her, she tossed her baseball bat into the air where it hit him in the face. While it was in the air Maria Rodreguiz <br />
came straight for Rainbow Rachel. The MG blocked her blows and kicked her behind the knee and did a fist slam on her shoulder knocking <br />
Maria to her hands and knees. Rainbow Rachel caught her baseball bat. She straightened out her short rainbow hair.<br />
<br />
The blue clothed MG hopped back into stage and looked at the broken horde at her feet. &quot;MEDIC!&quot; <br />
<br />
After all being magically healed and back in their seats. Rainbow Rachel said, &quot;Now, one more thing now that we've filtered out the chaff <br />
from the wheat and we've established whose in charge.&quot; Rachel turned around, and took off her back. <br />
<br />
Keith and Matt both gasped. Samuel's felt his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
Across Rachel's back was scars from claw slashes. Rainbow Rachel glared back at them with her rose colored eyes. &quot;What did this could have <br />
eaten you all alive. So I hope we've now all established you're not big fish in little ponds anymore.&quot; <br />
<br />
No one said anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we've got the first part of the orientation and filtering out of the way, Magical Nurses Namine And Nicole will be giving you a short <br />
physical examine. Not different from a typical doctor's visit, and of course a search for contraband, weapons, and all those things. Oh, and <br />
there's a mirror just before you see them. Think of it as your chance to say goodbye to the person in the mirror. Because they won't be <br />
around for long . . . And the more of you that turns out to be rotten to the core, the more we're going to have to dig out. And feel free to <br />
fake it, we've found that actually HELPS the conversion process along. You'll never realize you've stopped just &lt;i&gt; pretending &lt;/i&gt; to love <br />
justice and harmony and have embraced the magical girl creed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samuel and the others marched along like condemned on death row almost. Nothing to look forward to except the end. <br />
<br />
A magical girl in a shinning blue and silver suit of armor with blue hair and blue eyes a bit taller than most crossed her arms as we came into <br />
the next room.  She looked a bit older and taller than most of the MG they had seen. She had a golden sword on her hip with the hilt shaped <br />
like a dragon. <br />
<br />
She spoke in a harsh voice. &quot;I am Camelot Carol! A servant of justice and protect of the innocent! And YOU will all be servants of justice and <br />
protectors of the innocent! All personal belongings in the number boxes on the left. All your clothes, everything, including underwear, down <br />
the chute on the right. You can do this yourselves. And I can get the nurses to do it for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In front of everyone-?!&quot; Matt exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes in front of everyone. Anyone who tries to take advantage of anyone else physically or sexually I'll break their arm.&quot;  <br />
<br />
They all obeyed. 'Like sheep,'  Samuel thought. Samuel did his best not to look in case he brought down the wraith of the knight in shining <br />
armor. <br />
<br />
Samuel decided to at least enjoy the view he got of the girls around him. They didn't seem that concerned at all at keeping the genders <br />
separate. He came into a doctor's office where everything was scaled to children. <br />
<br />
Inside were the two little girl nurses he had seen before. The examine was incredible mundane. First his name. Then his height, weight, age, <br />
blood sample, urine sample, reflexes, temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure, everything. He was surprised when they didn't inject him with <br />
anything. <br />
<br />
&quot; Just so you know, your name and social security numbers are going to be erased from the IRS data base.&quot; Nicole (according to her badge) <br />
Began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be given a NEW social security number upon your complete conversion into a knowing and willing magical girl whose only desire in <br />
their pure light filled hearts is protect the innocent, uphold justice and to oppose evil.&quot; And finished Namine. <br />
<br />
Samuel suddenly felt very trapped. <br />
<br />
Samuel found he had nothing to say. <br />
<br />
He was sent along for the next poor sap.<br />
<br />
He found . . . his own clothes waiting for him in the next room? Washed and pressed? What had been the point of that? He was surprised <br />
when they didn't give him a pair of panties instead of his own underwear. But he put them on. <br />
<br />
A bell jingled and let him into the next room. <br />
<br />
he found a bunch of people sitting down. In a green chinese dress with matching green eyes and hair was a MG with that famous 'meat ball' <br />
hairstyle. A message on a whiteboard behind her read &quot;Sit down and wait for instructions. No Talking yet. Or Else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samuel knew full well at this point that these magical girls were able and willing to carry out their threats at misbehavior. <br />
<br />
Finally Maria, Matt, Lee Chin, and Keith entered as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that's we're all here! I'm Mirror Mira! Now just answer the questions truthfully. If you lie, I'll know. Just a little unique trick of mine. And <br />
if any of you misbehave-&quot; She took out a blue and green hand mirror that turned into a staff with the mirror on the end. &quot;You can look into <br />
my mirror instead. It'll make you see yourself with perfect objectivity. You'll see yourself for who you really are. And I promise, you will <br />
scream.&quot; She looked at herself in a mirror. And smiled. &quot;I'm a good person.&quot;<br />
<br />
A cabbit (this one black with purple eyes) hopped along and handed off questioniar to everyone along with some dull tipped and blueberry <br />
scented Mr. Sketch pens. <br />
<br />
The questions were rather strange. <br />
<br />
Favorite color? Favorite animal? Favorite super heroes? Favorite fairy tale? Favorite place to go with family on a vacation? Are you thinking you <br />
can lie on this test? Are you scared? Are you angry? Favorite cartoon character? Favorite anime (if any)? Favorite Disney movie? Favorite flavor <br />
of ice-cream(if any)? Do you smoke? Do you drink alcoholic beverages? Who do you love more (if either) your mother or your father? What's <br />
you favorite childhood memory? Do you prefer weapons or hand to hand combat when fighting someone? Are you scared of being all alone? <br />
How big a badass do you think you really are? Have you given up plans to escape just yet? What's your favorite mythical creature? What's your <br />
favorite number?<br />
<br />
The questions turned into a blur of letters and question marks for Samuel, so many question, so banal, but throwing a stinger in there just <br />
every so often to throw him off. Samuel sighed. This wasn't what he expected at all.</p>
