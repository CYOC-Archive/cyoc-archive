<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he walked out the shoe store, Ryan felt his brand new iPhone buzzing in one of his pockets. He glanced at the screen and noticed that it was a text from Lucas, one of his best friends, asking him out for lunch.<br />
<br />
Lucas was a man in his early 20s, with cute but bland features, dirty blond hair and a somewhat unkempt stubble. He also was definitely down to his luck: he had just been fired again due to some weird merge his company had with another one; luckily for him, he was one of the most upbeat and optimistic persons Lucas knew, but that day he too looked miserable. &quot;Sorry to bore you with all this,&quot; Lucas said after he had finished recounting how he had been thrown out of the company. &quot;You have an amazing job at that firm, you rock that suit and tie and you can get all the men you want... sometimes I wish I could be you,&quot; he sighed.<br />
<br />
Ryan gave him a predatory smile. &quot;Well... I think I can help you with that... Come with me.&quot; He paid the restaurant bill and took Lucas to his luxurious and modern bachelor attic. &quot;Sit down,&quot; he said in a commanding tone, pushing his smaller and very confused friend on the sofa. &quot;And take off your shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... okay?&quot; Lucas murmured, taking off his old, battered sneakers. &quot;But I don&#39;t see how this can help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be clear soon,&quot; Ryan said, before kneeling down in front of Lucas and taking a quick sniff at his size eight feet. &quot;Mmmh...&quot; he moaned before he started licking the soles and sucking the toes with abandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey, dude! What are you doing?! You know I&#39;m not into g...&quot; Lucas tried to protest, before a really pleasant sensation - a shiver not unlike an electrical current - travelled upwards from his feet directly to his brain. &quot;Nngh... feels s-so good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it will be even better now...&quot; Ryan whispered with a manic grin. He had untied his own dress shoes, and with quick movements he slipped them on Lucas&#39; feet, where the magical shoes tied themselves up. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-what... oh, man...&quot; Lucas wiggled on the sofa as his eyes rolled in the back of his head. He could feel his feet slowly cracking and lengthening to fill Ryan&#39;s shoes; it was a weird sensation, something he had never felt - or dreamed to feel - before. &quot;What... what is happening...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re becoming a new man, Lucas... enjoy the ride,&quot; Ryan replied, before he jumped on the sofa next to his friend and stuck his warm tongue into Lucas&#39;s mouth. After a brief moment of hesitation Lucas started reciprocating the kiss as the transformative power of the shoes rewrote his brain to be 100% gay and to have foot and suit&tie fetishes. His legs became more toned and muscular as his denim pants got black and pinstriped as the rough cloth changed to a ridiculously expensive blend of cotton and silk. A Gucci belt appeared in the loops of his trousers, with a large and yet elegant buckle materializing just above his groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, god... feels so good...&quot; Lucas moaned as he felt the small layer of fat on his belly dissipate, leaving behind a nice, toned pack of abs and two meaty pecs topped by rock-hard nipples that practically screamed &#39;Yes, I can afford a personal trainer&#39;. Ryan, meanwhile, had fished his ten inches dick from his pants and was masturbating furiously at the sight of his friend becoming a sexy, handsome, obscenely rich and completely gay sharp dressed man just like he was. As Lucas&#39; cheap t-shirt became a perfectly fitting white button-up shirt with a pair of exquisite silver cuff links, he reached his climax, cum splattering over his tie and his manly dark brown beard.<br />
<br />
Lucas was lost in the pleasure of the changes, barely registering a pale pink tie slithering around his neck like a silky snake, or the black vest and jacket appearing over his now muscular physique. He did, however, feel his features rearranging a bit, his chin becoming chiseled and virile before a short full dark blond beard covered it at the same time his hair styled itself into a perfectly coiffured faux-hawk; his eyes turned into a deep blue, alluring and sexy, and his nose became a bit longer and straighter, a bona fide Roman nose. A fat leather wallet full of cash and credit cards appeared in his pocket, along with a brand new smartphone and the keys of a black Lamborghini. His hard dick, now as long and girthy as Ryan&#39;s, creamed the inside of his Armani boxers. <br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck... that was intense, man...&quot; Lucas said, his voice now a bit deeper and leagues more confident, as he leaned over to kiss his hot boyfriend and lick the cum trapped in his beard. Another shot of energy travelled upwards from the shoes and once again rewrote the sexuality of the two: they were only going to be attracted by men dressed as sharply and impeccably as they were... but luckily, they realized with a wicked grin, they had the perfect way to make that happen.</p>
