<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff hurried back into his room and sat his bare butt on the computer chair. The Chronivac was 90% finished altering the history of humanity just so Jeff could pee soda out of his dick. <br />
“Ok, time to fix everything up...” He looked for the yearned ‘Cancel’ button, but the computer screen was becoming blurry... No wait, everything was becoming blurry to Jeff!<br />
“Ugh, why do I feel so dizzy out of a sudden...?” The boy squinted with his eyes but that didn’t help. “What’s happening to my eyes... I can’t see! Holy shit I’m blind!” He touched his face with his hands, but he couldn’t find his eyes! He didn’t even had empty eye sockets, it was like touching the blank face of a mannequin made of human flesh. He felt his nose and ears disappearing next. <br />
“NO! FUCK!!” He said with a high-pitched nasal voice. “This damned Chronivac! I told it that I didn’t want to lose my human features!... No, I don’t want to go full inanim-...” But he couldn’t finish his sentence as his lips closed shut forever. The faceless young man wanted to cry but he didn’t know how. The hair on his head, his last recognizable facial feature, fell off. <br />
The naked creature without a face fell down of its chair but his right hand remained on the computer mouse, clicking blindly at the screen just to see if he could click that elusive button that would revert everything back to normal. But soon his fingers stated merging and his arms shortening... his superior limbs were shrinking down to nothing and so was his blank head!<br />
The nipples on his pecs disappeared, and the pecs themselves followed suit. His bellybutton and his belly experienced a similar process and soon enough only the waist down of the young man remained.<br />
Jeff struggled to stand up on his two feet, his dick flopping up and down with freedom as he tried to do so.<br />
“Oh, god...” Thought Jeff. “Am I just a pair of legs and a dick?...WHY?! I don&#39;t understand! I didn&#39;t want this!” The blind pair of legs ran in circles in its panic, feeling how its ass and dick crashed with every piece of furniture on the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jeff’s father, Richard, was talking to his boss as he drove using his car’s hands-free device.<br />
“I’m so sorry Michael, I just can’t explain it in words...” Richard apologized. “I can remember perfectly that just yesterday you had hired my son to be the new drinking water fountain for the office, but for some reason I forgot to bring him along with me when I left this morning...”<br />
“Don’t worry about it.” Said his boss’ voice through the communicator. “For some reason we all appear to be very forgetful today. For some reason I couldn’t remember that my wife was a toaster until she called me a few minutes ago. Stupid, right? Haha. In any case, if you hurry up your son will be working with us in here just in time for lunchtime... Seriously Richard, I have never met anyone like your son before. A *soda* fountain! He really impressed me at the interview yesterday. Not only that, but he’s very well educated too, he’s brilliant and very applicated as an inanimate object! The fact that he is &#39;fixed&#39; is a great plus as well.”<br />
“Yeah, that’s right.” Replied Richard. “It was my father-in-law’s idea to have him fixed up at an early age. He wanted his grandson to be proud of his inanimate roots, so we got all of his unnecessary parts removed. Because as most recent studies show, the more human-looking the inanimate object, the less efficient it&#39;ll be at its primary function.” Stated Jeff’s father with pride.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt relieved when he regained his sight. But there was something weird about his vision, it was more cylindrical and one-eyed... Oh crap. Jeff shook his dick and his vision shaked as well and his fears were confirmed. He now saw through his peehole.<br />
“Oh god, I must look so ridiculous...” Jeff said aloud and he realized he could talk through his vibrating urethral.<br />
The pair of legs approached the desk and his dick looked at the Chronivac’s screen. <br />
“98%...Don’t tell me there’s even more stuff to change!”<br />
He wanted to cancel the process, but his penis couldn’t reach the mouse, much less operate it. Jeff then heard his father’s car parking in front of the house. “Holy shit! If he sees me like this I’m so fucked!” The sentient pair of legs tried to think of a safe place to hide, but his cock wasn’t prehensile enough to twist door handles, so he was stuck inside his room.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Richard entered Jeff’s room.<br />
“No, Dad! Don’t look at me! I’m ridiculous!” Thought Jeff.<br />
“Squish! Thank god you’re here! I completely forgot I had to bring you to the office today! It’s your first day of work!”<br />
“Squish?” Wondered Jeff, and then something clicked inside him. “Squish Soda! That’s me!” Vibrated Jeff’s urethra against his will producing a high-pitched and happy voice. “A gentle squish on my prick and POP! A explosion of flavour in your mouth! I’ve got Coke, Pepsi, Fanta...”<br />
“I know you’re enthusiastic to relieve yourself, but I haven’t got time to drink, Squish! Hurry up into the car! You need to make a good first impression.”<br />
“Aww.” Replied Squish with disappointment.<br />
Jeff was utterly confused by his own actions. Did this meant that while his mind had been unaffected by the reality shift, his body urges did change? Shit! He remembered his old self but he couldn’t resist the urge to present himself with his motto in case someone wanted a drink! He really needed to piss...<br />
<br />
As the Chronivac reached 100%, a Squish Soda logo appeared on Jeff’s left thigh, and a message appeared on the screen: “Changes completed. Duration: Undefined / Until user reverts changes.” Then Richard closed the laptop and unplugged it, wondering what the computer was doing in Squish’s room, and promptly double-patted Jeff’s buttocks so he would start walking. Suddenly Jeff shat a plastic cup out of his ass.<br />
“Whoops, sorry son, I always forget your behind is also your plastic cup dispenser. Must be your grandmother’s water fountain genes. Anyway, no time to waste.”<br />
Jeff panicked. He didn’t want to go to work, he just wanted his laptop back so he could revert the changes! He screamed internally, but all that came out was “Squish Soda, that’s me! A gentle squish on my prick and...”<br />
“Zip it, son! You’ll need your soda tank full if you want to make a good impression on your first day!”<br />
The pair of walking legs had no other option but to get inside the car. It wasn&#39;t looking forward to wet himself in public for a living.</p>
