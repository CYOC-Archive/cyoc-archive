<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was not a surprise to the Barber when the bell above his door jingled that afternoon.  Nor was the real reason the three men who entered his store and turned the lock behind them a surprise.  <br />
<br />
	“Hope you don’t mind closing down as we discuss some business.” The obvious leader of the group said turning the small card in the front window over to “Closed.”<br />
	Gossip among the local shopkeeper was strong.  Word was out that there were some toughs in the area selling “protection” services to the local store keepers.  Roughing up anyone who didn’t jump when they said jump.  The Barber was actually shocked when his previous customer, Kwambe came in for a touch up sporting a swollen lip and eye.  The guys had roughed him up pretty good shaking him down for money.  Thankfully the head shave the Barber gave Kwambe again returned his African good looks and repaired the damage done.  Kwambe HAD been a closeted 40 something, white, balding business man who’s life was going no where.  NOW he was a teen age African import working boy who’s street life didn’t come with a health care plan, but did come with Mike, a loving blonde hunk of a man child who was going to do something stupider than usual if he ever caught the hoods who beat his lover up.  And the Barber just couldn’t have his customers coming to any harm.<br />
	“We’ve just moved to this area, it’s a nice side of town and we think it should stay that way.  In order to help out, we’re offering a protection service.” The leader said.  He was a well built man in his late 20’s.  Brown hair, nice suit.  But the face was hard.  There was an anger behind the eyes that couldn’t be masked.  Not a normal anger either, but an odd hostility at anything in his way.  <br />
	“We also think your store traffic would improve if you had a couple of those video game booths in here too.  Kids love those.” The shorter stockier man said moving in very close to the Barber. The square shoulders and almost ape like foreman gave the impression that the man could be intimidating when he wanted to.  And his body language said he wanted to intimidate quite often.<br />
	The last man said nothing but continued to lookout the window, as if watching for anyone who might notice the shop mysteriously close din the middle of the afternoon.  As he turned to look up and down the street the Barber couldn’t help notice the gun shove in the top of his pants.  He was thin, the kind of thin a guy into too much drugs gets.  The bags under his eyes told of long nights and secret terrors.  <br />
	Over all though these three men didn’t give off the aura of being true hoods, just low life creeps who watched a few episodes of the Sopranos once to often.  It wasn’t even so much the money they wanted, it was the power, or at least the feeling of power over the people they sold their “services” too.  <br />
	“Interesting proposition.” The Barber said not giving his ground no matter how close the muscle of the group.  “And how much will this cost me?”<br />
	“$700 a month, plus what ever’s in the till when we stop by.”<br />
	“And will I get any cut from the video games?”<br />
	“No, I don’t think you understand.  That’ll be an additional $300 rental on top of what ever’s in the game’s coin boxes.”<br />
	“Ah.  I see.  Now I do understand.  Well, how can I turn down such a generous proposition?”<br />
	“Glad you see things our way.”<br />
	“So, if I may offer.  I’m sure you gentlemen have quite a few more stops to make in the days ahead.  Correct?  Well, how about complementary haircuts to seal the deal.  Not that you don’t look good now, but I’d like to give you a sample of the services you’re going to be protecting.”<br />
	“Not today, we don’t’ have time to wait for you to take care of….”<br />
	“If you’ll get in the chairs I can take care of all three of you at once.”<br />
<br />
	They had places to go and people to see but for some reason, a hair cuts seemed like the best idea they had ever heard at the time.  The three men got into the chairs and sat quietly as the barber placed a cloth around each of their necks.  He started with the leader.<br />
	“Going to lean you back so I can wash you hair and give it a good treatment.”<br />
	Methodically the Barber leaned the three men back so their heads rested in the sinks.  Carefully and with attention to the details he rinsed out then shampooed each man’s head of hair, leaving them resting back to drain as he moved onto the next man.  <br />
<br />
	“Allez Opp” the barber said as he moved all three men back into a sitting position.  All three now sported full heads of thick jet black hair that hung down to their shoulders.  Each man had a sudden questioning look on their face as they saw their looks in the mirror in front of them.  Yet none were really able to speak of it since… they’d come in with that hair didn’t they?<br />
<br />
	“The wet hair seems to be making you shiver a bit sir, why not start with you?” The Barber said taking a towel to the gun man’s head.  He covered the man’s head with the towel and gave it a few good rubs. After removing it the man’s hair was a bit dryer, and his mouth and chin were covered by a thin goatee.  Picking up the hair clippers the sudden clack filled the room as the Barber went to work shaving the man’s hair down to an 8th of an inch.  With each pass the man became larger, but given the original build, larger was the only direction he had to go.  He filled out; arms became larger but not huge.  The muscles showed through the thin layer of skin.  Shoulder a bit wider.  The man was becoming who he could have been if not for the drugs.  A smile crept on his lips.  The goatee seemed a bit odd, and it wasn’t filling in much, kind of sparse, but that was ok.  He was looking sharp.  The future had more possibilities now.  When the Barber was done a new man sat in the chair.  Head all but shaved, eye clearer, body not that of a bodybuilder but would have looked great under a tight shirt.  Like one of those models in the queer catalogue, almost like was now in his early 20’s.<br />
<br />
	“Stay there while I take care of your big friend over here.” The Barber said moving onto the muscle of the group.  The Barber didn’t use the clippers on this man, but went to work with the scissors.  Clipping and cutting the now black hair outward, spiking it and leaving it in a punkish style.  While he worked the man grew to unbelievable proportions.  In height not so much, maybe only an inch or two, but in width, he almost broke the chair.  Muscles swelled, ballooning up like never before.  Now only did his pecs obviously blow up till the sheet draped off them but his legs swelled to the point to where they’re pressing against each other, tightly confined in the chair.  When the Barber was done a muscle god now sat there, no older than 20.  The muscle god the man might have been had he spent the time he need in the gym and not spent his life proving his “manhood” against those he felt we weaker than him.<br />
<br />
	“Very nice.  One more and we’re almost done.  Stay here.” The Barber said before moving onto the last member of the group, the leader.  The cutting here was more subtle, giving the man a crown of hair the framed his face in long bangs and feather cut sides.  The almost angelic result was still countered by the intensity behind the eyes.  His build became more solid, defined muscles but not as built out as his partners.  Almost a runner’s build.  Legs thin but rock solid.  Arms strong but defined.  Yes, this was a man who could move into the room and impress anyone seeing him.  Now the panther on the outside that he felt caged within him all those years.<br />
<br />
	“How do you like gentlemen?” The Barber said walking down the row and removing the cloths around each of the men’s necks. Underneath they no longer wore the street clothes they walked in with.  From the waist up, they were bare chested.  From the waist down, they wore low riding leather pants, skin tight and brand new.  <br />
	Each man leapt from the chair and made for the mirror.  Nervous laughter came over them as they moved and the man they had always wanted to be moved in the mirror.  <br />
	“I can’t belive this.” The leader laughed. “Lou…lou are you seeing…” he said turning to the muscle man next to him.  He was almost too busy posing and checking himself out to even hear the questions.  <br />
	“We are the shits Tommy.  THE SHITS!!!!”  He bellowed.<br />
	“I would have thought people considered you shits long before you came into my store.” The Barber said as he got out his smaller beard trimmer.<br />
	“What?” Doug the former druggie asked rubbing his hand over his head, feeling the bristle like quality of the buzz cut. “I can’t belive, there’s no withdrawal feeling left, fee for once in my life...”<br />
	“Do you know, DO YOU FUCKING KNOW what we can do with bodies like this!!!?!?!”  The leader asked, “We can OWN this block by the end of the week and then GOD KNOWS where else we could move to.”<br />
	“Umm, yes well, let’s not bring any higher powers into this that don’t need to know what’s going on for their own good.  Anyway, gentlemen.  I’m glad you like the haircuts but we’re not quite done.  I’d hate to think I’d let you go out looking like that.” The Barber said gesturing to the man’s pants.<br />
	“What’d ya…”<br />
	“To put it delicately sir, I’m afraid you’re all a bit more manly than the pants can hold.  There’s a bit of a bush showing….”<br />
	The men looked down to find that a considerable amount of pubic hair was reveled from the top of the pants.  But thankfully below that major boners strained the leather as they had all popped rods just looking at themselves.<br />
	“Oh geez, look at that.  Never wore pants like this before, didn’t think about that.”<br />
	“And weren’t you warned about that?”<br />
	“Yes, the guys said we couldn’t have any pubic hair showing from out pants.  No wait, not out pants, our g-strings.” The muscle god said suddenly unzipping and dropping trou. “Ah crap look at that, how’s that little piece of cloth suppose to cover all that?  They don’t make bigger g-strings do they?”<br />
	“No,” The Barber said,” But we could make your pubic hair smaller.  If you gentlemen will follow your friend’s example, remove you pants and get back in the chair, I think I have just what you need.”<br />
	Something inside the leader’s mind told him to run, to get out while he was still ahead.  But it made sense, what the Barber was telling him. He couldn’t go out with all this wire like hair sticking out of his pants, no matter how great he looked now.  And the other two were already in their chairs so he had better join them.<br />
<br />
	“This will be two steps.  First let’s clip down all the hair to a more manageable length.  Shall we?”<br />
	Starting with the leader, the Barber pulled back the black g-string to beneath the man’s balls and started clipping away at the pubic bush.  He left behind a nice smooth patch, not too long and almost triangle shaped.  As he cut though, the man’s feature’s changes.  His face became more round, eyes in the classic slant.  His pink skin became fairer, but had a tannish quality.  The dick sitting on top of the g-string became a smoke grey and the man’s nipples a dark brown. The nose shorted and turned up into an almost puckish state. Jaw pointier but check bones more pronounced.   When he was done the leader was now a good looking 18 year old Japanese youth.  Still muscular with the runner’s body, but his eyes were both darker in color but brighter, less intense than before.<br />
	“That’s not right, that shouldn’t” he muttered in a more graspy voice than before.<br />
	“I know, I know, you’ll still have some hair poking out the top of this thing.  That’s where some hot waxing comes in handy.” The Barber said spreading some depilatory wax across the youth’s groin.  He smoothed it out over most of the top pubic hair and placed a removal sheet across it, giving it a few good rubs to work the hot wax and hair into the cloth. “That should be cool and hardened by the time I’m done with the other two.”<br />
<br />
	As the muscle man’s dick hair was cut down he too changed.  Forehead a little higher, bow a bit thicker.  Eyes also took on the almond Asian shape but the lips were heavier.  His skin became almost brown in tone, but not a deep brown.  That was saved for his nipples and cock.  Those were now a deep chocolate.  His lips filled out becoming much fuller on a now wider mouth.  Which unlike his boss’s mouth, was now smiling.  The Barber finished the same way by applying the hot wax, the strip and letting it cool.  As he rubbed the cloth patch into the wax to motion made the guy’s dick do a little dance.  The muscle man was now an 18 year old boy off the boat from Thailand. <br />
<br />
	Last was the druggie.  Down went the g-string and on when the clippers.  His face also turned more oval, taking on a Chinese appearance.  His forehead rose as did his eye brows.  His check bones rounded off and his chin did too.  His new goatee, thin and kind of sparse fit the face of the 18 year old boy he now was, as if growing it was a challenge due to his ethnicity and age.  The cock darkened to a solid grey while his skin was still fairly pale.  He too was smiling as the Barber applied the hot wax to the top of the groin.<br />
<br />
	“This can’t…YOUR INSANE!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO US?!?!?!” The Leader yelled from his chair.  He tried to move but he couldn’t get up from the chair.  A pressure was holding him down.  <br />
<br />
	“I think the world has enough trouble assholes in it don’t you?  I’ve given you a look at what you could have been. But that’s only because somewhere, deep down, once we’re all done, I want that memory to still be there, to still be a longing for what could have been.  Not that you’ll hate what’s coming.  It’ll be great!  Trust me.  You’re all going from assholes to being little pricks.  Let’s start with you’re muscular friend first shall we?”<br />
	The leader was able to watch in the mirror reflection as the Barber walked over to Lou, the strong man of the group.  He knew Lou for a long time, knew Lou loved beating people up, it made him feel alive.  But it was better if someone told him to do it, too the blame off him.  To Lou, like was power over other men.  The Barber picked at the corner of the strip and gave it a yank off.  <br />
	It was like Lou’s body collapsed in on itself.  Within seconds the muscles were gone, there was some definition left but not much.  The skin was now smooth as silk, the shoulder narrow and his hips, well the hips were a bit on the wide side.  Nothing major but they had a bit of bounce in them.  He shrank down to 5’1” but the legs still looked long.  The chest became almost flat with two pin prick nipples sitting high on them.  The face become more innocent, the lips pouted now.  Eye shadow appeared over each eye and his fingernails grew out more than most men would feel comfortable having.  The dick, well the dick continued down and down, stopping at about am inch or so when soft.  Not even the dark foreskin that hung off the end could make it seem large enough for the average person not to stare at if seen.  Balls were tight against the body but the sack was hairless.  The g-sting wasn’t having as much of a problem covering things up.  When he was done the figure was still an adult, but by the barest of terms.  A slight, little Thai androgynous man/child got off the chair and stood in front of the mirror.  He swayed slightly as if moving to some music only he could hear.<br />
<br />
	“holy crap.” The leader whispered.<br />
<br />
	“Now for you’re other friend.  Let’s see what fate had in mind.” <br />
	The leader took his eyes away from the former muscle man and looked over to Doug, his drugged out enforcer.  Where Lou couldn’t get people to do thing physically, Doug had no trouble taking this out with his firearms.  Things were just that simple.  People wanting to do that they wanted, living a free life, just couldn’t understand that by acting so obstinate to Tommy, their leader’s wishes, it was keeping him from shooting up again.  So he just had to shoot them.  And cops?  Cops were just fun to shoot. <br />
The strip was ripped off and again, the body deflated.  Not quite as far deflated as the first man, but it didn’t have as far down to go.  While he too shank down to just over 5 feet, and lost a lot of mass, his muscles kept their tightness.  Strong, lean build on a considerable smaller frame.  But face also got younger with still a bit of an edge, maybe thanks to the shaved head.  The dick also became smaller, thinner but kept some of the length.  The foreskin was longer than on his friends, a bit of precum drooled out of the end.  But overall, while he kept some of a punk edge, there was quietness to him now.  There was room for thoughts in his head and the only thing he had to get to was, well….<br />
<br />
	The punk Chinese boy got off the chair, checked himself out in the mirrors for a second and strolled over to the last man in the chair.  “Doug, don’t man, what the hell, it’s me Tommy!!”  But this version of Doug actually didn’t know fully what the Japanese man in the chair was saying, neither one of their English were quite that good.  He just knew a great looking man when he saw one and knew how to make one happy.  He pulled himself up on the chair and kneeled down on the arm rests.  His groin was right in line with the Leader’s mouth.  The long thin cock came out of his thick foreskin was and he rubbed it up and down a few times.  The smaller the cock, the less blood needed to make it hard.  “Jesus, don’” was all Tommy could get out but with a mouth open it was all the Chinese punk needed to slip is cock into his former boss’s mouth.  It tasted strong, musky, like the head hadn’t been cleaned as much as it should.<br />
<br />
	Seeing the action going on the androgynous Thai youth took his eyes away from himself in the mirror, finally and joined in.  Also climbing up on the chair but with his back to the action.  He sat on Tommy’s stomach for a second or two, working the Japanese man’s still large prick into enough of an erection for what he needed.   Scooting forward a bit he positioned himself over the large cock and lowered his tight little ass onto it.  Tommy screamed from the chair but with the Chinese cock in his mouth, it was more than muffled.<br />
<br />
	“If you’ll excuse me.” The Barber said reaching in between all the hot Asian flesh and yanked off Tommy’s waxed strip.  The change was harder to see in Tommy what with his two former partners in crime gyrating on him lap. The young man getting his cock sucked had to move down a bit to accommodate the shrinking size of the man who was servicing him.  And the young man getting fucked had to reach around and reinsert the cock doing the job due to it’s shrinking too. The Barber could see the Japanese man’s legs start to shorten more and more, pulling in till they no longer even came close to reaching down to the foot rest.   And then the two boys began to change some more.<br />
	From his ass up his back and around his shoulders, tribal tattoos started to appear on the Chinese punk.  Black as pitch, thick in back and more detailed along the arms down to his hands.  His chest was now perfectly framed by the tattoos that continued to his front, around his ribcage. Down his stomach, stopping above his prick they reached before they stopped.  His pecs were free of tats, and hair for that matter, but each small nipple has a ring though it.<br />
	The lad on the lap also changed, to much less lad configurations.  His chest started swelling again, but not into the manly pecs that were there before.  No, these were tits.  Or at this size, maybe titties would be better. Small to be sure, they could be covered up by wearing a loose shirt, but they were tits.  Obvious scars appeared underneath each tit, where the surgeon had done a quick job inserting the silicone baggies before the youth came to this country.  A going away present form one of his many “Uncles.”  The prick was still there, small as it was, but the androgyny was now at a new level.  Sprinkles of glitter now highlighted his hair and dangle earrings hung from his lobes.  <br />
	The three men’s breathing all suddenly got quicker, with the Chinese tattooed puck shooting first.  His small hips squeezing his ass together has he pumped his cock down Tommy’s throat while he came.  The Thai she/male getting fucked also came, but took a load at the same time.  His/her voice higher now, softer as she panted her apporval.  <br />
	After a second the slowly climbed down off the chair to reveal Tommy, but it wasn’t Tommy anymore.  It was hardly even an adult.  In the chair was the sweetest Japanese 18 year old schoolboy ever to shake his ass up on stage at “boys Are US”.  Face, pure and simple.  Body thin, trim and free of definition, but healthy.  Hands were small and delicate, fingernails like pearl shells.  Skin free of any blemish, light in tone with a brown undercurrent.  Lips kind of thin but quick to smile.  And they were smiling as they licked the cum off them.  His dick was the smallest of the group, barely there but got the job done.  Then there were the eyes that had before been nothing buy hate. Those eyes now reflected back nothing but freedom and innocents.  There was nothing behind those eyes but a love of being alive and a love of being a boy.  And as only 4’7’, being a boy is what he wanted everyone to think he was.  Cause that meant more customers for after hours fun at the strip club and that meant more big Americans to feel loved by.  And being loved was all it was about.<br />
<br />
	“Sorry to break up the fun Yoshie but it’s getting late and I think you boys might be due back at the club.” The Barber said helping the two boys down off the chair.  Without the larger Tommy to hold onto, it was a bit harder than going up.  <br />
	“Oh you’re right, it’s already dark out.” Yoshie said in his small, broken accented voice. “Keyungsu, where are our jackets?” He asked the Chinese boy.  <br />
	The tattooed punk boy took a moment out from playing with his nipple rings then pointed to the coat rack.  Now sitting on the rack were three small jackets like high school boys might wear.  None of the boys had gone to high school and certainly not in the US, but looked adorable in them.<br />
	“Attakrit will you stop looking at yourself?  OH, and everyone put their pants on.  I’m so sorry Mister Barber.” The three young men ran around pulling up the g-strings then finding out whose leather pants were whose.  These were the outfits they wore as the “Little Pricks” the hottest group of boys to hit the stage at the strip club up the street.  Most of their customers didn’t even know the guys were of different nationalities, but it wasn’t their rice cultural heritage they were interested in.  <br />
<br />
	While still a bit of the leader, the former Tommy was more supportive in his suggestions, saying things to motivate his buddies to get dressed, not ordering them.  Almost like a big brother even though he was the smallest of the group.  For this is how he say the world now, as a positive place where there no evil.<br />
<br />
	Keyungsu, the former Doug didn’t speak as they got dressed, he rarely did and rarely would have even if his English was better.  He let his body language tell all.  Now he was a tough little guy, quick to defend his friends.  They knew they could count on him always having a clear head.  And it took a tough little guy to take it up the ass as much as he did.   <br />
<br />
	While Lou loved to hear people beg him to stop beating them, Attakrit couldn’t hear anything else but the music that made him move.  He loved being both male and female.  Some of the guys kept asking why he didn’t just cut that dick off but, come on, dicks were great!!!  He couldn’t get enough.  He wouldn’t hear of not having a cock to play with.  <br />
<br />
	“I want to thank you boys for coming in today.  You certainly brighten up the neighborhood.”<br />
	They all giggled stopped making eye contact for a moment.  <br />
	“If any customers down at the strip club look like they could use my services, you make sure you send them my way.”<br />
	“Are you kidding, we’ve got some real looser who show up there week and week.  We’ll drag them down here ourselves!!”  They went to leave but found the door locked. ‘Your door’s locked Mr. Barber, you can’t get any customer’s that way” Yoshie said as the three Asian teens ran out of the store and up the street to their workplace.  Their small sneakers slapping the pavement.<br />
<br />
	The rumor mill for the shop keepers started up a few days later.  No one had seen the toughs who came around and threatened to make them all start paying protection money.  Some people remembered there were a couple of undercover policemen around a few weeks before and they disappeared too.  There had to be a connection, people just don’t disappear.  They had to have come across some bigger scheme going on and been “taken care of”.  And it wouldn’t have surprised any of the shop keepers if their bodies turned up in the river.  Not surprised at all.</p>
