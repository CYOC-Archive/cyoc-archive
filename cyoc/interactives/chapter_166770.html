<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided that he was done testing out the app and decided he wanted to cause some chaos. He decided that the school will suddenly go into lockdown with monsters and anthros appearing to attack the students to kill or rape them and only one exit to get out safely being a set of doors leading out to the school yard no monsters will leave the building, even the windows will be shut tight and the glass unbreakable. Those being raped will transform into female versons of the monsters or anthros and will mostly likely lose their minds as they become nothing more than fuck toys for the things if they don&#39;t get away before their minds break. <br />
<br />
He set it so there is a list of those caught and turned along with pictures of their new forms for him to look over and may pick out a couple to be his own sex slaves, and also set so he and Tiffa won&#39;t be raped or kill but some injuries are allowed to be on the two that won&#39;t kill them. The two different groups of monster that kill or rape will go after the other kinds as well for only one kind is allowed through the turned females won&#39;t be killed but used by the victors for there are only males but new ones will appear after the number of them goes below a set number. He knew the goverment will likely get involed and made it so guns won&#39;t work in the building while the monsters try to do what they did to the students to the teams sent in. He then set it off after giving himself a waypoint to the exit and at midnight it will all reamaining monsters disappear along with all of the turned students sent to another world where the monsters came from if they are still in the building.<br />
<br />
Monsters appeared out of no where making many scream in surpise as they are attacked some dieing as others are raped. Dan grabbed Tiffa and pulled her along putting his pad in his bag. As the moving they saw monsters fight each other while more raped the students who were starting to transform.  Britney was one of them being turned into a cowgirl as she was raped by a Minotaur and Dan made a mental note to get her later. The two enter the hallways dodging monsters as they went for the two, other students, or other monsters. <br />
<br />
It was two long hours for the two of them but they got out finding themselves facing a camp set up by the police. They were brought in and checked over wounds patched up before being sent off to head home. Tiffa was picked up by her parents who thanked him for keeping their daughter safe and Dan walked home his mother out of town, his father was KIA in the Middle East. The knowledge of her him have him plan to have fun with her for she is hot.<br />
<br />
When he got home he got on the computer and got on the Chronivac and set it so he has fairly large home that is larger on the inside with 13 bedrooms and the number will increase if needed along with other types of need rooms. No vistors will notice and ask about it, or anything that happens inside even if he was fucking a girl in front of them, while those aside from him who live in the house will let it be and there will always be food stocked in the kitchens. Dan then went to his mother, he made it that she will act and look normal outside the house but inside will be a willing slave and deaged from 37 to 21 years old and will have real cat ears and tail on her. He then checked the list and had Britney brought to his home in her new form of 5&#39;6&quot; with two sets of DD-cup breasts, small horns on her head, hooves for feet, and a tail. He had a milking machine set up for her to be milked and it will be pleasureable for her. He also brought in Ms. Mary his homeroom teacher now a vixen anthro, Dawn and Sarah friends of Britney now cat anthros, and the school nurse Ms. Harris now a anthro wolf. He also made it so they had&#39;t gotten impregeated by the monsters.<br />
<br />
He sets it so any slaves older than 21 will be deaged to 21 and will not age any more while those younger than 21 will continue to age and till they hit 21 and then stop as well as Dan himself being affected when he hits 21. They will regain their minds but unable to leave the house, get help from vistors who will not see or hear them or try to call for outside help, and won&#39;t be able to hurt/kill him or damage his home or the items inside or try to kill themselves or others. They won&#39;t get pregeant from him fucking them unless he wills it and only daughters will be born for him to fuck when they hit 15. He did think of Tiffa but decided to leave her be for now. He also sets it so that what happened at the school will happen once a month at a random building some where around the world for he has plans. <br />
<br />
He watched the five look around seeing themselves still turned. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Where am I and why am I not normal again!&quot; Britney demanded. &quot;I beleave we all have the same question Britney.&quot; Mary told her. &quot;Because of me.&quot; Dan spoke up making them turn to him. &quot;You all now slaves to me and you are like that because I like them. Yes I did cause what happened at the school and no you won&#39;t be turned back to normal. You won&#39;t be able leave the house or get outside help or help from anyone who comes inside the house nor will they see whatever I do you in front of them and you won&#39;t be able to damage the house or anything inside or hurt/kill me or try to kill yourself or others.&quot; He tells them. <br />
<br />
They look at him in disbelief before Dan gets up and walk away to the living room and turns on the news which is covering the school. &quot;The National Guard has taken over from the police as they quarantine the building. From the reports given none of the monsters that had appeared has tried to leave the building but any teams sent in with guns are unable to get far due to something keeping them from working in the building.&quot; The male reporter says. Dan felt the air pass over his head and looked up to see Britney with a pan swinging at him only to go over his head. He shook his head at her as he looked at the TV again as the report continues endding with the note that all schools in the city will be closed for next months to be safe. He sits as he thinks of what to do next.</p>
