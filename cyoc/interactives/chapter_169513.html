Also I&#39;ve never been on a cruise so I may have some of the logistics wrong.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I sat in the car while my wife was inside with the boys. I’d have liked to be in there as well but I’ve been trying to distance myself from them in recent years. I didn’t want the shame of having a small-dick father looming over them as they grew older. Danny the eldest had made it easy. He didn’t ask for much and mostly kept to himself; a lot like me, but he at least appeared more confident. Chris my youngest on the other hand. Always outspoken and determined to get what he wants. I couldn’t help spoiling him of course. How could I say no to that adorable face? I hope for both their sake the small-dick gene skips a few generations. <br />
<br />
While I waited for my wife to say goodbye I read over the brochure again. This weekend had been my wife&#39;s idea, and a wonderful one at that. A cruise was the perfect way for us to spend our seventeen year anniversary. And best of all, when she had ordered the tickets, she informed me we had won a special &quot;Buy Two get One free&quot; offer for being the 1000th customer. I had asked if she wanted to invite one of her gal-pals along but my thoughtful wife had insisted we bring my younger brother Christopher. I was glad the two most important adults in my life had become such fast friends over the years. I think she’s hoping my sweet baby brother might finally find that special someone on this trip. I remember what it was like to be single and lonely. From the sound of it he’s had dozens of different partners just this year but can’t seem to hold one down for more than a night. Poor guy.<br />
<br />
I put away the brochure when my wife opened the passenger side door and climbed into her seat. I gave her a quick peck on the cheek, put the car in drive and we were on our way.<br />
-<br />
As I drove I began to reminisce about how I met my wife. Not every day you see a small-dick paired with a 10/10 hottie. I was a very successful businessman in my twenties. My lack of sex-life left me a lot of time to focus on my career. But as the years went by I began to crave intimacy with another person. Of course I was terrified of my secret getting out. I had managed to hide it for my entire life; not even my family knew I was a small-dick. As soon as I could afford it, the first thing I had invested in was several top of the line falsies, each one tinted to perfectly match my skin tone in case I ever accidentally revealed part of it, with secure fastenings so there would be no &quot;slip out the trouser leg&quot; mishaps and water proof so I didn&#39;t even have to take them off in the shower. They all individually had a variety of other features to realistically simulate a real man&#39;s penis in different ways so I wouldn&#39;t be exposed.<br />
<br />
But still I was desperate to feel real human contact with my penis at least once before I died. I figured if all I had was a big bank book to make up for my small spank hook; there was really only one way for me to lose my virginity without word of my hidden shame getting out. I hired a discreet high-class escort. Standard $500 fee plus a $500 small-dick surcharge. That $1000 bought me the most amazing ten seconds of my life. I tipped her an extra $500 on top. Best money I’ve ever spent.<br />
<br />
Of course when she called me a month later and told me she had fallen pregnant I did the honorable thing and offered to marry her. She insisted we got to know each other first. So we dated. I showered her with gifts, made sure she was taken care of and let her know I would work extra hard to provide for our family. She was very understanding when I expressed my concerns about the risk of any offspring I produce being small-dicks. But she was so deeply invested in us being together she was willing to endure a relationship without penile penetration from her husband. I would of course attempt to satisfy her in as many other ways as I could to make up for it.<br />
<br />
The wedding took a long time to plan. My son was three years old by the time we finally got married. My little brother and best man Christopher, agreed to babysit Danny for us so we could enjoy our wedding night. On that one special night, my wife and I had real sex for the second time since we met and so far the only time since we&#39;ve been married.  Five amazing seconds of pure joy, half as long but just as perfect as our first time. It was so beautiful; I cried.<br />
<br />
After we had finished, my wife went to my brother’s room to check in on Danny while I fell asleep exhausted. Such a caring mother. I think she stayed with him all night. All in all it was a wonderful wedding. Except I think my wife may have overdone it on the dance floor because she was limping the next day. But best news of all was despite using protection, that was the night our second child was conceived. I guess the little guy was just as stubborn then as he is now.<br />
<br />
We named him after my brother Christopher; A bit of a family tradition, as he and I were named after our father Daniel and uncle Christopher as well. My little brother is great with the kids of course. Chris has a lot of respect for his namesake. Sometimes I think Chris is more similar to Christopher than he is to me. And Danny in particular seemed to hold his uncle in particularly high esteem.<br />
-<br />
After half an hour we arrived at the port and found the gated parking lot. I made sure my falsie was secure before stepping out of the car and grabbing our bags. We headed for the terminal and after a short wait we were able to board. I was a bit nervous at the security check but my high quality falsie raised no suspicions during the pat down. Unfortunately I had to leave the one with functioning hydraulics that simulate erections at home because it would show on the metal detectors. One of my co-workers had been exposed at the airport that way while on a business trip with the boss. He&#39;s since become a bit of a joke around the office.<br />
<br />
My brother met up with us on deck with our room keys. He had offered to come early and handle all the admin since we were generous enough to bring him along for a free trip.<br />
<br />
“Bad news guys,” he said with a serious look on his face, “There’s been a mix-up with the accommodation.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, what’s wrong?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I checked out our rooms to make sure everything was in order, and it seems your couples room doesn’t have a double bed like we ordered. It has bunk beds.” Christopher explained. “I spoke with management, but unfortunately the cruise is completely booked. There are no other double beds available.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no that’s terrible.” my wife gasped. My heart sank. Was her vacation ruined before it even started?<br />
<br />
“Hang on, it’s not all bad news,” Christopher continued. “As compensation they agreed to upgrade my single to a first class cabin with an ocean view and full room service. Unfortunately it does still only have a single bed.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t see how that’s good news for us” I pouted.<br />
<br />
“Well big bro, since this whole trip was your wife’s idea, I think it’s only fair that she get the nice room while you and I bunk together.”<br />
<br />
My heart leapt. I’d have to find a way to thank my little brother for finding a way to salvage this trip.<br />
<br />
“Oh no you don’t have to give up your room,” said my wife considerate as always, “I wouldn&#39;t want to abandon poor Daniel on our Anniversary”<br />
<br />
“No honey he’s right! You should take the nice room, I want you to be comfortable.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I&#39;ll keep Daniel company,&quot; Christopher wrapped his arm around my shoulder and winked to put her at ease &quot;And you&#39;ll have plenty to keep you occupied this weekend, you wont even miss this dummy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded eagerly &quot;Go on honey, enjoy yourself.&quot; Of course I would’ve loved to spend the weekend together but I’m sure she’ll have a much more enjoyable time in a first class cabin than cramped into a bunk bed.<br />
<br />
“Well... if you insist.” my wife responded sounding hesitant as Christopher handed her the keys.  He then requested two nearby staff (who&#39;s uniform shorts left little to the imagination) to help her with her bags. As she walked away I slipped the lads a few extra bills and told them to make sure she was well taken care of. Watching them eagerly run after her, I was confident she would be in good  hands.<br />
<br />
“Well big bro I guess we&#39;re bunking together again, just like old times” Christopher leveraged the arm he had around my shoulder to pull me down and give me a noogie. I could feel the lump in his pants pressing against the back of my thigh. “Lets go check out our room.” <br />
<br />
He marched me down the ship to our cabin. First thing I noticed was it wasn’t very roomy. Typically when we go on vacation we’re use to more lavish accommodations I’m surprised my wife would book such an economic option. Maybe she was concerned with saving up for the boys&#39; college funds but really we we could easily have afforded something nicer. Christopher began to unpack while I tested out how firm the mattress was.<br />
<br />
As soon as he saw me touching the beds my brother yelled. “I call top bunk!” And proceeded to vault over my head, slapping me in the face with something on the way up. “Oh sorry bro.” he smirked down from above. I glared at him rubbing my cheek; even though we were in our forties, he was still so childish sometimes. Whatever I preferred the bottom anyway.<br />
<br />
“Hang on...&quot; I quickly averted my eyes when it finally sunk in that he was naked and his massive cock was the thing that had slapped me in the face &quot;Why the hell are you naked!?”<br />
<br />
“Oh just getting changed into something more suitable for-”</p>
