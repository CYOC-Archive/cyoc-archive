<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was practically a ritual at this point for Eli to jump on the scale in the morning and check his weight...but today, it seemed the ceiling was a bit closer than what he was used to. He&#39;d spent the last few nights enjoying the life of being a young, hot coach of a varcity team full of young, hot dudes. He had his pick of the women and twinks in the night life, and if anything the sheer amount of muscle he&#39;d been putting on had made him irresistible to the people out there. He even caught a few women from the teaching faculty eyeing him, the young stud frequently coming back in with the team sweaty and shirtless.<br />
<br />
But today it was 293 on the scale, and Eli was left wondering what had left him looking and feeling so incredibly young and virile lately. He swore, nobody in their forties looked like he did, felt like he did...fucked like he did. Eli was starting to wonder...but then, why question a good thing?<br />
<br />
So after making sure he had a nice and healthy meal, he head out as usual and scoped out his surroundings as he parked his car, observing the student body and more specifically those involved in his team;<br />
<br />
He saw Neil entering school, seeming to be in a rather odd mood today - he half seemed frustrated, but half seemed to be in an oddly good mood. Did his face look like it had filled in a bit? Eli swore it kinda did look like Neil was different if only slightly. He shrugged. There was always something about the bully on the team that had seemed off. Neil at first seemed to let his gaze fix on to both the cheerleaders and the toned, taut forms of his peers, before he suddenly snapped from that and into his bullying antics.<br />
<br />
Eli had wondered before, but Neil had made him stop thinking about him so much what with his misbehavior. Now though, with him looking different, it seemed his mind went back to those incidents. Maybe there was something there, some kinda repression or sublimation...ah, Coach Eli decided, he would see about that at practice. He did need to talk to Neil.<br />
<br />
By contrast it seemed like little Devin was in surprisingly good form today.<br />
<br />
The skinny nerd was striding from the front of the school to his first class. Seemed he had a doubtlessly good morning, and Eli wanted to say something, but he didn&#39;t want to interrupt Dev&#39;s vibe. So instead he found himself seeing that Devin&#39;s biceps looked a little bit better formed. Like he&#39;d been...lifting lately or something. But Eli was sure Devin did not like sports, so where would he be putting on muscle? The gym was a place of intimidation for the young guy...after all, it seemed it was mostly used around here by the football team.<br />
<br />
And of course there was the titan of the team, Gary, who seemed to have his own eye on the students and other athletes.<br />
<br />
Eli and Gary fistbumped, and Eli was left pondering after that when he got so informal with one of his students.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
That night, Eli was doing as he&#39;d wanted to do for some time.<br />
<br />
A winsome gay boy from the club was kissing at his right pectoral and rubbing at his muscles, and a beautiful woman from a different club was sucking his dick and feeling his strong, powerfully built quads and hamstrings. She even got her hands on his glutes, making Eli gasp and thrust his hips with pleasure.<br />
<br />
He was feeling pretty funny these days, but he didn&#39;t doubt that he was gonna enjoy this exercise of his burgeoning bisexuality. Eli knew he&#39;d probably need to come out to the teacher body, somehow, but he figured he could do that at his leisure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh yeah, let&#39;s see which of you is better at blowjobs.&quot; Eli said with a grin, and laid back to luxuriate in his sexual relief.<br />
<br />
He felt them licking and sucking at his dick, alternating between the two of them so he could compare. This was the fucking life!<br />
<br />
Eli was still feeling kind of odd, but it was quickly becoming a good kind of odd. He wanted more. And as he picked up the woman to have his way with her pussy, she of course teetering and urging him on, he looked back at the gay guy standing beside him, &quot;Fuck me in the ass, while I fuck her in the pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a commanding tone, like one he might use on the field, and Eli was feeling hot, young and ready to go. His muscles were taut, flexed it seemed from the exertion, and he knew this would be the release of a life time...<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Eli was at school the day after his threesome - he&#39;d set it to mind that he would do something like that again at the soonest possible juncture. But as time went on it was clear that they were coming up on a very important part of the year. Eli was almost envious. &quot;Haah...&quot; He said in line of earshot with Gary, &quot;What I wouldn&#39;t do to get to possibly train for and play college ball again. Cheerleaders there are the best lays...&quot;<br />
<br />
Not even thinking of what he&#39;d just said and what idea he might have planted, Eli reclined and thought about his recent conquests.<br />
<br />
He started to wonder. Gary was starting to look oddly older lately, and maybe it was just mostly the hair and stuff. But it was definitely odd. He hoped his star player wasn&#39;t gonna be exposed as some roid fiend. Even though it was probably not exactly surprising if true given Gary&#39;s build and the &quot;monster&quot; scare last month.<br />
<br />
Eli was starting to think.<br />
<br />
Neil was not exactly performing well on the team, and if things went so poorly in the next few weeks, he could kiss his spot on the team goodbye. But Neil seemed to be in an odd spot in terms of his behavior. According to some of the chatter Eli overheard, Neil was going out with a couple new girls, and almost seemed to be sexually overcharged. Even though his physique seemed to be slacking somewhat - he&#39;d put on weight. Though he definitely had not lost muscle mass.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Devin was in a really good place right now.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d seen Devin around the school trying to flirt. Mostly failing miserably, but the girls didn&#39;t laugh at him specifically, but more at his cheesy dialogue and lines. Hm, Coach Eli thought, maybe he could take Dev under his wing a bit. Show him how to go about this...</p>
