<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty knew of a guy at school named Rob. Rob was a big guy, 6'3 and 200 lbs of arrogant muscle. He was the same age as Dustin. When they were little kids, Rob and Dustin had been friends, then they became rivals. And more recently Rob had hit a major growth spurt, surpassing Dustin. Rob began to bully Dustin, in fact, most of the time Dustin picked on Ty, it was because Rob had been picking on him.<br />
Rob loved to compare their dick sizes in the school showers to see if Dustin's 8 incher had caught up with his massive 10 inch boner.<br />
<br />
Ty decided to wish Rob here now. Rob suddenly appeared, in boxers and an undershirt which he wore to bed. Ty wished that Rob would see him as a slightly older version of his normal self and not the hulking muscle god he had become. What Rob did see was Dustin standing there jerking off to his older brother's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin are you fucking gay?&quot; Rob asked with disgust. Dusting struggled to speak while unable to stop jacking off. Despite his attitude, Ty could see a bulge forming in Rob's pants. He searched Rob's mind and found something interesting and perfect.<br />
<br />
Rob was actually gay, and had been attracted to Dustin. He was confused which was why he was such a jerk. His secret fantasy was to totally dominate and fuck Dustin.<br />
<br />
Ty decided to make that happen. He silently wished that Rob would slowly gain more muscle and height, along with a bigger cock. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Rob continued to speak. &quot;Even if you are gay, you're brother? I mean I know he's got a bigger cock than you but if you really want a man to jack off to I'm standing right here.&quot; With that he pulled down his boxers to reveal his veiny boner. Ty's wish had already started and Rob's cock was now a foot long. &quot;You think Ty's buff, how about this.&quot; Rob flexed a biced and his white shirt sleeve ripped. Ty was impressed, apparently Rob could have ripped through his shirt before the growth. Rob flexed his other bicep and that sleeve ripped further than the other. He hit a most muscular and his shirt exploded. <br />
<br />
His pecs pushed outwards and formed deep groves, and his six pack form a solid ten pack. his shoulders widened and expanded while his arms swelled and were pushed away from his growing back. His muscular thighs tore through the lowered boxers and his massive cock and balls bounced. His feet expanded to balance his massive frame. Ty could see Rob's incredible muscle ass in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Ty now wished that Dustin would stop jacking off but become really attracted to Rob. <br />
<br />
Rob smirked as he realized he was growing and started jacking himself off. <br />
Dustin came over and started helping as well. Slowly Rob let go and started worshipping his growing muscles and Dustin continued ot worship his dick. Ty was becoming very aroused by this whole scene and was rubbing his enormous cock.<br />
<br />
Dustin then put Rob's swelling cock into his mouth and began to suck. Rob bit his lower lip.<br />
<br />
Ty decided he wanted some action so he lowered his illusion and let Rob see him as the giant muscle teen. When Rob saw him he just smiled and began thrusting into Dustins mouth. Ty swaggered over and placed his hardening cock infront of Rob. Despite his growth Rob didn't even need to bend forward to put the cock in his mouth. His head only came up to Ty's waist. Ty walked forward, forcing his massive prick down Rob's throat. He now stood with Dustin crouched below his huge balls, his cock in Rob's mouth and Rob's cock in Dustin's mouth. Ty began to thrust as well and soon worked up to a climax as he shot a giant load down Rob's throat, while Rob shot a smaller load into Dustin and Dustin finally came without even touchin his cock because he was so horny. <br />
<br />
As Ty pulled out of Rob his softening cock smacked Dustin in the head, knocking him out.</p>
