<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Billy decided he wanted to head out and see what kind of fun a fully grown, 24 year old man could have now that he was finished with this. He did however make sure to keep the Leeching Cube on hand. He did not want to have it end up in someone else&#39;s hands because he left it out. There was his brother to think about. However there was also the problem of his clothes. Billy knew that he&#39;d outgrown his 14 year old&#39;s clothes, and there was no way he could fit into any of them. But there was another option.<br />
<br />
His dad&#39;s clothes. Now Billy&#39;s dad did do some working out himself, but not nearly as much as Billy now looked to do. Once he was sure that his brother was off in video game land in his room and his parents were really gone, Billy snuck out and headed to his dad&#39;s room, dressed only in a towel that covered barely anything at all. It was large when he was 14, but so small when he was 24. Picking up one of his dad&#39;s old workout bags and stuffing the Leeching Cube in there, Billy started to pick out some clothes.<br />
<br />
What was fitting for his dad was still kinda tight on him now, but Billy did admit it was likely because of how muscular he was now. Fuuuuck, just looking at himself in the window&#39;s reflection made him feel like wasting a bit more time on taking care of himself again. But Billy wanted to go and enjoy his newfound mature body before he would have to turn back to boring old Billy.<br />
<br />
Dressing in a tank top and shorts from his dad&#39;s selection of gym clothes, Billy looked himself over. Not too loose, and tight in all the right places. He was gonna be a hit at the gym! Billy just had to try this body out and see how strong he was now in comparison to before. Sure he wanted to hang out with Luis, but the guy was just not up to speed yet. Maybe once Luis had experienced how it felt to be older.<br />
<br />
Before heading out, Billy made sure he had some water bottles, grabbed some of his dad&#39;s old shoes, and got ready.<br />
<br />
By the time he headed out, fully dressed and swaggering out, Billy noticed it seemed people regarded him much differently than when he was just some teenage kid. The neighbor woman next door instead of just ignoring him gave him this look that made Billy realize she...she might like him. It was a look that Katey had given him a few times before when the two were at lunch. Billy knew enough about girls to know that was a look that you got given when she was into you.<br />
<br />
Impulsively, Billy put up his arms and flexed. She seemed to appreciate this and looked at him a lot longer, blatantly checking out his arms. Because now, Billy actually had arms worth flexing. A cocky sneer started to show on his face as he looked forward to his experiences at the gym. There was this nice outdoor gym that he had heard of recently, and which he looked forward to making use of. Out in the sun, everyone either skimpy or shirtless... that&#39;d be the best place to show off.<br />
<br />
Billy noted that people in general seemed to respect him more, and he thought that if this was how he was being treated he kind of wondered what a bit more age might do for him...<br />
<br />
Ahh that was something to consider later! He was by now coming up on the gym. And he could see people walking around the outside establishment, a huge variety of equipment inside. Bench presses of various types, squat bars, many dumbbells and machines across the outside area of what had apparently once been a parking lot. Lots of very pretty girls here...pretty women that is. Billy, having never really had much of an opportunity for this kind of appreciation, found himself having to quell his libido yet again.<br />
<br />
He walked to the front and checked in with the guy evidently in charge of admissions. Billy noted he was impressively built, short cut, coiffed blond hair, and with bright blue eyes. The guy was tanned and toned, looked like one of those bodybuilder guys, and was wearing a brand tank top. &quot;Welcome to the gym, sir. I don&#39;t recognize you, so I&#39;m guessing this is your first time around here. Showers are inside the building to your right...&quot; He gestured to a repurposed old building that now looked refurbished and built back up, &quot;...And do you need any help with use of our machines and or weights?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy was used to the middle school gym, and being here in an actual full on gym, it was kind of overwhelming. &quot;Sir?&quot; Billy was interrupted mid-thought by this guy&#39;s speech.<br />
<br />
Billy responded, &quot;Uhh, yeah, sorry about that, I was just...I was distracted. Sorry about that.&quot; <br />
<br />
The guy seemed to nod in a weird way and then led the way over to a bench press machine that was just opened up. Billy had always been limited when he did bench press at school at least, so he had to compensate with more reps as opposed to more weight. Something about the school not wanting their young weightlifters to potentially &quot;hurt themselves&quot; by going overboard with weights. Home workouts were always a lot better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so this exercise I&#39;ll have you try out 185 lbs right now, and see where you are with that.&quot; The guy was just so built, almost as good as Billy&#39;s new body in some ways. Damn, Billy hoped he could get a shirt like that soon. It&#39;d probably really impress Katey.<br />
<br />
Getting on the bench press as the guy provided the weights, Billy was astonished by just how light the workout was. Being used to 135 lbs, he was rather surprised when he blew right past the guy&#39;s recommended ten reps, and went and did around 20 right off the bat. He could see his guide looking at him with an appraising look on his face. Was there something he didn&#39;t know? Billy just went ahead and did another set soon after, and got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy as can be!&quot; He shouted jubilantly, and did some stretching, feeling his chest and shoulders seemed tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very impressive Mr...er...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Billy Brand, thank you.&quot; Billy answered, figuring that with enough people in town it wouldn&#39;t be too unfeasible that there&#39;d be someone named Billy Brand who wasn&#39;t the moderately rich couple&#39;s teenage son. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Grayson Lansing, I work at the local high school as a phys ed teacher some times, and mostly work here as a personal trainer.&quot; Grayson said with a smile, looking Billy over. Damn this guy seemed to really like how buff Billy was. &quot;You really nailed that one. Let&#39;s up the weights on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before long Billy was hitting a 225 lbs bench press, much more than he had ever seen himself doing prior. He had been a little intimidated, but Grayson helped him get through it remarkably easy. By the end of the set, he&#39;d done 5 sets of eight reps at 225 lbs, and then finished with a much tougher 255 lbs 5 reps set. Billy found himself breathing roughly as he finished up the set, wondering if he could get even stronger.<br />
<br />
As he got up and did his stretches again, Billy felt on top of his game...and then he felt something. A feeling like someone slapping him on his ass. The feeling was sudden, it was surprisingly good, and he had not been prepared for how it felt. Billy flushed a little bit in the face and let out a soft moan from the feeling. He&#39;d never experienced that before! Billy looked over to a smirking Grayson. Billy bit his lip as he realized who was responsible for this.<br />
<br />
His body responded as it should at 24, starting to develop an erection from the stimulation. Billy looked at Grayson who was seeming to be playing more faux innocent now that he noticed Billy knew he did that, and then at his shorts. Billy felt like gasping. He was into Katey - and he was into women in general! But the way Grayson had done that had made Billy start to feel that same sensation from earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...need to take a break from the workout, Mr. Brand?&quot; Grayson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; Billy contemplated, looking at his erstwhile personal trainer. &quot;Why&#39;d you---why&#39;d you slap my ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it a problem I got hands on with your ass? It&#39;s a pretty good ass, not gonna lie.&quot; Grayson started and leaned closer to Billy, &quot;You feel like continuing to workout? Or do I need to help you out in the shower rooms to get you less wound up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy contemplated - he liked women, he was sure he did, but there was no question that Grayson&#39;s actions were inciting something in him. Maybe he needed to just go and see where this went. On the other hand, he could just go ahead and finish his workout...</p>
