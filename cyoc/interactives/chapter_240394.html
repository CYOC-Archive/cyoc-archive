<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katy made her way across the hotel, through the lobby, and finally to the back door with the pool in view.<br />
Sure, she was used to getting some looks, especially in her bikini, but she was definitely getting more looks than she was used to… it was a little exhilarating.<br />
She made her way outside, the water of the pools glistening in the sunlight. Katy looked around before finally finding Aimee beside two lounge chairs. She smiled, looking forward to seeing Aimee’s new reaction to her body.<br />
<br />
“Heyyy.” Katy said, Aimee quickly spinning around to look at her,<br />
“Took you long enough,” she said, shaking her head jokingly. Katy stood there… waiting for a reaction. There was an awkward silence between them, “what?” Aimee asked,<br />
“D-do you not, notice anything different?”<br />
“About you?”<br />
“Yeah.”<br />
“No… I think I’ve seen that top before, or is it new? You know I’m stupid…” Aimee continued,<br />
“N-no… no it’s nothing.” Katy said, a little defeated. How did Aimee not notice that was literally 100x more toned than this morning.<br />
<br />
Katy went about the routine, laying down her towel, taking off her crop top and shorts to reveal her bikini, accentuating her new toned body.<br />
“Yeah, I’ve totally seen that bikini before.” Aimee said, smirking. Katy had to ask again,<br />
“So you think I look totally normal… like nothing is different?”<br />
“Yeah? What did you do?”<br />
“I didn’t… I thought…” Katy couldn’t comprehend it. Sure, this ring was magic, but could it really change Aimee’s memory of her own body. She had to test it out further, “do you want a drink?” She asked,<br />
Aimee’s eyes perked up, “it’s like 10 in the morning… HELL YEAH!” She cheered, “I’ll totally regret it later, but could you get me a Sex on the Beach?”<br />
“Sure.” Katy chuckled. She pulled herself off the lounge-chair and threw on her sunglasses, beginning her walk to the bar.<br />
<br />
On the walk, Katy knew she wanted to experiment. Maybe her abs were too subtle, she didn’t have her belly out in the morning, so maybe Aimee was just too tired to notice. She needed to try something more obvious… she looked down.<br />
“Yeah, that’ll work.” She muttered to herself. <br />
Katy diverted her path back to the hotel entrance. She walked in and found several people walking around, a few families, a particularly pregnant woman, and several couples. She noticed they were all using the elevator to get up and down the floors, so she decided to try the stairwell.<br />
She opened the door, and found a slightly less clean and tidy room before a big set of winding stairs, “perfect.” She said, her voice echoing intensely.<br />
<br />
“Alright… I wish my boobs were bigger.”<br />
She waited excitedly, and as she anticipated, she found her chest becoming slightly more sensitive. She looked down, watching as her fairly below-average breasts started rising, growing like buns in an oven. They swelled, becoming fuller, rounder, filling out her bikini top. They stopped growing. She looked down, and found her B cups had transformed into a very modest pair of D’s. She couldn’t help but grin, she had so much power… and now she had tits!<br />
But she thought for a moment, if Aimee couldn’t tell that her best friend had gone from slightly pudgy to straight up toned, then she’d never be able to tell that her boobs had grown just two cop sizes.<br />
Katy grinned wider, she’d found a perfect excuse to make her boobs even bigger. With a big smirk, Katy said the magic words, “I wish my boobs grow even bigger!”<br />
<br />
She looked down, seeing her round breasts start swelling again. This time, it was a lot more intense. They swelled, getting fatter and heavier, their weight starting to make them form a teardrop shape.<br />
SWING!<br />
Katy heard a door swing open from just a floor above, “shit!” She said to herself, startled. She looked down, her breasts still growing. She didn’t want them to stop, but she didn’t want someone watching her grow. They continued, getting bigger and fuller, filling out more and more until they grew so big her bikini couldn’t cover it. Her right breast slipped out, continuing to swell, her nipples even looked bigger.<br />
“AH!” She screamed, not knowing what else to do. The footsteps stopped quickly, “d-don’t come down here!” She said. Her breasts were still growing.<br />
“So-sorry!” A male voice said from above. He quickly scurried backwards and the door opened and shut, the slam echoing everywhere.<br />
And as if on cue, her breasts stopped growing. She grabbed at them, feeling them. Her flesh pooling around her fingers, firm yet soft.<br />
<br />
She felt back for telling that guy to run away, but relieved she did so. She took her breast and stuffed it back into her bikini top. She looked down at them, feeling them, loving them. They were like… six times their original size,<br />
“I’m sure these are gonna kill my back later, but right now…” she said, grabbing both of them, “these are fucking awesome!”<br />
She stared at them, wanting to see them in full, “I wish there was a full-body mirror on this wall.” She said impulsively. And just like that, a shimmering metal began to phase out of the wall, transforming into a perfectly clean and smooth full-body mirror. She stared at herself, her breasts were absolutely massive.<br />
“God… I could go even bigger…” she said to herself, biting her lip. But she stopped herself, this was just for an experiment. But she did need to alter something, “I wish I had a cuter bikini that made these melons look even better… and actually sized properly!”<br />
And just like that, she felt the fabric of her bikini shifting. It shrunk thinner, becoming more triangle shaped, fitting perfectly around her large breasts. Even the bottoms changed, becoming side-ties.<br />
“God… I look amazing right now.” She said to herself.<br />
<br />
She opened the door, revealing herself to all the people walking about. And immediately she was caught by several glances, all staring right at her chest. <br />
She felt pretty awkward, but she wasn’t used to this much attention. She wanted to cover up… but then what was the point of going so big.</p>
