<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rene carefully manipulated Dan's flesh kneading it into his own, so that it looked natural.  He was now a head taller than before with broad shoulders, buff arms, sculpted pecs and abs, and buns of steel.  He grinned at his handiwork. He rifled through Dan's drawers and found some sweats that fit him like a glove.  He grinned at his huge obscene bulge, you could see the vein in his cock through the taut cotton fleece.  He adjusted his feet to fit Dan's sneakers, and started off for his own gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rene?&quot; asked the clerk at the desk as he examined the id card and Rene's new physique, &quot;Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say I finally had that growth spurt!&quot; he said with a wicked grin.  His grin widened as he saw the guy's eyes drop to Rene's crotch, and his mouth open.  Rene didn't know whether the guy was gay or if it was just plain penis envy, but either way he liked being noticed.<br />
<br />
Rene strutted into the gym, and started working up a sweat on the treadclimber facing a mirrored wall.  He grinned at his buff physique in the mirror, but frowned as he realized he didn't really have all those muscles.  Fortunately, rubberized Dan didn't weigh that much.  The added weight soon had sweaty damp patches on his back, chest, and underarms.  <br />
<br />
After the warm up, Rene headed over to the free weights.  For a wiry kid he was pretty strong, so he loaded up the weight bar, and hefted it up.<br />
<br />
Big mistake.<br />
<br />
At first he felt his arms stretching as he brought the weights up to his chest.  He realized his arms now would hang like a gorilla when he walked.  As he lifted the bar off his chest, he saw the concave indentation left in his chest by the bar. He now had the weight bar over his head, and he felt like he was getting shorter.  Glancing over at the mirror, in horror, Rene realized his legs were smooshing under the weight. Quickly he lowered the weights, and made a mad dash for the locker room.  This time he prayed no one would notice him.<br />
<br />
As he made his way down the hall, he paused as he recognized the sound of washers and dryers.  Earlier Dan had flattened him on a steam press.  He grinned, and said, &quot;Turnabout's fair play.&quot;<br />
<br />
He ducked into the laundry room.  Heaps of dirty towels covered the floor, and there was a basket filled with tablecloths from the massage tables.  They must have a press.  He looked around, no one seemed to be manning the laundry. Probably waiting for the next load to finish, he guessed.  He looked around and found a wringer press that was used for the massage tablecloths. He grinned as he shucked off his sweats.  His plan was to peel Dan off him, and then shock himself back into shape, and then to add Dan back on to his flesh.  <br />
<br />
He laughed as he looked down at his monster manhood, &quot;Dude, if your head of hair is going to be my pubes, I'm definitely going to have to get you a perm.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Rene shook off one leg of the sweats and a shoe, but he tripped trying to get the other one off.  Instinctively he reached out and caught himself on the wringer press.  His hand triggered the automatic feed and to his horror he found himself and Dan being pulled into the press.  He started to scream and call for help.  His finally plea was cut short as his head was rolled between the rollers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?  Did somebody call for help?&quot; the voice of the clerk echoed through the laundry room.  He started looking around, and as he was about to give up and put it down to a hoax, he saw Rene's gym clothes.  They didn't wash gym clothes here, only towels and linens.  He went over to investigate.<br />
<br />
He looked at the shoe, and sweat pants handing out of the wringer press.  The red light indicated that emergency shut off had engaged. The clerk pulled the pants and shoe free, and was shocked to see a human foot still trapped in the press. He went around to the other side of the press and found the flattened buff body of Rene lying there with his leg disappearing into the press.  The clerk stared for a moment and then pressed a button on the press.  The red light turned green, and the rollers started to turn.  In seconds a completely flattened Rene lay at the clerk's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my what am I going to do with you, Rene?&quot;  the clerk said rolling up the young man and Dan who was one with Rene's flattened muscles. &quot;I'm sure I'll think of something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rene and Daniel didn't like the sound of that, and they liked it even less when the clerk stowed the flattened duo in his gym bag with his dirty jocks, socks, t-shirts, and shorts.  The guy apparently waited until a week's worth of laundry was in the bag before he took it home to clean it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I've only got 4 more hours on my shift, then I'll take you out and we'll have some fun,&quot; the clerk promised as he zipped the bag shut.<br />
<br />
Rene racked his brains, what the heck was the guy's name?  Paul?  Jim? John? Mike? Dave?  Roger? Come on, he must have heard the clerk's name before, why hadn't he paid attention.  It would probably help if he managed to speak at some point, if he knew the guy's name that held him captive.</p>
