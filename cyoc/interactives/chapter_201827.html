<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two weeks had passed since his initial experiment.  Keen had now collected a substantial supply of samples with which to infuse his machine, and he had finally decided to test his &quot;product&quot;, on some patients.<br />
<br />
She sat, bound to an exam chair, gagged, with her head fastened in place by a leather strap.  She was rather plain looking.  5&#39;5&quot; and around 160lbs, ample breasts, fully nude with a little extra around the midsection.  Brown hair, not unattractive, but she didn&#39;t seem to try very hard either.  Along with a thick patch of hair over her pussy that spread a little to her inner thigh.<br />
<br />
She looked in horror as the doctor prepared whatever it was he was preparing.  He was so odd looking she almost believed it was a dream. <br />
 Massive breasts sat on his chest, completely visible as his lab coat was wide open.  His stomach however also sported a smaller second pair of breasts; though his face was still clearly male with thick stubble visible.  His little box on the table gave off a little steam as it did its work.  Keen then stepped towards her, brushing the hair off her sweaty brow, his tits rubbing against hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to make history my dear.&quot; He sniffed her neck, grabbing a handful of her breasts before kissing her shoulder.  She squirmed and moaned in her seat but it was futile.  &quot;Shhh... it will be over soon I promise, and, you won&#39;t have need to speak when we&#39;re done anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment later the fabrication box finished its work.  Keen took out the newly printed skin and turned towards his subject.  What was her name again, Karen?  Sarah?  Something like that.  Either way what he was about to do would obliterate whatever she may have been before today.  He stepped toward her, and held up the skin.  It looked like a mask.  A skin mask with holes for eyes and nose, but no mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful don&#39;t you think?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Again she squirmed in her seat, screaming through the gag.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see you don&#39;t appreciate what I have here.  You see, it&#39;s a new face.  It&#39;s your new face.&quot;  She stopped squirming.  Her eyes grew wide as he spoke, both in disbelief and horror.  He turned the skin around, showing the inside, which looked similar to the outside, but was slimy and moist.  &quot;I&#39;m going to give this to you as a gift.  The first of many gifts you will receive, and together we will make history.  But before I do, do you have any words you would like to make known?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmrrrmmph!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, let me take that out,&quot; and with one hand he removed the gag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, please don&#39;t, whatever you&#39;re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all?  Well I&#39;m afraid my dear, this has already been done.&quot;  With that he lowered the skin to her face, and the scream she let forth was deafening.  The leather strap barely keeping her still.<br />
<br />
She watched inevitably as the skin-mask was lowered onto her.  The eye holes fit perfectly, the nose slipped on.  But her mouth was quickly covered, and she could taste the liquid that lined the inside of the mask.  Still she screamed, until to her horror she slowly lost the ability to utter a sound.<br />
<br />
Keen watched as her screams died down and the coding in the skin took hold.  It fused to her face, seeping into her pores, and rewriting her DNA.  Just the thought of what was transpiring made him hard.  He took out his cock and straddled the exam chair, positioning himself accordingly before thrusting into her displayed pussy.  So much was happening to the woman before him, and now she was being fucked against her will.  He watched as she turned her head violently from side to side within the confines of the strap as the changes happened, but there was nothing she could do about it.<br />
<br />
She felt as her bones fused, her teeth and tongue dissolved away, her lips becoming one with each other, and her jaw completely locking into place.  Her voice box was gone, all that was left of her throat was a breathing tube with no need to swallow as everything that would make up a mouth vanished as though she never had one.  In a moment of clarity she opened her eyes and realized she was being fucked by this doctor at the same time.  <br />
<br />
He leaned towards her, his multiple breasts caressing hers, licking her ear before whispering, &quot;This is just the beginning my sweet.  Oh the places we will go.&quot;  A hand clamped over the skin that replaced her mouth, and his thumb massaged the area briefly just before he tensed up, and came inside her.<br />
<br />
Still strapped down there was little else she could do but lose herself in her own thoughts.  Keen leaned in after his orgasm subsided and kissed the blank space on her face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You are so beautiful.&quot;</p>
