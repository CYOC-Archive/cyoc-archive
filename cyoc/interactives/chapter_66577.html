<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mage's astral form left the Perkins' household, it accelerated until it reached the outer most edges of the <br />
Earth. Tony stared at the big blue marble that he was destined to protect and serve, and after admiring the <br />
wonder of it all, he turned around and focused his will until he was once again on the ninth plane. His spirit <br />
then floated all throughout the esoteric, ephemeral weirdness of it all until he eventually found the spot <br />
where he hid his own body. Gazing upon it briefly like how he gazed at the Earth moments ago, he then jumped <br />
into it. His body then immediately leaped up from it's slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does that always feel like jumping into a cold shower?&quot; thought Tony out loud. Breathing slowly and <br />
deeply to calm himself, Tony stood back up when he felt a vibration from somewhere in his pants. &quot;How embarrassing&quot; he said. After a few moments, he got his mind out of the gutter and realized that it was his <br />
cell phone. Reaching into his jean pocket, he pulled it out and pressed the icon for listening to voice mail.<br />
<br />
For anyone wondering why Science Master's phone message had reached the ninth dimension, let it be known that <br />
he enchanted it to work anywhere. No matter what planet he was on, dimension he was in, or whatever eldritch <br />
horror was currently in the area, he would get percent phone coverage.<br />
<br />
The voice mail went like this: &quot;Dr. Mage, this is Science Master.&quot; Fiendish laugh. &quot;I have Lacey here at my <br />
lab. I think she should make quite a good subject for some experiments I have in mind. I've always wondered if <br />
its actually possible to graft a human head onto the body of an octopus. I'm going to knock off for an hour <br />
and then start. You're welcome to try and stop me, of course, but I warn you your puny tricks are no match for <br />
the power of SCIENCE!&quot;  <br />
<br />
After ending the message, Doctor Mage put the phone back in his pocket, and all the blood suddenly drained <br />
from his face.<br />
<br />
No, I'm just kidding. He started chuckling loudly to himself. Science Master? Who the hell was this dork that <br />
still thought it was the Silver Age? Mage had the feeling that after he put Science Master in a place where <br />
the sun don't shine, he would have to have a long talk with this guy and straighten him out. Maybe have him <br />
work on the cure for cancer, or create hyperspace travel...or something.<br />
<br />
Mage breathed in slowly and deeply, preparing himself for the upcoming battle, and reentered our dimension <br />
once again.<br />
<br />
He reappeared in his room, and remembered that the cops were still looking for him. In fact, he could hear his <br />
mom and dad right down the hall lying to them about how they haven't seen their son since this morning. That <br />
warmed his magical little heart a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap. Oh well, I'll just have to convince the commissioner later that I'm innocent.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wave of his hand, he homed in on the location of the Lau's and Science Geek, and then with a pop, <br />
teleported there. <br />
<br />
It was a regular suburban home, one that you might pass by and not give a second thought...if not for the <br />
front door being wide open. A trap. A trap a ten year old could figure out was a trap. But Mage had no choice. <br />
He stepped into the great beyond that was the front door. The living room was dark, and personal items such as <br />
clothing were strewn around the room. <br />
<br />
Mage's senses suddenly tightened, but before he could turn around and react, he was struck in the back with <br />
lightening bolts. Screaming in pain, Mage fell to the ground, his mystical auto-shields that were supposed to <br />
make him virtually invincible to all Earthly weapons somehow failing him. Before he passed out, he looked <br />
around to get a good look at who did this to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was his doppelganger. His lookalike. His twin. It was Science Master's robot double of Mage, the one who <br />
burned down the Lau's household and brought them here. For every magic power in Mage's possession, the robot <br />
had a mad science equivalent of it. He was Mage's equal but opposite in every way. He picked up Mage, and <br />
brought him down to the basement...where his Science Master was waiting.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Was that a dream in the midst of a nightmare? Kylie couldn't tell. She was having such an awful time trying to <br />
get away from &quot;Kyle&quot;, that she would have grabbed onto anything to get away from him. But in her heart of <br />
hearts, she really did believe that Doctor Mage had come to visit her in her sleep. He was a hero after all. <br />
How many times had he and Wonder Gal saved the world in the last few years now? She even found him to be kind <br />
of cute looking, as much she was loath to admit it. But now the nightmare was back, pushing her buttons and <br />
prodding her to use her power for evil. Was he serious about this? Did she really have magic powers? <br />
<br />
Someone at Kylie's door started knocking softly but firmly, and then opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie?&quot;<br />
<br />
This woke her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Oh my god, I had this terrible nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie's mom looked at her daughter with sympathy, and proclaimed, &quot;Well, there's someone here to see you. <br />
Maybe he'll make you feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler stepped forward from behind Kylie's mom, and came in his sick girlfriend's room to sit beside her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you feeling any better?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, although the migraines have gone away.&quot;<br />
<br />
(After Kylie fainted during the graduation banquet, she was taken to the hospital by her parents. The doctor <br />
in the emergency room found several problems, one of which was a steady stream of migraines. Kylie had never <br />
experienced such a problem before.)<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kylie's head started twisting around her body 360 degrees, Exorcist style, while spewing green pea <br />
soup from out of nowhere all around the room like a water sprinkler. Tyler had caught a good deal of it on his <br />
face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon. Soon I will be free to wreak havoc!&quot; screamed Kylie at the top of her lungs in a tone that she was <br />
never heard speaking with before.<br />
<br />
Inside Kylie's mind, Kyle was rolling on the &quot;floor&quot; laughing. &quot;Soon&quot; he said to Kylie.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Animus was frustrated. Frustrated at Science Master's nanobots. Frustrated at his magic being noneffective <br />
against Wonder Gal- he couldn't even influence her mentally. Frustrated at Wonder Gal and Doctor Mage. He <br />
remembered being at that party, having to feign remorse when he was completely justified in what he was doing. <br />
Soon. Soon he would have his revenge. <br />
<br />
&quot;But if Wonder Gal will not be turned, she will be destroyed.&quot; He always wanted to say that, even if no one <br />
was there to listen to him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Michael the dog suddenly jumped on Laura, knocking her over on the floor. She was still struggling <br />
against the nanobots, and the frustrated look on her face and the sweat on her brow revealed how hard she was <br />
fighting against them. Michael was in a daze, barking loudly, licking her face and in his own doggish way <br />
demanding to be fucked.<br />
<br />
Outside, people suddenly dropped what they were doing and ran to Laura's door, banging on it wildly. Fights <br />
broke out as all the men in the neighborhood tried to break the door. In a daze, they all demanded to be the <br />
father to Laura's children.<br />
<br />
Animus sat back and smiled, invisible to everyone.</p>
