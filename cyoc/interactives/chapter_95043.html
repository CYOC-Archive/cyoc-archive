<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Come on, dude!” Keith urges you, still standing stark naked in the middle of the parking lot, hunching over to cover his dick with his hands, “Gimme my clothes back before they lock me up for public indecency or something!” <br />
<br />
You look at the keys in your hand, which have just turned your old Fiat into a brand new Chevrolet corvette and made your friend Keith’s grubby clothes disappear into thin air. <br />
“You know, I can’t guaranty that you get your old clothes back....judging from what happened with my car, these things might dress you in almost anything...” <br />
<br />
“Don’t care!” Keith snaps back, “Just do something!” <br />
 <br />
“Alright...here goes nothing,” you say as you point your keys at Keith an press the unlock button again. <br />
<br />
Just as you predicted, Keith does not regain his shorts or his tattered Pink Floyd shirt, however nor does he gain any other sort of attire. Instead it’s his body that undergoes a transformation. <br />
 Just as the frame of your fiat stretched out into a luxury car, so Keith’s skeleton starts to stretch....he grows taller, inch by inch, until he reaches the impressive height of 6’5’’<br />
As he grows like that he also becomes broader; his shoulders pushing out, his hands and feet becoming bigger and manlier...his dick gaining inches and girt, though you don’t get a close look at it as Keith instinctively shifts his posture to cover it again, with his new, huge hands. The fat on Keith’s belly melts away as his mass redistributes along his taller frame; the muscles on his arms gaining definition, bulging out against his skin, his calves and thighs becoming lean and hard, his torso becoming a perfect “V” shape with large, beautiful pectorals and an impressive sixpack emerging from underneath his dissipating gut. <br />
By the time the transformation is finished, your buddy Keith could be mistaken for an underwear model, his face however still has the same, kind blue eyes, grubby, blonde hair and beard stubbles. <br />
<br />
Your mouth hangs open as you look at Keith, then down at the keys in your hand, and back at Keith...so these things could change living things as well? You blush as you look at Keith’s new frame, beautiful and lean and hot and feel your pants tightening over your crotch. <br />
<br />
Keith, oddly enough, seems to be oblivious to the changes in his body. “What are you waiting for?” he asks, surprising you with his new deeper voice, “gimme my clothes back before someone sees me naked out here!” <br />
<br />
“They might react more favourably than you think...”  you almost tell him as you stifle a laugh, “Keith, you should....”<br />
<br />
He stamps his new, large foot, “Now!” <br />
<br />
You grow worried, those keys seem unpredictable, you didn’t want to accidentally turn Keith obese or into a midget, or 80 years old...<br />
“Dude....” <br />
<br />
“NOW!” he bellows again, his voice just so commanding and booming that you find yourself obeying against your better judgment.  Pointing your keys at Keith you press the unlock button again, squinting, afraid what might happen...<br />
<br />
...your fears prove ungrounded; Keith retains his new, lean frame instead a long roll of red cloth, glinting and glittering in the sunlight materializes out of thin air and wraps itself tightly around Keith’s torso and legs. The cloth reshapes, straps wrapping themselves around Keith’s shoulders as two bits separate from the cloth and travel down to his feet and become shoes...scarlet red high heels to be precise and soon Keith is dressed in a slinky, low-cut evening gown made of red sequins and matching heels.  <br />
The sight of Keith’s manly, muscular frame wrapped in that dress and his huge feet straining against the containment of the high heels causes you to burst out in laughter. Why, he now even wears a clunky ruby necklace and matching earrings!<br />
<br />
As you laugh Keith loses his balance in the high heeled shoes, quickly stepping out of them as he almost falls over. <br />
“The fuck?” he hisses between his teeth as he looks down at himself, plucking at one of the strings that fix the dress to his shoulders and pulling at one of his earrings. He looks at you, his eyes narrow “You think this is funny? I look like a fucking tranny!” <br />
<br />
You can hardly stop yourself from laughing enough to answer “I...I told you,, I couldn’t control what kinda clothes these keys give you...” <br />
<br />
“Well,” Keith demands , striking a rather ladylike gesture as he puts his hands on his hips, “try again!” <br />
<br />
You chuckle again about Keith’s feminine stance as you once again point the keys and “unlock.” <br />
<br />
The dress transforms, changing colour;  the upper part fades from red over orange and yellow, settling to a soft, olive green, while the lower part becomes first purple, before fading from indigo to a greyish light blue., the discarded heels melt to a first pinkish, then white goo that slowly slinks towards Keith, now naked, feet. The dress separates along the colour divide; the olive part becoming a tight-fitting v-necked t-shirt, he lower part, the skirt melting and reforming into a pair of blue jeans, hugging Keith’s granite hard butt and bulging crotch like they were spray painted onto him. The two white blobs encase his huge feet and reform into brand new trainers.  The ruby necklace and earrings melt from Keith’s ears and neck, meeting in his face and wrapping themselves around his eye line as they darken to a pair of black sunglasses. <br />
Keith flips the sunglasses up and looks down at himself, smiling “That’s better,” he tells you, “though you owe me a Pink Floyd T-shirt...”       <br />
<br />
While Keith seems satisfied with the results you can’t help but feel....disappointed?  After the spectacular changes your car has went through and the slinky dress you were hoping for something...well, flashier than a t-shirt and jeans. It definitely looked better than what Keith had been wearing before but....biting your lip you press the, unlocking button again.<br />
<br />
Keith outfit melts again, all the articles merging to form a homogenous, black mass that reforms into priest’s robes, including a stiff, white collar around Keith’s neck.  <br />
While Keith is still too startled by this to react you press the key again, and again, and again. <br />
In quick succession Keith’s clothes transform into a soldier’s uniform, a stereotypical 50’s biker jacket and jeans, a soccer uniform, a Scottish kilt and many more. You find transforming his clothes almost addictive...the surprise of what the next outfit would be, Keith’s reactions, it’s hilarious! <br />
<br />
As you press again Keith’s current cowboy outfit melts into a greyish black mass. Wrapping tightly around him as it reforms into a classy, expensive looking, black three-piece suit and tie.  Keith’s brown booths shrink to dress shoes made of shiny black leather, the Stetson on his head darkens to match his suit and reshapes into a trilby. Keith’s huge hands instinctively curl as a shiny black substance oozes over them from his wrists, encasing his palms and each finger into skin-tight, black leather gloves, tucked into the sleeves of his dress shirt as if he had no intention of putting them off anytime soon. A single white stripe appears across the length of Keith’s new suit, right above his heart, going vertical from his lapel to his trouser seam. The stripe lights up and multiplies, spreading out left and right and adding a pinstripe pattern to Keith’s suit. Finally to top it all off a black, silk pocket square appears  in Keith’s breat pocket, dressing him to the nines.  <br />
Keith looks down at himself in irritation, flexing his hands uncomfortably in the tight leather and tearing the hat from his head. <br />
“Stop that!” he shouts at you, “I’m not some effing dress up do....” <br />
<br />
Keith’s voice dies as you press the unlock button again. Your heart skips a beat as it is not Keith’s clothes that change, but instead the only part of him not covered by clothing....his head.<br />
Your body freezes in place as his head becomes...blurry, as if hidden behind a censor layer on TV. It’s only a split second as the yellow colour of Keith’s hair is replaced by pitch black and as the blurry “effect” disappears, it is a stranger that stands before you.<br />
You feel yourself tense up as you notice how everything, absolutely everything  about Keith’s face has changed;  the first thing you notice is that Keith’s messy, blonde hair has not only darkened to black, but grown shorter and is now neatly pomaded. Similarly Keith’s kind, blue eyes have darkened and now stare like cold, hard stones from underneath elegantly arched eyebrows, so dark brown that they seem almost black. Keith’s skin has taken on an olive tone, Italian...an impression that is only strengthened y his new, aquiline nose and prominent, manly chin. <br />
Keith’s full lips curl into a smirk with something you have never seen on him; arrogance. His whole body language changes, becoming more erect...confident as he puts the trilby back ovr his pomaded hair and starts to smooth the creases out of his gloves. <br />
<br />
You stare at what you hope, pray is still your friend, it is several moments before you gather the courage to speak to him, “Keith?” <br />
<br />
The man looks at you, the harness of his eyes almost knocking you over as his smirk grows even wider. <br />
“No,” he says with a new, husky voice as he shakes his head and starts to walk towards you, “not anymore, buddy”  he adds and chuckles, “the name’s Vinny now, Vinny Fontano. Good ol’ Keith went bye-bye. And to make sure it stays that way....” Vinny reaches into his jacket retrieving a handgun from it. The shiny black tendril of his thumb removes the safety from the gun, producing a clicking sound as he points it straight at you, “You better gimme those keys, if ya know what’s healthy for ya...” <br />
<br />
A cold shower rushes over your back as you stare at the gun in Keith’s...or rather Vinny’s....hand and then up n the face of the man that has replaced one of your oldest, closest friends.  You don’t understand...is Keith really, truly gone? Poof? Disappeared? <br />
“My fault!” you think as there’s a sharp pain right at the core of your being; you did this to Keith, you turned him into this brute in front of you...  <br />
<br />
“You’re deaf, buddy?” Vinny hisses as he flicks his gloved fingers, “ keys over here or I’ll put more holes into ya than a noodle sieve!”</p>
