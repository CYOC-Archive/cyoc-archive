<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So these Dinotopians will be getting their own colony city?&quot; asked a female Echidna Animalian as she sat in a chair in one of the examination rooms at Horizon, with her mate seated beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly as he looked between her and her mate, &quot;Some things won&#39;t really progress until later... Animalia Ambassadoria can&#39;t cover and review it directly right now, as while the Seniors may have graduated by now, the underclassmen still have to wait until closer to Memorial Day before they get out... but that isn&#39;t too far away now which will surely be welcomed by those that aren&#39;t graduating this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Echidna Animalians nodded and sat on the plastic chair that was offered them. Occasionally when they moved, Doctor Stein could hear their spines scrape and scratch against the plastic which did have a rough sound. And that was something to be expected, as contrary to how Sega portrayed echidnas in video games, the animal had spines that covered their dorsal side from head to tail. The two could wear some standard clothing, though initial testing had shown that just like with hedgehog and porcupine Animalians, if the clothing was too tight or the fabric was too soft, those spines could punch through.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that Horizon had questions on, particularly with what Ben and Tyree had sent with their email when these two were uplifted was on the development of an egg that the female Echidna Animalian, Eva, had laid shortly after her uplifting. The egg had hatched before Mother&#39;s Day and there was now a fair amount of question and concern as to whether or not the baby Echidna was still a mundane animal or was actually an Animalian. That was always something that came off as tricky, particularly with Animalians that had been uplifted rather than converted. People could tell that Sarah and Malice&#39;s siblings, Belle and Bash, were Animalians because of the presence of human hair that carried over from the fact that their parents were converted Humans, which made Belle and Bash&#39;s Animalian status rather obvious. <br />
<br />
But Eva and her mate Carson presented a different case. For one thing, they were uplifted Animalians and it seemed as though they were uplifted just before Eva would have laid her eggs as a mundane Echidna. That second factor was the biggest tipping point in analyzing things, for as Monotremes, mammals that laid eggs, Echidnas were not like other mammals. There had been one or two cases in the initial outbreak some new Animalians were pregnant when uplifted, but when the offspring were born the newborns were also Animalians. Horizon surmised that because those cases had involved placental mammals, the unborn infants absorbed the Animalia Virus from their parents and in the protection of their mother&#39;s womb that counted for one dose. It had been that reason that had lead to the development of the vaccine against the contagious aspects of the Animalia Virus when Animalia began. However, as a Monotreme, Echidnas would have that connection. Eva and Carson&#39;s baby was in an egg that had not been laid when they were uplifted which then lead to the question as to whether or not the Animalia Virus could go through egg shells. <br />
<br />
It was that sort of thing that had been the focus of the present tests, which Doctor Stein had to compare with blood samples that Eva and Carson also provided. The two Animalians looked to him as their thoughts drifted back to before Mother&#39;s Day, earlier in the month...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The zoo that Ben and Tyree ran wasn&#39;t very big, and when compared to Australia Zoo, many had described it as second tier. Though both Ben and Tyree had figured that was more due to the fact that they were essentially competing against a zoo that had a long history of animal conservation and brand was known the world over. Their small zoo might get some more attention with the two of them becoming Thylacine Animalians, as it was something that Animalia generally had that a fair number of people seemed to have interest in, regardless of the type of Animalian. Even if the people in question didn&#39;t have plans to convert, there always seemed to be people that wanted to meet and see an Animalian.<br />
<br />
But some things largely progressed slowly, as while Australia&#39;s government was perfectly fine with people converting if they wished to and didn&#39;t necessarily oppose Animalians immigrating to Australia, provided Australia&#39;s laws were followed, they weren&#39;t as eager or supportive of allocating land for a colony in Australia. Some of this was very familiar, as after their conversions they did keep track of some things. The Dinotopian Colony in Texas had had some delays in construction related to pre-existing property owners who didn&#39;t want to sell to allow for the construction of the colony city between Glen Rose, Texas and Dinosaur Valley State Park and other attractions in the area. Egypt had had some concerns over archeological developments when New Zerzura was established, and so on. This meant for the Australian &quot;colony&quot; that if there was to be a single &quot;colony city,&quot; Ben and Tyree would either A) need to use land they already owned or B) get the financial backing to get a landowner to build on that land. <br />
<br />
Neither of which was easy. So far they had been able to fund the construction of a small cabin on the zoo grounds and had plans to uplift a pair of Short-Beaked Echidnas that were in the zoo&#39;s collection and were essentially rescued from someone that had been trying to keep them as pets. In this, while Ben and Tyree knew the species, they couldn&#39;t quite be sure on the age of the two. Though they guessed they were older, as the zoo had others of the same species that were legally held for education purposes that were known to be much younger. As such it was figured to uplift the older pair and let them work to help with the zoo&#39;s educational programs regarding Australia&#39;s native wildlife and with Monotremes like the Echidna in particular.<br />
<br />
Thus the two waited in the veterinary area of the zoo with one Horizon scientist and the zoo&#39;s staff vet as one of the keepers brought in a modest sized pet carrier. Ben and Tyree could hear the sounds of scurrying coming from within the carrier.<br />
<br />
&quot;They seemed a mite jumpy when we came for them,&quot; the keeper reported, &quot;almost like they didn&#39;t want to go in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They weren&#39;t hurt, were they?&quot; Tyree asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but we did have to bait them into the carrier and then they got skittish when they realized they were being moved,&quot; the keeper answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may best if you two stay back, sir, ma&#39;am,&quot; the vet spoke, &quot;they may have seen you during some of your walk throughs to check the zoo, but I&#39;m not sure as to how well they&#39;ll recognize the scent of a predator that&#39;s been extinct for quite some time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben and Tyree both nodded stepped back toward the back of the room while the keeper placed the container on one side counter while the Horizon scientist prepared the first dose of the Animalia Virus. With concern over doing harm to the two Echidnas, it was decided to give them their doses of the Animalia Virus with water to drink. The zoo&#39;s staff had provided one small metal bowl that was used with the Echidnas and it was hoped that the two that were to be uplifted would drink from it, similar to how the virus initially spread in Lyre/Animalia. The metal bowl was then placed on the examining table as the keeper carefully carried the live Echidna to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, Eva,&quot; the keeper softly, even as the Echidna did its best to curl into a ball, &quot;this shouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The keeper placed Eva down on the table and then let go. With Eva curled up in a ball, it was not likely that she would drink until she could uncurl herself, and that wouldn&#39;t happen until she felt &quot;safe.&quot; After a few moments of not feeling any pressure on her, Eva uncurled and looked around. She saw two tall dog-like things standing two legs further back and a few people in the room, but they weren&#39;t super close. What she did find close to her was the water bowl which she slowly approached. After a few looks around the room, she then lowered her mouth to drink from it.<br />
<br />
Ben and Tyree watched quietly as the Echidna drank from the water bowl. Almost immediately as it drank they could begin to see changes. The first thing was that Eva began growing larger. She went from being small enough to be able to be carried in the palms of one&#39;s hands to being the size of a small dog and then began to grow further. As this happened, Eva&#39;s forepaws began to grow longer and wither her finger bones growing longer. Her claws stayed the same, proportionately speaking, but her paws became far more hand-like, complete with fingers and opposable thumbs. Her feet and legs went through a similar change. Her feet were largely still plantigrade, but they were a bit longer, and her legs grew much longer. It was such that she fell to her knees rather than standing on all fours for the moment, and knocking the water bowl off the examining table and onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;That stuff won&#39;t be a contaminant for the other animals, will it?&quot; the vet said the Horizon staff member.<br />
<br />
&quot;At present, yes...&quot; the Horizon scientist said, &quot;but we&#39;ve found that with things like water... basic disinfectants and cleaning methods will actually kill the Animalia Virus. The real thing will be in vaccinating her once her transformation is complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her?&quot; the keeper asked, &quot;how...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that a rather husky moan was heard making the keeper look up and seeing the vet in some degree of shock and surprise as the Echidna&#39;s hips widened and took on a far more Humanoid shape, and almost as wide as Tyree&#39;s hips. Ben and Tyree also watched as two round mounds began to grow on her chest. At first they were still covered in the Echidna&#39;s brown fur, but as they swelled larger and got more sensitive, and drawing Eva&#39;s hands to them, Tyree could see a small nub pushing forward on each growing breast. It was their growing size and sensitivity that had made Eva moan, and it was enough of a distraction that neither Ben, Tyree, nor the vet noted that Eva&#39;s stomach had pushed forward slightly. Not much and not flabby. It was in fact rather firm, but the final point of Eva&#39;s transformation was a bit distracting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step back!&quot; Tyree urged to the Horizon scientist and her vet, &quot;just in case...&quot;<br />
<br />
At that point, Eva actually squeezed at her breasts a little and was surprised to see a small spray of milk come from the little nubs that poked through her fur. The stream thankfully missed the vet and the Horizon scientist, which was Tyree&#39;s intent. After a few moments, things seemed to calm down a bit and Eva settled a little bit and sat back on the examining table with her legs straddling it. It showed a bit more than what some might have hoped for, but with Eva newly uplifted there was probably some degree of confusion as Eva&#39;s brain processed things.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was strange,&quot; Eva said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Ben spoke, &quot;You were uplifted to become an Animalian... an anthropomorphic animal. In your case based off of the Short-Beaked Echidna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are Dog Animalians?&quot; Eva asked to Ben and Tyree, noting their rather canine like faces and not seeing the striping on their fur coats, as that was covered by their fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re Thylacines, actually,&quot; Tyree answered, &quot;wolf-like Marsupial that went extinct in the early thirties. My fiancé and I volunteered to bring it back as part of Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Eva said slowly. She knew what Marsupials were, though she&#39;d never heard or seen of a &quot;Thylacine&quot; before. However a twinge in her nether region soon brought on different issues. &quot;I&#39;m afraid though that my questions must wait... I&#39;m... I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
At first it was thought that Eva might have had some sexual related side effect from the uplifting process, but Eva&#39;s voice actually sounded more pained than pleasured. She leaned back for a moment on the examining table, supporting her weight on her arms and then gave a bit of a pained grunt. To everyone&#39;s surprise, a small white rubbery egg was pushed out through her cloaca. The organ&#39;s shape was a bit different than how it would be on a mundane Echidna, though that might not be unexpected with an Animalian. The real surprise had been that Eva had just laid an egg, something many zoos seemed to have trouble with in that captive Echidnas weren&#39;t always interested in breeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was unexpected,&quot; the vet said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a mother,&quot; Eva said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That we can see,&quot; the Horizon scientist said slowly, &quot;Horizon may have some questions and concerns with the study with your child... to see if uplifting you uplifted your child as well... and with that provide it the best medical care that can be managed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though we&#39;ll want to uplift your mate as well,&quot; Tyree added.<br />
<br />
Eva nodded and uplifting Carson followed much the same pattern and went just as well. Though the questions on their child remained...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And Eva and Carson did agree with the concerns they were told. The egg Eva had laid was larger than what a normal Echidna&#39;s egg would be, but not by too terribly much. It was also noted not to be as big as some of the other Animalian eggs that had been noted, those this was also something that was noted those were either reptilian or avian. Echidnas were mammalian and there could be some question that their eggs would be different from bird or reptile eggs. And while their little puggle had hatched and was presently safe and secure in Eva&#39;s pouch for the moment, there was the wonder and concern as to whether or not the uplifting had worked with the puggle or not. That was one of the things that had brought them to Lyre and Horizon&#39;s main labs.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Doctor Stein... what can you say on our puggle?&quot; Carson asked after a moment, turning the conversation from some of the loose references to the Dinotopian colony in Texas to why they were there, &quot;Did Eva&#39;s uplifting also uplift our little one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I believe she is a bit small from what experience we&#39;ve had with Animalian children... particularly those from the species that would lay eggs,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;but given that you were pregnant when you were uplifted, Eva, I&#39;m not sure that comparison would work. For should you and Carson breed again... your next egg might be bigger than the one you laid after being uplifted. And from what I got from Ben and Tyree, their vet, and the member of Horizon&#39;s staff sent down to help them with regard to any actions related to a possible Australian colony... the egg you laid was actually bigger than what an Echidna&#39;s egg would normally be. In that, it&#39;s quite likely that the Animalia Virus had some effect on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But will she be an Animalian... or a larger than average Echidna?&quot; Eva asked nervously.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein gave a deep breath, &quot;the blood tests we&#39;ve taken would indicate that your child is an Animalian... that the Animalia Virus can go through the egg shell and essentially uplift the child inside it. Though, given how close you likely were to laying your egg naturally, there wasn&#39;t enough material for your egg and your child to grow to match your growth. However, now free of the egg shell, it should be able to grow without restriction... Though whether or not your child will equal your size will yet to be seen. She may end up being a bit smaller than you, as a result of being smaller than what would be expected... or she could have a great growth spurt once her spines start coming in. That we&#39;ll have to wait and see on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as she&#39;s safe,&quot; Eva smiled.</p>
