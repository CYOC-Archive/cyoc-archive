<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{Our episode title is also a great song, first sang by Otis Redding.—tmw.}<br />
<br />
The Andersons finished dinner in what for most households would be considered normal fashion, even if the family wasn&#39;t comprised completely of weres.<br />
Conversations about how everyone&#39;s respective day went (at least before Eric was attacked by his Algebra teacher), what their plans for the rest of the evening were, upcoming events of note, and other such mundane subjects were discussed.<br />
After dessert (chocolate meringue pie) was finished, Eric and his older brother Nate asked if they could be excused to tackle their respective homework assignments.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Martha.<br />
Their mother looked on as her boys went upstairs to their respective bedrooms.<br />
Eric was confident in his stride going back up, despite getting his nose severely damaged earlier today.<br />
Nate however was noticeably slower, still dealing with the inner ear imbalance after being attacked Labor Day.<br />
<i>At least he seems more steady and surer of himself on his feet now,</i> Martha thought positively.<br />
<br />
Yet her silence and continued staring at her sons were not lost on her husband.<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; asked William.<br />
&quot;Considering both my sons were attacked by madmen? I may have only been a werevixen since we moved to Moon Lake, but every maternal instinct I have is wanting me to find the bastards who hurt the boys and—&quot;<br />
&quot;I know dear,&quot; said William, taking her hand in his, since everyone had dinner in their human forms because the boys were under strict doctor&#39;s orders not to transform yet. Eric could start resuming his werepanther fursona in the morning after a good night&#39;s rest and his natural healing abilities as a were finished taking care of things, but Nate had to wait until his follow up appointment Friday before finding out when he could release his inner werewolf again.<br />
&quot;You look tired,&quot; observed William.<br />
&quot;I was going to say the same thing about you,&quot; commented Martha, the life/soulmate bond the two of them shared as members of the Skulk very strong and sensitive.<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you go upstairs and take a long hot shower?&quot; suggested her husband. &quot;I&#39;ll be up as soon as I&#39;ve cleaned up down here for the night.&quot;<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; asked Martha, to which William just nodded his head affirmatively.<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; said Martha, before giving him an intimate kiss.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; he said with a smile, before shooing her upstairs.<br />
<br />
Alone in the master bedroom they shared, Martha stripped in front of the full length mirror.<br />
She turned this way and that, admiring her luscious curves and bountiful bosom.<br />
<i>I&#39;d be far worse off if I was still human and pushing 40,</i> she thought, admiring herself in the mirror. <i>Even my pussy is more furry since I became a werevixen,</i> she noticed, lightly running her fingers through the hair above the hood hiding her clitoris. <i>I probably should trim it, but none of my lovers have ever complained...</i> recalling all the men and women whose sexual favors she has enjoyed and returned, let alone what fun lied in the future.<br />
<i>But I meant what I told William downstairs,</i> as Martha quickly assumed her fursona. <i>If I ever get my paws on that Jack Crawford or &quot;Piggy&quot; Wilson...</i> as she slashed at the air.<br />
<i>I may be a loving wife and mother, yet I do make one sexy werevixen too,</i> she realized with a smile, turning this way and that to admire her furry body. Her sensitive vulpine hearing could not only make out Nate and Eric in their respective bedrooms, but William downstairs cleaning up.<br />
Thoughts of her husband made Martha&#39;s bushy tail twitch.<br />
<i>We may be swingers, but even before acquiring the life/soul mate bond all foxes share between their mates, I&#39;ve always known William was my one true love. No matter how many men or women I have sex with, HE&#39;S still the one who I will share the rest of my life with.</i><br />
<br />
Turning to enter the master bathroom, Martha realized that it would take forever to wash if she stayed in her fursona, so reluctantly parted company with the vixen (for now), and stepped into shower.<br />
She was lost in the moment. Enjoying the hot water from the shower head hitting her body, easing the tension the day had built up within it.<br />
Martha reached behind her for her shampoo, only to discover the bottle was being held by someone else.<br />
&quot;Allow me, my dear,&quot; said William, as he started lathering up her hair.<br />
&quot;Oooooohhhhh....&quot; replied Martha, as she leaned back against his hairy chest to enjoy the moment.<br />
When exactly he made it back upstairs, let alone stripped and entered the shower she was uncertain of, for Martha had lost all track of time and everything else once she turned on the hot water. But there was no way she would say no to this, feeling her husband&#39;s fingers gently running through her hair and massaging her scalp.<br />
&quot;Williammmmmmmm....&quot; she moaned.<br />
&quot;Relax my love. I&#39;m here now,&quot; he said, as his slick hands left his wife&#39;s hair to start massaging Martha&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Between being a werefox and the life/soulmate bond between them, William Anderson knew exactly what his wife needed to relax, and was going to do his best to make sure Martha received such attention.<br />
His hard cock was firmly between her legs, but not penetrating either hole. It just slowly rocked back and forth teasingly as his hands drifted forward to cup her breasts from behind, the thumb and forefinger of each massaging the nipples.<br />
&quot;Yesssss....&quot; hissed Martha, even as she felt her body shudder in pleasure.<br />
William took a step forward, guiding Martha closer to the shower head until its spray started washing the shampoo out of her hair.<br />
When he knew it was all gone, William took a step back, bringing Martha with him thanks to the position of his cock and hands.<br />
Then he spun her around for a sweet kiss.<br />
&quot;What say we get out of this shower and take things to a more appropriate setting?&quot; William whispered in her ear after their lips parted.<br />
&quot;After I make sure you&#39;re clean,&quot; Martha said with a smile, before kissing her way down his chest.<br />
William soon knew what she meant as he felt Martha&#39;s tongue start to lick and tease around the tip of his penis.<br />
In an attempt to hopefully prolong the inevitable, William went ahead and washed his own hair as Martha stayed on her knees between his legs, giving him a lot of oral attention.<br />
It wasn&#39;t until after he felt Martha swallow what he expelled during his orgasm that he took her hand and raised his wife back to her feet.<br />
&quot;Now can we go to bed?&quot; he asked her.<br />
&quot;After we dry off,&quot; she replied with a mischievous smile on her face.<br />
<br />
The used towels laid on the bathroom floor between Martha and the linoleum as she placed herself on her hands and knees, wiggling her ass at him.<br />
William got into position and slowly entered her, his cock slipping into the wet folds of her vagina from behind.<br />
Although the physical union started as a man making love to his woman, it soon became a werefox enjoying the love of his vixen as each assumed their fursonas.<br />
A smile crossed William&#39;s muzzle as Martha turned to wink at him. His paws held her furry waist as the tip of her vulpine tail teased his muzzle.<br />
Her mate&#39;s response was to playfully nip at the tip of her tail while continuing the slow in and out dance of natural, physical love.<br />
It was only in the last few seconds before reaching mutual climax that William thrust into Martha the hardest, so each could experience the building intensity of orgasm to its fullest.<br />
Spent and satisfied for the moment, Martha managed to reposition herself so that her back was now against the towels so they could look at each other, because they would not be able to physically separate until his foxhood softened and its top knot slipped out of her.<br />
The two laid within each other&#39;s furry arms and kissed.<br />
Then William said, &quot;You know. I did plan to finish what I started in the shower and give you a nice long massage when we got in bed.&quot;<br />
&quot;You can still do that. Later,&quot; she replied, kissing him again before running her paws across his furry chest. &quot;Right now, I just want my mate to hold and love me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; said William, before spinning them around until it was his back against the floor and Martha was on top.<br />
&quot;I love you so much,&quot; declared Martha, as she ran her paws through his hair and teased William&#39;s pointed, furry ears.<br />
&quot;And I you,&quot; he said, pulling her closer until Martha&#39;s full weight was against him.<br />
&quot;Just hold me close dear heart,&quot; said Martha, nuzzling her head on his shoulder. &quot;Just love me and hopefully tomorrow will be far better than today was. With nobody wanting to harm our children, us, or anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although neither of them planned to, William and Martha Anderson fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms on the bathroom floor. Physically spent and emotionally exhausted.<br />
It would be a few hours before either of them woke up and finally got their mate to bed.<br />
There, William would finally finish giving Martha the gentle massage he wanted to, before the werefox and his mated vixen fell asleep once more in each other&#39;s furry arms.<br />
