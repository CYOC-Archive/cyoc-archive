<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff was ushered into a car, she found that the seats for it in this world weren&#39;t the same as her old one. It Was more like a motorcycle seat, but with a harness similar to an overly complicated seat belt that strapped her chest tight against it, making her breasts and vagina press into it, the rumble of the engine start-up letting a soft pleasure flow through her.<br />
<br />
As Jeff looked at her mother turned father, she couldn&#39;t help but think about how bad things almost went because of what she did to her... How intertwined their fates were now.<br />
<br />
Jeff made a little whine as she tried to voice how she felt. &quot;... How do you think they&#39;ll turn out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a lot of ways they could turn out,&quot; Jeff&#39;s &#39;father&#39; said, &quot;why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its just... I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about... How much I take after you two... And... I&#39;m just kind of worried, between them and me,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s father sighed. &quot;That&#39;s a lot to worry about. So I don&#39;t really know where to start,&quot; she said, &quot;You worried they&#39;d be inbred or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you put it like that...&quot; Jeff trailed off.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s father laughed. &quot;I asked the doctors about it while your mother was still pregnant with you and your sisters. Turns out it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eye widened, she had sisters now? From the same litter? She supposed that made sense, her now mother was a fox of sorts... But if so then why didn&#39;t the chonivac notice them? They should have been the same age as her, and still be living with them if that was the case.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure we talk about my sisters enough now that you mention it,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Her father sighed. &quot;Pretty hard to keep track of them all... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever explained this, but its not exactly normal nowadays to raise children yourself... Most of them get sent to boarding school as soon as they&#39;re weaned, where they&#39;re paired up with a couple of others to mate with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple of others?&quot; Jeff asked, &quot;you mean like... Male, Female, and hermaphrodite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically,&quot; her dad said, &quot;you probably never noticed that I&#39;ve got a boy partner along with your mom... Given that he&#39;s usually working abroad. You probably thought he was just a normal uncle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I guess I stayed with you because I don&#39;t really need a mate,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;that said... It sounds like I&#39;ve got a few half brothers and sisters you&#39;re the mother of then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can call a laying a clutch after every Christmas or two &#39;a few&#39;... But that&#39;s normal even for live births, given nobody actually makes birth control anymore, and abortions have become so pointless that nobody does them,&quot; her father groaned, &quot;but yeah... Two half brothers, and the rest of your dozens of half sisters turned out like me... Sometimes I think they keep the radiator in my eggs&#39; incubation chamber broken just so they get more of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a low thinking hum. &quot;... I wonder what sex my children would have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All girls to varying degrees,&quot; her dad said, &quot;statistically about half would be normal females like your mother, while the rest should be split between... Well... Being like you or me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sort of nodded, vocalizing it a bit so her dad would notice without having to take the eyes off the road.<br />
<br />
… Her mind began to wonder a bit, watching some of the people walking by... Almost all of them were a bit like her, various quadrupedal animals with just a hint of human. Not all of them were even fully clothed, she saw a group of naked huskies running by with their pointed dicks fully extended from their sheathes. Before she even realized she was staring, she felt her stomach growl and realized she was drooling.<br />
<br />
Her dad giggled and ruffled her hair. &quot;That&#39;s one trait your mother gave you to answer your earlier question,&quot; she said, &quot;its kind of ironic, you don&#39;t need to mate with a guy, and you&#39;re not even aroused by them, but you still need to suck them off every now and then just to feed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff pouted. &quot;Gees, you make me sound like some kind of succubus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not when you still need to eat other things,&quot; her dad said, &quot;after the doctors, I should probably take you to this one café though, you&#39;ve got a bunch of disembodied penises on life support... You always look so embarrassed with yourself when you have to turn to me for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff groaned. &quot;That&#39;s something I didn&#39;t want to think about today... How many times I&#39;ve had to suck my own father&#39;s cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her dad laughed. &quot;Its not that different from breast feeding,&quot; she said, &quot;you should know, given how often you forget to put anything on you go out, only for some passing kits to start nursing from you... Then again you always look embarrassed when that happens too, not that you ever stop them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes suddenly bulges as she looks down and see that she&#39;s sitting naked in the car seat; all four rows of her breasts on full display, and with not even panties separating her vulva from the seat, leaving a little bit of moisture on the seat pressed between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god I&#39;m naked now,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;who drags their daughter out of their room before they&#39;re even dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her father laughed again. &quot;Took you long enough to notice,&quot; she said, &quot;but I figured you&#39;d forget to put something on, so there&#39;s some panties and a tee-shirt inside the glove box... Sorry that its not boyshorts, but the store didn&#39;t stock them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff opened the glovebox, and sure enough there was a plain black tee-shirt and a dark blue pair of plain panties with a hole for her tail. Noticing a name tag on the panties, it appeared her name in this world was &#39;Jessica&#39;, probably &#39;Jess&#39; for short.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Not even pants?&quot; Jess said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Full pants won&#39;t be in stock till almost winter,&quot; her dad said, &quot;also over-shorts are getting a bit expensive since they&#39;re a luxury item now; so most just put up with showing off their underwear.&quot; Her dad paused. &quot;... Unless they&#39;re exhibitionists I guess... There isn&#39;t exactly a law discouraging anyone from going naked... Or public sex for that matter. Not that people won&#39;t yell at them for doing so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess sighed. &quot;I guess this will do then, thanks dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her dad just shrugged. &quot;Anyways... We&#39;re almost at the doctors... Hopefully this won&#39;t take long, and we can get your cum craving sorted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess squirmed nervously, not sure what exactly she was going to go through.</p>
