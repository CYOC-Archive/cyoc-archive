<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hate to be misleading, but the Adult Content option checked was the most accurate for this episode.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unable to resist, Peter Talbot leaned forward and gave his fiance Karen Yuletide a VERY passionate kiss.<br />
Karen actually felt herself issuing an attempt at purring in contentment as she returned the gesture.<br />
Soon the engaged couple were tightly embracing one another as their tongues took turns dancing in each other&#39;s mouth.<br />
But, as Karen started running her hands across Peter&#39;s body and moved to start undressing him, the werelion Prince of Moon Lake came back to reality.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said, reluctantly pulling away from her.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; replied Karen, while leaning her head against him. &quot;This has been building between us for a long time now. You know how much I love you and vice versa. It will just make Friday night and our first weekend together truly special,&quot; she added, looking at him affectionately.<br />
&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve been told that a were female&#39;s birth control pills take an hour to become fully effective for beginners,&quot; explained Peter. &quot;So we&#39;ll toast your first during dinner Friday night before going on to my family&#39;s cabin for the rest of our time together and your induction into were society.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can hardly wait,&quot; said Karen, before kissing Peter again. &quot;Any chance we can get an early start?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... my last class on Friday ends at 3. Barring anything unforeseen, we could be having dinner by 4, if you don&#39;t mind eating early.&quot;<br />
&quot;Depends upon what&#39;s on the menu,&quot; answered Karen with a sly smile.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been talking for quite a while and it&#39;s getting late,&quot; realized Peter, looking at Karen&#39;s dorm room clock that said it was now after 11. &quot;Until tomorrow, my love,&quot; before giving her an affectionate kiss on the cheek.<br />
&quot;May I walk you to the door sir?&quot; jokingly asked Karen, rising up.<br />
&quot;You may,&quot; replied Peter, standing up and briefly bowing before her.<br />
The couple held hands and in just a couple of steps, reached their destination.<br />
&quot;Well, here we are. Considering the time, I&#39;m not sure I can go any further without getting into trouble with the RA*,&quot; said Karen.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make sure not to be caught on my way out, and to deny your involvement if I am. To the future, my forthcoming Mrs. Talbot,&quot; said Peter, holding Karen close.<br />
&quot;To Friday night, my lion,&quot; replied Karen with a growl before kissing him.<br />
If Peter Talbot could smell the arousal leaking from between his fiance&#39;s legs, he didn&#39;t comment on it as he smiled. It was a situation Karen planned to address as soon as he was gone.<br />
With one last kiss, they parted company for the night.<br />
Karen watched, dreamily, as Peter walked stealthily down the hall and then started descending the stairs so silently, it was as if he didn&#39;t exist.<br />
But his fiance knew otherwise, and she couldn&#39;t wait for Friday night and all the nights beyond as Karen closed her dorm room door and hastily started undressing...<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Ginger O&#39;Toole asked John Harper.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, a little nervously.<br />
The two of them were standing together in the woods. Ginger was in all her furry weretigress glory. John was as naked as the day he was born.<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s do this,&quot; said Ginger confidently, giving John&#39;s human lips one final kiss.<br />
Soon John felt his hands affectionately gripping furry hips as his cock sank deeply into its target.<br />
John Harper smiled at the loss of his virginity. Something his father preached as sex before marriage being a sin.<br />
He moved his hips back and forth, feeling his hard manhood plunge even further inside as both parties moaned in passion.<br />
They both knew the inevitable would happen quickly on his first time, and John didn&#39;t disappoint as he experienced his first sexual orgasm with a partner.<br />
But the best was yet to come.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s starting,&quot; announced Ginger, noticing the orange fur beginning to emerge on John&#39;s body.<br />
Soon John relished the experience of his first transformation as he joined were society.<br />
His arms and legs grew longer and more muscular as they became covered with orange and black fur in a classic tiger pattern.<br />
He could fell his feet and hands changing into their respective paws, and watched the claws actually emerge from his fingertips.<br />
John felt his butt ache slightly as his new tail began to spring forth. It grew in length with the fur covering following close behind.<br />
His shoulders, neck, and head began to alter.<br />
John felt his ears begin to shift position even as his mouth expanded into a muzzle and new, sharper teeth appeared within it.<br />
But the best part was fast approaching.<br />
Even with his now barbed and much longer penis still buried in his partner, John felt another orgasm about to occur.<br />
He roared in pure joy at both it and becoming the newest weretiger of Moon Lake.<br />
John Harper felt content to just lay in the grass with his partner, enjoying the sensations of his new life and form.<br />
Then, reluctantly, his penis slipped out. Spent, for now.<br />
&quot;Well, how do you feel?&quot; his partner asked, before the weretiger that John had been with kissed him.<br />
Before John could answer, Ginger wrapped her furry arms around his new furry waist and asked, &quot;Ready for me, my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, John Harper awoke from his dream in a start.<br />
He was within his bed within the guest room of the Jenkins house, still human, but with a telltale wetness within his borrowed pajama bottoms.<br />
<i>What is wrong with me?</i> John asked himself yet again, while getting up to go to the bathroom and clean up the best he could.<br />
He had spent the evening on the computer in Henry Jenkins, Senior&#39;s den, trying to research his &quot;condition&quot;.<br />
To say that his parents, especially his father, were strict was a serious understatement.<br />
His father was not only a firm believer in &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot;, but backed that up with tough religious conviction too.<br />
His mother wasn&#39;t much better, always bending to whatever dad believed, but John knew his troubles would be just beginning if they discovered that the only person his own age who ever expressed any true interest in their son was another guy.<br />
It&#39;s not that John Harper hated women.<br />
Just that, considering his background, his dealings with them in social situations were greatly limited.<br />
Here in Moon Lake however, John had a taste of freedom that he had never known before, now that he and the rest of his siblings were free of his father&#39;s yoke.<br />
That had led to only more questions and confusion.<br />
Yet surprisingly, the fact that were creatures not only existed, but that Moon Lake was highly populated with them, wasn&#39;t a problem.<br />
John stared at himself in the bathroom mirror, and once more asked himself the one question that he dearly wished he had an answer for more than any other.<br />
<i>Am I gay, straight, or bi?</i><br />
Gay would mean that he had no interest in women whatsoever. But where would that leave Ginger O&#39;Toole?<br />
She was the first girl, let alone the first person in Moon Lake, who had ever expressed any true interest in him personally.<br />
<i>I like her. She&#39;s my friend, and it doesn&#39;t matter if she&#39;s a weretigress. My sister Jenny and her new husband are both werefoxes. So if someday, Ginger and I reach that point in our lives...</i><br />
Straight would mean he was only interested in females. Yet, besides wondering how things would have turned out with his friend back in Alabama if circumstances there were different, John still wondered about the possibility of being with a guy in general.<br />
<i>So does that mean I&#39;m bi?</i> he asked himself. <i>But would Ginger still like me if I wanted to be with a male? If I love her, shouldn&#39;t she be the one I give my virginity to, let alone make me a weretiger?</i><br />
His reflection in the mirror had no response.<br />
<i>In The Bible, it&#39;s Adam and Eve. NOT Adam and Steve!</i> he could hear his father yelling at two guys who were hugging each other on a park bench when his family walked past on the way to a church picnic once.<br />
<i>Now that it&#39;s safe for me to finally ask the questions, I have absolutely no idea how to properly discover the answers!</i><br />
Frustrated, John Harper finished cleaning up his mess the best he could, then tried to go back to sleep.<br />
<br />
