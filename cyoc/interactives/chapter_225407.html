<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was strange for Nancy to see Charlotte like this. Sure, she has seen her friend transform and expand in many ways over the week. But this takes the cake for her on the oddness of her miraculous nanomachines.<br />
The two ladies were busy shopping at the mall, with Charlotte taking the lead with Nancy following up and carrying multiple bags of clothes and accessories. “Listen, I know that you had to get a new wardrobe since you kept your figure from yesterday. But why does everything have to be in dark colors and have a gothic theme to it?”<br />
<br />
The once positive Charlotte, now a shadow of her former self, turned around and said, “Because there is beauty in darkness. That and black go with everything.” She crossed her pale arms under her still swollen bust, dressed not in her usual style of outfits that she liked to wear. Her times as a succubus from yesterday may have ended, with her losing her devilish features, apparently the nanomachines have decided to leave in her current sizes for her asset. In return, those bots had drained the pigment in her skin and dyed her hair raven-black.<br />
The few clothes that Charlotte walked out of that she is currently wearing is a halter top along with a pleated skirt, all black with the only other color being the gray lines in her skirt. She also bought some fishnet stockings and gloves to go alongside the rest of her outfit, with some heavy black boots that add some extra inches to her height.<br />
<br />
“How about we have some lunch at the food court, Charlotte? I’m sure that you are starving from all this walking and shopping,” pleaded Nancy. Charlotte angrily turned around, not caring that her breasts were jiggling inside her tight top and nearly throwing her off balance. “How many times do I have to tell you, don’t call me Charlotte! It’s Cordelia now.” <br />
<br />
Unlike the other transformation, where there are little to no changes to Charlotte’s personality, this time around she has become a full-on goth girl. Even when she was getting ready for the day, she spent a good amount of time on her makeup to perfect her new darker image. But since Charlotte is that much into makeup, Cordelia has to use a not-so-dark red lipstick and what little is left of her eyeshadow that she has.<br />
<br />
Still unused to her new identity, Nancy asked the question again, “Okay, Char- I mean, Cordelia, do you want some lunch?” Her friend-turned-stranger thought for a moment before agreeing to have a meal. “Okay, Nancy let’s go have something to eat,” and Cordelia started to make her way not to the food court but toward a sit-down restaurant next to it. <br />
“Cordelia, why are you going to the restaurant? I thought we agreed to the food court.” The gothic girl just kept on walking, either not hearing her friend’s question or refusing to answer is anyone guess. Knowing that it was hopeless to dine separately, Nancy followed right behind Cordelia into the restaurant.<br />
<br />
Once the two ladies were seated at an empty booth and ordered something to eat, Nancy began to ask some questions that were on her mind all morning. “Okay, Char-” “Cordelia.” “Cordelia, sorry. This is a little hard for me to understand. Like, are you still my friend?” Cordelia looked away for a moment, thinking how to answer that question.<br />
“It’s like I’m still myself, but now there is this darker version of myself too, if that makes sense. Like how I love to watch the sunset, but now I also appreciate the night sky and the stars that come after it too.” Nancy whispered to herself, “So Charlotte is still there, just buried under the coding of being a goth girl,” then back at her friend, “So the persona of Cordelia is what exactly? Parts of you, and parts of the programming?”<br />
<br />
After another deep thought that lasted longer than the first time, Cordelia just shrugged her shoulder. “50/50 between me and your machines. Maybe 60/40 since I am secretly enjoying it. I mean, I have a new name and a killer look to go with it.” Cordelia said this while squeezing her breasts in her tight top. Nancy looked away with her hands covering her face in shame, with a little bit of blush peeking out behind her hands.<br />
“Cordelia, you are going to get in trouble. Stop playing around.” Her friend did stop playing herself but not before saying something to Nancy. “Okay, Nancy. But there were some cute guys across the way that were looking at us.” Curious about what she meant, Nancy peeked a little between her fingers and saw some guys by the bar. While not as drunk as that one guy was a couple of nights ago, the men at the bar did have a couple of glasses in front of them. And they were all watching Cordelia showing off her goods.<br />
<br />
“What is our luck and getting drunk guys,” Nancy mumbled through her hand. “I don’t know, but I know how to get rid of them.” Nancy glared at her “friend” while still buried in her hand, and mumbled, “How?” Cordelia just smiled darkly and said, “Well, it can only work if you take your hands off your face. Trust me” Nancy slowly took her hands off her face. “Okay, Cordelia. What is this pla-” was all Nancy could say before her friend went up to her face and kissed her on the lips, full-on French too on Cordelia’s end.<br />
<br />
After what felt like forever but was a little over a minute, Cordelia broke off the kiss and faced the now awkward group of men. “Yeah, I’m a big tiddy goth girlfriend. And no, I am not bi. She is my girlfriend and you can’t have her.” The boys started to look away from the girls, either staring at the bottom of their glasses or tapping at their phones. “Well, that took care of that. They won’t be bothering us again. Hey, are you okay over there Nancy?” <br />
The girl who was called Nancy was still stunned at what just happens. Even when their food came out, Nancy still sat there with a spaced-out look to her. “Do you want me to pack up your food, Nancy?” The only words that Nancy spoke after her first gay kiss were, “You are not Charlotte.” The big tiddy goth girlfriend just smiled and said, “How many times do I have to tell you, my name is Cordelia.”</p>
