<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before getting started, Gloria decided to unpack her clothes and toiletries. She&#39;d brought a variety of clothing for virtually any occasion she might find herself in, from formal to super-casual. She&#39;d also bought several cheap outfits that could be ruined without a second thought. Part of what thrilled her most about the thought of changing was the idea of possibly ripping her clothing, just like out of a horror movie.<br />
<br />
Even if the change didn&#39;t happen like that, she wanted to be able to change and perhaps not worry about what happened to her clothing, if, for example, she was at one of the common areas of the resort. The dresser and closet were spacious-remarkably so, in fact. She had more than enough room to store her clothing and probably another two suitcases at least!<br />
<br />
The bathroom was remarkably appointed as well- a marble counter framed the sink, and the bathtub itself was shining porcelain with a vintage-looking shower head as well. The only way she could tell that it wasn&#39;t legitimately an antique, or even old was how shiny the metal was, and that it had a more modern, flexible hose attached to it. But the real jewel of the bathroom was the compact but deep hot tub, and Gloria shivered slightly as rather naughty thoughts entered her mind unbidden.<br />
<br />
Once she&#39;d made peace with her genuine sexual kink of transformation, Gloria had found that her sex drive had kicked up to much higher levels just as a general rule. Once she&#39;d ceased to deny herself the indulgence of her darker/kinkier/wilder fantasies, she&#39;d found herself hitting a harder orgasm far more easily and far more frequently. One of her favorite things to do when she was feeling “naughty” was to go to her local spa and take advantage of their pool and hot tub, and when she was granted enough solitude, to let the water jets massage her to a climax. The opportunity didn&#39;t happen often, but when it did, she&#39;d close her eyes and fantasize about both the women and the men she fancied transforming along with her. She licked her lips as she stared at the hot tub-for once, there&#39;d be no worries about being interrupted if she decided to indulge the urge to let the water massage her. She wouldn&#39;t even have to wear a stitch of clothing! <br />
<br />
She quickly offloaded her makeup, perfume, and toiletries into the medicine cabinet and the storage drawers of the pedestal below the sink. She almost panicked when she couldn&#39;t find her birth control-no need to have an extra souvenir from her trip- but she found the small container trapped under her hair dryer.<br />
<br />
Gloria wasn&#39;t ashamed to admit that the goal of the trip, in addition to being transformed, was to have a wild fling with at least one person, and preferably more. While she was far from a lonely woman at home, even casual flings for her were a bit empty. At the end of the encounter, no matter how hard she tried to focus on the fantasy that the man fucking her from behind was turning into a werewolf, he wasn&#39;t. No matter how hard she wished, her nails weren&#39;t turning into claws.  But here..perhaps they could be. She didn&#39;t exactly check the details on how transformations were achieved. She&#39;d seen the anthro wolves though, and they were precisely like the bipedal werewolves that she fantasized about. Even the thought of how close she was to being able to realize her fantasy got her wet, and Gloria again thought about getting herself off before exploring the resort, though she shrugged the thought off for now. Still, she didn&#39;t push the thought of fucking a werewolf out of her mind. She knew that the longer she let herself stew on it all and get aroused, the harder her climax would be, whether it was by herself, or with someone else, whether they were male or female.<br />
<br />
Gloria always thought of herself as mostly straight, but a bit curious. As she grew more comfortable with her own fantasies, she started noticing women a bit more, and that curiosity had grown, but had remained that, until two things had happened. First, she saw Trick R Treat, and watched undeniably gorgeous women transform into werewolves. While the skin-ripping aspect didn&#39;t necessarily fit her kink (it looked painful and a bit gory), she found herself getting hotter and wetter as she watched the early stages of their change, where their eyes were flashing and fangs were growing. That year, another friend of hers had gone to her Halloween party as Anna Paquin&#39;s character, complete with a dental appliance to make her teeth look sharper and contacts to make her eyes look wolfish. It had been a coincidence-her friend reviewd movies for a horror-themed blog, and she&#39;d been utterly unaware of Gloria&#39;s fetish. As the night wore on, Gloria found herself increasingly attracted to Dana, her recently single friend, and they&#39;d ended up in bed together. While initially it had been a one-night stand (with a small bit of awkwardness in the morning) they&#39;d found each other in intimate situations on more than a handful of occasions if Dana said or did something that made Gloria think of werewolves. Almost instantly, her mind would start thinking of Dana transforming, and she&#39;d find her irresistible. Even after Dana had gotten a boyfriend, Gloria had found herself in a three-way with Dana and her boyfriend Earl, due to an invitation to come watch Wolf Cop. (A lower budget werewolf movie. She wasn&#39;t a fan of the look of the werewolf specifically, but it was still enough to drive her wild at her core.)<br />
<br />
It was after that when Gloria realized that while she might be mostly straight, all bets were off when transformation was on her mind. And truthfully, she DID enjoy her experiences with Dana. For Gloria, it was less about male or female- she was attracted to werewolves. She also had begun getting rather attracted to werecats, and practically any predatory mammal.<br />
<br />
As she ran excitedly and leapt on the pillowy king-sized bed, she realized it was even more than that..simply any transformation at all would be enough to make her attracted to practically any person. Even reptilian (ooh, those tongues!) or avian (the mere thought of the stroke of feathers along her skin gave her goosebumps)..or canine (she&#39;d had fantasies about being fucked from behind by a dog after seeing a man who bore a strong resemblance to his Great Dane once). And now, the possibilities were all at her fingertips! The ability to change and see others change was her greatest fantasy, and it was on the verge of being realized.<br />
<br />
Still, she wondered, how did they do it? She&#39;d done her research-as best she could tell, the resort was legitimate in its claims. She&#39;d been on every tf-related forum and message board, and everyone there was singing the praises of it..well, at least those who claimed to have gone. Many of them were relating what they&#39;d been told, or what they heard from second or third-hand sources. (Sometimes even more, bordering on urban legend type veracity.) She&#39;d seen the people..the ANIMAL people when she&#39;d arrived at the wing. It couldn&#39;t be a scam, or if it was, it was a high budget one. Perhaps it was just fantasy? Gloria frowned at the thought, though cheered herself up by realizing the freedom of having a week to be literally herself, open to sex and sexuality, unhindered by having to hide any aspect of her fetish from other resort visitors. Even if it wasn&#39;t real, it could be the most liberating experience of her life.<br />
<br />
Wanting to get to the bottom of it, she dialed the front desk. <br />
<br />
“This is Amy, what can I do for you.....” there was a pause as Gloria heard the sounds of keys being punched quickly on a computer, “Gloria? Is everything alright with your room?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” Gloria replied. “It&#39;s fabulous. But I&#39;m a little confused. How does the transformation work?”<br />
<br />
Amy laughed softly, “I&#39;m soo sorry. I forgot to tell you that if you turn to channel three on your in-room television, it will walk you through it. It&#39;s one of those things that plays on a loop. It starts every five minutes.”<br />
<br />
“Wonderful,” Gloria said, hunting for her remote.<br />
<br />
“Again, I&#39;m REALLY sorry,” Amy told her. “If there&#39;s anything else I can do for you, don&#39;t hesitate to ask.”<br />
<br />
Gloria thanked her and turned on the television just in time to see the screen fade to black for a moment, only to light back up almost immediately with a panoramic-type shot of the resort. It was an aerial shot, and she couldn&#39;t help but marvel at just how large the property was. The hotel itself was 20 stories, with each of the three wings extending out and upward just as high. There were a variety of buildings behind the hotel, with neon signs visible (but unlit, because it was during the day), along with a large forest or jungle (she couldn&#39;t tell) and massive pools. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to the Transformation Resort-A one of a kind destination where all of your fantasies can come true!” said an enthusiastic voice. <br />
<br />
“Since you&#39;ve obviously found your room, we know that your first question is about how you might transform!” The shot changed to a variety of men and women (all adult) nodding enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
“Well, okay, we&#39;ll get right to it!” The voice said with a laugh. “If you go to your refrigerator, you&#39;ll find a bottle of a clear liquid marked &#39;base enzyme&#39; – this is what makes it possible for your transformation to happen! Just add four drops to a glass of water, and wait just five minutes, and you&#39;re well on your way to changing!” The voice was perpetually enthusiastic, almost to a point of mockery. Gloria couldn&#39;t tell if it was meant to be a self-parody of many resorts&#39; introductory guest videos, or if it was unintentional.<br />
<br />
The shot changed to a picture of the bottle, and Gloria hopped up and found it. It was a fairly small and nondescript bottle, but one with a dropper in the top. She got a glass of water and added the enzyme to her glass with shaky hands, then gulped it down. She felt a wave of heat pass through her body, just a tingling warmth. She wasn&#39;t sure if she&#39;d imagined it or not.<br />
<br />
“Feel that warmth? That means it&#39;s working!” The television helpfully informed her. Well, that answered THAT question. The shot changed to a confused looking blonde woman. “So how do I make sure I change into WHAT I want to be?”<br />
<br />
“Well, that&#39;s the beauty of it!” said that omnipresent narrator&#39;s voice. “It&#39;s all up to you! I&#39;m going to tell you a secret-that base enzyme you drank is made up of tiny nanites!”<br />
<br />
“Nanites?” the confused woman asked.<br />
<br />
“Nanites are tiny machines that can do AMAZING things-things you wouldn&#39;t think possible in the so-called &#39;real world&#39;! Now, what you need to do is to download the TF Resort App to your smartphone, or if you don&#39;t have a smartphone, contact the desk, and they can set you up at a kiosk.”<br />
<br />
“What can those tiny machines ACTUALLY do?” a skeptical looking man asked as the shot changed. His arms were crossed, and his posture and expression were exaggerated like someone on an infomercial.<br />
<br />
“Well, friend,” said the narrator with a mildly sarcastic tone, “The bots are connected to our main computer server, and the app lets you tell them what to do. They come preloaded with a variety of common metabolites-chemicals that cause the physical changes- and with the app, you can control every aspect of your change!” A softer voice added “Some exotic options may require additional ingestion of enzymes. A front desk clerk will be happy to assist you.”<br />
<br />
The next few shots quickly shot between various people.<br />
<br />
“Pleasurable?” asked a woman in a clingy dress who smirked at the camera and had a sultry tone.<br />
<br />
“YES!” Boomed the voice. “The nanites can ensure maximum dopamine production, along with stimulation of intimate nerve endings to guarantee that your change is the best thing you&#39;ve ever felt!”<br />
<br />
“Painful?” asked a man with a dark edge to his voice and who glared at the camera.<br />
<br />
“YES!” Boomed the voice. “Our nanites can equally repel dopamine production and heighten your nerve sensitivity to ensure you feel ever second of the change!<br />
<br />
“Involuntary?” asked a woman dressed very professionally, who seemed rather smug.<br />
<br />
“YES!” the voice said, getting an overly theatrical jaw-drop from her. “You can set your transformation duration, reversion, and onset to random in the options!”<br />
<br />
“Triggered?” asked a couple together, glancing at each other suggestively. <br />
<br />
“YES!” The voice said, causing the girl to giggle and bury her face in his chest. “You can link control of YOUR nanites to someone else&#39;s app and give them all the control, or you can set the precise trigger in the options! Anything, from external stimulation..” the voice got slightly suggestive in its tone and the couple began to rub each other a bit.<br />
<br />
“To a beverage..” the same couple was practically leering at each other as they toasted with wine glasses.<br />
<br />
“To food..” the first woman from the infomercial in her clingy dress took a bite from what looked like a cat-shaped cookie<br />
<br />
“To light..” the voice said, and a shot of the man staring out a window as moonlight streamed in was shown before the screen faded away. Gloria was immensely wet right from seeing that whole segment, and she quickly picked up her phone to search for the app, only to find that it had apparently auto-downloaded. It was increasingly difficult for her to keep her hands off of herself.<br />
<br />
The voice resumed as the screen showed several shots of people dining and dancing. “In addition to the standard night life you might expect, we have a variety of clubs designed to cater to people of specific tastes, as well as restaurants that indulge the more..predatory..aspects some of our clientele enjoys.”A shot of a werewolf and a weretigress dining on rabbits, still quite uncooked and unskinned, filled the screen.<br />
<br />
“Yes, whether it&#39;s nature,” the screen panned through some of the forest, “socialization,” the screen changed to show a group of laughing people who smiled as they turned to the camera with distinctly inhuman eyes, “or something more...intimate..” the giggling couple reappeared, and as the man helped her remove her shirt, a line of fur could be seen sprouting along her spine as she grinned coyly over her shoulder at the camera, “The Transformation Resort: Where your WILDEST dreams come true!”<br />
<br />
With her hands shaking, Gloria double-tapped the app icon on her phone.</p>
