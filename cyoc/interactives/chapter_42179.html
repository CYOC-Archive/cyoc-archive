<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We need to get people out of here&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get them to safety Shaela&quot; Marry said her voice strained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't portal all of them&quot; Shaela said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Portal all you can then come back for more&quot; Marry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may not have the energy&quot; Shaela said. &quot;I need to get you girls out of here before you get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the people out of here first&quot; Jen said. &quot;We'll hold the wolves off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Shaela said. &quot;I think this is a mistake though.&quot; She disappeared along with twelve people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give us room people!&quot; Allison shouted to make sure they heard her.<br />
<br />
They people moved back into the church toward the alter. A wolf lunged at one and cut him deeply. Blood ran down his leg and hit the church floor. Suddenly a voice boomed out &quot;Yes!&quot; This was quickly followed by the leader of the demonic wolves coming into the church. People panicked and ran around jostling everyone.<br />
<br />
Allison never saw the leader lunge at her from behind and sink his teeth into her left shoulder again. She let out a howl of pain and went to her knees. &quot;Not again&quot; she said through gritted teeth. She couldn't tell where the others were and she was afraid for them. She heard others scream in pain and the sounds of them transforming. She couldn't tell how many were becoming demonic wolves but the growls of the wolves were becoming more numerous.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Shaela said &quot;I'm sorry Allison but I can't portal you out of here. Right now your a danger to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison opened her eyes to see Shaela crying. &quot;I understand&quot; she said. &quot;Get the others out of here. They can't hold all the wolves off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaela nodded and disappeared. Around Allison the commotion was dieing down. She felt two hands grab hold of her and drag her up to the altar. There she saw Father Winston clutching his right shoulder. She guessed that he had been bit too.<br />
<br />
The leader came up to them and said &quot;It's no use fighting it. A demon was born when I bit you and is taking over your bodies now. Soon you will join be one of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will never be one of you&quot; Father Winston said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't either&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
The wolves laughed at this and the leader said &quot;You don't have a choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is always a choice&quot; Allison said. She put her good arm around Father Winston and said &quot;Hurricane Winds!&quot; Mighty winds swirled out from her blowing the wolves back. She flapped her wings and flew herself and Father Winston out of the church even though it hurt her shoulder to flap her wings.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Slifer was patching the girls up after their escape. Charlene, Andrew, George, Margaret, Josephine, and Lance were looking at their daughters with worried expressions. &quot;Sorry Mum&quot; Jen said. &quot;We tried not to get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Charlene said. &quot;You did the right thing by staying to hold the wolves back to give Shaela time to get people out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many got out?&quot; Harriette asked holding her arm. She had received a deep cut on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only got twenty-four others out&quot; Shaela said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The church holds eighty people&quot; Josephine said in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means that there are fifty-two new demonic wolves&quot; Slifer said finishing bandaging Marry and going to Harriette. &quot;This is most disturbing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;According to Shaela Allison and Father Winston were also bitten&quot; Lance said. &quot;That makes the number fifty-four doesn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison can fight the possession for a time&quot; Slifer said. &quot;How long she can I don't know. As for Father Winston I can only surmise that he can fight it too from what you've told me. He might even be able to beat it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Allison will become one?&quot; Charlene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eventually&quot; Slifer said.<br />
<br />
Charlene let out a little wail and nestled her head against Andrew's chest.<br />
<br />
Andrew wrapped his arms around his wife and asked &quot;Is there anything we can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The church is in the wolves' hands now&quot; Arcturo said. &quot;It would be suicide to go in there to rescue Allison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have to find a safe place&quot; Shaela said.<br />
<br />
&quot;True&quot; Slifer said. &quot;It could be that the wolves have enough numbers now that they can ignore the Homestead Laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe this&quot; Charlene said. &quot;I thought that I had left this behind when I was freed from Karther's control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone looked down and had tears in their eyes.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
The leader looked at his pack and smiled. He could now go into homes and drag people out to be converted. He couldn't convert them in their homes yet but he would be able to soon enough.<br />
<br />
Alex came up and asked &quot;What of the girl and priest mighty Zamdarr?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They will return to us soon enough&quot; Zamdarr said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But couldn't the angels find them and exorcise them?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a remote possibility&quot; Zamdarr said. &quot;Though they have to find them first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will the angels come here?&quot; a woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won't because we are so many now and they are spread out&quot; Zamdarr said. &quot;They would have to send eighty angels to deal with us now. They can't stop us now.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the wolves howled in what they perceived as victory.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Allison landed in an alley since the pain in her shoulder was becoming unbearable flying. She looked at Father Winston and said &quot;I'm sorry about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have nothing to be sorry for young lady&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;I don't think we know each other. I'm Father Winston.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Allison&quot; Allison said. &quot;You lost your church and you'll more than likely become one of those demonic wolves like I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was just a building&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;What makes a church are it's people. As long as there are people that believe in God and me I will never lose my church. As for becoming one of those damned things I'll fight it. I'll fight it with everything I have and so will you. I heard you say to that cat that you understood. You told her to get the others out. You and the others stayed to buy as much time as possible for the cat to get as many people out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The cat's name is Shaela&quot; Allison said. &quot;And I'm afraid that she didn't get many people out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did get some though&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;That's what's important. Now, can you walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so&quot; Allison said standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;We need to get someplace where we can get these wounds cleaned and bandaged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't go around people though&quot; Allison said. &quot;We may change and hurt them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won't hurt them too bad if we change&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;That big wolf seems to want to convert as many people as possible and the others followed that lead. I know of a place where we can get help and most of it is on Holy Ground. Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison decided to trust Father Winston and followed him.</p>
