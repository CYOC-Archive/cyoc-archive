<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam paled at her words.  Admittedly his lust almost got the better of him for a second, but, no!  It was just wrong.  She was a total stranger, for starters, and, hell, she was twice his age!<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I know, we can&#39;t.  There&#39;s that stupid law, and you&#39;re a minor.  It was just innocent teasing.&quot;  but she gave him a wink that seemed anything but innocent.  She noticed his distress at the wink.  &quot;Sorry!  It&#39;s hard to stop myself sometimes.  I promise I&#39;ll be a good girl from now on!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was skeptical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t just stand there.  Come along and let&#39;s get you signed in!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so he followed her into the facility, trying not to stare at her generous ass as she sashayed her way through the grounds ahead of him.   Soon he was registered and assigned a room.  31B, Phoenix building.  Orientation was in the main hall in 2 hours, but he had till then to do as he pleased.  He figured he&#39;d check out his room first, maybe try to rest and not think about things for a while.  He made some excuse and ditched Candi and headed for the Phoenix dorms.  <br />
<br />
The facility was actually quite nice.  He hoped the food would be good.  Then he opened the door to phoenix hall and his jaw almost fell from his face, because right in front of him stood Anna Hanson, the most beautiful girl from his school, and his crush.  She was looking about as miserable as he felt.  Then she noticed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam?&quot;  She asked.  It should have been a blissful moment, to learn that she even knew his name, but right now he just wanted to crawl into a hole.  He could hardly have a chance at becoming her boyfriend if he was going to be a girl in a week.  Then he noticed that her face was going as pale as his probably was.  Wait, if she was here, that meant...she was turning into a monster too? Oh no...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me.&quot;  He said, gathering his courage and stepping closer.  &quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;m happy to see you here.  You got it too?&quot;<br />
<br />
blushing she looked down at her feet and nodded.  He wanted to ask what she was turning into, but then she might ask the same thing of him, and he sure didn&#39;t want to tell her THAT.  But then he noticed something...she was emitting an energy like...like...like Candi!  It was subtle, weaker, but she had the same sex energy that made everything about Candi so irresistible.  God, if his crush was turning into a succubus, he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be able to resist her like he&#39;d resisted Candi, but maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so bad to turn into a monster if he&#39;d be the same kind of monster as her.  Maybe they&#39;d at least be friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you&#39;re a succubus?&quot;  He asked.<br />
<br />
But her shame looked all the deeper and she shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;huh?&quot;  Asked Sam.  &quot;Then what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Incubus.&quot;  She muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I know you&#39;re embarrassed, but I don&#39;t know what an incubus is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Male...a male succubus.&quot; she choked out the words with tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, Anna, I&#39;m so sorry.  If it makes you feel any better,  I&#39;m going through it too.  I&#39;m...I&#39;m turning into a succubus.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up now in shock.  He was afraid of how she&#39;d react, but only compassion for him filled her eyes.  Eventually, she managed to smile.  &quot;I guess that makes us kindred spirits, huh?  Well, maybe it&#39;ll be easier with a friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Figuring he had nothing to lose now, Sam went for broke.  &quot;I hope so, but to be honest I&#39;d hoped to be more than your friend.  I&#39;ve had a crush on you for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  she asked, and a little smile came to her face.  He nodded, and she spoke again.  &quot;So have you checked out your room yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
He replied with a negative, and she suggested she&#39;d go with him to check it out.  When they got inside his new room he had just enough time to notice that his roommate wasn&#39;t in and to hear the door shut before Anna had pushed him against the wall and locked her lips with his.  His brain exploded with the sensations, and he wondered if kissing your crush always felt this good or if it had something to do with their changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; she said.  &quot;I need this. I need to feel like a woman.  I need you to make a woman out of me.&quot;  Her hand slipped down to grab his bulge and began caressing the length of his growing erection through his pants. &quot;Let me make a man out of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, Anna.&quot;  He groaned. &quot;Gladly.&quot; He said with a growl, and began to kiss her back, taking the more aggressive role.  She happily submitted, a cute little whimper escaping her mouth at the sound of his growl, and then happily opening her mouth to accept his tongue inside.<br />
<br />
They made out for only a few moments before he picked her up and carried her to the bed.  He tore her clothes off, and went to work on his own.  She posed for him as sexily as she could as he stripped off his shirt.  &quot;Tell me I&#39;m beautiful.&quot;  She said.  As he managed to get his pants and underwear off his erection proudly bounced free, and too lust-driven to worry about his socks he crawled on top of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the most beautiful, sexiest girl in the whole wide world,&quot;  he said, and he meant it.<br />
<br />
She looked into his eyes with adoration then, and he knew she was his.  If only it could last...<br />
<br />
His member pressed against her entrance, and she cooed his name as she spread her legs for him.  At last, he began to push in, slowly, until he encountered resistance.  She was a virgin?  The thought filled him with even more desire.   He pressed forward, forcefully enough to penetrate but he hoped gentle enough to make it easy on her.   She cried out, perhaps a bit in pain but mostly in desire, and urged him on.  &quot;Yes, take me!&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t need to be told twice, pulling back and then thrusting in full force.  She cried out and he could tell she was in some pain but she might even be liking it...  At any rate, she only begged for me.  &quot;Come on Sam, fuck me!&quot;<br />
<br />
and so he did.  He pumped in and out, faster and faster, harder and harder until she was an incoherent moaning mess impaled upon his cock.  His climax was approaching, and he went at it even harder.  &quot;Anna, I&#39;m cumming!&quot;  He said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Give it all to me!&quot; she replied.  She didn&#39;t have to wait long.  He buried himself to the hilt as his cock jerked and spasmed and fired its seed deep into her womb.  She wrapped her legs around him, holding him inside, and came herself as she felt his cum release deep inside of her.</p>
