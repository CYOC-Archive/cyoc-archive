<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finn considered what he would type.<br />
<br />
First of all, Vance was a huge jackass that literally tried to steal his phone because he was playing with it in class. Who the fuck does that? He couldn’t even imagine doing something like that, it was super nosy and downright rude. So he wasn’t going to change him into an anthro horse, because Vance needed to be punished. Anthro jackass, then? Donkeys were hot.<br />
<br />
Hmm, and turning him literally into a jock might be fun, but wrong. Essentially murdering someone for being rude was kinda evil. Maybe the team mascot, perhaps? Definitely the center of attention. But also inanimate, so that would be unfair, right?<br />
<br />
He could see Vance getting fidgety and tightened his grip on his phone. Why the hell had he even told the guy about the Chronivac? He’d need to check the logs where it said Jeff had turned him into a pathetic bitch. Sure, he was a nerdy little gay fox, but that was no excuse. <br />
<br />
Fuck it, give him what he wanted, then.<br />
<br />
‘Vance is an anthro horse, champion running back for my college football team. Vance is a total stud, kind and charismatic, if a little full of himself, and can pull any guy he wants. Vance is incredibly talented and skilled at sports and loves showing off on the field and is the center of attention whenever he gets the football. Vance has no interest in the Chronivac, and is completely satisfied with his changes.’<br />
<br />
Finn heaved a sigh and hit enter.<br />
<br />
“Well, did you do it?” Vance asked eagerly, not noticing his spine popping as he grew taller, hair growing in a long, luxurious mane that he had to brush from his eyes. “Can I see?”<br />
<br />
“Sure.” Finn gave him a winning smile and handed over his phone. “Sorry, but I added something of a failsafe.”<br />
<br />
“Ooooh!” Vance take the phone with hands that were growing bigger, losing his pinky, while the nails thickened and darkened into hooflets. His large, pretty brown eyes widened and he snorted, nostrils flaring and staying flared as he read what Finn had wrote. “How’d you know I was gay?”<br />
<br />
“I guessed.” Finn shrugged, trying not to smirk. That was a just a little thing he’d added just for himself. He’d known nothing of the sort. “Anything you’d like me to change?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm…” Vance scratched his chest as chestnut-brown hide covered every inch of his body. The arm he was scratching with began to bulge with muscles, his shoulders broadened, chest barreled out and his pecs thickened. “I’m not sure, I think you’ve got everything covered.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Finn was panting as he watched the computer geek explode into a muscular anthro-stallion right before his eyes. Vance’s massive, muscular ass strained his jeans, though all his clothes were growing to keep up with his transformation. A long tail erupted from the base of his spine. <br />
<br />
“Are you satisfied?” Vance asked unexpectedly as his mouth began to elongate, head morphing into a horse’s face. His hair grew into a long, well-groomed mohawk. He brushed some hair out of his muzzle with a toss of his huge head. “I was a nosy dick to you and yet you still gave me exactly what I wanted. Do you want to be a tiny twink fox? I’d love to have you as my teammate, man.”<br />
<br />
“A-aren’t I cute?” Finn stuttered, absolutely shocked. He swished his tail and batted his lashes. “Like, I’m a wet dream, right?”<br />
<br />
“Not into twinks, bro.” Vance shrugged. “Sorry. Maybe that’s your boyfriend’s fetish.” <br />
<br />
“I don’t have a boyfriend!” Finn practically shouted, garnering a few looks from students passing them in the hall. His blushed under his fur and his tail tucked between his legs. “Why do you think I’m gay?”<br />
<br />
“I guess it was just kinda obvious the way you and Jeff look at each other.” Vance rolled his massive shoulders. Finn was having to look up as the horse’s legs lengthened. “I mean, if I’m wrong, let me know. You’ve never had sex with him, right?”<br />
<br />
Finn looked away, blushing, but managed to catch the horseman’s package bulge lewdly as it grew just as large as the rest of him<br />
<br />
“I mean, come on. And the size difference might be hot, until you get down to the reality of the situation. It’s going to be a tight fit down there, is all I’m saying.” Vance shrugged. “Plus, wouldn’t sharing his favorite sport and not just being the guy in the crowd cheering him on be kinda hot?”<br />
<br />
“I…I really don’t feel comfortable discussing this with you.” Finn said and hurried away.<br />
<br />
“Hey, if he had the Chronivac first, what did he change?” Vance called.<br />
<br />
Finn left, but he was starting to think he might need to look into that.</p>
