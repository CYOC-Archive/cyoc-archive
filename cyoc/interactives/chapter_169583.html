<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a small town in rural america there lives a family of 5 a father (Nichola AKA Nick 36), mother (Jane 36), 2 daughters (Melody 18) (Trinity 14) and a son (Gean 16). The males in the family were cursed a long time ago. That when any women of reproductive age sets eye on there exposed penises after the age of 13 would fall madly in love almost excessive with lust turds them and wouldn&#39;t stop till satisfied. No one knew how it started. If it was a witch, a bitter old flame or a guy down in his luck trying to get some love. That didn&#39;t know it would pass down through the generations.  <br />
<br />
Nick and Jane were high school sweet hearts but with his families curse he know he had to be careful so after graduation he proposed to her. Nick and his parents sat with her and her parents a month later to tell them of their families curse. Shown as a common courtesy through the generations and as a warning. They didn&#39;t believe them and needed proof. So reluctantly his father took Jane&#39;s parents to his and his wife&#39;s room. There his father reveled his bare crotch and Jane&#39;s mother lost all control as her husband watched in shock and horror as his wife did unspeakable things he has never seen before or has never done with him. Outside the room Nick&#39;s mother told then they should promptly levee so they didn&#39;t have to hear whats going on in there. they did so but but Jane was still curious so after leaving the house they walked around the block then snuck to his parents bedroom window. Jane looked in the window at her mother having sex with Nick&#39;s dad with a with her father standing there with a terrified look on his face. Quickly after seeing her father expression she walked away and Nick followed. After they were done in the bedroom Jane&#39;s mother kept apologizing to her husband and what he had to go through seeing her like that. A year later Nick and Jane were married. She was 2 months along when the wedding took place with their child. Later everyone was extradite when they found out the gender of the baby was a girl. Because the curse doesn&#39;t pass on to the daughters of the family.<br />
<br />
The present day. Nick hasn&#39;t felt himself in a few days and with Jane by his side he goes to the family physician for some blood work and a checkup. The blood work took a few days and the doctor called him back in with some news. They when in thinking but not hoping it was cancer. The doctor came in the room with a clipboard and a leaflet. He sat down on the stool and told them it wasn&#39;t cancer but it was unheard of in a man his age. The doctor handed him a sheet of paper from the clipboard and the leaflet. Nick and his wife seeing what it is both get shocked looks on their faced. Both unable to talk the doctor told them he had Second Puberty and the people at the lab ran it multiple time to make sure. <br />
<br />
Later at home after getting their nerves together they called a family meeting after supper. Nick and Jane put both their parents on video calls for the meeting with their kids and told them the news. That Nick had Second Puberty and what the doctor told them. That in a matter of 6 to 10 months he would be a girl 16 years of age, have a tan complexion, dirty blond hair, have DD cup breasts, be 5&#39;7, have a higher IQ, some personality changes , that his sexuality would by Bisexual, and have a higher than average libido at his new age. They all had some questions but  a few were lingering. How would the family curse play into all of this. Would I still have it? Could it effect guys? Could it effect him now? Could it effect my transition? Ext. All valid questions we have to figure out together. It was getting late and it was already past midnight so Nick and Jane said good by to their parents and hung up the calls, told the kids to go to bed and that they&#39;d  see them in the morning. Nick and Jane had some questions of there own that were more private and stayed up later talking about them. After their conversation they went to bed as well but Nick sleep. <br />
<br />
In the morning Jane woke up not getting much sleep thinking of what to come of her loving husband. Noticing Nick wasn&#39;t in bed she frantically gets up and looks for him. finding him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in his hand she walks over next to him and sits down at the table. Honey you been up long? she asks. couldn&#39;t sleep at a wink last night. Thinking on what&#39;s going to happen to me what is happening to me. Its kind of funny if you look at it in a way. How so? she asks. there&#39;s another story about my families past that&#39;s past down from father to son once he&#39;s old enough. What&#39;s the story about if I may ask? She says. If you must know it&#39;s about a curse made a few generation after the first. Not sure how many by now. But it goes something like this. The first curse was made from spite and hatred to the men in my family. The second was made by the family to kill the first set upon the family but it was uncontrolled and spread to others. generation after generation the second tries to catch up to the first till its gone. there was a fail safe put in the second one if the first interacts with the second the first one die for good and the second a log with it. What dose that mean? she asks &#39;confused&#39;. From what I get from it and it sounds disgusting to me to but once my changes are complete Gean our son has to have sex with me to finally get rid of the Family Curse and Second puberty. but that also means I&#39;ll be stuck as a girl. Do you know how crazy that makes you sound. She says not understanding a single word coming out of her husbands mouth from what she just heard.<br />
