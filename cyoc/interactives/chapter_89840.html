<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelsey waddled to her clown car, even with the towel she was experiencing jolts of pleasure with every step. Getting into the car she lapsed into thought, she was going to have to find another solution and asking her mom was too embarrassing. Nothing coming to mind she started the car and began to drive to the party just hoping nothing turned her on too much. Finding the right street for the house she turned down it and found it lined with cars and a crowd of people walking into the house. Looking down at the address and back to the house she saw that it was her destination, shrugging she figured it must be a big party. Finding a parking spot was hard and she had to park all the way at the end of the street which resulted in a very damp towel by the time she walked up to the house.<br />
She was met with a loud cheer, applause and laughter as people noticed her walking down the street. Everyone seemed excited to meet the biggest clown in the world. She slowly made her way through the crowd and a flash of blue eyes pulls her up short but looking back she doesn’t see Jay. Breathing a sigh of relief and disappointment she is greeted in the door by a mob of unruly kids hugging her. An older woman comes up next to her.<br />
&quot;Sorry about the crowd but we posted on Facebook that we had Kelsey the world&#39;s biggest clown coming to Stacey birthday party and more people wanted to come.&quot;<br />
&quot;Umm, no problem.&quot; A little girl was tugging on her hand but Kelsey could see her around her tits &quot;I&#39;ll just get started.&quot; The brat finally yanked on her finger hard and Kelsey let lose a loud fart filling the room with cotton candy scent. Laughter erupted around the room and Kelsey was finally able to make it to the front, she tripped and did a summersault to more laughter when she got up there. She started out by telling some jokes and then she noticed the guys lined up at the back of the room. Their eyes were glued to her boobs, every time they jiggled or moved she watched their eyes bounce. She suddenly had the urge to turn suddenly and see if all of them fell over trying to keep track of them but restrained herself. She did need to get some new bras though her tits jingle way too much. She invited Stacey the birthday girl up to help her with some silly magic tricks and then started to do some juggling. Normally she would juggle and purposely drop a ball and have the birthday kid race after it and toss it back to her. This time when she purposely under threw a ball it didn&#39;t drop on the ground it hit her new tits and bounced back up it the air. Kelsey was in shock and automatically caught it and threw it up again, everyone laughed and applaud the move. With new confidence Kelsey did it again to the same reaction and then began to juggle/hacky sack with other parts of her body. She launched one up and bounced it off her nose, then her foot and even over her shoulder and off her big butt. Everyone was laughing and clapping and then she saw him, his blue eyes staring at her across the room, flashing his sweet smile and then she really did drop all the balls. The kids laughed and scrabbled for the balls tossing them back to her. She caught them all, feeling his eyes on her she let out a nervous fart and went on with the show. After singing happy birthday the devil&#39;s spawn, the kids as she like to think of them, dug in to the cake and presents. She turned getting ready to pack up and leave when Jay walked up to her.<br />
&quot;Here let me help you.&quot; Jay bent over and helped her pack up her things. Kelsey just sorta stood there distracted by his good looks.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you would be here.&quot; She finally was able to blurt out. He looked kind of sheepish at her.<br />
&quot;Well I am sort of crashing the party. I saw the post on a facebook and came by and when I saw the crowd I snuck in.&quot; He threw the last couple of things into her bag and stood up.<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like I am stalking you or anything. But you left so quickly after the party yesterday and didn&#39;t return my phone call, I just wanted to see if you were ok.&quot; Kelsey felt herself blushing and knew her face showed it in usual clown fashion. Jay smiled.<br />
&quot;Let me walk you to your car.&quot; Kelsey nodded and they made their way out the door. Jay grabbed her hand as they walked down the street and Kelsey felt herself start to heat up, each step causing the towel and pants to rub her enlarged clit. She started to shake a little bit and Jay looked at her concerned.<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yea I am just really tired. All these birthday parties are wearing me down.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well sounds like you need a break. Why don&#39;t you let me take you out to dinner?&quot; Kelsey heart started to race. &#39;A cute guy is asking me out?&#39; Never did she think a guy would be that interested in her. She could feel a orgasm building in her and prayed she wouldn&#39;t collapse in one in front of Jay. The last few steps to her car were torture as she willed herself not to go over the edge. Throwing the stuff into the car Jay then turned to her.<br />
&quot;Saturday at 7?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; She said looking into his blue eyes. Suddenly the blue eyes were getting closer and she panicked as she realized he was coming in for a kiss. Her back to the car she couldn&#39;t do anything and not really wanting to do anything she met him the rest of the way his cheek brushing past her large nose causing it to honk and sending more shivers down her pre-orgasmic body and his soft lips met hers. The warmth of his lips filled her body and she gripped the car and the whole world fell away, nothing else existed except him in the entire universe. And then it ended and the rest of the world returned.<br />
&quot;See you Saturday&quot; Jay turned and left leaving Kelsey going over the edge. Kelsey turned and crawled into the car and collapsed as the movement sent her over the edge and the biggest clown in the world had another first, having the biggest orgasm in the world. Kelsey let out a scream in the car and quickly covered her mouth to try and muffle it as she watched Jay&#39;s out ass walk down the street. Her eyes went out of focus as her body shook in gratification, waves of bliss rolled over her. For five minutes she sat in her car writhing in pleasure as her orgasm continued. Finally it tapered out and she was left gasping for air as her senses returned. The party was breaking up but nobody had seemed to come by her car and notice a clown orgasming. She reached into her skirt and pulled out the now soaking towel, the smell of sex filling the tiny car, rolling down the window she tosses it out. Smoothing out her apron and started the car to return home. On the way home she passes an athletics store and has a sudden idea and pulls in. Going through the aisles she finally finds what she is looking for and leaves to check out. The checkout person gives her a funny look but shrugs, she is a clown after all. Getting back in the car she removes the athletics cup from the bag and slips it down her panties. Moving around Kelsey feels it protecting her sensitive clit. <br />
After she got home Kelsey suddenly remembered why she had an orgasm. She had a date on Saturday.</p>
