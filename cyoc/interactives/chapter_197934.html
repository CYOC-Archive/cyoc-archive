<br />
<br />
Cole had spent hours in the city library, searching for some very specific books.  She&#39;d acquired a list online of rare books- books that could allow one to conjure a devil from Hell itself!<br />
<br />
So far, she&#39;d had no luck, and it was very frustrating.  She ran a hand through her hair.  Though short, it was thick and glossy, black as a raven&#39;s wing.  She wore a pair of wire-rimmed glasses with circular lenses.  Having been born with heterochromia, her right eye was grey, and her left eye was green.<br />
<br />
People sometimes called her a witch, and she didn&#39;t bother to correct them.<br />
<br />
Cole had only recently turned 17, and slightly above average height, with a slender build earned through a combination of yoga and being a fussy eater.  Her skin was pale, due to a lifelong aversion to sunlight, and that, combined with her love of the color black, made her look like a goth.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t, not really- she had no problems with goth fashions, but her tastes were usually simpler; no elegant lace, fishnets, or platform boots for her, thanks!  Today she wore a medium-length skirt and a t-shirt featuring a stuffed bear that was half-black, and half-white.  The white side of his face was smiling and friendly, while the black side had a razor-toothed grin.<br />
<br />
The character was from an anime she liked, and suited her mood.  She wore a pair of black canvas sneakers, and slipper socks that left her ankles bare.<br />
<br />
She carried a black passenger bag on one shoulder, and it was usually stuffed with books and the usual sorts of things a girl carried in a purse.  She wore a silver pendant on a chain in the shape of Hecate&#39;s Wheel, and on her left hand, a vintage engagement ring- white gold, set with a brown diamond.  The ring was a keepsake from her beloved grandmother, who had passed away a few months prior.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d had to fight with her cousin to claim the ring, despite the fact that Gramma had always promised Cole could have it- Linda had made a huge fuss about it, even going so far as to make posts about it on social media.  As a result, several relatives were convinced she should give the ring up, and wouldn&#39;t shut up about it.<br />
<br />
“Over my dead body”, she murmured.  Suddenly, her eyes were drawn to an old book high on the bookshelf.  Was that it?<br />
<br />
She literally had to climb on the bookshelf to reach it, too excited to go hunt for a ladder or stool.  The bookshelf made some creaking noises, but it held, and she jumped off once the book was in hand, landing in a crouch.<br />
<br />
Yes!  This was it!  “Ye Testament of Dantalyon, 71st Duke of Hell”.  Her hard work having paid off at last, she went to check it (and a few other books she&#39;d acquired) out and headed home.<br />
<br />
<br />
She was so excited that she didn&#39;t bother to eat dinner, instead, grabbing a snack after she took a shower.  Wearing nothing but her bathrobe, she sat on her bed and started reading.  She was skipping her yoga practice, but it couldn&#39;t be helped- this would be the answer to her dreams!<br />
<br />
The book was written in an older dialect of English, and several passages were downright archaic, but she took copious notes as she read.  Finally, she reached the section she was really interested in: an incantation to summon the Duke of Hell, Dantalyon!<br />
<br />
There were a few necessary props, but she had all but one- the magic circle containing the sigil of the demon.  She grabbed her sewing kit and a large, square-shaped piece of high-quality cloth and started to work.<br />
<br />
It was very late and her fingers were tired (and she&#39;d drawn blood more than once), but she finally had the sigil sewn onto the fabric.  She yawned, and wondered if she should take a nap.<br />
<br />
Instead, she padded to the kitchen in her bare feet and made some tea.  Returning to her room, she made her preparations.  She rolled up her throw rugs and spread the cloth out onto her hardwood floor.  She made sure it was smooth, and used masking tape to secure it to the floor.<br />
<br />
Then she made a circle of black candles around it, and lit them, one by one, as she began to chant the incantation softly.  It was a good thing her Mom and Brian, her stepdad, were out of town this week!<br />
<br />
She put on some cello music in the background as she worked.  She uttered the last words of the spell, and...nothing.<br />
<br />
“Damn it!”, she swore in frustration.  “Come on, what does a girl have to do to sell her soul around here?!”<br />
<br />
As if in response, a black flame rose from the circle, though it didn&#39;t burn the cloth.  It grew until it was the height of a man, and a nude figure appeared, holding a black book.<br />
<br />
The entity had the soft, smooth skin of a young girl, but was tall and androgynous.  No breasts, though the hips were wider than a man&#39;s and the waist was narrower as well.  Their body was well-muscled, with long arms and legs, and they had &#39;lady abs&#39;, with prominent pelvic bones (though there was nothing but smooth skin between their legs).  They had long dark hair that seemed blacker than night, and feminine features.  Their eyes were closed, but they slowly opened, to reveal that they were completely black orbs that had twinkling points of light in them, not unlike the night sky.<br />
<br />
The entity regarded Cole for a moment, then spoke.  The voice was a womans, but noticeably low in pitch.  “Nicole Constance Eldridge.  You have called, and I have answered.  What would you have of me?”<br />
<br />
Cole didn&#39;t like being called by her full name, but she wasn&#39;t about to argue with her visitor!  “Oh great Dantalyon, Duke of Hell, I wish to make a pact with you, offering up my soul to you.”<br />
<br />
“In what matter shall I serve, Daughter of Eve?”  Dantalyon&#39;s face remained expressionless.<br />
<br />
“I seek companionship, guidance, and instruction in all things.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
Dantalyon slowly smiled.  “Truly?  Do you think your soul is worth so much of my time?”<br />
<br />
“No, I do not.”  Cole admitted.  “But I feel under your tutelage, I may yet be worthy.”<br />
<br />
The demon didn&#39;t speak for several minutes, and Cole started to feel nervous.  Maybe she should have prepared better?<br />
<br />
Then...<br />
<br />
“Hold up your hand, Daughter Eve.”<br />
<br />
She did as she was told and Dantalyon took it by the wrist.  Their grip was like a steel vice, and Cole gasped.  The demon then leaned forwards and bit into the soft flesh at the base of her thumb, their teeth as sharp as a scalpel.  When the demon relaxed it&#39;s grip, she saw blood on their lips.<br />
<br />
“Your blood is sweet.  You do have potential.  Very well.  I shall serve for a year and a day, and if, by that time, you have not satisfied me with your progress, I shall depart.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d like to give me a little more time?  Perhaps...666 days?”  Cole ventured.<br />
<br />
Dantalyon chuckled.  “Do not push it, Nicole Eldridge.  Now, you must command me to take on a human form.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like for you to become a girl of my age, so you can accompany me everywhere.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
“Is that your only criteria?  Does it matter if I am tall or short, plain or beautiful beyond description?”  Dantalyon smirked.  “I could be anything you desire.”<br />
<br />
Cole blushed.  “I think your current form is quite beautiful, to be honest.  So a maiden similar in appearance would be perfectly fine.”<br />
<br />
Dantalyon shrugged, and began to shrink in size.  Their muscles faded, and their belly became flat and taut instead of muscled.  Small breasts began to form on their chest, and their facial features became softer and younger.<br />
<br />
A vertical slit formed between the demon&#39;s legs, but they didn&#39;t bother to grow pubic hair- nor did they grow body hair anywhere- just eyebrows, lashes, and the long, straight hair growing from their scalp.<br />
<br />
The demon stopped at her height, and despite having wider hips, she (for she was definitely female now) could probably wear her clothes easily.  No doubt, that was the point.<br />
<br />
The girl stepped out of the circle, and the cloth burned to ashes as the candles went out.  She glided past Cole, moving with a natural, easy grace she would kill to possess, and regarded herself in the mirror.  <br />
<br />
Dantalyon weighed her breasts experimentally, and seemed satisfied.  Cole noted that the girl&#39;s behind was perfectly heart-shaped, though not overly large.  She turned her head to face Cole.  “Do I meet with  your satisfaction, Apprentice?”<br />
<br />
Cole gulped.  “You&#39;re a goddess.”<br />
<br />
Dantalyon smiled, showing perfect teeth.  Her eyes began to change color, the sclera turning to white, and the irises becoming a dark blue-violet in color.  If you looked carefully, however, you could still see stars in her pupils.  “Thank you for the compliment.  So you are a girl who prefers her own gender, I take it?”<br />
<br />
Cole frowned.  “Mostly, but it&#39;s a little more complicated than that.”<br />
<br />
The girl moved to sit on Cole&#39;s bed.  She patted the comforter.  “Come, sit, and tell me more.  Or does my nakedness distract you?”<br />
<br />
“No, it&#39;s fine.  Just don&#39;t expect me to take off my robe.  I feel pretty plain right now.”<br />
<br />
“Tch.  You are not plain.  It would be a simple matter for me to make someone fall in love with you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks...I think.”  Cole sat on the bed, facing the demoness.  <br />
<br />
“Now then, tell me your heart&#39;s desire.  What manner of lover causes your heart to race, your breath to quicken?”<br />
<br />
Cole sighed.  “An impossible one, I&#39;m afraid.  My...kink...is unusual.”<br />
<br />
Dantalyon laughed.  “Oh come now!  I have seen many bizarre and forbidden lusts, Cole.  Do you lust for a woman with a man&#39;s member?  Or with both?  A four-legged creature that can fornicate with itself?  Or a woman so tiny and small she could crawl into your nether regions and make love to you from inside your body?”<br />
<br />
Cole shivered, as some of those things sounded -interesting-, if not exactly arousing.  “I guess it&#39;s not that strange, then.  Those are all things?”<br />
<br />
“They are, indeed, things.  That and much, much more.  I know the ways of the heart and mind better than most, and there are untold perversions you have yet to glimpse.”<br />
<br />
“Well.”  Cole got up from her bed and went to her bookshelf, selecting a well-read volume of manga.  She went over and showed it to the demoness.  “So this is a story about a young man who falls in love with a girl, but due to a curse, he is transformed into a beautiful woman.”<br />
<br />
Dantalyon flipped through the pages.  “So, what you are saying is...”<br />
<br />
“I am aroused by the idea of a man who has been transformed into a pretty girl.”  She blushed, looking down.<br />
<br />
“And learning how to do this is something you want, I take it?”  Dantalyon set the manga aside, to finish later.<br />
<br />
“Among other things.”  Cole admitted.  “I have no idea...how it would actually go.  I mean, I&#39;d have to find a guy who wanted to become a girl...and would then be attracted to me...”<br />
<br />
“Or, you could just transform a boy and seduce him.”  Dantalyon pointed out.  “Much simpler, no?”<br />
<br />
“Ah...yes, there is that...and...fuck that makes me horny as hell thinking about it.  But I&#39;m not very...seductive...”<br />
<br />
“Easy to remedy.”  The demon said.<br />
<br />
“And if I did this to someone against their will...would they really love me?  Or would it be a terrible lie?”<br />
<br />
“Ah.  Well it&#39;s true, I can make anyone fall in love, but real love, based on truth, is the best.  You are a romantic, Nicole Eldridge.”<br />
<br />
“Could you...call me Cole?  I never liked the name Nicole.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, Cole.  You know, I can be man or woman, you could lay with me if you wanted.  I can teach you much.”<br />
<br />
She sighed.  “Believe me, I&#39;ve been thinking about it.  But something isn&#39;t quite right- I guess it&#39;s because you&#39;re not either, really.”<br />
<br />
“It is true.  None of my kind were born with gender, the Fallen.  We assume genders, but only a few of us have managed to assume one gender or the other.  Most exist in between, sometimes male, sometimes female.  As for myself...I&#39;ve never been able to think of myself as either.”<br />
<br />
“Are you an Ace, then?”<br />
<br />
“Asexual?  No, not really.  I have sex.  It&#39;s even enjoyable.  But I don&#39;t...desire it.  Or seek it out.”<br />
<br />
Cole nodded.  “There are people like that.  Among humans.  It can be hard.”<br />
<br />
“Despite that, I am fond of physical intimacy beyond sexual.  So for the duration of your apprenticeship, I would like to share your bed.  Are you averse to...cuddling?”<br />
<br />
Cole shook her head, blushing.  “No.  Not at all.”<br />
<br />
“Good.  Don&#39;t worry about your family, I can make myself invisible and intangible to them, so only you can interact with me.  I will reveal myself only when it is time for us to go to school, or if I come by to &#39;visit&#39;.”  <br />
<br />
“Oh, can you drive?  I don&#39;t have a car.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
“I can do most things, you will find.  I will have to arrange for a vehicle.  Now, you are tired.”  The demoness rose, folded back the covers, then slid into bed, still naked. <br />
<br />
Cole turned out the lights and slipped out of her robe, getting into bed with the demon, who put her arms around her in a comfortable embrace.<br />
<br />
“Oh, we&#39;ll need a name for you.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
Dantalyon got comfortable, nuzzling Cole&#39;s hair.  “Lee Anne Dante.”<br />
<br />
Cole giggled.  “Ah, that&#39;s easy to remember...Lee.”<br />
<br />
“Good.  I&#39;m glad you approve.  Now....SLEEP.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Cole slept, and dreamed,   In her dreams, she came across a confused girl, much shorter than she was, wearing oversized boy&#39;s clothing.  The girl looked confused and upset, and Cole helped them up and gave their hand a gentle squeeze...</p>
