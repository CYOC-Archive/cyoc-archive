<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brooke and her boyfriend took the bracelets and put them on. Almost instantly they both felt a change in their crotch.<br />
<br />
He had a rather large endowment as it was and his balls were softball size.<br />
<br />
Brooke on the other hand had a rather average pussy.<br />
<br />
But Brooke wasn&#39;t ready for the change in testosterone and as they went out the door she took him into an alley and immediately fucked him.<br />
<br />
He moaned in pleasure from the stretching of his new pussy.<br />
<br />
And Brooke&#39;s eyes rolled back in her head as she came for the first time with a cock.<br />
<br />
They had to split up at that time but she was still so very horny. And he found that he was still waiting to orgasm since she was so quick with the sex.<br />
<br />
He walked down the street and although not gay he went by a gay bar. He couldn&#39;t get any of his friends to fuck him with his temporary pussy so he thought maybe he could get one of they guys to fuck him.<br />
<br />
This was going to be weird.<br />
<br />
Entering he saw very few men in there in the middle of the day but he went up to the bar and started off a conversation with the bartender.<br />
<br />
He was quite hansom. He started to share the need for sex. But hadn&#39;t explained why he needed it.<br />
<br />
As the bartender took him to the back he was repulsed when he saw that he had a pussy.<br />
<br />
So he had to explain why.<br />
<br />
Now the bartender wasn&#39;t a prude he just didn&#39;t like women parts.<br />
<br />
So he suggested the biker rally at the edge of town. He thought about it and even though he was scared he went out and found that they were very willing to use him.<br />
<br />
But not so easy as he was expecting.<br />
<br />
He was tied down with a blindfold on and for hours he was fucked by all sorts of bikers. He came not just once but so many times that his nipples tingled.<br />
<br />
When he was released and headed back to see Brooke he found he no longer had his bracelet.<br />
<br />
When he met up with Brooke he found that she too had lost her bracelet.<br />
<br />
And the amazing thing was that she had gone to the biker rally and she fucked the array of cum dumps at the rally one of which was her boyfriend even though his face was covered and she didn&#39;t realize that it was him.<br />
<br />
They both began to panic as they thought they would be trapped like that but a few days later there was a magic snap and the bracelets had been run over by a biker and smashed into smithereens. <br />
<br />
They almost instantly had their own body parts back.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t the biggest problem. Her boyfriend was pregnant. And not just a little. He had taken so much cum up his pussy and all that was now trapped in his womb.<br />
<br />
It was encased in his body protected by the spell from being absorbed, expelled or deteriorating.<br />
<br />
He was pregnant with several men&#39;s babies along with his girlfriends child. There were half a dozen babies in his womb and as they grew it looked like he had quite the sizable beer belly.<br />
<br />
As they realized what was happening to his body he stopped drinking and it was all babies at that point. His pecs became tits filled with milk and when the nine months rolled around and he had his babies they had to come out some way and his ass never felt so stretched. <br />
<br />
Exhausted from giving birth to the half dozen babies he rested while Brooke decided what to do with the babies.<br />
<br />
As he slept the pouch deep inside of him opened up releasing just enough cum to once again impregnate him again.<br />
<br />
His now deflated belly looked bad on him but it soon began to inflate again but his breasts remained large. <br />
<br />
It would take years for the pouch to release all the stored cum but the affects on his body would be quite noticeable. And Brooke made a tidy profit on the babies she would adopt out.</p>
