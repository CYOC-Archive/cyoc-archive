<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">George got to the dining hall before anyone other than the cooking staff. A buxom cow was directing two other cooks, a rooster and a ewe as they set out the morning meal. George was favored with a radiant smile by Chef Gracie as everyone called her. One of the oldest members of staff at the ripe old age of just twenty-eight, she was kind of an unofficial camp mother. Charlie and Cindy, her assistants likewise greeted George with nods. Not being counselors, the three rarely left the kitchen, working morning to evening to make sure everyone got fed three meals and one snack every day. It also meant everyone was infallibly nice to them as the sole providers of food.<br />
<br />
The other way it paid off being nice was Chef Gracie slipped him a bowl of fruit and yogurt to chow down on, otherwise he&#39;d have to wait to eat last until all the other campers and counselors were fed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Todd this morning?&quot; She asked, holding up his banana laced oatmeal.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s running a little late, I&#39;ll hold that for him.&quot; Gracie&#39;s special treats were the only good thing about having to work the serving line for a meal. She always seemed to have something special on hand for those counselors. She relinquished it to his care as he set up behind the serving line. Halfway through scarfing his meal, Todd finally arrived, pinning on his name tag that proudly read:<br />
<br />
TODD GREENTREE<br />
Counselor<br />
<br />
Counselor, not junior counselor. Fucking monkey. Of course as a junior counselor he had to be paired up with a more senior one. It was just his luck Todd was it. He made even the stupid camp uniform look good. The way the shorts hugged his back side and the shirt showed off his v-tapered torso. Even the scarf around his neck looked more like a fashion choice. He felt his cock chubbing up in his shorts again and looked away, focusing on his breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oatmeal!&quot; Todd said with a cheery tone as he picked up his breakfast and began to scarf it down. They finished just in time for Alex to open up the dining hall doors and let the first of the campers in. Finally, there was something for George to focus on other than Todd. Really, the campers could serve themselves. The two of them were there to make sure no one took too much of anything, and that everyone at least took some healthy things like fruit.<br />
<br />
George actually enjoyed talking to the campers. He hated kids. He had always hated kids, but here he found it ease to talk to them, knew many of them by name and somehow found it easy to make them smile and laugh as they came through the line. Todd even laughed at some of his corny jokes to the kids, which just made George blush.<br />
<br />
But there was something else he was noticing as the line passed through, especially as a female kangaroo counselor with short black hair and a killer pair of breasts, her shirt tied up to reveal a trim flat belly, passed by. If George had been into animal girls before that was just the type he would have gone for. Hell, make her human and she practically was one of his college exes. She did nothing for him.<br />
<br />
He started looking at each female counselor as she passed by, willing his body to give him some sign of attraction. Nothing. Worse, some of the male counselors got his nose twitching and his eyes kept sliding over to them, even the head counselor Alex who was striding around to the various counselors and giving them their assignments for the day. But none affected him like Todd.  Todd was.. well.. perfect.<br />
<br />
Not only had this stupid camp turned him into a teenaged rabbit, but it made him into a gay one with a monkey fetish. Almost like it knew George and Todd hated each other and with a sick sense of humor was now trying to push them together. He scowled downwards at the empty tray in front of him, only to finally notice there was no more line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Swiftlegs.&quot; George blinked and looked over to Todd who was gathering up trays. &quot;Not doing this alone, George.&quot; He snapped out of it and started cleaning up the line as Alex made his way over to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys!&quot; The badger consulted his clipboard. &quot;As always, breakfast duty means you&#39;re off for the first period. Then I need you both down at the obstacle course until lunch. Something wrong, George?&quot;<br />
<br />
George realized he had been scowling again then schooled his features and shook his head. &quot;Sorry, just thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, get this all cleaned up and enjoy your hour rest period.&quot; And then Alex was back off on his rounds.<br />
<br />
George sighed and went back to work, following Todd&#39;s lead as they cleaned up the trays and brought them back into the kitchen for Charlie and Cindy to wash.</p>
