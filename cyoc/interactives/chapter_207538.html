<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before long, Danielle&#39;s newfound lust became known widely. All the satyrs found her enthusiasm charming and Danielle was only willing to reciprocate and give back in kind. The man still in him cursed the genie but also wondered why he found sex so irresistible as a female. Was it because he now was a nymph? Because the satyrs were campions in doing the deed? Because the genie had also altered his mind? He didn&#39;t know but the rest of his mind didn&#39;t care. The satyrs performed for the genie but the more they possessed nymph to love, the better they were. The genie had been right on that. Worse, when Danielle wanted to call out to her and plead her to give him back his humanity and above all virile attributes, she waved him away, told her she got what she deserved and asked the satyrs to help this poor little nymph to get her mind off matters that were not her concerns any more. The satyrs were only too happy to oblige, using that pretext to get Danielle to orgasm many times and to discover further what turned her on and get her even more receptive. <br />
<br />
The extremely spacious park the genie let her satyrs live in was always warm and it was only an autumn like the end of a summer in the worst months of the year. Besides, as Danielle was a human changed into a nymph, the genie had chosen her appearance and made her as attractive as possible. Danielle, renamed Amalthea because of her beauty had extraordinary chestnut-colored wavy locks, the poutiest lips imaginable and a tiny waist coupled with bouncy big boobs and round firm buttocks coupled to tanned skin reflecting a life lived under the sun and bursting with health. Amalthea resented her sexual pleasures but they were so hard to resist! And the satyrs knew how to use their genitalia and sexual prowess! Amalthea soon learned how to pleasure the satyrs as much as possible. After all, the hardest their members got, the more pleasurable it was for her! And the fastest too! Even their smell was strangely attractive, and Amalthea quickly saw no shame in inhaling the musky scent produced their hair in their erogenous areas and more human areas with pilosity like their underarms or groin. She could inhale deeply their pubes before thanking them with a fellatio. The satyrs themselves saw nothing wrong with her complete lack of body hair, including her crotch. Indeed, it allowed for them to see her labia and clitoris fully. The other nymphs were no different in that regard and Amalthea could not imagine a return of body hair as when she had been a male. On a female, it sounded repulsive and a soft skin was so much nicer! The scalp hair of satyrs were the best to put her nose into yet approaching her olfactive organ so near the armpits of a satyr, or right next to one as caresses and kisses were exchanged was a delight.<br />
<br />
The other nymphs did the same and soon Amalthea surrounded to the pleasures of the flesh provided. Overwhelmed by sensual desires and rewards, letting go of a male identity didn&#39;t seem so bad. If she kept it, it brought only more conflict and problems. Very soon, the genie stopped being pestered by her newest nymph. And very soon, the good looks of Amalthea attracted the kings of the satyrs. The best musician indeed, but also the biggest, raunchiest and lustful. He seldom got out of his large cave, only having intercourse with a usual nymph once in a while because he focused on his art but when he saw the new arrival, his pent-up sexual urges brutally came to the forefront, as if her sight had made them arise tenfold. She was the prettiest he had ever seen! And such prowess! The way she adorably kissed the penis of one of his brethren while fondling his testes, all the while promising him a massage and sweet words of love in his later on, while he would sip on a cup of wine and lie down on soft grass! His desire for her became urgent cravings! He had to have her. The simple thought of caressing her made his penis bulge even more and he was sure he could feel his testicles fill even more with semen. <br />
<br />
So as soon as his kin was done with his love-making, he wasted in time in approaching her. She laid eyes on him and her expression passed from curiosity to astonishment and awe. And with reason, as his loincloth by that point could barely cover his virile member. She would see how much effect she had on him. A tremendous effect. The king of satyrs, Ramelius as he was named, was impressive, with bulging muscles that denoted a strength to reckon with. Moreover, his scent smacked of virility and desire to impose himself in all ways possible. It was hard to believe such beautiful music could come from him too. The secrets of carnal knowledge were fully known to him as well. Yet in all his many, many years had he felt such burning passion, such intense love for a nymph. The beautiful nymph, Amalthea, looked at him and she understood what he wanted. She wanted to offer it to him fully, intrigued by the bulging mystery his loincloth hid. She herself left absolutely nothing to the imagination. He introduced himself and Amalthea bowed.<br />
&quot;An honor, my king. How may I oblige you?&quot;<br />
Oh, her pouty lips in movement! A delight to witness! And to imagine them ministering to his erect penis... Just he thought made him almost let a moan escaper his lips in anticipation! And the saucy twinkle in her eyes made him know that she was fully aware of what she could do to oblige him. <br />
<br />
So Ramelius wasted no time and scooped her in his arms, bridal style, eliciting a surprised giggle from her soft throat. Her voice was just as charming as the rest of her body! Obviously such perfection had been created by his genie employer and he&#39;d have to thank her for such an awesome specimen. She was a real dream! He kissed those perfect lips and she answered him with her own kisses and ministrations, complimenting him about his amazing physique, stroking his chest appreciatively. Ramelius could hardly wait to have his member receive the same treatment...<br />
He took her back to his cave and upon his bed made of sturdy reeds and simple sheets, they made passionate love. He didn&#39;t last long before ejaculating but after so much tension, releasing had to occur at some point. It was hard to restrain himself. Luckily, his pats on her ample butt cheeks, boobs and crotch had her cum in no time and penetrating her was a wonderful act. After that first release, he could take his time and there were many more. His penis being licked and kissed felt like an ultimate fantasy come true, even when she combed his pubic hair with attention started her smooches anew, delicately stroking his penis while treating it like a living thing that required care and much love. She even took it between her breasts to offer it a time of comfort, as she put it. She then poured wine between her thighs and crotch while crouching on the floor and he drank avidly. It was then slices of bacon on her boobs and slices of fruits on her feet and armpits. He ate everything with relish and nibbled on her nipples to express his gratitude at such a fine meal. This aroused both of them yet again and the sex resumed to last all through the night.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Ramelius announced his new wife to all and everyone cheered and clapped. Even the genie. None of the other nymphs were jealous. Amalthea would have sex with the other satyrs if she so desired and the king would satisfy all nymphs that wished to. They merely had priority over each other as a couple. Besides, Amalthea was the most beautiful and most talented in the art of pleasuring satyrs so such a union would be quite expected, really. And as a sign of her new role of consort, she wore a delicate gold necklace with ewes and goats and jenny asses engraved, all with overflowing teats and ears pricked in attention, that of sexual desire, obviously. Ramelius wore a similar design on a belt, with rams and sheep possessing a penis in erection, both jewels gifted by the genie in person. The only real difference was the presence of horses instead of donkeys but that suited him fine. He knew the reason behind that. Amalthea had been a silly human, no doubt a boy behaving as a jackass. It was subtle reminder and he appreciated the humor. Not that he cared, really, when he saw the result! The reference, though, went over Amalthea&#39;s head who had by now buried all thoughts of his previous life. There were a lot more fun things to think about now, after all.</p>
