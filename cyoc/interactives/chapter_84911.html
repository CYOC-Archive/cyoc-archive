<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John wasn&#39;t entirely comfortable with all that had happened, but he did accept Jabarii&#39;s apology and accepted his promise that they wouldn&#39;t remain as they were now forever. At the same time, something told him that Derrick and Julie were safe. John didn&#39;t know what that was, he seemed to accept it, and for the moment, something in Sharon&#39;s scent was enticing. She smelled very good... sexually good and John felt his member responding accordingly.<br />
<br />
In his arms, Sharon, found it hard to look to some of the things. Instead she found her mind dwelling on John&#39;s transformed body. He had changed so much, and that had nothing to do with his species, and it wasn&#39;t a bad change. In fact, it was a good change as far as she was concerned, and it was likely to put the &quot;spark&quot; back in their marriage. Now, Sharon and John had no real marital troubles. John was hard working and a devoted father, and Sharon&#39;s beauty had long been enough to insure that John would never need to look at another woman, and when they were newlyweds the two of them had actually attracted police attention for being a little... loud... in their love making. But then things changed. Derrick and Julie were born, and Sharon found herself busy with midnight feedings, diaper changes, breakfasts, lunches, parent teacher conferences, sports practices, choir concerts, school projects. John was there for a lot of that too, and becoming good parents had taken a lot out of their love life. <br />
<br />
Then came things at John&#39;s work. He worked hard, but it also took a lot of responsibility. Sharon remembered him telling her once on how he got the promotion to the position he was in. Around the time that Julie was born, John worked in a low level position in the company he worked at. One day he came across an accounting error that he investigated. It turned out that his boss had been embezzling company money and the accounting error was actually an attempt to cover up the embezzlement. In catching the guy, the company promoted John, but while the promotion brought enough money that they could live in a good neighborhood on what was a solid middle class income and that Sharon didn&#39;t have to hold down a job if she didn&#39;t want to, the promotion also brought John longer hours, greater responsibilities, and more work. John did everything he could to be there for Derrick and Julie, and did a good job at that, but this commonly meant that on nights when they had sleep overs or were at friends&#39; houses and they did have the time... John was simply too tired. There were times that he certainly wanted to... but was too tired to really focus...<br />
<br />
And all of that had lead to stress. John put on a little weight and Sharon ended up throwing herself into &quot;mom mode.&quot; It created some rumors at home that Sharon didn&#39;t need her fat husband because she had some stud on the side. But they didn&#39;t know that the outward signs of stress had all been to be good parents. Sharon had no other men and John wasn&#39;t consoling himself in food over supposed infidelity.<br />
<br />
And as John carried her toward the bed, Sharon almost wanted those gossip queens to see John now. True he was covered in tan fur with a brownish-brown mane and leonine tail, but all his fat was gone and his muscle mass was far greater than it had ever been, even when he was young.  Then as Sharon adjusted herself in John&#39;s arms, she felt something poke her the butt. Even through her own fur, she could tell that it was not covered in fur, that it was covered only in very sensitive skin, and it was larger than anything she remembered poking her. She knew what it was and felt her nipples harden.<br />
<br />
&quot;John...&quot; Sharon gave a playful smirk, &quot;is that a penis in your sheath, or are you just happy to see me?&quot;<br />
<br />
John lay her on what was their bed and that was when Sharon could see large pink member standing fully erect from the sheath between her husband&#39;s legs. The rod was more than ready and John began to climb onto the bed. Sharon brought her knees up spread her legs slightly and she smiled as John brought his muzzle up to her own opening, which was growing wet with arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is my penis,&quot; John gave a confident smile, &quot;and I AM happy to see you... and smell you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; Sharon asked and then gave a load moan as John gave her a very sensual lick. &quot;ooooOOOAAAAAAAARRRRMMMM!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you smell ready,&quot; John said to her and began to crawl forward, licking the fur on her belly and working his way up to her breasts. It only made Sharon moan even more. &quot;Ready for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Sharon moaned slowly, desire clear in her voice. After years of largely forced celibacy due to family schedules and work schedules and issues with people doubting the strength of their marriage, Sharon was more than ready to let everyone know that the fire in their marriage had never burned out. And at the same time, she felt a very strong need. It wasn&#39;t something emotional, but something more. It was like she needed John at that moment, but she didn&#39;t know what it was for the moment. All that mattered was getting John&#39;s greatly enlarged penis inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take me, John,&quot; Sharon urged as she brought the calves of her legs to wrap around her husband, &quot;Take me please... I need you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Sharon,&quot; John said to her as he began to guide his member into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohhhhhaaaaarrrrrrm.... I... love... you... too...&quot; Sharon moaned back as she felt John enter her, his size greatly stretching her in a way that felt &quot;oh so good.&quot; He pushed all the way in and then began to pull out shortly and then thrust back in. Sharon found herself in complete ecstasy as she began to thrust her own hips forward and felt her breasts bounce on her chest as John&#39;s thrusts <br />
<br />
&quot;After... unngh...so... uuNNNGGGH... LONG... IT... OOOOORRRROOAAAR... FEELS... GOOD!&quot; John moaned, his voice growing more into a pleasure filled roar Julie&#39;s thrusts perfectly countered his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... oh... yes,&quot; Sharon answered as she felt John&#39;s hands softly rub her breasts as he thrust into her and flicked her erect nipples with one finger. It all felt so good to her and she couldn&#39;t hold in how good she felt, and she gave a command to her husband, her own voice gaining volume as she did so, &quot;harder... John... fuck me... hhhhaaaaaaaaaAAARRRRRRRRDEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRR! HHHHHHHHHHHAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!<br />
<br />
John obeyed and thrust harder into his wife. She needed him and he was all to eager to give her what she needed. And the pleasure of Sharon&#39;s inner folds gripping his penis quite firmly he also felt his moans pleasure grow louder and louder. It all felt so good to him, and he had share how good he felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;OHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMMM... YES... I&#39;M... I&#39;M... I&#39;M...&quot; John gave a moan as he felt his penis twitch inside his wife. He was getting close, he could feel it.<br />
<br />
&quot;SO... SO... AM... I...&quot; Sharon moaned back with equal volume, &quot;CUM... CUM... CUM IN... ME... JOHN... CUM...IN... ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon squeezed with her legs so that she held John fully inside hir and wrapped her arms around him and dug her fingers into his mane. If she scratched him, she didn&#39;t notice and given the growing twitch in John&#39;s penis, John didn&#39;t notice either. Then came the sensation she was truly longing for. The walls of her vagina clamped around John&#39;s penis and she came. At the same time, she felt John erupt inside her, with far greater force and volume than anything she remembered when they were human, and the both of them announced very loudly how good the orgasm felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;RRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOO!&quot; echoed through their hotel room and quite possibly into the hotel and outside as well. John and Sharon lay there for a moment in a very happy afterglow and figured that Julie and Derrick had any questions, they could always come up with something... the fact that their children didn&#39;t gain the mentality of children despite their physical changes. Mentally, Derrick was still 15 and Julie 14 (though this was John and Sharon&#39;s thoughts on their children. As with Derrick and Julie, their own ignorance of the hotel&#39;s &quot;fine print&quot; meant that they didn&#39;t notice that their children changed genders and that Derrick was now essentially Julie and Julie was now essentially Derrick... until their vacation ended anyway).<br />
<br />
&quot;That felt very good, John,&quot; Sharon spoke as they recovered, &quot;You were an animal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So were you,&quot; John gave a reply, &quot;and... and that felt better than anything we did before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would almost make you wish we could stay like this after we go back... eh?&quot; Sharon commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not go THAT far, dear,&quot; John answered, &quot;but I would be wiling to come here every time I get vacation time... and maybe to do more to get in shape back at home... maybe see if I can train some one to assist me at work... so that I can care to you and all your needs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... John,&quot; Sharon said happily and nuzzled the tip of her muzzle to John&#39;s.</p>
