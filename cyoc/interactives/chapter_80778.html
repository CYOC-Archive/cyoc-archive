<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry walked into the living room and saw Jack sitting on the couch. Rather than his usual lazing <br />
position, he was on the edge of his seat with his jaw open, staring intently at the TV.<br />
<br />
	He finally took notice of Henry and motioned him over frantically. Henry sat on the couch, now burning <br />
to know what all the commotion is about.<br />
<br />
	Henry saw a female reporter, who looked to be in about her mid to late 30's and of Asian descent.  <br />
Behind her, it was like hell had broken loose, people were scrambling and dashing about in the background, <br />
looking awfully desperate to escape something. The camera was not focused on the chaos behind her so it was <br />
very difficult for Henry  to see the details, but he swore he saw several round, metallic objects hovering <br />
above the crowds of people. They appeared to be firing bright-green lasers at anyone and everything. The <br />
camera focused on the large crowd behind the reporter. The lasers made contact with several people in the <br />
crowd; large clouds of smoke burst forth from their hunched over forms and something didn't seem right about <br />
the shapes of these people as the smoked began to clear. Unfortunately, Henry was unable to see just what the <br />
problem was because the camera shakily shifted its focus to the reporter once more. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Aerie Tomokono here! The city of Nohaven is under attack by what seem to be hundreds of strange, <br />
robotic, flying objects! There seems to be no reason behind these brutal attacks and we are still unsure of <br />
what this things are or why they are here!&quot;<br />
<br />
	There was a scream and the camera panned out to a grassy field in order to focus on the source of the <br />
screaming. What the camera was documenting was horrifying. The distressing wail was coming from a 40-<br />
something, out of shape woman dressed in a casual business suit. As she was sprinting away from one of the <br />
metallic terrors, she tripped on her own heels and the robot managed to line up a perfect shot on the woman. <br />
She was suddenly covered in a shroud of smoke.<br />
<br />
	Thanks to the incredible detail of the camera, Henry was able to make out a perfect silhouette of the <br />
woman. Her body pulsed and writhed, clearly growing larger, her heels suddenly shot out of the cloud, tattered <br />
and ruined. Things bulged where they shouldn't have bulged and her body, by now, was clearly not that of a <br />
slightly pudgy woman. The smoke cleared and the “woman” emerged, shuddering as her body widened one last time, <br />
completing its change. What emerged from the smoke was not a woman at all but a clown, and male one at that! <br />
It was the cliched white-face type, with a rainbow colored afro, shining, red nose as well as various clothing <br />
and accessories that were typical of a clown. The lumbering clown fell and quickly turned the fall into an <br />
over exaggerated yet acrobatic tumble. The clown came out of its tumble, continuing its run across the field, <br />
its movements greatly exaggerated and humorous, as he pulled off a poor attempt at being terrified by his <br />
surroundings. Even its &quot;cries&quot; of terror sounded unbelievable, like he was performing for a child's birthday <br />
party.<br />
<br />
	&quot;As you just witnessed, these things are changing people! There does not seem to be an exact pattern <br />
as to what they're being changed into. However, two patterns are clearly visible: the affected people always <br />
change gender, and they seem to transform into stereotypical forms of races, professions, or lifestyles! No <br />
solid evidence has been discovered, but these changes may also affect the mind of the people changed. <br />
Fortunately the robots seem to keep away from anyone under the age of 18 but...&quot;<br />
<br />
	The reporter stopped when she heard a high pitched whine behind her. She turned to see one of the very <br />
same robots she was just speaking of. The robot did not hesitate when it fired a laser directly into her <br />
abdomen, which quickly swelled to a great size. Her light skinned, Asian complexion darkened into something <br />
more suiting of a black skinned individual. Her small frame, throbbed and expanded steadily, her shoulders <br />
bursting through her formal coat, broadening to an extreme size. Her womanly figure was consumed by large <br />
amounts of extra muscle and fat, her breasts sinking into her widening chest. Her now massive body burst <br />
through her clothes, leaving her in nothing but a headdress and loincloth, which began to twitch and tent with <br />
the growth of male genitals. The final changes took place as strange bone piercings appeared out of thin air. <br />
The form that had emerged was clearly that of an African tribesman, who held some sort of position of power. <br />
His primitive dress and large belly were clear signs of this, and his meager loincloth did little to conceal <br />
his large endowments. After coughing out the remaining smoke, he assumed a regal demeanor different from the <br />
Asian reporter's neutral one, and lifted one end of a bone club that replaced the microphone to his mouth.<br />
<br />
	When he spoke, an incomprehensible series of clicks and whistles came out. A few seconds of this and a <br />
look of realization appeared across his face. He tried speaking again, looking conflicted with what came out <br />
and his attempts to sound out his words were all but futile. Eventually the effort managed to yield something:<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ck-k...kh..khalp...kmk...me.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Suddenly an earsplitting *boom* was heard. The camera swiveled toward the sound, looking for the <br />
source of the noise. Out from behind one of the buildings came an old man riding in a vehicle equivalent to <br />
that of a Segway, he had replaced the wheels with some peculiar looking hovering devices. He was wearing a <br />
scientist's lab coat that just managed to cover his feet and long, black gloves adorned his forearms. He had <br />
black goggles and eccentric white hair to complete the look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahahahahhahahahahhah! You all made fun of me for being different! You never look at my accomplishments, my <br />
masterpieces! Now... Now my work shall come to you and the whole world will see the fruits of my labor! <br />
Ahahahahahhaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Well he had the evil scientist laugh down at least. One of the hovering robots appeared in front of <br />
the camera and the feed was cut.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Henry! What do we do?! I don't think we can run from those things! We're screwed man, we're screwed!&quot;</p>
