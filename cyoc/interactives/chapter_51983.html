<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That sounds like it would be fun.  I still have a lot of questions,&quot; Kendra said.  &quot;But I should ask my parents first.  And I'd like to go home and talk to them first...and find out which one is the merperson.&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;It would be...nice to know.  To be honest with them, now that I know that I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Lisa said with an understanding smile.  &quot;I didn't realize earlier that your parents didn't know, of course.  I never had to come out to my parents.  They sort of had to come out to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
April laughed.  &quot;I've got you both beat.  My closet is a double.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh, Kendra.  Mermaid.  Lesbian.  My parents don't know either.  What would I tell them?  Oh, my once-royal friend who is also a mermaid, who was once a guy, turned me into a mermaid because we had sex.  Also, I like girls.  That wouldn't be a pleasant afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra laughed along with Lisa, but she felt uncomfortable a moment later.  April didn't know.  Lisa didn't know.  Well, they knew that she was a mermaid, but they didn't know that she was a lesbian as well.  It wasn't something that she had ever expected or planned for.  But in her junior year, she had been together with a girl that she had met at a party.  At first, they'd started kissing because they wanted to get attention.  But they had started to get into it, and both had realized that they were starting to enjoy it.  And Kendra had never really had a steady boyfriend...oh, she had dated boys before of course, but none of them had ever really done it for her.  And then she'd met the girl at the party, and they'd been together for awhile.  But it hadn't ended so well.  They'd had...sex together a few times.  And then Kendra had found out the girl was doing drugs, and sleeping around with other people.  So she had broken it off with her.  She had gone out with a few other girls, that she met at clubs and parties, but none of them lasted very long.  Usually just long enough for a night of casual sex, and then they stopped talking. <br />
<br />
And then, just after her seventeenth birthday, Kendra had started her first transformation.  When she learned that she had to do it everyday through trial and error, she had stopped going out.  No more dating, she had decided.  Not with a tail, not if someone found out about her and thought she was a freak.  And it was just as well - knowing what she knew now, if she had kept going out with girls and if she'd had sex with any of them...they would've turned into mermaids as well.  Just like April had.  <br />
<br />
April...<br />
<br />
If it was true, that April was another lesbian, and another mermaid as well...well...that would change everything.  They could be together, because April knew, and she wasn't in danger.  Except for the sex - they would both end up permanently transformed, save for having to go through a ritual, and Kendra wasn't sure she wanted that to happen.  But they could still be together...if April wasn't already involved with Lisa, anyway.  From the looks of it, the two of them were already close.  Of course, she had been close with Lisa, albeit briefly, so who knew.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't have to worry about all of these things, Kendra thought to herself angrily.  Being a mermaid is enough for one life!<br />
<br />
She sighed.<br />
<br />
They spent the next hour and a half swimming around, waiting until Kendra's parents would get home, and for their pleasure-induced transformations to wear off.  Kendra had never had a transformation last that long without participating in it willingly.  It was a little weird and frightening to realize that she couldn't transform back if she wanted to.  Oh, she was having fun, and it was nice to swim around and splash the others, but it was still a little weird.<br />
<br />
She kept brushing up against April.  At first, it was unintentional, and then, intentional.  Sort of.  She kept glancing at April, and then they'd go underneath the water, and she'd angle for her...and their tails would meet, or they'd touch skin, for just a moment.  Nothing overt.  She wasn't even sure if April knew.  April glanced at her a few times, but didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
Mostly, they all just talked as they normally did.  About school.  About TV shows.  What they wanted to do when they were older.  Gossip about others at school.  Lisa and April talked about the swim team.  Kendra told them about the ways she'd been keeping it a secret.<br />
<br />
The transformation reversal happened over that time.  It was subtle at first, but over time, their breasts got smaller, less pronounced.  Well, it was a little hard to tell with Lisa.  Her breasts were already fairly large, and that was before they had grown.  April wasn't so bad either, but Lisa was the biggest - which was ironic, considering her past.  Eventually, April went to the side of the pool and spent a minute or so hoisting herself up to the deck.  She managed to push herself up and roll over, laughing and panting, as Lisa and Kendra laughed too.  Then, April concentrated for a moment, and her tail began to twist and split apart, becoming two legs.  <br />
<br />
Kendra watched, feeling her mouth go dry.  April glanced over at her.  They stared at each other for a moment in silence, Kendra drifting through the water, slick hair over her eyes, and April standing at the side of the pool, gazing down at her.  April bit her lip for a moment, and then smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; April said, sticking a hand out to Kendra.  Together, they managed to pull her onto the deck.  &quot;You were a bit more...excited,&quot; she said mischievously, &quot;so it might take a few more minutes for you.  But I can drive you to your parents, and then back here.  You know...if you want me to, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Kendra said quickly.  &quot;I mean.  Yeah.  Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Lisa said.  &quot;I'll get some stuff together for tonight! How's pizza?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm!&quot; April said.  She reached a hand to Lisa, but she shook her head.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll swim around a little more.  Probably best if I'm fully clothed before we're all lying on a deck together.&quot;<br />
<br />
April rolled her eyes and walked into the house.  &quot;I'll get something for you too Kendra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra laid back and waited for the transformation to reverse itself.  &quot;Thanks for helping me out so much today,&quot; she told Lisa.  &quot;I didn't get a chance to...but if you hadn't come along, I don't know what would've happened.  Imagine if the school had found out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Lisa responded from the pool.  &quot;The life of a mer is an interesting one to say the least.  And I would know!  I'll have to tell you a few stories sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra snorted.  Her tail twitched and transformed back into legs, and she stood up shakily.  &quot;Whew!&quot; she said.  &quot;That's the longest I've been transformed in awhile!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; Lisa said.  &quot;Talk to April sometime.  She was once stuck as a mermaid for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A week!&quot; Kendra responded.   &quot;When did that happen?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;During school!  Remember that week she was in the wheelchair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought that was because of a surgery or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!  April's a master.  She's managed to keep it hidden since she was sixteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixteen!&quot; Kendra almost shouted.  &quot;She's been a mermaid since then?  I mean, you had sex then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lisa said.  She hesitated.  &quot;It's kind of my fault.  We started getting intimate around then...because I hadn't transformed yet.  I thought it was safe.  I thought that maybe if I had sex before I was transformed, it wouldn't happen to April.  But...I was wrong.  Even though I hadn't developed my tail yet, having sex with April caused her to transform.  Ironically, I didn't transform until a few weeks later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  It can get tricky.  Parents have to be careful with their kids when they're a mer.  Sex can have some consequences.  That's how it happens to a lot of people, actually.  And sometimes, it's not right away.  April transformed because she was of age and we had a lot of it in a small time frame.  But other girls I've known, and other guys, they had sex with a mer, and they didn't transform for months or years, because it's random, and it depends on your age.  I knew one guy who transformed just before his eighteenth birthday...and it was because he had sex with a mermaid who hadn't transformed at age sixteen.  It took a long ass time for him to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's scary!&quot; Kendra said.  &quot;It's like a STD almost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STM,&quot; Lisa corrected her.  &quot;Sexually Transmitted Mermaid.  Me and April came up with it.&quot;  She laughed, and then looked at Kendra.  &quot;Sorry if I'm speaking a little too candidly.  I'm used to talking with April about all of this, and she's not bashful about any of this.&quot;  Lisa grinned.  &quot;Be honest with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know.  We're not together, not in a girlfriend-girlfriend kinda way.  Talk to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra's face burned.  &quot;I don't know what...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just sayin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra didn't say anything.  <br />
<br />
April came out with some clothes, already dressed herself.  Kendra got dressed.  &quot;Well, I'm parked out front.  We'll be back Lisa!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kay,&quot; Lisa called.  &quot;Bring a movie!  I'll order some pizza.  It'll be fun!  And I can show you some tricks for swimming later on tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
April and Kendra walked out to the front.  April drove a blue Ford.  Kendra got in and buckled herself up, feeling weird.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you live?&quot; April asked.  <br />
<br />
Kendra gave her the address.  April pulled out of the driveway and off they went.  Kendra looked out the window, realizing that she was alone with April.  They'd known each other for awhile, but only casually.  They didn't really talk much.  Just mostly through Lisa.  It was a bit odd.  She wasn't used to anyone knowing about her.  <br />
<br />
And Lisa had told her to talk to her.  So Lisa could tell.  Of course.  Lisa had had an entire lifetime of experience.  She had already gone through adolescence...albeit as a different gender, and awhile ago, but nevertheless, Lisa was experienced.  She could tell about these sorts of things better than Kendra could.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; they both said at the same time, and then laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You first,&quot; April said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you known about me?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A week and a half or so.  Lisa and I were gonna approach you about it, but then circumstances kinda forced Lisa to get involved before we were ready.  I know Lisa wanted to talk to you as soon as she found out, because she was excited...and relieved.  We're best friends, of course, but she's always felt a little guilty about having transformed me unintentionally.  Not that I mind.  Being a mermaid is fucking fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What gave me away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Signs that only another mermaid would recognize,&quot; April said with a smirk.  &quot;I saw you going off a lot.  And that you loved swimming when you were young, but you started avoiding the public pool.  I was watching you, and figured it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I was afraid,&quot; April went on.  &quot;Afraid of approaching you, and I asked Lisa not to do it until I could....until I....I told her...&quot;  She took a deep breath.  &quot;Lisa likes a lot of people.  And I love that about her.  She's such a fascinating person.  One of the best friends I've ever had.  Her situation doesn't bug me in the slightest - it even makes her a little more attractive.  But because of her siren roots, she ends up with a lot of women.  And she's been with just as many men before too.  And mermaids and mermen.  It just happens with sirens.  We're not official.&quot;  She glanced down for a moment.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Kendra said in a low voice, watching her cautiously.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; April said.  &quot;I've already accepted that.  I'm fine with it.  But with you...well, I'm just a girl that was transformed.  You were apparently born into it.  I don't know.  i didn't want to get my hopes up.&quot;  They pulled up to a stoplight.  &quot;And there's...I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra's mouth suddenly became dry.  She opened it to say something, but nothing came out.  She looked away quickly, hiding her face, and then back at April.  April was biting her lip, looking anxious.  April opened her mouth, but Kendra suddenly decided to take the initiative and leaned forward, kissing April before she could say anything.  She let out a surprised gasp, and then leaned into the kiss.  Kendra lifted a hand, massaging the back of April's back, and she started to do the same...but then, they both felt a familiar sensation, and April moaned.  Then she leaned back, shuddering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that!&quot; she said breathlessly, and then laughed.  &quot;For now, anyway!  Do you want me to transform while driving?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kendra breathed, feeling herself tingle.  But since she had already been transformed for so long, she was able to control it.  Mostly.  She did feel her breasts grow a little, which was a weird sensation.  That would take some getting used to.  April's breasts grew as well.  They looked at each other and laughed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; April said.  &quot;That makes things more interesting.  I've liked you for awhile, and I never knew....&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;But I'm glad I know now.&quot;  She looked at Kendra and grinned suddenly.  &quot;Continue that later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; Kendra said, feeling elated.  Another mermaid, and one that liked her.  Life was going to be a lot more interesting from now on, now that she knew other mermaids.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have to be careful, of course.  There's other ways to be intimate without being permanently transformed.&quot;  April grinned.  &quot;I'll have to show them to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to that,&quot; Kendra said.  <br />
<br />
They drove on in silence, stealing glances.  Kendra's mind wandered as they got closer to her parents out.  She was anxious about coming out to them, and wondering how they would react to her having known for so long without telling them.  She tried to think of something else to keep herself calm; the last thing she needed was to find out that anxiety triggered it as well.  She thought of the city that Lisa had mentioned.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What's the city like?&quot; Kendra asked.  &quot;Have you been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; April said.  &quot;I wanted to check it out a few times.  But you'll have to see for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww...&quot; Kendra said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.  It's impressive.  I don't want to ruin it for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmph.  Some girlfriend you're going to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We mermaids are a secretive folk,&quot; April laughed.<br />
<br />
They pulled up to her house.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll wait here,&quot; April said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kendra said.  &quot;Go ahead and come in.  I shouldn't be too long.  I just want to know...and then I can talk to them later.  I'm a little angry that they never said anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; April said.<br />
<br />
They got out of the car and went into the house.  Kendra's parents were home.  Her dad was in the kitchen, helping her mom cook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, good!&quot; her mom said.  &quot;You're home!  And hi, April, it's nice to see you again!  I haven't seen you since Lisa's birthday!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; April said pleasantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...dad...&quot; Kendra said.  &quot;I have something I want to tell you.  And I want to know something as well.&quot;  She took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it honey?&quot; her mom asked, looking a little concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can always be honest with us,&quot; her dad added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;  Kendra paused.  &quot;I know about me,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Her mom smiled uncertainly.  &quot;Pardon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what I am.  I found out.  I've known for weeks now, trying to keep it a secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mom's smile waned.  &quot;Keep it a secret?&quot; she asked, clearly confused.  Her dad didn't seem to understand any more.  Kendra glanced at April, who was frowning.  She squeezed Kendra's hand in support.  &quot;I don't...&quot;  Then she glanced at April, and then back at Kendra.  Then at their hands.  Her eyes grew wide.  &quot;Oh!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Kendra said, letting go of April's hand.  Then she sighed, and grabbed April's hand.  &quot;Well.  Okay.  Yeah.  But not THAT!&quot; she said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; her mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need a minute too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a MERMAID!  And why have you KEPT that from me!&quot; Kendra shouted.  &quot;Which one of you is it!  Or is it both of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
They stared back at her blankly.  <br />
<br />
Then her dad laughed.  &quot;Very funny.  Look, Kendra, sweetie...we won't judge you.  You don't have to make this into some kind of thing to make it okay to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then it's not you,&quot; Kendra said angrily.  &quot;So why did you keep it from me, mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the WORLD are you talking about?&quot; Kendra's mom asked.<br />
<br />
Kendra growled.  &quot;I know all about it, okay?  Stop pretending!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm....Kendra...I don't think...&quot; April said in a low voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look!  I'll show you that I know!&quot;  She let go of April's hands and marched into the kitchen.  Her parents watched her in shock.  She grabbed the faucet and turned it on, and then splashed water all over her legs and body.  She willed the transformation to occur, and felt the tingle spread through her body, and the itch grow more intense.  Then her borrowed pants ripped apart, and she fell back against the counter with a grunt of paint, and felt her legs slam together and merge, and her feet elongate.  It was the third time that day that she had transformed.  She wondered if there were any side effects of transforming too much in one day.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
She looked up at her parents.<br />
<br />
Her mother's eyes were as a wide as saucers, looking at the tail.  &quot;That's...that's...&quot; she said in a high pitched voice.  Then she screamed, her eyes rolled back, and she fainted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Kendra cried, unable to get over to her easily.<br />
<br />
Her dad was staring at her with wide eyes as well.  He backed up, blinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;This..this has gotta be a dream,&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad.  It's not a dream.  I don't understand.  How do neither of you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm calling 911!&quot; he said.  &quot;We need to get you medical attention!  Oh my God!&quot;  He picked up the phone.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Neither of them know!&quot; Kendra said.  She looked over at April, panicking.  &quot;Oh shit!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
April looked panicked as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?  I need an ambulance!  My daughter is having some kind of...I don't know what it is!  Just get the hell over here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to get you out of here!&quot; April shouted.  She ran over to Kendra and started dragging her out of the room.  &quot;We'll get you back to Lisa's and hide out there,&quot; she muttered.  &quot;Until they calm down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look out!&quot; Kendra warned, pointing.  Her father had come back into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that!&quot; her father shouted.  &quot;Get away from her!&quot;  He ran over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get me out of here!&quot; Kendra screamed.</p>
