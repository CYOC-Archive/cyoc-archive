<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leslie wasn&#39;t asleep long before pain woke her up.  Her whole body hurt now, from her head down to her feet.  She tried to stand, but her back felt sore, and her legs didn&#39;t seem to want to bend the right way.  So she crawled out of the cave into the moonlight.  In the pale light of the moon, she was shocked by what she saw.  <br />
<br />
She no longer resembled a horse, at all. Her body was long, and lean and covered in thick hard scales.  Her feet were still long, but were now very wide at the tip, ending in  four large toes tipped by sharp claws.  A fifth claw was midway on her foot, like the dewclaw of a dog.  Her thighs were still thick and packed with muscles, but were hunched in a way that made it impossible to stand erect.  Her tail was much longer, snaking behind her as she crawled. At its base it was as thick as her thigh.  Long thin sharp spikes ran along her tail and up her back.  Her arms were still thick and packed with muscle, but the muscle seemed less defined as it was covered by thick scales.  Like her feet, her hands were now very long and wide at the tip, ending in four sharp claws.  Her fingers were thick and stubby, connected with webbing. She realized with horror, that she would never be able to grip anything again. <br />
<br />
The pain that woke her redoubled, and she looked down at her abdomen to locate its source.  She realized with a shock that she now had a very long neck, and could easily move her head  past her chest and down to her belly. As she passed her chest she noted that her small breasts were gone completely, receded into her flat wide scaled chest.  Her belly ached again, and she watched as it expanded rabidly, ballooning out into a beer gut.<br />
<br />
This is wrong, she thought.  This isn&#39;t what I wanted.  I wanted to be strong like a dragon, not look like one.  She had thought that the program would make her into an anthro-morphic dragon, like it had previously turned her into an anthro-morphic horse.  She didn&#39;t understand why it was turning her body completely into a dragon.<br />
<br />
Her groin now started to hurt, and she realized that her internal reproductive organs must be rearranging into a reptilian form.<br />
<br />
Will I lay eggs now? she thought with horror.  She began to crawl back towards the cave,  hoping to get help from Jeff. Suddenly, she felt a surge of hormones release from her new ovaries.  Her body responded with a massive surge of growth, causing her to stretch even longer and larger.  The hormones dulled her mind, and it was getting harder to keep her thoughts straight.  She thought briefly back to the warnings she had ignored. Could this be what they were warning her about?<br />
<br />
She felt another surge of hormones flow through her body, and her body continued to grow in kind.  She was worried, but the growth felt good, and her body felt even better after the growth had completed.  Her head now ached, and she crawled over to a small pond near the cave to see what was happening to her face.  <br />
<br />
She watched as her thick snout stretched even further, adding new teeth as it grew.  Her teeth became sharper and longer, and she ran her long slender tongue across them. <br />
<br />
This ....... this feels wrong ......she thought. But it doesn&#39;t hurt ..... it actually feels really good. Maybe its not so bad......<br />
<br />
Her head ached, and she shook it slightly, as two large horns grew from her skull, completing the transformation.  She looked down at her new face, no longer feeling any confusion. She turned her head, looking at it from every angle in the water.<br />
<br />
I look ..... good, she thought.  I don&#39;t know what I was worried about before.  I feel great and I look even better.  This is how I was always meant to be.  A powerful dragon.  I have no need to fear anymore, no need to cower to some fool like Brittany for protection.  No need to fear angry little anthro-horses.<br />
<br />
She looked back to the cave where Jeff - her prize, her treasure - was sleeping.  Their time together had been short, but she felt a strong bond with him.  His love had touched her deeply, and she desired more of his love with an insatiable yearning. She now coveted him, and no longer wanted him to leave her and return to his sister.  He had said he liked her last night, so she saw no need for him to go.<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t wait until he wakes up and she&#39;s the new beautiful me, she thought.  He won&#39;t be able to resist me.</p>
