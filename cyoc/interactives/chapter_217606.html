<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How is this possible?”  Jeff and Scott stood in the locker room, fully restored to their true selves, wearing their own clothing.  Jeff didn’t mind so much being his smaller, 16-year-old self again after being stuck as an obese sow for what seemed like eternity.<br />
<br />
Behind them, a giant six foot penis and huge balls spasmed and orgasmed, a giant cum fountain shooting from its giant mushroom head, at the ceiling and toward the showers.  Veins stuck out around the hot, hard, throbbing shaft.<br />
<br />
TansDem Labs’ agents milled around the locker room of the football team turned oddities, anthros, and all manner of freaks,  cleaning up the mess caused by a rogue Chronivac.  One agent passed a couple of giant breasts sitting only a few feet away from the giant penis, and couldn’t resist tweaking a nipple; he was rewarded with a spurt of fresh milk.  A second agent saw the first, “Seriously, Dallas?  We’re supposed to revert them back to normal, not milk them.”  A twunky cat-boi  anthro ran over on all fours, licking the milk from the floor, tail out behind it.<br />
<br />
“The truth is, people assume the Chronivac  technology is highly sophisticated and advanced,” Agent Willis explained to Jeff and Scott.   “We have people speculating all the time that it’s some kind of gene-re-sequencer slash matter re-alignment technology or some sort of device working on the principles of advanced quantum physics.  You know, Star Trek stuff.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff got it.  He rubbed a tender nipple – one of the jocks had gone to town on it while he was a huge tittied sow.  His head still felt a little foggy from the experience.  “So you’re saying it’s not advanced technology?”  Jeff noticed the giant veined penis and balls slowly stop cumming, a TransDem agent approaching to help the former-jock.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing so complicated,” Willis affirmed.  “In fact, it’s quite simple.”<br />
<br />
“Oh I’ve gotta hear this,” Scott said, skeptical.  He couldn’t take his eyes away as he a couple of sopping wet donk-bois self sucking their giant cocks as they were obliviously led away by TransDem agents.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Willis said politely.  “Trade secret.  If we told you how it worked, you’d realize that all the software and hardware we sell are merely placebos, and you’d be able to do it yourselves without buying our products.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, right,” Scott wasn’t buying it.  “I can turn myself into a dog and Jeff can turn himself into a pig with a bunch of huge teats.  And Billy and Kelly over there turned themselves  into self-sucking donkeyboys with giant dicks.”<br />
<br />
“Yes and no.”  Willis thought for a moment, then offered, “So much of the living we do is in our heads.  So much of what we experiences is through our own filters of beliefs – our perceptions.  I don’t mean scientific or religious beliefs – I mean what we actually deep-down believe about ourselves, our world, and our place in it.  Stuff we believe that sometimes we’re not even consciously aware of.”<br />
<br />
“I always believed Danvers was a big dick,” Jeff commented with a laugh, watching the giant cock and balls dribbling the last of its cum and starting to droop over a little.  A TransDem agent took his Chronivac and used it on the giant dick and balls.  Slowly, the mushroom head started to revert back into a jock’s head, the shaft started growing muscular arms.  The balls started lengthening and expanding into legs and feet.<br />
<br />
Something was bugging Scott.  “But before you got here, someone had manipulated Jeff into transforming me permanently into a bitch,” He nodded toward the shorter, much thinner Jeff,  “then someone manipulated Gomez to turn Jeff permanently into some kind of blubber-tit-sow.  And there were all those other transformations.  You’re telling me we can do that with the power of our minds?”<br />
<br />
Willis smiled, weighing his words carefully, seemingly oblivious to the naked, very sexy she-males stroking one another’s big cocks to his left; no doubt he had seen all kinds of things as a TransDem agent.  “Once people believed the world was flat.  Then over time they accepted that it was round.  It’s not that reality changed; people’s perception of reality changed.”<br />
<br />
“So you’re saying the Chronivac just alters our perceptions?” Jeff asked.  He was trying to ignore the she-males, confused whether he was turned on or grossed out now that he was back to his normal, heterosexual self.  One of them got down on his – her? – knees and and started sucking the other one.<br />
<br />
“Yes… and no,” Willis took a report from one of his associates, looked down the list, then turned his attention back to the boys.  “It operates on a person’s beliefs, desires, and imagination, combined with other factors I won’t go into here.  It’s been said by some of its developers we’ve just taught people to lie better to themselves – but I never liked that take on it.  I prefer to think of it as opening up new ways of looking at things.  New fantasies, new possibilities.”  Willis thought for a moment, then, “I know this is frustrating for you, but believe me when I tell you it’s for your own protection.”<br />
<br />
Scott laughed.  “I thought it was ‘trade secrets’.”  He saw a TransDem agent lead a seven foot tall musclebound Minotaur and satyr away by their chain leads.  The Satyr was bleating and jacking itself off, leaving a trail of cum everywhere it went.<br />
<br />
“Well yes, there is certainly the trade secret angle we have to consider, too.”  Willis furrowed his brows.  “Imagine if someone from the tenth century arrived in today’s world.  Imagine how overwhelmed they would be by all the new technology around them – it would seem like nothing short of magic and miracles.”<br />
<br />
Jeff and Scott looked at all the freaky transformed jocks around them.  An old man and a toddler walked hand in hand one direction.  In the other, a giant musclebound Pokémon had a half-devoured jock made of chocolate in its arms that an agent was working on getting away from it.  Suddenly  it didn’t seem so hard to imagine what Willis was talking about.<br />
<br />
Willis continued, “Now imagine how devastating it could be for them to realize everyone they knew had been dead for hundreds of years.”<br />
<br />
“That would suck,” Scott said absently, watching the agent using a device to get the consumed chocolate from the creature’s stomach so he could reconstitute the half-eaten jock into a whole.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry about him – Siddig has lots of experience reverting chocolate – your friend will be just fine.”  Willis turned back to face the boys.  “Now go a step further, and imagine those people from ancient days… all the hundreds and thousands of personal beliefs about themselves and the world they live in being challenged constantly by the truths that we’ve revealed in our advances in science.  One simple one being that the world is round and not flat.  But not just that one, nearly everything they held dear and believed being radically and demonstratively challenged and proven as quite different from what they believed, beyond a doubt.”<br />
<br />
“Shit – we got a T-rex loose on the field!”  Several TransDem agents ran past at full speed, headed outside.</p>
