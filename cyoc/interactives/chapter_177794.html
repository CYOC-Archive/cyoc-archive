<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was already lunch by the time Jen made it to school. Her nose had bleed way more than she had been expecting it to, and her eyes couldn&#39;t stop watering for several minutes after the procedure. However she was happy. The golden ring was just how she wanted it. The size fit so that the bottom of the ring hung just above her upper lip so that it wouldn&#39;t be in the way when she was eating or anything. However she could feel it whenever she spoke, which was what she was hoping somewhat for as well.<br />
<br />
When she sat down at the table with her friends, hardly anyone commented on the newest addition to her face, which made Jen feel a bit disappointed. &quot;Hey Susan, check out my new piercing&quot; said Jen to her best friend, hoping to finally get any kind of reaction out of her. <br />
<br />
Susan looked up from her tray and finally noticed the ring. &quot;Woah, you got a nose ring? I didn&#39;t even notice that somehow. It oddly suits you almost too well though. Like, to me it feels as if it is only natural for you to have it. And if you hadn&#39;t pointed it out just now, then I likely would not have even noticed honestly. Still though, it looks good. Did it hurt?&quot; Answered Susan awkwardly, trying to figure out why she felt the way she did currently about something that should be seen as so out of the ordinary that it should just draw in a ton of attention naturally. But the more she thought upon this, the less she began to remember as to why she was even thinking this in the first place, until she had forgotten entirely what she was even thinking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was quite a bit more than what I had been expecting. But I am still glad that I got it&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got what?&quot; Asked Susan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, my nose ring? Haven&#39;t you been listening to me?&quot; Asked Jen, confused by Susan&#39;s question. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, well I mean, it does look a lot shinnier than your usual plastic one. Is this one brass or real gold?&quot; Asked Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its made of a titanium-gold alloy I guess. But I guess it is made in a special way so that it stays golden in color even if it wears down in an area. Its kind of neat. It fits much more comfortably than that cheep plastic clip on I had before. No more pinched septums for me at least.&quot; Jen was not sure why she now somehow remembered the things that she just said, but went with it because it was getting to hard to question them. These new memories were obviously just created unexplainably, and Jen knew this, but she also couldn&#39;t refute their existance and just felt that she had to go along with them for the time being at least for some reason. So she didn&#39;t sit on them for too much longer and just continued with the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I always wondered. Why did you ever want to get the ring in the first place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise you won&#39;t laugh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I got it because my favorite animals have always been cows and bulls. I use to have a cow stuffed animal that had a nose ring, and I wanted one to match it ever since then. Plus, now I also find them a bit kinky. Huh... does that mean that I&#39;m maybe, just a little bit into bondage?&quot; Continues Jen, now wondering if she had a slight fetish for BDSM play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends on if you want to be tied up by it or not&quot; points out Susan and then with a laugh, she added &quot;but my guess would be that it does in your case you dirty cowslut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I am not a cowslut! I prefer the term cow enthusiast.&quot; scoffed Jen while laughing too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the girl who has yet to buy a bikini that isn&#39;t a cow print bottom and a pink/fleshy colored top so that it looks like your tits are instead udders&quot; points out Susan, causing Jen to studder for a bit as she couldn&#39;t refute it. That was exactly the very reason why she did it. And she knew that Susan, being her best and longest friend, would have easily figure that out by now. &quot;Well... I-I mean... Yeah, and? I look cute in cow print and pink. That is the only reason.&quot; Quickly lied Jen. <br />
<br />
They both knew it was a big fat lie and that Susan&#39;s answer was the right one anyways. But this was just how they joked around with each other. &quot;I bet if I stripped you of your skirt and uniform, you would have cow some print underwear on&quot; bet Susan.<br />
<br />
&#39;Crap, which underwear do I have on now. Shit, I think it is actually my cow print ones now that I think of it...&#39; thought Jen to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that is a loud silence!&quot; Susan, who was currently sitting across from Jen, slipped her right foot out of her sandal and lifted up Jen&#39;s skirt with her toes, confirming her suspicion. &quot;Ha! I knew it. White with black splotches.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen quickly pushed Susan&#39;s foot down. &quot;Ok, so I am wearing them. No need to give the entire world a show!!&quot; whined Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, maybe that was a bit too much. Sorry &#39;bout that. You are just so adorable with your reactions sometimes that you just make me want to tease you.&quot; Admitted Susan.<br />
<br />
Jen pouted playfully, really trying to emphasize her &quot;adorableness&quot;. &quot;What are you, my boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan didn&#39;t miss a beat &quot;would you prefer if if I was your farm hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, SHUT UP!&quot; <br />
<br />
They both started laughing. After school, Jen returned home to find a box next to her mirror with about 3 different color nose rings, one of which was a plastic clip on that she immediately tossed into the trash. She really did hate that annoying thing and was glad that she finally now had the real deal.</p>
