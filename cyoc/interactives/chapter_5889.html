<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake stared again at himself in the mirror. A lot of staring at himself recently, but this time he wanted to splash water over his face, but didnt want to ruin his make up. Thsi was dumb. He needed to go home and sort out the lamp, get back into bein drake, the male one!<br />
<br />
He removed his jacket, his dress had started to ride up and hi bra was tight again. Fixing and shuffling his dress down, he still looked stunning. <br />
<br />
He gathered his things, and walked down stairs.<br />
<br />
The clip clop of his heels banged against the stairs, and ethan was at the bottom trying his hardst to look up his dress, holding a cup of tea in one hand.<br />
<br />
He pulled his dress down and stood at the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;i think i should leave, i think i made a mistake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? i dont even know who you are? at least stay for the drink?&quot; Ethan looked crest fallen. And drake felt like he owed him this. He had after all walked in wearing the skin of the girl of his dreams, and his new female emotions felt sorry for the guy who was ill and wanting.<br />
<br />
&quot;ok ok... i will stay for the drink... but i err... i... i am going for a drink tonight, with a few friends, thats why i am dresed up.&quot;  drake was now thinking qicker on his feet, and suddenly grew in confidence. He was in charge here, and ten more minutes wouldnt kill him.<br />
<br />
Ethan smiled again, and passed &quot;dru&quot; her drink, she looked very uncomfy, not here, in his house she seemed very at ease, but she seemed ncomfortabel in her own skin, and he could tell she was having trouble with her shoes. But he couldnt take his eyes off her, she had the most amazing body, and her eyes seemed to have something hidden. She turned and walked to the living room, her ass was perfect, and he wanted to touch.<br />
<br />
They both walked into the living room and sat down, drake once again sat at an angle to avoid revealing his breasts, and ethan sat next to her.<br />
<br />
Drake could feel ethan's gaze, and was regretting staying. He crossed his legs and drank quickly. Ethan took his cup and placed it on the coffee table. He looked at drake in the eyes, and drake felt ethan's hand touch his leg. This was strange... too strange, and he moved his hand off his leg. Ethan wasnt put off though, and he pushed drake down and onto the sofa lieing down, Beofre he new it, ethan was on top of him.<br />
<br />
Drake was confused. He felt ethans penis erect and large touchng his vagina through his dress, and his large hands touched his erect breats.Ethan kissed Drake, and that was enough. He felt himself give in and his groin was moist. He wanted to be held, and befor ehe new it he was searching for ethans penis with his hand. His smaller hand drew his flies down and he pushed ethan from him and sat him down. he pulled his manhood from his pants, and began stroking. This was so strange, but it was why he had come here, and he felt his female side engrossed in this new experience. He stroked ethans penis up and down, and ethan began to moan.<br />
<br />
Ethan couldnt believe it, he had this amazing woman feeling his dick, and he was sat here not knowing who She was. He moved his hand over her huge breats and slowly followed down to her vagina, he put his hand up her dress and began to stroke her vagina, he couldnt keep it up for long tho, his own feeligns got the better of him and she pmped harder and harder. He came. Ane let out a loud sigh.<br />
<br />
Drake had semen all over his polished nails, and he looked at ethan. He couldnt believe what he had just done. He had just masturbated his best friend, and now had his semen all over him. He stood up. His groin moist from the vaginal juices, his breats tender from the ecitement. He wiped his hand on ethan and squeeled. Squeeld like the woman he had become, and grabbed his jacket purse and left. His heels banging as he ran, and ethan sat confused but happy.<br />
<br />
Drake ran, removed his heels after a whle and ran all the way to his own home.</p>
