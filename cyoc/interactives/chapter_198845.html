<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">      Max had to go to the dentist, he didn&#39;t mind he actually liked it and it was definitely going to be more fun as an anthro dog with his new mouth and tongue. Jeff felt raw and rough, Max had brushed his teeth and tounge thoroughly getting himself ready. Jeff heard muffled voices&quot; yes mom I brushed my teeth see&quot; Jeff felt himself slide out of Max&#39;s mouth as the furry boy opened his mouth showing his mom&quot; I see, don&#39;t drool in the car please&quot; &quot; sorry mom&quot;.<br />
      They got to the dentist and checked in, the waiting room was filled with a mixture of furries and humans a cute stallion caught Max&#39;s eye and he gave the boy a small wave before sitting down next to mom. As Max waited a human boy glanced at him made eye contact and quickly looked away. Max caught the boy staring again a few times before he was called back.<br />
     Jeff waited in darkness with only Max&#39;s breathing  giving any sense of the environment. He felt Max moving around and thought he heard someone talking. He could tell max was laying back when the saliva is ln his mouth pooled in the back of his mouth. Bright light flooded Max&#39;s mouth as he opened wide for the dental hygienist, Jeff could see a cute feline face covered by a mask. &quot; Nice and wide that&#39;s it, ohh we have some drool let&#39;s get some suction&quot; she placed a suction tool on Max&#39;s mouth the tip resting on Jeff , it hurt slightly but helped with the mess. &quot;Somebody&#39;s been a good boy I see brushing every day? Flossing daily&quot; Max nodded as the dental hygienist got to Jeff felt the hygienist brush against him and the rush Max felt from the contact. It took minimal work with the scraper and after a quick polish which left Jeff feeling like he was coated in a bitter gritty paste the dentist himself came in for a examination. A young blonde haired human examined Max&#39;s mouth and teeth&quot; I see nothing wrong, looks great&quot; he removed the suction and drool quickly filled Max&#39;s mouth&quot; ahh k9&#39;s clean mouths just a bit messy&quot; Max closed his mouth and sat up&quot; it&#39;s messy sometimes especially when I get hot and pant&quot; he collected the care kit including a new K9 toothbrush longer than a human one&quot; ok sport let&#39;s get your mom in here so you can get home.<br />
      Max walked back to the waiting room stopping at the water fountain to rinse his mouth out, as he lapped at the flow his mom walked by petting him on the head and telling him to wait for her. Max went to the waiting room and sat down next to the boy from earlier.&quot; Hi I&#39;m Max mind if I sit here, I&#39;m waiting for my mom&quot; the boy nodded&quot; yeah it&#39;s ok my name is Darren&quot; he held out his hand and shook Max&#39;s paw like hand.&quot; Nice to meet you Darren&quot;. Max sat down adjusting his tail so it fit in the gap in the seat.&quot; I&#39;m waiting for my mom and little brother. So boring, my phone died because I forgot my charger&quot; How many siblings do you have?&quot; &quot; Just my brother, how about you?&quot; The boys talked about their families and friends and were surprised to discover that they lived only a few blocks apart.&quot; You should definitely come over sometime&quot; Max told him we can play video games together ``&#39;&#39; yeah that sounds great&quot; Darren&#39;s mom and little brother came out and Darren got ready to go quickly giving Max his phone number&quot; see you soon&quot;.<br />
      Max had to wait a little longer for his mom to come out and stood up eagerly when she did. They got back in the car and drove home&quot; I made a new friend today, his name&#39;s Darren he actually lives nearby&quot; &quot; that&#39;s great honey&quot; his mom seemed distracted&quot; what&#39;s wrong mom?&quot; She looked at him&quot; I just don&#39;t like the dentist makes my mouth all gritty and gross&quot; &quot; yeah I don&#39;t like how that feels either I drank lots of water after to rinse out&quot;. &quot; That&#39;s a good idea for next time&quot;. They got home and Max raced inside running into the bathroom unzipping his pants quickly, his penis emerged from his sheath and drooped limply allowing him to pee with a sigh of relief.<br />
      The next day Max decided to call Darren and invite him over. Darren was eager to get out of the house and away from his brother it only took a few minutes for the boy to ride his bike over. Darren arrived sweaty and breathing heavily from the bike ride over. &quot; Hi Max!!&quot; He called out smiling happily sweat dripped from his face&quot; hi, man you got here fast want some water&quot; &quot; yes please water sounds great&quot;. The boys walked to the kitchen and Max filled two cups of water giving one to Darren. Darren drank the water while Max lapped his in a combination between human and K9 methods. &quot; Thanks I was really thirsty after that bike ride&quot; . The boys put their cups on the counter and went to Max&#39;s room.<br />
       &quot;So what do you wanna play? I have the new Racing game? I don&#39;t really like shooting games I&#39;m not good at them&quot; They settled on a demolition game and spent several hours attempting to destroy each others vehicles. Max was soon panting lightly from the excitement his tongue hanging out slightly dripping thin ropes of onto his shirt. Darren glanced at him&quot; umm you ok Max?&quot; &quot; Umm what, oh yeah I&#39;m ok, I pant it helps me keep cool we don&#39;t sweat like you do.&quot; &quot; Really?? I didn&#39;t know that, what else is different about you&quot; his face reddened and he stammered a apologie&quot; sorry I didn&#39;t mean to ask like that&quot;. &quot; It&#39;s ok I&#39;m kinda curious about what&#39;s different about humans, it&#39;s stupid we don&#39;t learn about it in school&quot; &quot; yeah it is like we learned about puberty and how boys and girls are different, like it&#39;s not obvious but they don&#39;t teach anything about Like how it happens both my parents and siblings are human and then you have me.<br />
         Max paused the game and looked at Darren&quot; first thing is obvious I have furr and a tail&quot; he wagged his tail slowly&quot; the less than obvious things are that I can smell and hear better than humans the downside is I can&#39;t really drink like you not with a snout, speaking of snouts can be messy as we, at least k9s like myself  tend to drool more, it&#39;s kinda embarrassing but nothing I can do about it. Darren nodded&quot; what about the less than obvious things? Max smiled evilly&quot; you mean like my penis?&quot; Darren blushed&quot; umm yeah, I&#39;ve seen a dogs before&quot; &quot; it&#39;s almost the same for us, well at least the boys, I have a sheath and everything it&#39;s just bigger than a dogs. &quot; That&#39;s so cool it must be really fun to pla&quot; he stopped mid world his hand covering his mouth.<br />
      Max&#39;s heart skipped a beat at the boys words, should he press forward and continue the subject? Was Darren gay? His mind raced with possibilities in the end he decided to play it safe&quot; Yeah it can be fun&quot; he said with a wry smile&quot; we&#39;re both boys everyone knows that boys play with themselves down there&quot;. Darren smiled&quot; that&#39;s true&quot;. &quot;So what&#39;s different about being a human?&quot;<br />
&quot; Well we don&#39;t have fur or tails or anything cool like that, I sweat which is gross because it makes me smell and feel dirty. The less obvious things that are different, I don&#39;t have a sheath my penis just hangs there I don&#39;t even have a foreskin my parents made that decision for me&quot;. Max excused himselfself &quot; I&#39;ll be back i really need to pee&quot; Darren looked for a moment like he wanted to say something but he let it pass&quot; hurry back I&#39;m about to beat you.<br />
Max came back from the bathroom and the boys continued their gaming.<br />
       A few hours later it was dinner time and Max asked if Darren could stay for dinner. Darren called his mom while Max asked his, it was a yes for both. After a dinner of pork chops and potatoes the boys went back to Max&#39;s room they had a few hours before Darren had to go. The boys picked up where they left off with Darren beating Max. Max was soon panting again his tongue hanging out to the side&quot; so how long is that thing&quot; Max turned facing Darren&quot; what thing&quot; &quot; your tongue silly it&#39;s out further than earlier&quot; Max shrugged&quot; I&#39;ve never measured it actually never thought about it&quot; &quot; if I had a tongue like that I&#39;d definitely measure it&quot; Max got up and went to his desk grabbing a plastic ruler&quot; let&#39;s find out&quot;.<br />
He sat down and handed the ruler to Darren. Jeffs world was suddenly filled with light as Max opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue letting it flop limply between his front teeth slobbery ropes of saliva dripping into his shirt. &quot; Holy smokes it&#39;s huge&quot; he gently helped Jeff with his left hand while placing the ruler on the tongue&quot; 6½ inches damn, and slimy&quot; he rubbed Max&#39;s tongue between his fingers making Jeff twitch slightly&quot; it moved!!&quot; He quickly let go and Max closed his mouth almost completely letting Jeff hang out just a little bit. <br />
      Darren looked at his fingers covered in globs of drool&quot; wow&quot; he muttterd to himself&quot; you want a towel?&quot; &quot; No I&#39;m good&quot; and with a smile Darren licked his fingers clean. &quot; Did you really just do that&quot; Max asked? &quot; Yeah something wrong&quot; &quot; no it&#39;s just I never thought I&#39;d find another person who likes stuff like that&quot; &quot; another person?&quot; Darren looked at him. &quot; Yeah I have a friend, another dog, who loves stuff like that&quot;. A knock on the door made both boys jump&quot; Max, Darren it&#39;s getting dark&quot; Darren stood up&quot; well I guess I should be going we should definitely get together again maybe you can come over tomorrow?&quot; &quot; Yeah that sounds great&quot;. Both boys walked to the door and Darren got on his bike waving goodbye, Max returned the wave his tail wagging happily behind him.</p>
