<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve reached into his pants to see what he had down there. He was still hoping to have a dick, but was prepared for the worst. <br />
<br />
His hands felt nothing. No dick at all, the member that he’d always had down there was gone. It was super weird for him to feel his hands touching part of his crotch that never before existed, feeling that smooth skin that before held his junk. <br />
<br />
Steve reached down and felt the odd feeling of a slit down there. Reaching down further, he could very clearly feel a hole. It was such a strange sensation, feeling body parts he wasn’t used to. The indescribable feeling of touching a hole between his legs. <br />
<br />
He pulled down his pants and underwear to finally confirm. Yep, he had a pussy. He was going to be stuck for the next month with girl&#39;s parts. <br />
<br />
Steve had moved back home to his small town when he couldn’t make it in the expensive city. The lack of privacy was worth not having a rent to pay. Suddenly his little brother Thomas came into his room.<br />
<br />
“Woah! You’re a vagina guy?! I never knew,” said Thomas, looking in wonderment at Steve’s crotch.<br />
<br />
“Get outta here you little perv!” shouted Steve, pulling up his pants and underwear.<br />
<br />
“Come on Steve, I’ve never seen one,” said Thomas in a begging whine, moving closer to Steve’s bed instead of leaving, “All my bros have dicks by unhappy coincidence.”<br />
<br />
“Fine, you can look at it a little,” said Steve as his little brother was now right next to his bed. He shucked his pants and underwear. He hated to admit it, but it was kinky having someone to share this new change with.<br />
<br />
Thomas started to pull down his own pants and underwear, revealing his dick and balls to his brother. Seeing those made Steve&#39;s new anatomy squirt. “What are you doing Thomas?? I said you could look at me, I never said I needed to see all that,” said Steve, acting defensive.<br />
<br />
“Dude are you serious? I just saw your pussy squirt when you saw my junk,” laughed Thomas, whose dick just got to full mast. It was true. No matter how hard Steve wanted to fight it, thoughts were creeping into his mind about his little bro’s four inch erect cock invading his new cavity. It wasn’t that small from lack of maturity, it was simply his fully developed cock. It did have more girth than a lot of other cocks, to its credit. Here Steve was, with an appointment to lose his virginity to his girlfriend today, considering throwing all of that away to let Thomas hit it.<br />
<br />
Instead of retorting, Steve put a curious hand out and cupped Thomas’ balls. They were velvety soft despite all the pubes. Even though they felt much like his former balls, it was weird to hold someone elses, and even weirder that he no longer had his own. It felt weird but good, oddly sensual.<br />
<br />
Steve bounced Thomas’ balls up and down a little, making his little boner boing around as well. As he stared in sexual fascination, he didn’t notice Thomas’ hand creeping towards his new vagina. Thomas put a finger in and rubbed his big brother’s clit, eliciting a huge moan that escaped Steve’s mouth before he could stop himself. Steve covered his mouth a second too late, becoming entirely red faced as he made eye contact with Thomas. Thomas laughed playfully at Steve, but was seriously turned on by Steve’s embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Okay Steve, I guess I’ll be going now. Since you don’t want me here,” said Thomas, taking his finger out. By now Steve’s hand went to go and replace the finger that just came out with one of his own. His hips gyrated in desperation.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” moaned Steve.<br />
<br />
“Why?” Asked Thomas.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me,” said Steve.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me what?” Teased Thomas.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me please!” said Steve. He was getting more turned on by how much Thomas knew he needed him.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me please, who?” Asked Thomas.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me little bro. Put that fat cock in me and fill me with your spunk,” said Steve as he finger fucked himself.<br />
<br />
Thomas stripped off the rest of his clothes and jumped up onto the bed, climbing on top of his skinny older brother and making out with him. <br />
<br />
At first Steve moaned in protest, but Thomas’ tongue felt good. He surrendered and let his little brother do what he wanted, even kissing him back. Then he felt it, the head of Thomas’ cock started to push into him until he was balls deep. As expected, the dick didn’t feel very long, but the thickness itself was satisfying. Steve started to throw his hips towards Thomas’ hips, forcing the small thick penis in and out. Now it was his little brother’s turn to moan uncontrollably. Feeling Steve’s tight pussy had him in some intense pleasure. Steve grabbed Thomas by the buttcheeks as he pumped, getting a good feel of his hairy bubble butt.<br />
<br />
After an hour of sweaty pumping and making out, Thomas exclaimed, “Oh fuck Steve, I’m gonna cum!”<br />
<br />
Steve himself had orgasmed a couple of times but seeing Thomas in the throws of passion had him about to burst again. The two brothers exploded in orgasm, moaning so loud they might’ve been heard.<br />
<br />
Thomas pulled out, grinning in perversion as he watched his load leak from his brother’s hole. Steve was totally emasculated, and it felt good as fuck.</p>
