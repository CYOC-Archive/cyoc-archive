<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Davis looked over his reflection and winced.  He'd always said he wished he was hung like a horse but -well- this was ridiculous!  &quot;The doner must've been a Clydesdale,&quot; he ruefully said as he forced himself to relax and slow his breathing.<br />
<br />
As he did so, the massive organ dangling from between his legs relaxed as well, drooping out of it's sheath and dangling further, further down until swinging half way past his knees.  &quot;Good God...&quot; he muttered, using both hands to heft it upwards.  It retracted slightly at his touch and he found he could control how far he dangled if he thought about it.<br />
<br />
His hands brushed against his still-human balls, terribly tiny by comparrison, beneath his mammoth penis.  &quot;Ok,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;just read the book over; you can fix this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking a bit bow-legged from the extra weight that he only partially supported in his hands, he waddled over to the book and sat down -spread legged- to look into it.  He flopped his massive cock over his right thigh and winced as it hit the floor with a meaty *slap*.<br />
<br />
Davis gritted his teeth and read over the spell for any nuances he may have missed.  In the detailed notes in the margin, it was written that this was a beginning spell and -as such- had many limitations.  It wasn't as elegant as more advanced incantions and could be influenced by nearby words, phrases or conditions.<br />
<br />
He looked at his horse cock and grimaced.  &quot;Well, that answers that question,&quot; he noted.  Grimly, he felt glad he hadn't called the telemarketer a shit-head...  Going back to the book, he read over the passages again, noting that in the general magic theory recorded by Asgurauld, the same spell should not usually be cast multiple times in a short period lest there be unwanted side-effects.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, too many side-effects allready,&quot; he muttered to himself, being grateful it was a Saturday morning and he didn't have to go in to work.  Still, he'd wanted to go out tonight and have some fun ... he certainly couldn't do it with a horse's cock hanging from his waist...  There *had* to be a way to even things out...<br />
<br />
Flipping through the book, Davis came upon a section he'd only skimmed over, before.  Essentially a treatise on sleep spells, he'd not found it really interesting, however, on the eigth page of the section there was a ritual for &quot;Sonambulesent Restoration&quot; ... restoring physical health and well-being through sleep.<br />
<br />
Looking over the spell carefully, he nodded to himself.  It only required a moonstone and some garlic to work.  His old High School class ring had a moonstone in it and he also had a heavy, granite mortar and pestle that could be used to pulverize it.<br />
<br />
He thought about it carefully and looked at his huge, horse's shaft.  He had to do it.<br />
<br />
Getting up carefully -and holding his cock to keep it from swinging against his legs as he walked- Davis retrieved his ring from a box in his bedroom and then took it into the small kitchen of his apartment.  Following the instructions exactly, he dropped the cloudy gemstone into the pestle and began pounding at it as described in the book.<br />
<br />
It took him nearly a half hour but at the end of that time, he'd managed to grind the moonstone into a fairly fine powder.  Adding a clove of garlic to the mix, he soon ground the two ingredients into a greyish paste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he muttered, looking at it, &quot;that should do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
The spell said that it would -as he slept- revitalize his body, smooth his appearance, even out any unwanted changes and -overall- heal him to a fit, perfect shape.  He hoped that meant he'd have his old &quot;equipment&quot; back, when he woke up.<br />
<br />
Too tired to care that his cock slapped against his calves, he took the mortar and pestle into his bedroom and lay down on the bed.  He checked the clock and felt the weight of his long night upon him.  It was almost 9am; a good sleep would do him good, anyway...<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes, he began to chant the words from the book, concentrating on healing himself while he slept.  While doing so, he slowly smeared the mixture over his chest, abdomen and horselike appendages.  The movement was rythmic and soon he dropped off to sleep.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sunlight streamed through Davis' window as he slowly woke, Saturday afternoon.  Bleary-eyed, he groaned at the cotten-filled mess that was his consciousness, and tried to focus.  Memory came streaming back and he felt the book heavy on his waist.<br />
<br />
Gulping a bit nervously, he shook his head and lifted the book to see.<br />
<br />
The horse cock was still there.  Sort of.<br />
<br />
The spell had, indeed, evened him out and fixed the discrepancies as best as it could.  It had only been a starting spell and probably hadn't been designed to handle repairs on transformative magics.  Still, what he saw was the same, thick, dark sheath emerging from his groin.  However, it now only hung to his knees and the tip, just visible as it pressed forward with his motions, was domed like a human's penis.  Beneath, his testicles had swollen up to a horse-like size and -similarily- looked like a cross between human and equine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, great...&quot; he muttered, contemplating what to do next...</p>
