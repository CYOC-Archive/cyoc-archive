<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a few years, Nick’s twin chose to seal himself in Mr. Christopher and be himself, Nick sealed himself in your sexy older brother, the clone in Matt sealed himself and Adam sealed himself. And after a lot of dates being John and Adam, they chose to finally marry. However, they need a best man , they think. You in your own body went to your new fathers and got an idea. Ronnie’s dad and your bully’s dad can be their best man at the wedding. John and Adam asked you to deliver Wedding invitations but to make things interesting , they mixed some of their new essence to  make Them your new uncles and cousins. John’s invitation goes to Ronnie and his dad , and Adam’s go to your bully’s dad, older brother and himself. <br />
<br />
You nodded and went with Matt to deliver. Matt was going to Ronnie’s and you went to your bully’s. The letters came with John’s and Adam’s  new essences in sample bottles labeled as “Shampoo”. It’s enough for their families to get possessed and ready for the wedding.  <br />
<br />
When Matt went to Ronnie’s , Ronnie answered the door and told him they weirdly needed shampoo and he’ll let his dad know. When you went to your bully’s, his dad answered and thought you were friends and thanked you . You and Matt then went home. Adam and John were proud and glad they received it. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ronnie’s dad saw the invitation and shampoo . He grabbed it and told Ronnie that Matt seems like a great person. He smelled John’s essence . “I’ll go take a shower! You go after!” Ronnie’s dad said. Ronnie nodded. “We should thank them after we go clean our selves!” Ronnie’s dad mentioned. Ronnie then chuckles and said “good idea Dad! Now go clean yourself! I’ll get ready my clothes!” Ronnie’s dad put John’s essence in the shower and undressed himself. He then went into the tub . He used soap to clean his body first then later squirted half of the bottle onto his hand and lathered John’s essence all over his head.<br />
<br />
After Ronnie’s dad was done, when he rinsed John’s essence got wrapped around and absorbed all to his brain. Ronnie’s dads memories got altered to make him act like John’s Brother . Ronnie knocks and asked his dad if he was done. Ronnie’s dad’s eyes changed color and he puts a towel on. Ronnie didn’t notice the eyes when his dad smiles and said Ronnie could bathe . Ronnie’s dad went to dress in Formal clothing and changed Ronnie’s clothes for him. Ronnie’s dad told Him that he hug his clothes in the bathroom for him. Ronnie then thanked him. Ronnie then chose to soap his body first like his dad first then used all that’s left in his bottle to shampoo his hair. When it was time for him to rinse, John’s essence went into Ronnie’s ears and absorbed into his brain altering his memories making him John’s nephew.  His eyes changed color too and he began to dress . He got out and saw his Dad. <br />
<br />
Ronnie’s dad: before we see John and Adam , let’s seal ourselves.  <br />
<br />
They unzipped their zipper and did so. It made their bodies Muscular and hard like Titanium. <br />
<br />
For your bully’s family, his dad puts the bottle of Adam’s essence in their Tub . Weirdly when his older brother went to shower , there’s enough “shampoo” for himself. The older brother used the bottle because he only needs to wash his hair. He took off his shirt and fancy suit  and grabbed the shower head . Adam’s essence went all onto his hand and spreads all over the older brother’s head . The essence quickly went into his ear and absorbed into his brain altering his memories making him Adam’s nephew. The older brother’s eyes changed color just like what happened at Ronnie’s then he sealed himself later creating enough of the essence for his dad and the bully his younger brother.<br />
<br />
The older brother smirks and got an idea. He planned to change to a better and fancier suit but first he got naked and turned invisible and hid. The bully came into the bathroom naked and began but the top parts of his outfit. When the bully was to put on new undies and his pants, the older brother sneaked up behind him and inserted himself into the bully’s ass. He hugged the Bully then ejected the essence into him. The essence quickly went to the Bully’s brain and completely absorbed itself altering his memories making him Adam’s other nephew and your best friend and favorite cousin. The older brother lets go and pulled himself out of the bully then went to his room to dress making him visible. <br />
<br />
The Bully blinks making his eyes changed color and smirked sealing himself and finished dressing up putting on his shoes. He chose to go for the dad while waiting for his older brother. He found their dad asleep then spat enough essence into his hand. He went to the sleeping dad and held the essence under his nose. The essence quickly went into the dad’s brain. Once the brothers were done they went in the car waiting for their dad.<br />
<br />
The dad woke up with his eyes changing color smirking making him your favorite uncle and Adam’s brother. <br />
The dad: just gotta seal then put on my shoes . <br />
<br />
The dad unzipped then sealed himself going to his shoes before zipping up him pants . He then got his keys then went to the car.  The bully was excited to play or hang with you and his older brother. The dad was acting happy for John and Adam. They were also happy that Ronnie and his dad is coming too. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nick was playing with his twin using your older brother’s body and Mr. Christopher’s body. Mr. Christopher wasn’t sealed yet but surprisingly Ronnie’s Dad and The Bully’s dad are going to Ryan Reynolds and Tom Holland. To make them their husbands. Ronnie’s dad is the youngest so he went to Tom while The bully’s dad try to get Ryan . Since Ronnie is a fan of Tom , he told his dad where he is . <br />
<br />
The bully’s older brother told their dad where Ryan Reynolds is. They smirked and drove to their locations. Ronnie’s dad saw Tom’s dog and chose to transfer some of his essence into her so the dog can transfer it to Tom. The dog barks licking Ronnie’s dad then going to Tom. Ronnie’s dad laughs and went back to the car waiting for Tom. <br />
<br />
<br />
The dog chose to “play with Tom”. Tom was napping and the dog licks him face (mostly his ear) making the essence crawl into him and absorb all into Tom’s mind. Tom groans when his memories altered to be best friends with Adam and Ronnie’s other dad. His eyes changed color and he sealed himself. Tom told his dog he will be back soon and puts on his fancy clothes and shoes. He later went outside and smirked. He opened Ronnie’s dad’s car door then put on his seatbelt. Tom looks at Ronnie’s dad and made out kissing with tongue. <br />
<br />
Ronnie’s dad : here’s your ring , my love! <br />
He puts what used to be his late wife’s ring on Tom’s finger. Tom smiled and kisses Ronnie’s dad again.<br />
Tom: let’s go now babe!<br />
<br />
Ronnie’s dad did so and Ronnie was excited. Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds was single since his ex wife broke up with him . Turned out he was at a bar, The bully’s dad told the older brother to watch the bully. Once he got in, he saw Ryan drunk and surprisingly they flirted with each other. They then went to the bathroom that was so clean and only has one toilet. They made out kissing tongue to tongue.<br />
<br />
The bully’s dad took off drunk Ryan’s pants and boxer briefs while Ryan manages to take off the bully’s dad’s pants and boxers . He lets the bully’s dad do what he wants. Ryan was drunk bending over and the bully’s dad inserted himself into Ryan. Ryan moaned quietly and let the bully’s dad continue. He didn’t know what he was doing but he liked it. The bully’s dad was releasing some of the essence into Ryan. Ryan, still drunk , absorbed the essence into his mind then turned around kneeling sucking the rest of the essence off and out of the bully’s dad’s thing .<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Ryan was getting better quickly and acting different. Ryan slowly got up and kisses the bully’s dad again with tongue. He hugged the bully’s dad and puts a wedding ring on his finger. He then went down to clean the bully’s dad. <br />
<br />
Ryan sealed himself then told the bully’s dad to go. Ryan’s memories got altered to make him the bully’s other dad and his eyes changed color. He smirked at his reflection and went to the car. He puts on his seatbelt and kisses the bully’s dad .<br />
<br />
Ryan: Don’t worry boys! I love my handsome sons too. <br />
He smiled at the bully and the older brother. Then, he continued to kiss the bully’s dad and went to the house.<br />
<br />
When they arrived, they were greeted by John and Adam. The bully and  Ronnie’ happily went to play with you and Matt. John, Adam, Tom, Ryan, The bully’s dad and Ronnie’s dad were talking then Tom kisses Ronnie’s dad and Ryan kisses The bully’s dad.  The bully hugged you and Ronnie hugged Matt and saw Nick who was in your older brother’s handsome body and his twin in Mr. Christopher’s body. <br />
<br />
Nick in your brother’s voice: go seal or use someone else’s body. <br />
<br />
Mr. Christopher nodded. Just then Timothee Chalamet found Tom and Ryan acting strange when John let him in but accepted that if that’s how they felt then he respect their choices. He then went to Mr. Christopher. He smiles at him not knowing a 6 year old was possessing a man’s body. When Tim looked into his eyes, he followed Mr Christopher to a room. He was under control by Nick’s twin. Tim was told to kiss Mr. Christopher with tongue And he did so. Later,  the hypnotized Tim was told to clean Mr . Christopher up.<br />
<br />
Tim: As you wish Jay!<br />
Tim smiles and saw that Mr. Christopher’s body has no undies and pants cause Jay had Mr. Christopher’s memories of loving jocks. Tim opened his mouth and sucked on Mr. Christopher’s boner.<br />
<br />
Jay chose to copy that memory into Tim and alter Mr. Christopher to be like the bodyguard. He would still have a feeling for jocks or muscled men .  He’s going after Jake Gyllenhaal to be his husband. His body was altered so they can make a family. Tim smirks going to Nick. <br />
<br />
They had “fun” then went to the wedding.</p>
