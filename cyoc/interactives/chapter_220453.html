<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At Goldie and Bear&#39;s house, everyone was indoors and could relax now that both Chenoa and her parents were safe and sound. Miles felt a little uncomfortable going up to Chenoa&#39;s parents and talking with them, but Chenoa pulled him over to her parents when she saw he was obviously shy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother, father, I want to introduce you both to the boy responsible for all this: Miles.&quot; Chenoa said. Tokala looked over the boy and nodded toward him. &quot;You&#39;ve done a great service to me and my family, thank you. I don&#39;t think I could ever repay you.&quot; Tokala said shaking Miles&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no sir, all I did was find Chenoa in the woods and bring her to my friends. Everyone else helped too.&quot; Miles said as Chenoa nuzzled him. Maka smiled at her daughter and couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. &quot;Don&#39;t be so modest young one. My daughter doesn&#39;t show affection like that to deer boys she&#39;s known for years.&quot; Maka said as Chenoa stopped and blushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now we...oh...my legs.&quot; Maka said as she tried to stand. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Tokala said as he helped his wife stand and she nodded back. &quot;My beautiful legs are mended but not healed. Goldie and Bear can only do so much with what they have.&quot; Maka said. &quot;I think she has some forearm crutches around here you can use to walk for a while.&quot; Tokala said as he helped his wife look for the crutches.<br />
<br />
Miles and Chenoa were then left alone and Chenoa looked to Miles with a little smile. &quot;I meant what I said you know. That without you, I wouldn&#39;t have found my godparents, my parents, my new friends, or you.&quot; Chenoa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well. You&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m just doing what&#39;s right.&quot; Miles said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have one question though.&quot; Chenoa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you.....have another sister I could date?&quot; Chenoa asked with a smile. &quot;Wait, what?!&quot; Miles asked confused before Chenoa giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister suggested I ask you that before I ask you my real question: do you want to go out with me?&quot; Chenoa asked as Miles leaned in slowly and they kissed each other on the lips for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes. I&#39;ll even ask my parents if I can go to your school.&quot; Chenoa said. &quot;That sounds great my dearly beloved.&quot; Miles said as Chenoa giggled. &quot; &#39;Dearly beloved&#39; I like that it&#39;s clever and we can both use it. You are heroic and clever Miles.&quot; Chenoa said giving him a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Connor had his arms wrapped around Spark as he hugged her lovingly. &quot;I was so worried about you. I heard your voice from that thing and I almost mistook it for you.&quot; Connor admitted. &quot;Yeah, I did too. I&#39;m glad we&#39;re both smarter than that.&quot; Spark said as Calista cleared her throat asking to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Spark, now that we&#39;re all good, I was wondering maybe you and Connor would like to meat up with my family? Mitch could finally talk to someone about hooking up with a fairy and you&#39;d get to meet my little Maggie.&quot; Calista suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah! That doesn&#39;t sound too bad actually. I&#39;d love to see her. Plus I think Mitch and Connor could relate some good stories. You&#39;ve also got to tell me all about your honeymoon.&quot; Spark said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re a little young to know about that?&quot; Calista joked with a wink.<br />
<br />
Goldie meanwhile was fixing up a meal for everyone as Sarah McMillan was talking with her. &quot;I still don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to explain some of this in my report file.&quot; Sarah said as Goldie thought for a second. &quot;Simple: A Cabin family assisted you in locating a missing Navajo couple and you fended off some rabid wildlife. I&#39;ve had to stretch the truth for a long time to keep good people safe.&quot; Goldie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all so much to take in, how did you manage to live with all this at the beginning?&quot; Sarah asked. &quot;Oh, well, I&#39;d have to start at the beginning to tell you.&quot; Goldie said. &quot;I&#39;ve got all the time I need.&quot; Sarah said as she looked at everyone in the room and noticed Michelle going to the front door of the cabin with a pack of cigarettes to smoke. She hadn&#39;t taken Michelle as the type to smoke, but that was probably the least surprising thing she&#39;d seen.<br />
<br />
********************************************************<br />
<br />
Michelle Wong stepped out onto the porch of the cabin and started to smoke her cigarette. As she looked through the woods, she noticed something moving not far away in the bushes. She thought about telling someone about it, but she didn&#39;t want to ruin the good mood everyone was in. She tossed her cigarette down as she quietly made her way over to the rustling bush and prayed that it was just a lost animal. Michelle looked over to see something bent over looking like it was having a meal and saw that it was rather large and wanted to take a step closer to it, she stepped on a branch breaking it make a sound and the creature turned around to show it was a skin walker.<br />
<br />
Michelle wanted to scream, but she couldn&#39;t, fear took her as she crawled backward on the ground as the creature crept closer to her with it&#39;s mouth drooling and it raised it&#39;s hand and was about to strike when she heard another strike come. Michelle looked down at herself to see she was still alive. Michelle looked to see the skin walker was beheaded and looked behind the creature to see two women standing behind the creature. One was a teenage girl dressed in a Victorian funeral gown complete with pillbox hat and veil while the other wore a blue Victorian gown and had a parasol with a hidden blade at the bottom that had sliced the creature&#39;s neck and looked a little older.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was that Mistress?&quot; The one in blue had asked. &quot;Exquisite darling. I see you even lured a human here for a little meal.&quot; The younger one said as she produced vampire fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you bite me, I&#39;ll call my magic friends for help.&quot; Michelle warned the woman. The woman stopped before she could go any closer and looked back to the cabin she had come from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does anyone in that cabin go by the name &#39;Moreland&#39;?&quot; The young girl asked. &quot;Uh...yes. Two in fact.&quot; Michelle replied. &quot;Damn it, I would stumble on someone who knows those bastards. Come along Duchess, we&#39;ll hunt more skin walkers elsewhere.&quot; The young girl said as she turned to walk away, the older woman almost following her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duchess....Jenkins?&quot; Michelle asked as the two stopped to turn and look at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m with the DHS. I had read about you and you vanished after turning in your partner for corruption. Are you....a vampire now?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed I am. Let me tell you, I have never felt more alive than when Mistress Cassandra turned me into a vampire.&quot; Duchess Jenkins said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But aren&#39;t vampires...evil?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The world isn&#39;t black and white, agent, it&#39;s always gray. That&#39;s what my beloved father, used to tell me.&quot; Cassandra said taking out a locket and looking at a picture of her father. &quot;Vampires aren&#39;t all evil, we&#39;re just misunderstood. The lord of the vampires has been making great changes to the world to better our kind and one day, if you&#39;re interested, call us.&quot; Cassandra said as she took out a card with a phone number on it and slipped it into Michelle&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been a pleasure talking with you.&quot; Duchess said as she kissed Michelle on the lips and stuck in her tongue in Michelle&#39;s mouth surprising her. &quot;Come Duchess, we must return home.&quot; Cassandra said as Duchess stood up. &quot;Yes, of course my mistress.&quot; Duchess Jenkins said as she wrapped her arm around Cassandra&#39;s arm and they walked off together.<br />
<br />
Michelle took the card out of her breast and looked at it. She then looked to Cassandra and Duchess both both had disappeared. She decided to head back to the cabin and not speak a word of this to the others. Instead she put the card back into her breast and went back to the porch and got out another cigarette.</p>
