<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Besides the Doll Suit incident the morning went fine. Pretty much all normal customers. The register wasn&#39;t difficult to learn just slow, and you had to reset the card reader like 5 times. <br />
Jess had mentioned that it didn&#39;t get too busy &#39;til the afternoon when people were out of work and school, and seasonally the last two weeks leading up to Halloween. Most people getting costumes were less about prepping and more about early Halloween parties coming up. <br />
<br />
At one point a man walked in, looked around and ignored Jess&#39;s greeting. <br />
<br />
You swept the floors and watched as he seemed transfixed by the back section and slowly walked in. <br />
<br />
You swept closer to Jess who was at register and whispered. <br />
&quot;Um are we supposed to let them go back there or... how does the whole costume trap thing work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a trap. If they want it, they get it. It&#39;s as simple as that.&quot; Jess rolled her eyes. <br />
<br />
You still felt bad. <br />
&quot;So we just don&#39;t do anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No we&#39;re not supposed to stop them.&quot; Jess said &quot;Unless it&#39;s like a little kid or a cop.&quot; <br />
<br />
You saw the guy again, no longer drawn in by the costumes, instead clutching a Football players outfit. He stared at it as if in a trance, and just walked out the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy!&quot; Jess called out, not trying to stop him, nor charge him. She went back to looking at a magazine on the counter. <br />
<br />
You were disturbed, wanting to run out and stop him. You set your broom against the counter and went to the door but when you pushed, it didn&#39;t open. As if it was locked. <br />
<br />
You shook it a few times, then looked at Jess. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you doing this?&quot; you asked. She was supposedly a witch after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; She blew a bubble with the bubble-gum she was chewing, and pointed &quot;But I see you got a collar on. Did Dad give that to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh yeah. You tugged at it. You&#39;d almost forgotten. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Uncle Jack told me not to leave the building.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess flipped another page nonchalantly.<br />
&quot;You know he actually used to ground me with that thing. He&#39;d put it on my leg though and said I was under house arrest. Guess he thought as a choker it&#39;d be too degrading.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I can imagine.&quot; You rolled your eyes sarcastically. Shook the door a few more times and went back to sweeping with a huff. <br />
<br />
These two were agitating you. You considered telling your parents. You hadn&#39;t actually checked your phone the entire time you&#39;d been here. And Uncle Jack hadn&#39;t forbade you from calling out. Now that you thought about it, you weren&#39;t sure where you left your phone. Without a real job or school right now, you often lived in the moment, not addicted to it like some people. <br />
Speaking of. <br />
You heard steps down the stairs and Uncle Jack appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey John. You ready to get that thing off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you find a cure?&quot; You dropped your broom in excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. What? Oh no. I need to pin your zipper on so it doesn&#39;t fall off. Haha then we&#39;d be in biiig trouble. We need to be able to still take it off after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your ears flattened annoyed and your tail drooped. <br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come upstairs, then you can run a little errand for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your legs were already following before you could object. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sit.&quot; Your Uncle told you once you were upstairs, while you sat on the couch. <br />
<br />
You rested your head in your hands. <br />
&quot;So does it hurt when you sew it in the skin I&#39;m wearing?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what I said downstairs? It&#39;s coming off. Gonna grab your zipper now, that&#39;s your warning.&quot; <br />
<br />
At least he remembered to warn you. Still. It felt like someone dropped cold water down your back. <br />
You stiffened up as he unzipped you, your skin no longer becoming your skin, seeing black, then light, then colors and taking a deep breath as your male form fell off of you like an overripe banana peel. <br />
You kicked it off onto the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, be gentle with that. It&#39;s your working skin.&quot; <br />
Your Uncle hurried around the couch and picked it up, taking it to the kitchen table with a sewing kit. <br />
<br />
Ugh you remembered what you were underneath. <br />
No longer a femboy, now you were just a girl. Though your original Maid form had blue hair and glasses... those somehow disappeared. It was like the Cat Ears and Tail had corrupted it somehow. Or maybe the cat eyes fixed your vision. Since your hair was black now, and you didn&#39;t have the giant knockers that came with the first costume either. <br />
<br />
You covered yourself up with a blanket, feeling obscene somehow for existing, and turned around to watch your Uncle work on your Man Suit, that now wore the nonMagicked form of the witch dress your cousin had given you. Just plain unhemmed Halloween fabric. No frills like when you had tried it on with all costumes together. <br />
<br />
&quot;So why can&#39;t you unzip this one?&quot; You pouted, trying not to think about your voice change. You sounded more feminine but to you it was annoyingly nasal. <br />
Your long hair was getting in your face and it was pissing you off. <br />
<br />
Your Uncle looked up from bifocals he had just put on. &quot;Try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You HAD thought it was weird that they hadn&#39;t even tried to get this one off yet. You reached behind for a zipper, and pulled. But only your dress began to come off. You rezipped it, and rushed to the bathroom, not engaging your wizard Uncle further. <br />
<br />
Locking the door you sat your petite self on the bathroom counter and tried to see the back. There was no zipper on your skin. Just a zipper on the fabric. You yanked again, letting the dress fall off your chest. It seemed the Maid dress was padded, since you weren&#39;t wearing a bra. You hadn&#39;t actually looked at them naked yet, but ... you had breasts. <br />
Cute, soft... You pinched a nipple and choked down a moan in case anyone was listening- nn... sensitive breasts. <br />
<br />
A little heartbeat awakened in your crotch, and you felt the distant sensations of a wetness in there. You cupped your breasts, looking at them. Looking at your reflection. You were supposed to be 19, now you looked... you weren&#39;t sure. Like a petite 15-17 year old? <br />
You took a breath and pulled more of the dress&#39;s zipper down and felt a pinch. <br />
You yoinked. <br />
Ow...<br />
<br />
You looked back trying to see where it was pinching your skin, and decided to pull harder. <br />
You yelped, angling to try and see. Finally picking up a hand mirror to attempt to view your own back. Touching it tenderly you realized you were bleeding. The dress seemed to meld into your skin at some point. The zipper not unzipping clean like the other costumes. Trying to pull it any further just resulted in pain and you couldn&#39;t see any hole that would imply your original skin being underneath. <br />
<br />
Standing in the middle of the bathroom floor you tried to shimmy the dress off but it got caught on your waist. The band where the costume came across your waist looked like it was glued to your skin. You pulled, but it just tugged your skin with it. <br />
You couldn&#39;t take off the dress. <br />
<br />
You tried to kick off your shoes to no avail either. You tugged your stockings but it was acting like it was part of your skin as well. You had tried your ears this morning but once again, just pulled on your scalp. <br />
Grunting in frustration you lifted your skirt and took off your panties. <br />
<br />
Oh. <br />
<br />
That one worked. <br />
You kicked them off and sat down on the bathroom floor trying to look at it. <br />
No longer did you have a dick, not even a sissy tiny one. Instead there was your hair and ... folds. You tenderly touched it but didn&#39;t go any further. But as you sat you were reminded.... <br />
That damn tail.<br />
<br />
All your moving and adjusting, you had just been trying to ignore it, but it was like a phantom butt plug. You knew it wasn&#39;t actually in your ass it was like phased into your spine, but still... you felt it. That&#39;s what had been giving you that weird fullness feeling in your balls when you were male. You reached around trying to tug that too, it hurt. Pulling harder with a grunt. You felt... a slip?<br />
<br />
Hello? What was that??<br />
<br />
It hurt but... you continued to pull with all your strength, feeling it wiggle. <br />
You hoped your Uncle wasn&#39;t worrying too much about you, as you finally yoinked it free, whipping it across the bathtub and knocking over a few shampoo bottles. <br />
<br />
Holy shit you got it out! <br />
<br />
Your stomach dropped as it went from limp to glowing blue in the plug part. It suddenly pointed at your crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!&quot; You tried to hold it back, as it acted like a homing device, trying to get back into your ass. Finally slipping from your hands, you covered your butt, trying to make sure it wouldn&#39;t hit you there again. <br />
You fell back kicking at it, when you felt it make contact. <br />
But not with your butt. <br />
<br />
You gasped, as it shoved itself into your... <br />
Your... <br />
You could see it, you could feel it. A weird place for a tail, stuck in your pussy. You automatically flinched and felt it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh..&quot; you covered your mouth, again hoping no one was listening. Your face was bright red.<br />
Oh.<br />
It felt. It felt good...<br />
You tried to yoink it out, but it just resulted in an artificial thrust of it slipping, then plugging back in. <br />
&quot;Nn&quot; you squinted, trying to yoink it again, and again, but it just kept zoinking back, zinging you each time. <br />
Fuck it was getting you wet. Filling you... Why did it feel so big? It didn&#39;t look that big? Was it because you weren&#39;t used to having a pussy it just felt huge going into your cunt? <br />
<br />
You pulled it, twisting, trying to force it out. Instead it glowed blue and went deep.<br />
Deep inside. <br />
<br />
You choked a yelp into a towel, twisting it in your hands, feeling your eyes tear up, as it burrowed inside of you, curling up onto your side, you felt it... shifting. <br />
Gasping for air, you sat on your side, and felt for it between your legs. You could.... ugh feel it filling you in there. Any time you flexed your kegels it felt good, rolling around like a yoni egg. Not that you&#39;d known what that felt like... until now. <br />
It was wet. And... you looked down, you didn&#39;t see the end?<br />
You positioned yourself better, opening your legs. But? Wait you could still feel it in there?<br />
<br />
You stood up, and saw it in the mirror, phased back into your spine. Just like it had done with your ass before, but now in your cunt. You pushed your legs together. <br />
<br />
Was this worse?<br />
<br />
Ughh you could feel it in there, your face was flush and you were super turned on by the sensation. Walking to the toilet to grab toilet paper to wipe your fluids off, you could feel a phantom sensation in there. But as you sat on the toilet and explored, slowly working your fingers inside, you couldn&#39;t feel it with your hand. You could only feel it with your insides. <br />
<br />
Ghost filled. <br />
<br />
Your tail puffed and your whole body shivered and jumped as you heard a knock at the bathroom door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any luck?&quot; Your Uncle asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;N-No...&quot; you uttered back. You didn&#39;t want to tell him about this. It wasn&#39;t that different than how it had been before anyway. <br />
You choked a moan into a towel again, and cleaned yourself up. Pulling your panties back on, pulling the straps of your dress back over your shoulders. Fixing your long hair. But as you shifted from foot to foot you could still feel it in there. Any time you squeezed your kegels. Any time you walked. You were about to try to yoink it out again and see if maybe you could trap it somehow when you Uncle called in. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re dressed come out here please?&quot; <br />
<br />
You sighed, obediently unlocking the door, hoping he didn&#39;t see how sweaty you were. <br />
<br />
Thankfully he wasn&#39;t even looking at you, he was back to trying to his work on your skin suit. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to pick up an order. You&#39;re in luck, you can leave the building for this. Assuming of course you won&#39;t run away?&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed. <br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ll be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had no idea how you would return home looking like this anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, it&#39;s two blocks down the street, little Thai food place. It&#39;s paid for, you just need to bring it back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Uncle Jack.&quot;<br />
-----<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t want to be seen in public in a maid outfit so you stole a turtleneck sweater dress from Jess&#39;s closet to pull over it. You had shown your Uncle how even your stockings didn&#39;t want to budge off your skin, but at the moment the worst part was... walking. <br />
<br />
Hurrying down the stairs of the place was so far the more intense part of feeling a phantom plug in your pussy. But as you walked your face was still red. Feeling it jostle around pleasurably with every step. <br />
You stood waiting at a cross walk, squeezing your kegels and feeling it in there pushing against your insides. Ugh. <br />
It was nice but.. wrong. So wrong. You were like some kinky freak in public. Walking around with a metal plug in your... <br />
<br />
You shivered. <br />
The sweater was a good idea. Though the shop was pretty warm, in this town Autumn had definitely hit. It was already getting chilly out even this early in the afternoon. <br />
<br />
A man passed you from behind and tugged your tail, you whipped it away. He kept walking chuckling. <br />
&quot;Celebrating Halloween early huh, sweetie?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ew. <br />
But you guessed you did look exactly like a girl now. Well you were a girl now. Completely physically. You could see yourself in a window across the street. Stockings, little shoes, long hair and nekomimi accessories. <br />
<br />
You felt your neck realizing something. <br />
When the top costume was off... you didn&#39;t have your collar on. <br />
Interesting. Your mind ticked with how you could use that to your advantage, but you couldn&#39;t think of much now. <br />
<br />
Hurrying to do your errand, it didn&#39;t stop the rubbing on the inside. At least no one could tell how wet you were. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t sit down to enjoy your lunch with everyone when you got back. As soon as your Uncle said he was done sewing the zipper on(so it wouldn&#39;t fall off leaving you stuck in this mess) you grabbed it and ran to the bathroom to pull it on. <br />
Not that you needed the privacy of the bathroom for it, maybe it was habit for putting on clothes in general. <br />
<br />
It felt the same as before. You got taller, your hair was shorter. You sighed with relief, the outfit&#39;s ruffles filling out your dress again. Thank god, you had a penis again. You walked to the toilet to take a leak and discovered. <br />
You were ... super hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geez what the hell little dude...&quot; you whispered blushing. Needing to pee. But... you squeezed your legs. <br />
Kind of like before. Buried deep inside you could still feel it. It still felt like you could feel it in your cunt but.. you didn&#39;t even have one. <br />
Not to mention the swollen feeling of something in your balls returning. <br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; you blushed, but knew you couldn&#39;t mention it to anyone. You&#39;d just have to live with your silent secret, turning you on. <br />
----<br />
<br />
You decided to eat your lunch downstairs, you needed the space. And your extended relatives were happy to have someone on the floor so they didn&#39;t have to close for an hour. <br />
<br />
You had also learned to eat fast from previous retail jobs. You were a little sick to your stomach anyway. Feeling ... honestly just fucking horny. <br />
<br />
The more you squeezed your legs together the more you could feel it. And though your dick wasn&#39;t being directly affected, it seemed like it was more than happy to throb and stand at attention. <br />
<br />
Ugh you wanted to fuck something really bad. Or hump a pillow or something...<br />
<br />
The door jingled and you forced yourself to push those thoughts away. A young black woman with an afro walked in, and you had to leave the counter to greet her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you sell costume shoes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh.&quot; Most costume shops didn&#39;t actually. They just didn&#39;t have the storage to stock all the different shoe sizes on top of an inventory of costumes. But you actually knew this one did. In a one-size-fits-all section. One you could actually see from the door along with some other accessories, but it was on the magic side of the store. Jess wasn&#39;t here, she couldn&#39;t stop you trying to veto a sale. <br />
&quot;No&quot; you answered, trying to save her. You motioned to your sneakers that didn&#39;t match your dress &quot;As you can see...&quot; you tried to reason. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there it is.&quot; she brightened up, seeing the accessory wall in the back. She went straight to it and you drudged after her. &quot;You see I&#39;m looking for...&quot;</p>
