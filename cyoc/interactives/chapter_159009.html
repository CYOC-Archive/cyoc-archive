<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate sat at the desk in his bedroom staring at the little baggie of nondescript white powder. He had obtained it the prior weekend at a local horror convention. He was one of the lucky few to manage to score some before the police showed up and arrested the dealer. He had heard about Lunar Ecstasy and thought it was too good to be true. But now he had some and he was wondering if he even dared to take it. The dealer only told him that stuff would make all his dreams of being a werebeastie come true. <br />
<br />
To Nate, the idea of this actually being true seemed like an impossibility. It was something that could never happen. And yet, he’d seen the news reports, the YouTube videos and read the reports online. It was real. He’d watched the videos countless times of people transforming from human to animal. Everything from a Wolf to a Tiger, to a Bear to a Lion to even reptilian creatures that looked more like a dinosaur or dragon. Nate was a teenage boy at the tender age of 16, living with his parents and brother in an upper middle class suburb in Minnesota. It was the very definition of benign and boring. Maybe a rampaging werebeastie would liven things up around here. He had fantasized about being one long enough, he wasn’t about to let a chance to live it out pass him by. <br />
<br />
“Screw it,” Nate whispered as he stood up and walked into his bathroom, flicking on the light. He opened the tiny Ziploc baggie and downed the entire contents at once. He filled up the glass on the counter with some water and took a swig to wash the rest of it down. He leaned up against the counter waiting for something, anything to happen. When it didn’t, he walked out of the bathroom and across the room. He opened his bedroom window and looked out into the quiet night. Directly below the window was the roof to the Family room of their house and from there an easy drop to the ground below. He figured it would be prudent to leave a exit route for his werebeastie self, especially since his family was still home. He reached up to try and open the window wider when he saw the small hairs growing all over the back of his arms and hands. He let out a gasp and ran to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
“Oh no way…” Nate peered at his reflection in the mirror. For the first time in his life, he had a serious five o’clock shadow all over his face and neck. He quickly pulled off his shirt and pants and tossed them in the corner by the bathtub. When he looked back in the mirror, he saw that his canine teeth were looking a bit longer and sharper. He smiled a wide grin, getting a better look. They were getting longer and sharper by the second. <br />
<br />
He cried out as one by one his thin fingernails tore away as a thick, sharp claw grew in its place. He held his hands up and watched in awe as the claws grew in. His cock grew hard as he let out a moan of pleasure. This felt so good. He gripped the marble countertop as his back muscles began to slowly grow and his chest began to barrel outwards. <br />
<br />
There was a knock on his bedroom door. His heart stopped for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate? Honey?&quot; It was his Mom, Maggie. &quot;Did you want to watch a movie with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...no thanks.&quot; It was harder to enunciate with his growing fangs. He saw a stream of drool drop from his mouth as he tried to talk. &quot;I&#39;m busy with something in here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, just thought I&#39;d ask.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nate let out another moan of pleasure as he ran his now paw like hand through his thick, shaggy brown fur, feeling his tightening muscles underneath. He pitched forward as his feet began to grow and reform, each into digitigrade paws. He let out another moan as he felt his face begin to push out and reform. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...yes…&quot; he whispered in a low growl. The snout pushed out a little further. His ears grew to points as his lupine snout finished growing. He opened his maw as wide as he could, admiring the large, sharp fangs. <br />
<br />
Nate took a step back and admired his newly transformed, werewolf self. He flexed his new muscles and let out a low growl. He slowly walked around his bedroom, getting used to walking on his paws. As he did he began to feel his horniness rising. He felt so good in his new form and needed a release. He climbed out his open window and dropped down to the roof of the family room with ease. He ran along the roof and jumped down to the grass below, landing with a soft thud. He froze in terror as this triggered the motion sensor on the backyard lights as he realized he just landed in front of the large family room windows, as his family sat just on the other side watching a movie.</p>
