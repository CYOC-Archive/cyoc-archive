<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So now that your body is nearly fully encased let´s continue, Aidan. I want your shoes to turn into cloth, much like your socks are, but the soles will remain a bit harder while losing their profile, making them flat and a bit slick. Your sleeves will stretch towards your sock-gloves, as will your jeans-legs until they reach your socks. And the underwear on your head will stretch all the way down to the collar of your shirt. The leg openings will close mostly while moving to your eyes, leaving them the only not covered part of your body. But the smelly part of the underwear will stay by your nose, a nice mix between piss and shit. Also very fitting to your sock-gag, I believe you hadn´t changed either of them in a couple of days.” Mark said, starting to laugh again.<br />
<br />
Aidan was still gagging at the smell of his boxers over his nose and the taste of the sweaty sock-gag only replied a “Mmmmpft!”, unable to voice anything. His gagging increased when both the smell and taste turned worse for Marks last comment. He had changed both this morning, but now they seemed more like a week unchanged to him.<br />
<br />
The pressure of his shoes eased when they soften from leather to cloth. While his jeans nearly reached his socks before and only stretched a bit further down it felt weird when his shirt sleeves crawled down his arms until they reached the sock-gloves. The rim of his underwear traveled downwards, covering his sock-gag, with looked more like a small snout now, until it slipped inside his shirt collar. Then he could suddenly see again, but the holes shrunk smaller, closing around his eyes until they remained the only not covered part of his face and body, the cloth ending just at the eyes outlines.<br />
<br />
Again Aidan gave a “Mmmmpft?”, only sounding more question-like then before. He still had no idea what Mark had wanted to access with this changes at all.<br />
<br />
Mark smiled at the question marks in Aidans eyes. “Still no idea? Maybe you get it before I´m finished. Let´s see. You will form fists and will be unable to open them again. Your sock-gloves will reform a smooth surface above your fingers. From the outside it will look like a mitten instead of a glove. Your feet will bend upwards until your toes touch your legs. Like your sock-gloves your cloth-shoes will look like mittens around your feet. When both is finished your sock-gloves will merge with your sleeves while your cloth-shoes fuse with your socks and merge with your jeans-legs.”<br />
<br />
Aidan felt his fingers bending until he had balled fists. He could see the sock-gloves smooth over, leaving no indication of separate fingers underneath. A shot of pain let Aidan remember what else Mark had said and looked down in shock and pain as his feet bend upwards, breaking the bones in both of his feet. He cried in pain while letting out a also pained “MMMMPFT!”. Not that it stopped his feet or the pain. Finally his toes hit his legs and in a second his shoes had fused with his socks and merged with his jeans without any seam to indicate what was underneath and where which clothes had been before. He didn´t even realize the merging of his sleeves with the sock-gloves.<br />
Seeing Aidans tears and the slowly soaking underwear Mark decided: “You are unable to shed tears any longer. The pain can not cloud your mind and will lessen when your bones heal the way they are now, but never go away completely.”<br />
<br />
Aidan felt his lacrimal glands dry out. Even if he wanted to he could no longer shed tears. At the same time his mind cleared from the pain clouds but he felt it still as strong as before, letting him whimper and moan in it. It slowly got better while his bones healed in their new position until it was only half the pain from before.<br />
<br />
Mark grinned at Aidan before he continued again. “The former sole of your shoes will move down to the bottom of your changed legs. A similar plate like that soles will form on both ends of your arms. Next both your arms and legs will straighten out, leaving your knees and elbows stretched. You will be unable to move them afterwards. Your balls will detach from your cock and move around until they are above your ass. They will even merge into one bigger ball and be very sensitive. The cum inside will relocate itself into your sock-gag and stay there, leaving your ball empty. And your jeans and shirt will merge under your belt which will turn into cloth as well.”<br />
<br />
While the moving of the sole or the creating of something similar on his hands didn´t stir any reaction from Aidan, the sudden stretching of his arms and legs did. The feeling was really uncomfortable, but he couldn´t do anything against it. A muffled moan escaped him for his moving and merging balls and if he could he would have cummed when it reached its destination above his ass. But his cum vanished out of his ball and inside his gag, letting it expand a bit inside his mouth. He didn´t even realize his changing leather belt into a cloth one around his now merged shirt and jeans before it also fused with them.<br />
<br />
Mark waited smiling evilly at Aidans pleasure. He could still enjoy it, but for how much longer could only Mark say.<br />
After a minute Mark made the next comment. “The sock around your cock will harden as an encasement while the end will also fuse with your jeans. Then your cock will be pushed in. It will stay as fully erect as it is now, but from the outside it can´t be seen after the push in. Someone seeing you would think you are smooth down there. Your final separate clothes, the underwear and the sock-gag, will merge together and with your shirt collar, letting your whole body encased forever.”<br />
<br />
Aidan had heard Marks comment and while his body was both pleasured and pained he looked horrified at Mark. It started with much pressure on his cock from all sides as the sock hardened. Before Mark wanted it formfitting and through the hardening it got a bit smaller, squeezing his cock inside painfully. But that was nothing against the pain when it was pushed back still fully erect. Aidan felt as if either his cock or his pelvis would be crushed and broken in the end. His jeans was pulled back as well, given it the look of an empty place between his legs. A slight pull came from his sock-gag as it fused with the underwear around his head. Then his shirt collar merged with it, closing the last gap to separate his clothes. Other than his eyes there wasn´t any opening left, no skin visible anymore. Without destroying the clothes Aidan would never get them off alone again.</p>
