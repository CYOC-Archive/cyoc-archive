<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was some time later as he was late for school. As he was attending his classes at school that a cute, but young sorceress was a singed to Jeff as he was now going to be hers, even though he got the impression of her being a high school age student like him. Once the school ended that she and Jeff went straight to the zoo, along with the accompany of her fellow classmates as they too brought their boys to be turned into what they wanted.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw most of the group glance at each other, before they all went there separate was that some of the people walking around seemed odd, but he couldn&#39;t get a clear look as he knew something was off about them. One of the group went to the rabbits and turned him into one as he others went to the bears, raccoons, deers, even to the dragons. Wait, dragons?! Jeff started to wonder what option did he choose to be as for six hours that they soon come to an exhibit, but what Jeff didn&#39;t know by then was jeff&#39;s sorceress favorite animal wasn&#39;t a normal creature at all.<br />
<br />
There were exhibits so mythical that they passed exhibits like dragons, griffens, hippocampuses, even chimeras of different kinds, and more as we finally arrived to her favorite mythology creature of them all. Jeff looked at it as he thought it was something cool like a minotaur, a sphinx, or even something related to a beast under a full moon&#39;s light (which he was thinking about werewolves) that what ha saw in the exhibit had wings and a lion&#39;s mane as he knew what his selecion was. It was manticore as it had white fur with a golden mane and tail, it&#39;s wings were that of a fire birds (phoenix) as it didn&#39;t had a scorpion&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
When he finally looked back to her that his eyes grow large as she was now wearing in form-fitting armor with a sword around her belt. She looked like an intents purposes knight, or even a modern-day battle-maiden that Jeff trembled involuntarily, but mostly in fear as he some how was with a ravishing strong looking sorceress in a cleavage tin can armor. Even though she somehow changed outfits as this did frustrated him for it that he did wanted to be a strong and beautiful looked as he wasn&#39;t complaining about what he&#39;ll be for her, but what came nect stun Jeff even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, let&#39;s see how you turn out, after you strip of your clothes.&quot; She was strict with him at first, but she soon gaveJeff a reason why she wanted him to do it in front of her. &quot;Please do it, i don&#39;t want you to tear up your clothes when you turn back.&quot; Feeling a bit flustered as she hands him a bag to put them in that jeff did as he was told and began to undress himself, even his under pants.<br />
<br />
Putting his clothes in the bag a he was stripped naked that while he handed her the bag filled with his clothes, she was pointing her sword at him and murmured words in a language Jeff couldn&#39;t quite understand. As he was thinking what language she was saying is where a bright ray of colorful lights beam on him that he didn&#39;t noticed a seal of magic under him. Soon, there was flash of light from the seal as it rose fron the earth floor and flooted up till it went over his head that he stood there blank when she finished what he thought was a spell. Blinking a couple of times that he felt off while trying to get his eyes to adjust.<br />
<br />
When he finaly got his eyes to adjust as his body twitch from this experience that before he could do or say anything, she kneeled down and planted a kiss, lips to lips. this made Jeff&#39;s eye grew wide as he blush from this sudden surprise kiss when she slipped her tongue pass both his lips and into his mouth that jeff knew this was wrong in so many ways a this was his first kiss, not even eye level anymore, and was on all fours as he was screaming in the back of his mind when she did his first kiss with her. Wait, all fours?! This really wanted him to scream out of his mind and fight back, but then remembered what she would punish me and turn me into a plush form of what form i&#39;m in if i get into fights that she soon releases her kiss and started to say something to him as she was brething out of breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;As my new familiar, you&#39;re going to my manticore as they&#39;re my favorites, but for six hours only as you&#39;ll sill be my pet. Between now as school ended till bedtime that each weekdays is where we&#39;ll be coming here to choose your form, except for weekends as i&#39;ll let you pick out what animal form you want to be when we got on our six hour date. Everyone will think nothing of it that you may not know me, but my name is Linzzy and i know we&#39;ll get along quite nicely. I&#39;ll let you look yourself now as you&#39;re wondering about what happened to your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
After she placed a hand under his chin and itch it a bit that true to her words, Linzzy let Jeff see himself over as he lifted his hands to only see them as lion&#39;s paws instead. turning his head bach is where he could see a set of wings on fire and a lion&#39;s tail. Horrified as the fire wasn&#39;t burning him on his back as his body was covered in a layer of white fur that he clearly had two wings made of fire, which were srouting while mounted on his back. they even look like there&#39;s red feathers under the fire, if jeff decided to look hard enough at them. His nose even seemed to be a bit triangular and yellow, although he did had a muzzle of a lion which was filled with fangs that even his feet were paws.<br />
<br />
What startled him the most however was that he looked exactly like the one in the exhibit, only he was a bit smaller in size to it that jeff thought it was biger because it was older then him. Placing his paws back on the grown while feeling the pads under each of them, even his new hind legs that he noticed the fur covered a sheath as it was now holding his gentaia. Fully checking himself over as he was processing of being a manticore while panting that Linzzy gently sat on your back as her hands were on your golden mane head, (which felt nice when she ruffled and scratch it) and your butt rear as it made him jump with a twitch.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a slight stirring feeling in his sheath when Linzzy touched his rum rear, although he did thought she was very attractive that she looked well-proportion to where it counts. To be honest with himself that he always did wanted to be a large beast as he wanted to thank her, but his words only came out as roars as he had to show it to her instead. Knowing now he can&#39;t use his english speach as he had to use his body language that Linzzy soon, yet quickly lifted her leg over him and sat it on jeff&#39;s over side of body while still holding a bag of his clothes and started riding him like a horse. Still no use to his new body as he stumbled quite  a bit of time that she wanted him to fly somewhere, but where?</p>
