<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As pound after pound of rank shit forced it's way out of her ass as her new servants fed her, but something <br />
didn't seem right, and she couldn't place her finger on it and as she snorted her mind wandered again, wishing <br />
once again to be smart, but this time she wished that she would become the smartest person on earth and her IQ <br />
would start to increase whenever she passed anything. After about ten seconds the amulet sparkled and the <br />
office was filled with the sound of a deep bassy fart reverberated throughout the office, causing the fog that <br />
once filled Alissa's brain to exit hastily through out her rear end with another three or four lb turds. When <br />
her intelligence returned Alissa became aware of ways to shit non-stop without effort. Quickly Alissa lifted <br />
her leg and bent slightly, this caused a large wet fart to exit her rear splattering one of the servants face <br />
brown, covering up the blush that was underneath. Approximately 5 seconds later Alissa's ass started to <br />
release a never ending sea of poop that quickly created a 10 foot wide pile below her, growing about a foot <br />
every minute. About five minutes later when the 20 foot wide, 10 foot long, 5 foot high creation was finished <br />
she stood back straight up and quickly wished that everyone in the office would have regular bowl movements <br />
every 2-3 hours, making up for the horrendous experience the rest of her co workers faced when they started <br />
farting uncontrollably causing a few of them to release waves and waves of diarrhea into their panties. <br />
<br />
  After a few more burritos, Alissa developed very bad indigestion causing her previous wish to come true, <br />
this time the amount of future slobs increased from 4 to 20 as 16 of her co workers burst into her office <br />
releasing devastating wet farts as they dove to the ever growing pile of food in Alissa's office. The three of <br />
her remaining co workers were walking outside of Alissa's office when their bowels rumbled as rapid rancid <br />
farts escaped their asses causing Alissa to turn and watch as one of her co workers squatted really low <br />
releasing some low rumbling farts before she saw her pants expand continuously for about 5 minutes indicating <br />
that she was on her way to Jane's office to steal a diaper. As for the other two Alissa only had to wait about <br />
five more minutes before they both were walking back and they squatted, determined not to shit their clean <br />
panties both women were able to slip their pants and panties off and hold their ass cheeks together as they <br />
took short stumbling steps into Alissa's office, found the pile she had started earlier and released their <br />
bowels, after a long period of time they appeared to be finished, but then one of them sharply grasped her gut <br />
and a stream of diarrhea came out seemingly non-stop for 5 more minutes before it was cut off by a sputtering <br />
wet fart followed by a stream of urine. Finally Alissa was able to get rid of her horrible indigestion by <br />
releasing a huge belch that seemed to go on for an eternity smashing many windows in her office building. <br />
<br />
  After that Alissa decided to create a world where all these slobs could live in happiness, all they had to <br />
do was eat, be gassy and shit for the rest of their lives, so with confidence she said &quot;I wish that reality <br />
would shift and man would disappear leaving only women living on a continent of slobs with me as their queen&quot; <br />
and with that reality shifted as her servants who were once skinny young ladies slowly expanded releasing hell <br />
into their panties and finally one by one would take their undergarments off to let solid shit to pass through <br />
their quickly expanding gassy asses, as more and more women felt Alissa's final wish, the new queen of the <br />
slobs quickly realized that she was gaining weight at a rapid pace, her ass raised her up 15 feet her stomach <br />
started to pool around her sides as it raised itself past her sides, her arms and legs quickly became useless <br />
as they were swallowed up by fat, now the only movement that Alissa was able to make was jiggling caused by <br />
her gas and her ass cheeks could open as she shit. Finally Alissa realized a mistake and was quick to fix it <br />
by wishing that the amulet would stay around her neck forever, and she also wished that she would similarly to <br />
a queen bee lay thousands of eggs weekly having three or four hatch hourly creating the new generation of <br />
slobs. <br />
<br />
  About three months later queen Alissa laid her final egg wishing that her egg production would turn into <br />
more shit production, her highness was fed by the rebels who wished to stay skinny, she was cleaned once a <br />
year for a speech that was broadcast through the transmitter she had every slob get implanted in their eyes, <br />
allowing them to lay anywhere and watch television, and she was happy. <br />
<br />
