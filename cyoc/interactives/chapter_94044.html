<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you stood there wondering what to do your stomach gave a little gurgle letting you know that it was empty and wanted to be filled. You shrugged your shoulders and decided to see if you could find the kitchen. Thinking back over yesterday&#39;s exploration you remember a door that you think might be what you&#39;re looking for, you just have to hope that you can find it again soon.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of walking around you spied the door and opened it. What you found inside was a bit of a surprise. There was a long table with a lot of chairs and food piled onto it. Sitting around the table were six &quot;people&quot;. One looked like what most people think of when they hear werewolf, one looked like a female clown, one was putting food into a mouth on his chest, another looked like a koala bear, another one looked like a classic male demon, and the last one looked like a female angel. They all turned to look at you when you walked in and the clown said, &quot;I wasn&#39;t aware that any of the others had transformed to where they could join us for breakfast. So which one are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both the angel and demon had their heads cocked like they were listening to something and before you could respond to the clown&#39;s question the angel said, &quot;She&#39;s new Dottie, just went through her first transformation last night.&quot; She then looked at the demon and said, &quot;Oh Adam we had wanted children before we came here. Let&#39;s adopt her as our daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Eve we&#39;ll adopt her if she agrees,&quot; Adam said with a creepy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come sit by me and have some breakfast,&quot; Eve said motioning you over to a chair next to her. &quot;I know you must have some questions and we&#39;ll answer them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hesitated for a moment not sure if you wanted to get close to any of them but then your stomach gurgled again. You were really hungry and the food smelled so good. With a little inward sigh you head over to the table and start eating. As you dug into the food there Adam said, &quot;Allow me to introduce everyone. My name is Adam and this angel here is my wife Eve. Dottie is our resident clown though she doesn&#39;t clown around much with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no one ever said I had to act like a clown 24/7,&quot; Dottie said rolling her eyes and interrupting Adam.<br />
<br />
Adam looked a little annoyed but then continued on with, &quot;Next we have John the werewolf, who&#39;s almost always in wolf form.&quot; John gave a little nod and Adam continued, &quot;The koala is Mary and next to her is Mort.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Mort said with his regular mouth while stuffing the mouth on his chest.<br />
<br />
No one else seemed like they were going to say anything else so with the edge taken off of your hunger you looked at Eve and said, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that you can&#39;t adopt me. As soon as I&#39;m finished eating I&#39;m going to find a way to turn back and then get back to my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sweetie you can never regain the form you originally had and you can&#39;t leave the grounds,&quot; Eve said looking a little sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why do you say that?&quot; you asked with raised brows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you ignored the no trespassing sign,&quot; Mort said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve all ignored it,&quot; Adam said laughing a little. &quot;So as punishment whoever or whatever created this house traps us within the grounds. If you try to leave you&#39;ll be transformed into a squirrel or something and you&#39;ll scamper away from the boundaries. Also as part of the punishment you give up your former form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is some kind of fucked up prison?&quot; You asked in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it&#39;s a prison,&quot; Dottie said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And little girls shouldn&#39;t swear,&quot; Eve said with a stern look and wagging a finger at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christ I&#39;m not a little girl,&quot; you said rolling your eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now,&quot; Adam said with a smile. &quot;Tell me something. Did it bother you when you found out what you had transformed into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no,&quot; you admitted after thinking for a bit. &quot;I know I should be upset and freaking out over it but it just seems normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because you are a little girl now,&quot; Eve said smiling. &quot;Just like I&#39;m an angel and Adam is a demon. Like John is a werewolf and Dottie is a clown. These were our first transformations upon entering this house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Mary and Mort?&quot; you asked wondering about them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I turned into a toilet and Mary turned into a little girl&#39;s swimsuit,&quot; Mort said laughing. &quot;So if you need to pee I&#39;m happy to be of service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; you shouted your eyes going wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mort&#39;s a toilet even when he&#39;s in another form,&quot; Adam said smiling. &quot;Before you ask yes he does spend most of his time in toilet form and he dislikes being in any other form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m made to stay in one place and to be the receptacle for bodily waste,&quot; Mort said frowning. &quot;That&#39;s when I&#39;m happiest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so next question,&quot; you said wanting to get away from the discussion about Mort being a toilet. &quot;Why are we in a prison for just ignoring a no trespassing sign?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s not just that,&quot; Eve said smiling. &quot;It&#39;s because we&#39;ve intentionally broken the law many times before and were never caught. That is we were never caught by any mortal law enforcement. Some of us only had minor infractions like speeding or running red lights. Others had more serious infractions up to and including murder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; you said holding up your hands. &quot;Are you saying there are murderers here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Eve said shrugging. &quot;Though you don&#39;t have to worry because you won&#39;t die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; you asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you die you&#39;ll just reform in your room like you are now,&quot; Eve said.<br />
<br />
You rolled your eyes not sure if you really believed that or not. You didn&#39;t want to dwell on it however so you asked, &quot;How does someone transform here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there are various ways like going into a painting though you should refrain from doing that as it&#39;s hard to get back out,&quot; Adam said. &quot;You could wear something, sleep somewhere, eat or drink something, or just randomly transform to name a few.&quot; You looked down at your plate in horror wondering if you were going to transform into a chicken or maybe a pig. &quot;Don&#39;t worry too much about the food and drink transforming you,&quot; Adam continued seeing the look on your face. &quot;We haven&#39;t seen anyone transform from eating Harriet&#39;s cooking. I mentioned it as a possible way. Now I have a question for you. Will you be mine and Eve&#39;s daughter?&quot;</p>
