<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim moved through the shadows in the early morning light as she stalked toward the cabin. Thanks to the newest member of the lion pride, Jason they knew who remained in the house. On the first floor was Jason’s soon to be wife Jennifer who was making breakfast, she was Barbara’s cousin and Jason’s mate so she was marked to join the lion pride as it’s 6th member and it’s 4th lioness. The other three where Jason’s younger brother Tim and his girlfriend Amy, the two of them shared a room but Tim was on guard duty in the living room. He had a shotgun and the others had handguns and a single rifle, none of those where a real threat to their harden skin expect if they got hit in the eye. The other person in the house was Jennifer’s best friend Stacy who in the smallest guest room. Stacy’s fate was still up in the air, but as for Tim and Amy, they were hers. <br />
<br />
That had been a little bit of an argument but in the end it was agreed that even though she was a part of the lion pride as a jaguar she deserved to have a mate or two of her own. It helped that neither two males lioness wanted a 3rd male to fight for control of the pride and having 3 jaguars to help cover issues that the lion had would help this combined pride last longer in the long run. The lions would be stronger and tougher in a fight but jaguars where nimbler and where much better stalkers then lions. They would cover each other’s weakness and together last longer. <br />
<br />
Kim moved to the side of the house and a large tree which sat beside the house, digging into the side of one of the trees with her claws she began to climb. Climbing was another thing which the lions lacked, she moved to the small roof which covered the wrap around porch and began to walk on all fours on it. Her padded feet kept her movement all but undetectable, it helped that she heard the sounds of pots and pans coming from the kitchen and a now load TV coming in from the living room area. She moved to the window which was supposed to lead to Tim’s and Amy’s bedroom. She did a quick glance and saw a door closing and a figure still asleep in the nearby bed. She waited for a moment and heard running water as some steam began to come from under the door which had just closed, she tried the window and with ease it opened up…she smiled showing her teeth. She could not have timed this better if she tried. <br />
<br />
She pushed the window upwards and, on all fours, entered the bedroom, once in she stood up and moved toward the sleeping figure. She had a feeling who it was judging by the shape, she was right. Sleeping there, her black hair framing her face was Amy. She was very good looking with a very large bust and nice body, she seemed to be in her early 20s which made her a few years younger than Kim herself. Kim’s new animal lush began to go into overdrive. Yes, she would have a wonderful time with Amy.  Kim moved to remove the blanket and smiled even more; Amy seemed to like to sleep in the nude. <br />
<br />
That made the process all the easier she simply moved forward and licked Amy’s womanhood, her tongue was covered with the virus and touching it so close to Amy’s womanhood was enough to get the virus in her system. She licked her a few times and with each moment the virus began to change her. Amy began to wake moaning a bit. <br />
<br />
The sound of water shutting off from the attached bathroom warned Kim as she moved back as the door opened as Jason’s brother Tim walked in with only a towel wrapped around his waist. Kim had moved back into a corner and out of view of Tim. Tim looked good as well, strong body, broad shoulders and while not totally built he was just the type of man who Kim would have slept with when she was a human. Now there was only one thing left to do and Amy would do it for her. <br />
<br />
Tim looked at the bed and saw his girlfriend, legs spread and looking at him with lust in her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Come here.” Ordered Amy in a husky voice which was full of sex and want in her voice. The virus hadn’t started changing her body yet but her mind was going full animal mode. Tim grinned as he moved forward and kissed his girlfriend, not knowing that act alone was enough to get the virus in him. <br />
<br />
Kim got to watch with a grin as black fur began to spread over Amy’s private areas as she began to change first because she had been infected a few moments before her lover. The black fur had darker spots as her jaguar fur pattern began to take over her lower areas. She could see brown fur, starting to grow on Tim’s lower body as well but still behind Amy’s.<br />
<br />
Kim moved over to still open window and gave a thumbs up, that was the sign for the lions to move in. With that done she moved to go join the fun. She put her hand on the bed causing it to go down and causing Amy and Tim to look at her, Tim’s eyes widened a bit as he saw the Jaguar women heading toward him, his mind not fully rewired by the virus. Amy however smiled showing new teeth even as her face began to change. <br />
<br />
“Care to share?” inquired Kim<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Answered Amy with a purr as Tim seamed to finally realize the changes already taking over. One could see the struggle on his face but also that his will to say no was losing…and why would he. What sort of male of his species would turn down two women of the same species willing to mate with him. He didn’t say yes, and he didn’t say now, either instead Kim moved to his front and placed his head on either side of her legs. With an open invite to her pussy and the scents coming from it, it was enough to make his will to say no break as he began to pleasure her down there. Meanwhile Kim and Amy leaned closer and touching their foreheads together began to kiss each other over Tim’s body. <br />
<br />
Amy’s hands began to run up and down Kim’s body feeling her 3 sets of breasts, two of them where mostly hidden under the fur but they were still very sensitive, and their touch caused her to moan. At the same time Kim was returning the favor feeling up her new mate even as pink flesh gave way to black fur and new breasts pushed out. Those breasts like her own would be used to feed their future children. Down below Tim was using his hands to pull Kim down to him while his new tail wrapped around Amy and did his best to pull her down deeper on him. <br />
<br />
Kim smiled as Amy finished transforming and moments later so did Tim, both let out a roar as they finished. Personally, Kim was not done herself, but the transformation made people finish sooner then their new form would do later. So she would buy her time, until later when real fun could begin. <br />
<br />
Multiple screams could be heard coming from down stairs, Jennifer and Stacy had likely just seen the lioness coming, little did they know they had a problem upstairs as well. <br />
<br />
“Looks like the lion pride I came with have arrive shall we join them?” inquired Kim to the newly transformed Jaguar people.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Purred Amy<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Roared Tim</p>
