<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The fat comment bothered me, fat can be sexy too. Some people might call me a ‘cubby chaser’ for such a thought. I love curves on a woman and, let’s face facts, those curves are made of fat. More fat means more curves. I have a magic ring that grants my every desire, might as well prove a point and fulfill my lusts. Samantha might even enjoy herself as well.<br />
<br />
“I wish Samantha was sexy fat.” I wished.<br />
<br />
I heard something smash against the floor in Samantha’s apartment. I went into the apartment to see if something was wrong. As I entered I saw Samantha holding onto a table for balance, a mug shattered on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Samantha, are you okay?” I asked with concern.<br />
<br />
“I’m fine. I just feel... weird suddenly.” She replied woozily.<br />
<br />
A deep grumbled filled her body. They both watched as her body wobbled and began to change. Skin seemed to soften as blemishes disappeared. Cellulite melted away, turning the fat from cottage cheese into jelly. Her curves seemed to swell as everything became perky and firm. Her breasts and bottom lost their sag and became big, bouncy spheres. Rolls of belly fat melted into a round belly that made her look pregnant.<br />
<br />
Samantha almost lost her balance as her fat began to shift and slide. Her double chin melted away making her cherubic rather than bloated. A bit of fat left her arms, leaving them soft but not too thick. Her back and shoulder lost almost all their fat, showing some definition beneath a layer of soft flesh. Her big belly began to shrink. She now had a cute, little belly and love handles sticking out. Her calves thinned down, cankles disappearing to show dainty feet and ankles flaring into thick, round calf muscles to support her weight.<br />
<br />
But this weight wasn’t disappearing, it was moving and her fat had to go somewhere. Her breasts began to swell as they filled with her extra fat. Her breasts were already quite large and now blew up into huge heavy spheres. I couldn’t begin to guess what cup size they could possibly be, but I could see that Samantha now sported tits the size of basketballs. <br />
<br />
“Oh my god, these are huge.” Samantha moaned. She cradled her tits and began to bounce them in her arms. “What’s happening too me?”<br />
<br />
I was too busy drooling at the sight before me to give a reply. Samantha gasped and her hands flew to her sides as her fat marched south. I watched as her hands were pushed outwards as fat piled on to her widening hips. Thighs that were already touching crowded together as they thickened even more. Her pelvis popped and groaned as they spread further to carry their wide load. Samantha struggled to keep her balance as her feet moved further apart. Her hips pushed ever outward and her thighs eagerly filled up her fleeting thigh gap. <br />
<br />
“Oh, this too much, I’m too-woah.” She wobbled around as she struggled to walk. “Way too big.” <br />
<br />
I threatened to cream my pants as I watched Samantha struggle with her new proportions. She wasn’t any heavier, but now everything about her was wider, more extreme. Most of her fat was now in her tits and ass. She was now top and bottom heavy. Her feet were now as far apart as her shoulders and throwing off her balance. She had to swing her hips with every step, bouncing and shaking her ass for everyone. As her hips swayed and wobbled behind Samantha, her breasts gave her difficulty up front. Her oversized melons heaved and bounced uncontrollably as she moved, their heavy weight threatened to throw her around. <br />
<br />
As she waddled through her apartment, I finally got a chance to see her new ass and it was glorious. It was big before, but now it was easily the biggest part of her curves. Each cheek was now stuffed with enough fat to be the size of pumpkins. It jutted out a good foot behind her and you could balance a tea cup on it. They heaved up and down as she moved, bouncing off each other in an endless motion of soft flesh. Her enormous, round bubble butt was supported by thighs thicker than my torso. She would have to really spread her legs if she ever wanted to part those fat thunder thighs.<br />
<br />
Samantha made her way to the full length mirror she had. She let out an excited and terrified gasp when she saw her new, voluptuous form. Breasts larger than volleyballs hung from her chest, capped by nipples the size of D batteries. Despite their size and weight, they kept their perky, overfilled teardrop shapes. They proudly stood out a foot from her chest, blocking her view to anything but her own full bosom. Hiding below her breasts was a big round belly. It had shrunk into a cute potbelly the size of a watermelon, a cute hole poking out where the bellybutton was. Below her thick waist her width exploded outward. She had the widest hips I had ever seen, curving out with heavy flanks of fat. She was as wide as a door and she would fill any chair she sat on. Her round hips flowed into a pair of thick thighs that pushed her width even further. This wide figure tapered into toned calves and dainty feet.<br />
<br />
“I’m so bouncy. And round.” She pondered in a state of shock. “How did this happen?”</p>
