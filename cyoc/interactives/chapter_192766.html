<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric couldn&#39;t wait to show off his new and improved body in school tomorrow - he just needed to figure out which version would be the new him.  While he felt he was hot in either form, he figured people might be suspicious if he changed back and forth too quickly.  He decided he was going to stay looking like he was ready for a teenage bodybuilding competition.  He&#39;d seen plenty of kids in his class who didn&#39;t seem that fit or large when they walked down the halls at school but as soon as they started changing in the locker room there was actually some really muscular bodies hidden under those clothes.  Unlike the huge football players who really couldn&#39;t hide their huge guts and massive size.  Eric figured he could hide his new physique under large clothes when around his mother (at least for a while) and while he planned to wear form fitting clothes at school he could also tell his classmates he didn&#39;t develop muscles overnight, he been working at it and they just hadn&#39;t noticed until now.  <br />
<br />
Thinking about all of his muscles in tight clothes reminded Eric there was no way his new physique would fit into his old clothes.  He really hoped he could find some clothes that fit because he didn&#39;t want to shrink back down so he could go shopping for bigger clothes.  Eric knew he didn&#39;t want to give up this bigger body and started flexing his biceps just to prove his point.  As he was flexing he suddenly had a memory of his father coming home after a long day on the construction sight, flexing his arms, and saying &quot;My job gave me this great bod&quot;.  A construction worker and a scientist - no wonder his parents marriage didn&#39;t last.  Luckily his mother was too busy with her job and had boxed up her husband&#39;s clothes and put them in the basement, but had never gotten around to getting rid of them.  <br />
<br />
Eric headed down to the finished basement and began opening the boxes with his father&#39;s old clothes in them.  After some searching Eric found a pair of jeans that appeared to be practically new and just about the right size for his new legs.  Eric put the jeans on and took a look in a nearby mirror.  This was awesome - these jeans left nothing to the imagination - from his pumped up calves, to his massive quads, and especially his new muscular bubble butt.  Eric found a sweatshirt that was plenty big enough to wear around the house and fool his mother.  He figured she wouldn&#39;t notice larger legs in his pj bottoms, but she was likely to notice all his new muscles in any size t shirt, but a massive sweatshirt was just the thing to hide his new muscles.  But when Eric wasn&#39;t at home the t shirt would be the most important part of his outfit to show off his new and improved body.  Eric found a t shirt in the box, put in on and started checking himself out.  It clung to his massive pecs in all the right ways, and still managed to be tight around the waist to show off his abs, and the arms of the t shirt hung loosely around his massive guns.  No, no this would never do! The shirt needed to be tight around his biceps (maybe this t shirt was old and his father had somehow stretched the sleeves out).  He tried another shirt but had the same problem.  Maybe his father had larger arms then he remembered.  <br />
<br />
There was no way Eric was walking into school tomorrow unless every piece of clothing clung to his new muscles and left nothing to the imagination.  Suddenly Eric remembered he could change his physique by using the app on his phone.  Eric grabbed his Dad&#39;s old shirt and ran up to his bedroom where he had left his phone.  Once he was back in his room Eric put on the shirt before opening the app.  The first screen that he saw was titled &quot;Nearby Rings&quot;, and he saw a figure with the words &quot;Eric - Subject # 32&quot; over it.  Realizing it had to be him, Eric clicked on the figure and he saw he had the option to click on the whole person or individual body parts.  Eric clicked on the figure&#39;s biceps.  After flexing and looking at his arms from various angles, Eric thought about two inches on his biceps should make the sleeves snug.  At the bottom of the screen was a gauge you could move to make your arms smaller or larger.  Eric moved the button two clicks to the left.  Eric suddenly felt a pressure in his arms and watched as his arms quickly grew one inch and then two.  Just like that the sleeves of the t shirt fit snugly against his biceps.  Eric flexed a few times really enjoying how the sleeves strained against his larger arms.  Eric was admiring his bigger arms when a thought occurred to him.  Before he could think about it further he pushed the button two clicks to the left and watched as the sleeves of the t shirt rode up as his biceps were now bigger then the sleeves.  Tomorrow at school was going to be fun!<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Eric couldn&#39;t get over what a difference a day could make.  Today had to be the best day of his life!  He didn&#39;t care how many times people came up to him and commented on how fit or hot he was, he just flexed his guns, or bounced his pecs and thanked them.  People who never even noticed him before suddenly were talking to him and were even interested in his weekend plans.  Everything was going great until some of the smaller athletes were complimenting Eric on his muscles and said they couldn&#39;t wait until that afternoon in gym class when they hoped they could get weightlifting advice from Eric.  <br />
<br />
Eric was trying not to panic - while he admired Jon and his physique for so long he didn&#39;t know the first thing about weightlifting or how much he was capable of lifting right now.  How could he get through gym class without embarrassing himself on his first day as a hot jock like Jon?  That&#39;s it - Jon was the answer!  Jon had a ring and Jon would understand how Eric could be so buff, but still not know the first thing about lifting.  <br />
<br />
Eric found Jon standing with his back to the lockers facing a bunch of students as he was recounting his latest triumph on the football field.  Eric waited until there was a break in the story, when he interrupted and said, &quot;Hey Jon, we have the same gym class after lunch, I was hoping I could lift with you and get some pointers?&quot; .  <br />
Jon looked at Eric and said, &quot;I&#39;ve already got some guys I lift with and your pretty buff anyways, maybe some other time&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Before Eric had a chance to say anything else Jon&#39;s admirers asked him to continue with his story.  Eric took a few steps back to think - he was getting desperate - what could he do to get Jon&#39;s help?<br />
<br />
Suddenly it came to Eric in a flash what he needed to do.  He knew if we made drastic changes to Jon&#39;s physique everyone would see it and Jon would never forgive him, but he needed to get Jon&#39;s attention.  Eric opened up the app and saw &quot;Eric - Subject # 32&quot; and &quot;Jon - Subject # 9&quot;.  Before he could talk himself out of it, Eric clicked on Jon&#39;s image, clicked on his glutes and slide the dial all the way down to zero.  Eric didn&#39;t know what was more impressive - how quickly Jon&#39;s glutes shrunk to nothing or how large his eyes got as he realized something was wrong.  Luckily with his back to the lockers no one had seen the change to his posterior.  Jon quickly finished is story and started looking around.  As Eric approached him his brushed the hair from his face with the finger he had the ring on, and he made sure Jon saw it.</p>
