<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Logan struggled against the intoxication induced lust, lifting his crumpled mass of a body with surprising ease out of its wildly uncomfortable looking position and taking it upstairs. He barely noticed how different his room felt from the new perspective. He would have preferred to simply attach his dad&#39;s head to his body and bring both up at once, however, attaching a head to a body without permission is just as wrong as detaching a head without permission and he&#39;s already in a position to get chastised, despite his pure intentions, and doesn&#39;t want to give his dad extra reason to be upset.<br />
<br />
Every third or so ungainly step causing him to stumble as his vision stopped behaving normally and he quickly began to feel nauseous. He gently placed his body onto his bed and went back for his dad&#39;s head. Grabbing it he went up to the master bedroom, but realized he couldn&#39;t swap his father back without his body present. &#39;Ugh, I planned this out wrong!&#39; <br />
<br />
Trying to move his body again in his now wildly intoxicated state was a bad idea, just the thought of it... Logan&#39;s stomach lurched. He bolted to the master bathroom and got to the toilet heaving up a dark frothy liquid, his fathers body involuntarily contracting repeatedly, leaving him crying with his mouth and sinuses burning and an awful taste in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Not that Logan knew this, but muscle memory now literally resides in the muscles, and as he collected himself, his fathers body instinctively grabbed for the toothpaste and toothbrush, and toilet paper was used as Kleenex. He drank 3 glasses of water to help rinse things out of his throat, unaware how much that would help him later. By the time Logan was back at his father&#39;s bed he simply laid down and passed out immediately, too exhausted to do anything else.<br />
<br />
Logan awoke, a thick fog covering his mind and a soreness covering his body. He had to use the bathroom. The toilet vaguely registered as much smaller than it should be, but his thoughts were cut short as his intestines violently revolted, cramped, and purged evil painfully. He shakily used toilet paper until he felt clean again, traumatized by the experience.<br />
<br />
Stepping back into the bedroom he saw his father&#39;s head and things came back to him... He prepared to pull off his head and walked over to his dad, but paused... if he swapped his head back in his sleep and left his body here, it would look like he was trying to hide what he did. The sink is wet, the room smells of the evil he expelled... with a sigh Logan decided to wait until his dad wakes up and then explain everything.<br />
<br />
Logan tried to wake his father, first by calling him, then by poking him, finally by flicking him, but his head was unresponsive. He didn&#39;t know that without being attached to a body that&#39;s filtering out the poison, his father&#39;s head is effectively trapped in the &quot;passed out drunk&quot; state from last night that Logan found him in. Expecting his father to regain consciousness shortly, he took Seth&#39;s head downstairs on a pillow and began trying to figure out breakfast.<br />
<br />
Muscle memory and a little mental power went a long way toward figuring out how to brew the coffee for his dad and make some eggs. He set the table for two and dished out a plate, poured a cup of coffee and tried to wake his father again. No luck, and he wasn&#39;t particularly quiet while cooking either. Wanting to hold off so they can eat together he realized grabbing the mail was a ritual his dad did in the morning and would give his dad a couple more minutes...<br />
<br />
Stepping outside he took a look around and took a deep breath, enjoying the morning he paused. His father&#39;s body pulled out a cigarette, popping it into Logan&#39;s mouth, lit it, and inhaled following the ritual it had been doing for the last 25+ years. Logan, shocked, opened his mouth dropping the cigarette to the ground, and just as quickly bending over to pick it up.<br />
<br />
He stared at it for a minute shocked, technically, legal age is based on body age, and his body is that of his 40 something year old father, so being hung over, drinking more, smoking, gambling or even having sex aren&#39;t illegal for him. He decided to let the body hold the cigarette,  reasoning that having it lit might keep him from wasting another, having heard how powerful muscle memory and habits can be.<br />
<br />
He made his way to the mailbox and pulled the mass of junk mail and letters out, unconsciously holding the cigarette in his mouth while he separated junk mail and mail with his or his fathers names actually on it. Household, the blah blah residence or family, or the worst offenders, our neighbors at... all just junk mail...<br />
<br />
He dropped it all in the recycling, mildly irritated at the wasted trip. He took a deep breath and exhaled, seeing a cloud of smoke. To his surprise the cigarette that was supposed to be in his rough and calloused had somehow made it to his clean and innocent mouth! He moved his hand to remove it, unintentionally pausing as his body instinctively took another deep drag out of habit. &quot;Fucking hell dad, no wonder you can&#39;t quit.&quot; He muttered exhaling another cloud of smoke.<br />
<br />
Recalling his dad is currently just a disembodied head and will undoubtedly panic when he awakens, he went to head inside, stopped again by his father&#39;s body hesitating, the last millimeters of the lit cigarette mocking him. His father never smokes inside, some reasoning strong enough to translate to muscle memory. Logan flattered himself entertaining the hope that maybe the reason was keeping his son away from second hand smoke, but the multitude of things that could or would make him resist smoking, why would that be the line in the sand?<br />
<br />
Frustrated and confused, unused to dealing with foreign habits, limits, and desires, he stepped back taking a final drag, and threw the butt away entering the house, sending his final smokey exhale out the door as he shut it. Dealing with other people&#39;s bodies is complicated. The smell of breakfast was heavy in the air.<br />
<br />
Repeated attempts to wake his father failed and unbeknownst to Logan, the lingering awful feeling wasn&#39;t simply his father&#39;s body being older or foreign, it was the remaining hangover from what passed his stomach before he purged. Reluctantly beginning breakfast alone with his father&#39;s head on a pillow before him, he devoured breakfast unprepared for an adult&#39;s post purge appetite. The 7 eggs he prepared for the both of them, were rapidly devoured by his father&#39;s body alone, and the coffee he made for his father was instinctively consumed along with it.<br />
<br />
Logan cleaned up from breakfast, and checked the clock, it was only 8:30 so he wasn&#39;t too worried that his father was &quot;sleeping in&quot; though was less than ecstatic that he couldn&#39;t wake him. He knew heads could survive for years apart from bodies and his body wasn&#39;t injured or anything before separation, so he was fine and will wake up soon. (Logan reasoned)<br />
<br />
Logan considered what he should do next and the answer was obvious, his father&#39;s body was wearing last night&#39;s clothes, hadn&#39;t bathed and well smelled a bit like the bar he crawled out of. Transporting Seth&#39;s head back to the master bedroom Logan undressed, bathed, and reclothed himself finally coming to the last steps in hygeine facial and oral... Logan could take care of his own needs, no problem, but his dad didn&#39;t brush his teeth last night, his hair is unwashed, he needs a shave...<br />
<br />
Trying to wake him again was pointless, but didn&#39;t stop Logan from trying. Running water in the sink he carefully washed his dad&#39;s hair, brushed his teeth, and rinsed his mouth out with mouthwash. None of it woke him or caused even a flicker of alertness. &quot;Jesus dad.&quot; Logan muttered resting his father&#39;s head back on the bed. It was now past 9am, and Logan was beginning to worry but also trying to stop himself. He rested on the bed as well, unaware that he quickly fell back asleep due to the large meal and his dad&#39;s lingering hangover.</p>
