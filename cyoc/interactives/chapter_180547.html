<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hi everyone :) This string of chapters is based on two ideas that were sent to me, both rolled into one. Hope you like it!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky grunted from the exertion as she placed a pair of small fish tanks on the table in front of you. At first glance, each of them contained three long, slender black fish; all of whom were busy swimming around in what was presumably fear.<br />
<br />
Sadly, Vicky wasn’t dissuaded as she next brought forward a bucket filled with a tiny bit of water. She set this down on the table beside the fish tanks, before she turned to explain who you were now looking at.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t they fascinating?” Vicky said as she excitedly watched the fish swimming around inside their tanks, “on the left we have the lungfish; a fascinating species capable of breathing both in and out of water. While over here, these three slippery eels are also able to survive outside their tanks for hours; a trait which makes them incredibly… ‘versatile’ animals.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you slightly uneasy as you dreaded to imagine the cruel and humiliating ways in which Vicky used these poor creatures’ biology against them. You had already seen so much that anything was possible at this point.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts were eventually distracted when Vicky said: “now then Princess, I want you to meet Emma and Leia… aren’t they a sweet couple?”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she simultaneously reached a hand into each fish tank and quickly grabbed one of the residents from each. Both terrified fish squirmed desperately to get away as Vicky lifted them out of the water and brought them over to you. Based on Vicky’s gestures, Emma was the eel in front of you, while Leia was a lungfish. Worryingly, you immediately detected the familiar signs of human intelligence in both of the creatures’ beady eyes. Clearly, Vicky had something planned for the two of them; and sadly you already knew that it wouldn’t be anything good. <br />
<br />
“Oh stop making such a fuss,” Vicky said as she tightened her grip on the two squirming fish in her hands, “haven’t you learnt by now that compliance is the best course of action. Of course, if you don’t behave yourselves then I might have to punish your entire family… surely you don’t want a repeat of last time?”<br />
<br />
Vicky’s words hung heavily in the air as the two fish looked at each other with a frantic expression. However, the cruel woman’s various threats seemed to be very convincing, as the lungfish and eel quickly settled down and went limp in her hands.<br />
<br />
“That’s better,” Vicky said with a smile, “now Princess, I suppose I had better explain what Emma and Leia are doing here. Well, in their past lives these two cuties used to be husband and wife, but since then their marriage has had quite a radical shakeup. I suppose that they are now a cross-species lesbian couple, given that Leia has completely abandoned her old masculine ways.”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this, you noticed the lungfish in her left hand give a slight grimace of what looked like anger. Clearly it was painful for the former-man to be reminded of what ‘she’ had lost; something which you could relate to whole-heartedly.<br />
<br />
This grim reality clouded your thoughts for a moment, until Vicky’s voice knocked you back to reality. “So,” Vicky said eagerly, “I bet you’re wondering how these two sweeties wound up as part of the Collection. Well, back when they were human they were responsible for a terrible accident; one which we couldn’t let them get away with. You see, Leia and Emma’s family hosted a fancy cocktail party at Leia’s parents’ grand stately home. Of course, upper-class snobs of their calibre think that they can do as they please, believing themselves to be above the law. Well, on this fateful evening, this convinced this foolish couple that it would be perfectly safe to drive the short distance home. Sadly, they instead ended up crashing into daddy’s horsebox, causing him to be admitted to hospital for months, while the prized broodmare he was transporting never made it…”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this her voice cracked slightly. You were surprised to see this typically lighthearted and cruel woman show such emotion. Worryingly though, you suspected that this sadness would end up turning into anger against her victims. As a result, you just kept your mouth shut and tried to behave; not wanting to set something off in the unstable woman.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky continued, “I suppose you might expect that our drunk drivers did the right thing and admitted that they were at fault? Not a chance. Instead, they tried to pin the accident on us and threatened to take us to court. Knowing how wealthy this stuck-up family was, we knew we could never get justice through conventional means. That is why we decided to take matters into our own hands…”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she moved back towards the two small fish tanks, making sure to hold the two fish up so that they could see inside. “Are you starting to miss your parents already?” Vicky said as she watched the eel staring sadly into the tank in front of her. “Don’t worry dear, I’m sure they would be happy to breed with you again once you are ready to spawn, the same goes for you Leia; I bet you can’t wait to provide more grandchildren for mummy and daddy!”<br />
<br />
Despite trying hard to keep your composure, hearing this made you give a short, shrill whinny of shock. Unless you were missing something, Emma and Leia were both housed and mated with their own transformed parents!<br />
<br />
“That’s right Princess,” Vicky continued in an angrier tone than before, “we made sure that every member of this fucking family got what they deserved. In fact I think I’ll show you the rest of them; then perhaps Leia and Emma can demonstrate just how close they all still are?”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky pulled the eel and lungfish back away from their new homes before she placed them inside the bucket on the table. “This should keep these two nice and moist. Now then,” she said looking down at the two fish, “I think we ought to pay your siblings a visit. How does that sound?”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made Emma and Leia visibly nervous as they looked up at Vicky pleadingly. Sadly though, the sadistic woman was not the least bit phased as she simply said “excellent” in reply. <br />
<br />
Following this, Vicky went back over to the stacks of animal-filled containers against the wall, before she returned with two cages. Both cages contained members of the same weasel-like species, which you recognised as pine martens. In one cage, a lone male sat looking around nervously, while in the other, a pair of females lay huddled together, with their heads buried into their furry bodies.<br />
<br />
“Here they all are,” Vicky announced as she placed the pine martens down near the two fish tanks, “what a nice big family reunion we have here. Leia, your two brothers look like they are adapting well to life as female animals. I’m sure you and your parents are just as proud as I am…”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she made sure to push the cage up against the lungfish tank, allowing Leia’s parents to see what had happened to their two eldest sons.<br />
<br />
“And as for this little fella,” Vicky said as she motioned to the male pine marten in the other cage, “he seems to have grown fond of his new sisters-in-law over the weeks he has been near them. That’s right Emma, I’ve seen your former-sister eyeing up his future mates, no doubt eager to put that new set of cock and balls of his to good use!”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, the male pine marten let out a deep growl of anger as he did his best to sound threatening. However, Vicky simply laughed as she casually maneuvered his cage so that his two eel parents could get a better look at what had become of their beloved daughter.<br />
<br />
After letting the pine martens reunite with their parents for a moment, Vicky seemed eager to proceed as she moved back over to the bucket where Emma and Leia were still contained. “Okay you two, I think it’s time to show Princess what good, obedient pets you now are. I think we’ll begin with Leia’s two sisters, after all; they both look like they are in dire need of cheering up…”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky suddenly opened the female pine martens’ cage before scooping out one of the terrified occupants. Then, Vicky used her other hand to pluck Leia out of the bucket, before bringing her closer to her transformed sibling.<br />
<br />
“Now then you two,” Vicky said with a sinister grin, “it’s been so long since you last saw each other. Luckily, I think I know how to demonstrate how strong the bond between sisters is. Here, this should bring you both up to speed…”<br />
<br />
With no more warning than that, Vicky suddenly moved Leia even closer to the female pine marten in her other hand. However, you immediately started to feel sick inside when you saw Vicky aiming the lungfish towards the lower portion of the marten’s body. Then, with no further ceremony, Vicky casually pushed Leia down between her former-brother’s legs, before she brought the lungfish’s slimy snout into contact with the tight pink slit which adorned the pine marten’s crotch! <br />
<br />
This unforeseen act elicited a short, raspy cry of surprise from the shocked pine marten as she felt her transformed brother’s snout kissing her exposed feminine sex. She tried desperately to break free of Vicky’s grip, probably out of embarrassment more than anything. <br />
<br />
Sadly though, Vicky was far too strong and experienced to let either animal go. Instead, she started to increase the pressure against the pine marten’s sex as she actively started to push the startled lungfish inwards. <br />
<br />
As she did this, Vicky briefly looked at you and gave you a cheeky wink. Then, with a firm shove, Vicky pushed hard with the frantically-squirming lungfish; causing the fish’s entire head to suddenly force its way into the tight space beyond the pine marten’s outer vaginal walls.<br />
<br />
With Leia now in position, Vicky started to slowly thrust her slippery body in and out of the tender vaginal folds surrounding her, causing the pine marten to moan in a mix of denial and unwanted bliss as her most sensitive areas were stretched and teased to an extremely pleasurable degree.<br />
<br />
With her sick performance now well underway, Vicky looked back to you with another excited grin on her face. Clearly, she was revelling in the humiliation and suffering she was inflicting; and this made you suspect that there was still much more in store for this unfortunate family going forward…</p>
