<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;What did he change?&#39; Drake tried his best to figure out what about his life could be different from just a few moments ago. He knew the magic lamp was powerful, but the abject confusion and inability to feel as though anything were off made it all the more terrifying. After watching Alan grow in front of him but not notice it in the slightest, he knew that any changes to him would be exactly the same. Drake just didn&#39;t realize how frustrating it would be.<br />
<br />
Drake ran through different scenarios. There had to be something about him. He knew Alan really liked size difference. Had Alan made him smaller? But then Zack was so big. Alan never really talked about talked positively about Zack. Then again, was there something something else that had changed?<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong babe?&quot; Zack&#39;s deep voice whispered into Drake&#39;s ear. His bearded face gently tickled Drake&#39;s sensitive neck.<br />
<br />
For a moment Drake didn&#39;t know where he was. He was still in class, but now was on Zack&#39;s lap. The two had always shared a desk. Ever since they started dating it seemed unnecessary for him to have his own. Drake looked back at Alan, still smile in a strangely devilish way. &quot;Can we--&quot; Drake grunted as he felt Zack&#39;s hand run down his thin arm and into his shorts. The thick hand gently laid on top of his cock. &quot;Can we go to the bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course babe,&quot; Zack said. &quot;Anything for you...&quot; Within a moment Drake felt his little body lifted into the air as though he were nothing more than a back pack. Zack cradled him in his strong arms and carried him to the bathroom. &quot;That class was getting pretty boring...&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake couldn&#39;t help but agree as he felt the kisses from Zack start to lower down on his body. Those huge football player hands had made their way underneath his shirt and gently tickled the soft skin underneath. Before Drake knew it, Zack was already removing Drake&#39;s shirt completely and gently continuing the bearded onslaught of kisses against his exposed chest. &quot;Z-Zack?&quot; Drake stammered as he tried to stay on his original topic. &quot;Have you noticed anything change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change?&quot; Zack asked between kisses. They had slowly made their way down Drake&#39;s flat chest and onto his thin stomach. Drake squirmed under the ticklish feeling, gripping Zack&#39;s broad shoulders as he tried his best to stay focused. &quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the problem... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Drake answered. Zack&#39;s hands had dropped Drake&#39;s shorts around his ankles. The huge cock was already having trouble staying in their confines. &quot;Like Alan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alan?&quot; Zack paused for a second. &quot;Don&#39;t talk about him...&quot; he grumbled for a moment. &quot;That loser&#39;s a huge fucking turn off...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is my best friend you know,&quot; Drake grumbled back. Zack didn&#39;t respond. He simple engorged the massive rod into his mouth as though to not say something else. Drake&#39;s hands gripped tightly against the football player&#39;s broad shoulders as his head shot back. His breathing went shallow as he tried to contain himself. It didn&#39;t matter how many times he&#39;d cum during the day, Zack could always squeeze another one or two out of him. The soft lips and gentle bristles of his ginger beard tickled Drake&#39;s cock in the most arousing ways. The only thing better would have been Zack&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck!&quot; Drake shouted as he gripped Zack&#39;s body with all his might. He couldn&#39;t stop himself as his cock throbbed and unloaded into the other man. &quot;Man you&#39;re good at that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack looked up at Drake. His fake lion ears had practically fallen off his head. He adjusted them with his lion paws from his fur suit. As he spun around to look in the mirror to make sure they were right, the long fake lion tail swung around him. &quot;I know,&quot; he said with confidence.<br />
<br />
Drake shook his head at the furry gear the other man was wearing. If he didn&#39;t find him so hot, he might have thought it were annoying. &quot;But, back to Alan. I think he&#39;s been changing things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Changing things?&quot; Zack looked confused.<br />
<br />
Drake understood why. However, he needed to confide in at least someone. &quot;Yeah. He&#39;s borrowed my magic lamp, and I think he&#39;s changing things about the world. Whenever he makes a wish the world changes so it&#39;s always been that way...&quot; Drake felt the insanity of the situation leaking out through him. &quot;You probably think I&#39;m crazy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Zack smiled and gave his boyfriend a kiss on the cheek. &quot;If anyone else said it, yeah. But I&#39;m always on your side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-really?&quot; Drake was surprised. <br />
<br />
However, he was interrupted by Alan opening the bathroom door. &quot;There you two--&quot; he cut himself off with laughter as he looked at Zack. &quot;Holy shit you really are a furry! Look at how stupid you look! Those stupid lion ears and that tail! Holy shit!&quot; his laughter only grew as looked up and down Zack&#39;s lion gear.<br />
<br />
Drake and Zack looked at each other in confusion. Zack had been wearing this stuff since the first day they&#39;d met. It&#39;d only made sense why Zack didn&#39;t like Alan all that much if he still found it so funny that Zack was obsessed with lions. &quot;Let&#39;s go get some lunch,&quot; Zack said, trying his best not to take the bait that Alan had laid out for him.</p>
