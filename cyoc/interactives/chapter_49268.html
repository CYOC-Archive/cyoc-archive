<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You're quitting?&quot; Glendale's police chief asked as Frank and Daryl reported their intentions to resign, shortly after returning to the station.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, sir, but some family trouble has come up that is very big,&quot; Frank spoke, &quot;I'm afraid I will have to leave to deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it the kids? Are they okay?&quot; the chief asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid that's personal, sir,&quot; Frank answered, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's your excuse?&quot; the chief asked, turning to Daryl.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's boredom, I guess, sir,&quot; Daryl answered, &quot;I know I came here to get out of the hectic pace the way crime was in the city, but Glendale is too quiet. I mean, this was our first real call in what seems like years, and all it was was two dogs humping. I didn't sign on for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Small towns are like that Daryl,&quot; the chief tried to persuade at least one officer to stay, &quot;We don't have in the way of crime because there simply aren't enough people for it to be apparent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's still boring me, sir,&quot; Daryl answered, &quot;I didn't come here for everything to be this quiet. I need to find some place that is a balance between here and the city I came here from. I'm sorry, but I can't take looking around at nothing anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clean out your desks and go,&quot; the chief gave a depressed sigh and turned away.<br />
<br />
Both Daryl and Frank then turned and walked away. Roughly five minutes later they both emerged from the station and began walking together to where Frank had parked his own vehicle, and old Ford Bronco.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should go together,&quot; Daryl offered, &quot;for support.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daryl wasn't quite sure where that had come from. Both of them had cell-phones to contact their families, and while neither of them wanted to go through with it, neither could they fight the effects of the &quot;curse&quot; they were under. And Daryl seemed to know it would be the hardest on Frank. Daryl had only his parents to call, and he actually saw them rarely as it was. Frank had a wife and children that would be angry and would surely miss him. Daryl wondered if some of the parts of their coming transformation were beginning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Frank nodded, and pulled out his cell-phone.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Frank heard his home phone ringing on the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; his wife's voice spoke through the cell-phone's ear piece.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Julie, it's me,&quot; Frank spoke slowly...<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank! What a lovely surprise,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;I rarely hear from you while you're at work... girls, it's you're daddy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank then overheard the chorus of his children saying &quot;hello&quot; in the background. It made his heart break.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie... I... I have some tough news for you to take,&quot; Frank said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it? You know you can tell me anything,&quot; Julie told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something's come up at work,&quot; Frank spoke, &quot;apparently the FBI got a hold of my previous police records... and well, they want me to Iraq to help train police units for some of their smaller villages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you turned it down,&quot; Julie spoke firmly, &quot;We only just moved here, and I'm not moving our daughters to Iraq.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried,&quot; Frank managed to speak, &quot;Honestly I did, but they wouldn't take no for an answer. They expect me to be there tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe this,&quot; Julie gasped, &quot;They can't do that to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried, honey,&quot; Frank spoke, &quot;Really I did. The only &quot;good&quot; news out of all of this is that they actually didn't want you or our children to come along. Something about it being too dangerous... although, it's also made me nervous... Julie... something is telling me that I won't make it back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DON'T SAY THAT!&quot; Julie screamed back at him, &quot;Everything will be fine. Come home. I'll make some calls and get to the bottom of this. You'll stay here, where you'll be safe...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank could hear his wife sobbing through the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Julie,&quot; Frank spoke, and hung up.<br />
<br />
As he did so, he glanced over to Daryl, who had while they'd been driving turned into his own identical twin. Fairly athletic looking, dirty blond, but graying, hair. Frank only sighed again the changes were already beginning. He felt uncomfortable, both at the skin level and inside himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, Frank,&quot; Daryl spoke in a voice that sounded almost identical to Frank's, although it sounded like it was becoming higher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Frank muttered.<br />
<br />
He drove slowly, trying to avoid drawing attention, and to allow him to relieve some of the discomfort he felt in his hips and shoulders. Frank also found that he itched all over. As he turned to round a supermarket he looked down to see why he was itching. Dirty blond fur was growing all along his arms and hands, which were now tipped with long claw-like nails.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's starting,&quot; Daryl gasped, &quot;we're... my clothes are getting tight...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank glanced over to see that Daryl was starting to grow in overall size and that his shoulders were starting to narrow while his hips widened and his hair crew longer. Dirty blond fur was also starting to appear on his face. Frank tried to shudder as he knew the same thing was happening to him, but a strange tingle in his mind prevented him from doing so.<br />
<br />
They kept going at a slow pace back toward the Perkin's house, with buttons popping and seems ripping as their bodies continued to form a more lupine-like, and increasingly feminine shape. Frank was forced to stop, however at one corner when he felt incredible pain in his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrggh,&quot; Frank groaned, sounding more like a woman then he had before, &quot;I gotta get these shoes off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Daryl agreed.<br />
<br />
Frank shuffled around in the seat to take off his shoes, and as he did so, he watched them lengthen into wolf-like paws, covered in dirty blond fur. Frank managed to get his longer feet down, only to feel some pain at the base of his spine. Something was growing there, with the rest of his body growing bigger, and his hips widening, it was somewhat painful as his clothing began to restrict him.<br />
<br />
Frank gave a pained groan and began attacking his pants with his clawed hands. He had to relieve the pressure there, as the leather belt wouldn't give, and his widening hips hadn't ripped the back seem of his pants yet. What resulted was a series of loud ripping noises as he ended up ripping his pants and his belt to shreds with his claws, leaving him naked from the waist down.<br />
<br />
Looking down, in fear, Frank saw what she had been fearing. The penis she had had before was gone, replaced by a woman's reproductive organs. She also noticed that what had been growing out of her spine was a tail, covered in dirty blond fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm female,&quot; Frank groaned, half way sounding frightened and half way sounding relieved, and began to feel some weight on her chest as her shirt tightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; came Daryl's voice, sounding equally feminine.<br />
<br />
Frank looked over to Daryl and watched as Daryl's growing breasts popped the last buttons on her shirt an began to approach the size of the she-wolf that had transformed them. Frank found herself smiling as her own breasts did the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will the master like the new us?&quot; Frank slowly asked as she felt her face begin to push forward into a muzzle, &quot;Darla?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so, Fran,&quot; the newly renamed Darla answered, &quot;I really hope so.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jensen paced nervously through the living room of Kaylee's home. True, Kaylee had tried to help by giving him a pack to command, but he had preferred that Kaylee had waited. From what his mate had told him, she had left what could be potential holes in her plan. If they went to their family... it could run as far as driving across the country to inform distant relatives that they were traveling. He hoped that Kaylee's use of the &quot;transform or dare&quot; power left them with enough willpower to use a cell-phone and come up with a believable story for both their bosses at the police station and for their families.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be fine,&quot; Kaylee urged, &quot;I made sure that they would return, and wouldn't use the transform or dare power until you commanded them to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had better hope so,&quot; Jensen growled, &quot;and you had better hope that they return before your parents do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely we could delay my folks long enough for your new pack members to arrive,&quot; Kaylee spoke,&quot;and we are stronger then they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but the last thing we need is a fight that will attract more attention then what our mating attracted,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;the police could send more officers...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen stopped when he heard a noise outside on the driveway. He turned an ear to hear it more clearly. Some vehicle had just parked there.</p>
