<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to transform the man with the Book of Beast. It's better than killing him, and if you pick a smaller animal, he should be incapable of putting up to much of a fight.<br />
<br />
You pull out the Book of Beast, point at the man, and use Beast Shape spell. In a cloud of smoke, the man is replaced by rabbit. That should be relatively harmless.<br />
<br />
Then, you pick up the book the man had dropped when you first kicked him.<br />

The Book of Transmutation<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You now have the Book of Transmutation, which is now the fourth book in your collection. There are only three more to go. And Ruby has two of them. You think about asking her for the books, then, the books you have begin to glow.<br />
<br />
All the books fly out of your bag, and rotate in a circle around you. They glow, and flip to blank pages, as new words start to appear in each of the books.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Book of Time<br />
<br />

<br />
The books stop glowing and fall to the floor. You quickly gather them up and put them in your bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was, interesting.&quot; Ruby watches as you pick up the books. &quot;I suppose if I gave you my books, the same thing would happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.... Are you going to?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet.&quot; She replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means, you will eventually?&quot; You ask hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; She signs. &quot;Anyways, that's not what I came here for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you here?&quot; You ask. &quot;I got the letter, and explained what happened from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Well, I got a letter as well. It mostly just said something about having some book, the end of the world, joining an empire, and how powerful some guy is. I naturally came to kick his ass. Sending me spam like that....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me!&quot; John speaks up. &quot;Right, I know I only had one book, and don't even have that anymore. But, one I have no idea what you guys are going on about evil empires and traps, and two, isn't there still some big bad guy to get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right.&quot; You think maybe John isn't quite as stupid as he comes off. &quot;Alright, well, he can't see us now, which is why we're all still alive. However, we still don't know where in this mansion if anywhere he is. So... Lets see. We could split up, but we have no way of communicating with each other. Or, it could be safer to stay togethor, except then one trap could take us all out.&quot;</p>
