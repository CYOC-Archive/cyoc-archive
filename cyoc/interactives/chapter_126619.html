<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The alarm woke them both up the next morning. It was finally Friday. Again, neither moved except to turn off the alarm. Jeff&#39;s mom<br />
came into the room.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mom growled, &quot;You boys need to unplug and get going. And I mean now. You two are not moving.&quot; Then Jeff&#39;s mom stepped over<br />
to the side of the bed, and unplugged Jeff&#39;s vibrator. That was enough to spur Carlton to slowly withdraw from Jeff&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mom smiled, &quot;See you two tonight,&quot; and left, closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Slowly the two made their way out of the bed and standing. They cleaned up their mess on the bed and Jeff wiped down the vibrator.<br />
After a quick shower, the two were naked in Jeff&#39;s room picking out the other&#39;s clothes for that day. Jeff put on a black latex<br />
bodysuit while Carlton put on a red version of the same bodysuit. Carlton loved the fully zippered crotch. Then Jeff took one of<br />
the pills in his back pack. It was close to illegal for the school dress code, but they each wore a t-shirt over the top to comply<br />
with school rules.<br />
<br />
The two squeaked and rubbed all the way to school. Carlton enjoyed rubbing the crotch zipper into Jeff&#39;s pussy, giving him a huge<br />
camel toe. Carlton&#39;s cock was rock hard, and extended from his crotch to the near the top of his stomach, and was all concealed by<br />
the t shirt. The two ate lunch together, something they rarely do. Carlton was happy for the rest of the day. Jeff walked out to<br />
Carlton&#39;s car, and he was already inside it. Jeff got into the car, and saw Carlton&#39;s t shirt was off and his suit was mostly<br />
unzipped with the air conditioner running. Jeff smiled as he closed the door, &quot;I have no homework for the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlton was breathing deeply, &quot;So hot...how do you last so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and pulled up his shirt. His suit was unzipped down to his waist. &quot;I unzipped when I we got out of the car this<br />
morning. <br />
<br />
Carlton smiled, breathing heavily, and laughed, &quot;Yea...&quot;, Carlton chuckled, &quot;You don&#39;t have these babies on your chest. I think<br />
I will stick to breathable clothing for all day wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff reached up and gave one of Carlton&#39;s nipples a gentle squeeze, &quot;I like both of these.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Eventually, Carlton stopped sweating and swatted Jeff&#39;s hand from his nipple squeezing. Carlton put the car in gear and drove to<br />
Jeff&#39;s home. Jeff&#39;s parents were both home when Carlton pulled into the driveway. Jeff handed him his t shirt when he turned off<br />
the engine. They both got out, and adjusted themselves so they were presentable and went into the house together.<br />
<br />
The two dropped off their backpacks in Jeff&#39;s room and went to the living room. Jeff&#39;s mom smiled at the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your supper is in the refrigerator when you two are ready.&quot; said Jeff&#39;s Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mrs. Sims,&quot; offered Carlton.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s father stood up from the couch, and offered his hand to Jeff&#39;s mom, and they walked silently back to their bedroom, locking<br />
their bedroom door behind them.<br />
<br />
Jeff took off his t shirt, and Carlton did the same. Both had their bodysuits unzipped to their crotches.<br />
<br />
Carlton sat down on the couch, it was cool to the touch. Jeff slid off his bodysuit and went back to the bathroom to hang it up to<br />
dry. Jeff took a quick shower to rinse off his body and to rinse out the bodysuit. He quickly patted down with a towel and put the<br />
towel into the bodysuit to help it dry out.<br />
<br />
Carlton smiled when Jeff walked back into the room and sat down on the couch next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell clean,&quot; said Carlton who was gazing between Jeff&#39;s legs. &quot;No pills this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was gazing at Carlton&#39;s erect cock stretching up inside Carlton&#39;s bodysuit underneath his right nipple. Carlton relaxed and<br />
sunk back into the couch when Jeff reached into the right side of Jeff&#39;s suit and pulled his erect cock out. Jeff leaned over and<br />
slowly took the tip into his mouth, and began to suckle on the already salty glans. Jeff used his free hand to slide into the right<br />
side of Carlton&#39;s bodysuit, and located the rock hard nipple. Using both his mouth and nipple squeeze massage, Jeff worked eagerly<br />
to bring his friend to orgasm. Jeff would briefly pause or slow down when he could feel his friend tense up on the edge of orgasm,<br />
and would speed back up when Carlton relaxed. This went on for several minutes before Carlton growled deeply, &quot;You had your fun,<br />
now it&#39;s time to finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff did not hesitate when Carlton&#39;s body tensed again to push him over the edge and kept a vacuum seal on his friends erupting<br />
cock, swallowing and milking the tip, completely draining his friend. Carlton collapsed on the couch, his body spasming in orgasm.<br />
Carlton was asleep when Jeff replaced the mostly rigid, but softening cock back into the bodysuit. Jeff went to the kitchen, and<br />
brought back two large glasses of ice water. Carlton opened his eyes when Jeff took an ice cube to his right nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that felt good?,&quot; asked Jeff as he reached out the glass of water for Carlton to take.<br />
<br />
Carlton took the glass and consumed nearly half the glass before nodding. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Carlton, seemingly out of breath.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave Carlton his nearly full glass, and took the half empty one back to the kitchen to refill.<br />
<br />
Carlton was standing up in front of the couch when Jeff returned. Carlton smiled, &quot;I love this suit.&quot; Carlton finished his glass<br />
and took the full one from Jeff. Carlton followed Jeff back into the kitchen. Carlton slowly drank several more glasses of water<br />
before putting the glass in the sink.<br />
<br />
Jeff was stroking Carlton&#39;s butt through the latex and asked, &quot;If you could change anything about your body or mine, what would it<br />
be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlton asked, &quot;What with surgery or just what if kind of thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff answered, &quot;The what if kind, like magic.&quot;</p>
