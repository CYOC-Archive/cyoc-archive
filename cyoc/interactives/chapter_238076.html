<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luis&#39; session of self-admiration was put on hold when he heard a soft clicking sound. It was probably the noise of Lilianne&#39;s heels softly clicking as she walked along the title of her spa. Good, Luis wanted to talk to Lilianne again. Not only to thank her again for all she&#39;s done for him but maybe, just maybe, flirt with her a bit? He turns to her and gives her his best attempt of a sexy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, hey, Ms. Walker. Just got out of the sauna, and I can&#39;t believe the rumors were actually true. It really does make you hotter and sexier. Though, I can&#39;t believe it made me this sexy!&quot; Luis does an amateur flex to show what he means. &quot;I really have to thank you, Ms. Walker. Not just for letting me use the sauna but also for healing my sprain. It really means a lot to me that you took the time to do this for someone like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aww, that was sweet, Lilianne thought. Honestly, even Lilianne was shocked at how attractive Luis had become. A real Latin stud, a heartthrob that had just walked off the set of a steamy scene. Combine that hot body with a bad boy-like attitude but a truly sincere heart underneath, and any man or woman would love to have him. Which made him a perfect fit for some of her plans. Lilianne handed Luis a pair of workout shorts she had prepared for earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to agree. You are certainly much more attractive, Luis. You far exceeded my expectations.&quot; Lilianne leaned in and used a finger to trace Luis&#39; jawline. Then, she slowly made her way down Luis&#39; neck and stopped at his collarbone. An action that caused Luis to shiver and want more. However, that desire was left unfulfilled when he saw Lilianne turn away. &quot;Now, I&#39;m sure you want to test out your new muscles. Meet me at the workout area after you change. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to exercise in your underwear, especially how tight they currently are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luis looked down and noticed that his underwear was barely holding on. Most of his clothes probably didn&#39;t fit his new buff bod. He probably also didn&#39;t have enough money to buy new clothes. Looks like he would have to figure out how to get a new wardrobe, but that was something to figure out for later. Right now, he was just happy he had gotten free shorts.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Dig deep and push through the pain, Luis! Show me that you want this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilianne watched as Clyde acted as Luis&#39; personal trainer. Because she was dabbling with the idea of expanding the workout area into a proper gym, the spa owner had given Clyde knowledge about personal training. She thought of this as a bit of a test run, and while he was training Luis well, it seemed like Clyde would occasionally repeat himself. Luis,  inexperienced at lifting weights, didn&#39;t seem to have noticed, but he probably would have if he trained with more Clyde over time. Looks like a kink she would have to work out later. Oh well, at least the view of two muscular men working out together was quite nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;One more rep, Luis! Finish strong! You got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luis groaned as he finished his last rep on the machine. The workout area in the wellness center may not have been a spa, but it was still equipped enough to allow Luis to test his strength. It felt so fucking good being this strong! Luis was pushing the limits of some of the machines, and he felt like he could have gone even further in a proper gym. In fact, the Latino stud felt like he could take on both the Vipers and the Bulls at the same time. Granted, that probably was the adrenaline talking, but he didn&#39;t care. With this new bod, he could take on the world. Luis got up from the machine, his shirtless body glistening with sweat as he gave Cylde a &quot;Bro handshake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew, thanks for pushing me, dude. We should do that again sometimes.&quot; Luis hoped that Clyde would say yes, but Clyde was interrupted by clapping from Lilianne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, Mr. Sanchez. That was an impressive show of strength.&quot; Luis rubbed the back of his neck while blushing and thanked her. &quot;Now, I do have a proposition for you. You see, my business here was hit pretty hard during the lockdown, and I&#39;ve been thinking of ways to revitalize this place. Then I met you, and I think you would be a great help in making those ideas realities. What I&#39;m saying is, would you like a job here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luis eye&#39;s started to mist over as he heard the word job. Was this real? Was he really just offered a job in a nice place like this? Luis wanted to cry, but he couldn&#39;t cry in front of Lilianne, so he somehow managed to calm himself down. <br />
<br />
&quot;A-are you sure? I mean, yes, I will! I accept! So, what do you want me to do? Be a model for a poster or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
A model for posters, huh? Considering how handsome Luis was now, it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea. Something to look into later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps if I find a good photographer, you could model for me. However, even if I don&#39;t find one, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be a great employee and will help me revitalize this place. Now, I do need time to finalize my plans, but I will say that it will involve you contacting your gang friends. Is that okay with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luis looked down in shame. Well, if he was going to work for her, he probably should tell Lilianne the truth. He mustered up his courage before he looked the owner straight in the eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can talk to them, but if you want me to join them officially, well, I rather not. You see... I only wanted to join the Vipers to protect my younger brother and the rest of my family. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I mean what I said to you before. If any of the Bulls show up, I&#39;ll protect this place. I don&#39;t let anyone push around me or the people I care about. I just don&#39;t want to be hurting innocent, you know? So...&quot;<br />
<br />
To Luis&#39;s surprise, Lilianne just smiled like she knew all along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I figure something like that was the case. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t make you do anything that you&#39;re not comfortable with. So, now that that&#39;s taken care of, I have a lot of explaining to do. About who I am and about the secrets of this place... but we can save that for later. Why don&#39;t we celebrate having a new employee around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilianne leaned in once again and touched Luis&#39; collarbone. The place where she left off before and slid her finger down between the middle of his pecs. Once again, Luis shuttered in anticipation. Did, did Lilianne mean what he thought she meant? O..oh my! She was quite forward, wasn&#39;t she? Luis thought to say something but panicked and blurted out the first thing that came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-we? You mean? Clyde, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilianne didn&#39;t mean to include Clyde, but it seems like Luis wanted to. Ha! She knew there Luis&#39; stares weren&#39;t 100% platonic. Lilianne glances at Clyde before returning her attention to Luis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You want to include Clyde, too? I don&#39;t mind. Now, I can see your apprehension but think of this as a chance to explore yourself more. Plus, don&#39;t worry, everything that happens here will say here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luis looked at Lilianne and then turned to Clyde. He did have to admit there was something about Clyde that drew Luis in. Maybe, just maybe now was a good time to explore his desires more. He turned back to Lilianne and answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay. I&#39;d like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
Luis was sat on a bed in a private room. Before him was Clyde stripping off his clothes. To Luis&#39; left was Lilianne, sitting on an armchair and just observing the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey? Are you not joining us?&quot; Luis asked trying to talk to his new boss while staring at Clyde.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;m just giving you two space while Clyde teaches you. I think you want a little bit of experience before you enter your first threesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teach? Luis thought before he noticed that Clyde had gotten a lot closer than while he was listening to Lilianne. He gulped at how Clyde loomed over him while having that hungry gaze in his eyes. Clyde was staring, and Luis like he was some prey for him to eat. Suddenly, Clyde steps forward and catches Luis&#39; lips in a searing hot kiss. Luis wasn&#39;t expecting this to all start so soon, but he quickly found himself melting into the kiss, trying to kiss back with as much passion. Eventually, the two broke the kiss leaving Luis panting. Yet, he still couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off of Cylde as he began to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are so handsome, you know that? A good-looking face with a rocking bod. I want to explore you, worship every inch of you, and ruin you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde then started to kiss Luis&#39; neck while his hand roamed every inch of Luis&#39; body, feeling every curve and finding all of Luis&#39; sensitive spots. Luis was starting to feel like putty, as he was like putty in Clyde&#39;s hands. Lilianne watched the scene with delight. Clyde was doing quite well despite having a trashy romance novel vibe right now. However, it seems like Luis was enjoying this a lot. Lilianne started to touch herself as she observed the new man and the homunculus started having sex right in front of her.</p>
