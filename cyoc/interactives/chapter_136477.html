<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey did you guys see what happened in the hallway!?” Said a kid sitting near Greg, <br />
“No, what happened,” another responded,<br />
“Well is wasn’t there but I heard that Chad Birmiling and Kylie Parins changed genders and then became huge nerds, or looked like huge nerds, I think..” they kept talking the entire journey, this annoyed Greg so he made them all them stop talking. Their faces all puffed up like they were having an allergic reaction to something, making it impossible for them speak. Their cheeks were all puffed up and their mouthes had only enough room to breathe air through. The bus finally turned up at Greg’s house, he got off and as it was leaving he flipped it off (with his middle finger). He walked to his house and looked for his keys, then remembered that he had ‘do whatever I want’ powers so he opened it easily. He walked in to find his father sitting on the sofa watching a baseball game, his mother cleaning the dishes, his 6 year old brother doodling on a piece of paper, his 9 year old sister playing with toys, and his 13 year old sister listening to music in her room. His father had accumulated a large belly over the recent years and did nothing about it, Greg had even offered if he wanted to go to the gym with him. His mother worked non-stop, she had no job and relied on her husband to get all the money, she had to trust that Greg could work his Saturday job to get some money to feed all 6 people.<br />
<br />
Greg had to go through his sister’s (the 13 year old) room to get to his, he walked in without knocking and found her sitting with her legs crossed on her bed with her smartphone plugged in with headphones and listening to some rock band. Surprisingly Greg and Stephanie (his sisters name) liked the same music, but never knew because they’d always fight over one thing or another. <br />
<br />
They had an ongoing rivalry and didn’t like each other one bit. When Greg walked into her room to get to his, they barely made eye contact, now that he had the power to do anything, he could annoy her to the maximum. He decided he’d do what he did to Kylie. Her small but present breasts shrunk away and she didn’t even notice, or care, she continued to listen to her music. Greg to took it to another level, quite extreme compared to the last. Her hands started to feel weird but she just assumed it was a bug or something so she didn’t look, but then they felt heavier, she opened to peek and saw that her hands had doubled in size and a bit more. Her face was horrified as she tried to open the door to leave but couldn’t get a grip on the handle. Before she could figure out how to fix it or handle it, her arms started to bulge out with muscle, she now had huge muscle arms and giant hands. Her legs grew shorter and stumper on her body, her stomach got fatter slightly and poured out of her top, she the noticed that her boobs had disappeared. Her body had become a disgusting mess of oozing flesh. Her nose grew larger, huge actually and did her head, it grew larger but didn’t fix her abnormally large nose. Her jaw moved in front of her top set of teeth and created an underbite. Her bottom teeth grew unevenly and longer. Her back formed a bunch and her head was in place of her chest. Her skin turned rotten and old. Greg had transformed his 13 year old sister, Stephanie, into a giant troll, about 5 inches taller than Greg with the hunchback. Her body was completely ruined and she was left in an old ugly mess of crying her eyes out. Greg walked into her room pretending not to have noticed her, and walked downstairs and sat on the sofa next to his father’s sofa. <br />
<br />
He didn’t even acknowledge that his son was there, so Greg tested how long before he’d notice something happen. His mother deserved better for how much she does, so Greg makes his father everything a woman wants (in his eyes). His fathers fat melted away, as new muscle replaced it, he looked like he did in his marriage photo, his proposal photo, any of his old photos on the wall. His muscles grew larger than they were then, larger than he’d ever had before. His face became sexier and more masculine and grew a sexy small but elegant beard, his polo shirt turned into a tank top that was much too small and showed his every curve and dent of his body. His jeans turned into shorts that show off the outline of his penis, which was a pretty impressive 7 hard, but agree knew he could do better, so he made the penis a 12 flaccid, and a 17 hard. His father had become the ideal husband (to what he thinks women want) and his mother could not be disappointed about. But in return to the sexy gentleman his mother recieved, his mother needed a makeover for the pleasure of not just his father, but also his mother. His mothers body was already above average with a large enough chest and wide enough hips and a big enough ass. <br />
<br />
His mother’s face grew beauty first, her eyes became the most lovely blue and her cheeks became high up  and rosey red. Her lips plumped up for the perfect kiss on the lips or for something else. Her waist became thinner, very thin actually and her legs skimmed down for the perfect position. Her hips flared out wider than they were, twice the size, her ass grew wider, and bigger, and fatter, a cushion to sit on. Her neck became thinner and her shoulders became smaller, then her back muscles grew stronger to support her already large bust. Now the main attraction was going to begin, her DD cup chest grew bigger by 3 cups, then 4, then 8, then finishing on a QQQ cup, her boobs jiggled and swung in every way with the slightest movement. Her clothes changed to a button up white shirt and a small apron. The shirt popped open within seconds of it existing, her cleavage being seen from a mile away. <br />
<br />
Greg’s mother and father hugged each other and then very sexually kissed each other, his father grabbing and squeezing her large and round chest while his mother grabbed his fathers package and began squeezing. They instantly ran upstairs, but got his mothers hips stuck on the railing. They ran into their bedroom and locked the door shut. <br />
<br />
Greg walked back into his sisters room and looked at her, still crying at her hideous look, she looked back at him. He decided he’d make his sister incredibly curvy to pay her back for what he did, he told her, “sorry for doing that, have some huge tits and a really big ass,” her body shrunk back to normal, everything being changed back, including her clothes. Then her ass began to grow larger, like a water ballon inflating, but it got bigger and bigger until it was too big to stand, it felt and looked like a bean bag, but her hips grew even wider, and wider, until they were too big to get out of the door. Then as she managed to stand up again, her boobs began to get bigger, they grew as big as watermelons and didn’t stop. Her boobs now touched the floor even when she was standing. Her boobs were now the size of two watermelons, so nearly the size of her whole body, she was a fairly short girl, maybe 5 foot 2 or so, so the boobs and ass looked huge on her.<br />
<br />
Now he had to do something about his 6 year old brother and 9 year old sister..</p>
