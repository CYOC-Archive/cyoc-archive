<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>For a while, I wasn&#39;t sure if anything would come of this split. However, after some pushing and inspiration from rawr7, I&#39;ve decided to give Todd his own story. I&#39;m more than willing to hear people&#39;s ideas as to what they&#39;d like to see happen in a chapter, and help is always greatly appreciated! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ahh~! Deeper! Please go deeper!” <br />
<br />
The wolf whined in pleasure as his ass was roughly pounded by the snow leopard, who had him pinned down by his shoulders. The feline looked down at the wolf with a predatory glint in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“You like it when I breed you like this?” The leopard asked, thrusting his length deep into the wolf’s hole. The canine’s adorable moans of pleasure were enough to keep him going for hours on end. <br />
<br />
“Yes! I love it!” the wolf whined, letting his tongue loll out of his mouth as his entire body shook with pleasure. “Please….please don’t stop!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t plan on stopping until I fill your slutty ass, pup,” the leopard replied, thrusting harder and faster than he had been. “Won’t be much longer now…are you ready?” <br />
<br />
“Yes! Please fill me with your cum!”<br />
<br />
The snow leopard made a few more hard thrusts before cumming inside the wolf’s hole. Upon feeling the warm feline seed inside of him, the wolf cried out in pleasure as he came as well, coating himself and his lover in his seed. When their orgasms died down, the two lay on the bed, soaking in the afterglow of another intense fucking. And frankly, Todd didn’t want it any other way. <br />
<br />
It had been nearly a month since the events that took place in Hollywoo. After Sebastian was defeated and the Book of Myth was acquired, Todd decided that it would be for the best if he returned home to Arizona. Because he didn’t have a book of his own to properly defend himself, Todd essentially felt as if the others were just babysitting him. While Xarxos had given him a pep talk and tried to convince him to stay, the satyr was firm in his decision. Respecting his employee’s wishes, Xarxos thanked Todd for coming to the convention and helping get their sex toy brand out into the world, even going as far as to give him a rather generous promotion. <br />
<br />
The next morning, Trog had a private jet arranged to take Todd back home. Before saying his goodbyes and apologizing for inconveniencing everyone, Trog used the Book of Beasts to transform Todd from a short, plump satyr back into the form he had felt the most comfortable: a lean, twunkish wolf. Then, he says boarded the plane. <br />
<br />
After landing in Arizona, the wolf made a beeline towards the club where he’d first met Mark. He prayed that reality hadn’t rewritten him out of the snow leopard’s life. When he entered Mark’s studio loft apartment, Todd was quickly met with a shower of hugs and kisses from a very happy snow leopard, which eased every single one of his worries. <br />
<br />
From there, things went back to normal. During the day, Todd would go to work and develop new marketing strategies to sell more sex toys, and during the night, he and Mark would “test” those same toys. That’s how things happened for the past month, and that’s how Todd hoped they would stay. <br />
<br />
The wolf sighed happily as his lover rested on top of him, the leopard’s cock still buried deep inside his hole. Mark rested his head in the crook of Todd’s neck, nuzzling him affectionately. <br />
<br />
“God, you’re such a good fuck, puppy dog,” the snow leopard said<br />
<br />
The wolf and the snow leopard fell asleep, holding each other close.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
Todd was awoken by the need to piss. Badly. The wolf let out a quiet groan as he slowly opened his eyes, looking around the loft. Mark was still on top of him, and the leopard’s cock was still deeply lodged inside his ass. Todd reached over and grabbed his phone off the nightstand, looking at the time: 3 AM. He put his phone back down before gently rolling his lover off from on top of him and pulling his cock out. The wolf let out a soft moan as he felt the remnants of their prior lovemaking session dribble down the back of his leg. Such a shame that it had to go to waste…<br />
<br />
Todd groggily made his way to the bathroom, still half asleep. He flipped the light switch and closed the door before walking over to the toilet. Reaching down, the wolf grabbed his cock and aimed, letting out a relaxed sigh as he emptied his bladder. <br />
<br />
A few seconds went by, and Todd still wasn’t done. This piss was going on for a long time, but then again, he did drink a lot of water at dinner. A minute went by, and Todd was still going. Now things were starting to get weird. The wolf looked down, only for his eyes to widen in terror. <br />
<br />
His entire lower body had changed back into that of a satyr’s.<br />
<br />
The young man panicked and tried to move his hand from his cock, only to realize that his hand was now attached to his cock. His answer as to why would soon be answered, as his hand and cock both rapidly turned to stone.<br />
<br />
“No no no no no! Not again!” Todd cried, beginning to hyperventilate. He tried to move away from the toilet, but his body wouldn’t respond. His hooves and legs had completely turned to stone by this point, and his cock was still spraying out water. The satyr could feel the stone spreading up his chest, ready to overtake his entire body and turn him back into a fountain. As the stone reached his neck, Todd let out a scream of terror, only for it to be quickly silenced as his head completely turned to stone. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
“Todd? Todd?! Todd, snap out of it!” <br />
<br />
Todd felt a pair of hands shake him rather aggressively, causing him to open his eyes. Mark was standing over him, a look of concern on his face. The wolf was curled up in a fetal position on the bathroom floor. He began to breathe heavily as he quickly looked over himself. Gray fur? Check. Paws? Check. Canine cock and sheath? Check and check. He was still a wolf. Overwhelmed with relief and fear, the wolf began to sob. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what’s the matter?” Mark asked, kneeling to check on the wolf. “Another one of those hallucinations?”<br />
<br />
Todd nodded his head, sniffling as tears dampened his fur. “Y-Yeah…” he stuttered. “I-I’m fine now…”<br />
<br />
That was a lie. Todd was far from fine. Ever since his encounter with the gorgon in the maze to Sebastian’s manor, the wolf had been having waking nightmares and hallucinations about suddenly being turned back into a pissing satyr statue. The thought of turning back into a statue and completely losing himself was terrifying to the young wolf. <br />
<br />
“Do you want to go back to sleep, or would you like to sit and stay up for a little bit?” Mark asked, rubbing Todd’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Y-Yeah…yeah, I’d be okay with that…”<br />
<br />
Just then, there was the sound of someone knocking at the door to the apartment. Mark stood up and looked out the bathroom door towards the front door, a confused look on his face. <br />
<br />
“Who the hell is knocking on my door at 3 AM?” The snow leopard muttered to himself. He turned back to the wolf and gave him a sympathetic smile. “I’m going to go see who that is, okay?” <br />
<br />
“O-Okay…” Todd sniffed, wiping tears from his eyes as Mark left the bathroom. The wolf had no idea how to explain the nightmares he’d been having to the snow leopard. There was no easy way for him to say that he had been turned into a pissing satyr statue by a gorgon who was summoned by a crazy, book-wielding psychopath before he was turned back into a wolf by an old, overweight bugbear and a minotaur. Maybe one day he’d find a way to tell Mark about the books and everything that had happened to him on that trip…<br />
<br />
“Uh, hey Todd?” Mark called. The wolf looked toward Mark’s voice to find the snow leopard standing by the front door, which was cracked open slightly. “Mind coming here for a sec?” <br />
<br />
Todd nodded and got up off the floor, wiping more tears from his eyes. Why exactly was Mark calling him over to the door? Was something wrong? <br />
<br />
“Do you…know the guy at the door?” the leopard whispered, to not let the person on the other side of the door hear. <br />
<br />
“I’ll check and see,” Todd whispered back. The wolf opened the front door slightly and peered out, only for his eyes to widen. <br />
<br />
Standing on the other side of the door was a tall, muscular Minotaur covered from head to toe in shaggy brown fur. He wore nothing but a leather loincloth that covered his massive, bovine equipment, but none of that was what surprised Todd. What surprised him were the various bandages that covered the Minotaur’s body. He had bandages wrapped around his head covering his left eye and a few around his biceps on either arm and one that wrapped diagonally across his muscular chest. Atop his head was one long horn that was capped in gold, and the remains of where another horn had broken off. The Minotaur had been beaten up…badly. Under his right arm was a small parcel that had been wrapped in brown paper and tied up with a white string. <br />
<br />
“Xarxos?!” Todd semi-shouted, trying to keep his voice down. “Xarxos is that you?!”<br />
<br />
The minotaur nodded, breathing heavily. “May I…come in?”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
The wolf stood by the coffee machine in the kitchen, waiting for it to finish brewing. When it finally finished, Todd removed a mug from under the machine. He grabbed a second mug that had already been filled with coffee and carried them both over to the living area, where Xarxos was sitting in an armchair and Mark was sitting on the couch directly across from him. The wolf handed the minotaur one of the mugs, and he graciously accepted it. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Xarxos took a small sip of the coffee. <br />
<br />
“So what the hell are you doing here?” Todd asked as he sat down on the couch next to Mark. “I thought you guys were busy trying to fight Arcane and Time.”<br />
<br />
“Arcane and Time?” Mark asked, giving the wolf a weird look. <br />
<br />
“We were…” the minotaur said, blowing on his coffee before taking another sip. “We had a plan in place to take out Time. We spent weeks fine-tuning and perfecting every little aspect of it to stand a better chance. Rok even used the Book of Divination and saw multiple futures where our plan worked. Our plan was essentially foolproof.”<br />
<br />
“Then what happened?” Todd asked. Xarxos put his mug on the end table and lowered his head into his hands, shaking his head. <br />
<br />
“It failed,” the minotaur said quietly. “Time, he…he did something to make our plan fail. I vaguely remember Rok mentioning something about him being able to jump timelines, and…” <br />
<br />
“You think that’s what he did,” Todd finished. The three of them sat in silence for a minute before the wolf broke the silence and asked “So why don’t you develop a new plan that accounts for his timeline jumping? You guys have the numbers on him, so you can-” <br />
<br />
“They’re gone, Todd.”<br />
<br />
The wolf felt his blood run cold upon hearing what the minotaur said. “Wh-What?” <br />
<br />
Xarxos looked up at Todd, and the wolf could see the tears that had welled up in his eyes. “They’re gone,” he repeated. “Trog, Rusty, Rok…all three of them are gone. I watched as Time froze them where they stood, their faces showing the fear they felt just before they had been frozen. I…I barely made it out with my life…” The minotaur gestured to the various bandages on his body, and the wolf winced slightly.<br />
<br />
“Are they…dead?” Todd asked quietly. <br />
<br />
The minotaur shook his head, taking a second to wipe tears from his eyes. “I don’t know…” he replied. “I don’t know if being frozen in place kills them outright or if it just turns them into living statues.” <br />
<br />
“So then…what’s going to happen?” the wolf asked a noticeable amount of fear in his voice. “He has five of the six books, right? All he needs is one more before he essentially becomes a god.”<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t have the other’s books,” Xarxos said, taking a few deep breaths to recover from crying. He put the parcel that he had been carrying on the coffee table in front of them and undid the knot that was holding it all together. He tore off the paper and revealed the parcel’s contents: a large, leather-bound book with an embossed cover.”<br />
<br />
Todd’s eyes widened. “Is…is that?”<br />
<br />
“The Book of Transfiguration,” Xarxos said quietly. “The others slipped me their books before they were frozen. I’m not sure how or why I was able to escape with the book, but I’m counting my blessings as they come.”<br />
<br />
“So then, if you have the books, what’s stopping you from going back and taking out Time for real this time?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
Xarxos shook his head. “No, I can’t do that. I’m in no shape to fight Time with my injuries. Besides, he’d be expecting me.”<br />
<br />
“So then, who’s going to take the book?” The wolf shifted his gaze from the book to the minotaur, and he saw the sorrowful look in his eyes. It didn’t take him long to realize who Xarxos intended to give the book. <br />
<br />
“No…” Todd said quietly, shaking his head. “Xarxos, I’m not taking the book.”<br />
<br />
“Todd, please,” the minotaur begged. “You’re the only one that I can trust to wield the book.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve seen the power that those books hold, and I don’t want any part of it anymore,” the wolf said. “Right now, I have the life that I’ve always wanted. I have a well-paying job that I’m happy with and a boyfriend who loves me more than anything. I don’t want to use that book to change my life, and I don’t want to unintentionally ruin people’s lives either! Not to mention that I’ll be forced to deal with, what, four Auditors at the same time?!”<br />
<br />
“I know that it’s a lot to take in, but please realize that there’s no one else I can trust right now,” Xarxos explained. “When we defeat Time, we can save everyone, give them back their respective books, and you can go back home, never having to deal with another one of these books again. Please, Todd…I need you…” <br />
<br />
Todd nervously looked at the minotaur before shifting his gaze to the book on the table in front of him. He didn’t like this at all. While the Book of Transmutation had been the thing to give him his ideal life, it could just as easily rip that away from him. One wrong move, one wrong spell, and everything would come crashing down. But then…it would all come crashing down if Time or Arcane got all six books anyway…<br />
<br />
“Can someone please explain what the fuck is going on here?” Mark asked, snapping Todd out of his thoughts. “How the hell do you know a minotaur? Who or what are Time and Arcane, and why are you fighting them? Who the hell are Trog, Rusty, and Rok? What are Auditors? And most importantly, what’s the deal with the giant book?” <br />
<br />
“Oh, right…” Xarxos said, scratching the back of his head. “You aren’t exactly caught up to speed. It’s a bit of a long story…”</p>
