<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty stood next to the table, ready to head up to his room. He was standing there, holding his hand over his waistband to hide his pubes. Damn, his groin looked stuffed! His dick must be almost twice as big. He was a bit embarrassed that he was bulging so much and only wearing boxers; it was very obvious to his family what he was packing. Likewise, the balls hung so low they tugged the boxers down, showing off a little bit where his dark pubes met the thick treasure trail on his belly. He could see Dustin was gawking at you. Your not surprised; he is the only one aware of your changes.<br />
<br />
Just then, June came out of the kitchen with a plate. It was full of scrambled eggs. &quot;I guess I could have som more!&quot;, he rumbled in his new baritone. He sat down at the table, shirtless, and only in boxers, and proceeded to eat some eggs. As he ate, he couldn&#39;t believe the changed that had happened. Looking at his buff, hairy, and hung body, he decided to make breakfast even more interesting. &quot;Every bite of food I take, I grow a bit bigger, hairier, and masculine. Dustin will be the only one who will notice&quot;. he muttered to himself. To text it out, he took a bite. He felt a shiver down his body. Ty continued eating.<br />
<br />
Glancing down, Ty saw that his chest and stomach were covered in a thick rug; almost a bit too much, he thought to himself. He was a bit nervous for it to get even hairier. His legs were long, muscular, and covered in hair. His feet must have been about size 15 and had hair growing out on the tops of his feet and his toes. Ty saw Dustin staring at him. Ty grinned and dramatically raised up a muscular arm and scratched the hairy bushy pit that resided underneath it. He had so much pit hair now that it spilled out even with his arms at his sides! Dustin gawked, mouth agape, at the sight of his hairy brother. Ty lowered his arm and flexed his massive bicep. It jumped up with thick muscles; damn, this feels good, Ty thought to himself with a grin. Ty scratched his face and noted that it felt like he had even more sandpappery stubble on his face. It was sure to turn into a short beard in no time!<br />
<br />
As Ty continued eating his plate of eggs, he noticed his overstuffed crotch was feeling even tighter! His balls and cock were growing again. Pretty soon, his boxers would burst. He felt himself getting a bit hard too, from the pressure. God, he was horny. His kind was swimming in testosterone and hormones, which he wasn&#39;t used to! He silently wished that his boxers were one size bigger. There was a bit of relief as they grew, but they were still stuffed full of his manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, are you planning on shaving before school? I don&#39;t want you to get in trouble for that beard again. You know the schools policy&quot;, June said to Ty. He raised his hand and scratched his face. Whoa! It had surpassed stubble already and had become a short beard! &quot;uhhh, yeah. No problem. I can shave it after breakfast!&quot;, he boomed in his deep, masculine voice. In reality, Ty had no idea how to shave.<br />
<br />
As breakfast continued, Ty noticed his barrel shoulders seemed even wider. He seemed to be even more muscular, too. His biceps were larger and his pecs stuck out more, not that you could tell under the brown rug on his chest. Discretely looking at his biceps, he saw sparse, but thick and long, brown hairs growing up his biceps and onto his shoulders. With a quick feel, he could feel some scattered hairs all along his back. Damn, he was becoming a furball! He was going to look like a caveman soon!<br />
<br />
Ty saw Dustin still staring at him. Ty reached up and scratch his hairy pit bush again, to rub it in. Just then, Ty smelled a musky odor. He realized that his pits smelled like BO! June noticed too. &quot;Ty, I know you have a problem with body odor, but I don&#39;t even know why we spent so much money on that clinical deodorant if you refuse to wear it!&quot;. Ty flashed a toothy smile and grinned. &quot;Sorry mom, I&#39;ll put some on after breakfast&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ty felt his dick lurch in his too tight boxers again. Fuck, he was horny. Ty continued eating, he realized this has been his favorite breakfast so far!</p>
