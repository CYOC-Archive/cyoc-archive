<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Please tell me you have something for us to wear,” Stephanie frowned as she scanned Ann’s bedroom. Ann could only shrug, she hasn’t been anticipating her get together with friends would turn into a sleepover with a group of preteens. Looking through her dresser she produced four large T-shirt’s she sometimes wore to bed.<br />
<br />
“Guess these could work,” she shrugged. The girls each took one looking them over. “These will do,” Stephanie smiled. Quickly the others watched as the raven haired girl let her overly large jeans fall to the floor before shucking off her blouse. Now standing in an overly baggy bra and panties her friends blushed at the girls lack of modesty.<br />
<br />
“Geez Steph,” Ann exclaimed. “What are you doing? Go change in the bathroom or something.”<br />
<br />
“What,” the girl frowned. “We’re all girls. It’s no different than being in a locker room. Besides looking at you three it’s not like we’re hiding much.”<br />
<br />
The others frowned as they looked over their barely pubescent  bodies. All of them were barely entering puberty at this point with boyish bodies and small conical breasts. Shrugging the girls followed Stephanie’s lead, quickly discarding their large adult clothing and throwing on the T-shirt’s. When they had finished they were amazed by their appearance.<br />
<br />
No one would believe that these four girls had been adults only moments earlier. Four 12 year old girls now stood in T-shirt’s that descended to mid theigh on each of them. Gazing at their appearances it began to set in that they were children now. Children wearing very ill fitting underwear and overly large socks.<br />
<br />
“Umm Jackie,” Megan said shyly. “Is their anything you can do about our underwear? I’m worried they’re going to fall off if I stop holding them.”<br />
<br />
Jackie now thought about what to do. She like the others felt the same way, her formerly form fitting panties were now in danger of sliding off her boyish hips. “Let me try something okay?”<br />
<br />
Megan nodded as Jackie made a wish. The girls all gasped in astonishment as they felt their underwear shrink to fit their childish bodies. The girls now peaked down the front of their shirts astonished to see their underwear had transformed into preteen fashions.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” Ann gasped, noticing her plain cotton panties and small bra. “That’s pretty impressive their Jackie.”<br />
<br />
Jackie smiled, thanking her girlfriend. “Glad it worked just wish it was something a little bit more fashionable, forgot preteens really aren’t interested in cute underwear.”<br />
<br />
The girls giggled as they now began to make their way back to the living room. “So what do ya u want to do,” Megan asked as she made herself comfortable on the couch. Ann and Jackie shrugged as they sat down on the floor. “Not sure,” Ann said. “I guess we could watch a scary movie. I always did that on those rare occasions that someone slept over.”<br />
<br />
“Oooo I like that idea,” Megan said excitedly. “Nothing more fun than scaring yourself with friends. Got any popcorn?”<br />
<br />
“I think so,” Ann stated. “Jackie you want to get it?”<br />
<br />
Jackie lept to her feet as she made her way into the kitchen. As the girls began to talk they noticed Stephanie leave the bedroom carrying a large amount of bottles. “What are you doing Steph,” Ann asked.<br />
<br />
Stephanie smiled as she sat cross legged in front of Ann and Megan. “Well I was going through your makeup supplies Ann,” she smirked. “I don’t know about you but I was hoping we could give each other makeovers while we watch the movie.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Megan stared at the supplies Stephanie had brought over, chuckling at what Stephanie had brought. It appeared the girl had brought everything Ann owned out into the living room; lipstick, mascara, blush and nail polish now laynscattered at their feet.<br />
<br />
“Geez Steph,” Megan laughed. “It looks like you brought everything Ann owns out here. What are you planning?”<br />
<br />
“The works,” she replied with an impish grin. “My parents never let me have a sleepover when I was a kid so I want the works. Lipstick, eye shadow, even my nails done. I don’t want to miss out on any of it. So cmon, who wants to go a little crazy?”<br />
<br />
Megan and Ann looked at each other shrugging before smiling. “Guess it could be fun,” Ann said. Megan nodded as she picked up some nail polish. “Definitely could be,” she grinned. “So how we gonna do this? Do we do our own nails or do we trust someone else to do them.”<br />
<br />
“I think it could be more fun if we let someone else do it,” Ann giggled. “Just nothing too ugly okay. Have fun, be a little silly if you want. We can clean it up later.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds awesome,” Stephanie exclaimed. “So who wants to make me over?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll do it,” Ann said happily. “If you’ll do mine?”<br />
<br />
Stephanie grinned as she grabbed one of Ann’s feet and removed her sock. “It’s a deal,” she said happily. Ann smiled as she removed Stephanie’s socks and began to sort through her nail polish.<br />
<br />
As Jackie returned with popcorn and soda she could see Ann and Stephanie engaged in their makeovers. Looking over at Megan she could see the girl anxiously looking at her. “Let me guess you want in on the makeover too huh? Megan nodded enthusiastically causing Jackie to smile, it had been far too long since she had done someone’s make up.<br />
<br />
“Okay Meg looks like you and me are making each other over.”<br />
<br />
After setting up the movie and four individual bowls of popcorn Jackie now found herself painting Megan’s toes while hers were painted as well. The girls giggled happily as they talked, the conversation was mostly fun. Stephanie and Megan asked Jackie and Ann about their childhood as well as what made them decide to take their friendship to a romantic level.<br />
<br />
“Hard to say what caused it,” Ann shrugged as she continued to apply a coat of polish. “I mean we became fast friends. Jackie kind of made the first move.”<br />
<br />
Megan and Stephanie let out a happy sigh as they looked at the two of them. “So what were you twonup to last night,” Stephanie teased, causing Jackie and Ann to blush. “You two have some fun with magic?”<br />
<br />
“Sort of,” Jackie said sheepishly as she looked over at her girlfriend. Stephanie and Megan paused as they looked at the two. The only sound breaking the silence was the sounds of the movie in the background. “Well share,” Megan said excitedly. “Tell us what you two did. Did you two have a sleepover or did you two relive your first date or what?”<br />
<br />
“Actually Jackie really didn’t change at all last night,” Ann smirked, causing Jackie to blush. “She decided to make me younger though.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” Stephanie said looking over at Jackie. “So....just how young did your girlfriend make. We’re you her little girl?”<br />
<br />
Jackie and Ann looked at each other, blushing and unable to answer. Stephanie watched this, her jaw dropping as she began to realize that that was exactly what happened. “No way,” she said in awe. “You made her a little girl. How old was she?”<br />
<br />
Ann blushed his doing up four fingers as she gazed down at Stephanie’s freshly painted toes. “Four,” Stephanie exclaimed. “Your girlfriend made you four!?! Wow! What was that like?”<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t bad,” Ann shrugged. “It actually was kind of fun after awhile. Jackie took very good care of me, she’s a natural mom.”<br />
<br />
“Your too kind,” Jackie giggled. “Thankfully Ann was the sweetest little girl and adorable.”<br />
<br />
Stephanie nodded as she finished applying a final coat of polish to Anns toes. Admiring her work she now looked up at Ann. “Hope you like it,” she smiled. “Remember you saying you were a bit of a goth back in the day so I went with a dark blue.” Ann looked down at her toes, smiling at the blue Stephanie appeared to have expertly applied. “They look great,” she said happily. “Decided on a light pink for you. Hope it’s okay.”<br />
<br />
“It’s perfect thank you.”<br />
<br />
As the girls admired the work the other had done they happily began to talk once more. The sleepover was going quite well so far. The girls all could agree so far that deciding on a sleepover was a great idea.</p>
