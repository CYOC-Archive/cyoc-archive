<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>The fat brothers iced down the Foster's, and were ready to smoke.  Jeff opened a pale blue tube releasing a Gran Premio.  He slowly rolled the inexpensive stogie under his nose, and carefully moistened the wrapper before reaching for the wooden matches.  With an expert skill of a long-time smoker, Jeff fired up the cigar, and instantly was inhaling the smoke deep into his lungs without a single cough.  As he lighted his cigar, Jason carefull packed his new pipe with just a small amount of tobacco, set to take plenty of time to get his new pipe broken in.  Before no time, the den was filling with the brother's aromatic smoke.  Both guys were smoking as if each of them had smoked for years.  </P>
<P>Their contemplation was broken when they head a vehicle come down the drive, and their Dad leave it.  The brothers ran to their bedrooms, so Dad would not see them right away.  their voices had changed little, and they would speak to Dad before facing him.  Jeff, being the elder, called to Dad first; finally telling the man that surprises were forthcoming, and they hoped he would be able to accept the changes.  Dad told his sons that he would deal with whatever was wrong.  Jeff told his Dad that nothing was wrong.......just different.  Jeff reminded Dad that when Jeff was young, he had always been chubby, only fixing his weight problem with hours in the gym, and a strict diet.  He admitted that He had never been comfortable  being slender.  He had decided to bulkup a good bit,.  He admitted that he was not happy being slender, and had made some changes.  He slowly opend the bedroom door, and walked into the den.  Dad's was overwhelmed....he could not believe his first son was so big and fat.  He also appeared to be about 15 to 20 years older.  The boy even had a long, full beard below his nearly BALD head. Obviously, Dad was concerned, but was determined not to overreact.  Jeff gave Dad a cold beer, and got him to sit down.  He carefully let Dad know that Jason was fat too, but he was eventually taking on a character and job.  That's when Jason came in.  Dad could do nothing be stare at his sons in astonishment.  The boys stayed calm and returned to smoking.    Jason fired up one of his stogies, gave it to his father, and lighted one for himself.  His brother slowly lighted his new pipe. </P>
<P>Finally Dad demanded to know how the boys had made the changes.  Jeff told him about the Chronivac he was testing.  They all went into Jeff's bedroom so Dad could see the machine.  Dad told Jeff to demonstrate it, stating he'd be the guinea pig for the boy.  Jeff asked his father if he had some secret wishes of his own that Jeff could fulfill.  Dad grinned and blushed, admitting that like his boys, he'd always liked fairly huge beerbellies, especially if the man with the beerbelly was muscular other places.  Jeff said he understood, and he began entering the data into the Chronivac.  Jeff asked how Dad wanted his hair.........Dad even admitted that he had hoped to develop male pattern baldness, but he didn't.  Jeff said he'd do it, and Dad added that he wanted it to be the most sever degree of MPB that happens.  Jeff said....done, Dad.  Jeff suggested that Dad immediately get out of the clothes he was wearing before it became a problem.  Dad did so.  The boys gat Dad another beer, and waited with him for the modifications to begin.  Dad first realized the changes had begun when his scalp began to itch like mad.  As he scratched his head, hair began to fall out in large clumps.  Dad worked over his scalp until 3/4 of his dome was hairless, just a narrow horseshoe fringe of hair around his ears and low across the back of the neck.  Without missing a beat, his arms and legs began to tingle. They began to grow larger with developing muscle, and not fat.  Even his neck expanded with muscles.  Jeff and Jason got Dad to move into their bathroom for the mirror.  Dad went to flexing his arms, and legs showing their new size and definition..  Suddenly his mid-torso/belly began to balloon straight out from him, inflating into a huge, fairly firm ballbelly that seemed enormous at first.  It took approximately 10 minutes for Dad's new ballbelly to end it's growth.  Dad couldn't do anything but stroke that gut like crazy and try to see it from all sides in the mirror.  Jason wrapped the tape measure around Dad's new belly just as he and Jeff had done.  Dad's brand new ballbellywas 62 inches around. Just between his boys.  Dad asked Jeff if he wanted to change again, could he.  Jeff assured his Dad yes, then realized that they had forgotten to tell Dad that the change stayed a minimum of 21 days.  All changes, reversals, had to be then made before the 28th day when they became permanent.  The three newly enlarged men would be fat pardners for the next three weeks.  Jeff said he had an idea to explain the appearance of the two new fat guys there.  Jason could be Dad's older brother and he could be Dad's younger brother here visiting from across the country.  Dad said that sounded fine to him.  Jason agreed.  Jeff would now become Dad's older brother, Harlan.  I would be their younger brother,Jake.  We all agreed.  the three fat men had relaxed enough to finally inspect each other's growth.   Jason/Harlan was the most extreme, primarily due to having been aged so many years.  To the shock of all three men, all of them were becoming aroused at the sight of the themselves and the others.  Sweat shorts do little to hide a rock hard mancock.</P></p>
