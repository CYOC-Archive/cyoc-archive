<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s just go and see if we can find our way outta here. Hopefully there&#39;s something, some route the jocks missed.&quot; Monique whispered to her boyfriend. Gary nodded along, deciding to follow. Monique was a lot more knowledgeable about the outdoors than he was. Supposedly her family were hunters on top of being involved with the police.<br />
<br />
Gary very distinctly remembered meeting Mr. and Mrs. Stevens. They were a prominent and somewhat successful conservative black family - and as soon as Mr. Stevens got a look at Gary, there seemed to be a game of fifty questions played. Mr. Stevens it seemed assumed Gary&#39;s sexuality much the same as a number of others did. But before long, he ascertained that Gary was at least actively with his daughter. So he backed off, at least on that. The man was however rather unpleasant, terse, and strict. Though at least he didn&#39;t mind the two of them fooling around - &quot;Teenagers do that&quot;, he&#39;d said.<br />
<br />
It did not take very long for Gary and Monique to begin drifting away from Graham and Clara. <br />
<br />
The woods were not getting any thinner out here. They could barely see Graham and Clara back there at this rate. And they were still going. Gary thought he heard something get shouted by Graham, but he consciously decided to ignore it.<br />
<br />
<i>Fuck going back for that killjoy</i>, he decided. They were in enough trouble as it was already without needing Graham shouting over his shoulder to stop glancing at his girlfriend&#39;s ass. Maybe it was a straw version of Graham adopted in Gary&#39;s mind, but the stringent approach the older man took did not endear him. The guy just...ugh. It almost seemed like he superimposed his own personal history on Gary in order to try and &quot;do it all over better&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
They were still going...<br />
<br />
Gary looked around. The woods were thrumming with life at this rate. For some reason, the life swirling in the air and the sounds on the winds started to get him a little excited. He gulped and adjusted his cheerleading outfit. Fuck this thing was so tight, left nothing to the imagination. His girlfriends loved it whenever he wore it, but right now? He was regretting the decision to keep it on this long. <br />
<br />
<i>Calm down. Calm down Gary,</i> he told himself, <i>You&#39;re getting horny from a freaking walk in the woods.</i><br />
<br />
Gary wondered if Monique was consciously doing this, or if it was just the necessity of looking into all these smaller paths along the way. But even as Monique seemed to get really involved in looking around, Gary started to feel his hormones acting up in regards to her. Maybe it was the tight clothes she was wearing. Maybe it was his own attraction to his beautiful girlfriend and the increasingly isolated feeling of their situation. There was no Graham out here. There were no chaperones. They could really get away with something here.<br />
<br />
They could---<br />
<br />
Monique suddenly jumped as she watched a strange looking elk run through the path and out into the distance, pressing herself up against Gary - who at that point was still reeling from the impact of his hormones - and perhaps, something else pushing him toward arousal. &quot;Ohh, Gary, thank you---sorry, that fucking thing scared the---oh. Oh.&quot; She by now was noticing his situation. His half hard cock inside his tight leggings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody&#39;s feeling lively today.&quot; Monique mentioned, cupping Gary&#39;s turgid manhood - and inducing a heady breath from him as he enjoyed the feeling of her hand resting against his manhood. Very quickly that half-hard cock was not exactly staying that way. &quot;We...we shouldn&#39;t...&quot; She seemed to realize...<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that AFTER you start rubbing on my dick.&quot; Gary said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fair,&quot; Monique nodded, and then said, &quot;How about I get you to one orgasm, then we keep going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One cum, sounds fair!&quot; Gary said with a grin, followed by a surprised gasp as Monique pushed him up against a tree, &quot;Ooh, feisty!&quot; A few chuckles and then he dropped his arms as he watched her press her breasts against his chest, cupping his hard cock with her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, big boy, let&#39;s get you off,&quot; and that was all Monique said as she started grinding her body against Gary&#39;s, roughly massaging his manhood with her hand at first before moving into more subtle and delicate strokes on the masculine organ. Gary for his part moaned deeply, arms gripping the sides of the tree. He usually wasn&#39;t one to go along with getting roughed up like this, but fuck he was enjoying this so far. Usually he liked to be in charge in the bedroom, so maybe it was just the role reversal that got him up and moving.<br />
<br />
Before long Monique took to grinding her own crotch, wet from the arousal and sensations, against Gary&#39;s extremely prominent impression at the front of his leggings. She deeply enjoyed getting Gary worked up like this, even though she knew once she got him to a certain point he&#39;d fuck her really roughly. A prospect she quite enjoyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;As soon as you let up...I&#39;m...I&#39;m gonna really fuck you, Monique!&quot; Gary growled as he felt his cock give a twitch. Perhaps more than a twitch. Gary&#39;s manhood was starting to change. Beginning to warp and grow. He was already surprisingly well hung for someone who so resembled a twink, but as he got worked up by Monique, his manhood if anything grew bigger, his arousal stronger and stronger. But its shape was altering just as well.<br />
<br />
The veins stood out more, his circumcision reversing itself as skin grew around it anew. Starting to resemble less a human foreskin and more something else. The cock starting to look more red, needy, and pulsing with pre-cum...!<br />
<br />
Gary couldn&#39;t handle it any more. Monique giggled as she felt herself get pushed to the floor, and gasped as she felt Gary&#39;s needy hands start pulling her pants and panties down as he eagerly got ready, poised over her - she spread her legs to welcome him in. &quot;Ahh...ah <i>Yes!!</i>&quot;, Gary poised himself over her, a wild smirk on his face, &quot;Fucking stop me from fucking now, Graham you fucking prude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, fuck Graham...&quot; Monique breathily stated, looking up at him. Gary was always a lively lover, but today he seemed really animate. Something seemed to be pushing him onward.<br />
<br />
Gary plunged in, and Monique outright screamed in pleasure as she felt his larger than usual and somewhat different so far cock plunge inside of her. Neither even noticed it as aroused as they were. Gary couldn&#39;t luxuriate in the moment in as far as he was distracted by his cock&#39;s weirdly sensitive nature. He started thrusting away, &quot;Yeah! Fuck Graham!&quot; He thrust deep, &quot;Fuck Graham!&quot; He finally took his top off, pressing his upper body against Monique - letting her feel his lean and tight, toned body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck Graham - Fuck Graham - let&#39;s make that a fucking cheer!&quot; Gary managed to say before lapsing into a moan. He kept thrusting away - Monique not quite able to answer him any more as she was dealing with the literally mind-numbing pleasure she was feeling right now. But Gary even as he pumped his hips and eagerly fucked his girlfriend could not help himself but try and keep going. Even as the chant began to distort a little bit; &quot;Fuck Graham! Fuck Graham! I&#39;d fuck Graham! I&#39;d fuck Graham!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary didn&#39;t even realize what he was saying as he kept pumping, kept fucking, chasing the elusive and pleasant conclusion to today&#39;s first of many erotic occasions. Something seemed to be pushing out from his rear or something. But right now Gary didn&#39;t care. He was too busy fucking - and shouting - and letting out all his frustrations and desires. &quot;I&#39;D! FUCK! GRAHAM!!&quot; Gary shouted...and then lapsed suddenly into, &quot;Oh fuck I&#39;m cumming.&quot;<br />
<br />
He just barely managed to get out of his girlfriend - he knew he&#39;d be dead meat if he knocked her up, spun around on his feet and just in time. Gary moaned in tune with it as he felt one big shot of cum land on the ground. Another! And another! Fuck he was so virile. Haah, he thought, who could mistake someone who came this thunderously from fucking a woman for---for a---a...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Gary...&quot; Monique blearily asked, quivering on the floor from her own erotic release just shortly before Gary&#39;s own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Yeah babe? Was that as good for you as it was for me...?&quot; He asked as he stroked his cock again, quivering from the feeling and realizing he needed to stroke a bit further than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gary, what&#39;s that on your butt? And---And what&#39;s---what&#39;s with your dick?&quot; Monique was starting to come down. And she saw something. By the time Gary realized something was up, and the obscuring clouds of arousal began to dissipate, Gary saw what had become of his manhood. And he saw a quivering, lupine tail hanging from his posterior. Waves of unreality hit him. A sense of surrealism - a wonder if he hit his head at all during that sex, and he was dreaming all of this.<br />
<br />
Gary screamed into a forest that devoured that scream and left no one but Gary and Monique the wiser.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
By now, Graham was starting to worry.<br />
<br />
None of the options were very good. Either Gary and Monique got lost, got hurt, or they got out but for some reason decided to <i>abandon the rest of their class</i>, or something more sinister happened. And here Graham was. The chaperone, the responsible adult who was supposed to look out for and keep them safe...resting on a fucking log with his knee acting up. Safe to say Graham hated his lot right now. He was at a space where he was regretting ever getting out of bed that morning those years ago when he busted up his knee. Regretting taking the risks he did for the game.<br />
<br />
Clara could tell that Graham was in a bad spot then, and she put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she urged him, &quot;You&#39;re the best chaperone we could ask for. You&#39;re doing your best. It&#39;s not your fault that Gary and Monique are horny idiots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah,&quot; Graham shook his head. Here he was getting reassured by someone he was supposed to be reassuring! He sighed and wondered where his life went. He tried to stand up, but his knee very urgently told him no - no he was not in fact going to be doing that quite yet.<br />
<br />
Clara for her part admitted that on some level, seeing how vulnerable, yet how obviously strong Graham was...it put her in some kind of mood. Graham looked easily about 220 lbs, a huge, muscular guy with a slight bit of tubby insulation at the edges. Not enough to make him seem exactly fat. Oh no, Clara could see his pecs right through his shirt. Every single dimple on them. But his abs were not as tight and etched as some guys&#39;, and it just seemed...approachable.<br />
<br />
Yet again she was feeling attracted toward her chaperone. She tried to tell herself that they&#39;d be discovered. That she&#39;d get in so much trouble. But they were out here. They were stranded. There might not even be school scale trouble for some time as of yet. So she saw fit to try and make her move. &quot;You know, Graham, I always found you really...impressively strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...That so?&quot; He seemed to brighten a little bit. &quot;You wanna know what they called me back in high school and college...? Funny, that they did so - and the gay term hadn&#39;t even entered vogue yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can guess...&quot; Clara smiled a little - she knew well enough to know what Graham was alluding to.<br />
<br />
&quot;They called me [The Bear]! Likened me to a big ol&#39; Grizzly Bear, charging across the field! Heh...&quot; Graham chuckled, &quot;The nickname really took on a new light as I...kinda realized who I was, what I liked, and more to the point, who I liked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara admitted she hoped that &quot;who he liked&quot; included her some day soon. She started inching closer to him, whispering, &quot;Graham...? Mr. Parker...?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was slightly alarmed by how close she was getting to him, but figured she might just want to feel more secure. He hoped it was just that. &quot;Yeah, Clara...?&quot; Feeling her so close by though seemed to start igniting something inside of him. A need he readily quashed. He was <i>not</i> getting involved with a fucking student. He was not going to fuck a student, that was for sure. Eighteen, yeah. But she was still his charge, and that would still be a tremendous abuse of his power as a chaperone. She might feel pressured to help him or do things for him going forward due to any sexual liaisons...<br />
<br />
No, why was he even thinking of this!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you---can you show me?&quot; Clara asked quietly, &quot;Can you uh, flex your biceps?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Whew, just...just my biceps</i>, Graham almost felt the tension rush out of his body as he heard that request. He couldn&#39;t see that being too much. Besides. She was just responding to seeing how big he was, and the stories of his old football glory! &quot;Yeah...yeah I can flex em for you.&quot; Graham promptly rolled up his sleeves and despite how things were right now, he felt a rush of some odd sense of pride as she gasped at the sight and <i>size</i> of his biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are just SO big!&quot; She said quietly, leaning forward to get a better look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah they are.&quot; Graham said with a smile as he flexed and showed how big they could get at full flexion. This just brought Graham right back to his glory days. When he would swagger back into the locker room among other gorgeous, muscled jocks. Letting himself see the masculine and powerfully built bodies on display - shuffling into the school&#39;s showers and having to stop himself from springing an erection around so many muscular forms. Thinking about grabbing one of them and inviting him along for a nice hard fuck alongside one of the cheerleaders. Letting his football bro fuck his ass while Big Bear Graham fucked the cheerleader&#39;s pussy---!<br />
<br />
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Graham was getting too into these fantasies! He stirred back to reality as he saw Clara&#39;s eyes were wide. She was staring - not as his flexed biceps, but at his rock solid, hard dick, sticking up in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Parker...&quot; The varsity cheerleader whispered to him. Leaning forward and cupping his good knee. Feeling her hand starting to tease the head of his insurgent rod. Graham whimpered, wanting to tell her to back off. To not do this kind of thing to him. That she was really teasing an older man too far...!<br />
<br />
Graham breathed, &quot;...Clara. Clara you---you can&#39;t be---be doing this kinda shit to me. You gotta stop. I don&#39;t---don&#39;t <i>wanna</i> be screwing around. I&#39;m---I&#39;m getting too horny. If you keep touching me there something might happen.&quot; He quivered in place. Clara looked at him - she was herself feeling subsumed in a lustful state.<br />
<br />
But she also knew they were so close to the cabin...what if someone else caught them out here?</p>
