<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was but one thing that was driving him slowly toward madness. It was extended out of its sheath, not quite hard, rubbing gently, comfortably, tantalisingly, against the inside of his pants, begging to be held. And then there was the smell coming off the girl, which wasn&#39;t helping matters, as he felt himself being pushed more and more to giving into dropping to his knees and thrusting his nose into the secret spot between her legs. Struggling not to give in, Tobias took a deep breath and told Eli, &quot;I&#39;ll give you some privacy to change,&quot; in what he hoped was a steady voice.<br />
<br />
The clothes still clutched tightly, Eli heard a slight tremble as he told her he&#39;d leave her to change. Curious to know what was wrong, she nodded and told him, &quot;Thanks,&quot; as she watched him fidget, gently tapping against his leg the hand holding the notepad their brothers had been writing on, before turning away.<br />
<br />
A quick glance about to see where she might find some place not so exposed whilst she changed and seeing nothing but the cabin, she sighed. Figuring here was as good as any, that she wasn&#39;t going to go change in the building, as something about it still creeped her out, she asked, &quot;Promise not to look?&quot; and when she heard, faintly from some ways behind her, Tobias tell her, &quot;Yeah,&quot; she dropped the clothes at her feet and reached down to grasp the hem of her sleeper shirt.<br />
<br />
Quickly, she pulled it up and over her head. Her breasts fully exposed, she enjoyed the moment of the cool air against her exposed skin before crossing an arm over her chest, covering the front of her breasts. As she squatted down and untangled the shirt Tobias had gotten her, Eli asked, &quot;So where do you think my brother and your brother might be? And could you give an estimate of how far ahead of us they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
To her surprise, there came no reply. Hastily pulling the shirt over her head, Eli turned and looked behind her. Seeing nothing but the forest, she hugged herself as she wondered where Tobias had gotten to. Hoping he wasn&#39;t peeping from somewhere off in the trees, she glanced about and then noticed that she still couldn&#39;t see the wolves. Muttering, &quot;If they were even were about,&quot; the teenage girl shivered at the prospect that the two wild canines might be close by and silently hoped that, wherever he was, the young man was good for his word and was giving her privacy to change. After a moment, she returned to changing her clothes.<br />
<br />
Off some ways, Tobias breathed deeply in and out of his nose. Still smelling the girl, he mumbled, &quot;Gah,&quot; and angrily ran a hand through his hair, careful not to touch his dog ears. Wanting to get away from her scent until he was no longer tempted, he looked about, choose a direction and began walking.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this did not help, as his cock would not go back into its sheath and kept rubbing against the inside of his pants. Breathing some more, trying to get his mind off anything to do with sex, he eventually stopped again. Looking down, ready to scream, he thought of how rich the woods smelled, how nice the weather was, what he planned to catch for lunch, but nothing helped. After a couple more frustrating minutes, desperate for relief, he undid the front of his pants and shucked the garment off.<br />
<br />
Naked from the waist down, he chuckled mirthlessly and snapped, &quot;There. Now you can go back into your sheath and stop rubbing against my pants,&quot; then found himself feeling silly and embarrassed that he was bitching out his dick.<br />
<br />
Another deep breath and he tossed his pants over his shoulder as he started to slowly walk. Not in hurry to go anywhere, figuring he&#39;d give Eli a couple more minutes before heading back, he was soon confronted by a new issue as he found the ragged edges of shirt kept brushing lightly against his dick. Uttering another, &quot;Gah,&quot; he peered down at his dog cock, hating what he was seeing and after a couple seconds, tossed aside his pants and the notepad, yanked off his shirt and tossed it over by the other garment and pad of paper.<br />
<br />
Naked, he stumbled over to the nearest tree, extended his arms out and placing his hands flat against the bark, he leaned against the tree. Still looking down at the canine dick, Tobias took a couple more deep breathes, this time in through his nose and out through his mouth. Trying to will the thing to go soft and go back into his sheath, his head snapped up when he heard a nearby noise. Thinking, worried, it might be Eli, not wanting her to see him naked, unaware that she already had, he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw one of the wolves. Peering intently at the animal, the young man eventually said, &quot;I suppose you never have to worry about anything like this,&quot; and glancing back down, he thumped a fist against the tree and cursed, &quot;Dammit. I wish the fucking thing wasn&#39;t so, insistent.&quot;<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the wolf dropped to its belly and inched forward. Watching the animal from the corner of his eye, wondering what it was going to do, Tobias was shocked when it abruptly jumped up the moment it was next to him, leaned its head in and licked his semi-erect member. Then did it again. Then repeated the action.<br />
<br />
Torn between being grossed out and liking the sensation, he shuddered, &quot;Yo-yo-you shou-shou-shou-shouldn&#39;t duh-duh-do that,&quot; and squeezing his eyes shut, he tried to resist the overwhelming urge to give in to his sexual needs.<br />
<br />
The wild canine did not heed him and instead continued licking him. Nervously, Tobias giggled and opening his eyes, he received a shock when he discovered that at some point he had dropped to his hands and knees. Looking back at the wolf, he desperately wanted to tell her to stop as he breathed in her scent, knowing that with a doubt she was still in heat.<br />
<br />
Instead, as he found it increasingly difficult to think straight, he whimpered, shifted and gently nuzzled her. The female wolf making a noise, turned and presented herself. Still fighting, Tobias closed his eyes again and made the mistake of taking another deep breath as he wondered how he&#39;d missed it was the she-wolf. Smelling her sex, he experienced another lapse as he opened his eyes and found himself inches away from her cunt. Trying to fight it, the young man tried to stand and back away and instead lunged forward. Dropping down on the back of the animal, he hugged her close as he began first rubbing his cock against her waiting slit, then began to prob at her.<br />
<br />
Another lapse and as the curse worked its insidious hold deeper, Tobias lost himself to the animal call of lust. Pushing his canine dick into the wolf&#39;s vagina, he grunted, gripped her tighter and began to make a thrusting motion. As he did this, his feet and hands began to shift and morph. As his member became fully erect and swelled, tying them together, his toes began to move as his feet took on a more digitigrade appearance. One toe completely disappeared, whilst his toenails changed into claws. Soft pads forming, Tobias was blissfully unaware, even as his hands also began to morph, with one finger becoming something more closer to a dew claw, while his remaining fingers shortened, the fingernails disappeared and claws also formed, and in the end leaving him with something that was not quite canine, but was nowhere near human.<br />
<br />
And as he finally came, the young man remained clueless still as he waited for the swelling to go out of his dick. The moments slowly ticking by, Tobias slowly came down from the amorous feeling and gradually becoming aware of what he done, he whimpered, &quot;Oh shit,&quot; and trying to pull out, thinking he still had time, he listened as the bitch yelped as he caught sight of his malformed hands. Starting to panic, whispered, &quot;No, no, no, no, please, take it back,&quot; he tried to disengage and wanting to cry, hating what he was seeing, still missing that his feet were even worse, the young man abruptly stopped what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Still knotted in place, he hugged the bitch closer in an attempt to hide his hands from sight. Throwing back his head, he let loose with a mournful howl. Lost to the fact that he was howling like a dog, he missed it completely when, first, the female wolf joined in them, from somewhere close by, the male wolf also followed suit.<br />
<br />
A couple miles away, Eli leapt up and looked in the direction of the noise of what she clearly recognised as wolves howling. Disturbed by what she was hearing, resisting the urge to flee, she hugged herself. Wondering where Tobias was as the noise abruptly ceased about as quickly as it had started, she considered going to look for him, then toyed with the idea to leave him and go find her brother. Conflicted as to which she should do, but leaning towards striking out to find Linus, the teenage girl continued peering in the direction of the noise.</p>
