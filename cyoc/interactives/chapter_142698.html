<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Master, do I have permission to go use the relief room?” Magnus’ giant cock twitched and he reached down to grope it with a massive hand. The head peeked out the bottom of his kilt and was dripping profusely.<br />
<br />
Dan nodded and smiled at the big sub. “Of course you do. Please, go relieve yourself, pup.” Dan recognized that while redheads grew up having to use the relief room out of necessity, Magnus’ was likely afraid to use them without permission due to not being a hyper-virile ginger. That, and he was more submissive than any sub he had ever met.<br />
<br />
“Thank you Master! I will be quick, I promise, and I will think of you the entire time!” The mass of meat beneath Magnus’ kilt perked up as he realized he had permission to seek relief. Magnus said his goodbyes to his brother pups and stomped off towards the relief complex.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The relief complex was a large building with no windows, like a stadium restroom. Magnus shuffled outside nervously; he hated using the ginger relief room. To him it was like parking in a handicapped spot, but this was the only building he fit in. He tried to limit himself to relief room breaks, especially now that Dan was his master. The thought of another man helping him cum was almost too much to bear, but he knew making a giant mess out in the middle of campus would be even more embarrassing than his punishment earlier.<br />
<br />
Magnus exhaled loudly and closed his eyes. With a deep breath in, he puffed his chest out and walked into the complex. Inside were tall concrete walls with differently sized motorized steel doors. It looked more like a mechanic’s shop than a bathroom. Magnus quietly stomped over to a 30 ft. redhead sitting at a counter. The ginger was wearing glasses and a large black bow tie. He was tapping on an oversized tablet computer and looked up as Magnus approached, giving him a warm smile.<br />
<br />
“Good afternoon, sir. Here for a relief room break?” said the hulk at the desk.<br />
<br />
Magnus stammered, “Y-yes please. One extra large room please.”<br />
<br />
The redhead smirked at the trembling Nordic brute. “Any need for attendants today?”<br />
<br />
“Three. Three please, sir!” Magnus rubbed his growing erection, thinking about the ways the relief room boys were going to get him off.<br />
<br />
“Alright. The attendants have been notified. Please make your way to bay XL-3, three doors to your left and enjoy your stay!” Three large doors to the left of Magnus, a yellow light lit up, signalling that it was reserved and ready to use. Magnus walked towards the room and observed the lights on his way to the stall.<br />
<br />
Each bay had three lights, green, yellow, and red, from left to right. Red meant a room was occupied, while green meant a room was open for use. Magnus walked up to the mechanical gate labeled XL-3 and knocked as light as he could on the door. A loud, metal clang filled the room, making Magnus blush and stop his knocking abruptly.<br />
<br />
The gate to the relief room opened slowly like a garage door. Illuminated within, Magnus laid eyes on the three attendants waiting for him inside. They were all regular sized folk, three young, hairy cubs that stood ready to attend to the shy-looking brute. Magnus stepped inside and sat on the ground, legs spread wide around the three attendants.<br />
<br />
All three attendants wore a tight black bow tie around their thick necks, just like the ginger at the reception desk. They were naked except for tight black briefs they wore as a uniform. <br />
<br />
Two of the attendants were quite young, looking like they just graduated high school! This made sense to Magnus; relief room jobs were as common as fast food jobs. For a job one could get after high school, it paid well and there were quite a few...benefits to be had. The third attendant was older, probably around 25, and seemed to be the leader of the group. After the door closed he spoke up.<br />
<br />
“It is a pleasure to service you, sir. My name is Andre. These two are Logan and Ahmed. Would you like us clothed or naked for your experience today?”<br />
<br />
Magnus blushed, his face and neck going bright red. “N-naked please sirs. Thank you very much!” As big as Magnus was, he was always nervous when addressing those who he deemed to be above him. Unfortunately, for Magnus, that was everyone.<br />
<br />
“As you wish sir. We shall begin.” Andre snapped his fingers and immediately all three of them slid their skimpy briefs down their hairy, muscled legs. Magnus noticed they were wearing the usual plastic chastity device. He knew that every attendant was required to wear one, on and off the job. Possibly even a butt plug as well. It was used as motivation to serve every guest well. If they got a good review, they would get to cum and be sent home for the day with a bonus. <br />
<br />
Magnus envied them slightly, having a simple job like that, serving others. Dan’s face flashed into his head and he suddenly felt bad about the passing thought. He had the most handsome, wonderful man in the world to attend to. Someone who loved him with his entire heart. That was better than being an attendant in a bathroom, how could he even think that?<br />
<br />
The boys all walked over to Magnus and undid his giant quilt, pulling it to the side and folding it up neatly and putting it away in a large closet. They then walked over to the wall were three hoses were dangling. Looking up, Magnus could see a large green industrial tank stored in the ceiling of the room reading LUBE.<br />
<br />
The three squat attendants walked towards Magnus’ cock laying between his splayed legs. Each hose suddenly erupted and coated the huge cock from tip to base in lube. It was warm and aromatic, infused with male pheromones to get everyone rock hard.  Magnus watched the two younger bears spray their hands with lube and then tug on their hoses. They retracted up, into the ceiling for the time being as they started to massage his meat.<br />
<br />
The four warm hands started at the base of his cock, the bears wading into a tangle of platinum pubic hair to massage the giant’s pulsing shaft. Andre finished spraying the tip of his cock and released his hose. He walked over, putting on a sort of show for Magnus, giant muscled rump jiggling with each step. He bent over forwards to pick up a device and showed Magnus his inflated balls and the ovular base of a black plug inserted snugly into his hole.<br />
<br />
Andre walked back with a large vibrating device and started to massage the tip of Magnus’ cock. Magnus moaned loudly, filling the room with a deep lustful noise. He could feel the bears at the base of his cock shudder and squeeze his shaft as he moaned. They worked their way up his sensitive pole to about halfway and started to rub left to right in a rhythmic fashion, like a giant hand jerking the brute off.<br />
<br />
The ebony-skinned man coaxed more and more pre out of Magnus, running the vibrator around his cockhead and nearing his urethra where he was extra sensitive. This made Magnus squirm and buck his hips, a sound like that of a pleasured bull reverberating off the relief room walls. Magnus’ balls chruned and gurgled, overdue for release after the teasing from his brother pups Patrick and Marcus.<br />
<br />
Andre swirled the vibrator around his head some more, dodging the small spasms of pre spraing from the cock he was servicing. The other boys had started rubbing faster and faster, feeling the brute’s cock tense up tighter with each stroke. Magnus moaned in ecstasy as the small bears worked his needy cock.<br />
<br />
Magnus couldn’t hold it in any longer, he had to cum. Without warning, a firehose of cum shot out from the giant’s cock, coating Andre from head to toe and knocking him backwards. Magnus roared as he orgasmed and shot load after load onto the wall and floor in front of him. The two younger bears moaned with him, humping his spasming cock, wanting to get off just as bad as Magnus. After a few minutes of dwindling spurts, Magnus stopped cumming. <br />
<br />
The attendants bowed before Magnus and began cleaning the room up. Large squeegees ran the thick cum to a drain and was then washed with water. Magnus himself was wiped clean and his kilt was put back onto him. In just a few minutes the room looked like it had before Magnus’ massive eruption.<br />
<br />
“We hope you enjoyed your stay, sir. Please come again!” All three attendants bowed again and retrieved their briefs before going into a back room. The large gate opened up and Magnus took a step outside, ready to get back to Dan.</p>
