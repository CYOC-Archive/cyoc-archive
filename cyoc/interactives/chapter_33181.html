<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Picking the bear form hadn't really been the best idea from the point of view of getting information.  The bearmorphs intimidated everyone, predator and prey species alike, and they were usually given a wide berth.  The kind of person who picked the bear form often liked it that way, and except for a clique of gay male &quot;bears&quot; most bearmorphs didn't even socialize with their own kind, let alone the other species.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, though, for Maggie, Jeremy was one of the best-known characters in Transformation park, and when she eventually managed to get someone to talk to her, she found out her son's new status in the park quickly.  But it didn't make sense.  How could he be king of the deer?  He was a nebbish.<br />
<br />
And that paled compared to how Maggie felt when she heard (from the newshounds, who she had been directed to as the best source of information) that some slut, some tranny slut, had seduced her idiot son and was now claiming to be knocked up by him.  Yeah, the contraceptives didn't work.  Right.<br />
<br />
The she-bear lumbered off, determined to rescue her cub.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Maria laughed as she flipped through the options for her change.  It was ironic.  She made her boyfriend Larry promise to be female during his visit to the park, because she thought that was the way to ensure he would be faithful. No chance of Larry going for a guy!  And perhaps being female would give him a few pointers on relating to women.<br />
<br />
But now that she had received an invitation and could join him, did she want to stay female and have a &quot;sisterly&quot; type of relation with her transformed boyfriend, or try being the dominant male?  She was sure he had chosen to be a deer, as they had talked about it before he left and she knew he had kind of a thing for deer--he was the only guy she ever heard of who owned the DVD of Bambi.  What the heck, she thought, this was her one chance to see what it was like to be the guy, and the thought of being the male in lovemaking was definitely a turn-on.  <br />
<br />
OK then, it was just a week anyway.  She hit the &quot;male&quot; and &quot;deer&quot; buttons.<br />
<br />
Maria felt a creepy sensation over her body as new hairs grew in.  Her fingertips hardened into tiny hooves.  But the strangest sensations were coming from her head and groin.  It felt like there was a great weight pressing down on her head.  She raised her new hands, and the hardness of her fingerhoofs brushed the hardness of a magnificent six-point rack.  And down below there was a really nice feeling, as something was growing.  She looked down, and saw that she had a very respectable penis.  Pop!  His testicles appeared.<br />
<br />
Maria the stag went forth into the park.  Now what was the name Larry was going to use as a doe?  Oh yeah, &quot;Leticia.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Jeremy and Leticia were enjoying a warm afternoon alone (Jeremy had driven off all of his underlings, which was easier said than done) when Leticia noticed a she-bear coming directly towards them.  That was definitely odd, as the bears and deer generally ignored each other.  Stranger was the way Jeremy was acting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get away Leticia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to stay with you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not in danger here, but you are.  Please, think of the fawn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think the bear is going to attack?  C'mon, you know that doesn't happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leticia, please go, get the huskies.&quot;  Jeremy introduced the note of command that he employed as master of the herd.  Leticia left.<br />
<br />
Jeremy faced the she-bear.  There wasn't anything he could point to to identify the bear, but at the same time there wasn't much room for doubt in his mind. &quot;M-Mom?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon.&quot; the bear replied.  &quot;You've been here too long.  We're getting out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm staying here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be ridiculous.  You can't throw away your life on this silly fantasy.  Stop playing stag and get back into the real world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, Mom. . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy took a deep breath.  So far this was going the same way every argument he had with his mother went, and they all ended with her getting her way.  But now it wasn't just him, it was Leticia and their fawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, mother, I have responsibilites.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Responsibilities!  To some sleazy sex-change slut!  I won't let you throw your life away.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the first time ever in his dealings with his mother, Jeremy was really angry.  &quot;She's not a slut!  She's a nice girl!  I want to marry her!&quot;<br />
<br />
The newshounds had been discreetly following the new she-bear, figuring that there would be an interesting story.  Their hunch was panning out.  They were being joined by more morphs, including deer curious about what was going on with their leader.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to marry some tranny who isn't even human!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not human either!  What's so great about being human?  You're not human yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon, we're leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy suddenly felt at peace with himself.  He crossed his arms.  &quot;No, mother, you're leaving.  I'm staying here with Leticia, who I love and who I hope will be my wife and raise our child together.&quot;  The stag and the she-bear looked each other in the eye, and it was not the stag that turned away.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't over.&quot; Maggie muttered, as she made her way back to the park exit.<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
It hurt Leticia to be away from Jeremy when he was facing this challenge, but he was right that the fawn had to come first.  That didn't mean she didn't avidly listen when Lateisha brought her the news that Jeremy had won the battle of wills.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said he wanted to marry me?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;His exact words, girl.  Go to him now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leticia was already on her way.</p>
