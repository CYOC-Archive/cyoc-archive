<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you walk toward what you hope is your new room the mistress of the house came around the corner. She was about a couple inches taller than you with the same long blonde hair and blue eyes. Her breasts were a D cup. One of your duties as Christine had been to help her get dressed for fancy occasions many times. You therefore knew that her skin was silky smooth with no hair on her body not even any pubic hair. When she saw you she screamed &quot;MELODY!&quot; and ran up to you and embraced you in a tight hug.<br />
<br />
You were a little confused by this as she shouldn't have had this much of an emotional outburst upon seeing you. She was acting like she hadn't seen you for years. Melody's mother put her hand on the back of your head and kissed your forehead. She then said &quot;Oh Melody, I thought that I'd never see you again. I've missed you terribly my darling princess. Your father doesn't remember you and neither does anybody else. I thought that I might have been going crazy for a time. Then Christine came back and I knew that I wasn't crazy. And now here you are.&quot; She held you out at arms length and continued &quot;You've grown so much since you disappeared seven years ago. Where have you been?&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn't want to break this womans heart by telling her that you weren't her but she did seem to be the only one that knew that Christine had been gone. Making up you're mind you said &quot;I'm sorry but I'm really not your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you are&quot; Melody's mother said smiling. &quot;I would recognize my own daughter even if  hadn't seen her in twenty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I do have your daughter's body&quot; you said getting a little uncomfortable. &quot;It's kind of complicated to explain but I'll try my best. Two months ago I was walking around town and I came across what I assumed was a park. I went inside and followed the path to this mansion. I entered the guest house and walked into the bedroom. There was a mirror there that was cloudy but it cleared. In the mirror I saw Christine and when I looked at myself I had discovered that I had become Christine. I found a maid outfit and put it on. That's when Christine's personality took over and I cleaned the guest house. As soon as I left I remembered who I was and I decided to go along with being a maid in the hopes that I could figure out a way to change back. Now today I went into the storage room to get a replacement for the broken dining chair and I found a mirror like the one in the guest house. It was clear when I looked in it but it soon clouded over. When it cleared I saw Melody and knew I had become her. Melody tried taking over like Christine did but I was ready for it this time. I decided to try to find Melody's room and here we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be&quot; Melody's mother said shaking her head. &quot;You can't have been Christine or someone else. People just don't change like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that it's hard to believe but it's true&quot; you said with a heavy sigh. &quot;If it's any comfort Melody is in here with me but since this was my body first so I should be in control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know if you were Christine you would be able to tell me what happened two weeks ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's easy&quot; you said waving your hand. &quot;Dana was making a dress for you and while she was pinning it up she accidentally scratched you. You told Andrea, Dana, and I not to mention it to the master since he would likely fire Dana. You said that it was an accident and it wasn't a big deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn't have known that if you weren't Christine&quot; Melody's mother said with a look of shock on her face. &quot;So if you changed what happened to Christine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure. She could be back in the mirror in the guest house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or she might be in the mirror in the storage room&quot; Melody's mother said in a thoughtful tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought about that&quot; you admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;When Christine took you over what did you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was thinking that I had gone in to clean the guest house and it did need cleaning. Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Christine disappeared seven years ago. She had gone to the guest house to clean it. She was gone for a long time so I went to check on her. I didn't find her in there. Instead Andrea was cleaning it and she had just started. When I asked her why Christine wasn't cleaning it she didn't know who I was talking about. It was the same thing that happened with you seven years ago today. Nobody remember Christine or you but me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many more do you remember that no one else does?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's just the two of you&quot; Melody's mother said with a confused look on her face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how many mirrors like the one in the storage room and the guest house are there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's only those two&quot; Melody's mother said seeming to become more confused. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
You were starting to put a theory together. You needed more information before your theory would fit together. &quot;I may know what's going on&quot; you said. &quot;I just need to ask some more questions. Were they mirrors a gift for you and Melody?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a matter of fact they were&quot; Melody's mother said with a surprised look on her face. &quot;Do you think that someone wanted me and you out of their way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not Melody so I don't think anyone wanted me out of their way&quot; you said with a slight edge to your voice. &quot;But it looks like they could have wanted you and Melody out of the way. It might explain why you remembered Christine and Melody and nobody else did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll have to get rid of those mirrors to prevent anyone else from becoming a victim of them.&quot; Melody's mother looked at you with sad eyes and said &quot;I'm sorry but it looks like you'll be stuck as my daughter.&quot; She took a deep breath and continued &quot;We can't allow those mirrors to mess up anyone else's life. Even if that means we'll never see Christine again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; you said hanging your head. Someone had wanted to get rid of Melody and her mother for some reason. Since you were transformed you can only guess that they were planning on becoming Melody and her mother. The question now was whether the mirror in the storage room could trap you or Melody's mother since it could be empty now. And what about the one in the guest house?</p>
