<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">3rd Period, and Allison was feeling like she was set to panic. She couldn&#39;t see the altered Kendall anywhere, and she&#39;d checked all the usual places, even including their usual rendezvous point for him. Nowhere. She felt a sense of worry come over her, and on top of it all she was finding herself drifting oddly when she thought about him. Kendall must be changing, she thought, in a way that&#39;s pretty significant. The dark haired nerd was so different this morning. Honestly she KNEW she shouldn&#39;t have let him just wave it off. He was so used to how it operated though that---that...<br />
<br />
What if he just let it happen even more because it &quot;felt good in the moment&quot;? He always did have a problem with that, a flaw in the wall of his logical mindset.<br />
<br />
She sighed, and happened as she left the library area to bump into Wes, who was himself thinking about his experiences with the changes and Bryan - Bryan&#39;s ease settling into life as one of the Jansens, the temptation to just let himself give and enjoy it. After all, it was sure pretty nice having such a relationship with Bryan. Then he found himself looking at a significantly worried Allison. Her hair disorderly and her face streaked with sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison?&quot; Wes asked, concerned immediately. He wondered if this was his karma for settling into it so early. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Did something happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Kendall. I can&#39;t find him!&quot; Allison admitted, looking around and wiping off her forehead. Again she felt herself drifting it seemed, but she bit her lip hard enough to force herself to concentrate. Fingers gripped hard against the skin of her palms. She could not let herself be distracted by whatever changes were going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;He...usually has third period off, right?&quot; Wes asked, crossing his arms, &quot;Maybe he&#39;s just...no. I was just done at the gym. I didn&#39;t see him anywhere there...&quot; This was a headache. Wes admitted that as much as he honestly did want to just let himself enjoy what the changes were doing, this reinforced why that really wasn&#39;t an entirely good option. Allison was having her relationship strained and torn by this change Kendall was going through.<br />
<br />
And while it seemed initially like he was not undergoing any sort of sexuality alteration, maybe there WAS something going on there. The way it seemed Kendall conducted himself around Alex Clark. Maybe both had been seeing things, but Wes knew when he saw a guy getting affected by another guy. And it seemed like Kendall&#39;s eye was wavering a bit. Not overwhelmingly so, it seemed to be proceeding quite slowly this time in regards to sexuality.<br />
<br />
The two were distracted however when a pair of students walked by, discussing something they had seen. &quot;Hey, did you see the new groundskeeper? Dude&#39;s fucking jacked!&quot; &quot;Honestly, good on him for defying the creepy groundskeeper stereotype. He&#39;s in awesome shape for a man in his thirties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison briefly gulped and then managed to calm herself down, even though internally her reaction could best be described as a storm of emotions, &quot;Hey. Do you two know uh, where this groundskeeper is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he just got done doing something out there and was heading back in to the groundskeeper&#39;s office.&quot; One of them said, seemingly a little confused by the twitch and urgency that was visible in Allison&#39;s voice. With that, she quickly rushed off, leaving Wes standing there, watching and realizing what she had put together a moment too late to really pursue her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison, wait, you don&#39;t know if---dammit!&quot; Wes sighed, and shrugged his shoulders. He knew something - one way or another - was going to be happening with those two today. And chances were, it wasn&#39;t gonna be anything good for Allison. Wes decided if she needed someone to talk to, well, he was there for her. He was one of the few others to know about what was going on there, after all. And it was obvious what was going on was not agreeing with her.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Allison walked up to the groundskeeper&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
It was pretty well kept and distanced from the main campus, and it looked like some duties were just completed here. Someone had put some stuff away. There was only one real way to find out if the ripped groundskeeper those two had talked about really was who she feared it was. And that was to move forward. Something told her she was being foolish. Something tempted her to just walk away, choose another boyfriend and let things move on. But that was not the kind of girl Allison was. She didn&#39;t roll over to anything or anyone. She fought, she thought, and somehow she&#39;d win.<br />
<br />
Knock.<br />
Knock.<br />
Knock.<br />
Knock.<br />
<br />
The sound of her fist against the wood of the door rang loudly through the interior. At first it seemed like nothing was happening. Nobody seemed home. Allison looked down, wondering if this was all some gigantic mistake. What if it wasn&#39;t even Kendall? What if it was some guy who had just joined the school staff today and who was just trying to get his job done? Wouldn&#39;t she be making a gargantuan fool of herself, going out of her way like this...?<br />
<br />
The sound of feet proceeding up to the door jarred her out of her doubts. Heavy feet. Whoever this was was indeed quite large. She gulped, and stood ready, almost ramrod straight in front of the door. It opened up, letting out a burst of warm air and...there he was. Dressed up in his overalls, his powerfully built bodybuilder physique jutting out like nothing she&#39;d ever seen from him before. Muscle just...on top of muscle. At some point, he&#39;d removed his tank top shirt, thus giving her an even greater view of his body.<br />
<br />
She knew she needed to worry, to ask, to find out what was going on. But she couldn&#39;t help feeling attracted to this man, standing here before her. He spoke before she had the chance to, &quot;...Allison? How&#39;d you find me all the way out here? I uh, just got done doing a bit of work that Coach Mason needed done. He got me some money for it, and I got to work my body---&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison ran forward and hugged him. Even with the slight alterations in his tastes and such, Kendall realized Allison felt relieved and affectionate in the moment. He lightly returned the hug, and said, &quot;Babe?&quot; He moved with her into the groundskeeper&#39;s place, knowing she probably wanted to talk in private. She seemed so emotional upon seeing him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was so worried you&#39;d completely changed or something...I missed you.&quot; What did make Kendall doubletake was when Allison then kissed him square on the lips. His libido roared to life as she put a bit too much passion into it, Kendall knowing despite this somehow that he was indeed not quite the teen he was before. She was eighteen, but the fact was...<br />
<br />
He was really feeling this groundskeeper thing. Way more than he felt being a student any longer. It just naturally connected with his body, his state of being, his mental state. And he knew well enough that the groundskeeper sleeping with the head cheerleader would not look good on either of them. Socially especially. Kendall pulled back a bit, &quot;I get why you did that, but we&#39;re gonna have to be more careful if you REALLY want to be with me. Listen, Allison, look at my body, my face. I&#39;m an older man now.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded and looked, really taking in how mature and DIFFERENT he was. Kendall really was older. He didn&#39;t just look older. He WAS older. And she could tell why that strange drifting feeling earlier was happening. It must&#39;ve been the wish, making her feel like just moving on into the new state of being at the school. But Allison, ever the stubborn girl, looked at Kendall, &quot;Older&#39;s...older&#39;s fine, Kendall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you want your social status.&quot; He retorted, &quot;We can&#39;t be banging all over the place rampantly. I&#39;m like, 35 or something. If we got discovered, it would be a huge scandal. I could lose my place here whatever it ends up being. Are you absolutely sure you want to have sex with me? Me, instead of a guy like say, Dylan Spence, who&#39;s more your speed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison nodded repeatedly, and watched as Kendall walked over to close the door. &quot;Alright, for now, fine. We&#39;ll have to redo how often we do these kinds of things,&quot; He said, &quot;It&#39;ll be rarer. Lots rarer. Today might be our only time this week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison gulped and decided even if the groundskeeper&#39;s office was not exactly as clean and nice to enjoy during sexual congress, she was just happy that, for now, she still had Kendall. Allison started removing her clothes, and her eyes were caught by Kendall&#39;s powerfully built, incredibly muscular frame, well toned, honed and trained like one of those gladiators from that tv show. Him removing his overalls left him standing there in a pair of tightly fitted black boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You like?&quot; He said somewhat teasingly, &quot;How about you kiss whatever muscles you like most?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall found it rather oddly thrilling as Allison moved forward without much further banter and started licking and kissing his body, dragging her tongue over his well toned biceps, pinching his triceps, making him gasp as he felt her lips wrap around his small but sensitive nipples, and grinned as he watched her start kissing each of his abdominals down toward his manhood. Sure his tastes today seemed different, but for now at least he was still very much into his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Even if their relationship had changed significantly due to Allison&#39;s determination.<br />
<br />
By the time Allison had his manhood out, Kendall groaned and flexed his shoulders as he felt her licking his cock from head to base. &quot;Easily,&quot; she said looking up at him, &quot;One of my favorite of your muscles.&quot; She kept doing that, kept teasing him, and Kendall wanted to chide her for teasing an older man that much. He hoped if she made him cum too soon he could easily get it back up. Fuck, but he was really loving this a little too much.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile.<br />
<br />
Coach Mason found himself a voyeur. The muscular, increasingly youthful and virile coach didn&#39;t even notice his age of 28 slip down to 26, his hair thickening further on his head and his muscles growing a bit more toned still as he felt his manhood grow hard and enticed in his pants. The tumescence was surprising, but then Coach Mason had been resolutely enjoying himself. He couldn&#39;t exactly not notice that his romantic tastes were becoming a bit well, gayer, but if liking men a bit was the cost for getting so young, strong and virile again, well, Coach Mason was good with paying that cost.<br />
<br />
He wondered if he might end up the same age as his pupils... Wouldn&#39;t that be something? Trying to coach his team while being not even a year their senior. Mason found himself admitting as he watched the sexual encounter go on between Allison the sexy and intelligent eighteen year old cheerleader and Kendall the---however old he ended up being, that no thought of halting the congress going on or trying to inform on them was occurring in his mind.<br />
<br />
Mason&#39;s manhood was pulsing in his pants. He needed to get off pretty soon or he&#39;d get a pretty bad case of the blue balls. Now, sure, he could just go ahead and rub one out while watching those two lovebirds have their little date out here, or he could try and join in and make this a menage a tres... That latter option was what made Mason&#39;s dick pulse the most, and right now he was inclined toward going that direction, but he also worried they wouldn&#39;t be open to it.</p>
