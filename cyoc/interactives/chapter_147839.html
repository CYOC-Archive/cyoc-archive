<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were an old man, 86 years old, and you were struggling with a terminal illness after a heart-attack. Your entire family had shown up to be with you in your final moments of life. Your wife, Charlotte, was on your left, to your right was your son and daughter with their lovers, and to their sides were your 5 grandchildren. You desperately clung to life and hugged your newly born grandson expecting all life to flee from your body at any moment, but suddenly the exact opposite happened. A surge of livelihood like a second wind coursed through your veins, and you felt like god&#39;s hand reached down and gifted you with a miracle. You even watched as your wrinkles were disappearing, and your fingers looked... feminine?<br />
<br />
You thought you were hallucinating, your family was unsure if you had dementia or not, but at this point you thought you were going crazy. That’s when you noticed your wife, and the grandchildren screaming while your son and daughter tried to calm everyone down. That’s when you noticed two orbs form on your chest, and you felt a sensation in your pelvis that could be only described as something pulling your penis inside of you. Then when you reached down you felt nothing but an open slit, and from then a stimulating lust shot throughout your body and you entered some sort of sexual frenzy. <br />
<br />
You started rubbing your growing chest, and toying with the sacks of sensitive flesh, as well as penetrating your open slit with two fingers. You barely even noticed what other changes ensued throughout the experience, but all that you knew at this point was that you felt young again, and at this stage in your life you had no regrets. So you embraced this insatiable lust as your body underwent massive changes, and ultimately everything went black around you right as you were expecting to see a light.<br />
<br />
You woke up later, and the moment you saw your hand covered in magenta scales you screamed as loud as you could. But just the sound of your voice alone was enough to send chills down your spine. It wasn’t your own voice, but the voice of a young woman maybe in her early to mid-twenties. You looked down at your body and saw something worse, two ample EE cup breasts that you cupped in each hand, and a plump wet slit between your legs where your dick was. Your hands were no longer your own, but claws with three fingers and a thumb, and your feet were large three toed claws. <br />
<br />
What’s more was that your heart monitor was knocked over by two large wings that have grown out from your shoulders. The electrodes on your chest had detached from your scales, and peering down further you saw a large tail beneath your pelvis. You then noticed the mess covering your inner thighs, tail, and slit and figured that it was just your bladder at first. However you had no bladder issues, and the smell reminded of when you and your wife conceived your children.<br />
<br />
Wait, your wife, children, grandchildren?! Where were they?! In a desperate and panicked state you started screamed as loud as you could only to have a spiral of fire ignite the wall across from you in flames. Moments later some sort of wingless blue scaled reptile with a white mane rushed in and exhaled a breath that put out the flames, and covered the wall in a thick layer of ice. You started freaking out even more when she rushed up to you, and you were struggling to remove your IV bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the hell off of me demon! Just let me die in piece in this hell!&quot; You screamed, figuring that there had to be no other place for you to be right now considering what just happened. The creature grabbed your arm and pulled it away from your other restrained one connected to the IV bag, and you fought back with all your might. Then the creature froze your arm to the other side of the hospital bed and turned your face towards hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Just let me spend my afterlife in peace, you unholy hell-spawn of...&quot; You began then the creature shouted,&quot;Gene! It’s me, Charlotte, you’re not dead, you’re alive! Please calm down, and come to your senses!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes widened and you looked to see that this maned reptile had tears in her eyes, and... her eyes they were slitted but they were familiar. You recognized those eyes as the eyes of your lover and you started tearing up yourself, and started crying as you whimpered,&quot;I-I&#39;m... s-sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte kissed you after that and it felt like the days when you were young again, but as she stopped a grim thought popped into your mind and you asked,&quot;W-What happened?! Charlotte, our kids, our grandkids are they alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte blushed and she looked towards the door and called out,&quot;It’s... time to show her... better now than never.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then your eyes widened as you watched your family re-enter the room, and your heart dropped. All of them were female, you had to ask each of them who they were. Your son&#39;s wife was now a feathered phoenix, and your daughter&#39;s new wife was some sort of six tailed fox. But the most shocking aspect was that your kin were all younger, drastically younger. Your own children appeared to be teenagers, and your grandchildren were all mixed between their regular age or infants now. You couldn’t believe your eyes, much less what came up on the news moments later, and it seemed that a new chapter had opened in your lives.<br />
<br />
_________<br />
<br />
A few months later you at least imagine that things grew into a new sort of normal. All of your family took un new names after they changed, and there seemed to be a little community now inside the hospital. It turned out that the majority of your family was dragons now, and they aged extremely slow. You weren’t quite sure how long you had left, but according to your daughter each century was basically like a year for dragons. Your daughter always had odd information about myths and legends, especially since she was a fantasy story author, and her former husband was an artist. That only begged the question of why you weren’t even younger, but you the government was now no more and someone had to take charge. Your former son brought that up since she was more logical, and specialized in engineering and her wife was a teacher by trade.<br />
<br />
You served as a lieutenant in Vietnam before all of this, so you decided to take charge and speak to some of the higher ups in the hospital staff. Many of them were skeptical with many of your claims and your age, but when they looked into your medical record they started believing you. So they all decided to form some sort of governing body, and appoint you in charge of supplies as a quartermaster which you had some experience with during the war. A few other military members joined up and decided to form a council with the medical staff like a legislative or judicial branch, where they appointed people to help enforce most of the basic laws present before the collapse.<br />
<br />
With that taken care of you turned to your family now, considering everyone had to adjust to new living situations. Your former son is now named Dahlia, and she almost looked like she was 14 years old. Her wife turned phoenix stayed, but vowed to never do anything sexual until Dahlia could at least be categorized as an adult. Angela looked 16, and her wife did the same, and also discovered ways she could use magic to make even herself younger for comfort. While you weren’t sure about Angela&#39;s situation, you felt confident that everything was under control now, which was still uncomfortable considering four of your grandchildren are infants now, leaving only your 4 year old kitsune granddaughter at her normal age.<br />
<br />
Your wife also seemed to possess some magical influence, so she experimented around with her free time and figured out that she could put enchantments on nearly anything that she wanted to. It was really interesting when you watched your wife turn some surgical scissors into some jewelry for you and her. Then again you still weren’t comfortable with anything that was happening, but... you both couldn’t help but feel a flame rekindle between you two. <br />
<br />
One night you gave into your sexual desires when you felt a burning heat in your groin, and it was heavenly. You and Charlotte now were just filled with passion for each other, though she always seemed yo be a step ahead of you in the bed. At night you both would sometimes go on a tryst, which involved lots of intimate love. You still remember when she showed you it felt to have a breast massaged, and someone eat out your clit. You were overjoyed to know that the change in gender didn’t do anything but make your bond grow as oddly as it seemed. Each night you both went out got even kinkier than the last, and you began to wonder if you would even be fine with having another child.<br />
<br />
__<br />
<br />
It had been a few days since your last date with your wife, and everything had been running rather smoothly. You woke up today and felt groggier than usually and sighed, kissing your wife before getting up out of bed. Half of the hospital was basically an apartment complex now, you and your wife had one room to yourselves with two beds pushed together. Your daughters had their own rooms, but each had an extra as a nursery for their young ones, and a partial daycare when it came to Dahlia&#39;s wife, Cindy. It was also kind of cute how your family worked it’s way into society now, Angela read to kids at Cindy’s daycare and sometimes Angela’s wife, Sam, made art for the kids.<br />
<br />
You grabbed a cup to get some water, and as you walked out you sighed and stood in front of a mirror on the wall. That’s when....</p>
