<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You cry out in pain as every inch of your body begins burning, and you fall down onto all fours. "P...Please...!!" You screamed but a series of cracks and breaking sounds like bones interrupted you.<br />
<br />
Your legs shifted and your spine cracked forcing you into a permanent quadrupedal stance. Out in front of your face you could see your mouth push out into a muzzle, your teeth grew sharper, your tongue forked, and your eyes and nostrils became reptilian slits. Moments later your hair fell out, and your ears shifted into what appeared to look like fins, and horns protruded out of the back of your skull and extended outwards straight back.<br />
<br />
You then screamed again as your neck spontaneously extended outwards, and out of the corner of your eye you noticed that your hands and feet had taken a change too. In fact, your hands and feet all looked like claws with four digits, all digitigrade and thumbless. It was then your body expanded all around and stretched itself, stopping once your head hit the ceiling of the cave, your neck stretching out about half your body length.<br />
<br />
You then felt a painful pressure at the base of your spine and screamed as a large tail pushed out right above your asshole. Your did the same as two nubs pushed out of your shoulders and formed complete wings each stretching twice your body length as your skin stretched to form the flaps. It was then you suddenly felt a huge surge of pleasure instead of pain, and you looked down to see your cock fully erect in all of its masculinity. However your chest felt sensitive, and you noticed multiple soft areas of flesh form across it and expand  around your existing nipples, and forming nipples of their own.<br />
<br />
While this happened you felt extreme urges of pleasure as if you were having very kinky sex right now, and you screamed out once more, but this time it sounded like a roar as you suddenly orgasmed, but this wasn’t any normal orgasm. When you orgasmed your cock releases it’s seed, but there was a lot more than It your body should be able to output all at once. It was then you noticed your cock shriveling up underneath your body, and into a slick feminine slit. <br />
<br />
You roared, flames shooting out of your maw as you again orgasmed, your cock becoming nothing and but a new slit was now dripping of both your male cum, and female juices. When you orgasmed the nubs on your chest and those flesh sacks filled up to massive proportions with some sort of liquid, and your nipples leacked it. It was then you realized that it was milk, and the sacks on your chest were in fact six massive breasts, and each had to be the size of a minivan at least.<br />
<br />
Finally you saw glistening iridescent scales form everywhere on your body, your wing flaps turned the same color, and your teats turned an aquamarine color as your breasts were covered with scales, and your clit felt even more sensitive and needy than before.<br />
<br />
"Congratulations, for you this should be an honor now my dear." The voice said<br />
<br />
"Huh? Wh....What d..do...m...mean?" You hesitated and studdered as new and unexplainable feelings of submission overwhelmed your instincts as the pain went away.<br />
<br />
The voice begins chuckling then says,"Why, to mother my son’s eggs of course. You will free him, now!"<br />
<br />
The voice roared in your head and you whimpered and tried running, but your body began moving on it’s own towards the sword. You picked up the sword in your maw against your will, and knocked over the chalice with your tail. You then dropped the sword and broke it over the spilled contents of the chalice and the liquid began glowing.<br />
<br />
You whimpered again trying to run, but your body again refused to respond then you cried out,"Why are you doing this to me?! Please, I don’t want any of this!!" The voice gave no response, but then you saw a blinding red light shine from where you smashed the sword. Then there was a new voice,"From tha shattered sword of imprisonment, the blade becomes my body. From the blood of the many who died before me, let it be mine and let their legacy pass on with my own."<br />
<br />
You shielded your eyes from the light as you saw a figure emerge from it, and you shuddered as you saw a large and muscular black and red scaled dragon. Your body compared to his was dainty and frail, but you felt attracted by this as you stared at his muscles throughout his body. The dragon then opened its eyes and looked at you, and you shuddered and scurried back against a corner wall feeling both fear and attraction towards this large beast. The dragon then walked towards you slowly, and you covered your body with your wings and covered your head underneath your claws afraid for your life as you as tears began flowing from your eyes.<br />
<br />
You then suddenly felt a touch that felt gentle and calming, and it stroked your wing and scales. You peaked out from underneath your claws and wing to see the dragon stroking you calmly, and with concern. "It’s okay, it’s okay miss, I won’t harm you. I will only continue until you’re calm enough to have a conversation with me." The dragon said in a voice sounding almost like one of a fairytale prince, or so you imagine. You paused afterwards blushing a bit uncovering yourself slowly and cautiously.<br />
<br />
You then looked the dragon in the eyes and he looked back into yours and smiled. "There’s that sweet and innocent face of yours. A beauteous iridecent maiden like yourself must have been through a lot to finally free me. So tell me, who are you? And how many of us dragons remain?"<br />
<br />
You just stare at him and let out a series of murmurs as you almost find yourself trembling at those questions. The dragon narrows it’s vision and peers closely at your then sighs,"I see....so Dad’s tinkering actually probed useful. Which means that you either have no knowledge of, or we are the only two left, aren’t we? This....this is just....shattering." He says with a slight whimper in his voice.<br />
<br />
"H....How did you....know?" You whimpered now looking at him with a sadder expression, and sniffle a bit.<br />
<br />
He looks back at you and says,"Your expression was that of fear and confusion, hence your instincts first taking effect on your body. They’re....intense aren’t they? You fear what you don’t understand either, a natural thing to feel. So, am I right to assume you were a human? An explorer who wandered here in venture of treasure?"<br />
<br />
You paused before giving a slight nod, then you said,"I wouldn’t exactly say for treasure, I mean some do, but I was just curious. Now considering what I am...I feel....lost, but kind of attracted to you in a way. Damn having breasts is so weird, and that emptiness is going to haunt me." You shuddered a but as you looked down, then you looked up blushing as the dragon had seen those things already.<br />
<br />
"Why yes, you were a male before weren’t you? But aren’t they lovely? Such wonderful things that give lives to many cannot be any less exemplary as yours. Just as nothing much compares to what lies in my sheath to other males." The dragon said and you blushed heavily.<br />
<br />
"E...exemplary? I...I don’t want to have these th....though, a.....and my..." You began then blushed as tears again formed in your eyes.<br />
<br />
The dragon frowned then sat down in front of you and licked your face clean of your tears then said,"I know they aren’t the most ideal things for you to want since you were male. But please let me help you with them, and show you how incredible it can feel to raise young."<br />
<br />
You whimpered more looking the dragon in the eyes then you said,"I...I don’t want to....raise kids.....or lay eggs or..."<br />
<br />
The dragon shushed you by putting his muzzle up against yours then said,"I assure you that we won’t be taking care of any clutches from your lovely body. But you must understand that eggs get layed no matter what, and naturally at that. I’ve had multiple females cater to me and a harem to bear my seed over multiple clutches.<br />
Unfortunately those eggs all died off and my legacy is no more. But we can rebuild and right the wrongs of this world,and if not us our royal kin."<br />
<br />
You paused then gave the dragon a puzzled look and asked,"R...Royal?"<br />
<br />
The dragon hesitated for a moment then smacked himself in the head then said,"Ah! Damn me! Apologies for my lack of manners, but I am Prince Zulian the eleventh, and to whom do I have the honor to call my mate?"<br />
<br />
You paused blushing then told Zulian your name and he nodded then sighed then said,"Apologies again for my reaction, but I keep forgetting that you were once a feeble human heh. I think that we should give you a proper name from our culture. Hmmm....I got it, Urilia, that’s who you will be known as."<br />
<br />
You paused then asked,"Urilia? Why that?"<br />
<br />
"It means mother of many generations of royalty. I know that you don’t wish to breed, but I will do everything in my power to help you become willing to do so." Zulian said<br />
<br />
"I..uh just...hurgh! Oof! What’s thaunnn!" You growled feeling something solid push itself up to your pussy.<br />
<br />
"Oh I see your natural body is laying its first egg, don’t worry they’re not large starting off. But it helps you prepare for impending motherhood." Zulian said<br />
<br />
"Wh....what?!" You shouted then growled as something round pushed itself out of your vagina and plopped onto the ground, and you heard a cracking sound. <br />
<br />
"You should practice like this since it happens daily, just when you are pregnant, don’t do this standing up like you are." Zulian said and you groaned again then you pushed out another egg, then another until you finally stopped.<br />
<br />
You didn’t like pushing out eggs, but the feeling turned you on in a way. Actually it made you feel a bit horny to do it again. "Alright, twelve eggs, that’s about clutch size. You okay there?" Zulian asked<br />
<br />
"Yeah, but...heh...I’m kind of turned on now. Is that natural for me to feel horny after this?" You asked<br />
<br />
"Of course, and once you’re pregnant it will feel even more glorious to push out full sized ones. But for now, let me show you the proper way to end something like this." Zulian said then you nodded and sat down where you were.<br />
<br />
Zulian walked up then nuzzled you for reassurance then took hold of one of your sensitive nipples and began sucking. Your body went wild suddenly and you moaned, and found yourself penetrating your clit with your own tail. Eventually Zulian drew milk from you then stopped and looked at you smiling,"That a girl, you’re doing wonderfully for the first time, and your coping with your tail is exactly how this is done instinctively."<br />
<br />
"Wh...why did you do that?" You asked breathing heavily <br />
<br />
"To make you more comfortable, if these things swell up too much then It isn’t fun for anyone. They do that every time you push an egg out, so I help by sucking out any excess milk. That’s about the only one that looked bigger than the rest." Zulian said<br />
<br />
"Wh...what now?" You asked breathing heavily, sill penetrating yourself with your tail.<br />
<br />
"Wow, you are needy aren’t you? Even for one who wishes not for motherhood. Tell you what, I’ll gather some trees and build us a nice and big nest, then hunt. You just stay here and figure out your body, is that alright my love?" Zulian asked<br />
<br />
You nodded then paused and shrieked,"L..Love?!"<br />
<br />
Zulian nodded then nuzzled your cheek and said,"Of course, and you make me feel so happy. You may not know it but you are the most attractive dragoness I’ve seen in all of my life, and we don’t age past prime. I’ve had harems and woman after woman, but not one of them matches your beauty and your body is worthy enough to be more than an addition to any harem. Urilia, you deserve to be my wife, and nothing less. In addition I can teach you everything about our culture in whole. So just relax, and do what you will around here, I will return for you."<br />
<br />
You nodded blushing as Zulian left the cave then thought to yourself,"Is this a punishment?"<br />
<br />
