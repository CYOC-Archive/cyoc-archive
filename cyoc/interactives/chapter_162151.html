<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mallory told Andrew to feel home. She quickly went to her bedroom to lay over her coat and purse, came back, and offered him a brewsky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can you open it, with your teeth, as men do?&quot;, Mallory asked. Her eyes had a very clear teasing spark. Andrew was feeling that spark down there burning up to a real flame. He was nervous...it was the first time that the thought of sex with another woman was so imminent to actually become a reality. He felt the erection and trying to somehow subvert it was not going well for him. What would a man do? A man would &quot;own it&quot; he thought to himself. That&#39;s when he spread one leg apart from the other mildly and simply let his bulge visible. As the blood in his veins circulated normally, he could feel confidence-boosting up. In a matter of seconds, he took the beer to his mouth and used his back teeth to open it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must confess this is a very tricky surprise,&quot; Mallory said as she walked down to her couch. Andrew slowly walked behind her tasting a sip of the beer. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humm...&quot; she giggled. As nervous as he was. Although Andrew was quickly learning that the cooler and in control he seemed the more excited she seemed to become. &quot;Do you still want to feel them?&quot;, she asked referencing the conversation about her breasts at dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me think&quot;, Andrew joked, taking a hand to his goatee and scratching it as if thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know my father had one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;A goatee&quot;, she said. She leaned over the couch and pulled his hand making him sit by her side. &quot;I guess I associate a man with one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would love to be your daddy for tonight&quot;, Andrew answered. She took his beer and placed it on the coffee table; Andrew owned it up once again and opened his arms. When Mallory turned around she drew her arms over his neck and dug her lips in his. They shared a lascivious kiss. Andrew could feel her squirm on his lap, moaning gently and her hands were trembling. With this new body, Andrew felt power like never before.<br />
<br />
Mallory bit his earlobe as he grope her ass feeling her cheeks. Her fingers unbuttoned his shirt putting on display his pectoral muscles, covered by a sheet of short chest hair. He took off her shirt and her bra. He felt a jolt with the sight of Mallory&#39;s boobs. No woder men only thought about sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring them to daddy&quot;<br />
<br />
She climbed over himself and he took one of her nipples into his mouth, suckling it. She was in ecstasy feeling his teeth nibbling her -  tiny pains that contrasted with the touch of his rugged men&#39;s hands around her body, feeling her and helping her out of her pants and panties.<br />
<br />
Without saying a word, Andrew stopped; he put a hand on her shoulder and pushed it down. She responded. Mallory kneeled down between his opened legs and took off his jeans pants. Andrew just loved how she was so willing to fulfill his sexual desire. It was a feeling he never could have known as Andrea. Mallory eagerly unbuttoned him and exposed his briefs, drenched in precum. She pulled out his manhood and served herself.<br />
<br />
With no signs that it was arriving Andrew groaned when he felt the interior of her mouth. He looked down at Mallory. Her petite perfect head, once one of her best girlfriends contrasted so much with his muscley tighs, his big hands, and hairy body. He felt he had immense power over her; and the best of it all, she was genuinely enjoying pleasuring him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, wants you to flavor it all&quot;, he whispered placing a hand in the back of her head and making her slide until her nose meshed with his bush. &quot;Inhale it. Feel the scent of the man who&#39;s taking you!&quot;<br />
<br />
He could feel her throat arranging to his manhood. She was having some difficulties but she was so willing to. That even made his heart pump faster.<br />
<br />
He pulled her over to the couch. And she panted for air, he placed her with her breasts over the couch&#39;s headstand and opened her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it, Andrew. Make me your bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure&quot; he grunted. Seeing her exposed like that, with her ass perked and her womanhood winking he didn&#39;t even hesitate. He penetrated her, all in once. Mallory moaned loudly; he started to thrust her. His last civilized thought before fully give in to the animalistic male behavior he remembered how women didn&#39;t like it when the thrust was too fast. So he took it slowly...enjoying every moaning of Mallory, accompanied by his semi-controlled groans. <br />
<br />
As he felt his orgasm coming by he started to pound her. The hot and wet of her inside and the quick fresh of air on his member was a sensation he&#39;d never had thought in a million years he&#39;d enjoy so much. Mallory&#39;s moans were in a crescendo; Andrew started to feel her breasts as he was reaching climax. He laid his face in her neck, scratching it with his goatee and whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my bitch, Mallory!&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he felt it. The orgasm.</p>
