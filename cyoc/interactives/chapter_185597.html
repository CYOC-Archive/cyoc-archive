<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren was a young man of 16. He was 5’8”, with short blonde hair, and an average build. His cute face and charisma made him a somewhat popular guy. His high school peers had already gotten over the shock of him coming out as gay a couple of years ago, but he was still disappointed to be one of the only openly gay people at his high school. <br />
<br />
One day, Darren discovered a shop in the downtown area of his home town. The weird thing was, he couldn’t remember this shop ever existing before. In fact, he could have sword that the two buildings between which this little shop was sandwiched had previously been right next to each other. Curiosity got the better of him and he entered the mysterious space.<br />
<br />
Despite it being noon on a Sunday, there were no other patrons in the shop. It was almost as if the shop had appeared to Darren and not to anyone else. There was, however, an employee. A balding man in his fifties was covered head to toe in rainbow bracelets, necklaces, and clothes.<br />
<br />
“Good afternoon my young fag!” The man greeted Darren. There was no malice in his voice.<br />
<br />
“That obvious, huh?” Asked Darren, “And even without being decked out in rainbow?”<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say it takes one to know one. I’m Billy, I’ll be here if you have any questions about our products or just life. You’re in a safe space,” said Billy.<br />
<br />
Darren felt oddly reassured. That feeling didn’t last long as he started to read different products on the shelves. There were costumes that turn you into celebrities, spray that made people avoid you, a megaphone that could copy any voice. At least that’s what these products claimed to do. Oddly, none of these products had prices indicated anywhere. Though that was the least strange thing about them.<br />
<br />
Billy could see that Darren didn’t believe in the magic of these items, “Ah, I see we have a skeptic. That’s perfectly fine. If you believed everything you read you wouldn’t be the bright young man that you so clearly are. How about a demonstration? I have just the product for a man like yourself.”<br />
<br />
“I guess if you can prove that any of these things work then I don’t have to feel gullible for checking them out,” Darren said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
“Very reasonable. I have here the Sexuality Tablet. This nifty gadget can read and alter the sexualities of anyone,” said Billy.<br />
<br />
“It just looks like a piece of glass,” said Darren. It was true. Billy was holding a piece of glass which was about the length and width of smartphone, but with much thinner thickness.<br />
<br />
Rather than rebut, Billy pointed the glass at Darren and tapped the screen. The glass suddenly had text on it, with details and change options.<br />
<br />
Darren read his stats: “Attracted to men 15+ Fetishes: none...” etcetera.<br />
<br />
“Wow that’s me! It got everything right,” said Darren.<br />
<br />
“But of course. It would be a simple matter to make you straight with a few keystrokes. But why would I do that? These choices can all be yours if you take it home with you. Perhaps a demonstration on someone who isn’t you. Here, try it out on that man outside,” said Billy, referencing someone they could see through the shop windows.<br />
<br />
Just outside of the shop a business man in a suit was leaned against a post checking out a sixteen year old girl who was talking to her boyfriend. He was looking down at her ass because of her form fitting athletic wear. Darren pressed the “new subject” button and the glass went blank he then pointed the glass towards the man, concentrated, and put a finger on the glass.<br />
<br />
“Gaven Poltenheit: 39 years old. Married to Aly Poltenheit, 36. Attracted to women 16+...” etcetera.<br />
<br />
Darren clicked the screen where it said women and the word became highlighted. A keyboard came up at the bottom of the glass and Darren typed “men”. Hitting submit the word men was no longer highlighted. Instantly Darren saw the man lose interest in the girl he was checking out. However, as soon as a male jogger started to pass Gaven, Gaven was now watching the male joggers ass bounce with each bound. He adjusted his boner and his face became flushed. He was clearly embarrassed to be turned on by a man.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that’s incredible!” Darren almost shouted, “But what about his wife?”<br />
<br />
“Well, they’ll probably end up getting a divorce. He was out ogling teenage girls anyway. But if it bothers you, you can change him back any time you have his profile loaded up,” said Billy.<br />
<br />
Darren decided to leave the man gay. There weren’t enough gay people in the first place in his opinion.<br />
<br />
“This is amazing, but there’s no way I could afford something like this on my allowance,” said Darren, handing the glass back to Billy.<br />
<br />
“Oh, we don’t take money here. You see, Darren, me and the others who run this shops are what your kind call fae, or faeries. Our breed specifically thrives off of the joy of humans. We’re not parasitic, the joy doesn’t leave you or anything, it simple makes us stronger when help someone experience great joy. So the ‘cost’ of taking one of these magical objects is simply to have fun with it. It’s what we call a win-win,” explained the fairy.<br />
<br />
“How could I not believe you after what I’ve seen today? Okay, I’ll take it!” Said Darren, who wasn’t the least bit concerned about the fact that he was conversing with a non-human.<br />
<br />
“I like you Darren. You don’t have the same preconceived notions about our kind that so many of your people do. There’s one more thing about this tablet,” said Billy. He suddenly and full forcedly through the rectangular piece of glass straight down at the hard shop floor. Darren was shocked but noticed that tablet didn’t have a single crack.<br />
<br />
“It’s Indestructible. Have fun, Darren!” Said Billy, handing him the tablet.<br />
<br />
The next thing Darren knew, he was  outside right next to that Gaven man, who’s sexuality he had altered. The shop appeared to be gone, and the two shops it had been sandwiched between were back to being side by side. For fun, Darren pretended to drop the tablet. He bent down to pick it up and turned his head to see Gaven checking out his ass. Having this tablet was gonna be so much fun.</p>
