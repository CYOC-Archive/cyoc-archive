<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>And Leopold gets the shaft again!  Sorry...  In other news, I've decided a currency for this universe!  It's the D&D Currency of copper pieces, or cp, silver pieces, or sp, and gold pieces, or gp.  But, I'm changing the values of them.  1gp = 100sp, and 1sp = 100cp.  It's simple and easy to understand.  Think of copper as cents, silver as dollars, and gold as a lot of money.  The average monthly salary for a person is 5 - 10 silver pieces in a month.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The crisp, cool morning air felt wonderful.  As the month was approaching winter, people started buying more food.  The winters in Kelper were quite harsh, as it is a northern, mountainous kingdom.  However, with programs the old king created, the winters were bearable.  Rowan, the new king, kept these programs in place, and even was considering how to improve the harvest to make the winters more comfortable.  You suggested inventing the sport of skiing in the region, which caused a lot of confusion with Rowan, Marcelle, and Lucien.  The four of you were walking towards the market, where you were struck by that bolt of lightning before, when some city-folk came up to you.  &quot;Your Grace?&quot;  One asked.  &quot;What brings you into the city?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wanted to go to the market and get some food.&quot;  Rowan smiled at the man.  &quot;Is it that uncommon for someone to desire food?&quot;  You snickered at that, seeing how with your and Rowan&#39;s immortality, it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not, Your Grace.&quot;  He replied.  &quot;It&#39;s just that you are our king, just walking around like a regular person?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes, even kings desire the simple things in life.&quot;  Rowan smiled, touching the man&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Sometimes, I just want to live life as a regular person, going to the shops and markets.  I want to see how my subjects live.  Plus, the fresh food from the market is always the best.&quot;  The man looked faint from his king acting so casually towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to him?&quot;  Another person asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax.&quot;  Rowan said, swishing his long, blond hair (He&#39;s in that form right now).  &quot;He&#39;s shocked to see his king addressing him as casually as I was.&quot;  You watched as Rowan&#39;s hand turned a faint white, bringing color back into the man&#39;s skin.  He returned to his former strength.  &quot;I&#39;m not Rowan the Destroyer, or the Dark Sorcerer, or whatever people called me anymore.  I&#39;m your king.  I&#39;ve obtained the power to heal and comfort people.  Now, I think I&#39;ll head towards the market.  My familiar really wants to get lunch there.  Right Gannoth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Truer than true Master.&quot;  You smiled, wrapping your arm around Rowan.  &quot;Let&#39;s eat!&quot;  You, Rowan, and Marcelle were all smiling as you continued waling towards the market.  Lucien showed a slight smile, but he was still being his emotionless self.  You, noticing this, asked, &quot;Lucien, why don&#39;t you ever smile?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, my Lord?&quot;  Lucien asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you never seem very happy.&quot;  You started.  &quot;You&#39;re always really formal and serious.  Loosen up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah brother!  Be more smiley!&quot;  Marcelle yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like me.&quot;  Lucien expained.  &quot;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not happy, or are being really serious.  It&#39;s just how I express my emotions.  That, and I don&#39;t want to show the whole world my fangs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair point.&quot;  Rowan laughed.  &quot;Come on, the market is close by.&quot;  You all continued towards the hustling, bustling market.  It was quite a sight.  People were going from stall to stall, trying to buy whatever the could.  There were farmers selling their harvest, bakers, distillers, smiths, tailors, and more!  If you needed anything, you could buy it here.  The commotion came to a halt when one person noticed that their king, and essentially their prince (you) were there.  &quot;Why did everyone stop?&quot;  Rowan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s because a king just casually walked into a crowded market.  Usually, servants are the ones who buy the food and stuff.&quot;  You laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Either way, we&#39;re here.  What do you want Gannoth?&quot;  Rowan asked you, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to look around and get what looks yummy.&quot;  You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.  Let&#39;s meet here in one hour.&quot;  Rowan suggested.  &quot;Do you have money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;  You smiled, taking a small leather coin purse out of one of your pockets.  It was filled with gold pieces.  &quot;Considering our royal status, we have a lot of this.&quot;  You smiled, taking a gold piece out.  &quot;See you in an hour!&quot;  You walked away from Rowan, and started looking around the market.  Business returned to normal, despite the fact that royalty was present.  The first line you got on was a line for a bakery.  You had an idea to make a sandwich from things from various stalls.  Even though you were in a human form, your senses were as sharp as a dragon&#39;s.  You could smell the fresh bread, and it was delightful.  As you waited in line, you tried to spark conversation with the locals.  They all felt very awkward having royalty speak to them, but you made sure they were comfortable.  People offered you their place in line, which you politely declined.  You just wanted to act normally.  When you made it to the front of the line, the baker was shocked to see you.  He didn&#39;t know you were here, seeing as he was very busy in his shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello my Lord.&quot;  He stammered.  You weren&#39;t even wearing your crown, but everyone recognized you as the royalty you were.  &quot;What brings you to my humble bakery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I want a loaf of bread.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;Isn&#39;t that why most people come to bakeries?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s just strange for royalty to show up at a regular commoner&#39;s bakery.&quot;  He started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t feel uncomfortable or pressured around me, please.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;Just think of me as a normal customer who wants a normal loaf of bread.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what kind of bread do you want, my Lord?&quot;  He asked, the hesitance in his voice still present.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a small one.  Any kind you like!&quot;  You smiled, looking at the selection of breads on display.  &quot;They all look really good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;  The baker smiled.  &quot;Fresh bread is the best bread.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;Before my Master took me in as a familiar, my mother was an awful cook.  I would always be so happy going out and getting bread from a bakery like this, because it was always so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope my bread is as good as the bread from your memories.&quot;  The baker smiled, looking in the back of his shop for a smaller loaf of bread.  When he came back, he came with a selection of small loaves and bread rolls.  &quot;Are any of these what you desire, my Lord?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot;  You started, looking at the rolls.  Eventually, you came across the perfect sandwich sized roll.  &quot;That one!&quot;  You pointed to it.  &quot;How much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s normally 3 copper pieces, but since you are royalty...&quot;  He started.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you one gold.&quot;  You interrupted him, causing shock.  &quot;You are friendly, the bread smells and looks wonderful, and I&#39;m generous.  Please take this.&quot;  You handed him the gold piece, his expression not changing from the shock.  &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;  You walked away, smiling at the fact that you made one peasant very happy, and will continue to do so.  You continued this routine, going to the vegetables, cured meats, cheeses, and distiller&#39;s booths.  Eventually, you had the perfect sandwich, and a mug of ale to go with it.  After the hour was up, you returned to the spot you designated as a meeting spot, and waited for the others.  They showed up after a few minutes.  You talked about what you bought, and what you experienced.  It seemed as though you weren&#39;t the only one with a generous heart that day, as Rowan also told his vendors to keep the change of the gold pieces he used.<br />
<br />
As you left, you started to have a bad feeling once again.  &quot;Master.&quot;  You started.  &quot;Something&#39;s coming.  I can feel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot;  Rowan stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all feel it.&quot;  Lucien started.  &quot;There&#39;s something coming, and it&#39;s going to attack right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I beat it up?&quot;  Marcelle asked in a childish way.  &quot;I&#39;m good at that kind of stuff!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;  Rowan stated in a much more serious tone than he was using the whole day.  &quot;I need to judge your strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot;  Marcelle smiled.  As she said this, you noticed a looming figure in the horizon.  It was huge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, what is that?&quot;  You asked, with a frightened tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That, Gannoth, is a titan.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;They are very powerful beasts that roam the land and have caused mass destruction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is it here?&quot;  You asked.  &quot;Has it destroyed any of our kingdom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it did, then we would have hard about it from the messenger dragons scattered throughout the land.&quot;  Rowan started.  Judging from it&#39;s location, it was just in Kastos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How powerful are they?&quot;  You asked, feeling a bit scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite the size of a titan, they go down relatively easily.&quot;  Lucien stated.  &quot;With your strength, you could defeat one without much effort.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready!&quot;  Marcelle smiled.  The titan was getting closer.  You could hear screams from around the marketplace as people started to notice it.  Marcelle lept gracefully into the air and started flying towards the titan.  You lost sight of her after a bit, but trusted her.  After a minute, you could tell that she made it to the titan, as there was a flash of light, and the titan disappeared.  Marcelle returned, smiling.  &quot;It&#39;s very dead now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Marcelle.&quot;  Rowan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot;  You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, one thing I&#39;m good at is making things explode, so I make the titan explode from the inside out!&quot;  Marcelle smiled, panting a bit.  &quot;Exploding something that big is hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but not impossible.&quot;  Lucien stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh!  I just did it!&quot;  Marcelle yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;  A random woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!  I&#39;m Marcelle, and this is my brother Lucien.  We&#39;re Rowan&#39;s main guards!&quot;  Marcelle smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are so young though.&quot;  The woman noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Age does not denote power Ma&#39;am.&quot;  Lucien stated.  &quot;We all are quite young in appearance, yet powerful beyond our years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway Miss, we have to go.&quot;  Marcelle smiled.  You noticed that her fangs were considerably smaller than they were at the castle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.  I need to actually rule now.&quot;  Rowan laughed.  &quot;I will be back to the market many times.&quot;  The four of you started walking towards the castle, people thanking you along the way.  People noticed Marcelle&#39;s destroying of the titan, and were thanking your group for it.  People were starting to like and trust you and Rowan, and it&#39;s only going to get better.<br />
