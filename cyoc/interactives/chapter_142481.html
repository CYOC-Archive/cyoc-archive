<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Out the store and heading home with the bags, you use your free hand to whip out your phone and send a text.<br />
<br />
“how you been doin” You send to Amira. You pop your phone back in your pocket.<br />
<br />
“I’m a little upset I didn’t know Maddie was having bladder issues.” Amber says as the two of you stroll back to the house.<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” You ask.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” She answers. “She’s always trying to be independent, and support other people all the time, and not make people worry about her.”<br />
<br />
“I get the feeling that--” You pause when you feel your phone buzz. You go into multi-task mode and complete your sentence whilst checking your phone. “I get the feeling that Madison has a grand sense of responsibility, to prove herself useful and capable in competition with a sibling eight years older than her.”<br />
<br />
You open your texts, and yank your head back a bit when the reply is a pic of Amira’s crotch; her panties soaked.<br />
“HORNYYYYYYY” Reads the text underneath it.<br />
<br />
“You’re probably right.” Amber replies. “Madison’s more cut out to be in charge than I am, honestly.”<br />
<br />
“Like she’s more mature than you?” You ask, while punching out “wait til tonight girl damn calm yourself lol” on your phone.<br />
<br />
“Well she’s like five times more mature than I was at her age, and so it stands to reason she’ll be five times as mature as I am right now when she’s sixteen. She’s a lot more ambitious and learns a lot faster...but she has so much pride tied up in not showing weakness.”<br />
<br />
A new pic loads on your screen, of Amira lifting her bare breasts up to her neck and shooting puppy dog eyes at the camera. Damn, you haven’t seen Amira’s tits yet.<br />
“Weakness...like peeing herself?” You ask, saving the pic before stuffing the phone away again. It’s fortunate you came earlier this afternoon or your erection would probably be several times stronger and visible to Amber.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, the fact that she kept it a secret from me is really typical of her.” She sighs. “I always want to give her some encouraging speech or supportive attitude, but she always does a better job being supportive of <i>me</i> than I am of her.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“It’s almost like...she should have been the older sister?” You ask, cocking your head at her.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Times like this, I feel like the younger sibling in everything but height.” Amber answers.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, foreshadowing.” You think out loud.<br />
<br />
“Foreshadowing?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” You say, smiling.<br />
<br />
“Danny, sometimes you really confuse me.” She says, staring at you. “...WAIT, I mean ‘Daniel’. Sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Pshh, don’t worry dude. I said last night you can call me whatever.”<br />
<br />
“I guess...oh, speaking of last night, I’m glad to know you took my advice and got a girlfriend!” She says, beaming at you ryely.<br />
<br />
“What?? I mean, wait, how did you know?” You stammer.<br />
<br />
“It was pretty obvious on the look on your face when you were checking your phone just now.” She says.<br />
<br />
“Oh… what really? That obvious?”<br />
<br />
“That, and the fact that you got an erection at the same time.”<br />
<br />
“What?!” You look down at your pants. “Hey!” You cover your groin with the bag. “It wasn’t that obvious!”<br />
<br />
“Well, after last night, I think it’s fair to say we are pretty involved in each-other’s personal space, are we not?”<br />
<br />
“I guess…” You huff and puff. Even with absolute mind manipulation power, girls keep out-flanking you and making you feel like an idiot.<br />
<br />
Regardless, you want to keep your business with Amira on the down-low. So…<br />
~Don’t talk about my sex life with anyone. You are mentally incapable of discussing it with anyone other than me.~ You command.<br />
<br />
You get back, and see Madison already home, eating cereal at one end of the dining room table. You put the bags down at the other end of the table and exchange greetings.<br />
<br />
“We got some shiz for you.” Amber says, sliding the bags to the side.<br />
<br />
“<i>‘We’?</i>” Madison asks, really confused. “Who’s ‘we’? You and Mr. McGhost the third?”<br />
<br />
Oh. OH. You still never deactivated the command that Madison not notice you.<br />
~You are able to detect my presence like normal again.~ You say real quick.<br />
<br />
Madison blinks a few times, then throws her spoon up onto the floor with a basey “EEP” when she notices you.<br />
“I didn’t see you there! Sorry!” She catches her breath, getting off the stool and cleaning up the mess caused by the spoon. “So you got me… shiz? What kind of shiz?” She asks, putting her new spoon in the bowl and sitting back down.<br />
<br />
“Wellllll, I know this is going to be a bit difficult,” Amber says, “buuut we basically got you diapers.” She pulls the two packs of Goodnites from the bags and shows them to her.<br />
<br />
“...okayyyy…” Maddie says, dead eyed at her sister as she continues nonchalantly eating her cereal.<br />
<br />
“Daniel told me about the bladder problems you’ve been having.” Amber says, reaching a hand out to her. “And we just want to let you know, that it’s perfectly normal and there’s nothing to feel embarrassed about.”<br />
<br />
“Bladder problems? Like peeing yourself?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Daniel told me about it.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I wouldn’t be embarrassed by something I can’t control, obviously.” Madison takes a bite of cereal. “But… I haven’t been having bladder problems.” She looks over at you. “Your name is Daniel? Hi Daniel, why do you think I have bladder problems? I don’t.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Maddie, come on you can be real with us.” Amber says, leaning forward in her chair. “And wait, you guys have met, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I mean, I KNOW Daniel I just didn’t know what his name was. We only talked for like two seconds yesterday.” She explains, before downing the sugary milk at the bottom of her bowl.<br />
<br />
“That’s weird. Danny, I mean, uh… Danny. How did you know about her bladder problems already?” Amber asks.<br />
<br />
“I don’t HAVE bladder problems.” Madison interjected.<br />
<br />
“Your mom told me about it.” You answer, quick to the draw of interrogation.<br />
<br />
Amber turns from you and back to Madison.<br />
“Maddie why did mom tell Daniel about it before telling me?” She asks.<br />
<br />
“I DON’T HAVE A BLADDER PROBLEM!” She yells. She throws her spoon into her empty bowl. “UGH, you guys are jerks.”<br />
<br />
Madison looks like she’s about to launch herself off the stool and storm up to her room. Time to diffuse the situation.<br />
<br />
~You have a weakened bladder.~ You command to Madison. You continue,<br />
~You have stress incontinence. This means that coughing, laughing, sneezing, running, or even sitting down or standing up, can cause you to pee a little. Sometimes a lot. You have a particularly bad case of stress incontinence. Around 1/4th of all your pee is now leaked involuntarily, and it could be much more if you drink a lot of water before physical activity. You also wet the bed pretty heavily, too.~<br />
<br />
You take a moment to catch your breath, before continuing to set everything up.<br />
~You have memories of this bladder issue, starting a few weeks ago. You starting leaking here and there, then having full-blown episodes of wetting your pants. Several mornings awoken to moist sheets. You have confided this to your mom and your dad, but have avoided bringing it up to Amber until she confronted you on it just now.~<br />
<br />
You hope there isn’t some sort of character limit for commands. That was a mouthful, but you wanted to ensure you got the nuance right.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Oh!” You blurt out, making a quick command to both Maddie and Amber,<br />
~Both of you, forget the little tussle you had just now. The way you both remember it, Amber and I came into the room and brought the bladder problem to your attention, and then you willfully acknowledged it. It is from that moment that our conversation picks up.~<br />
<br />
You really had a mess to clean up there. You were enjoying messing with Maddie like that. You were considering making her entire family turn against her, insisting that she has these bladder problems and effectively gaslighting her into believing it, without the use of the sapphire. But when it finally came time to kick up a fuss about it, Maddie was a lot more dominant and less embarrassed than you wanted her to be. So you changed your mind. Finally, with all that out of the way, the dialogue can resume.</p>
