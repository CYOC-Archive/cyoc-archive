<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim&#39;s face lit up as he heard Mom&#39;s voice. He suddenly realized that he was hungry! He ran up the stairs and started helping Mom with groceries. <br />
<br />
Whoa! He was way taller than Mom now! Weird! <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, could you get me some plates from up there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH, why of course! I am the tall one now!&quot; <br />
<br />
You almost smack your little forehead. <br />
<br />
Mom ignored him. She wrinkled her nose in slight disgust. &quot;Woo, you been working out those big muscles.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they feel great!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I know what that means. Tim, honey,&quot; she turns to you. &quot;Could you go play in your room, sweetheart?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why? I want to help you make dinner,&quot; you offer thoughtfully. Also, you are trying to get Tim in Dad&#39;s body to not be alone with Mom...it looks like she is really wanting some alone time with your father and unfortunately you know that look! <br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, listen to your Mom,&quot; Tim says in Dad&#39;s body. I stare daggers at him and march upstairs with a heavy sigh. Maybe there are some Legos I can play with! <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Tim is feeling things he&#39;s never felt before. He&#39;s feeling warm and strong and Mom is so small in his arms. He starts to feel her with a hug and then she&#39;s kissing his pecs and licking them! <br />
<br />
&quot;God, I love your big muscular body! You want to do it before Chuck gets home?&quot; <br />
<br />
That&#39;s me! Tim thinks. She means Dad in Chuck&#39;s body! He tries to resist her but she&#39;s all over him, so lithe and suddenly she doesn&#39;t seem so momlike anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH, Mommy,&quot; Tim says and plants a kiss and then another and another on his mother&#39;s neck and lips. He kisses her deep and long. Then he sweeps her into his arms and carries her into their bedroom. She loves being in his big, muscular arms, so defined. &quot;So...what do you want to do now?&quot; Tim asks, trying to remember something from his Dad&#39;s brain that could help out with this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just lie back, sweetie...&quot; and soon she is sucking his dick and his face immediately turns into an &quot;O&quot; shape and he&#39;s feeling so good as he cums for the first time, explodes in her mouth, all his man seed giving him the rush/relief of a testosterone fueled post workout rush combined with orgasm rush.<br />
<br />
I think I&#39;m gonna like being the Dad...maybe I can stay in this big bod for just a few days longer! Tim thinks. Everything feels so natural and good. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on...we should get dinner ready!&quot; <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
You come downstairs when your &quot;mother&quot; calls you down. Chuck walks in the door...that is, your father in YOUR body. He smiles and drops his backpack and bends down to whisper &quot;Score!&quot; in your ear. What is he talking about, a video game? Or does he mean that girl that he liked? Girls are gross. Airplanes are way better. <br />
<br />
Dad...Tim...he&#39;s talking with Mom...it confuses you. Who is who again? Aren&#39;t you Tim? But wait, no you were Dad before....and then you were Chuck first. You remember your real name is Chuck. We need to use the magic socks before I start acting like a little kid all the time!  <br />
<br />
After dinner the three of you scamper off down to Dad&#39;s special workout room. You all get the chance to talk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, Dad...being in your body is amazing. I loved working out today! These muscles are great. I don&#39;t even mind having this gut!&quot; Tim pats his gut. It is a solid muscle gut, and Dad was no stranger to steroids back in the day. Tim is really enjoying being a man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad son. I have a little confession. I made out with that girly of yours. You&#39;re gonna love her. I have a date with her tomorrow. Only...maybe it would be better if I just went on the first date with her, just to make sure things run smoothly.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You want to kiss a girl? That&#39;s gross,&quot; you tell him. <br />
<br />
He laughs. &quot;Yeah, I guess that&#39;s the magic. You&#39;re acting more like Tim all the time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m really acting like you, Dad. Mom thought I was you all night!&quot; Tim told his Dad. He didn&#39;t mention doing anything with Mommy that he probably wasn&#39;t supposed to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a little boy anymore,&quot; you complain, sounding like Tim does when he gets too tired. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, sweetheart. But...I&#39;m having a great time. Can&#39;t you just hold on a little longer for me, sweetheart?&quot; Tim in Dad&#39;s body asks you. He really is sounding like Dad. He even called you sweetheart! He hasn&#39;t called you that in ten years! <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll let you have some ice cream and chocolate sauce if you agree to a few more days,&quot; Dad adds, from your body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; you immediately say. You all head upstairs again and you zoom towards the fridge eagerly as Tim opens the freezer door. You can&#39;t reach it anymore and that&#39;s where the ice cream is! <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, speaking of new taste buds,&quot; Tim says in Dad&#39;s body, after scooping you several scoops of delicious ice cream. You salivate just looking at them. &quot;Would you be okay if I smoked one of your cigars, Dad? I really want one tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You little rascal,&quot; Dad says in his 15 year old frame. &quot;I&#39;ll come along so I can give you some pointers.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I smoke cigars one day? When I&#39;m older?&quot; you ask. &quot;I mean when I go back to my body?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fifteen&#39;s a little young, sweetheart. I can&#39;t smoke cigars in this body, your mother would freak out,&quot; Dad says in your body. &quot;But you know what, you&#39;re not gonna get the chance again for a long time so I say go enjoy a stogie, Tim.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Dad! Or...son. Should I call you son now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Probably, if your mother sees you calling me Dad we&#39;d have a lot to explain.&quot; <br />
<br />
They leave you and you are watching cartoons. Tim is out on the patio talking with Dad. They are both so tall and they are laughing about adult things they are talking about. Tim has a big 7 inch long 60 gauge cigar firmly planted in his mouth. He puffs and puffs as Dad talks to him. You wish you knew what they were saying. They retire to the lounge chairs and Tim looks like he&#39;s going on about something. You finish your ice cream and after a while you get bored so you go out to talk to the men of the family. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, here he is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Our new &quot;Dad&quot; here was just finishing his first cigar. How&#39;d you like it, champ?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I love cigars! I wish I could smoke them when I go back to being a kid.&quot; He looks down on you looking a bit regretful. &quot;It&#39;s even better than I thought it would be. Grrrr!&quot; Tim chomps on his cigar and does various muscle poses, getting up and showing off his big arms. He&#39;s so big and strong! you think. <br />
<br />
Eventually he stubs out his cigar. Tim is so much taller than you that you have to look way up into him and you hug his leg to get his attention. You really want him to pay attention to you. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Daddy,&quot; you let yourself say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Awww. Someone is tuckered out.&quot; Tim and Dad laugh. Tim lifts you into his arms. He&#39;s so comforting, big and strong. You forgot the sensation of being in another man&#39;s arms, your daddy&#39;s arms. You feel so good trusting him as he carries you off to bed...</p>
