<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff held tightly to his emitter and was ready to evolve Venus further in life.  And to think, Venus was once an everyday flytrap.  But thanks to the Chronivac and the Evolution Package, his plant is slowly shaping into a living entity.  Not only that, but Venus was beginning to gain some form of intelligence and the more he uses the emitter, the more turned on she had become.  And now she wanted more of a change as she wants to know what she would turn into.  And anticipation is staggering and pointed his emitter right at the former plant.  Pulling the trigger, he fired right at Venus and she could feel it in her green skin.  Jeff could only watch as the former houseplant continued to change.<br />
<br />
She started to grow a little taller and resembled that of a kid.  Her body continued to thicken as she started to look a little shapely.  Jeff looked on and could tell that Venus was right.  She certainly was a girl.  That’s then she spotted what was suppose to be the chest two darker green dots and maturing to little point.  He could tell that they were nipples, meaning that her breasts will grow momentarily.  He could even see the waist area gaining a bit of curves to the side.  The tentacle like legs were filling in quite nicely as they move on their own accord.  Already, she was slithering like a multiple snakes as she was getting use to walking very weirdly.  But then, in between the many snake like lest as a little line forming, which is the beginning of her pussy.  “Yep, she’s definitely a girl.” he said with pure interest.  Her four arms extended and bulked up a little more as the little fingers grew a little longer and skinny.  She curled and felt her developing fingers, as the sensations were extremely overwhelming.  Venus moaned a little as she could feel the changes accelerating her sexual drive.  During the moaning, a mysterious growth appeared around her sharp mouth and top stem, expanding and rounding into an oval like shape.  Jeff looked at the new appendage intently and could tell that it was the beginning of the head.  Starring at the changes, he could tell that Venus was less of a plant and looking a little more human.<br />
<br />
Once the changes stopped, Jeff approached her and said, “Venus, how are you feeling?”  Venus looked to him, even without some eyes, and responded in a much clearer voice.  “Oh master, I feel different, feel reborn.  I could feel smarter.  Again master, again!”  Jeff looked on and was could tell that she had gain some form of intelligence.  She also had some form of awareness in her as well.  Almost like that of a human.  Clearing the evolution package is really changing her to what she would look like and she wanted more of it.  Wondering how far he can go, he smiled and said, “Whatever you say.”  Pointing the emitter at her again, he fired and watched as Venus evolved further into her life.<br />
<br />
Venus’s height grew considerably, getting above the three-foot length and reaching middle way.  He could also see her womanly attributes developing as well as she was looking shapely then before.  He could see her chest budding around her nipples and looked like small mounds.  Those mounds soon expanded into simple cones, marking the beginnings of her breasts.  Her waist area curved a little more as her hips expanded further.  Her four arms extended further and looked to be a bit more toned, gaining a bit of muscles.  Her hands changed further and looked human like and dainty with her fingers growing longer and thinner.  And to think they were once small little leaves.  Her tentacle like legs were growing and toning as well as they regained some serious strength.  In fact, the evolved too much that she could stand on her own and move around without any problems.  Her little slit matured as well as it regained a preteen like development.  Inside her body, she could feel the changes progressing as well.  Besides a heart, she also was developing a few extra organs to keep her alive.  That includes lungs to breath, a stomach to produce food, some kidneys, and a bit of sexual organs.  Her head was developing as well and was gaining some human like features.  Around the sharp mouth, the skin around it closed completely and started to puff up a bit, creating the beginning of lips.  Two little slits then appeared and surprisingly enough, she was starting to breath the moist air.  Some sort of red fuzz appeared at the top of her head and was beginning to grow bit by bit.  And to top it all off, there were two little dots at the front of her face.  Now she looked more human then a common houseplant.<br />
<br />
Venus could sense her body in every way and couldn’t feel any happier then this.  She could feel her body maturing and evolving further into her new form.  During that time, her newly developed hands probed her own new body and was enjoying every second of it.  But then, when she touched her chest, she felt something completely different.  She didn’t know what it was, but it felt like some form of pleasure.  Placing both her upper hands on her newly formed breasts, she rubbed them and moaned for a bit, feeling every moment of it.  Meanwhile, Jeff was watching this little show and couldn’t help but to feel aroused himself.  He could even feel his boner slowly sticking out underneath his pants.  He tried desperately to cover himself up, but he can’t help looking at this former houseplant turning into a green skin beauty.  She moaned and groaned and she felt she needed to evolve further.  “More.  I must have more.” she said in pure ecstasy.  Jeff looked to her and could tell that she wanted to keep evolving to improve her sexual drive.   Looking to her in satisfaction, he fired his emitter once more and Venus evolved further into life span.<br />
<br />
Her grew taller and has reached the four-foot mark while her body started to become strange, but sexy.  Her developing hands still grabbed hold of her breasts, as they grew considerably from A cups, growing round and firmer.  The moment they got big, she could actually squeeze them as they felt so soft.  She gainer some serious curves in her stomach region as her hips expand to the point it looked wide enough for a young teen.  Jeff could even see a hole growing on her stomach as it marked a belly button of sort.  Her arms gained more muscle as her lower arms stretched while the upper arms held on to her breasts.  The tentacle like roots stayed the same, but the end points started to grow longer, almost slanting upwards.  In her body, Venus’s organs continued to develop and mature to help her survive.  She could even feel something hardening all within her body as well.  What’s actually happening is that she was developing and bones as it harden and shape to fit her newly evolved body.  Her new vagina developed as well as the slit grew wider and plant like ovaries grew in to connect to the uterus.  Her head changes as well as the lips swelled a bit while the color grew a slight tint of red.  On the two slits, a tiny bump appeared and grew a bit, forming the beginning of what appears to be a nose.  The dots on the upper face grew as green skin grew over it.  Two more extra holes appeared at the side of her head and skin grew around it.  And the red fuzz grew downward and was threaded, making it her hair.  Looking on, Jeff could tell that Venus was getting beautiful and sexy the more he keeps evolving her.<br />
<br />
Venus was continuing to rub her breasts as her sexual energies continued to expand.  During her time, one of her root legs managed to snake its way into her newly developed pussy plunged deep into it.  She felt an electric shock and didn’t know what she did.  But in a matter of seconds, she started to enjoy it as she fingered her pussy with her own root tentacle.  Plunging it deeper, she moaned in pleasure as her voice was clearing up and sounded very womanly.  Jeff couldn’t control it as his penis was at full attention in his pants.  Venus was in pure bliss as she said in a demanding voice, “More!  Give me more!  And want to feel it!  I want to feel it all!!!”  Without hesitation, he pressed the emitter more and watched as the changes continued to progress.<br />
<br />
Venus’s height spouted like a weed, literally, as she went past for feet and shortly approaching five.  Her breasts grew underneath her hands as it went to perky Bs to full-grown Cs and still growing.  Her hips expanded and her stomach was extremely curvy, giving her a perfect hourglass figure.  Her arms were long and toned, giving off some feminine muscle while her hands were matured and red harden nails grew out of her skin.  Her tentacles roots grew longer as they look like something out of a porno anime.  Venus then plunged two more into her newly created pussy, trying to find her sweet spot.  Even her organs were almost finished developing as she could feel them working.  Her bones finished hardening as she felt like she was invisible.  Her head finished morphing as it looked more human then ever. Her lips were fully puffy as she opened her mouth to moan, Jeff would see her sharp teeth as they were smaller and formed a curve in her mouth.  Green cartilage grew in the middle of her face and formed a life like nose.  The skin around the holes to the side of her head shifted into an oval shape, turning into a pair of ears.  The skin under the two orbs thickened and looked like eyelids.  And her red hair grew downward to her shoulders and styled into a wavy way.  Jeff could see a woman coming out of an ordinary flytrap and enjoyed the end results.  But for Venus, she felt as though something was missing.<br />
<br />
She kept on masturbating herself more and more as she was getting closer to the climax.  But the need was getting harder as she kept demanding for the change.  “No!  Don’t stop!  Keep it coming!  I want release!” she said with a clear voice complete with perfect sentences.  Jeff looked to his remote and wondered if he can do this or not.  She looked so hot now and if he kept on using it, she might turn into a monster or something far beautiful then her previous form.  But seeing her looking so good, he can’t refuse.  So for safety purposes, he fired it a little more to see if she could finish.  Venus groaned more and more as her body kept blossoming and her height grew a little more.  Finally, after many attempts, she screamed in a complete orgasm as she reached her climax.  Once she was done, she let go of her breasts and let the root legs go out of her vagina.  Then something amazing happened.  Slowly, she opened her eyes as they were blood red and for the first time, she could see the world before her.  Turning to the mirror, she observed herself and was amazed at how she looks.<br />
<br />
Venus went from being a common houseplant, stuck eating flies in a small pot, to a voluptuous green skinned plant/human hybrid.  She looked every bit perfect in any way, shape, and form from her 5’2 height to her gorgeous breasts that was upgraded between a CC and D.  Placing her lower hand to her hip and higher hand to her upper back, she smiled and pose saying in a highly intelligent voice, “Wow…  Look at me.  I’m one hot beauty.  Definitely not going back to the mindless flytrap I once was.”  Turning around, he could see Jeff starring and amazement of what he had done.  With a coy look, Venus slithered to him with her hips a swaying, and gave him a deep hug with all four arms and have the rooted legs.  Then she pressed her lips with his and have him a deep and passionate kiss.  That lasted for a few short seconds until she broke it and starred him down with loving eyes.  “Oh thank you master,” she said very happily, “You have giving me life to my previous existence and gave me the chance to live with your kind.  I’m forever in your debt to you.”  Jeff smiled and laughed a little and didn’t know how to respond.  “Gee…” he started, “Thanks…  I was just experimenting on that Evolution Package on the Chronivac.  Never thought that it could turn you into this.”  Venus gave a bit of a giggle and could tell that he was truthful.  But looking down to his pants with a simple bulge, she licked her lips and said seductively, “Looks like you’re not the only one happy to see me.  Why don’t we celebrate with experiencing what sex is like?”  Now Jeff is red in the face and didn’t know what to do.  Would he bang her or leave her be?</p>
