<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at all four generations of women, Lesley wondered what to do with them.  There are many options she can use to changed their ages.  However, there is one thing that’s at the top of her head.  Turns out, these are all four generations of women, meaning all four of them had conceived each other for around four hundred years.  Because of that, there’s always the wonder of when each generation conceived their first child and what they did before it happened.  Course, the youngest is a small toddler as she would have a lot of growing up to do.  But she’ll pass under the bridge when that happens.  For now, she has to keep the show on the road and turned to the audience to explain to them what she would do.<br />
<br />
“Okay ladies and gentlemen!” she started, “As you can see, we have four generations of women on the stage.  Three of whom conceived their first child.  Considering the situation, there is the wonderment of what they did before they even conceived their first girl.  So here’s what I’m going to do.  I’m going to regress the three generations to the age before they created their baby.  The fourth though, I’ll age her to the moment she would conceived her own.  Each woman I’ll start individually and all of you will witness the end result.  Now all of them will change in age both physically and mentally while their clothes shift to match their age.  Last thing I want is for them to not fit their clothing, especially the young one there.  Now let us start the show, shall we?”<br />
<br />
Approaching the four, she started with the oldest, who is Wendy and looked at her.  She already put them in a trance thanks to her special amulet, so it would be easy for her to control them.<br />
<br />
“Wendy?” she said to her, “If you can hear me, I want you to take the journey back.  I want you to think back to before you created your daughter, Michelle.  Regress to that age and empty your head to the point before you conceived your girl.  Relax and enjoy your trip back in time.”<br />
<br />
As she said that, Wendy felt a tingle as she started to slowly regress to the age before conceiving her daughter.  Though nothing much had changed in her body, everyone noticed that her spine looked a little straightened but still in her walker. That clothes that were changing were the same type of clothes, old lady dresses. Her changes stopped at the year 2000 and she was still the same as she was wearing her long flower dress and slippers.  However, that would soon change as she starts to regress through the 1900s.<br />
<br />
Her spine continued to straighten as her body was at the almost right position. Her walker then disappeared, only to be replacing by a cane for balance. Her hair, which was completely white, was showing signs of it darkening to gray. Even her clothes were less elderly and more middle age. So she went from being 83 to 77 years old with a dress that would fit her age.<br />
<br />
She soon went back down to the eighties and was getting younger and regaining strength in her body and mind.  Though she was skinny cause of her old age, it would appear that fat was slowly coming back to her. Her back was almost straight and she was able to stand on her own. But she still held on to her can under doctor’s orders. Her hair is mostly gray with bits of white dotting all over her head. Fashions continued to change over the years as she felt a little more comfortable showing off. Once the changes stopped, she had become a 68-year-old senior citizen wearing a Hawaiian Mumu dress that goes down way below her knees and red high heel shoes.<br />
<br />
But that would soon change as she approaches approaching the middle ages of her life.  For one she gained some weight after loosing most of it in her elderly age. In seconds, her spine disappeared and she was standing straight up, getting her back to the time before her back hurts. Her face started to thin as the joules of her chin were less flabby. Even her breasts seem to be rising up from her chest. Her clothes kept on changing through time, but it was only muumuu dresses. Once the changed were finished, she was a 64-year-old senior citizen wearing a muumuu dress with floral designs on the surface.<br />
<br />
It soon changed when she reached her fifties and looking fresher by the second.  As she regressed, she continued to gain weight, then quickly loose some. Apparently the moment she gained fat over the years of bad dieting, her regression is causing her body to loose it as well. Her breasts were rising higher on her chest and they seem to be plumped for the time. Her stomach, which was bloated at the time, began to decrease in weight as the flabbiness on her arms and legs were starting to tone up. Her face tightened some more and some of the sagginess vanished along the way. Her hair permed up and it was all gray with no white streaks anywhere. Her clothes were changing constantly to make her look fit in her body. Now Wendy is a 59-year-old woman wearing a Mollie Parnis maxi red dress, silk pantyhose, and a pair of red heel dress shoes.<br />
<br />
She kept on going down and down rabbit hole of age as Wendy’s regression was making her feel better. Her body continued to thin and she was gaining muscles. Her breasts went up and were getting a little plumped for the next few years. And the various veins were noticeable on her arms and legs. Her face tightened a little more and the wrinkles on her face seem to be less noticeable. Her gray hair then shortened and permed up, making it look like a style resembling that of a late sixties woman. Lesily then took a close look and noticed that Wendy’s hair had changed color as a few of the strands now had dull blonde on them.  Her clothes also changed to match that sixties look. So now Wendy has become 53-year-old woman who has just left middle age behind. She was wearing a Perma-prest shirtdress that goes down to her mid legs with a leopard print design, white pearls dotting her necklace, and a pair of tan three inch high heel dress shoes.<br />
<br />
Pretty soon, she left her fifties and was looking more beautiful than ever.  Her body trimmed down and it made her look like she was fully fit. Her breasts plumped up to the point they were fully round. Her hips puffed up and curved her waist and her stomach thinned up and was almost flat and thin. Muscle fat took over her arms and legs and she was getting fitter and fitter. Her face then got finer by tightening her skin, wrinkling less, and her eyes getting less tired. Her hair kept perming itself up and more blonde strands dominated her gray. The clothes on her were getting more professional and took over her maturity. In a matter of minutes, Wendy has become of forty-year-old cougar with a killer body for her age. Her clothes consisted like something for a 50’s sitcom complete with a buttoned blouse and flowing skirt that goes down to her knees with a matching red plaid design and a pair of red dress shoes.<br />
<br />
Leaving the 1950’s behind, Wendy was already looking more of a proper, though outdated woman.  Wendy’s body thinned what’s left of her excess fat as the moved through her thirties. Her breasts were firm and bounce while her curved waist revealed a shapely hourglass figure. The muscles on her arms and legs where tight and very luscious. Even her face, though covered in now faint lines around her eyes and mouth, looked very eloquent. Her hair lost her perm and grew long while gray streaks were all that’s left of her blonde tresses. The moment her hair grew long, it twisted itself around and made a perfectly style perm for women in the forties. Her clothes even went back to the time where fashions were contemporary. When the changes stopped, Wendy became a 32-year-old young mother wearing a wool Traina-Norell short dress that goes down to below her knees and buttons in the middle, a fitting hat that matches her dress and a pair of Gucci pump shoes.<br />
<br />
She kept on growing younger to the point before she has ever conceived her daughter, Michelle.  Looking at her Lesley could tell that she was looking to make it big time in the 1940s.  What she was wearing was a silk like gown that goes below her knees and had a neckline where you could see her D-Cup cleavage. She also had on a pearly necklace that goes down to her chest, a pair of 4-inch high heels, and a dome like hat that was popular in the 30s and early 40s. She almost looks like a hooker circa 1940s.<br />
<br />
Lesley looked at the end results; she could tell that she was primed for something that would make her some kind of star.  Walking to her, she started to ask her, “Wendy, do you know how old you are?” Wendy just looked at the performer and told her, “What is that? A stupid question? I’m twenty-seven!” Lesily stepped back and was shocked to hear Wendy’s reaction. Shaking that thought, she continued to conversation by saying, “Well Wendy, what are you planning to do today?” Wendy shrugged her shoulders and responded, “I’m going meet up with this agent a friend of mine told me about. All my life, I want to be a movie star, becoming a celebrity in Tinsel Town and be very famous. And I heard he’s a big deal in Hollywood. So my friend set up a meeting with him and a local bar. Once there he’s going to talk to me about all this business stuff he tells his other clients. Once that settles, then my dreams of being a star is going to be complete. Now are we done here? This agent is coming any minute now and I can’t have my time wasted on you?”<br />
<br />
Lesily listened and should’ve known that. She said to her audience, “Apparently Wendy here had a dream of being a movie star and was about to talk to an agent. But from what we could tell, the agent wanted to do more then talk. And it could explain why Wendy got pregnant with Michelle in the first place.  Big ambitions sometimes get dashed when you get knocked up I always say.  Hmm…  Speaking of Michelle, let us see where she goes before conceiving Jane.”<br />
<br />
Walking up to Michelle, she told her, “Michelle, it’s your time to take the journey back through time.  Think back to the time before you conceived your daughter, Jane.  I want your body, mind, and attire to return to that said event.  Take a deep breath and remember before your first child was created.<br />
<br />
Michelle followed her advice and thought back to the moment before she has ever conceived Jane.  Her body was regaining a little bit of her youth.  Her body was thinning and the fat tissue was building up.  Her saggy breasts risen a bit and her hips shrank from its puffy muffin top.  Her face tightened a little bit and her hair, which was mostly gray was showing a few strands of dull black.  The clothes on her continued to change through time and was getting less elderly.  When she reached the year 2000, she became a 57-year-old middle age woman.  She was wearing a long red dress that goes down to below her ankles, beige pantyhose; a pair of red high heels, and her hair was permed up.  She looked like she was going to a New Years Eve party.<br />
<br />
Once she passed the 2000’s, her body and mind youthened through her middle ages.  All over her body, fat from old age is slowly depleting as her arms and legs were getting a little more tone.  Her breasts were rising higher and loosing most of her sagginess.  Her face was getting tighter as the wrinkles on her skin slowly faded.  Her hair was showing loosing more of its gray as more black strands were returning.  Her clothes kept on changing as they went from a couple of dresses to casual clothes for a middle age woman.  The moment she reached 1994, Michelle was still a middle age woman of 51.  She was wearing a red blouse, large blue jeans, and regular type of sneakers.<br />
<br />
She soon left the 90s and re-enetered the eighties as her body regressed closer to her prime.  Her body was slowly getting back to tip top shape as she was regaining muscles on her arms and legs.  Her breasts went up higher and were plumping up to when they were ripe.  Her stomach, which had developed a lot of body fat over the years shrank and was showing signs of tightness around the edges.  The varicose veins that are one her arms and legs were slowly fading away while her skin was getting less rough and smoother.  Her face, though sagging was tightening around her cheeks at the wrinkles slowly faded away and she was looking less tired.  More gray left her hair as she now has a mix of salt and pepper all over as her hair changes style to make it look like a look from the eighties.  Her clothes went back in time as they went to the nineties to the eighties.  In a matter of minutes, Michelle has become a middle age 42 year old.  She was wearing a long sweater dress that goes down to her knees with black and blue stripes design, pantyhose, a bracelet on her right wrist and a pair of black dress high heel shoes.<br />
<br />
She was getting closer and closer to the day before conceiving her daughter and already, the audience could see that she was getting more pretty and sexy as time went on.  Her body got more toned and her muscles on the arms and legs were returning.  Her breasts swelled up and were big and round, looking close to D cups.  Her stomach was lean and broad though there were signs of stretch marks around them after giving birth to Jane.  Her face was youthening as wrinkles turned into faint lines and her cheekbones were tightening.  Her eyes were getting less tired while her hair had only less gray and more black.  It also gotten shorter then before, like almost a boys cut.  And her clothes changed more and more, reaching to the point she has to wear dresses and styles at the beginning of the eighties.  With her changes stopped, she had become a 37-year-old woman wearing a nightgown that showed a little cleavage.<br />
<br />
Reaching the final stretch, Michelle approached the age on the day before conceiving her baby girl.  Not much has changed in a year and a half, but if the audience would notice, the stretch marks faded and she looked like a woman before pregnancy.  When she got back to thirty-seven, she was wearing a muumuu tube that shows cleavage on her now CC cup breasts and a bottom hem that went down to her mid thighs, showing off her long and sultry legs with her bright white GoGo boots.  Almost like she was on a trip of some kind.<br />
<br />
When that regression was finished, Lesily approached her and asked her, “Michelle, I want to know what year is it and how old you are.”  Michelle was the first to speak as she said, “It’s 1979 and I’m 36 years old.”  Lesily nodded and said, “So Michelle, tell me…  How is your marriage?” Michelle just sighed to herself and said, “Pretty good, I guess.  We are celebrating our 4th anniversary together in Hawaii and it was beautiful.  The palm trees, the nightclubs, the restaurants.  It’s all so beautiful.  Though, I do think we would make a baby while we’re on this trip.  I can feel my biological clock ticking and I don’t want to miss out on it.”<br />
<br />
Lesily turned to the audience and told them, “Hmm…  Looks like Michelle conceived Jane when she was on her anniversary in Hawaii.  Was hoping she would’ve done the whoopee in Vegas, but it’s close enough.  Now then, let’s move on to the next participant.”  She soon approached Jane and told her the same thing as her mother and grandmother.  “Jane, it’s your turn to embark on a journey.  I want you to think back of the time before you had Katie.”<br />
<br />
Jane listened to her and thought of that time before she had a daughter.  Unlike Wendy and Michelle, it didn’t take long for her to go back to the time she conceives Katie.  Other then the clothing change, nothing else has changed within her.  For she used have faint lines around her eye and mouth and there was a sprinkle of gray strands on her dull brown hair.  Now her lines were fainter and there was less gray on her hair.  When she stopped at two years younger, her clothing looked more professional.  They consist of a consecutive business blouse, a tight business skirt that goes down to below the knees, pantyhose, and a pair of 3 inch black heels.  Lesily expect that she was working at a professional job during that time.<br />
<br />
When those changes were done, Lesily approached Jane and asked her, ““Jane, what year is it today?”  The moment she asked that, Jane said in a hypnotic state, “2009.”  “And what are you going to be doing today?” asked Lesily.  “Well, after I get through with my job, my husband and I are going to celebrate our third anniversary together and then end it with a little love making.” Jane said in eager anticipation, “I promised myself that when I reach thirty, I’m going to have a baby.  Let’s hope that I will make one on the first go.”  Lesily smiled, knowing that it would actually happen.<br />
<br />
Approaching the crowd, she told them, “It would seem that Jane here wishes to have a planned pregnancy, unlike Michelle and Wendy. Who would’ve thought that on that day she would create her precious daughter.  Speaking of which…”<br />
<br />
She turned to a young Katie sitting on the stage in a huge trance from the magical necklace.  “We don’t know what day Katie will start having her child.  Could be rather interesting on what age she would conceive her first child.  Let’s see what her future holds, shall we?” she asked as she was ready for the final act.<br />
<br />
Heading to Katie, she bent down to her cute face and told her, “Katie, it’s time for you to take the journey forward.  I want you to imagine yourself getting older.  But not too old.  Think about what age you will become before you could conceive your first child.”  Toddler Katie heard that and while her infant mind didn’t understand it, she did follow what the hostess said.<br />
<br />
Her body started to tingle and Katie started to change.  But unlike her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she went the opposite and started to age.  The audience noticed the first signs of the changes.  She started to grow a little bigger as she was slowly losing her baby fat.  Her face remained the same with her cheeks looking a little flatter and her short hair grew a little longer, shifting into a pair of pigtails.  Then, as she was sitting, she was starting to get up and stand on her own accord.  She wobbled a little bit until she managed to strand straighter.  Her clothes then made a transition as well as her summer dress lengthened, her diapers progressed to childish panties, and a pair of sandals appeared on her feet.  The crowd watched in awe as toddler Katie turned into a child of five.<br />
<br />
But that didn’t stop there as Katie kept on aging at an alarming rate.  She started to grow a little taller, passing up to three feet as the remaining baby fat vanished on her body, leaving her completely skinny.  Her face lost that cuteness of that of a child and went from being a kid at her age.  Her cheeks were a little flat, her eyes look smaller, and her hair grew longer as the pigtails vanished.  Her clothes have changed but they looked a little different.  By the looks of it, she was dressed to go trick or treating for Halloween.  She had on a doctor’s uniform for kids, a pair of pink Nike sneakers, and had a toy device that checks your heartbeat.  Now Katie looked like a young girl of eight ready for Halloween.<br />
<br />
However, Halloween has come and gone as she kept on progressing and entering her double digits.  She grew a little longer and was near the four-foot mark.  Due to her lost baby fat, she looked completely skinny and very gangly.  But the audience watched on and notice that there were signs of puberty beginning to unfold.  There were signs of small bumps growing from her chest as the beginnings of breasts.  There were also a little wideness on her lips as she was loosing her tomboyish looks.  Her face was starting the cross the threshold of adulthood with her eyes grew smaller and elegant and her hair grew much longer, forming into a type of ponytail.  Her clothes have shifted to match that of a pre teen girl.  She had on a plain T-shirt with a My Little Pony logo, slim skinny jeans, and a pair of blue and pink Sketcher sneakers.  Looking on, the audience could tell that the eleven-year-old Katie was going through the early stages of puberty.<br />
<br />
But before the audience could marvel at this, Katie was quickly leaving her preteens and entering her teenage years.  Again she grew and had some very serious changes in her body.  For one, Katie’s height grew quickly as she was going through a bunch of growth spurts.  She was now past the four-foot mark and soon approaching five.  But as her height changed, so did her body as it starts to mature further to a woman.  Her chest grew from the front, forming into teen like breasts.  They continue to grow from small bumps, to cones, A-cups, and finally perky B-cups.  Her hips expanded further as she was showing signs of an hourglass figure.  Even the curves were completely evident along with her toned stomach.  As her arms and legs grew in length, her muscles began to increase a little bit, giving her a bit of feminine definition.  It wasn’t much but gives Katie a teenage look to her.  Her face matured as well as there wasn’t anything childish about it.  Her shape is more oval like and not round, the cheekbones were completely flat, her nose was narrower and long, eyes smaller and beautiful, and her lips started to puff up, looking a little kissable then before.  Within her mouth, her teeth started to rearrange as her baby teeth were now adult and braces were on it to make them look straight.  Her ponytail few longer and was bouncing freely with shine and luster.  Her clothes continued to change as she looked like she was ready to go to a private school complete with a school uniform vest, white button shirt, a plaid skirt that goes down to her knees, and a pair of Mary Jane with long white socks.  But another thing that got the audience attention is that Katie had a pair of glasses on her.  That confused everyone, as they had never seen her were glasses during the show until now. Probable guess, she wanted to study hard and used the glasses to help her focus better.<br />
<br />
Lesily was enjoying the show as she was watching this toddler aging before her eyes.  But that wasn’t what she was excited about.  She wants to see what age she would be before creating her first kid.  She wouldn’t wait long as Katie’s growth will stop at…</p>
