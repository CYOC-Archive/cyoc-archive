<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amber crouched low in her seat, trying to minimize her presence to no avail. It wasn’t obvious, but pretty much every student in the classroom was aware of her change in appearance, evident by little glances and quick head movements. Amber tried to focus on the lesson, but the quiet chatter and whispers of the students around her chipped away at her consciousness. By the time the bell had rung for lunch, Amber was first out of the classroom, hearing the students burst into conversation  behind her. She knew her actions would only stir up more conversation about her, yet Amber couldn’t help but get as far away from everyone’s curious hungry stares. <br />
<br />
Once she was in the old unused classroom, where she usually retreated to on normal days, she sat down in a chair and breathed heavily, feeling her pounding heart slow down. Amber chastised herself for going all out on her first day of being a new person. She had planned to wear new normal clothes and try to scout out potential friend groups, but that plan didn’t survive contact with the enemy. Of course people were going to notice her if she wore the hottest trend fashion had all of a sudden. She had gotten carried away shopping online once her dad had given her free reign with his credit card once he had found out she needed new clothes. Boosted in confidence by her new drip, she confidently went to school in the morning only to have that false confidence fade once she was surrounded by her peers.<br />
<br />
What did Amber wear? Well at the time the trend was athletic but casual, so Amber had on a fitted tank top, athletic sweatpants, and new kicks, simple but good looking. She had also tied a sweater around her waist, to further obscure her large horse balls, and added a baseball style cap on to keep her head warm. It was so different from her normal humpty dumpty baggy face and body obscuring sweater and jeans she wore, it was a no brainer people were going to notice. She wasn’t prepared for all the attention she had gotten, and her anxiety was palatable now, evident by her pounding heart as her mind raced into nervousness again.<br />
<br />
With her blood rapidly traveling though her stressed body, Amber’s horsecock began to grow erect, pushing against her sweatpants. Since she used masturbation as a stress reliever, her body was unconsciously trained to grow aroused whenever her mind went haywire with self deprecating thoughts, which usually happened when she was home and alone. At this moment though, she wasn’t at home but at school, where having an erected horsecock was a big problem. <br />
<br />
“Oh no, no, no,” Amber tried to push down her horsedick in haste, but the simulation only made her animal penis harder, making it climb out of the top of her sweatpants. Her dark cock throbbed in tandem with her pounding heart, different in that it danced with perverse lust instead of panic. Amber knew that with her stamina, her erection could defy her will for hours, so she started jacking off. Her right arm moved like the piston of an engine while her left arm steadied her body on her seat.<br />
<br />
Oh how perverse it was to be masturbating in school, Amber could feel herself growing hot in her groin and face, mixture of embarrassment and lust. If someone came into the classroom right now, they would see her in her perverted state of being. There would be no good excuse she could make for her actions and her biggest secret would be out. Her cock grew harder as her worries fueled the flames of arousal. Her strokes flew faster than the wind making audible air swish sounds due to the speed.<br />
<br />
“Oh gouda cheese, please don’t let anyone come in,” Amber whispered to herself as she beat her horsemeat. Precum gushed out in immense amounts, dribbling all over her hand, phallus, and ground. The air was tainted with a dirty sexual scent and it would only get worse when Amber finally came, which she hoped was soon.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed by each, as each second for Amber was a sickening joy and despair, in body and mind. As her pleasure grew so did her fear of getting caught, and that caused a problem. She couldn’t cum. Amber was sure that normally she would’ve jizzed by now, but here she was still fapping with no end in sight. She was too scared, her eyes danced from her dark skinned meat stick to the door of the classroom in frantic worry. <br />
<br />
There would be none coming into this classroom, Amber tried to reason, if there was none here she could relax. She could shoot her goo. Closing her eyes she imagined that she was banging the head cheerleader in the school. They were alone in this classroom and Amber was fucking the sexy sporty girl in her bubbly bottom. There was a rumor that the head cheerleader was a religious person, strange as it was, so she only did anal. Amber was ass pounding a virgin cheerleader in her mind’s eye and it was glorious. She could feel her horse dick growing, literally stretching the cheerleader’s tight behind, filling it with equine flesh. <br />
<br />
As if a key had clicked, the floodgates were unlocked and Amber felt the life liquids flow. From her large balls to her big dick the good stuff moved in pleasuring pulses, before spurting in messy arcs, covering the desk and floor in front of her. <br />
<br />
“Gasp, what the fuck is going on here?” a real voice spoke.<br />
<br />
Amber opened her eyes in horror, but she couldn’t stop cumming or stop her arm from squeezing her cock. There in the flesh at the door was the cheerleader in her imagination.<br />
<br />
“You know I was going to ask if you’re up for joining the squad, but let’s save that for later. Right now I want to know what’s up with that in your hands? Amber right, you listening?”<br />
<br />
Closing her eyes was the biggest mistake in Amber’s life.</p>
