<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin really didn&#39;t want to close his eyes right now, especially after Ty just shrunk him again. But he figured he had no choice over it. Ty could probably force him to keep them shut, so better not to upset his bememoth of a brother.<br />
<br />
He closed them for just a few seconds, more than enough time for Ty to literally change the entire world around them. He opened them and immediately looked at Ty. He didn&#39;t seem any bigger, and he thought he wasn&#39;t smaller than before. He only began to realize what Ty has done as he looked around some more. He saw one of the nerds from school, but he was vastly different looking than before. He had to be close to 8 feet tall with about half as much muscle mass as Ty possesed. Even half of his mass was still so much more mass than any bodybuilder ever had before.<br />
<br />
Just as Dustin wanted to speak up, he saw another even bigger figure approach the nerd. It was one of the jocks, bigger than ever. His size made the nerd look small. He was about as tall as Ty, just over 9 feet. Even his muscles came close to those of his brother. He pushed the nerd around with earthcrushing strength, but the nerd seemed used to it.<br />
<br />
He wanted to speak up once again, but was interrupted by a familiar voice coming from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Ty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin knew this voice. It was the hot girl from his class, Lisa.<br />
<br />
He turned around, but was instantly shocked that even the girls were extremely changed by Ty.<br />
<br />
Lisa had always been beautiful, but this was pushing it far beyond any limits. She was probably 8 1/2 feet tall, utterly towering above his tiny frame. Her face was incredibly gorgeous as she smiled at Ty. Her huge, medicine ball-sized boobs defied gravity under the tube top. Her waist was extremely narrow with 6 taut and toned abs. Her hips flared out wider than her shoulders, leading to big, juicy thighs. Her entire body looked like a combination of a fitness model and a supermodel, and then some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Lisa!&quot; Ty replied as the girls walked by them, giggling during the process. After they passed by them, Dustin got a good look at Lisa&#39;s humongous ass. It swayed from side to side thanks to some jiggly fat, but he could clearly see the definition beneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, Dustin? You like this a bit more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like? No, I hate it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why? I mean, look around us, all the girls in school looked like some morphed hourglass-figured beauties. What&#39;s there not to like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the fact that I&#39;m still small? And the boys are gigantic too! Even the nerds look dozens of times stronger than me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that the point? You can enjoy this life as much as I did before all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Life was never this hard for you, stop kidding yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure felt like it though!&quot; Ty protested. &quot;By the way, I almost forgot one important part!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin was unsure what he meant by that, but he would soon see for himself. Right before his eyes, his already colossal brother began to grow even more gigantic. In the span of just a few seconds he gained half a foot in height and a couple dozens of pounds of solid muscle mass. After what felt like far too long, Ty stopped growing and looked down at his comparably microscopic brother who shivered in fear.<br />
<br />
Ty was now more than 12 feet tall, dwarfing the giants that were his school mates who already towered above Dustin. He was now eye-level with his knees which were surrounded by uncountably many, dense muscle cords. If he was musclebound before, he was a mountain of pure muscle now. His thighs alone were so, so much bigger than Dustin&#39;s whole body. Even his calves came close to his size. From his perspective, each and every one of Ty&#39;s 8 abdominal blocks were looking like steel beams. His impossibly thick pecs made it impossible for him to see a few feet in front of him. His arms jutted out from his shoulders like giant trains of power, with each biceps bigger than fridges.<br />
<br />
Dustin really, really didn&#39;t want to think about how strong he was now, but he had to. Just what could he accomplish now? Lift a few tons? Bend the bar attached to the weights as well? Maybe even lift an SUV? No he couldn&#39;t possibly be that strong... or could he?</p>
