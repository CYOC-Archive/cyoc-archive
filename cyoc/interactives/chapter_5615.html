<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelvin was completely disoriented.  His brain was assaulted by so many sensations his head was swimming and he was loosing his balance.  The pleasurable sensations from his loins and the wonderful feeling of new muscle building over the old muscles all over his body warred with the ache of new bone growth, the pain of his muzzle forming; added to that was the pain of rearranging organs and new teeth growing in.  He teetered and began to fall.  In an instant Tim was supporting him, holding him tight.  Kelvin wrapped his changing arms around the big the bear and held on tight, he was feeling sick; his stomach churned from the vertigo and movement of his guts.  <br />
<br />
Tim held the changing man’s head close to his furry chest and rubbed his back comfortingly.  He spoke soothingly in his gravelly voice.  Kelvin’s new nose drank in the scent of the bearman and it comforted him.  He felt safe, like he used to when he was a child in his daddy’s arms.  Slowly, as Tim stroked Kelvin’s back, Kelvin’s head cleared and his insides stopped churning.<br />
<br />
Kelvin’s body grew into the full bulk of a bear, his posture changed and he sort of grew around Tim, wrapping the bearman in Kelvin’s huge grizzly form.  Kelvin’s claws grew out and he became a fully-grown male grizzly; dense dark brown fur had grown all over his body.<br />
<br />
He looked down at Tim, the top of his head and the back of his long neck was touching the ceiling.  His head was bowed and is body was crouched.  He looked down at the hybrid form bearman in his tight fitting overalls.  Kelvin’s clothes had ripped and fallen off during the metamorphosis and Tim could see the huge ursine erection trembling with each pulse of the grizzly’s heart.<br />
<br />
Kelvin opened his mouth to speak and what came out were growls and grunts.  Obviously, his mind was completely intact, but his newly rearranged mouth couldn’t articulate human speech.  He wanted to say, “What the fuck just happened to me?”<br />
<br />
Tim motioned Kelvin to sit and the great bear backed up, carefully and sat on the couch.  The old couch, after years of bearing the weight of a Hank, who was not a small or skinny man, through countless late night movies finally gave up and collapsed under the colossal weight of the grizzly.<br />
<br />
Tim spoke.  It wasn’t as clear as human speech, some of the words sounded funny, but in hybrid form he could at least articulate most of them so that Kelvin understood what he said.  <br />
<br />
“Look, I’m sorry about this, but I didn’t know what the box did either.  It arrived this morning.  I thought it was just a fancy puzzle box, but it seems to be much more.  I think I know how you can get back to looking human, though I don’t think either of us are human anymore… at least not physically.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
Kelvin tried to speak again and growls, grunts and snuffles came out.  He was extremely frustrated.  He roared out his irritation, raised his pawed arm and brought it down on the arm of the couch.  The couch arm snapped and sagged and the look of obvious surprise played across Kelvin’s ursine face.  He hadn’t meant to hit it that hard.  He wasn’t angry with Tim, just agitated at his inability to communicate.<br />
<br />
“Calm down.”  Tim said, “You have to be calm to change back.  If your thinking is clouded, it won’t be possible for you to concentrate.”<br />
<br />
With that Kelvin looked at Tim, a bit sheepishly, sighed heavily and closed his big brown bear eyes.  He was trying to calm down and started breathing deeply.<br />
<br />
Tim did the same and started shifting back into human shape.<br />
<br />
When Tim didn’t speak for a minute or so, Kelvin opened one eye and saw that Tim was now almost completely back to his human shape.  Obviously Tim knew what he was talking about.  Kelvin closed his eyes again and waited for instruction.<br />
<br />
“OK,” Tim began, “imagine yourself shrinking, the fur on your body withdrawing into your skin and the fat being absorbed into your body.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin took an extra deep breath and concentrated, letting it out slowly.  He imagined his feet returning to normal, his hands becoming human hands, his muzzle pulling back into his skull and everything ursine pulling into his body.<br />
<br />
Tim watched closely.  At first, there was no change, but then Kelvin began to transform.  He watched as Kelvin reverted into the hybrid shape.  At this, Tim interrupted.<br />
<br />
“OK, stop.” Tim said.<br />
<br />
Kelvin opened his eyes.  He looked at his great muscular arms, still covered in fur but ending not in paws but in paw like clawed hands.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m not back to myself yet!”  Kelvin rumbled in a deep voice and slurring the words as Tim had.<br />
<br />
“I know,” Tim said and smiled his sharp toothed smile. “ I want you to feel and think about your body as it is now, it might come in useful to be in this half-form later.  Move around, just a little while you sit there and remember how it feels.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin had to admit, this form felt pretty damned good, in fact, the grizzly form felt good too.  The huge muscles and the big belly and the sheer power and weight of the grizzly form filled Kelvin’s mind with erotic thoughts.  Being as partial to bears as he was, he rather liked the idea having claws, fur and fangs as he fucked his partner. <br />
<br />
Tim sat in a chair and looked the bearman over.  “He’s so damned sexy!” Tim thought, “It would be so great if he was gay.  Maybe he’s bi.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin caught Tim looking.  Tim had a look on his face that Kelvin thought he recognized, but he wasn’t sure.  <br />
<br />
As soon as Kelvin had met Tim’s stare, Tim broke the contact.  After about three minutes or so and Kelvin said. “OK, how do I change back?”<br />
<br />
Tim said, “Close your eyes and just continue pulling the bear back into yourself.  I think you might have to face the fact that you and I could be bearmen for the rest of our lives.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin looked over his new body and snorted, “Well, I can think of worse things to be!  In fact, this might have some very distinct advantages.”<br />
<br />
“You better believe it, you sexy beast!” Tim thought.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I suppose it’s not all bad.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
Kelvin squeezed his eyes shut and concentrated again.<br />
<br />
Tim watched as the bear receded and left a very gorgeous naked man sitting on the remains of the old couch.  Kelvin’s hair and bushy beard had become chestnut brown.  Tim remembered his coloring was different this morning, if only slightly so.  He looked at Kelvin as he became a man again.  Kelvin was covered in thick dark body hair just as Tim was.  Tim noticed the man had a huge thick uncut cock, like his own.  Kelvin’s arms were massive, his neck was thick, his torso was like a barrel with a nice set of love handles and his legs were like sinewy, fur covered tree trunks.  He also noticed that all of Kelvin’s tattoos were gone.  <br />
<br />
He’d noticed with his own body, as he was showering, that the appendix scar he had was gone; something about the transformation ‘renewed’ the body and Tim suspected it healed damage.<br />
<br />
Kelvin opened his eyes and looked at himself.  He was human again, at least in looks, but his hair color had changed.  He was also completely naked and, embarrassed, he grabbed up the remains of his shirt and pants and covered his crotch.<br />
<br />
Kelvin blushed for the first time since he was twelve and had accidentally walked in on his dad in the bathroom, naked.  That was odd, he remembered his dad looked a lot like he did now, but he also remembered his dad being an averaged sized man with sandy blond hair.  “What’s happened to my memories?”  Kelvin thought<br />
<br />
Kelvin looked down at his arms and chest.  “Hey, what happened to my tats?”<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing they were destroyed when your skin changed, the change seems to have removed the scar from my appendix operation.  It’s also changed the way I look and, of course, my size and hairiness.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“See that picture over there with the old guy and the young man?”  Tim asked but didn’t look at the photo.<br />
<br />
Kelvin nodded but didn’t look at the picture, he’d seen it earlier and remembered the slightly built twink with the old Papa Bear.<br />
<br />
“That young man was me this morning.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“So was the old guy your father?”  Kelvin asked.<br />
<br />
“No, but he took me in and treated me well and I wished he was my father on many occasions.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s kind of funny that you aren’t his son, because you look like him.  There are a few differences, but I thought that was your mother’s side.”  Kelvin said.<br />
<br />
Tim took the picture.  The picture had changed.  In the picture, it was Tim as he looked now hugging his smaller, grey bearded father.  It was for his dad’s birthday a couple of years ago.  Tim walked into the bathroom.  He compared the photo of the old man and himself and his reflection in the mirror.  <br />
<br />
Kelvin was right, he did look like Hank and the incredible thing was that Tim remembered having the picture taken with Hank and wrapping his arms around his Dad.  He remembered the photographer having to readjust everything because he didn’t usually get such ‘big fellas’ in.  <br />
<br />
Tim found his wallet, dug out the driver’s license and looked at the picture.  The license read Tim Orff.  It gave his current height of 7’2”, his hair color brown, eye color, brown and weight of 350 lbs.  Born 1962 and the address here at the yard.  <br />
<br />
He was shocked.  Somehow, he’d become Hank’s son.  Not the one that was killed in Vietnam, no, that was Joe and he remembered how he, Hank and his mom had buried Joe’s remains when Tim was just a kid.  Tim Dane was the son the old guy had never had before, but Tim Orff was and had always been Hank’s son.  <br />
<br />
He looked into the mirror and could see the striking resemblance between the Hank and the big bearman with the sharp teeth looking back at him.  Hank’s hair had been jet black and Tim’s was now a dark brown, his big bushy beard was a couple of shades lighter, but there was no mistaking it, he was his father’s son.  He began to reflect on his childhood and in it he remembered having an older brother Joe who’d gone to Vietnam and died there. <br />
<br />
The weird part was he also had all his memories of his life as Tim Dane.  It was as if two people had become one and were peacefully sharing the same body.<br />
<br />
Kelvin was still holding the rags against his still very erect member as Tim walked back into the room.  <br />
<br />
Kelvin asked, “So what happened.”<br />
<br />
“It’s weird.” Tim said, “Hank was my dad, at least since about 10 am this morning when I touched the box.  It’s like a destiny that never was came into being and I stepped into it.  I’m willing to bet that Tim Dane doesn’t exist anymore, but I’m still Tim Dane, at least in my head.  I bet there are old photos of Joe and me, dad and mom in the albums I kept.  I don’t know why I kept them, I think I just couldn’t bear to throw away all the old guy’s memories.  Now, I seem to have memories of being his son.”  <br />
<br />
Tim noticed that Kelvin was sitting there, looking very awkward in his relative nakedness.  “Hey, let’s get you some clothes.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
Tim led Kelvin to his room.  Kelvin looked around the old bedroom and noticed a few things to bring up later.  He saw a black leather baseball cap with bear paw prints embroidered across it hanging from the mirror on Tim’s dresser.  The paw prints were in the color of the bear flag.  Kelvin also noticed an issue of US Bears magazine poking out from underneath some dirty clothes on the floor.  If Tim wasn’t gay before the change, he was now and he was one of the most gorgeous Bears Kelvin had ever seen.  <br />
<br />
US Bears had some of the most muscular, beefy, hairy, thickly bearded, pierced and tattooed bears in America; all nude and erect.  The one he saw on Tim’s floor, even though all he could see of it was a part of one of the corners, was the most recent issue and Kelvin knew it because he had a subscription.  Kelvin knew; he jacked off just this morning to the images of the Bears between its covers.<br />
<br />
Tim handed Kelvin a set of overalls, a white T-shirt and a big pair of tennis shoes.<br />
<br />
“There you go.”  Tim said, “The bathroom is just through that door.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin took the clothes in one hand and went to the bathroom to change.<br />
<br />
As Kelvin took his clothes to the bathroom, Tim went into the smaller bedroom he used when Hank was still alive.  Tim was surprised and yet not surprised to find that this room was now a ‘play’ room for sex and extra storage for his clothes.  The bed was wrapped in a durable plastic cover and had silk bonds to tie someone up attached to the sturdy wrought iron foot and headboards.  He looked in the closet and found that there were clothes that fit him.  There were tons of plaid shirts and jeans folded on the shelf above.  He even remembered buying most of them.  There were black biker boots, construction boots and different hats on the shelf with the jeans.  He saw a black Stetson cowboy hat, a black leather ball cap, like the other one with the paws but this one was plain and a genuine skull cap type motorcycle helmet bikers wear.  The clothing brought back memories of the sex he’d had in the room with big furry studs, after the yard was closed for the day.<br />
<br />
He looked in the top drawer of the old, beat up dresser and found lots of sex toys.  In the other drawers he found leather garments, harnesses and masks.  Tim remembered buying them from a very discreet and exclusive store that dealt in all manner of fetish wear and paraphernalia.  <br />
<br />
Apparently, Hank’s big burly bear son was a leather bear.  He thought about the man in his bathroom as he took out his Daddy Bear vest and sniffed it.  He fondled a leather jock strap and thought about Kelvin.  Tim’s cock was rock heard and he noticed he was beginning to grow fur again.  He put the vest and jock strap away and concentrated on returning to human form.  When he had shifted back, he walked out into the living room and waited for Kelvin.<br />
<br />
While Tim was going through the contents of his playroom, Kelvin was dressing.<br />
<br />
Kelvin, out of curiosity, rummaged through his ripped pants and found his wallet.  He took the cigars out of his shirt and put them in the pocket of his bib overalls.  He found his license and read it. <br />
<br />
Kelvin Hoskins, height of 7’0” his hair and eye color, both brown and weight of 310 lbs.  Born 1964.  <br />
<br />
The address was not the one he had this morning.  This address was a house, not the apartment he had rented two years ago, and a nice house too.  He remembered working on the houses in the subdivision where this house was when he was Kelvin Orcan.  Kelvin remembered signing the mortgage papers as Kelvin Hoskins.  Kelvin realized his life had been altered too.  He still rode a Harley, he still hung out in biker bars and he still was in construction, he still was very gay, but he realized he now owned a business that had been in operation since his father had built it.  His dad had turned it over to him only last year.  His parents were retired and living in Colorado.  <br />
<br />
This morning he was Kelvin Orcan, his dad had been n office manager, had hoped Kelvin would go to college.  He was disappointed when is only son had dropped out of high school and began working construction.  <br />
<br />
Kelvin now had distinct memories of his dad coming home after work.  His father, Andrew Hoskins, was rather big, but not as big as Kelvin was now and was hairy and muscular. He’d be dirty and worn out when he came home after a hard day working at the construction site.  Kelvin remembered he wanted to grow up to be just like his dad.  His father was his hero.  Kelvin had finished high school and began working for his father right after graduation.  Andrew taught his son everything he could about the business and left it in his son’s capable hands.<br />
<br />
Tim and Kelvin’s lives had been altered.  Not just that they were now some sort of magically created ‘werebear’, but that they now had different personal histories.<br />
<br />
Kelvin came out of the bathroom, dressed as Tim was and sat on the broken couch.<br />
<br />
“So, why did the box change us and our lives?”  Kelvin asked.<br />
<br />
“I dunno.”  Tim said.  “I was playing with that box this morning and it zapped me.  At first I just grew into a big hairy man, then I became that hybrid bear form you saw and then I changed completely into a bear.  It seems that it did the same to you, but it didn’t zap you and you seemed to change slower than I did.  I also notice the change was painful for you, but it wasn’t really that painful for me.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but what about our lives?  You became Hank’s son and I became the son of Andrew and Myrtle Hoskins.  I remember my mom’s name was Clara Orcan and my dad’s name was Oscar Orcan.  I remember getting my first tattoo and my father had a fit; my mom cried, but Andrew, my dad now, has a big ol’ skull tattooed on his shoulder and a panther on his right forearm.  You better believe I’m gonna get some of my tats back, some of ‘em were stupid and I wanted to get them covered with something cool, but others I just can’t stand living without.  For instance, that bear I had on my back.  I paid a lot of money for that grizzly’s face and sat for hours gettin’ it done; I want him back, I’ve grown rather attached to ol’ Bjorn.”<br />
<br />
“Bjorn?”  Tim asked.<br />
<br />
Kelvin looked a Tim a bit irritably and motioned with his thumb toward his back, “The Bear tattoo… haven’t you been listening?  I called him Bjorn, it’s a Norse name and it means 'bear'.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.”  Tim said, feeling a bit stupid.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, none of what used to be, before this morning, is true now.  Hell, we’ve changed into bears, for cryin’ out loud!  It’s just all so strange though, I must admit, I rather like being able to do that.  Still, it’s not normal.  What’s happened to us?”  Kelvin said.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.”  Tim said.  <br />
<br />
“So what is that box and where did it come from?”  Kelvin said.  He looked at the box on the coffee table, but all urges to touch the box had completely vanished from his mind, as though its work was done and Kelvin instinctively knew that he didn’t need to touch the box anymore.<br />
<br />
“Well, it came from an estate sale.  Apparently the guy who owned it disappeared and his relatives sold the stuff from his mansion off.”  Tim said<br />
<br />
“Disappeared… like Mafia disappeared?”  Kelvin said.<br />
<br />
“No, more like walked into another dimension, disappeared.”  Tim said.  “The old guy was considered to be a nut and dabbled in magic.  He’s written some books on magic, I even remember reading some of them.” <br />
<br />
“Magic?  Like human sacrifice, Voodoo, pentagrams?  Black magic?”  Kelvin asked.<br />
<br />
“No, nothing like that.  The guy was a parapsychologist and a magician… and there’s no such thing as ‘Black magic’, there’s just magic.  What people use it for determines if it’s evil or good.  Is a car evil if you use it to run people over or is the driver evil?”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“I’d never thought of it that way, but then I never thought magic was real until today.”  Kelvin said.<br />
<br />
“Well, I almost had a degree in it, but I couldn’t afford to finish.”  Tim said.  “At lease, I used to almost have a degree in it.  I’ve still got all the knowledge, but I don’t remember going to college as Tim Orff.  The man I am now stopped at high school.”  <br />
<br />
“I’ll do some research later, to try to find out what that box is.  I’ve got some idea as to which books to look in and where to find them, but they are rare and expensive books.  It’s also possible that it’s in the books I had set aside from the estate sale.  All books from estate sales go here in the house and I’ve got them in a big room upstairs.  I took them up before I started messing around with the box.  I know the books to start looking in, I saw a few of them in the collection I hauled upstairs.  If that box isn’t in them, I’ll have to look elsewhere.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“Well, I appreciate it, but think about it; do either of us want to go back to what we were?”  Kelvin asked.  “I know I’m happy with what I am now.”<br />
<br />
“No, I suppose not.”  Tim said, “But, still, it’s important to know what happened and what that thing is.  The box looks like it was made in India or China or Arabia in ancient times.  I really haven’t got a clue, though.  There are no words in any language on the box, I’m only going by the artwork, and it looks to be a blending of several ancient eastern cultures.”  Tim said contemplatively.<br />
<br />
Kelvin remembered something he wanted to ask.<br />
<br />
“So, Tim, I saw a black leather ball cap when you were getting me these clothes and I was wondering something.”  Kelvin said slyly.<br />
<br />
“Yes?”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“I’m an up front kinda guy.”  Kelvin said.  “I’m very attracted to you and I was wondering…”<br />
<br />
“Wondering what?”  Tim asked, but he had a good idea of what Kelvin was going to say next and his heart was racing, just a bit.<br />
<br />
“How would you like to close down the yard for today, put on some other clothes and that Bear ball cap hanging from your dresser and take ride on the back of my Harley with me around six or so, tonight?  How about we go to a nice Bear bar I know of across town; I’d like to spend some time getting to know you better.”  Kelvin said with a sexy grin.<br />
<br />
“And what will we do from now until six this evening?”  Tim asked with mock puzzlement on his face.<br />
<br />
Kelvin returned the quizzical look, “Why, I can’t imagine.  Perhaps you could think of something while you’re locking up, after all, I’m the guest and you’re the host.”<br />
<br />
Tim smiled.  “I’ll go take care of any customers that might be out in the yard, send Richard home with pay and lock the gate.”  Tim said, and thought of all that leather and those toys he kept in his spare bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Good.”  Kelvin said.  “I think I’m gonna go get my Hawg, then I’ll sit back and relax until you get back.  I’m going to call my foreman and let him know I’m not going to be available for the rest of the day and not to expect me in tomorrow.  Mind if I smoke a cigar while you’re gone?”<br />
<br />
Tim’s cock twitched, he loved cigar and pipe Bears.<br />
<br />
“Not at all!”  Tim said.  “Here, use this saucer as an ashtray.”<br />
<br />
With that, Tim hurried into the yard to close it for the day.  <br />
<br />
Kelvin lit up his cigar and walked back to his Harley.  He got on it and rode it back through the maze of junk and storage sheds and parked it outside of Tim’s house.  He got his cell phone out of the saddlebags and called his foreman, returning the phone after he used it.  He went back inside and stretched out on the dilapidated couch that groaned under his weight.  He puffed on his cigar and thought about all the kinky stuff he wanted to do to Tim before their night on the town.  <br />
<br />
Kelvin rubbed his aching crotch.  He was really in need of a good fuck.  He noticed that fur was beginning to grow on his arms.  He grunted as he began to change.  He stopped the change and reversed it and then he consciously began to change into a bear.  He realized that he was gaining much more control over his transformation.  Kelvin peeled his clothes off and the couch creaked and groaned under his increasing weight.<br />
<br />
He drew in on his cigar and thought, “Practice makes perfect and I want to practice a whole lot with, Tim’s cooperation, between now and this evening.”   Kelvin smiled broadly and continued to stroke his cock.</p>
