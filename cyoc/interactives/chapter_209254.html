<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Honey we&#39;re home!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha Davis paused in her cooking, a wide smile spreading across her face as she saw her husband and daughter now enter their home. Holding out her arms the young mother snickered as the 3 year old Tricia Davis literally flew into her arms. &quot;I take it this one had fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too much fun,&quot; Mike sighed. &quot;We kind of had to cut it shirt when someone decided to try and fly with her wings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tricia,&quot; Samantha stated firmly. &quot;What have I told you about hiding your wings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sorry mommy,&quot; Tricia replied sweetly. &quot;But I was having fun at the playground!&quot; Samantha chuckled, shaking her head as she now looked at her husband. Mike simply sighing in acceptance. &quot;I know that look,&quot; he grinned. &quot;She won you over again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be mad at this face,&quot; Samantha smiled. Mike simply shook his head placing a gentle kiss on his wives forehead. &quot;She is absolutely going to run over us in ten years.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Davis family now settled into their usual routine. Ever since the baseball season ended Mike Davis had made a point of spending as much time as possible with his family. After picking Tricia up from preschool, Mike would take the preschooler to the park. The girl racing around with wreckless abandon before returning home for dinner, a bath, and a bedtime story. Usually Tricia was able to keep her powers at bay, sometimes though the young girl would reveal her magical powers. Today was one of those days, the 3 year old growing a pair of golden dragon wings before leaping off the monkey bars. Mike had quickly grabbed his daughter, sprinting for the car and heading home. Thankfully Mike was able to secure the girl in about 30 seconds and no one appeared to be the wiser.<br />
<br />
As the Davis&#39;s now tucked their daughter into bed, they made their way downstairs. Grabbing a cup of coffee each the young parents now collapsed onto the couch as they began to search for something to watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I told you how much I love the off season,&quot; Samantha sighed, the wizard now useing her powers to levitate the remote to her. &quot;More than once,&quot; Mike smiled. &quot;But I still like when you say it.&quot; Samantha simply sighed, leaning her head against her husband&#39;s chest. She was going to savor all the time she would spend with Mike before Spring Training.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you hear something,&quot; Mike asked. Samantha paused, the dragonness transforming, the womans face becoming slightly feral. &quot;Now I do, &quot; she answered, her voice somewhat animalistic. &quot;What do you think? Raccoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Mike said softly. &quot;I&#39;ll check it out.&quot;  Mike now stood, slowly making his way towards the back door. Samantha now stood, something didn&#39;t feel right. The dragonness now began to transform further, the womans incisors becoming fangs, her height increasing along with her muscles giving her Amazonian proportions. Finally her hands began to thicken, her fingernails becoming claws as her feet formed into digigrade reptilian talons. Despite her fearsome appearance, the dragonness was nervous. She couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing out back,&quot; Mike called. Samantha nodded, appreciating her husband taking the time to look. As she was about to answer the young parents heard a gunshot, Samantha gasping as she crumpled to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;SAMMY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike now raced to his wives side, the dragon wizard finding herself short of breath as she gazed at the rather large bullet hole in her chest. Someone had shot at Samantha, amazingly piercing her dragon hide and leaving a sizable bullet hole on the right side of her chest. Mike was frightened, trying to stem the bleeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Family of dragons huh? Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen that before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike glanced upwards, his face contorting in rage. Standing in his front door was a rather large man, a cigar now slowly burning in his mouth. Cursing at the large man, he now began to transform. Mikes skin becoming solid steel as he now lunged at his wife&#39;s attacker.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be damn,&quot; Kane grinned. &quot;Not a dragon. A wizard. Whats a human doing mating with a dragon whore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll kill you,&quot; Mike roared, the man now useing his magic to hurl metallic objects at Ezekiel Kane. Kane simply smirked, despite his size, he was rather quick on his feet. &quot;Tougher cunts than you have tried,&quot; he grinned. &quot;But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure you end up just like your whole wife and kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike continued his attack, growing frustrated by this strangers evasiveness. As the man now pointed a sawed off shotgun at him, Mike charged. Kane simply gave the man a malicious grin as he now pulled the trigger.<br />
<br />
Mike doubled over, it felt like he had been punched in the chest. Touching his metallic chest, Mike was shocked as he found he was now bleeding. Whatever the guy had shot him with had pierced his metallic skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tougher than you look,&quot; Kane grumbled. A grin of pure malice now spread across his face as he now leveled his gun at a prone Samantha. &quot;Wonder if your bitch is as tough as you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike screamed diving in front of Samantha taking the brunt of the blast. The young man now tumbled backwards, coughing up blood. The last shot had peeled away even more of Mikes metallic skin, blood freely flowing onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Kane simply raised an eyebrow, chuckling softly as he watched Mike now crawl towards his wife. Whatever this dragon had done to win this wizards loyalty must have been life changing. He was willing to lay down his life to protect her. Still, it would all be for nothing. Ezekiel was going to kill them all eventually and right now he could see his next victim.<br />
<br />
All the noise appeared to have woken the couples child. Kane immediately recognized the preschooler, she looked very much like her mother. After rolling into town, he had caught a glimpse of the child at the playground. It had surprised the hunter to see a dragon child freely playing with human children. Despite her fathers best efforts  Kane had seen what the girl was. Now this child was standing at the top of the stairs, frozen in fright as she stared at the man who had attacked her parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here kid,&quot; Kane smirked. &quot;Ol Ezekiel Kane got a present for you.&quot; Kane now slowly withdrew a knife from his belt, he was going to enjoy killing a family of wizards and dragons.<br />
<br />
The sound of police sirens now caused Kane to curse under his breath. Thhe house must have had a silent alarm, alerting the police after Kane had broken in. He hated leaving a job half done but he knew that if the cops showed up he wouldn&#39;t be able to finish his work. Turning towards the door, Kane now glanced down at the bleeding and barely conscious Mike and Samantha, flashing them a sinister smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be seeing ya,&quot; he grinned as he now vanished into the night.</p>
