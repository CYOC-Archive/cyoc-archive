<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually, after a minute or two of trekking through the halls of my family&#39;s manor, we finally made it to the bedroom that Molly and I reside in. In appearance, it was rather spacious, even before my beloved Molly was transformed into a thousand pound, seven and a half foot anthropomorphic cow. <br />
<br />
However, when we had Molly living with me and my family, we had to take... &quot;certain measures&quot;, to make sure that Molly felt comfortable during her stay here. It included replacing my previous bed with a much more sturdier, comfier, and overall larger bed. After all, I&#39;m pretty sure Molly would&#39;ve completely busted my previous bed if we still used it due to her increased size and girth. <br />
<br />
The new bed we had set up had a bed frame that was made out of Titanium, which will definitely hold up and withstand all one thousand pounds of my bovine girlfriend. We had to use a special made mattress for the bed, which was essentially two Queen-Sized mattresses literally fused together. Hell, even the bedsheets and pillows had to be supersized to accommodate for the extra weight Molly now hefted around these days.<br />
<br />
Anyway, getting back to the situation at hand, I assisted Molly in stripping the hot pink nightgown from her bovine form, then proceeded to help her out of her purple bras and panties, which left her completely nude, with her white and black fur acting as a temporary substitute for decency. <br />
<br />
From there, I helped Molly with getting her into a custom-built bathtub and shower stall, as I soon stripped myself of my own clothes to assist in bathing her. The bathing stall itself was substantially larger than the typical home shower stall, as it could easily fit a total of ten people inside. <br />
<br />
Or, in our case, a half ton, seven and a half foot tall anthropomorphic bovine and her still human boyfriend. Although, one could say that being an anthropomorphic cow certainly had a downside or two. Though, in this case, Molly now had to use a helluva lot more shampoo in order to fully clean herself, a whole two to three bottles worth. Thankfully, Molly&#39;s black and white cow fur was considerably much shorted than her blonde human hair, which meant using less shampoo than what she would use for her hair. <br />
<br />
Of course, these days Molly had grown out her hair, which was now long enough to extend to just above where the beginning of her tail would be. However, I wasn&#39;t just participating in the shower alongside my girlfriend out of giving her moral support. Apparently, due to her substantially larger physique, she would sometimes have trouble reaching some areas to properly wash and bathe. <br />
<br />
And no, this wasn&#39;t a snide remark at her weight either. Though, as for which places she would have some major difficulty cleaning, that would be her udder, her nether regions, the undercarriage of her billowing caboose, and the bottoms of her considerably large hind hooves. But as the steamy warm shower water poured down both of us, I calmly cleaned the underside of her somewhat saggy udder, as her massive bovine mammary was position just a finger away from her privates. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, thanks to milking her udder earlier, Molly&#39;s exercise ball-sized udder was undoubtedly much lighter and easier to maneuver through when it came to bodily hygiene, as I used one hand to gently lift up the sagging udder, while having my other hand properly clean the underside of her udder, as well as the surface of her privates.<br />
<br />
Of course, upon me touching her nether regions with a soap-covered hand, Molly mewled out a surprised but mildly aroused &quot;Moo!&quot; in the process, where I then moved my head out from under her udder and queried, &quot;Everything alright, Molly?&quot; &quot;...I&#39;m fine, (Name). It&#39;s just that, um...I-I&#39;m still a bit sensitive down there from being milked earlier.&quot; She elaborated, twiddling her hoof-like fingers subconsciously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Sorry about that. I guess I should&#39;ve expected that by now.&quot; I apologized, as I then began to wash the inner sides of her thick thighs with careful and loving precision, just as I heard Molly sheepishly reply, &quot;Oh no, it&#39;s okay, sweetie! Just...try and be more careful when you&#39;re cleaning my privates after I just got done milking my udder.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;*chuckle* I promise, honey.&quot; I firmly answered, just as I had finished washing Molly&#39;s right thigh, then began to clean her left thigh. Suffice to say, Molly certainly found it relaxing when I was helping her bathe. She felt like she was being pampered like a princess.<br />
<br />
Shortly after that, I soon repositioned myself toward her billowing gluteus maximus, as each buttcheeks was basically the size of a puffy beanbag chair. Perky, voluminous, weighty, and full of heft. It was one of my favorite parts of her current form, in all honesty, as I gave coyly gave her burgeoning buttocks a few light yet playful smacks, which caused Molly&#39;s bovine tail to swish about sporadically in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;*giggle* Liking the view back there? Careful there, sweetie, or I might just think about giving you a closer look at this fatty derriere of mine.&quot; Molly jokingly teased, obviously enjoying how much attention I was clearly giving her at the moment, even though she was now capable of lifting me over her head with little effort. <br />
<br />
Of course, I certainly wasn&#39;t complaining, as I continued to thoroughly wash each individual buttcheeks until it was soft as silk, despite it being wet from the shower. In a way, all this flirting she made made it feel like she was still the same old Molly Rhoer I fell in love with prior to her transformation. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Okay, time to clean under your hooves.&quot; I said, prompting Molly to calmly sit upon a heavily reinforced stool installed in the shower stall. From there, as she lifted up a thick bovine leg to show the underside of her left hindhoof, I went over to the side of the stall, which had a compartment that contained the necessities to properly clean cow hooves, which included a heavy-duty hand brush, as well as industrial bodywash that my parents&#39; company had developed meant to dissolve any dirt or gunk buildup underneath Molly&#39;s hind hooves, as well as preventing the keratin (The stuff that hooves are primarily made out of) wouldn&#39;t start developing any cracks or fractures that could harm her.<br />
<br />
First, I poured out the industrial bodywash onto the handbrush, spreading the stuff out evenly along the handbrush. Then, I carefully held up Molly&#39;s hind hoof and began to thoroughly scrub the bottom of the hoof, as it began to dissolve the unhealthy gunk from the bottom of Molly&#39;s hoof. You can say that it was like giving her a homemade pedicure, a pedicure for cows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now for the other hoof.&quot; I calmly said, as Molly promptly lowered her now clean left hindhoof, then raised her right hindleg, showing her right hindhoof. From there, I then proceeded to do the same with her right hindhoof, making sure it was properly scrubbed and cleaned. Fortunately, I didn&#39;t have to clean her thick hoof-like fingers as often as her hind hooves, since she makes sure not to get them dirty. <br />
<br />
Finally, after I got myself cleaned off (with some minor assistance from Molly), Molly and I soon turned off the shower and exited the large shower stall, where I then began to help Molly dry herself off. Of course, it was a bit more difficult to dry off Molly&#39;s bovine fur due to it soaking up the water like a sponge. Fortunately, her udder was much easier to dry off, since it wasn&#39;t covered with fur.<br />
<br />
Of course, due to how somewhat loose, saggy, and sensitive it was, it made Molly giggle a lot as I relentlessly dried off the bovine mammary with a sofa-sized towel. Thankfully for Molly, I had just finished drying off her udder, where I then began to dry off  each of her hind hooves as if I was polishing a pair of business shoes. <br />
<br />
Once that was done, Molly began to dry herself off, using a custom towel that was approximately the size of an SUV, which left me to dry myself off with another towel. &quot;...So, I just got a call the other day while you were busy.&quot; Molly promptly said, as I noticed her starting up the conversation. <br />
<br />
Of course, I keenly listened to what my girlfriend had to say, obviously becoming curious in the process, as I began to spike up my short hair with some styling gel while I curiously asked, &quot;...Oh really? So, who was it from, Molly?&quot;<br />
<br />
From there, shortly after clearing up her throat, instinctively letting out a light &quot;Moo&quot; mewl in the process, Molly then spoke to me and explained...</p>
