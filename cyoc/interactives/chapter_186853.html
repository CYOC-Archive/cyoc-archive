<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three women cleaned up the mess Margret had made before returning to the lobby and waited until it was their turn for a consultation, Gemma holding Margret&#39;s flaccid cock near the base so that she didn&#39;t float all the way to the ceiling . After a few minutes a nurse entered, but unlike the staff at the entrance, who simply wore hazmat suits to prevent themselves from being infected it seemed that this nurse was a mutant herself. She looked to be about six feet tall, but trailing behind her was a long snake tail that went on all the way back through the door she entered from, over ten feet from where the three patients were sitting (or floating in Margret&#39;s case). Above the waist she was mostly normal, however she did have three pairs of arms growing down the side of her torso. She was wearing lose-fitting scrubs typical of her profession, but hers had been modified to accommodate her form, the top had extra sleeves and the typical long pants had been replaced with a skirt made out of the same material that covered her tail down to around what would be “ankle length” on a non mutated human.<br />
<br />
“Your Margret, Isaac, and Gemma, correct?” The nurse asked them, once they had confirmed their names, she continued<br />
<br />
“Allow me to explain whats going to happen, now that you&#39;re inside the quarantine zone, which includes this entire wing of the hospital as well as the nearby hotel that non-urgent patients will be staying at, all staff will be mutants like me for safety reasons. Since there&#39;s not that many mutants working here non-mutant staff had to handle arrivals but it was deiced that only mutant staff should be inside, even if it means we&#39;re a little understaffed to handle an outbreak this big.” The nurse took a quick break to look over both the three women in-front of her as well as some papers she had in one of her hands.<br />
<br />
“Alright with that out of the way, follow me to the examination rooms so that you can have your private consultations as well as receive a dose of the medicine.” The nurse waited for them to get up before she began slithering off back the way she came. The three women followed behind her, with Margret being pulled behind by her cock. Isaac noticed that even with the nurses tail now going ten feet both ways, the end of it was nowhere in sight. As they made their way to the examination rooms they passed by several other staff members and patients, all noticeably mutated in some way.<br />
<br />
When they arrived at the examination rooms they were each sent to separate rooms, with Margret being taken to her room by the nurse. Each room was already occupied by a mutant doctor who quickly began their physical examination, wanting to get through the large amount of patients waiting in the lobby. Once the doctors finished examining their patient they gave some general advice based on similar cases recorded from previous outbreaks, with warnings that the mutations liquid works differently from everyone and to come back to the hospital if they have any issues in the future. Once tier consultation was over the doctors gave them a dose of the medicine customized to their new form. With their examinations over, Isaac, Gemma, and Margret were escorted by the same lamia nurse out to a sectioned off part of the parking. From there they were loaded on to a transport and taken to a hotel down the road, who had volunteered to help quarantine patients that the hospital didn&#39;t have enough room for.<br />
<br />
The hotel had been built recently, so it had many special accommodations for mutants that older buildings didn&#39;t. These extra accommodations also meant that many mutants worked their, meaning that even with the quarantine restrictions their was still enough staff to keep the hotel running smoothly. The three women were greeted at the front desk by a pair of mutant receptionists who had been fused together side-by-side. Both of their feminine heads rested atop their wide torso with four equally sized breasts in one row and two pairs of arms at each side. After confirming their status as recently transformed mutants, the three women were asked if they wanted separate rooms or if a shared one would be fine. Since Margret couldn&#39;t really move around by herself as she was they decided to share one room.<br />
<br />
Once they were in their room the three of them finally had a chance to relax, with Gemma and Isaac claiming one of the king-sized beds while they let Margaret float up to the ceiling. The beds, as well as the rest of the room&#39;s furniture, were waterproofed, allowing Isaac to not worry about damaging anything as she learned to control her liquid body.<br />
<br />
“So, how did your examinations go? My doctor was really nice, she also had her vagina replaced with a cocks, though it was only two normal sized human ones. Apparently lots of women who have their vaginas replaced with a cock experience a bit of dysphoria so she was able to help me come to terms with the fact that despite my new horsecocks I&#39;m just as much a woman as I was before. Their wasn&#39;t really that much advice on the physical side however, just to make sure to ejaculate frequently to make sure my balls don&#39;t get backed up and to make sure to be wary of prostate cancer since I now have a prostate.” Gemma recalled, looking towards her two roommates to hear their stories.<br />
<br />
“My doctor had a bunch of fox tails coming from her butt, and a pair of fox ears as well, and she gave me some really good news. Apparently there&#39;s a good chance I can regain some independence. With lots of practice I might be able to partially deflate myself which would allow me to move around without having to be dragged by someone, and she said that she might be able to get me signed up for a trial of new limb enhancing prosthetics that would make up for my lack of arms. If everything works out, I&#39;ll still be able to teach!” Margret exclaimed, the joy in her voice causing the others to smile as well. Gemma and Margret then looked to Isaac expectantly and the cum-girl began her story.<br />
<br />
“My doctor was a man who had been turned into his wife&#39;s cock, which made it a little awkward at first, but his advice was pretty helpful, he said that since I was made out of cum I probably don&#39;t need to eat anymore, though some people who get turned to liquid apparently still can. He mentioned that most people in situations like mine need to absorb the liquid they&#39;re made out of to sustain themselves, but I was covered by cum in the parking lot and I was inside Margret&#39;s balls and  I didn&#39;t feel like I could absorb any of it.” Isaac said, a confused look on her face.<br />
<br />
“Maybe since you were transformed into my cum, that&#39;s the only thing you can absorb?” Gemma offered, her cocks beginning to harden at the though of how they would test her theory.</p>
