<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While her boyfriend was on the second story of the building she was standing outside of transforming into a Lamia, Olivia eyes was darting around the empty street for any sign of anything. She tried to hide it but she was scared out of her mind, nothing made sense they had just been working on some stupid project for an art class she only signed up for because it was a requirement and wasn’t at 8am like the other art classes. Then suddenly Mike and the others, whom she hadn’t even met before starting this class and likely wouldn’t have seen again once they left school had found themselves in this abounded ancient city in the desert. Her mind was racing trying to figure it out, she couldn’t wrap her mind around it. The only horrifying idea that made any sense was that they had died and where now in hell, however she didn’t feel dead and if this was hell it was a mild version of hell.<br />
<br />
She took out her bottle of water from her book bag, that had come with them wherever they are and that was one of the reasons she didn’t think they were in hell. Why would going to hell allow you to bring your stuff with you. <br />
<br />
She took a long pull from the water bottle as she turned around to look at the door waiting for Mike to come through a figure appeared before her. Her lips where still on the bottle when it reached out and touched her chest before disappearing. She dropped the bottle letting the water soak into the sand. <br />
<br />
“What the?” inquired Olivia as she wondered for a moment if she was imagining something. She reached down to pick the water bottle up only to have it turn into sand as she lifted it off the ground. She blinked as she suddenly felt sand fall over her, her clothes and everything else she had had turned into sand and leaving her totally in the nude in the middle of the street. She reached up to cover herself before she fell forward into the sand. <br />
<br />
She lay in the sandy street for a second as she rolled over and sat up and noticed that she was in the nude. Her hands shot out as one hand covered her breasts while the other shot down to cover her pussy. Her eyes darted around for her clothes and saw nothing. She got up and bolted into the house where she knew her boyfriend was. <br />
<br />
She had just got inside and stumbled again, this time was because her legs had started to merge together. She fell into the sand and as she tried to push off the ground her body shook, she instead rolled over as she heard moaning coming from upstairs, she somehow knew It was Mike and those moans of pleasure was like a call to her. <br />
<br />
She got back up and began to move forward, her legs quickly merging together and lengthening out until her just over 5 feet height would have been 10. She had never felt so horny and listening to her boyfriend moan and moan her name only made it worse. She moved to the “stairs” which where impossible for her to climb as a human, it was a 45 degree angle slab of stone which was almost totally smooth and when she tried to climb it as a human she slid down it. She moved on it only to find she was moving up it with ease.<br />
<br />
She looked down and noticed her legs were gone and instead were merged into a single limb and that limb was quickly being covered with scales, scales which gripped into the stone in ways no human legs could hope to do. <br />
<br />
She moved up into the room and saw Mike was lying on some kind of sunning rock however his body had changed. He had always been muscular but now he was ripped in ways she could only have fantasized about. The fact that he was now a blue snake man with a scale covered tail and hands somehow made her even more horny and desperate for him.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened as she saw how his manhood had grown as she moved toward him a smile forming on her face, that smile showed her new fanged teeth.<br />
<br />
As she slithered forward her body changed, every fault in her skin, every scar and blemish disappeared. Her black hair became smoother and fuller as a permanent beauty makeup formed on her face. Some bright crimson red scales appeared along her neckline. Her bust grew a bit as her B cups turned into Cs as some scales appeared directly under them. The same scales grew over her hands up her arms to about midway toward her elbow. Pitch black scales grew over the front of her tail running down the length while the same crimson red scales appeared on the sides and back. <br />
<br />
“Mike….” She hissed as her boyfriend reached him climax, as his dick sprayed out his seed. <br />
<br />
“Olivia…” he moaned as she went down on his still hard manhood slipping it into her new scaled women hood. She began to ride him, his dick hardening again and filling her with pleasure. His tail wrapped around her own helping hold her up as they both moaned each other’s names neither of them fulling realizing what they had become yet. <br />
<br />
After a while and multiple positions both climaxed for the final time as Mike fell down on the coiled Olivia and tenderly kissed the back of her neck, moving some of her black hair aside to do so earning a solft moan from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Olivia.&quot; he said more then half asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Mike.&quot; she returned her eyes also filled with sleep  as the two of them coiled up together on the rock. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, the climaxed of pleasure began to pass as both of them realized what had just happened. Almost as one they opened their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot;  said Olivia</p>
