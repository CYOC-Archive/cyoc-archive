<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: I know a lot of this seems &quot;out of season&quot; but given the flow of time in the plot... well... it just seems that we're there.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You two have been living together and you haven't bought a proper bed?!&quot; my mother gasped in the Helena steakhouse that we had gone to after graduating.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were mostly hoping to budget some things out so that way we didn't bankrupt ourselves,&quot; I said weakly, &quot;we were mostly living off of Molly's work as an aide, which doesn't pay her all that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I gave you some paychecks too, remember that,&quot; Dave teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I'll owe you a favor for looking after Molly for me,&quot; I replied with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it wasn't that hard,&quot; Dave commented, &quot;Beauregard, I think has some connections and is waiting to see if you graduate or not. If not... Molly's aide job and my employing you at my vineyard wouldn't give you the financial means to hold onto Bandhavgarh Cabin... especially since from what I got it will count as a gift for this year's taxes. Your salary with the police will cover it though... I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mention of Beauregard's name changed the subject of the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe a man would behave that way,&quot; my father spoke in a disapproving voice, &quot;or that your Uncle would stick with such a man when he blatantly goes after someone's relatives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Wayne, as far as George and I are concerned, I have no relatives,&quot; Molly said with a low growl, &quot;my parents treated me like a zoo animal, and my uncle tried to help Beauregard use me as &quot;hit-animal&quot; against the local natural predators. The only one who has stuck with me and treated me with respect has been George. And through him, I can say I've made friends with Mrs. Choir...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tabby,&quot; Dave corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Tabby, short for Tabitha,&quot; Molly corrected, &quot;and if things go well... through George, I could have you as in-laws... but as far as my blood family is concerned... they can jump off a cliff for all I care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can't believe he would do that to you,&quot; my father answered, &quot;it isn't right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know it isn't,&quot; I told him, &quot;but I guess some people just aren't good people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn't you have told the Police Chief exactly what Beauregard wanted Molly to do?&quot; my father asked, &quot;a lot of it sounds like poaching.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; I sighed, &quot;but, he sold it as a method of protecting his cattle from attack. That these animals were attacking his cattle...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I've seen some cougar prints in the area,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;no wolves around Bandhavgarh Cabin that I'e seen, and no bears either... but there have been some cougars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that by claiming that Molly would be defending his cattle from attack, the poaching issue would be sidestepped,&quot; I finished, &quot;of course, it would also depend on Molly reporting the kill as foiling an attack on livestock or a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's still a conspiracy,&quot; my father pointed out, &quot;from what you've said, his intention was for Molly to actively hunt these animals, and then claim they were attacking his livestock.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;that's true, but outside of me and Molly's testimony, there is no evidence of it, and he would lawyer up and say it's our word against his.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that isn't a legal battle I want to fight, as I fear the people on the bench will support him because I'm an &quot;animal&quot;,&quot; Molly added.<br />
<br />
My parents sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us work to change the things we can change,&quot; my mother spoke, &quot;and I refuse to allow the two of you to sleep on the floor!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're on two mattresses,&quot; I corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not on a bed,&quot; my mother answered, &quot;Mr. Choir...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Dave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Dave, you are free to return to your family,&quot; my mother said authoritatively, &quot;George, Molly, if you intend to live together and be a couple together and eventually become man and wife together, you will need some proper bedding. I will not have you living like savages.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was my father that gulped, which made me nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow, we will buy for you and your girlfriend a bed and have it shipped to this Badivgarr,&quot; my mother continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bandhavgarh,&quot; Molly corrected, &quot;we named the cabin after a park in India.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A park?&quot; my father asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their version of Yellowstone or Glacier,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;Bandhavgarh is connected heavily with Project Tiger. And since I'm stuck this way... our cabin is MY Bandhavgarh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless,&quot; my mother finished, &quot;you will have a proper bed to sleep in and that is final.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay,&quot; Molly and I said weakly.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
We ended up making our way to Kalispell to get the bed. Thankfully the roads were good, so we had no trouble in getting there. The shopping for a bed, however, was still a surprise for the retailer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think we have any beds that would accommodate your height, madam,&quot; the man said nervously as Molly looked at a queen sized bed with me standing beside her, and my parents nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as my legs can dangle off of the end I'll be fine,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;my primary concern is whether or not it can hold my weight and George's as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Many of our models were factory tested to hold weight of up to 800 pounds,&quot; the man replied, &quot;and some even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good,&quot; Molly answered as she looked at the bed closer and then sat on the edge of the bed, being careful not to let her feet touch their sheets and blankets, &quot;what was the weight test on this one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maxed out at 978 pounds,&quot; the salesman answered, &quot;it's also a fairly common model. If you and this young man are an item and intend to stay together wouldn't you want something a bit more... beautiful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't look that bad to me,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it isn't a bad bed, but it is of a very plain design,&quot; the salesman replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong with a plain design,&quot; I told him, &quot;and with the budget I'm on, it is the most affordable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll help you pay for it, son,&quot; my father spoke supportively, &quot;you've done so much to help Molly, it's only fair that we help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; I replied, &quot;but all the same, it's Molly's choice. I want what she wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly's ears perked at the remark, but I didn't fully notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll go with this one,&quot; Molly said, pointing the bed she was sitting on.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fine choice, Mrs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now is only Ms.&quot; Molly told him, &quot;George hasn't gotten around to proposing yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the salesman gave a disapproving glance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not proposing in the store,&quot; I answered nervously, &quot;it doesn't seem romantic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; the salesman continued, &quot;if you will come with me, we can handle the paperwork for the purchasing of this model and make the arrangements for its delivery to your cabin. If all goes well, it should arrive sometime tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tonight?&quot; my mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have come in late in the day,&quot; the salesman answered, &quot;we close in about an hour. Driving a delivery truck to a rural cabin is not a wise idea at night. Bad roads and small spaces... our truck could end up in the ditch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll managed,&quot; my father assured him.<br />
<br />
The salesman nodded and then turned to lead us to his office. Even with my back turned, it felt like I could feel my mother shooting daggers into my back with her eyes. She may be more used to the idea of me living far away from her and excited about the prospect of marrying Molly, but something told me that a &quot;monster&quot; had been born in the process.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a nice looking cabin,&quot; my father commented as we began to walk in after we arrived at Bandhavgarh Cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it looks like we can plug the cars in,&quot; my mother commented from behind me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. York had intended for this to be his daughter's permanent home before she moved to a different town,&quot; I told them, &quot;it's conversion into a summer cabin and hunting lodge came after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was still very generous of him to help you and Molly,&quot; my father spoke.<br />
<br />
We then made our way in, and I gave my parents the tour while Molly went to collect the extension cords to plug in our vehicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can unfold the couch for tonight,&quot; I told my father, &quot;tomorrow when the bed arrives we can set you and mom up in the guest bedroom upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
My father nodded. My mother didn't look pleased that Molly and I would be &quot;on the floor&quot; but she said nothing at that time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll need to report to the city police chief to let him know, tomorrow,&quot; I told my father as we began unfolding the couch, &quot;but I don't think I'll be too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
My father nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next morning I met with Officer Harold in his office. Another officer was present.<br />
<br />
&quot;I congratulate you and graduating,&quot; Officer Harold said with a smile, &quot;and hopefully you'll do well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you won't actually start until January second, and then on a training basis,&quot; Officer Harold spoke, &quot;to allow you to enjoy the holidays. On the second, you'll be partnered with Frederick Baines, here. He will show you the ropes and will let you get used to your assigned area in Columbia Falls.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;hello, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Baines only nodded in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;The training sessions will go on for a couple of months to let you learn the ropes,&quot; Officer Harold then said, &quot;once that is done, you and Officer Baines will alternate your shifts together as you see fit. I hope the two of you can work well together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do my best, sir,&quot; Officer Baines spoke while I nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, &quot;Officer Wayne&quot;, have a Merry Christmas,&quot; Officer Harold said to me with a smile.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I returned to Bandhavgarh Cabin to see the delivery truck leaving. As I entered, I could hear rustling sounds upstairs and found my mother setting up a small artificial tree in our living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are things going?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They brought the bed in a little after you left to meet your chief,&quot; my mother answered, &quot;your father and Molly are setting up the guest beds right now, and I thought I'd help a little to get you both ready for the holidays.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at the artificial tree and the small collection of trimmings and ornaments, which had been part of the things my parents had sent to Molly and I when we informed them of our permanent home here.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks good,&quot; I told her, &quot;do you need any help?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The holidays arrived fairly quick. What Molly and I didn't have much, and thus couldn't offer much to my folks, but they seemed to take pride in our happiness together. On Christmas Day, I had learned that Molly had done some shopping for both us in the way of a few things for my folks. It made me feel embarrassed as I didn't have anything to give anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was a fine gift, dear,&quot; my mother smiled looking a framed photograph of Molly and I seated in front of our cabin, &quot;you didn't have to do this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a little something for you to remember us by,&quot; Molly told my mother, making me feel even more embarrassed, as she had even given me some things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry I didn't have all that much to give you, Molly,&quot; I said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to give me anything,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;I have you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still feel like I should be able to give you something,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't,&quot; Molly insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; I said firmly standing up, making Molly and my parents jump to their feet, &quot;you've done all of this for me and my folks. It's not fair that I...&quot;<br />
<br />
I then approached Molly slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe there is something...&quot; I said as I took one of Molly's paw-like hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; I spoke and moved down to one knee...<br />
<br />
Molly gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my...&quot; my mother spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly Rhoer... I'll love until the day I die,&quot; I spoke, &quot;I have no ring to offer you... but would you do me the honor of making me the happiest man on Earth? Would you marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly's answering roar was heard for miles.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot;</p>
