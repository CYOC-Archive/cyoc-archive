<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">School for Peter was very different from his previous years, no doubt about it. When he was human, jocks would be waiting to snatch his glasses for keep away. Now, it was like no jocks recognized him. When they learned that the male turtle Animalian was the one they &quot;played&quot; with all the time, they were so stunned, they barely noticed when he walked away from them unil five minutes later.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
During the remedial lessons of his four girls, the scientists were able to discern some personality traits that would make it easier to identify them:<br />
<br />
Lina could best be described as the &quot;friendly tomboy&quot; who excelled at sports. She was also rather smart, but not as smart as the others.<br />
<br />
Reva was the &quot;hardcore tomboy&quot; of the group. She excelled in sports more than Lina, but a &#39;character flaw&#39; was her moderate mood swings she had sometimes.<br />
<br />
Dela was the &quot;geek&quot; of the group, enjoying science fiction movies and video games. She was also a bit of a &#39;ninja otaku&#39;, to use the Japanese term, but she often irritated Reva with her antics.<br />
<br />
Mara was the &quot;brain&quot; of the group, scoring the highest of the four in the mandatory IQ test that was part of the remedial lessons. She was also a bit absent-minded, but that was to come with such a high score in intelligence.<br />
<br />
But the only thing that mattered to Peter was that they all loved him and each other, although it was a bit of a surprise for his parents that Peter was now an Animalian with four female turtle Animalians in his bed, rather than four turtles in an aquarium. It was also a good thing that the also enjoyed playing combative video games, especially the martial arts video games, but it was a bit of a pain to teach them about the video games, especially why some characters in games such as King of Fighters were somewhat &quot;bouncy&quot;. But his parents were glad that Peter was healthier than he originally was, and they bought the girls pendants with the first initial of their names on them so Peter was better able to tell them apart.<br />
<br />
What was really surprising for Peter was that the girls had &#39;conspired&#39; to convert his parents as a kind of Christmas gift for him (after they learned what Christmas was) and his parents were in on it, and double dosed each other as their Christmas gift to each other. His mother was now slightly taller, and somewhat curvier than the girls, while his dad was a head taller than him and substantially more muscular than him. But all together it was a good thing that they were now a family of turtle Animalians, he just wished that his parents didn&#39;t mate with each other for half the night while he was trying to sleep.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
At school, Peter excelled at gym class, which he was normally exempt from due to health reasons. While he wasn&#39;t the fastest of the Jocks, he could outstrip them all in any category, except for those who were Animalians when they came to school. The gym teacher, Mr. Williams, himself a Green Iguana Animalian, was impressed with all the jock records he was breaking and gave him a key to the weight room and him and his girls free access to it during his free periods.<br />
<br />
In the weight room, he was breaking records right and left with the weights, free or machine. For example, before his uplifting, he would only manage five chin-ups before an asthma attack, but now he was capable of doing fifty chin-ups with thirty pounds chained to his waist. When he learned about the IAC Bodybuilding Competition, he immediately signed up for the Middleweight division. Mr. Williams was very helpful with teaching him his poses, and he was sure he could smoke the other competitors in the Middleweight Reptilian division.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in school, he had to fend off the jock-chasing girls who gravitated towards anyone big and muscular and seemed to forget that they had boyfriends on the sports teams. His girls were also a great help with fending them off, by kindly &#39;reminding&#39; them, in a nonviolent, slightly threatening (for Reva) way that he was off-limits and belonged to them.<br />
<br />
Originally, Peter would have shunned the men&#39;s locker room like the plague, but this time he was still nervous about it, but still ready to enter it. To his great surprise, many of the jocks there treated him as an equal, complimenting him on his muscles. One of them even gave him a friendly chest rub, something he definitely wasn&#39;t used to. But after a few days of this, he got used to it.  What disappointed both him and his girls was that males and females couldn&#39;t share the same locker rooms. After gym, at least one of the girls would complain about someone putting things in her shell while she was showering, and Peter knew that someone would be using drones to get naked pictures of her without her consent.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Claw Coliseum, when it finally opened, was a great place for physical activity. There was also a newly added Records wall where Animalians who had completed impressive feats would have their name and feats recorded for posterity/bragging rights. It was a good thing to see Peter&#39;s name in the Male Middleweight Accomplishments section, when he wouldn&#39;t have been up in any records before his conversion due to health.<br />
<br />
When the Golden Mountain Dojo opened up, Peter and his girls immediately signed up for martial arts classes, but they were mainly about mixed martial arts that complemented their species strength, and not merely about ninjutsu, much to Dela&#39;s slight disappointment. <br />
<br />
All in all, Peter&#39;s life had definitely taken an upswing since his conversion. But the only thing he cared about was loving his four girls, who didn&#39;t mind sharing him with each other.</p>
