<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lady Odayakana took a breathe, focusing on her target. Letting loose with her arrow, the Lady of Shimizu watched as her arrow struck her target.<br />
<br />
Since arriving in the capital of the kitsune kingdom, the two tail kitsune vixen found herself engaged in negotiations with the celestial lord and lady. It was a tad overwhelming for the young vixen. Odayakana for her entire life had resided within on northern lands of the Shimizu, her grandfather acting as the official head of state. That is until his passing. Once that occurred, Hinata was proclaimed the leader of the Shimizu, making Odayakana&#39;s duties more ceremonial.<br />
<br />
Now though, Odayakana found herself ruling the Shimizu once more. Hinata was gone, Tatsu and Shizen not disclosing the fate of the celestial. Entering the kingdom of the dragon, Odayakana expected to find herself thrown in the dungeon or executed by Fukushu. It was why Ikuro insisted on accompanying her. Instead, Tatsu and Shizen treated the vixen like an honored guest. The celestial kitsune wished to negotiate a peace agreement, offering a fair trade arrangement for Odayakanas people. It made the vixens head spin, it almost seemed to good to be true. It was how she now found herself within the private archery range of the royal family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice shooting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Odayakana turned, surprised to see an young elf girl watching her intently. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she replied, studying the girl carefully. &quot;I had no idea elves resided in the capital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother and I are the only two,&quot; the girl replied. &quot;My name&#39;s Stella.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Odayakana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella grinned, the young elf brushing her red and black hair behind her ears as she stared at the target Odayakana was shooting at. &quot;Mother and father sometimes teach me how to use a bow and arrow. Father states I should be prepared to defend myself, even if mother is worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father,&quot; Odayakana asked, still puzzled by this elf girl. &quot;Forgive my ignorance but, who is your father? Or your mother for that matter? To my knowledge, elves almost never leave their realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stella?&quot;<br />
<br />
Odayakana turned, her breath catching in throat as the fearsome nine tail Fukushu approached. Judging by the kitsune&#39;s expression, he seemed to be annoyed that Stella was talking to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stella your mother has been searching for you,&quot; Fukushu stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry father,&quot; Stella replied. &quot;I wanted to practice archery. Mother said I could. I didn&#39;t know she was looking for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu is your father?&quot; Odayakana gasped. The elf and kitsune glancing at the astonished vixen.<br />
<br />
&quot;The range is currently in use,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;Your mother has just finished making you lunch. Please go to the dining room. You may practice afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Stella sighed before turning to Odayakana. &quot;Nice to meet you Lady Odayakana.&quot; Odayakana gave the smiling elf girl a small wave as she skipped away, leaving the vixen alone with the legendary nine tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had no idea you had children.&quot; Odayakana whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Few do,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;I have made it a priority to keep my son and daughter&#39;s existence as quiet as possible. Far too many would try to harm me and my beloved wife by getting to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Abolith,&quot; Odayakana asked, to which Fukushu nodded. &quot;I had heard rumors that the two of you were together but, I had doubts. Our people rarely intermarry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are quite right Lady Odayakana,&quot; Fukushu said, the nine tail approaching before staring down the range. &quot;Impressive grouping,&quot; he said. &quot;You are quite skilled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandfather was insistent that I learn how to defend myself,&quot; Odayakana said. &quot;It is a northern trait. We encourage our young to train in order to protect our lands. Honestly, it has quickly become a favorite past time of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, motioning for Odayakana to continue. Watching the vixen draw back, the nine tailed watch her loose the arrow once more striking near the bullseye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite impressive,&quot; he stated.<br />
<br />
Odayakana now thanked Fukushu, turning to gaze up at the imposing nine tailed kitsune. Standing at average height, the vixen found Fukushu to tower over her by at least a foot and a half. Adorned in his signature black and red hikama, Odayakana locked eyes with the kitsune&#39;s steely gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may speak freely general.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By all means,&quot; Fukushu replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;General,&quot; Odayakana began. &quot;Your exploits are the tales of legend. In the north we studied your battles. Your flawless tactics, your brutal efficiency. I remember the boys often growing excited when our teachers spoke of your actions during the Kumiho War. I though, wished to speak to you of another battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused, curious as to what this northern kitsune vixen wished to learn. Throughout his over 800 years of life, the kitsune had fought in many battles. The Kumiho, kitsune rebels, human invaders. What could interest Odayakana?<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it you wish to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Boxer Rebellion.&quot; Odayakana stated.<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, surprised by Odayakana&#39;s question. The Boxer Rebellion had taken place at the turn of the 20th century. By that time, the majority of the kitsune had departed Japan, settling in their own realm. Fukushu was one of the few kitsune to travel to the mortal realm. During those times, he would assume human form, integrating with human society and amassing a fortune as he invested in business. At that time, Japan went to war with China. Human history noted that the Qing Dynasty went to war with outsiders. What it did not tell though was the genocide of the Huli Jing.<br />
<br />
The Huli Jing were a cousin of the kitsune residing in China. When the kitsune abandoned the mortal realm, it left other supernatural races open to attack, namely the Huli Jing. Upon hearing this Fukushu and a small number of kitsune soldiers began to defend the Huli Jing, saving as many as they could. Casualties were high, but in the end Fukushu was able to save a portion of the Huli Jing population.<br />
<br />
&quot;An interesting question,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;It is a small excursion. One few kitsune inquire about. Tell me Odayakana, why would a northern kitsune be interested in a rescue mission of our Chinese cousins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My...my father was there,&quot; Odayakana stammered, her voice little more than a whisper. &quot;He...he died during the Rebellion. I was hoping you could tell me how?&#39;<br />
<br />
Fukushu&#39;s eyes went wide, flashes of memory running through his mind. &quot;Nabuo,&quot; he said softly. &quot;You&#39;re Nabuo&#39;s daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Odayakana nodded, her gaze now fixed on the imposing kitsune general. &quot;You remember him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Fukushu replied softly. &quot;It is quite rare for northern kitsune to fight with us. When Nabuo volunteered for the excursion I was surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Odayakana now listened carefully, Fukushu having her full attention. She was so young at the time, only remembering her father departing the north. When she asked why, he stated that it was his duty to protect the Huli Jing.<br />
<br />
&quot;They may not by kitsune, but they are family,&quot; she remembered her father saying. &quot;And the north always protects family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father fought well,&quot; Fukushu said, drawing Odayakana from her thoughts. &quot;He surprised me honestly. I had never seen the northern kitsune fight. He was a formidable five tail, saving many Huli Jing. I talked with him briefly yet I regrettably did not get to know him on a personal level. He fell under the command of my lieutenants Akira and his sister Aiko, acting as a scout.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t know what happened to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That much I am aware of,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;For it occurred as we were evacuating the last of the refugees.&quot;<br />
<br />
Odayakana now listened as Fukushu recalled the kitsunes last actions within China. American, Japanese, and Chinese forces were closing on their positions, Fukushu ordering a full retreat. The Huli Jing population had already been decimated despite Fukushu&#39;s best efforts, they were now evacuating the last of the camps yet needed more time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nabuo and a few others volunteered to hold the line,&quot; Fukushu continued. &quot;A small squad of four kitsune holding back an advancing army of hundreds. As the last of the Huli Jing entered the portal, I saw the squad fall. Your father was the last but his actions allowed us to save hundreds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Odayakana nodded, Fukushu watching as the vixen wiped away a stray tear. &quot;I barely remember him now,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;Flashes mostly. A warm smile, a booming voice, the tight, loving hugs he would give me before putting me to bed. All I was told was that he died defending those in need. I&#39;ve tried to live up to those ideals as I&#39;ve grown. To lead and care for those in need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re father would be proud of what you have done Lady Odayakana.&quot; Fukushu replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you General.&quot; Odayakana replied with a bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you Lady Odayakana,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;It has been a pleasure to meet you. I can only hope that with the war ending, our people can finally work together to usher in a new era.&quot;</p>
