<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Biology Homework – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
The padlock on the locker door was smashed with a hammer and the door was left unlocked and emptied out. <br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Peter said out loud. “Someone stole my backpack!” He was suddenly overcome with anger and disgust. Why would someone steal his backpack? He didn’t carry any money with him, and he just had old, used school books. It was just a pain to have to buy a new backpack and to replace the books. But that didn’t bother him. The fact that someone deliberately broke in to his locker in order to steal his backpack irritated him. He slammed his fist against the locker door out of anger, and for a moment, he had resigned himself to the fact that he had lost his backpack. <br />
<br />
But Peter Karlowski is no ordinary high school student. Most tough guys, thugs, and bullies have witnessed the displays of transformation powers that he and his cousin Tyler possess. An added bonus is their psychic abilities, and Peter decided to put his powers to use to get his backpack back!<br />
<br />
He wished for his backpack to return to him and to drag the person who stole it along with it to appear before him! His power kicked in. The black backpack was being carried by Chuck, a freshman. He was 5’4” tall, black curly hair, always in need of money for some reason. He had a secret habit, which he needed to finance by stealing schoolbooks: He used drugs. <br />
<br />
Chuck was walking down the hallway, with his own blue backpack and another backpack in his hand… a black one. Suddenly, the black backpack came to life, and started flying off on its own. Chuck felt the backpack trying to pull away from him, but when he tried to let go of the strap, he couldn’t! His fingers were glued to the strap!<br />
<br />
The backpack flew down the hall and turned a corner, heading for the stairway, with Chuck being pulled along with it, screaming as loud as he could! The backpack continued to pull Chuck down the stairs, forcing the poor kid to fall down, tumble over the stairs while being pulled by a runaway backpack! All the students who were walking there stopped and turned around, and they decided to follow the strange backpack in order to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
Poor Chuck was exhausted. Where was the backpack taking him? He turned one more corner, and he realized that he was being pulled towards the area in the hallway where the lockers were. Suddenly the backpack stopped and rested on the floor. Chuck was exhausted, he let out a deep breath, when he looked up and noticed that the backpack was at the feet of a very angry teenager named Peter Karlowski.<br />
<br />
“You!” Peter said calmly, but in a very serious tone of voice. “You stole my backpack out of my locker!” Chuck looked up at Peter and gasped in amazement. How did he know that he was the one who stole the backpack? But Chuck didn’t realize who Peter was… until now! And Chuck didn’t know about Peter’s powers either…<br />
<br />
Chuck slowly got up but he wasn’t sure what to say. He was caught red-handed and there was a very angry looking Peter staring at him. Chuck braced himself, fearing that Peter was going to start a fight with him, when he suddenly felt an invisible force grab him and hurl him against the wall of the school hallway. Then he felt something lifting him off the ground, and he was suspended, hanging from the wall and about 6 inches off the ground! He couldn’t move! To make matters even worse, Peter was slowly walking towards him, causing him to tremble with fear!<br />
<br />
Peter stared at him with his cold blue eyes, pointing his finger at Chuck as he slowly approached the helpless freshman who found himself being magically left hanging from the wall. “What’s the deal with you stealing my backpack?” Peter asked him calmly. Peter was unaware that a large crowd was forming behind him, as all the students who saw Chuck being pulled across the hallway came over and wondered what the commotion was about.<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Chuck said out loud. Peter became very angry when he said that. “You LIAR! You had my backpack in your hand! I want you to tell me why you stole my backpack. Tell me that NOW!” Peter commanded him in a loud voice! “I stole your backpack because I needed the money!” Chuck cried out loud, admitting his guilt. He couldn’t stop himself from saying it, he felt as if he was forced to confess! <br />
<br />
“What do you need that money for, Chuck?” Peter asked him calmly. Chuck bit his lip, realizing the large group of people who were silently gathering right behind Peter. He didn’t want to say what he needed the money for, but he feared that Peter was going to force it out of him anyway. “Chuck, I want you to answer my question NOW!” Peter shouted at him. Something grabbed Chuck’s mind and forced him to confess once again. “I’m using drugs, okay?” Chuck cried out loud, not believing he said that in front of a group of over one hundred students. Tears began flowing from his eyes, as he realized his days at school were now over and he had nothing more to lose.<br />
<br />
“Peter, if I had known it was your backpack in your locker, I would have never have stolen it and I would have stolen somebody else’s backpack, okay?” Chuck said out of desperation. He was getting really uncomfortable, still hanging on the wall with his feet dangling six inches off the ground, preventing him from running away.<br />
<br />
“What!? You’re a thief!” Peter shouted back at him. It didn’t help at all, Peter was angrier than ever, and Chuck felt something weird happening to him. The hallway seemed to be getting bigger and Peter appeared to be growing taller, when Chuck realized that they were the same, he was shrinking! “I should shrink you down to pint sized just for admitting that you’re nothing but a thief!” Peter said, and boy was he was furious!<br />
<br />
The 5’4” tall freshman suddenly found himself being 3 feet tall, to the amazement of all the onlookers, as Peter was asking him what was wrong with him. “You know Chuck; I would turn you into a mouse right now, just for admitting you’re a lousy thief who breaks into lockers to steal backpacks and schoolbooks just to sell them in order to raise enough money to support your drug addiction! That’s awful!” Peter shouted at him, looking down at the tiny student. Chuck realized how stupid he sounded and just broke down in tears. “I’m sorry, Peter! I’m so sorry… Please let me go now. Please, I beg you!” he cried, as tears were coming down his face. <br />
<br />
Peter realized what kind of situation Chuck was in and he began to feel sorry for him. Peter then let go of Chuck, magically setting him down on the floor. The small student walked up to him and looked him in the eye. Peter realized he couldn’t leave Chuck this way, and he wished for Chuck to grow back to his normal size again. Chuck slowly became taller and taller, as his clothes began to fit him again. Then he reached his normal height and his growth stopped. Peter turned around and saw the crowd standing behind him. “Okay you guys, show’s over. Get back to class!” he said calmly. <br />
<br />
Peter walked up to Chuck and placed his arm over his shoulder. “Look Chuck, I’m sorry for coming down on you so hard, okay? You just can’t be going around stealing backpacks in school! And you need to kick this drug habit, it’s killing you!”<br />
<br />
“I heard stories about you, Peter. You have this magic power… All the guys in school are scared to death of you. I would never have stolen your backpack on purpose, I swear! I just don’t have any friends… nobody seems to care…” Chuck said with teary eyes, as Peter and Chuck walked out of the school building onto the softball field. “Hey Chuck, I can’t solve your problems for you, but I promise you I’ll be your friend, okay?” Peter said, placing both his hands on Chuck’s shoulders, looking him straight in the eye. Peter was almost a foot taller than Chuck, but he still wanted to be his friend.<br />
<br />
Just at that moment, another student walked out of the building and followed Peter and Chuck. “Hey, guys, excuse me! Peter!” he shouted. Chuck and Peter turned around. It was Brian, one of their classmates. Peter knew that Brian was in his class, but he had never spoken to him before. Brian was about 6 feet tall, brown hair, blue eyes. He was also wearing jeans and a button shirt, just like Chuck and Peter. Brian ran up to them and stood in front of Peter.<br />
<br />
“Peter, I just saw what happened in the hallway. I know that you are able to shrink and grow people, and I want to ask you for a big favor?” Brian asked him. Peter just grinned when he turned towards Chuck. “Chuck got to shrink and grow some today!” Peter said. Both Chuck and Peter laughed about it now. “Yeah but I was really scared when you made me shrink, because I had no idea what was happening to me!” Chuck responded.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, I need to write something about the human body for biology class. Could you shrink me till I’m so small that I can go inside of your body and explore it?” Brian asked him. “Wow! You must be kidding, right?” Chuck said out loud. “No, I’m serious. I want Peter to shrink me!” Brian answered. “I want to do this for Biology class. I have to write a paper about it afterwards. But I also just want to see what it feels like to be just an inch tall!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I can shrink you down. I had better shrink your clothes too, otherwise you’ll be naked! So you want to be an inch tall, huh? Like this?” Peter said. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Brian started to shrink in size. He felt his body losing height fast, going from 6 foot to 5 feet and then to 4 feet. His clothes shrunk too, so he wasn’t left without anything to wear. “Holy smoke! That’s amazing!” Chuck said out loud, looking over at Peter and watching Brian shrink further down to the parking lot. Peter and Chuck just watched, as Brian looked up and realized that they now appeared as giants to him, and everything around him kept on growing bigger and bigger!<br />
<br />
‘Oh man, I must be dreaming! Brian said, as he passed the 2 foot mark. “How do you do that?” Chuck said, looking at Peter with his mouth wide open. “Magic!” Peter said, as he watched Brian shrink passed a foot in length. <br />
<br />
When Brian was only an inch tall, the growth stopped! He immediately ran towards Peter’s shoes, and climbed on to his right tennis shoe. “Where did he go?” Chuck asked, having lost Brian from his sight. “He’s climbing up my jeans!” Peter said, as he noticed tiny Brian climbing up his blue jeans, heading towards his blue button shirt. Brian climbed even further, as Peter and Chuck watched their tiny classmate climb up Peter’s 6 foot tall body. <br />
<br />
“I made it!” Brian cheered, as he climbed up the shirt and finally reached Peter’s shoulder. Peter turned his head and looked at the tiny figure walking on his shoulder. “You had better hold on so that you don’t fall off my shoulder!” Peter said. Then Peter held his hand up to his shoulder. “Get on my hand, and I’ll put you in my shirt pocket so you don’t get lost!” Brian jumped on Peter’s giant hand. His hand then lowered to the top opening of his shirt pocket, and Brian leaped down and landed right in his shirt pocket.<br />
<br />
“Can I stay with you for awhile, until after school is over?” Brian asked his giant classmate. “Sure, just stay in my shirt pocket for now” Peter answered him. Then Peter and Chuck attended their last period of class for that day. <br />
<br />
After class, Peter walked home, and got into his shorts when he was up in his room. Wearing just his shorts, he laid on his bed, allowing Brian to walk over his body. “I want to get inside of you!” Brian said to him. “Ok, I’ll need to help you out with a few things first, so you don’t drown while you’re inside of me, okay?” Peter said to him.<br />
<br />
Then Peter said to him “I wish for you to be able to breathe even when you’re inside my body, and for you to be able to adapt your own body so you won’t choke or drown once you’re inside. And I wish for you to be able to shrink or grow yourself from 1 inch tall to one-thousandth of an inch tall, so you can get anywhere. And I wish for you to be able to communicate with me telepathically so that you can tell me where you are and what you’re doing at all times!” Peter’s powers then took effect, and Brian was ready. “Okay Brian, you’ll start out in my heart. Have fun!” Peter said. Brian disappeared, and he found himself swimming inside Peter’s body from that moment on.</p>
