<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael sister Lisa (24) had come over to get some of the baby stuff that his wife (Megan) had taken and kept in case see had got pregnant again. But when Lisa got pregnant with her first child Megan told Lisa she had some baby clothing and stuff.<br />
<br />
What had happened is that they had asked Michael had been asked to hold Tiffany (6mo) while they went through the items. So Michael held Tiffany until they had finished and then Lisa had gotten everything in the car and then had picked up Tiffany and left.<br />
<br />
Michael had just said that the last person or thing I touched was your cousin my niece is Tiffany. Right after saying that you see that Michael seems to be shrinking and looking younger.  Jason had yelled for his mother saying that something strange was happening with dad.<br />
<br />
When Megan had gotten into the front room and was seeing what was happening. She had asked why he was wet so Jason said that he had  bought a strange liquid and I had been told it was to only cause a person to have there sink change to a color of a crayon.<br />
<br />
When they look again Michael now looks more like his sister Lisa then himself. But as they are watching Michael is regressing and also becoming more feminine. It finally seemed to of stopped when Michael looks to be about 6months old and they noticed that Michael was peeing. Megan then says that we better go and find the place where you got that stuff from  and see if they can fix you dad. Megan then picked up Michael and carried him/er into the guest room where they had set-up for when Lisa and the baby stays.<br />
<br />
Megan noticed that the shirt she was wearing was wet and smelled like urine. So she had decided to change into another shirt and then get Michael into a diaper. She then used one of Michael&#39;s t-shirt and use it as a dress on Michael. She had asked Jason if he was ready to go find the store. They had used the car-seat they had for when Lisa went with them.<br />
 <br />
They get to the mall and Jason goes to the spot where the store was before bet they see it now looks as if there wasn&#39;t a store in business for a long time but Jason spots what looks like a letter on the ground. He picks it up and finds that it is addressed to him and that when he opened it and started to read it.<br />
<br />
It was this: <br />
<br />
(Dear Jason and Megan,<br />
<br />
I knew you would come here to the store after the transformation<br />
and find that the store is gone. I had seen that Michael had been<br />
cheating on your mother but that he had also gotten some of the <br />
women he cheated with he had gotten pregnant and that his boss <br />
had told him that if he had been sexually harassing any more of <br />
the  female co-workers that he would be fired.<br />
<br />
I had changed it so that he had been on a business trip when he <br />
was killed. This way Michael gets a fresh start and that with the <br />
insurance policy that will have it so that you two will have a <br />
comfortable life also when you two return to your home things <br />
will have been adjusted.<br />
<br />
Singed The Wizard)<br />
<br />
They have returned home and when they are heading to the door<br />
 the see a package address to Jason and when they get inside <br />
Megan asked Jason to hold Michael so she can use the bathroom<br />
 and then hands Michael to Jason. It was while Megan was in the<br />
bathroom that while hold Michael that Michael throw up on Jason<br />
so the next thing Jason had was to put Michael into the playpen that<br />
was now in the living room.<br />
<br />
Jason had noticed that the puck was smelling bad so he took off his <br />
shirt and then realized that he hadn&#39;t yet opened the package. He <br />
opened up the package and sees that there are some T-shirts in there<br />
because he was now feeling a chill.<br />
<br />
He grabbed one that looked least feminine style and put it on not realizing<br />
that these shirts were magical and that it says &quot;Mom&#39;s Tap&quot; and then has <br />
what looks like two knobs that say &quot;fresh Milk&quot;. It was after Megan had <br />
finished and came back into the front room that Megan looks and noticed <br />
that Jason has put on a new shirt.<br />
<br />
Megan asked what happened and Jason said that Michael throw-up on <br />
me and that most of my shirt are in the washing so I had checked what <br />
was in the package and it was some T-shirts and I just grabbed one and <br />
put it on. Megan then noticed that the saying on the shirt and where the<br />
 knobs are looks wet.<br />
<br />
Megan tells Jason that he might want to take off the shirt because it looks <br />
wet. Jason then felt that the shirt seemed wet so he took off the shirt and <br />
they noticed that areolas were bigger and that white stuff was coming out<br />
 of them. Megan then notices a note in the box. The note says that because<br />
 it was Jason who transformed hi father and that Michael will have to grow<br />
 back up again and where Megan you had raised Jason that Jason and <br />
in the same sentence saying Jasmine will re-raise Michelle to be a better <br />
person.<br />
<br />
Jason had went to use the bathroom feeling like he had to pee but what <br />
happened is that when he got in there and undid his pants he got a surprise because  his penis had been replaced by a vagina. He let out a scream and <br />
his mother came in and asked what is wrong. He says that my penis is gone.<br />
<br />
Megan then says that if you would of read the note that until Michael now <br />
Michelle has grown up that you will now be her mother. She also says that <br />
the note also said that your name is Jasmine and that Michelle is your daughter and my granddaughter. She then says that Michelle is from a one-night stand and that the father was killed while driving drunk.</p>
