<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Anna could tell the kids wanted some &quot;alone time&quot; so she slipped upstairs once she knew she wouldn&#39;t be missed. But pointedly left Cassie&#39;s birth control pills on the kitchen counter as a silent reminder that she could have all the fun she wanted so long as she was safe. <br />
<br />
Eric and Cassie had eaten in relative silence, both trying to use the ice cream to cool themselves off. Having only been a were for twenty hours (give or take), Eric still had a lot of crazy hormones running through his system. And until now, he hadn’t realized just how powerful they were. While Anna was with them, it took every bit of his willpower not to rip his pants off. <br />
<br />
“So… should I give Ben a call? Or was there anything else you wanted to do tonight?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
When he looked at Cassie, he saw there was a bit of the vanilla dessert on her lips. But all his eyes could see was something very different. Eric shifted his position so Cassie wouldn’t see the erection he had going. But her licking her lips like that… <br />
<br />
“Eric, you alright?” Cassie asked once she saw how tense Eric seemed. <br />
<br />
“Uh, I think so. Just, you know, trying to keep a level head.” He blushed, embarrassed at his “lack” of self control. His nerves felt like they were hooked up to the world’s largest generator. Eric might not have had fur at the moment, but any and all her on his body was surely standing on end. <br />
<br />
“Oh. Eric, don’t be so self conscious. Every were knows what it’s like right after a transformation. And to be fair, we didn’t really get to finish what we started.” Cassie said, sliding her chair closer to the new werewolf. <br />
<br />
“Really? Because up until a few minutes ago, I felt pretty good.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“Ya, that’s part of being a were I guess. One second you’re fine, the next all you want to do is strip and roll on top of your partner.” Cassie’s eyes shimmered, and briefly turned this intense gold-brass color. <br />
<br />
“Glad it’s not just me.” Eric said, sensing that his own eyes were changing their color. <br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind, I’d rather take this outside. The sun’s down, and I KNOW my mom can still hear us.” Cassie looked up at the ceiling. The house’s layout positioned Anna’s room right above the kitchen and dining areas, while Cassie’s was on the far side of the house over their garage and den. <br />
<br />
Eric nodded, and the two brought their empty dishes to the sink. Then practically raced out the backdoor. Unlike the Anderson’s and Twist’s backyards, Cassie’s was pressed against the lake for which the town was named. <br />
<br />
Until now, Eric hadn’t realized just how close to Julie’s house they were. He knew that across the way, there was a trail that lead from her backyard to the water’s edge. He would have spent more time dwelling on that fact, but Cassie had already started to undress. So, for the time being, Eric pushed any thoughts of Julie from his mind and just focused on the transforming she-wolf in front of him. <br />
<br />
Eric felt a rush of endorphins flood his body as the change took hold. His skin felt like someone took a balloon and rubbed his entire body. Fur grew first, and left him looking like some sort of miniature Sasquatch. But then his body shifted, and began to assume a more lupine form. His legs and feet morphed to digitigrade paws. <br />
<br />
Behind him, Eric’s black tipped tail shook in anticipation. Triangle ears appeared at the top of his changing skull, and a long wolfy tongue hung out of one side of his muzzle. Cassie smiled, bringing him close to her. His sheath and penis were pressed against her stomach. Thick black claws extended, and then gripped Cassie’s back. <br />
<br />
“You know, I never put much stock in the whole increased libido thing. I figured it was just Nate exaggerating.” Eric said in a low voice. <br />
<br />
“Do you believe him now?” Cassie asked. Her paws petted the fur on his chest, eventually finding his nipples. Eric shuddered, and wasted no time to show Cassie his response. <br />
<br />
Gently sliding his paw into her folds, Eric howled so everyone who could hear knew that the newest werewolf of Moon Lake was very happy. As was the girl he was pleasuring. She herself had never believed much about weres enjoying sex more so than normal people. Mostly because she’d never had an experience so incredible until she’d met Eric. <br />
 <br />
Eric sensed the she-wolf was about ready, so he quickly swapped paw for his red rocket. They both howled in unison as an orgasm rocked their bodies. Eric’s knot tightened, forcing both wolves to fall to the forest floor. Eric and Cassie cuddled in each other’s arms, waiting until Eric’s swelling went down. They were more than happy to spend those few minutes licking each other’s nose. <br />
<br />
“Is it weird if I said I loved you?” Eric asked. A different kind of warmth spread into Cassie’s body. She’d never felt so elated to hear those words. She never thought she would hear them at such a young age. But before she got her hopes up, she had to clear the air about one thing. Yes Eric had already told her mother that his intentions were pure and wholehearted. But she wanted to hear it for herself, and just herself. <br />
<br />
“I’m not some rebound, am I?” <br />
<br />
“Of course not silly. Do you think I’m the kind of guy who rebounds?” Eric asked.<br />
<br />
“Highly unlikely.” Cassie replied with a smile. Eric’s knot had finally started to shrink, and he slipped out with ease. They both gave another involuntary shiver when he did. <br />
<br />
“So, you’re not opposed to me saying I love you?” Eric asked again.<br />
<br />
“As long as you don’t mind me saying it back.” Cassie kissed Eric before he could say anything else. Both were unaware of how fast their tails were wagging behind them as they fell to the forest floor to proceed with round 2.</p>
