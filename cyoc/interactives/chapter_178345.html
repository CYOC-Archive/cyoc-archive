<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas was startled by a store worker popping up from behind him. The young woman asked, “Are you considering buying that?”<br />
<br />
“I doubt it; I don’t believe in magic,” Thomas said. “But it is pretty; I could use it to freshen up my room.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” said the employee, “that rose does more than look and smell good. It’s enchanted, and I think you’d be the perfect person to use it. If you lean in and take a deep breath of it, the spell will take effect, but only for 12 hours.”<br />
<br />
Thomas was wondering how this girl actually believed what she was spouting off.  He didn&#39;t believe it and left the store.<br />
<br />
The store worked sighed, and restaged the rose on the shelf. When she turned around a short chubby woman was standing behind her.<br />
&quot;That rose sure is pretty,&quot; she told the employee.<br />
The girl smiled, &quot;i think it would be perfect for you,&quot; she told her.<br />
The woman smiled back,  &quot;my name is Rose too.&quot;<br />
&quot;a rose for a rose, sound like a perfect match.  should i wrap it up for you?&quot; she asked Rose. <br />
Rose wasn&#39;t 100% sure but something was telling her that she had to buy it.<br />
The worker rang her up and packaged it carefully.<br />
She didn&#39;t have any more shopping to do, so she went directly back to her home.<br />
She put the Rose in a vase on her kitchen counter.<br />
She sighed,  as she looked around her lonley and empty apartment.<br />
It was early on a Saturday morning and she was bored, but it was too early for lunch and she had already had breakfast.<br />
Thank god for elastic waistband She thought as she patted her stomach. <br />
She sighed as she looked down at her shapeless boobs  sitting on her chubby tummy.<br />
They weren&#39;t exactly small but in this t-shirt and bralett they blended in with her belly<br />
Time had not been as kind to her, she thought to herself.  <br />
She was pushing past her mid thirtys and pushing over 250lbs and at only 5&#39; that was alot.<br />
Her attention went back to the rose on the counter, it was so beautiful, and she swore it had almost a glow to it now.<br />
It must have been becasue it was in the sunlight now, but something was compelling her to smell it<br />
The head of the rose was a bit higher than her but she was able to reach it with her nose if she stood on her tippy toes.<br />
She took a long hard whiff, the fragrance was better than anything she had ever smelled in her life.  Food included.<br />
She felt strange,  pleasure, pain, pressure, and  dizzyness, all at the same time.<br />
She steadied herself with one hand on her kitchen counter and one on her belly, where the most pressure was.<br />
It was hard to concentrate or even see straight with all the feeling hitting her all at once.<br />
She could swear the counter felt like it was getting lower, and her tummy was &quot;sucking in&quot;<br />
While she couldn&#39;t see it happening, she was actually getting taller and thinner by the second.<br />
Her clothes were also changing, shrinking in tune with her body. The smaller she got, the tighter and smaller they got.<br />
She had stretched taller and lost at least 100lbs, she now had an hourglass figure, and was continuing to change.<br />
Her shoulder length orange--red hair changed to a deep red and grew longer and fuller till it reached just above her ass.<br />
Her ass had shrunk to 1/4 or more than it previous size and was tight and round evident in the tight exercise pants she was sporting.<br />
Her pants showed off her long shaplely legs, that had just finished growing to a 34&quot; inseam.<br />
Her waist that had stopped changing when her belly had dissappeared started changing again.<br />
Her stomach bcame flat, and her waist narrowed as her torso lenthened more.<br />
The changes seemed to continue from the bottom up. <br />
Next were her breasts that had not had any adjustments yet, they inflated and lifted higher on her chest.<br />
Her bra and t-shirt kept in tune becoming a sports bra and crop top, putting her new  little waist and perky tits on display.<br />
The change moved on to her arms the flab tightened and they becme perfectly toned.<br />
Then to her neck, it became longer and skinnier and her double chin dissappeared.<br />
She was already pretty but her face changed slightly, her nose and ears got a tiny bit smaller her lips slightlly fully but not instagram inflated, her cheekbones lifted slightly higher and she took on a &quot;glow&quot; that no makeup could mimic.<br />
<br />
Most of the pain subsided, except for the the slight arousal, and her vision cleared.<br />
She was confused at first, the counter was lower than it was supposed to be and she was looking down at the rose.<br />
Her jaw dropped as she looked at her tiny little fingers, far from the little sausages she had moments ago.<br />
Her chest caught her eye,  she had cleavage! She squeezed them, they were so big and perky.<br />
Then she noticed there was no longer a belly shelf for them to sit on.<br />
Her hand s moved to the tight flat stomach she now had.<br />
She went to the bathroom for a better look in the mirror and gasp when she saw herself.<br />
&quot;holy shit&quot; she screamed in excitment. Not realizing how loud she was.<br />
&quot;Im young again&#39;&quot; she said this time in a lower voice.<br />
&quot;maybe it the clothing,&quot; she thought to herself<br />
She stripped down for a better look, there was no mistaking it.  it was all her.<br />
She looked even better naked, it definitly wasn&#39;t the tight clothing.<br />
Clothing?  on no she had nothing to wear.  She went to her room and looked for maybe something that would fit her.<br />
She pulled out a pair of panties, and was shocked to see how small they were.<br />
She pulled out several more , they were all XS.<br />
She went thought all her drawers and closet, everything had shrunk to her current size.  <br />
Her attention went back to the Rose, she quickly dressed and found the bag the rose came in and found a note.<br />
<br />
“I realized I never told you exactly what the spell was. It’s a glamour spell, designed to turn you into the most attractive version of yourself. Again it only lasts 12 hours, but your reality is altered to fit during that time. Take care and good luck, men won’t be able to resist you now!”<br />
12 hours?  she looked at the current time.  it was 11:30am</p>
