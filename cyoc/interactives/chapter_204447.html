<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach tried to focus on the topic Mrs. Johnson was teaching but it wasn&#39;t easy. First, he really wanted to make another wish, but he thought it wouldn&#39;t be such a good idea so soon during class. He felt that it would be better to do one during lunch next period. Second, it was hard to just not wish to be super smart and get good grades but Zach felt he didn&#39;t want to pass through life so easily. It would make his wishes more boring, so for now he decided to keep everything about himself mentally mostly the same. Finally, ...... CHASE!!!!!! Zach tried to take down notes in his notebook but he could see Chase&#39;s giant bulge in his peripheral vision, slowly forming a damp wet spot where Zach could only assume pre kept leaking. Feeling more uncomfortable, Zach glanced quickly at Chase. <br />
<br />
They made eye contact.<br />
<br />
Zach turned instantly and ducked his head until he was hovering only an inch over hit notebook. He breathed in the odor of the desk. Lemon? He guessed they must&#39;ve had recently cleaned the desks. Either way, focusing on his lack of geometry notes and the smell of his desk were way better than thinking about you-know-who.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!&quot; Zach thought trying to shake the thought of it. When he looked over at Chase, he didn&#39;t feel uncomfortable, he felt FUCKING TERRIFIED. The look on Chase&#39;s face could best be described as lovestruck, lovesick, and obsessive at the same time. Zach kept trying to lower his head further as he pondered over the right course of action. Should he just unwish his last wish? But then Chase would just bully him again. Before he could decide, the bell rung springing him out of his daze. Zach glanced up to see most of his classmates gone except for... guess who? <br />
<br />
Chase.<br />
<br />
Zach looked over at Chase to see him waiting patiently for Zach. Zach felt a bit scared but grabbed his backpack and began to race out of the classroom to only hear heavy pounding steps coming from behind him. Zach began to full on sprint hoping he would lose Chase at the cafeteria. Now that his two first periods, Gym and Math, were over it was time for lunch. But Zach could feel annoyance now beginning to overwhelm him as he could hear Chase, well, chasing him. &quot;I wish I understood why he was so obsessed with me!&quot; Zach thought absentmindedly trying to ignore the heavy thuds behind him. Instantaneously regret and the wish&#39;s effect stuck him at the same time. <br />
<br />
Zach stopped in the middle of the hallway. He could feel his heart beginning to pound as he turned to see Chase quickly speedwalking toward him. If he was trying to be inconspicuous, it wasn&#39;t working, teacher glared at Chase noting they couldn&#39;t yell at him for running in the halls while other students quickly darted or ran out of line from Chase&#39;s incoming path. Noticing that Zach had stopped, Chase slowed down until he met up with Zach.<br />
<br />
Zach looked up at Chase who was glancing down at him, surprisingly not out of breath. &quot;Uh... sorry I was running so fast,&quot; Zach began to speak, he felt his face unusually become warm which he could only guess was being caused by the strange feeling coming from his chest, &quot;I just had to use the restroom.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! That makes sense,&quot; Chase said not questioning even a single word. &quot;You know the bathrooms during lunch are super crowded. It might take you forever!&quot; The other students had mostly cleared the halls by now but any remaining students kept making quick glances at the two of them. Chase nevertheless didn&#39;t even seem to mind the looks or notice them at all. His full diverted attention was only on Zach. &quot;But I know the bathroom in the football locker room is free right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Isn&#39;t the football locker room locked?&quot; Zach questioned more out of the small interest creeping into him as he continued to converse with Chase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. But since I&#39;m the QB, coach gave me a key just for me. I&#39;m not supposed to tell anyone. But I&#39;ll make an exception for you.&quot; Chase said scratching his arm out of ease except it looked more as if he was massaging his huge bicep under his letterman jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure lead the way!&quot; Zach responded as they both began making their way toward the football locker room. Thoughts of lunch and wishes had completely vanished. The old Zach would probably be panicking over making an accidental wish, the whole &quot;like&quot; wish situation with Chase, and the fact that he had &#119995;&#119990;&#120001;&#120001;&#119890;&#120003; &#119998;&#120003; &#120001;&#119900;&#120011;&#119890; with Chase but the new Zach didn&#39;t care. Due to the wish&#39;s effects, Zach didn&#39;t have any notion to undo any of the previous two wishes, in fact he was happy that the wishes had worked out so well that two of them were now in love with each other.<br />
<br />
Zach watched Chase unlock the door as he hi the light switch on the wall showing off an impressively large and nice locker room as the lights slowly turned on one by one. Zach took it in amazed, it definitely marvelled the locker room at his old public school. Even the normal gym locker room didn&#39;t look as nice. But he quickly turned back from sightseeing to focus on the main attraction: Chase.<br />
<br />
He could see Chase&#39;s face burning red as beads of sweat formed around his forehead clearly from lust and anticipation. Zach grinned as he grabbed the sleeves of Chase&#39;s jacket. &quot;You look pretty hot.&quot; Double entendre intended. &quot;Why not cool off in the shower?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase enjoyed the idea as a bulge began to form in his jeans. Slowly, Chase took off his letterman jacket and fancy shirt before removing his designer jeans and shoes. Standing in his elastic black boxers, Zach could take better notice of the big shape being outlined in Chase&#39;s undergarments. &quot;Gonna join me?&quot; Chase asked as he lowered his boxers revealing the monster at full mast. Zach stripped so quickly he could hardly waste any time thinking on what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Soon they found themselves in a shower stall standing face to face as water poured over them. Now naked, Zach could now focus on the impressive physique of Chase. Standing at 6&#39; 6&quot;, Chase definitely towered over Zach&#39;s average 5&#39; 11&quot;, but Zach didn&#39;t mind the height, it meant more of Chase to love. Furthermore, Zach also saw his golden tanned skin which showed off his blonde hair and body hair covering his large meaty pecs, defined six-pack, bulging biceps, and thick thighs. Zach even took a glance at the large bush Chase had over his hairy tennis-sized balls and the 10-inch rock hard dick he had equipped. Zach licked his lips eager for it.<br />
<br />
Despite Chase&#39;s impressive body, Zach wasn&#39;t that bad off either. Due to his second wish from the morning, he now was a hairy handsome muscled stud. However, his height hadn&#39;t change and his muscles weren&#39;t as defined, being more lean throughout his body giving him a swimmer build look with a thick layer of hair over his entire body. In addition, his dick hadn&#39;t changed either being only 3 inches. Zach wished it was a bit longer and to not much of a surprise it grew to become an astounding 8 inches flaccid. After all, he didn&#39;t want to be bigger than Chase, he still wanted his huge authentic dick inside of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about this morning Zach,&quot; Chase said as he began to grasp Zach&#39;s muscular back before shifting his hand downward, &quot;I didn&#39;t exactly tell the full truth in class. The reason I hit you was because I got so distracted imagining myself inside of you!&quot;  Now Zach could feel Chase grasp his ass, holding his bubbly but firm cheeks. Zach&#39;s cock rose to attention as he began to prepare himself while Chase slowly inched closer.</p>
