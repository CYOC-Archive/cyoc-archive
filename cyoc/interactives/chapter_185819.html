<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia walked back to her consultation room after dropping off Debbie with the rest of the heirs. It had been an honest mistake in her eyes and if Debbie really decided to make an &#39;issue&#39; of it... She could just as easily stay part of the collection permanently. It&#39;d be a shame to lose such an asset but, her knowledge of Selicia&#39;s whereabouts could easily be turned against Selicia... As Selicia more or less waddled down the hall as opposed to her more accustomed strut, she lamented her current state. Not helping the situation was the pair of panties she was wearing digging deep with the prolonged movement...<br />
<br />
Having returned to the consultation room and leaving Lisa to stand by within the room, Selicia took account of the objects in the entirety of the room proper. There was the new acquirements currently resting on the table as well as the mother/daughter duo, the candlestick bullies plunged onto their chauvinistic teacher, and the Wikkan girl riding her broom with her new feline familiar. The Magenta form of the hardened mother toy helped keep the much larger clear form of the daughter upright. Still the pair brought a smile to her face as her second set of customers, the daughter was very satisfied and the mother did get her wish after all. There hadn&#39;t been a single man to take her daughter since she had taken their place &#39;between her legs&#39;~<br />
<br />
The other two sets of objects were from her last consultation before Abernathy had caused her to stop for the time being. The trio of groupies from the bully&#39;s entourage rode the three penetrating prongs of their former teacher. Each one was locked into their final moments and their wax lips firmly wrapped around their candelabra. In a hilarious twist, one of them had actually begged to be spared~ Selicia playfully tapped the head of that particular screaming candle as she moved along. The Wikkan girl -would- have been left alone as the client had she only kept her mouth shut. Daring to command Selicia had cost her dearly leading to her becoming a figurine of herself as a skimpy witch enjoying her broom too much. Her lips parted as the shaft ran along beneath her causing a glistening streak to slide toward the bristles. At the front of the broom shaft rode her new familiar, the catty young bitch who&#39;d led the mockery and summarily shrunken and given some feline features. This one shared her enjoyment of the shaft with her new &#39;owner&#39; positioned with her own lips parted as well. The trail left by the familiar slid back and met with the Wikkan girl&#39;s vagina in a lovely little nod to their new connection.<br />
<br />
Off in an almost forgotten corner was the realistic sex doll made from a curious reporter. Selicia recalled posing as the woman to remove her from her job just to keep her here as an example. Having been forgotten so had seemingly taken it&#39;s toll of her as Selicia didn&#39;t feel anything coming from her. With a dismissive shrug she turned her eyes to the small vial atop the mantle, that pushy woman. That particular saleswoman&#39;s co-workers had particularly enjoyed her fate. An oil that truly held the properties of which she claimed that theirs would. Certainly Selicia might be able to gain -some- benefit from her but, not enough to fix her current issues... Centered on the mantle was a golden scale featuring a former detective that played the part of showpiece in the Heirs&#39; downfall. She was kept chained, blindfolded, and prostrate against the shaft of the scale with a removable sword penetrating her nude form.<br />
<br />
The last and most important set was the roommates that made her first consultation after her return. She&#39;s particularly committed their names to memory as how special they were to her. Lily was doing an admirable job as a display for her former friends. Eliza made a beautiful stress ball with all of her sensual bits kept in full detail down to the tiny leak in her lips. Natasha still posed cheerfully jumping from her stand, her uniform shirt and bra pulled up to expose her breasts while her skirt and panties pulled at her ankle leaving her completely exposed. Naomi was a intricately patterned pair of black silk underwear hanging from Lily&#39;s wrists. Each piece bore the forms of her nipples or vaginal lips respectively in their design, the only hints she had been human. Marie made up the game, console, and controller of which Selicia enjoyed playing with their mock up lives over and over again. Lily&#39;s own vagina had been sculpted to house Marie&#39;s own console body, it&#39;s disc slot made from her lips. The controller was formed from her breasts as the nipples served in place of sticks. Lastly, Eve the plushie was in her place of honor between the budding breasts of Lily. Her body was made into a fully detailed caricature of itself and yet of all of them she remained aware. Barely as it were but, aware nonetheless, she murmured the name of the only one of her friends she&#39;d remembered, Lily.<br />
<br />
Most of her other trophies or items of interest were kept in other places about the house and wouldn&#39;t have been in any danger. There was the Christmas sisters crystal drink set, the other unfortunate victims of Abernathy; the vagina balled client, the mouthed torso, and the breasted vagina apprentice toy, the recent thief bath trio, some odd items, and clothing. This didn&#39;t include the recent items created that couldn&#39;t be moved easily at the time. Those being the ice sculpture, the stained glass window panes, and the currently missing tiered cake maid... Looking at the items on the table, Selicia felt as if there was one missing. There should&#39;ve been another intruder in the form of panties shouldn&#39;t there? That odd feeling crept onto Selicia and she pulled up her dress shirt to see underneath. Thea had been too diligent in her duties it seemed... Selicia was wearing a new pair of blue silk panties that she hadn&#39;t owned the night before. &quot;That solves that mystery...&quot;<br />
<br />
The day following:<br />
<br />
Selicia had called some workers to install the new window panes and sighed as one of the workers ogled them too openly. The same time, she&#39;d already received candidates for new hires on the house staff due to arrive in the next hour. While she waddled about in her shirt and panty attire causing the workers to avert their eyes, a young woman let herself in the front door. Marina had come back and seeing Selicia as she was brought her some shock but, the girl quickly overcame it by rushing to hug Selicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh! You&#39;re just so cute now, Mistress!~&quot; The overly cheery girl gave Selicia a tight unwelcome squeeze before backing away. &quot;But... You can&#39;t walk around like that!&quot; She eyed the workers conspiratorially before ushering Selicia to the maids&#39; quarters. Several maids wouldn&#39;t be needing their clothing anymore obviously and that had apparently occurred to Marina. The young woman searched through the leftover belongings until she cobbled together a casual outfit and handed it to Selicia. &quot;Now, you better get changed before those other people get here. Don&#39;t want them to think you&#39;re weird~&quot; With a sing-song tone, Marina stepped outside for Selicia to change, the girl was lucky Selicia had a certain fondness for her. Another person might&#39;ve found themselves as a nice new toy in her collection...<br />
<br />
The clothing Marina had picked out did Selicia&#39;s form no favors as they were quite a bit too casual. As the interviews pushed on, several had a look in their eyes that they wisely did not act on. Indeed, the clothing made Selicia not seem the Lady of the manor but, rather the daughter of... Not that she seemed overly young but, they portrayed a youthful nature when added to her stature... The next maid candidate did not share their caution...<br />
<br />
Laticia Morgan, age thirty five, was a figure fit for motherhood if any were. Her large bust and wide hips gave her maturity a strong appeal to be certain. That motherly nature had started with a simple pinch of Selicia&#39;s cheek. &quot;Oh, you must be making your mother proud~&quot; Laticia&#39;s words were laden with a heavy accent. As she sat primly across the table from Selicia in the consultation room, she seemed to take in her surroundings. &quot;Ah... Such dirty things we are surrounded by, your parents are certainly an eccentric lot are they not?&quot; Taking the mother/daughter duo in her hand she casually inspected the pairing.<br />
<br />
&quot;These... They must be expensive but, they are just what they seem to be... These have no place in such a room. They belong in bedroom where such things are discreet.&quot; With her remark completed, she confidently hooked her fingers inside the mother and pulled. With a wet pop, the two came separated for the first time since their change. The fluid spattered onto her dress turning the blue fabric dark in her lap. She tossed aside the daughter having become curious of the mother&#39;s expression. &quot;This... This is a very odd choice for such a thing... What must your parents being thinking, no?&quot; She tossed the mother aside shortly after inspection. When she looked up, she noted Selicia&#39;s frustrated expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, do not worry, I will take the job and bring some comfort to your home, yes. Such things will go to where they belong and you and I will become well acquainted,&quot; Cheerfully she stood and playfully pinched Selicia&#39;s cheek once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot; Shouted Selicia as she tapped her reserve instinctively. &quot;I will not have my home insulted or be patronized any further! You...! Oh... You will do as you said~&quot; Sadism coated her words and she grinned as Laticia found herself unable to pull her hand away.<br />
<br />
With the power dwindling and frustration mounting Selicia did her best to enact the change on the woman. It came slowly with her legs seeming to crumple as she sank to the floor. Laticia&#39;s eyes shot about in confusion as Selicia strained for the first time in ages. The hand against her cheek retreated with the arm sinking into the woman&#39;s torso. Several minutes passed as Laticia&#39;s limbs finally completed their absorption into her body when it&#39;s features softened gradually.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening to me? Is. Is this your doing?&quot; Laticia seemed dumbfounded as the changes overtook her body. She gasped as her clothing expanded enough to fall about her leftover body exposing her before Selicia. Some minor attempts to contort herself were made as she tried in vain to cover herself without arms. &quot;Look... Look away, you should not see me like this.&quot; A blush accompanied her fluster as she looked away from Selicia. It was then that her head was pulled to face Selicia again of its own accord. Her body started losing its firmness as her insides shifted into stuffing. Feeling herself losing balance and falling to the floor she made to shout in surprise but, nothing came out.<br />
<br />
Selicia watched as Laticia fell on her back unable to support herself anymore and landed with a soft puffing sound. Getting off her chair she lifted Laticia in her arms and placed her laying on her side on the chair before returning to it. The change wasn&#39;t complete but, enough for now so she stopped pouring the power in. Nestling into her Laticia body pillow that still regarded its surroundings, Selicia called for Lisa to removed the remaining clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. You will bring comfort to me and my home...&quot; Reaching over to the couch she shoved the mother back into the daughter and placed the two back in their customary position. &quot;I have to say, I feel more comfortable already~&quot; She leaned back and groped a protruding breast with her left hand and sighed.</p>
