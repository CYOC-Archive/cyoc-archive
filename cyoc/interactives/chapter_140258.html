<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An American Standardbred stood in a verdant field. The mare’s glossy, chocolate brown coat shimmered in the sunlight as she happily grazed on the carpet of grass below her hooves. To the rear of the large horse, under it’s shiny, black tail, were two small, defeated, bloodshot eyes nestled between the animal’s haunches along the tiny area of dark skin located between the mare’s black puckered anus and vulva. It had been a few days since you had transformed into the mare’s new urinary and reproductive tracts. Despite lacking the necessary associated structures you still retained your senses though you could not speak. That make things too easy. You were able to hear the land beyond without any physical ears, but it sounded so far away now, so different. Though you could see, your eyesight was rather poor in your new form. This was not much of a surprise considering that your eyes were essentially just birthmarks that just happened to closely resemble a pair of eyes. It was of little consequence since much of your view was hidden beneath the long thick hairs of the tail. You were gifted brief glimpses of your surroundings whenever the horse flicked or raised her tail, but it may as well have been another world. <br />
<br />
You had learned-when the owner of the horse eventually came to check on the animal not long after you had been assimilated-that the horse was named Cocoa. It turned out that you were on a ranch of some sort that primarily bred horses, and Cocoa, your current mistress, was one of the younger mares in stock. The owners were a young couple. The wife seemed to be the most involved with the horses, or so you guessed since she was the one you encountered the most checking on Cocoa and the other animals. She was a pretty thing. Somewhat tall, shapely, and possessing an ass that just wouldn&#39;t quit. She regularly tended to Cocoa. Obviously this particular Standardbred was the woman’s favorite as she often to her Cocoa for rides. Sadly she did not seem to know you where present any more than the horse did. During a routine inspection the woman lifted Cocoa’s tail and looked right at you only for her gaze to move elsewhere while she displayed no inkling towards your being there. As for the husband, you rarely saw him. He seemed to run the business aspect of the small holding.<br />
<br />
Today it was just you and Cocoa on this side of the field. The other mares had moved off as a group leaving the two of you behind. Part of you wondered if the other horses knew something was wrong. Perhaps they smelled something off about Cocoa, like having absorbed a man into her genitalia, and that was the reason they avoided you both. It did not really matter. Even if the other horses did pick up something, they had no way of relaying the message. You doubted that their simple brains could even comprehend the events that led up to your current plight. You existed only as an extension of the mare. At this point whatever lingering physical changes that may have still been transpiring within the creature’s body had finished. You now were more equine womb and fallopian tubes than you were man. Technically you no longer were a man considering that you were part of a female horse. It’s feminine hormones coursed through you. The lines that marked where the equine ended and you began were blurred. If only you had not toyed with that machine in the sex shop. The irony was that that same machine may be the only way to fix the mess you were in. <br />
<br />
You had found that you could still move your mouth, but this was limited. To someone watching from the outside it would only register as slight twitching of the labia, and the like. You certainly could not form words with them, and you lacked a tongue. However, this did seem to araous the horse as she would suddenly squeal, and you would begin to salivate uncontrollably as the horse&#39;s vaginal fluids would involuntarily ooze out of you. Since you now functioned as her genitalia this meant that you were also tied to her libido, you could feel her lust, it was palpable, and that filled you with dread. There was a feeling, a growing, ever insatiable longing. You had a pretty good idea as to what it was, and how could you not? You were a physical embodiment of sex as it were. Cocoa must be coming into estrus. Soon she would be in heat, and you knew what was going to happen as soon as this mare found a suitable stallion. That scared that minute part of you that was still human male almost as much as the very real possibility of spending the rest of your days as horse’s pussy. Just as alarming was the fact that the rest of you that was mare genitalia, reproductive tract, and libido only felt...anticipation. What would happen to you? What would it feel like? <br />
<br />
Your thoughts were interrupted when Cocoa abruptly lifted her tail before her anus quivered. A deep, sharp flatulent sound was heard as the horse passed gas. You cringed as thick fumes spewed from the large anus just above your eyes, the force of the fart was such that it sent visible ripples through the dark, leathery flesh that covered your form. Eventually Cocoa finished and lowered her tail. The horse began to walk and as you rock from side to side you prayed that someone, somehow would realize what had happened and save you from the perverted nightmare you now found yourself in before it was to late.</p>
