<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The JFK High School Chess Club had organized a small chess tournament after school, and several of the members had signed up to play. Allen had signed up as well, but he wanted his friend Peter to join him. Using his powers, Allen made Peter appear at the club tournament, and he made him sign up.<br />
<br />
“You’ll love it, Peter” Allen said, in order to make Peter feel more at ease about playing in his first chess tournament, “I think you’ll have fun and you’ll have another opportunity to get out and to make new friends!”<br />
<br />
Peter was often happy just staying at home by himself, but Allen wanted to get Peter to go out more and to be more involved in doing stuff after school. Peter liked to play chess, although he had never played in a tournament before. He actually beat his first two opponents, until he met a student named Jamie in the third round. Jamie was more experienced than Peter, and he made all the right moves at the right time. He easily beat Peter, even though Peter didn’t feel bad about losing to a stronger opponent. <br />
<br />
Jamie found out that Peter was in his biology class, even though Peter never talked much in class. Peter always just wanted to come to class and take notes, while trying his hardest not to draw any attention to him. Nobody knew who Peter was in his Biology class, and Peter was more than happy with the idea of keeping things that way.<br />
<br />
“I’ve seen you sitting in class, but I guess we never talked before…” Jamie said, as he wrote down the score and the time of the match.<br />
<br />
“Well, I just like to keep to myself when I’m in class. I just concentrate on taking as many notes as possible, not leaving much time to talk in class, you know what I mean?” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
Jamie liked talking to Peter since he came across to him as being very sincere and a good, serious student in school. <br />
<br />
Just at that moment Allen came up to where Jamie and Peter were sitting, in one of the meeting rooms at school.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys! Jamie, I guess I will play you next, for the championship. How did it go? Peter didn’t cheat, did he?” Allen chuckled, as he looked back at Peter.<br />
<br />
“No, not at all! As a matter of fact, he played quite well, for a newcomer!” Jamie replied.<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s get going!” Allen said, as he sat down at Peter’s seat while Peter got up and grabbed his books.<br />
<br />
“Good luck, you two! I need to go home and study for my physics exam…” Peter said, as he was about to leave the classroom.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Peter! See you tomorrow…” Allen shouted back.<br />
<br />
“Nice meeting you, Peter!” Jamie said, as Peter walked out the door.<br />
<br />
Allen set up the chess board and then they played their match, which Jamie had easily won once again.<br />
<br />
“Wow! You’re really good! You play chess like its magic!” Allen exclaimed, after he was soundly defeated by his opponent.<br />
<br />
“Experience, my friend…” Jamie chuckled, “Experience!”<br />
<br />
“Speaking of magic… I’m rather surprised that Peter let you beat him so easily!” Allen said to his chess champion, as he was carefully placing the pieces back in the box.<br />
<br />
“Why do you say that?” Jamie wondered out loud. “Could he have beaten me?”<br />
<br />
“Sure! Don’t you know who Peter is?” Allen replied. Jamie just shook his head.<br />
<br />
“You played chess against a real Wizard today. He could have used his powers to beat you. But I know how Peter thinks… He hates to draw attention to himself, so he allowed you to win. He could have read your mind and he probably knew every move you were going to make!” Allen explained, as Jamie jaw dropped wide open.<br />
<br />
“You must be joking!” was all Jamie could say out of pure disbelief.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m not! I can make Peter appear right here before us, right now!” Allen said excitedly, “Just you watch!”<br />
<br />
“Peter! I want you to appear right here before us in the classroom!” Allen shouted out loud.<br />
<br />
“Instantly, Peter appeared besides Allen and Jamie in an instant, wearing a basketball jersey, shorts, and high tops. He had an orange basketball in his hands.<br />
<br />
Jamie just gasped as he saw the basketball player appear out of nowhere!<br />
<br />
“Hey, dude! Why do you need me here? I was on my way to the basketball court…” Peter said.<br />
<br />
“Holy cow! How did you do that?” Jamie wondered, with his eyes wide of amazement.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, you need to convince Jamie who you really are!” Allen ordered. “How about we make him grow a little?”<br />
<br />
“Alright! Stand up, Jamie!” Peter ordered. Suddenly an invisible force took over Jamie’s body, making him get up from the chair and to stand right in front of Peter, facing the basketball player as he used his powers on him. Jamie was about 6’1” tall and was just a few inches shorter than Peter.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Jamie. You will grow inches taller right now!” Peter commanded. Immediately the Chess Champion felt a tingling in the legs as he grew six inches taller, making him feel a little dizzy at first, as he continued to look straight in front of him. Peter actually appeared to be shrinking and the room became slightly smaller as the student grew past Peter until he was now 6’7” tall! He was now the tallest person in the classroom.<br />
<br />
“This is incredible! I have never felt this in my life!” Jamie exclaimed, as he looked down at his longer legs. Peter intentionally didn’t want to make any other part of his body grow; so that he could still keep the clothes he was wearing at that moment. Of course Allen just grinned, for he was used to making Peter grow all the time!<br />
<br />
“There you go! You’re half a foot taller now!” Peter said, as he reviewed his handiwork. “Do you have any other requests?”<br />
<br />
Jamie had to think about that for a moment.<br />
<br />
“You mean to say that you can change anything about me? You can transform me any way you want?” Jamie wondered.<br />
<br />
Peter just nodded as he stood there with his arms folded in front of his chest, while Allen answered his question.<br />
<br />
“He’ll change whatever you want him to. Peter can shrink or grow any part of you. He can also turn you into an animal or an object. Just tell him what you want!” Allen replied.<br />
<br />
“Interesting! So you can grow any part of me?” Jamie asked again, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
“Checkmate!” was Peter’s only reply. Jamie was going to ask Peter to change him…</p>
