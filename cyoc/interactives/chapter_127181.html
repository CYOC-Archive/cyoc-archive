<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie stared intently at the ring as she weighed her options. If she reversed everything she would become seven again while Kellie would become 43 again. They&#39;re friends would return to their old lives and Lisa would return to Miami, rarely to be seen by Katie. If nothing changed things would stay as they were but Katie would be haunted by what ifs. Slowly getting out of bed Katie now held the ring in front of her. &quot;I need to know,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Katie had not made a wish just asked a question. Surprisingly the ring glowed softly as everything <br />
from the previous world came into focus.<br />
<br />
In the previous reality Katie was a happy and innocent seven year old girl. She knew nothing of that world except she was comfortable with a loving, if not overbearing mother. Slowly though she began to see things she had not been aware of.<br />
<br />
Kellie was a closeted 43 year old lesbian. The woman struggled with this going so far as to have an affair with her boss. This affair led to Katies birth. Quickly though both parties realised how wrong it was to be together. A deal was then reached between the two, in exchange for him staying out of Katies life, Kellie would not ask for child support or reveal the affair to his wife. Kellie believed it was the right thing to do yet struggled with her own sexuality. She had tried to come out once, however, her parents disowned her for her sexuality. Following Kellies unplanned pregnancy Katie realized why she never saw her grandparents. They were ashamed of their oldest daughter.<br />
<br />
Katie&#39;s eyes were damp with tears as she saw just how much her mother struggled. The woman was alone in the world. Despised by her parents, taken advantage of by Katies father and unable to cope with her own sexuality. Still the ring revealed more.<br />
<br />
Katies aunt Lisa had always seemed liked the cool aunt to her. She was a bright, vibrant woman. Someone who was the life of the party, surrounded by friends and always having a smile. She was constantly doted on by her over protective sister who, despite being disowned by their parents, continued to look out for her. Their parents never sharing with Lisa what they saw as their private shame, having a lesbian daughter. A deeper look though saw the other side of Lisa&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
Lisa was lonely and miserable. The woman put out a convincing outward appearance but she was incredibly lonely. The only men she found were sleazy men interested in only Lisa&#39;s body. As she crept closer to 40 Lisa was becoming more despondent. She was getting older and despite Kellie&#39;s constant support she saw herself as nothing but a whore. Her deepest desire was to have what Kellie had, a loving child and a stable, boring life.<br />
<br />
Still secrets flooded Katies mind as she saw more secrets of those affected by the ring. Lives Katie had unimtentionally had changed for the better.<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia in the other reality never acted on their feelings for one another. While Claudia went on to a happy marriage Mika wallowed in despair. Mika&#39;s husband was a philanderer who had cheated on the woman since almost the first day of their marriage. As a result Mika now avoided Claudia except for the get togethers every year. Claudia, who also secretly had feelings for Mika, was greatly upset by this.  While the two were attracted to men they saw eachother almost like soulmates. For them it seemed a part of their soul was slowly shriveling away.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Samantha also were in better positions than they once were. For Mary Elise she had to except the fact of a lost child and a ruined marriage. The woman, while outwardly happy, covered the secret pain of her failed marriage. Mary Elise also experienced a pain no parent should go through, having to bury their child.<br />
<br />
Samantha too held regrets from her former life. While Samantha was happily married she secretly wished for more. She had married so young that she had never realized her own dreams. As she got older she began to reflect on her decisions. She wondered what could have been if she had followed her dreams instead of falling into the role of dutiful wife and mother. These thoughts were slowly making her into a bitter woman.<br />
<br />
More lives from the previous reality flooded into Katies mind. Lee and Maggie and their unimaginable sadness of having no children. Jason&#39;s abusive home under the auspices of his drunken mother Gloria. Katie could see the lives of everyone she had changed throughout her time with the ring. In every instance things were better than they were previously. Lonliness and despair was replaced by love and hope.<br />
<br />
Katie dropped the ring as tears fell from her eyes. She had not realized how much pain everyone was in previously. Her mindset as a child of seven never gave her the perspective she had now. She may have been happy but far more people she knew were in pain. Picking the ring up from the floor she realized what she needed to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish this was the original reality and that my old reality had been a wish with the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
A ripple seemed to spread throughout Katies room as reality altered. Katies reality, the one where she was seven, was nothing more than a bad wish. One the girls had changed together. Katie remembered it now like a bad dream that would linger for years. As a mother Kellie was the best. As a girlfriend now Katie had given her mother (and everyone else she had changed) an opportunity none of them had previously. A chance for happiness and to be themselves.<br />
<br />
Looking out her window Katie could see Kellie sleeping peacefully in her room. Ironically as she gazed at her she noticed Lee and Maggie peak in and smile, overjoyed by the fact Kellie was theirs. Katie smiled, the other reality a fuzzy thought in her head. &quot;I love you Kellie,&quot; she said as she placed her hamd on her window.<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she returned to her bed. She understood now what the ring had done. It didn&#39;t just alter ages, it altered lives for the better. Katie, and to some extent Kellie, brought happiness, hope and love to those they changed. While life was never easy she was a light of hope in the world. Satisfied she had made the right decision Katie crawled under the covers, content in knowing that this new reality was best for everyone</p>
