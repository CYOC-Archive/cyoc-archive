<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh thank god you are here!  Please help me&quot; said Josephine, as she approached Brendon on the stairs.  Brendon backed up rapidly, with a look of fear on his face.  He started to turn around and run up the stairs, when Josephine said softly, &quot;Please don&#39;t go.  What&#39;s the matter?&quot;  Brendon turned to face her again. &quot;You&#39;re a monster,&quot; said Brendon with disgust.  Josephine continued to slowly move toward Brendon on the stairs.  She covered her face with her hands and pretended to weep softly.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t always, &quot; she said sadly. &quot; I was just a normal girl until some crazy guy kidnapped me and brought me here.  He gave me some weird chemical, and I turned into this!&quot;  As she said this, she dropped her hands to her sides and exposed her nude body to Brendon as she completed her walk to the stairs.  She stood beside the stairs, but her new height brought her about chest level to Brendon standing midway on the stairs.  At this distance, he could clearly see some of her more feminine features.  Josephine recognized the new look of lust in his eyes, and used it to her advantage.  She gently grabbed his hand and placed it on her ample chest just above her heart.  &quot;Does this feel like the heart of a monster?  No, this is the heart of a frightened girl, trapped in the body of a monster.  Please you are my only hope for returning to normal.  I&#39;ll do anything you want if you just help me, &quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Brendon now carefully examined her nude body from head to toe.  Josephine knew her ruse was working, and continued to play the part of the bashful girl. She dropped her hands and tried to cover her breasts and exposed genitalia.  She blushed and said; &quot;Oh, I forgot that I grew out of my clothes, and now I have nothing to wear.  Can you help find something to cover up with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendon slowly descended the stairs and began looking around the lab.  Josephine smiled.  It worked, she thought, I played him like a harp.  Brendon found a small tarp and handed it to her.  She wrapped it around her waist and chest.  &quot;Thank you so much.  I was afraid no one would ever believe me, and I would be trapped here forever with that awful man.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nawww.  My stepdad is an ass, and he is into some pretty weird shit&quot; said Brendon.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t put anything past him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your stepdad?&quot; said Josephine, feigning fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m nothing like him.  I hate him.  I&#39;ll help you get back to normal.  But I&#39;m not a scientist or nothing.  I don&#39;t know what to do.  I can let you out of here and maybe we can find someone else to help,&quot; said Brendon.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; said Josephine.  &quot;I can&#39;t let anybody see me like this.  I doubt there are other people as kind and understanding as you.  Besides, I heard the man say that the antidote is in that cabinet.  But its locked and I can&#39;t open it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s no problem, I&#39;ve got his keys, &quot;said Brendon, flashing Rick&#39;s spare keys he had stolen from the kitchen drawer. Brendon opened the cabinet and looked inside.  There were several pink vials, along with a few blue vials.  In the very back of the cabinet he thought he saw some more vials of different colors, but it was difficult to see so far behind the other vials.  &quot;Which one is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The pink one, &quot; she said, trying to control her excitement. Her heart began to race - she was so close to the power she desired so dearly.<br />
&quot;Please can you open the vial for me, and pour it down my  throat.  Its difficult for me to manipulate small things with these large claws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, &quot; said Brendon as he grabbed a pink vial and walked toward Josephina. &quot;Are you sure we need just one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said eagerly, &quot;Just one for now.  If it doesn&#39;t work we can try another dose&quot;.  She could hardly contain her excitement, and her tail began to whip back and forth wildly.  Brendon looked a little concerned and slowed his pace.  Josephine blushed again and said, &quot;Sorry, its just so hard to control this body.  Please hurry, I don&#39;t want to be like this anymore.&quot; Josephine bent over and presented her large open mouth before Brendon.  She heard the sound a cork popping, and her excitement almost became bearable.  It took all her willpower to prevent her from grabbing the vial from Brendon and swallowing it whole, vial and potion.  Then she felt the sweet potion trickle down her throat.  After finishing the contents of the vial, Josephine stood up to her full height an smiled. &quot;Thank you Brendon, &quot; she said. &quot;You have no idea what you&#39;ve done for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine felt a warm burn in her belly.  It was an immensely  pleasurable feeling, a feeling of incredible energy building up.  &quot;Is it working? &quot;asked Brendon.  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; replied Josephine, followed a long laugh that was difficult to rein in. &quot;Its working.&quot;  The warmth slowly began to spread outward, extending down to her clawed fingers and toes, exciting every nerve in her body along the way. She began to become incredibly aroused. She was unconscious for most of the previous transformation, but she had not forgotten the more exciting parts.  When the warmth reached her head, she began to feel the first stirrings of growth.  Slowly her arms and legs began to stretch.  Her thighs began to gain muscle, stretching even thicker.  Curiously, her claws began to get longer, tougher and sharper.  The spines on her back also lengthened, and appeared to grow thicker.  Small growths - the beginnings of new spines - began to appear on other parts of her body. Josephine was too wrapped up in the process to notice, but Brendon was starting to get worried. &quot;Are you okay? I think something is wrong.  It looks like you are getting worse&quot;, said Brendon.  Josephine was too preoccupied to answer, not that she cared what he thought anymore.  She had won, and it felt soooo good. When Josephine&#39;s growth destroyed the small tarp covering her body, Brendon finally decided he might need to do something.</p>
