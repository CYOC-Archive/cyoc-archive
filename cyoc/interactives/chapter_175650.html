<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I... I want to be successful. I want me and Max to be successful and do what we love doing and be even more rich than we already are. And I want everything to have worked out in the best way possible. That’s it. That’s my desire.” Emily finishes, she almost looks out of breath from letting all of that out. The sundial looks like it’s processing what she asked. It’s blue aura lit up brightly, yet not too noticeably.<br />
“Is this exactly what you want?” The sundial asks in its whispering voice, it sounds more like a rhetorical question, like there is an answer it is waiting for,<br />
“Well...” Emily says, trying to think of what else she could want, “what else is there for me to want. That’s all I want to happen,”<br />
“Yes. I understand. And that is exactly what you will get. What I ask is... minor details. You see, anything is possible and I only want my encounters to serve with maximum satisfactory,”<br />
“Wait. You mean... like anything I can have, just tiny things.” Emily asks,<br />
“Yes. Anything you desire, this is yours after all,”<br />
“Well... there’s not a lot that I really want. I mean,” Emily thinks back to her childhood, her teenage years, what she dreamed would happen but never did, “I suppose I could... ask for... the tiniest bit bigger breasts, not like huge but just... is that stupid?”<br />
“Not at all. You won’t be surprised when I tell you it’s not the first time I’ve been asked,” the sundial whispered with a lighthearted tone, “now, Emily, is this absolutely everything you desire?” It asked again, in a more serious tone.<br />
“Y-yes. Yes. It is,” Emily said confidently.<br />
<br />
The sundials blue hue faded, becoming nothing more than what looked like a normal and regular looking Sundial. Emily looked at it, stared at it. She wondered if that really did happen.<br />
She looked around, quite dazed by it all. She opened the back door and stepped inside the house. She looked to her right, on the kitchen counter of the dull home she was staying in, she picked up her phone, still on charge, in the top it said ‘22%’, she exhaled through her nose in a ‘typical,’ way. She looked at the time, it was only 3:58. It had been 16 minutes since she last checked it. It felt like 4 months out there. She only realised that she had picked up Max’s phone when she saw his wallpaper. It was a photo of both of them on vacation. They had gone to Egypt a year before, it was a really fun time. They got to enjoy themselves without any stress or pressure of deadlines or anything. It was just, the best experience. She smiled as she put the phone down as to not waste its battery. She made her way to the bedroom, through the living room and into the the hallways that went to the front door, on the left of that hallway was the door to the bedroom. She opened it carefully, Max was still asleep. He was a heavy sleeper but always seemed to be up when he was needed, and always on time. She looked at him as she carefully closed the door. She looked down at herself, realising that she was still in the black silk dress. She walked over to the drawers and grabbed herself some pyjamas. She slipped out of the tight dress, and went to put the pyjamas on. She caught herself in the mirror. She looked at herself, she was only wearing her Bra and underwear. She was proud of her body. Her dark skin, dark brown hair. She made sure to watch what she ate and do exercise regularly to keep her body in shape. She looked at her breasts. They weren’t big by any means, but if someone was looking for them, they’d be able to find them. Even if she could make them bigger, she would still only make them them an extra cup size at most. Their shape, their size, their... their everything, it was perfect. She took a quick glance at her butt. It wasn’t too big, it wasn’t too small, it was cute, exactly how she liked it. She even gave herself a little pinch, not too firm, not too soft. Her body was just everything she loved. Maybe we regretted asking for bigger breasts, but what does it matter.<br />
She put her pyjamas on and layer herself in bed. As she pulled the covers over herself, she looked at Max. His red beard and hair, she just had the urge to pet him like a dog, but she refrained even though she knew he’d let her do that. She looked at his arms, squishy but muscular. Even though people at first glance would say he is fat, she knew better than that. He chubby; a layer of fat covered a very muscular and strong man. And even without a shirt on, she knew that behind that bubbly gut of his were some chiseled abs that were ready to beat anyone who came anywhere near the two of them. Well, that’s what Emily and Max joked about.<br />
She looked into his face. Even without his glasses he looked cute. She almost wished he would open his eyes so she could look into their pretty brown hue. As she imagined it, she found herself falling asleep. Her eyes fluttered open and closed as she drifted off into another world.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Emily snoozed her alarm clock for the third time. She really needed to change that tune because it really was annoying. She slowly opened her eyes, turning her head to the right to look at the time, she saw her phone on a fancy stand up charger. It said 10:30am. She sighed, “why the hell is my alarm set for this time, we’re...” then she stopped. She looked at her phone closer. It was... the latest model. Did Max buy...<br />
She lifted her head.<br />
She squinted her eye as she peered through the huge glass windows, showing her the palm trees growing outside them. She sat up quickly. She looked around. The Room, it was almost bigger than the whole house she was just staying at. She looked diagonally to the left, she saw a big TV with two odd but very comfortable seats in front of it. Almost everywhere her eyes went she could see some sort of plant, whether it be potted in the room or outside it. She didn’t know what to say, what to do.<br />
She looked at the TV, there a reflection. The reflection was of a door, the door was glass, it had to be a bathroom.<br />
She quickly shot out of bed, running to the bathroom. She looked around. There were two sections. One had a bath and a toilet, the other had a sink and what looked like a towel rack. She quickly went to the sink, hoping for a mirror. She didn’t find a mirror, instead she found a painting. It didn’t look particularly professional, but much better than she could produce. Then, on the wall on the left of the door she saw a bath and a full body mirror.<br />
<br />
She shot over to the mirror. She looked... so much different.<br />
For starters, she was white!?<br />
She looked at her skin, it was so much lighter. She had shorter hair, it stopped at the base of her neck. It was parted in the middle. It looked strange. The shape of her face was similar to hers, but it was just... different. She had a beauty mark on her right cheek. She looked at her body. The most noticeable thing to her. Her breasts. They were... they were so much bigger than before, and perkier. She was wearing night clothes: a lavender v-neck t-shirt and black joggers. She looked at her breasts in the slightly baggy shirt. Unlike before, her breasts always touched the fabric in some capacity, and she wasn’t wearing a bra, which she usually did whilst sleeping. Her nipples were poking the shirt, making them extra visible. They were very erect, tenting it, making it even more noticeable. Emily couldn’t help but poke it, she wasn’t overwhelmed with pleasure as she half expected, but they definitely felt different. They were perky, they stood up and out, but they were much further down her torso. Not sagging or anything, but naturally they were lower, and it made them stand out more too, they looked even bigger because of it.<br />
Surprisingly they didn’t feel dramatically heavier, they were heavier, undoubtably, but they weren’t hard to handle.<br />
She looked at the rest of her body. Her waist looked about the same, but her hips, her hips made it seem much smaller.<br />
Her hips were just wider than where her arms connected to her shoulders. She cocked them, there was a lot of movement, it was strange. Her bones were different and she felt it. Her legs were thicker by an amount. She had to admit it, she had some curve to her.<br />
She turned to face the side, looking at herself. Her breasts stuck out further than she realised, but maybe it was due to the lack of bra. Her butt was also noticeably bigger. She placed both her hands on it. It wasn’t super soft, but definitely wasn’t that firm, more soft than firm, plus the extra padding onto that.<br />
<br />
She looked at her curves on last time before noticing two things. Her face neutral right now, but she realised that her mouth had a natural smile to it, pointing up. This made her always look either happy or a little condescending. The second thing she noticed was a number of pictures, framed on the wall. <br />
The first was a photo of Emily from what looked like high school, she was standing with a number of cheerleaders, they all looked like... her old school friends. That makes sense. She looked in the photo for Max? Nope. In the top corner it had written in pen, ‘from your best friends! Congratulations!’ For what? The wedding, most likely. Emily thought to herself, confused.<br />
Next to that one was another one of her, it was much clearer. She looked at a younger version of herself now. She still had shorter hair, it looked much more trendy. She had the same beauty mark on her cheek. Her lips looked... thinner. She looked at herself in the mirror again, then back at the photo, she looked back at herself in the mirror before poking her lips... had she had lip fillers? They weren’t huge or noticeable, which seemed to be a trend with her, but they were definitely not as thin as in the photo. The photo was a yearbook photo, it looked to be a final year photo. Next to that was another yearbook photo, this time it wasn’t her. It was a man. Looking closer... it was Max.<br />
He looked different. His hair was dark brown instead of red as it was before. He had stubble, but it looked more cleaned up. Was this really Max?<br />
She looked at the next photo. It looked like... Egypt! She looked closer, she was with Max. He had a full beard now, but it wasn’t as fluffy or cute, it was much more tidied up, even his hair was tidier. She looked at herself. She was wearing a cropped tank top, something she hadn’t done since she was a teenager. But looking closer, she saw her belly, it was a little bloated looking. <br />
She looked down at herself, lifting up her shirt, she looked at her stomach. It wasn’t entirely flat, but wasn’t bloated... maybe she was looking at the photo wrong. She looked at the next picture. She wasn’t in this one. It was Max attending what looked like a very fancy event... a party? A wedding? It wasn’t clear, but just from how they looked, the people in the background of the photo were definitely either celebrities or millionaires.<br />
She got to the next row of photos, she was in these ones. The first one was another vacation, she skipped past it. The next was... it was Emily, she was wearing a tank top, it was showing a tiny bit of her midriff. Her black bra was peaking over the edge at the top, her breast were clearly outlined. She hated showing off her body like that. She completely disregarded the situation the picture was set in, as she noticed who’s hand she was holding.<br />
<br />
“Mom! Have you seen my ring!?” A voice yelled from downstairs. It was a girls voice.<br />
<br />
Emily quickly skimmed past most of the photos, seeing the same girl over and over and over again. She got to the last photo. It was a family portrait, Max on the left, Emily I the middle... and the girl on the right.<br />
<br />
She had a daughter.</p>
