<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not long after Jennifer wet her panties she felt a pressure in her butt but due to her regressed state she no longer knew she had to poop and continued about trying to get up stairs and after about 10 minutes she felt the warm mush spread across her bottom.  She then plopped on her butt and began to scream and cry. There was then a knock on the door and noises of a key in the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jen dear what are you doing home?&quot; Jen's mom noticed the tears in her eyes and the stain on the floor.  &quot;Jen, did you wet your self!&quot; next she saw the brown on the back of her skirt.  &quot;Sweetie what in God's name are you doing&quot; all Jen could do was cry, she couldn't understand her mother at all.  She pointed at the phone and screamed loudly.  &quot;Jen tell me what is happening dear please&quot; but she kept pointing at the phone.  Jen's mom knelled down to holding her.  &quot;Oh sweetie, please tell mommy something you’re scaring me!&quot; Jen huddled to her mother and cried out three words.  &quot;Trafom an da...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes were now open wide and she could help herself from the fear.  She knew what those words could do; the memories come flying back.<br />
<br />
Twenty Years Ago...<br />
<br />
Anna and her sister Millie left the house around eight that night headed for a small party down at Flit Creek.  It was the party of the century.  Everyone from school was going to be there, along with Michael Flit, the cutest boy in school.  Anna has had a crush on Mike for years.  She has never had the courage to talk to him; that’s until last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Anna, I heard you didn't have a date for tonight&quot; Mike smiled as he spoke.  &quot;I...um...I...no&quot; Anna's tongue was tied tight.  &quot;Would you like to go with me?  My dad says I can invite as many people I want, so I was hoping you'd like to come” Anna stood frozen stiff.<br />
&quot;She'd love to Mike, see-ya tonight!&quot; Millie helped her sister walk slowly.<br />
<br />
That night couldn't be greater.  Great music, great games, and a few other things...<br />
<br />
As the night grew old, and people left Michael went into the house with the kids allowed to stay out late.  &quot;Everyone here has heard of the history of this property?&quot;  Several kids shook their heads in laughter.  &quot;What do you mean Mike&quot; Anna asked wrapped in a blanket by his side.  &quot;This entire area, the lake, the creek, and the barn we are in now, were once owned by the O'Reily Sister's, which happens to be my great grandmother's maiden name.  They were witches!&quot; everyone laughed, Mike always loved the stories about the Flit Estate.  &quot;When my great grandfather married my grandma, the last living O'Reily the Estate's name was changed.&quot;  A question popped into Anna's head.  &quot;What happened to the other sisters?&quot;  Anna was hooked, she never heard of the O'Reily sisters before, and apparently she was the only one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform and Dare!&quot; the others screamed in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is said when the sisters turned 20 they were given a book.  In it contained spells even Merlin himself dare not conduct” the room was filled with laughter.  &quot;Believe or not, but I warn you, your already playing.&quot; the room became quiet.  Mike's eyes darkened as he turned to Anna.  &quot;All but you that is...&quot; &quot;Wait, what gives you the right to make us play Mike&quot; laughed Tim, Mikes youngest brother.  &quot;That’s easy; you all said the title with me did you not.&quot; Mike laughed.  &quot;So, do we have a game&quot; Mikes eyes drifted back to Anna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Anna it will be fun&quot; &quot;Yeah, lets play&quot; &quot;Anna, Anna!&quot; &quot;We want to play!&quot; all the others chanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, Transform or Dare&quot; &quot;Then it’s settled, we are all playing&quot; Millie smiled and hopped up and down.  &quot;Well you’re so chipper, you'll go first.  Transform or Dare?&quot;  Millie laughed &quot;Transform me baby!&quot; Millie was tipsy as hell.  &quot;Ok bouncy, I think a rabbit fits you, and just to make it interesting you change slowly, and your personality will as well till you finally lose humanity and no one who will remember you but us.&quot;  Everyone laughed including Millie, but as she laughed Anna noticed something.  Millie’s front teeth were getting larger; wider.<br />
<br />
Anna kept quiet because no one else seemed too noticed.  &quot;Ok Tim your turn, transform or dare&quot; Millie smiled again, and her teeth seemed all the wider.  Mike smiled, but Anna wasn't; she was worried.  &quot;I'll take dare&quot; everyone was giggling and talking among themselves, and some quiet finally noticing Millie’s large teeth.  &quot;Ok Timmy, I dare you to...&quot; Millie paused to itch her ear...<br />
<br />
&quot;Act like an infant!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked at her daughter who was playing with her hair and laughing.  &quot;Oh hun, who did this to you?&quot; Jen still laughed as she played with her mom’s hair.  Anna pick up her daughter and brought her to the kitchen laying her on the table.  Jen moved around like a baby, twisting turning with a smile.  Anna grabbed some toilet paper, a large cloth square, and a safety pin.  “This will have to do” Anna took off Jennifer’s skirt.  “Dear wear underwear!” she gave her daughter a dirty look, but Jen didn’t even notice.  As Anna wiped she noticed something.  Jennifer’s pubic hair was falling out, and her bra was loose.  “Oh no!” the spell was doing more, it was regressing Jen.<br />
<br />
“I cannot take care of a baby right now!” Anna started to cry as she pinned the diaper on.  Jen was sucking her thumb and was drifting in and out of sleep.  Anna carried Jen, who had lost some weight since the last trip, to Anna’s room and let her rest.  Even now Jennifer was looking younger.  Her teenage bust had turned into pre-teen bug bites, and her face started to redden returning to her old complexion.  All the memories of Jen as a little girl came back.  “What happened to my little Jenny?  You grew up so fast, and became a beautiful young woman” Anna laughed as she wiped her tears “well you were a young lady, that damn game has done it again!”<br />
<br />
Anna wiped her tears as a small white rabbit padded into the room.  “Oh Millie, when will people learn” she picked up her sister petting her.  “It screwed up your life and now Jen’s” she looked back at Jen and she was even younger.  Her breasts were completely gone and the diaper no longer fit.  Anna readjusted it.  “There you go Jen” Jen laid sleeping sucking her thumb.  As she looked at her daughter she remembered what happened to Tim.<br />
<br />
“Yeah like I’d do dat” Tim laughed.  Everyone was laughing up a storm that’s until Tim wet himself.  “What da ewl!” Tim shook his hand up and down.  “I don’t do dat no I’m a big boy!” Tim eyes filled with tears and he began to wale.  Everyone stopped laughing and stared at Tim.  Was he joking, or was it real?  The only noise in the room was Tim crying.  “Tim, Tim what are you doing” a boy who was sitting next to him asked.  A screamed shot throw the air.  “My ears!” everyone looked at Millie.  Her ears where now covered in fur and resembled rabbit ears.  “Now we see the power of the game let’s start playing for real” Mike’s face became grim yet happy.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t cool Mike we need to… to…”  Millie seemed detached all of a sudden.  Anna watched as Millie began to slowly shrink in size.  “Millie!” Anna ran to the pile of clothes where Millie once stood.  A small rabbit head popped out.  “Turn her back Mike, now!”  Anna screamed.  “Oh come Anna, magic has it back fi…” Anna’s hand slammed against Mike’s face.  “Change her back” Anna held Millie up to Mike’s face.  Mike laughed “It looks like it’s my turn again” Anna lowered Millie “What?” “If anyone is incapacitated by the game then the previous player is once again in control and since both Tim and Millie cannot talk, Anna, Transform or Dare.”<br />
<br />
Anna ran to the phone and dial *69.  “The last call came to you from area code: 123-555-0123: If you would like to call this person back press one” “Hello Kyle speaking, who’s this?” “This is Anna Smith, you did something to my daughter, and before she could pass it on she well” Anna looked at a six year old Jennifer “She’s regressing in age please help me turn her back” Kyle laughed on the other line.  “Yeah in a million years, she’s a bitch mommy, looks like you failed” Kyle just laughed and laughed.  “Please I cannot take care of a baby right now; I have a job, and late night classes I cannot deal with this please!”<br />
<br />
The laughing on the other end had ceased.  “What do you mean by helping?” Kyle asked.  “When the last person to be affected is not able to affect someone else the previous person is again in control” there was silence on the other end.  “I will help you, but on one condition, we alter Jennifer’s personality…” a long pause and then Kyle voice enter the phone “We make her the person she us to be before…before her cheerleading days” that’s when Anna remembered the voice.  “Kylie Perkins is that you, what happened to you?” It seems the game had taken even more people then Anna realized.<br />
<br />
Kylie Perkins was Jen’s best friend since pre-k, they were inseparable, that is, until high school and the connection seemed to fade.  “Who did this to you, we can change you back” Kylie laughed as Anna finished.  “How?” “Do it to me, like I said you’re in control again!” “So how does this help Jen?” Anna looked over to an even younger little girl.  “I have a plan but I’m not sure if it will work, but when you ask transform or dare I will say dare and you’ll dare me to have a 18 teen year old daughter instead of my current one giving us Jennifer back” it was perfect but it didn’t grantee much.  “Ok, Transform or dear” Kylie muttered.  <br />
<br />
“Dare!”</p>
