<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zoe moaned as she woke up. Her head was pounding and the light streaming in through the gap in the curtains was like a knife being driven right into her eyes. Given how much she&#39;d drunk last night after....whatever it was she&#39;d been doing, she supposed she deserved this hangover, but even so, she resented the sort of chemical karma that alcohol came with.<br />
<br />
Sitting herself up, she mumbled as her arms stayed asleep as she tried to rub her eyes. She must have been lying on them, so she&#39;d have pins and needles to contend with on top of the hangover soon enough. Wonderful. For now, rubbing her eye on her shoulder would have to suffice as she got up and made her way to the bathroom to splash some water onto her face.<br />
It was when she reached her door she realised something was wrong. It was shut, obviously, but when she tried to open it, nothing happened. Again and again in a bleary stupor she tried to reach for the door handle, but she just couldn&#39;t seem to grasp it. Something what *very* wrong here, but she just couldn&#39;t work out what in her current state. Then she caught sight of herself in the mirror on the wall.<br />
For some reason, her own face looked unfamiliar to her, like it was somehow new. But, she remembered always seeing that face in the mirror; the pouty lips, the cute nose, the (currently very messy) chestnut hair she wore  at shoulder length, all of it. Then she looked down a bit and sobered up immediately.<br />
<br />
Just below her face was her shoulders. Her bare, armless shoulders. Having slept nude, as she tended to, there was nothing to obscure the smooth, flawless skin that lay where her arms had used to be. She tried to reach out to pinch herself, but all she achieved was to uselessly wriggle her empty shoulders.<br />
<br />
&#39;The Chronivac&#39;, she realised as her memories of the previous evening. That dweeb Tyler must have done this to her using the Chronivac, just like she&#39;d....what had she done again? She knew she&#39;d done *something* but the details eluded her, lost in a haze of alcohol and panic.<br />
Still, this meant she could undo it, if she could just get to it without Tyler spotting her. She really didn&#39;t want him to see her like this. But if he did, then she could just blow him like she&#39;d always wanted to in return for the chance to get her arms back.<br />
<br />
Something about that statement didn&#39;t sound right, but she couldn&#39;t place why at the moment. Still, she had a plan. Or at least, she would if she could work out how to leave her room.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Tyler woke up with his own hangover. His head was killing him and it felt like he&#39;d slept with his mouth open. He tried to get up but realised he couldn&#39;t move. Opening his eyes and looking around, there was a huge sheet above him and two large....somethings holding him down. He tried to push against them, but was completely immobile. He tried to call out for help, but could only manage to clench his mouth a bit and even that didn&#39;t feel right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm&quot; A familiar feminine voice mumbled from somewhere nearby, &quot;Mornin&#39;, Ty&#39;. You&#39;re up early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who was that? Was there a girl in his bed? Had he scored somehow and not realised? No...He hadn&#39;t met any girls yesterday. He wasn&#39;t really the party sort and besides, thanks to the Chronivac he&#39;d have the perfect girl the next time he saw what he&#39;d turned Zach into.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the world shifted as something massive moved around him. The sheet was pulled away and the two massive somethings either side began to move, lifting him up. He tried to yell as he was hauled into the air, but was unable to make a sound while the female voice above him yawned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you had a better dream than I did, Ty&#39;. I dreamed I was back in school and everyone was being mean to us....&quot; the voice said sleepily. It was definately familiar, but Tyler couldn&#39;t place it.<br />
As he was carried, he looked around. It seemed to be his room; it had all his stuff, but it also had other things. He&#39;d never had a dresser like that, nor a makeup shelf. Was this a girl&#39;s room? And why did everything look so big?<br />
<br />
He was brought to a stop in front of the dresser, which loomed in front of him while whatever was pulling him around did something far above him.<br />
&quot;I wonder if Zoe is up yet. You want her to give us a kiss before breakfast?&quot; the giant above him asked. Zoe? Right that was the name he&#39;d given the new Zach. She knew Zach? Did this mean changing her had somehow done something with whatever girl he&#39;d brought back with him tonight?<br />
<br />
Eventually he was pulled away again and the large somethings around him moved again. Two more large shapes descended and pulled something up the huge pillars, something he recognised but couldn&#39;t make sense of at this scale.<br />
<br />
&quot;There! Not bad for first thing in the morning, eh bro?&quot; the voice said as she was turned to face a large full-body mirror he knew shouldn&#39;t be in his room.<br />
What he saw in it made no sense. There was a girl in his mirror, giving a pose to herself while wearing little more than a short nightie and only came down to her waist and a pair of thigh-high stockings. In the space between them he saw something that would have made his heart stop if he still had one. Where the nightie and stockings parted was the girl&#39;s bare crotch, adorning which, just above her hairless snatch, were a pair of eyes that blinked whenever he did. Looking up, he finally realised why he recognised the voice as he saw his sister Lizzie smiling down at him affectionately.<br />
The realisation hit him like a punch to the face; somehow he&#39;d woken up as his sister&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you look cute today?&quot; she cooed<br />
<br />
No, this wasn&#39;t real! This couldn&#39;t be happening! Lizzie wasn&#39;t supposed to be here and he definately wasn&#39;t supposed to be her sex! How was any of this even- The Chronivac! Something must have happened with the Chronivac!<br />
His eyes darted around the room until he spotted it, still sitting on the desk. On the screen was a notification &quot;Update complete - Two queued changed proccessed&quot;.<br />
Two. Someone had tampered with it while he was out, which could only mean Zach. Zach had done this to him and given that Tyler knew the meat-head had &#39;joked&#39; that he&#39;d fuck Lizzie&#39;s brains out after that one time he&#39;d met her, the reason why was all too easy to work out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, lets go wake up Zoe and get some breakfast.&quot; Lizzie said cheerfully, walking out the room and bringing her transformed brother along the for the ride as he mentally begged her to use the Chronivac, to no avail.</p>
