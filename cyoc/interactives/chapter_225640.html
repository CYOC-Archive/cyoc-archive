<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the bell rings, signaling the start of the school day, Jeff activates the scanner and pockets his phone, ‘it’ll take a while for everyone to be scanned,’ he thinks to himself as he gets to his feet and starts to head out the break room, not noticing Jake following behind.<br />
<br />
Jake has his phone out, ‘there is still an issue to deal with,’ he thinks to himself, opening Jeff’s file. The 14-year-old scrolls down until he lands on Jeff’s “attracted to” field, which he edits from, “athletic Hispanic boys, especially Rick Alverez”, to, “athletic dominant boys”.<br />
<br />
When Jeff arrives in his classroom, he notices that the teacher is not there yet, he walks over to his desk and sits down. The teen takes out the things he’ll need for the class and leans back in his seat, taking out his phone. Jeff opens the Chronivac, he checks the scanner and sees that it’s only at 10%. The teen lets out a sigh, ‘this’ll take a while,’ he thinks to himself, Jeff then gets an idea, he opens a other screen, there he programs the transformations he wants to happen, then he selects who should transform, which is: “every student in the high school, once scan is completed”, then he also activates the teleporter, and sets it so the “items” get teleported to his “girl-room” once the transformation is completed.<br />
<br />
During his class, Jeff suddenly notices some of his classmates, including some of his close friends, suddenly vanish, instead of panicking, the teen grins to himself, ‘looks like my new room is starting to fill with clothes, a bed, a desk, a wardrobe, some make-up, some jewelry and anything I need as “Jess”,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Jake himself notices something weird is going on as his own classmates and friends just vanish, ‘hm… something tells me, someone other than me has a Chronivac-App, good thing I’m immune to whatever the person’s plan is,’ he thinks to himself, but other than that, Jake simply stays calm, ‘who needs friends, when you have got an obedient girly boy at your mercy,’ he asks himself with a smirk, ‘I just hope MY Jeff will not be affected, something tells me that HE is the one behind the students and teachers vanishing’.<br />
<br />
By the time the bell for the lunch break chimes, Jeff’s classroom is empty, only his teacher, who seems to not notice anything unusual, is still around, but when Jeff walks by him, the teen notices that the teacher’s body seems to look less sharp, ‘looks like my teach is fading, I wonder what he’ll be,’ Jeff thinks with a smile.<br />
<br />
When Jeff steps out the door he hears someone say, “hello, Jeff,” and when he looks up he sees a 14-year-old athletic boy standing opposite him, his back against the window, his arms crossed and a weird, almost scary looking grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, “um… hi… do I know you,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jake, still grinning, shakes his head, “I just started going to this school,” he says, “my name is Jake Wilson”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says, sounding confused, “then how do you know my name? Do you know one of my… friends?”<br />
<br />
Jake pushes himself from the window and starts to walk towards Jeff, “no,” he says, still with that weird grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Jeff starts to feel uneasy, something about this boy feels off, the teen starts backing away, back into the now empty classroom, “then… then how do you know my name,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
Without taking his eyes off of Jeff, Jake uses his foot to close the door of the classroom, “oh… I have my ways of getting information of someone,” he says, his grin widens when he notices how uneasy Jeff seems to be, “am I making you feel uneasy?”<br />
<br />
Jeff feels himself bump into a desk, which causes him to sit on it, with Jake stopping inches away from him. The teen gulps and nods, “y-you are,” he says, “wh-what do you want from me?”<br />
<br />
Jake lies a hand on Jeff’s chest, grinning at the 16-year-old, “you,” he says, “I want YOU!”<br />
<br />
Jeff feels a cold shiver run down his spine, his whole body tenses at the younger boy’s touch, “s-sorry, Jake,” Jeff says, “I… I’m not gay! C-Can you please… step away?”<br />
<br />
Jake smirks, “I know you aren’t gay,” he says, he then leans forward, “you little cunt-boy,” he then whispers into Jeff’s ear.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen in horror, “h-how… how do you know… that,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jake grins at Jeff, “oh… I know something else about you,” he says, “I know that you have a boyfriend who is nine! You know, you could go to prison for being in a relationship with such a young kid.”<br />
<br />
If possible, Jeff’s eyes widen even more, “it… it’s not like what you think,” he blurts out.<br />
<br />
“Oh, really,” Jake asks, moving his hand down Jeff’s body, towards his crotch, “do tell,” he adds with a grin.<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a hitching gasp when he feels Jake’s hand come to rest on his flat crotch, “I… I’m not going… to tell you anything,” he manages to croak.<br />
<br />
Jake simply grins evilly, “oh, I think you will,” he says, starting to stroke Jeff through his pants.<br />
<br />
Jeff tries to ignore the pleasurable feeling, “I… I won’t,” he says, “wh-why are you... are you like this? Threatening me?”<br />
<br />
Jake smirks, “well, as you undoubtedly can tell, I am a really handsome boy,” he says, “I can see in your eyes that you find me attractive. Hehe… let me just say, that I am tired of girls fucking around with my feelings… if you get my drift… you may not be a girl… hehe… but you are the next best thing, and I will get used to it quickly! Now, tell me the truth behind your relationship with your boyfriend!”<br />
<br />
“Never,” Jeff says, “y-you can’t force me!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe… oh, I think I can,” Jake says, “I don’t think you’d like the world to know about you being a cunt-boy… or a pedophile at that!”<br />
<br />
“Y-you… you wouldn’t dare,” Jeff says in fear.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… would you really want to risk that,” Jake asks, pushing his hand under Jeff’s shirt, grinning when Jeff lets out a moan, “it only takes a small text, which I’d post online, soon the world will know. Hehe… I bet it won’t take long until the cops show up at your parents door… hehe… I wonder how you’ll explain everything to them!”<br />
<br />
Not wanting to end up in jail, Jeff decides to just tell Jake the truth, “fine… you win,” he says, ‘he should be transformed and teleported to my room by now! Why isn’t it affecting him,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“I’m listening,” Jake says, grinning at Jeff, so Jeff starts telling Jake everything, after he is finished Jake is still grinning, “hmmm… hehe… now I get it. So, Rick thinks you are an 8-year-old girl, he is unaware who you really are?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “now… w-will you please let me go,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jake shakes his head, “hehe… silly Jeff,” he says, “I told you: you are mine now! Oh, and if you think you might be able to save yourself, by using your App on me… hehe… I’m sorry to say: I’m immune to any Chronivac out there, except when I WILLINGLY allow someone to transform me!”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen as he suddenly understands, “th-that is how you know all this about me?!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe, yep,” Jake says, “I too have a Chronivac-App. So, I assume you know what I could do to you, right?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, now really terrified, “I… I surrender,” he then says, “you win! I’ll do anything you say! Just please… please d-don’t tell anyone!”<br />
<br />
Jake smiles, “good “girl”, and don’t worry: as long as you obey me and do as I say, you have nothing to fear!”<br />
<br />
Finally Jeff accepts his fate, but as he thinks about it: Jake’s dominant personality, his body, the way he touches him, everything feels amazing.<br />
<br />
Jake notices the change in Jeff’s eyes, “hehe, looks like you actually are starting to enjoy how I am treating you,” he says, “hehe… what’s the matter, Jeff? Am I to dominant for you?”<br />
<br />
“I… you…,” Jeff says, trying to come up with something to say.<br />
<br />
Jake chuckles, “I take that as a “yes” then,” he says, “mhm… I can’t wait to fuck that virgin cunt of yours, babe!”<br />
<br />
Jeff feels his body tingle from excitement and fear, “wh-what if s-someone comes,” he asks, hoping Jake would leave him alone… at least for a while.<br />
<br />
Jake smirks, “hehe… no one will come, Jeff,” he says, starting to take off Jeff’s shirt and tie, “we should be the only ones in the school,” he adds with a knowing look in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps, “h-how,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jake shrugs, “since I’m immune to the App, I guess I am always aware what happens around me, while others may not be aware,” he says, “mhm… I already like what I am seeing so far, you have a nice hairless body, and your skin is so soft. Hehe… can’t wait to see what is under those pants of yours,” with that, Jake moves his hands to Jeff’s pants to unzip and open them, he then slowly pulls them down Jeff’s legs. Jake chuckles when he sees that Jeff is wearing panties, “hehe, you are more girl than I thought,” he says, before pulling them down, revealing Jeff’s virgin pussy. The 14-year-old licks his lips, “man… that is one hot pussy,” he says, he then looks up at Jeff, grinning when he sees Jeff’s red face, “hehe… you’ll enjoy it as much as I will, babe,” he says, already starting to strip himself, “now, take off your shoes, socks, pants and panties, while I get my own clothes off”.</p>
