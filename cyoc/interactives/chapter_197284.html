<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Chris, Justin and Rick had school earlier then Mark had his classes that day, he could watch them getting ready without stress. Chris had a few problems getting a new shirt on after showering, which had the bathroom nearly flooded. His jeans were even worse to pull up with his fists, so far that Rick had helped him after a few minutes. As he had seen his friend’s problems this morning, Rick helped Chris with his socks as well. Only, as he, at least in his mind, never had worn shoes, he couldn´t help Chris with them. In the end, Chris hadn´t tied his shoes, just walking in them. They should be tight enough to hold, he guessed.<br />
Rick was the quickest to get ready. While he was in the bathroom last of the three, he only slipped on the underwear from his backpack, leaving the rest inside, wondering why he had so much clothes in there.  He never wore so much. He helped both his friends with their clothes, teasing them for their clumsiness when they dropped down again and again.<br />
Justin, after getting into the bathroom after Chris, made a similar mess as Chris, unable to handle anything with his stiff hands. Afterwards, he slowly put his clothes on, having nearly as much problems with them as Chris had. But, as he could still slightly bend his fingers, he could pull his jeans on easier, only closing his belt didn´t work out. After dropping his jeans a few times, Rick showed mercy and closed it for him, laughing at him and Chris.<br />
Soon enough, Mark escorted them to school, saying he needed to help Aidan, and their school wasn´t far from his flat. Mark had to really hold it as he watched the trio of friends move. Chris was walking on his hands and feet, ass high in the air. That resulted in his backpack slipping every few minutes against his head, as his back was bend that way. Justin walked a bit unsteady, as with his “Two-toed”, bare feet he couldn´t balance that good it seemed. Rick, walking behind them, or better, cavorted behind them. His wilder side made him do a few acts out of normal, like walking in a handstand for a few minutes, dropping into a similar stance as Chris and walking on all fours, or even trying to walk one sided on his left foot and hand.<br />
Mark took his time calming his laughter as soon as they were in their school, slowly heading over to Aidan. He could already see himself being distracted again with planning that day.<br />
<br />
Aidan took his time getting ready as well. He crawled into the bathroom, removing his worn clothes one after another. The sock-gloves were laid next to the sink, the ones from his feet laid next to them. His pants and shirt dropped into the laundry basket, followed by his pacifier sock and the bib sock after removing the cord from it. Last, he peeled off his soaked mess of a diaper to toss it into the trash. He carefully took both socks from their places in there, leaving him naked.<br />
Unhappy being naked, Aidan took a quick shower, holding onto the handle in it, hurrying to get something back on. Sitting on the ground, he took the socks he had worn on his hands, slipping the right one over his cock before starting to masturbate into it. A few minutes later, after he repeated that process with the left on of that pair, Aidan carefully placed the sock he wore on his feet yesterday, slipping the left one on his cock and the right into his ass crack before slipping a new diaper around his waist. After securing it, he slipped the still dripping wet socks onto his feet before slipping a new pair of pants over his diaper. After putting on a shirt, fixed the bib-sock and balled up the pacifier sock for himself, he placed the slightly stiff socks he had masturbated in the night before onto his hands, finishing his outfit.<br />
After slipping into his shoes, he crawled over to his kitchen, starting his coffee maker and made himself a piece of toast with cheese before dropping it into his mixer, before adding coffee, milk and sugar into it, making his whole breakfast one liquid to drink.<br />
Just as he finished his drink, Mark ringed the bell. Aidan thought maybe he should give Mark a key, as he was so helpful to him. It wasn´t long before they headed out, making their way to their classes, with Mark holding Aidan up so he could walk.<br />
<br />
As the separated at the uni, Aidan was quickly down and crawling to his class, making Mark laugh as he went to his own. While in class, like he had guessed, Mark was far too distracted by planning to concentrate on the class itself.<br />
Aidan had his regular problems in class. Working with his sock-gloves wasn´t easy, as they were limiting his flexibility. That resulted in his work getting sloppier and less detailed, but to him, that was normal.<br />
At their school, two of the trio had similar, if not worse problems as Aidan. Chris could hardly hold a pen to write with his fists, and when he managed to secure the pen against his fingers, his writing looked terrible. As to him that was normal now, he had no problem reading his scrawl, but others couldn´t as easily. Adding to that was the problem that Chris, being forbidden from furniture, sat on the ground, making reading the board hard as well.<br />
Justin had similar writing problems to Chris. With his “two-fingered” hands he couldn´t hold a pen normally as well, making his writing just as bad as Chris´s. He had to secure the pen between his stiff fingers, but it was far to shaky that way, so he had his own scrawl. Another issue was his growing hunger, and each time someone threw some paper away he had to resist running to get it as a snack. All that inner fight resulted in him drooling onto his own papers, also making his scrawl worse.<br />
Rick was right now still able to write normally, but had other problems. Whenever he had to think about something, he would shift in his seat to let his head hang upside-down to relax, making him rather twitchy on his chair. From time to time, he tried to write with his feet, as when he dropped his head low, they would raise up, but than his writing was unreadable, as neither were his feet accurate at writing, nor could he see what he wrote exactly.<br />
<br />
In a short break between Mark´s first and second class of the day, he was suddenly addressed by his seatmate Luke, who had normally the habit of blab the whole time no professor was there. Mark had been surprised that Luke hadn´t done so yesterday, but now his luck of peace had run out, it seemed. “Hey Mark, what are you writing the whole time?”<br />
Mark sighed before turning to Luke, already annoyed to be interrupted. “Nothing that you need to know, Luke.”<br />
Luke grinned at him. “So, it isn´t class related. You weren´t really paying attention to it, after all. Maybe I can help you?”<br />
Mark´s tone got colder as he answered: “No, it isn´t and no, you can´t help. Just let me work in peace like yesterday.”<br />
Luke didn´t notice the difference in Mark´s tone. Mark knew he was far to cheerful and fearless to be intimidated by his tone. “You did notice I wasn´t there yesterday, or are you that distracted you never noticed?” He tried to read what Mark had written down, but Mark pushed his notes to the other side, sighing again.<br />
Mark turned to his laptop as he answered: “That would explain the quietness yesterday. No, I didn´t notice you were missing. Now, can you talk to someone else? I want to get this done soon.”<br />
But again, his dismissing him went by uselessly. As Luke blabbed on towards Mark, asking all kinds of questions about what he was doing, Mark decided to get his peace another way. Turning his laptop slightly so Luke couldn´t see the screen without moving around him, Mark started the chronivac up. After all, he had already thought about changing him before, only he never decided into what.<br />
Deciding on another approach then his replacing things through stomping and making him accept, Mark tapped through Luke´s profile in search of the right setting. He asked casually in between Luke´s blabbing: “Say, are you good at cooking?”<br />
Luke was surprised by that question. Normally Mark didn´t ask him anything besides trying to get him away. He knew he could be annoying, deep down, but that was him. After a few seconds of silence, only interrupted by others in the room talking, he answered: “Not really. I´m rubbish at everything done in a household, like cleaning or gardening. I can cook small things, but I don´t normally do that.”<br />
But the time Luke took to answer was all Mark needed to finally decide on how he would get his silence. As there was no easy option he could find quickly, he switched over to the text input of Luke´s profile, and wrote in his signature two words for the program, “Mark rules”.<br />
Just as Luke wanted to ask why Mark had asked that question, Mark said: “Freeze and be silent.” Much to Luke´s confusion, he really froze in his seat, head turned towards Mark, mouth half open as he just had wanted to start speaking again. Why couldn´t he move or talk?<br />
Mark sighed in relieve as he saw it working. While it had worked on his brother, his brother´s friends and Aidan, it was still interesting to see it work. Seeing the confusion was an added bonus. “Finally,” was all he said, as if he wasn´t the one responsible for it, looking back through the tabs to find what to make Luke. It was more for inspiration than for the change itself, because Mark could simply use words to change Luke right now.<br />
When Mark heard their professor call for Luke to look forward, Mark quietly said: Turn your head forward and look normal, but keep frozen and silent.” Luke had no idea how Mark did it, but just like he said, he turned to gaze forward, a slight smile on his lips. Part of him was confused, the other was shocked of what control Mark had over him suddenly.<br />
Mark made a small input that Luke would be ignored by everyone beside him until he deleted the command, as well as nobody noticing when he spoke to him, before he wrote down everything he wanted to do with Luke, not doing anything while in class. They would have time as soon as their lunch break started, and letting him sit there like a statue only able to think was a nice little revenge for getting annoyed by him the whole time. It would be comfortable three hours for him, and painful slow-going ones for Luke, he was sure of it.</p>
