<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack waited, hoping the effects of the condom would reverse seeing as it was destroyed. But as he sat there, staring at his new horsecock, the realization that he was going to be stuck with it was becoming more and more obvious. Jack sighed, pulling his boxers back up and trying to hide his growth as best he could. It wasn&#39;t easy, shit it was downright impossible. Even with his cock inside its sheath, there was still an enormous bulge. And Jack couldn&#39;t do a thing about his massive balls. His scrotum was like the size of two grapefruits. <br />
<br />
Though his arousal was gone, Jack still felt like he was hard. It was just that he wasn&#39;t used to having such a large and meaty tool. He tried walking, which turned into more of a waddle. Trying to close his legs resulted in the painful squeezing and pinching of his nuts against his thighs. <br />
<br />
Jack managed to make it from his bedroom to the bathroom where he planned on inspecting his cock a bit more. Mostly out of curiosity, and morbid shame. He&#39;d done this to himself, and now he had to deal with the fact that instead of a normal human dick, he had a giant horsecock attached to his crotch. But his plans were seriously derailed when there the doorbell to his place went off. Jack froze and hoped whoever it was would go away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jack you awake?&quot; his girlfriend called, knocking on the door. Jack remained motionless, even as he heard her using her key to open the door. Then he jumped into the bathroom, locking the door and situating himself inside the shower. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jack? I know you&#39;re here, your car&#39;s outside and your phone was on the kitchen table. What&#39;s up? Did you forget you said you&#39;d take me out tonight?&quot; Jack&#39;s girlfriend Becca was wandering through the house searching for him. She couldn&#39;t help but notice the strong animal-like smell in the bedroom. Had Jack gone to a barn? Or was this some weird musk meant to turn girls on?<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, Jack come out. If you&#39;re trying to scare me, this isn&#39;t funny.&quot; Becca said sternly. She saw there was a trail of... something leading to the bathroom. At first Becca thought it was just water. But there were thick globs of whatever the heck it was on the floor. Definitely not water. Pressing her ear against the door, Becca could hear Jack shifting in the shower, moving the curtain and skidding against the porcelain tub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack, what are you doing in there?&quot; She already had a good idea, but asked just to tease him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, nothing. Just finishing taking a shower.&quot; Jack called back, his voice cracking several times. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, what&#39;s going on? Are you drunk or something? And why does this place smell so bad? Your landlord is going to have a fit. Remember how pissed he was that you painted the garage? Think of how mad he&#39;ll be when he finds out your turned your house into a barnyard!&quot; Becca said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Jack said quickly, voice again cracking. His discomfort was reaching new levels as he continuously tried to adjust his boxers so that his cock was less obvious. But every time he moved the waistband, it found new ways to snap his manhood to his body in uncomfortable positions. Jack winced when he pinned the very sensitive head of his cock to his abdomen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay in there? You&#39;re giving yourself a prostate examine right?&quot; Becca could hear Jack&#39;s grimaces in pain. She was really only half joking about the prostate thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Becca, I can&#39;t explain this. Can you just go please? I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t think you need to... to get all worried over something stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my boyfriend, I&#39;m always worried about you doing stupid things. What&#39;s wrong? Do you need me to call someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Jack almost shouted. The last thing he wanted was to end up the local news story, &quot;Horny Teenager Grows Horsecock at Eleven&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok. Calm down. Then what can I do to help? Please Jack, just tell me what&#39;s going on with you.&quot; Becca asked. <br />
<br />
Jack remained silent for a few minutes before stepping out of the shower and going to the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I tell you, you promise not to laugh or make fun of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that depends, how stupid of a mistake did you make?&quot; Becca challenged. <br />
<br />
&quot;See for yourself.&quot; Jack opened the door and stepped out. Becca&#39;s jaw almost dropped. She always bragged to her girlfriends about Jack&#39;s cock. It was on the bigger side, still fairly average. But this, it looked like he&#39;d stuck a bunch of apples into his shorts. His balls, she could see the outline of his scrotum in his boxers and they were massive. Bigger than any she&#39;d ever seen before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, there&#39;s more.&quot; Jack said, red with shame. His pulled his shorts down and this time Becca&#39;s jaw did drop. There was something she&#39;d seen before on animals, but it was on her boyfriend. The source of the smell no doubt, Jack at a sheath on his groin. A big black sheath that looked suspiciously like a horse&#39;s. But that couldn&#39;t be it.... he couldn&#39;t have.... how was that even possible...?<br />
<br />
Jack told Becca what happened. Going to the adult store, buying the condoms and putting one one. And of course, growing a horsecock. Becca tried not to, but she got kinda turned on from the story. Her imagination got the better of her, and she imagined Jack stroking his bigger tool. <br />
<br />
&quot;Becca are you alright?&quot; Jack asked, watching his girlfriend&#39;s face flush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, oh yes sorry. I got a little....&quot; Becca trailed off as she saw Jack&#39;s body responding to sensing a female&#39;s arousal. His cock was slowly tenting his shorts, and Jack quickly took notice. Blood surged through his veins, and his cock sprung to its full size in no time. They both stared at Jack&#39;s cock like it was some sort of phallic god. And they both wanted it, in different ways. <br />
<br />
Before she even knew what she was doing, Becca was on her knees stroking the length of Jack&#39;s massive tool. He was moaning, and gripping the doorknob to keep from falling over. His legs felt weak, and his cock was quivering from the pleasure. Becca&#39;s soft hands worked up and down, pulling the medial ring which turned out to be the second most sensitive spot on Jack&#39;s phallus.</p>
