<br />
Jeff started showing signs of precocious puberty as early as age two. His parents noticed he was actually growing at a much faster rate than other children, and a diagnosis soon followed. Jeff would always be bigger than other kids, all the way up to adulthood. As a rare genetic anomaly, Jeff would just have to learn to get used to looking much more mature than his peers. Not wanting to isolate or deprive him of socialization, doctors urged his parents to make sure he got plenty of exercise and interaction with other children. <br />
<br />
When Jeff started preschool, his parents had to explain that Jeff only looked like an 8 year old boy. Jeff had to be coached on how to play with little kids much smaller than himself. He was very popular in preschool because he could help other kids do things like reach the monkey bars, push them on swings, and go really fast on the merry-go-round. Unfortunately, in spite of his best efforts, Jeff accidentally hurt a few of his classmates. His parents talked to other parents who were concerned for the welfare of their children and they encouraged them to socialize him with other kids. As a result, Jeff was four years old when he first joined a little league team...filled with 8 year olds. Finally, Jeff had kids his own age to spend time with! But he was still learning his ABC&#39;s and other kids made fun of him for his reading skills not being the same as theirs. When he started growing taller than them, they clammed up more. <br />
<br />
When Jeff was in kindergarten, he was the size of a 10 year old boy. From that point on, the school principal, teachers and Jeff&#39;s parents came to the conclusion that they should encourage him to always help the teacher maintain discipline in the class. Jeff was encouraged not to goof off and act silly because he looked older than kids his age, and he had to act older as a result. In exchange, Jeff was the &quot;policeman&quot; of the playground for the younger kids, and he often intervened when kids were fighting, especially when bullies were picking on one of the smaller and more defenseless children. Jeff earned the moniker of class helper and at the end of the year, at the school awards assembly, he earned a ribbon for &quot;Most Protective Student&quot;. In grade 1, he didn&#39;t grow much further to the relief of his parents, and he earned another ribbon for &quot;Best School Protector&quot;. He always was very careful when playing with other children because they were so much shorter than him. In grade 2, when he was seven years old, he grew to the size of a sixth grader. Grades K through 3 were always on a separate side of the schoolyard from grades 4 to 6. Everyone knew about the giant second grader because they could all see him at lunchtime looking very out of place at the little kids table. Some of the older students made fun of Jeff but he ignored them and his friends all told him that they liked that he was so tall. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s reputation as a &quot;friendly giant&quot; again became apparent as year after year, he got awards and the principal began talking with him every month about what it was like to be the tallest and more mature looking boy in his grade. He gave Jeff pointers about how to behave maturely. Jeff&#39;s parents were always busy with their jobs, but at home he became productive and his father used him for chores much more than a regular boy his age would be doing. Jeff learned to mow the lawn and use a leaf blower at age 7 and by age 8, he was the size of a 13 year old and he entered puberty. Jeff had started growing peach fuzz by age 7 but now he was shaving at least once a week in 3rd grade. The only kid he knew who had to shave was a Mexican kid in grade 6. Jeff was now as tall as his teacher, and he could tell it scared her a little, which made Jeff a bit shy around her. Being around the older kids gave him the opportunity to play sports more, which he always excelled at. In school, he had to be very careful. <br />
<br />
Outside of school, Jeff&#39;s father enrolled him in judo and karate classes, which Jeff loved. He loved being with kids his own size, though all of them were in junior high and he was only a 4th grader, he felt he had more in common with them than kids his own age. At the same time, Jeff&#39;s friends in elementary school started to shy away from spending time with him. Parents started to tell their kids they didn&#39;t want Jeff hanging around their children due to his super hormones. They didn&#39;t trust him, and this caused him some real emotional pain until a few parents of his best friends had a long talk with him and his parents about &quot;boundaries&quot;. Jeff was expected to &quot;behave himself&quot; around their little girls especially. Jeff&#39;s parents reassured him he hadn&#39;t done anything wrong, but they knew that Jeff had begun masturbation. In fact, one of the teachers caught him in a bathroom stall one day and reported it to the principal, which led to a very long talk with the male principal, who instead of coming down harshly on Jeff, decided to be frank with him about sex and appropriateness. Jeff apologized and said he&#39;d try and do better. <br />
<br />
But inwardly, he was experiencing something none of his friends were. He had discovered porn online and brain just about exploded as he started fantasizing about sex. He desperately wanted to start dating girls, but instead of allowing this his dad signed him up for various baseball and soccer teams, as well as camping in summer, always with older kids his own size. His father also started showing him how to use power tools like a grown man. Jeff felt really powerful the first day he operated a chainsaw and helped his dad chop some logs apart on the family property. <br />
<br />
By grade 5, Jeff looked like he was 16 and began experimenting with growing a mustache. His mother finally put her foot down and made him shave it off. In public, people started to call him &quot;sir&quot;. Coaches started to take a real interest in him when they found out his real age, giving him special tips on exercise. By grade 6, Jeff discovered weights and he started to pack on muscle. He developed the same five-o-clock shadow his father had and was often mistaken for a young adult at this point, though he was still getting around by bicycle. Jeff&#39;s father started showing Jeff how to drive a car in parking lots. He was growing much taller at this point and passed the six foot mark right before he entered grade 6. At this point, all the boys were vying to be his friend and hang out with him. The dry spell for friendship had ended. He was now the most popular kid in school. Everyone wanted to be on his team. <br />
<br />
It was difficult to hang out with other sixth grader kids, because he looked like their older brother. He longed to hang out with &quot;kids his own age&quot; and he started to hang out with his martial arts friends. He got into skateboarding and met a bunch of high school kids at the park who he befriended. Before he knew it, he was going to high school parties and leaving his grade 6 friends, with their birthday parties and pinatas behind, in exchange for beer and girls in bikinis. His new muscles were coming in and even though he way outpowered any kid in elementary school, he was still jealous of the defined bodies of the high school jocks he started hanging out with. <br />
<br />
Jeff lost his virginity before the end of grade 6 and after that, his life became a rollercoaster of emotion. He couldn&#39;t really tell a girl his real age, but he now looked like a grown man. In junior high, he was mistaken for a janitor or someone&#39;s older brother. Kids were shocked when they learned that the dude with the goatee was actually only 12 years old! By the time Jeff graduated from junior high, he was leading his school&#39;s football team and he was personal friends with his coach, who spent a great amount of personal time with Jeff. <br />
<br />
It was at this point that Jeff really started to discover his love for muscle and muscular men. Girls were fun, but he soon realized he also had feelings he didn&#39;t expect for other men. He only told his coach, who said it was totally understandable. He secretly took Jeff to a gay nightclub where he met men for the first time, had alcohol and made out with men old enough to be his father. His coach was also gay, as it turned out, and was developing very paternal feelings for Jeff. They smoked cigarettes together. Jeff loved smoking from the moment he tried it and his coach boyfriend supplied him with as much tobacco as he wanted. <br />
<br />
Although he didn&#39;t have his driver&#39;s license, his father and coach let him drive everywhere with them and he was totally acclimated to all aspects of driving. <br />
<br />
In high school, he became a virtual god. No kid could match him. Not even the seniors. Jeff was the size of a truck. Entering grade 9 at 240 pounds and topping off at 6&#39;3&quot;, Jeff was now only a few inches shorter than his enormous father. Like father, like son! his dad would often tell him. His high school coach declared himself the luckiest coach in the world as Jeff became an all star quarterback right from the beginning and became high school football captain within only one semester. He conferred with his coach all the time and became friends with several male teachers on campus. <br />
<br />
Jeff started hanging out with adults as he entered his physical 20s. He aged quickly in front of everyone&#39;s eyes, becoming a sturdy, handsome, chiseled bodybuilder who looked to be twice everyone else&#39;s age. By the age of 16, he was smoking a cigar in his new car, driving to the clubs and getting laid whenever he wanted to. He started fucking boys his own age even though he looked like he could be their father. Legally, he knew he could get away with it, so why not enjoy it while he could? <br />
<br />
Jeff exploded into muscle and his hair started to recede, much like his father&#39;s had. He had a much wider forehead now, which men and women alike found quite mature and very sexy. He was DILF material at this point. He tipped the scales at 260 pounds of pure hunk. <br />
<br />
On occasion, Jeff met a nice woman who really appreciated his body. Jeff didn&#39;t feel quite as comfortable having sex with younger girls and preferred older women that looked to be his own age. In a few instances, because sex for him was so frequent, it turned out to be with the moms of the kids he went to school with. Jeff banged at least half a dozen PTA moms between his freshman and senior year. They were captivated by the teenage boy who looked like a real man. Jeff became incredibly proficient at sex, and though he preferred men, he soon realized there was a price to pay for his dalliances. <br />
<br />
One of the mothers in question became pregnant with his child when he was 16. Jeff looked like he was 30 years old at this point and the woman wanted to keep the baby. What complicated the matter was that she was Richard&#39;s mom, and Richard was one of his best friends. <br />
<br />
Jeff decided...</p>
