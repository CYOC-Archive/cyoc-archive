<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam felt a weird jolt run through his body as his brother glanced at him with a smirk. His entire body felt sore and stiff, as if he&#39;d forgotten his cool-down stretches after their gym session. But that stiffness usually appeared the morning after, not half an hour later. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled. &quot;You&#39;ll have to wait and see. If this doesn&#39;t prove the Chronivac&#39;s real then I don&#39;t know what will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam glanced at his arms, then looked down at his body. He didn&#39;t appear to look any different. Aside from the stiffness, he wasn&#39;t changing. But Jeff was still grinning. He started to walk over to the mirror, straining with every step. Even his prosthetic leg, designed for fluid movement, was acting up. It felt like his knees would lock up at any moment.<br />
<br />
As he got to the mirror, Adam still couldn&#39;t see anything different. He did notice that he couldn&#39;t turn his hips without moving his entire body at the same time. His legs were almost stuck in place, while his arms were difficult to move. &quot;Is this like a freezing spell or something? Or petrification... Am I turning into a statue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. &quot;You&#39;re getting close... I was thinking that since you&#39;re an army man, I&#39;d choose a suitable transformation. Give it a few minutes and you&#39;ll get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam didn&#39;t appreciate the secrecy, especially as his entire being was changing form. He didn&#39;t want a surprise, he just wanted to know what was happening to him. He stepped a bit closer to the mirror and tried to focus on anything peculiar. His skin did look oddly perfect and flawless, with a somewhat shiny sheen to it. With a bit of a struggle, he brought a hand up to his face. He felt unnaturally smooth. Even his stubbly cheeks had no roughness to them. It was almost like his stubble was painted onto his face. Even his hair had taken on an almost perfect appearance, immaculately styled and gelled into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, that&#39;s freaky...&quot; Adam muttered under his breath. He turned, having to waddle like a penguin to do so, and asked, &quot;But that doesn&#39;t make it real... Did you drug me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff burst out laughing at the suggestion. &quot;What?! When would I even have the chance? I didn&#39;t know you were going to ambush me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph... Right...&quot; Adam waddle-turned back to the mirror, unable to bend or twist his torso any longer. He slipped a stiffening arm underneath his shirt and lifted it upward. He raised an eyebrow in surprise. His torso was perfectly sculpted and missing his soft coating of body hair. He stroked his abs with curiosity, cringing at the rigid, artificial feeling. It took rock hard muscle to a new meaning. He rapped a hand against his hard abs and gulped as they made a sickening hollow sound. Adam lifted his shirt higher to check out his pecs, which looked as solid as his abs. While most of his chest hair had vanished, there were several cartoonish swirls spread across his pecs in a pale imitation. He wiped his hand across them, feeling nothing but that plastic-like smoothness. He jerked his arm back and his shirt slid back down, rumpling up halfway over his abs.<br />
<br />
Adam tried to move his arms back down but his elbows had locked into place, and his shoulders were close to seizing up as well. Having them stuck in the air let him focus on his hands. He tried to spread his fingers but it felt they were glued together. Or he thought they were until he looked a little closer to see they had actually all merged together into one vaguely fist shaped blob. There was a noticeable seam around the sides as if his hands had come out of a mould. He tried once more to separate them but his struggle only caused them to bend inwards until it looked like he was gripping something. He watched as his wrist joints sunk inwards, a noticeable gap forming between his fist and his forearm. The same thing happened around his elbows, and presumably his shoulders. They looked like the basic points of articulation you&#39;d find on a doll of some sort. Which meant... The plastic sheen to his skin, the printed on textures, the pose-able limbs... Adam finally clicked onto what was happening to him. &quot;Jeff... Am I becoming a toy...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bingo!&quot; Jeff cried out, enjoying the transformation just a little too much. &quot;Or more specifically, you&#39;re becoming an action figure, isn&#39;t that cool? What better way to prove to you the Chronivac is real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have made my leg real for one thing... You could have made me fat, made me a kid or an old man, made me a woman, or a dog, or literally anything that wasn&#39;t a fucking toy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well sor-ry!&quot; Jeff growled, still grinning. &quot;I thought you&#39;d appreciate it. You always said you wanted to be like your Action Adam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, which is why I joined the army! I didn&#39;t literally want to be an Action Adam toy! And another thing,&quot; Adam shook on the spot, trying to turn to Jeff to accentuate his point, only to realise he could no longer move anything below the neck. He clenched his teeth and turned his head, the only part that moved. He twisted it until he saw Jeff, who was staring at him with a mix of horror and glee. Adam would have raised an eyebrow in concern if his face muscles weren&#39;t beginning to freeze. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your head is kinda facing the wrong way...&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam looked down as best as he could and yelped in surprise. He&#39;d managed to twist his head backwards, now staring down at his round butt. He tried to move his head again but the fleeting moment of flexibility had passed. He looked at Jeff with pleading eyes and growled. &quot;I can&#39;t move anymore... Help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up from his seat and sighed, &quot;OK, I&#39;ll try to be careful.&quot; As he approached, Adam suddenly became aware of another change. He had been so focused on how his body was changing, he failed to notice that he had been steadily shrinking, the bedroom now looming high overhead. He had to be half the height he was originally and still diminishing at a rapid pace. He tried to avert his eyes as Jeff stood next to him, his eye-line was now at the man&#39;s crotch, but he was finding it difficult to even shut his eyelids. Jeff bent down to one knee and gripped him lightly against the waist. His hand almost swamped Adam&#39;s head as he delicately twisted it back towards the front of his body. &quot;There we are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam tried to thank him, but his lips wouldn&#39;t move. His jaw was shut tight. Now able to see his face again, he could see how far the changes had progressed. His lips were pursed together, the stern pout merely moulded onto his face. His hair was a solid clump of sculpted brown plastic atop his head. His eyebrows were drawn on, as were his eyes. They were no longer real, they were merely painted replicas. However, he was still able to see out of them. He was stuck looking forward, unable to swivel his eyes or even blink. He noticed there was a slim line around the middle of his neck, the point where his head was able to be twisted and, presumably, be detached from. He would have shuddered from the thought if he were able to move.<br />
<br />
As Jeff stepped back, Adam felt off balance. He felt his heart jump as he fell backwards. He tried to brace for impact but none of his body reacted. He hit the wooden floor with a thwack but Adam didn&#39;t feel any pain. &quot;Mmmm... MMMMMM!!&quot; he mumbled aloud until he got Jeff&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned back. &quot;Oh! Sorry bro, I guess you&#39;re nearing the end.&quot; He crouched down and lifted Adam up by the waist. If Adam could tremble in his new form, he&#39;d be shaking like a tree in a hurricane. His brother was now giant beyond belief! He could feel Jeff gripping him in his huge palms, his fingers pressed against the entirety of his plastic torso. It felt a lot like being underneath a duvet cover. He tried to make a sound but his voice was now a thing of the past. He continued to shrink within his brother&#39;s palms until there was a beeping noise from the Chronivac. TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE. Adam had been reduced to a mere plastic action figure in minutes.<br />
<br />
Jeff was amazed at how much the toy looked like his brother, even if he&#39;d seen him transform before his own eyes. He had the same body shape, same facial structure, he even had grey cheeks to emulate Adam&#39;s unshaven face. He delicately poked the toy in the face, afraid it may come to life and bite him. But it stayed completely lifeless. Feeling bolder, Jeff held the head between his thumb and finger and gave it a little squeeze. The soft plastic deformed underneath his grip, regaining its original shape once letting go. &quot;Oh man,&quot; Jeff chuckled in awe. &quot;This is crazy... Are you even still conscious? I can&#39;t actually tell...&quot;<br />
<br />
In fact, Adam was entirely self-aware and appropriately horrified. He could feel Jeff&#39;s grip around his entire body. He could feel his head getting squished between his brother&#39;s giant fingers. He could even feel the soft swish of air from inside his skull as his malleable head reinflated. It was unnerving to say the least. There wasn&#39;t a drug or simulation around that could recreate such vivid feelings. He really was just a small plastic toy, held hostage to the whim of his brother...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff was getting more daring. He slipped off the doll&#39;s small t-shirt and rubbed a finger over Adam&#39;s hard, plastic muscles. He laughed at the fake curly hairs that were printed onto his chest. A mischievous grin spread across Jeff&#39;s face as his fingers brushed over the doll&#39;s tiny shorts. He tugged on one leg and yanked them off, stifling a chuckle at the sight of his toy brother&#39;s crotch. &quot;Looks like you really are Action Adam through and through!&quot; he said, finally erupting into a hearty laugh. If Adam could blush, his whole body would have turned red in embarrassment. His sizeable cock and heavy balls had completely disappeared, leaving him with the genital-less crotch of an action figure. He felt Jeff&#39;s grip tighten around his arms and torso as he laughed, but the tight squeeze didn&#39;t feel painful.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned his attention to the prosthetic leg that looked identical to Adam&#39;s own metal leg. &quot;It&#39;s pretty cool that even your fake leg got reduced to doll form. You don&#39;t find many disabled toys on the market.&quot; He held the limb in-between his fingers and moved it about, testing out the joints. &quot;Heh, your old toys never moved like this.&quot; But Jeff grew a little too overzealous. He gasped as he accidentally snapped the leg out of its hip. &quot;Whoops!&quot; he cried, the plastic joint dangling between his fingertips. &quot;At least it was the fake one, huh? Well, mostly...&quot; He carried his toy brother over to his desk and clumsily set him down.<br />
<br />
Adam cried out in his mind. Jeff pulled off his leg! Sure, his leg was plastic, and it was his fake one at that, but it wasn&#39;t great! If his prosthetic leg was detachable, that meant any of his joints could suffer the same fate! Now he&#39;d been dumped onto his brother&#39;s desk, surrounded by pencils as tall as lampposts and sheets of paper as long as swimming pools. His separated joint was clutched inside Jeff&#39;s rough fist, and Adam could feel his tight, sweaty grip across its entirety. Ironically, it was the first time he&#39;d felt sensation in his left leg since having it amputated and he didn&#39;t appreciate the reminder...<br />
<br />
Jeff pinned down his toy brother and carefully managed to stick his leg back into its joint with an unsettling yet painless snap. He stood Adam back up on two feet, adjusting his pose so he could stay standing, and grinned at the naked toy. &quot;Oh man, I just got an idea. Wait here!&quot; Jeff snorted at his poor attempt at humour and turned away from his desk, heading out of his room.<br />
<br />
Adam couldn&#39;t believe it. First he was literally transformed into a play toy, then stripped and humiliated as such, and now he&#39;d been abandoned? He sighed internally. Technically, he did ask for this. He asked Jeff to prove the Chronivac was real. Now he was trapped in an immovable body with no free will... Jeff was going to turn him back to normal, right? He wouldn&#39;t leave him as an action figure, that wasn&#39;t Jeff&#39;s mojo. But Adam had forced him to reveal his Chronivac, and given its incredible powers, Jeff could easily wipe his existence from Earth and trap him as a toy permanently... How long had Jeff been gone. Minutes? Hours? From his perspective, he couldn&#39;t see any natural light, just the glow of the bedroom light. It was messing with his sense of time. But given his current predicament, all he could do was wait...</p>
