<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, hey so what is all the loud talk... about, Mother, Kathy, and a goat?&quot; Father said as he having heard voices raised to loud and angry tones he came to investigate. Dear ole dad stood there and stared at the very well endowed male goat standing rather well in an upright position, as if it were a person. As he stared at the goatish form, he took note the animal hand human hands if but furry, as were its forelegs looked more like human arms, but seemed to be changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother dear, this doing witchcraft in the house by Kathy needs to stop, as really, for what purpose would she materialize a buck goat here in her bedroom and...&quot; Father saying, as his dear wife of twenty some years turned to face him and she putting two fingers to touching his mouth, she said to her husband, &quot;Shut up dear!&quot;<br />
<br />
The manner of her touching of his lips and mouth was more than a suggestion, it came as the demand of a witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now be quite and listen, as we, our family has a trial here. Your spoiled daughter has gone and because of her jealousy changed, as transformed our son Daniel. The goat standing there is what is left of our son Dan!&quot; Mother said, as to the last of what she told her husband, all there heard her voice break from the emotions she felt for a doomed son.<br />
<br />
That said and a father figure stood and began to stare at his evil-minded daughter as if by doing so he was telling her of his dismay and the disgust he had for those of the witchery who liked to use common people as targets or modeling clay for their impersonal as much wicked ambitions to do evil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan was in agreement when we began,&quot; Kat said, as if to justify what she did to Dan as partially his idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not likely,&quot; Mother said, &quot;To look at him now, he is almost all a goat animal except for his forearms and hands, so as for what purpose would he rather be a male goat, as he had sound plans of someday going to college and becoming a science teacher like his idol Mister Patterson. No Katherine, your brother is gullible and trusting, as you put him up to becoming as maybe to looking like a goat..., or a satyr through magical glamour.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know now what was done here and part of the why it happened to the dire doom of my son. Witchcraft is an art, as it can be either black or white of cause. Daniel standing there becoming a goat has his human mind still working, reasoning, and wanting to speak when he was silenced by his sister, his mind and mine are as one. I can read his anguished thoughts, and he tells me  that you Katherine, propositioned him, wishing him to become a satyr to use him as a art model for your friend Sue.  <br />
<br />
Katherine, had you stayed with your magic and using only glamour made Dan to appear as if he were in reality a satyr for Susan, we would not be needing to deal with his horrible a situation. My ideal about transporting you both to a nearby farm, and once there that Dan being by then all a buck goat, he should then use you, his evil sister as a mate. The breeding of a witch by an animal, as even one they had like you transformed a human to being a beast, the link and removal of you virginity sparks a force to giving back to Dan some of his human abilities.<br />
<br />
In a role reversal, the sexual mating of a virgin daughter/sister with a family member transformed like is Daniel, places on the foolish witch a rather overbearing desire from then and for their lifetime as such you dear shall prefer buck goats as your lovers.<br />
<br />
Dan then shall be free from you ever crafting on him any spell casting or potion poisoning to do him harm. Although he will remain a buck goat for his lifetime, you by doing what you did has extended his likely life expectancy to equal of any a witch. Ah-huh, and of what you and Dan spoke of, he if needing to be a buck goat had a wish to have the ability to change at will the length and girth of his male member to equal what he felt would better his mating a mate. I shall award him that ability, so when you two mate, he might try to stretch you to the limit of your endurance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mum..., murarrr...,&quot; Father muttered as he wished to say something now that he had a better understanding of what had happened and of the ramifications to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry, what dear, you can speak your mind now.&quot; Mother said, as her dear husband yawned and rolling his chin felt he could again speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dear, but after having heard what Kathy did to Daniel and your plan for our son to have sex with our daughter, that seems equally as a wronging!&quot; A Dad said, as worried about what of his rearing years he held to a very moral based lifestyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry dear, but my knowing my craft, the necessity for Katherine to defile her virginity with an animal is the one way to return to Dan some of what he could do if he had remained a human. If I let bygones be bygones and Katherine get away with her ruthless transformation of our son to become a herd sire male goat, then she shall find her life as following the black arts, she becoming grandiose with evil ideals. A still virgin witch forced to mate with an animal, shall after the insemination she shall discover her labia and vagina to being then as changed, she in part transformed to a doe goat sexually.<br />
<br />
Their first mating session is enough to cause on her the changes I described, but if from the sensations what Katherine shall feel, that she lets Dan do her a second time, or a third, forth, as more, she then shall show signs of her body blending with the goat breed of her brother, but she as a female goat. If she goes sexually wild for sex by Dan, and after more than four mating  sessions, then Katherine would become as a Satyress and still a witch.<br />
<br />
Knowing my daughter, my bet is that come tomorrow night, when Katherine returns home, she will be a Satyress!&quot;</p>
