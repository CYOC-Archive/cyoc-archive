<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some experiment, Louis found that simply writing one time wasn&#39;t enough to alter what Jane made of Colin&#39;s life. As long as the lie he wrote was unrelated, it did become a fact. But anything that contradicted the illustrated story disappeared from the Journal, without changing anything or making him forget he wrote it.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, nothing disappeared until he had finished writing, and he even then had a slight delay before it disappeared. Maybe if he used this to write how he wanted Colin life to be two times, it would work. But he couldn&#39;t really test, since if it worked he would forget he was the one who caused the change. (And even if it didn&#39;t, he might forget he tried.)<br />
<br />
Louis was one of those peoples that believed evil was only in the eye of the beholder, that there was no true evil. There was only chaos and order, and everyone should try to attain the always shifting perfect equilibrium between the two, which he call harmony. Paradoxically, he also believe in the absolute need in hierarchy, even in chaos.<br />
<br />
So he wrote that gods and demons were in fact working together, using the stereotypical visions humanity had of them to push humans to improve, to incite everyone to pursue their always shifting harmony, demons being the embodiment of chaos while order is embodied by gods. And no, not everyone is equal! On the lower level, you have ordinary gods and ordinary demons. Above them, you have arch-gods and arch-demons, and in the last level you have one being everyone believe to be two separate entities, the creator of the universe known as both the supreme-god and the supreme-demon, or rater the supreme-goddess and supreme-demoness.<br />
<br />
He also made it so each god only had one angel and each devil only had one demon, the only exception being the creator, who had one angel and one devil. And while he loved the fact gods looked like humans and both side used the wings of their angel or devil as their own when needed, rather than having wings themselves, he wasn&#39;t a fan of how demons looked from mostly humans to madness inducing horrors. Instead he made them look almost like a god (or goddess) would but with horns and a long, delicate and smooth but strong prehensile tail usually ending in a spade.<br />
<br />
The few demons that don&#39;t have a spade at the end of their tail get a blade instead, and are known as furies. A fury is a demon that, on top of their duties as whatever kind of demon they are, also act as the supreme-demoness&#39; enforcer. Their blade is the only thing that indicate a fury, uniform being the same as any other demon of their kind, albeit sometime with a harpy drawn somewhere on it. (The harpy being the unofficial symbol of furies.) Since no demonic uniforms impede combat, as form-fitting (and often revealing) as they are, a separate one would be more of an inconvenience than anything else.<br />
<br />
On the gods side, their counterpart are called valkyries. And while there is furies of both genders, (and even non-binary ones) valkyries are all goddesses, and don&#39;t have any other duties than acting as the supreme-goddess&#39; enforcers. They also don&#39;t have any thing that physically differentiate them from other goddesses, except maybe their more muscular body, born from their combat training. They, instead, have a special uniform, since the roman-like toga worn by other gods is so inappropriate for fighting. Said uniform used to be a clanking armor, hiding even a valkyrie&#39;s head, but with human military giving up that kind of protection, it was replaced by something more practical, especially since gods don&#39;t need armor to protect themselves. Most gods joke that the <em>new</em> valkyrie uniform is just a modified demonic uniform making the only part not covered are hands and the head, colored white with blue highlights instead of the demon&#39;s black with red highlights. Not knowing it&#39;s exactly what the form-fitting modern uniform of the valkyries is.<br />
<br />
Now it&#39;s time to speak of the incident Colin witnessed as a kid. Louis wrote it was a test for one of the accompanying adults, with the creator acting as an ordinary goddess and the demons grunts not knowing any better. After all, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time a god was turned into a demon for the need of a mission, the opposite happen just as often. Nobody had expected someone would touch the temporarily removed angel, let alone a child. Something like that <strong>never</strong> happened! Why did it now?<br />
<br />
The creator had taken on this mission because everyone need to contribute, even her. And now a kid was about to steal the divine half of her powers, not even realizing it. (Not that any god or demon realized a human could steal her powers by making their own her angel and devil.) In panic, she ran toward her angel rather than teleporting there, unconsciously undoing her disguise. It surcharged the devil that had been implanted in her. Because she still had her own devil, that new one saw her chaos magic (also called black magic) replaced by order magic (more commonly known as white magic), turning her into a devil-like angel, down to her now immaculately white but still bat-like wings.<br />
<br />
Alas, it happened at exactly the same time than Colin touching the supreme-angel still on the ground. As a result, a sort of vacuum was created, transferring all powers, knowledge and cognitive ability of the creator to the young boy. It also gave him her devil and devil-like angel, on top of her original angel. And the original creator didn&#39;t exist anymore.<br />
<br />
With his newfound powers, he made everyone forget what happened, demons include. He couldn&#39;t let humans know the highest god was also the highest demon, and if anyone discovered it was possible to make the creator&#39;s powers their own it would spell disaster. Colin blinked to the higher plane of existence, directly in the creator&#39;s chambers, making a sing meaning to not intrude under any pretext appear on the doors, and started studying his situation.<br />
<br />
While he now had all of the creator&#39;s powers, along with the brain and knowledge to use them correctly, he somehow still was Colin. He also had a devil and two angels, which would be worrying if he couldn&#39;t feel the devil-like one becoming an angel/devil hybrid, able to manipulate the two kind of magic. (But still with white bat-like wings.) He could tell that he somehow still counted as human, to the point that unless he manifested the creator&#39;s original angel or devil, not even the arch-gods or arch-demons would identify him as the new creator, and manifesting them would pause problems. (And manifesting the hybrid would be worst.)<br />
<br />
But he had all the knowledge of the creator, which let him know that wearing divine garments made the previous creator appear as the supreme-goddess, without any trace of her demonic side, while having demonic clothes on gave her look the part of the supreme-demoness, her divine side apparently absent. Maybe he could do the same?<br />
<br />
Entering his predecessor&#39;s walk-in closet, he undressed and took one of her goddess uniform before putting it on. He didn&#39;t need to look in the nearby full-body mirror to know he looked like a woman. In fact, he looked exactly like the previous creator did as the supreme-goddess. No, it was more than just looking, he really was the supreme-goddess right now, albeit a supreme-goddess that felt uncomfortable because she hadn&#39;t put on any underwear.<br />
<br />
Putting the divine uniform back were he found it, Colin now decided to try a demonic one, but with the appropriate underwear this time. Simply putting on the panty was enough to change the little boy into the very mature demoness that is hell&#39;s ruler, but he still put on the bra and uniform. Looking into the nearest mirror, Colin was surprised nobody had discovered the supreme-demoness and supreme-goddess were one and the same. Sure, in demoness form she had horns, a demon tail and was tanned, were as a goddess her skin was as pale as can be. But outside of that, it was the exact same body, with the exact same face, the exact same long undulating red hairs and even the same soulful green eyes. Granted, in demonic form the eyes might be cat-like instead of human-like, and her nails far more sharper, but still… Dit the separate persona his (her?) predecessor created for each role affect people so much? Or were her powers preventing anyone from noticing?<br />
<br />
Looking around, Colin also noticed a uniform that looked somewhat in between a demon&#39;s and a valkyrie&#39;s. While the goddess uniforms masked without effort the creator&#39;s demonic aura, and her demoness uniforms did the same for her divine one, that special one was for the rare case a joint meeting between arch-gods and arch-demons was needed. During such rare events she liked to display both auras simultaneously, and this uniform was the only one letting her do so without going in the nude.</p>
