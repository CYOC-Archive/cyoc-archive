<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha left the new home that the Ross family had moved into with some feeling of comfort at how things went. A lot of it was due to the strangely high and open acceptance of things that the Ross family displayed. It wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but neither was it common. There were always fans of were-creatures, furries, and things like that that often responded well to the were secret and the Mandatory Were Law, but they also all tended to be younger and thus more open to those sorts of things. People in their thirties and forties might ultimately accept things, but Samantha had found that they generally didn&#39;t believe weres were real at first and didn&#39;t always respond well at first when informed. Most of those in that age group that did were usually like the FBI Agent Theodore Green, in that they were already aware of the existence of weres before coming to Moon Lake and had been supportive due to that prior contact, usually a loved one.<br />
<br />
She glanced in the rearview mirror and soon saw the workmen resuming their unloading of the truck as she headed up the straight road that would take her back toward the center of Moon Lake&#39;s wagon wheel layout. It let her thoughts ponder on things that had come up in introducing the Ross family to Moon Lake&#39;s secrets. While she couldn&#39;t necessarily say with authority whether or not they were &quot;fans&quot; of anthropomorphic animals, she could note that Kent and Diana didn&#39;t really believe weres were real until after Tad had displayed a partial transformation, but yet once they recognized that and got over the initial shock, they seemed to be highly accepting in a way that was normally something that Samantha had only seen with someone who was either already aware of the existence of weres, which the Ross family wasn&#39;t, or was already a fan of anthropomorphic animals, which Samantha couldn&#39;t prove one way or the other. In this she had no explanation for the Ross family&#39;s very positive reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... the reaction could be indicative of things outside Moon Lake not being as bleak as many may fear it to be,&quot; Samantha mused to herself as she reached the central hub of Moon Lake and then turned onto the curved street to ultimately head to City Hall, &quot;which if other things go through... could be a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she made it to City Hall those thoughts remained with her. In most normal situations she wouldn&#39;t be working on city business on Saturdays and Sundays, at least not in a way that would require her to go into City Hall. For more often than not, Moon Lake&#39;s affairs were pretty calm, quiet, and low key. Her role as Town Chancellor and welcoming new residents might mean an occasional visit with new families, like the Ross family, but more often than not she could have that written in her calendar and handle the meeting and then return home afterward. It was only when some potential emergency came up, be it a rogue were or some specific issue that was unnaturally big when compared to normal town business that she would see a heavier than normal work-load. And right now, with Moon Lake&#39;s City Council voting to begin drawing up plans for revealing the were secret to the world there were the sort of major circumstances that would inspire greater work for much of the city government.<br />
<br />
Much of it right now was a sense of crisis management, which Samantha expected and could easily recognize after she&#39;d heard on the City Council&#39;s decision. Regardless of whether it was the right or wrong decision, weres had protected the secret of their existence fiercely, particularly after periods of persecution and fear during times when people actually believed in them, and now that secret had been a part of were society to a point where few would know anything else. And the sudden decision to reveal the were secret was going to be bound to generate some measure of worry, and while the executive branch of Moon Lake&#39;s city government didn&#39;t shape the agenda that the city council followed, they could still have to defend or coordinate things to do with that sort of policy, and Tom Herald&#39;s proposal and its acceptance had generated that. Samantha knew that as she unlocked the side door and made her way in.<br />
<br />
Things were relatively quiet as much of the low level staff likely wouldn&#39;t be in as the city&#39;s standard work hours didn&#39;t include Sundays. Though that didn&#39;t stop some people from calling in, likely wanting answers to questions on what to do and what would happen, and a few had even figured to call Samantha&#39;s line personally and left messages detailing those questions. She did her best to answer them and explain the decisions that had been made. In some cases it didn&#39;t seem like much of a comfort as the people were likely hoping for a way for the &quot;big reveal&quot; to be canceled, but actually doing that was beyond the scope of Samantha&#39;s role as Town Chancellor. She could deliver her thoughts and opinions in reports and suggestions to the City Council, but she couldn&#39;t shape what they would decide on. However, with the Ross family&#39;s introduction to Moon Lake handled Samantha had one thing that she could provide as a report that would generally be good news to those that would be worried about a negative reaction and at the same time, she would have some policy suggestions that would run if the plan was finalized and agreed on, which would require typing up a series of reports and memos.<br />
<br />
And so she carefully made her way up the second floor of City Hall and being as careful as possible not to track anything and then walking to her office where she would type up the reports that would be need and the memoranda on what she would hold as policy suggestions and requirements. When she reached the door to her offices, she looked down the hall, hoping to see some light coming from under a door and indicating that someone else was in, and she found that Katherine Chambers actually was in, which would be good news... and for the moment, Samantha decided to at least tell Kat in person. Technically the Deputy Mayor would only cast a vote if the City Council had a tie vote, which was what happened with the debate over Tom Herald&#39;s proposal, but because her primary role in those debates was to also officiate the debate as much as possible, letting her know beforehand would be a good idea. She&#39;d still type things up, but talking with Kat first seemed like the best course of action at the moment.<br />
<br />
She approached the door and knocked on it firmly before getting a &quot;come in&quot; coming from within. Samantha opened the door and entered a small entry room where Kat&#39;s secretary normally sat, but with it being a Sunday and minor staff not required to come in the secretary&#39;s desk was presently empty. However the door that then lead back toward where Katherine&#39;s main office was was open and Samantha moved toward it and found Katherine coming around her desk at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Burning some of the late week oil?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or the start of the week,&quot; Katherine admitted, &quot;depending on your point of view of when a week starts or ends... but yeah... dealing with some of the consequences that have piled up from the City Council meeting will be big. Some are worried about ending up in prisons or side shows. Some are overly eager and want to know if it will mean only transforming at night when outdoors and always away from public spaces unless as a special occasion... that sort of thing. And I can tell them what the determination of the City Council was based on the vote, which was only the existence of weres, not where they live... and thus NOT Moon Lake. And much of the rest will be up in the air until the reveal is decided, made, and reactions first come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded as those would all be things that weres would be worried over. On certain levels she was inclined to believe those who were nervous, but she also knew and recognized the reasons that had been given that made sense. It was one of the things that would likely shape the debate in Moon Lake until the big reveal was actually done.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how about you?&quot; Kat asked, &quot;Any chaotic moves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one family from Virginia,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;the Ross family... some of their paperwork for the move here came in at around the same time Jen Decker came back to Moon Lake, so some of the promotion that the father had that required the move likely came at around the same time... but the Ross family likely had some other issues to clean up first before they left and thus why they&#39;re here now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did the family take it?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprisingly well, and that&#39;s what I wanted to report to you on,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;as this could actually be something that you could give to the City Council... or at least let me know when they have their next planning sessions with Mr. Herald...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be difficult to pin down,&quot; Kat said slowly, &quot;as he has his own work schedule and I did get a couple of calls from Harold Stevens on some things that Mr. Herald has updated him on... in that his paper has him working through today and tomorrow... and then Wednesday, I think... And the meeting he has to go to for his paper is in Spokane and thus he&#39;ll need Tuesday and potentially Thursday as &quot;travel&quot; days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can work this around whatever schedule can be worked out,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;and this would be good news to hear given the circumstances if you want me to present it at one of these reveal planning meetings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat again nodded, &quot;And if you can&#39;t... a memo or report on this would be helpful.&quot; The two women then sat down and as Kat watched Samantha take her seat she then asked, &quot;so you said you had good news?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... something that could be a sign of the possible response being better than many might fear, if and when this reveal happens,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;for the family... a Kent and Diana Ross with two children. One is about eighteen and the other is likely fourteen and they did respond to the revelation that Moon Lake is a were sanctuary with a surprising degree of acceptance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was any member of the family already a were... or knows a were?&quot; Kat asked, though she was intrigued. Moon Lake&#39;s greatest fear with regard to the reveal was that the normal human reaction would be overwhelmingly negative.<br />
<br />
&quot;No member of the family was a were,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and while they know the Deckers... they didn&#39;t know that Jen is a werecat and that her son Tad is a werewolf. That I can testify to based on the introduction given and their response to it. I actually owe Tad for his help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tad... he volunteered?&quot; Kat asked, not fully aware on who &quot;Tad&quot; was, though the name &quot;Decker&quot; sounded familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Said that he was a friend of the Ross&#39;s son Connor,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;and he gave partial transformation... and at first there was surprise and wonder if I or Moon Lake had done something to him, but he actually handled himself well and they accepted it with a snap. No argument... no doubts. No Hesitancy. It was like once they got over the initial surprise, things were fine. A level of acceptance that we&#39;ve really only seen with people who were already knowledgeable of and accepting of weres or were already weres to begin with. Now... admittedly this is one family and I don&#39;t know enough on the family to know for sure if they would already fall into the sort of category that would lean in favor of these sorts of things... but given the odds... I&#39;d say it&#39;s likely that the parents at least aren&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would be a good thing if they accepted things as openly as you say,&quot; Kat commented, &quot;that would help... maybe not much... but it could ease some fears on possible negative reactions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded in agreement with that. Moon Lake would likely see a great many changes if and when this reveal went through, but the Ross family&#39;s acceptance of it was quick and seemed genuine. It didn&#39;t come off as though there was any sort of game being played on their part, and that sort of thing would go a long way to help ease fears<br />
<br />
&quot;And how did they take the Mandatory Were Law?&quot; Kat wondered, &quot;that&#39;s actually the thing you say most new residents complain about the most.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was no problem with that, actually,&quot; Samantha added, &quot;which was part of how surprisingly accepting the Ross family was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be good,&quot; Kat commented, &quot;though... while I have you here... and we&#39;re discussing things that will relate to the reveal. Where would you stand on the Mandatory Were Law post reveal? That will be a question that will come up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say it stays... for if we&#39;re not revealing Moon Lake as a were sanctuary, and the response isn&#39;t completely negative but isn&#39;t overwhelmingly positive, either... we&#39;d need it to protect Moon Lake,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;New resident to Moon Lake may accept weres but would have to become one to make sure they don&#39;t reveal that Moon Lake is where we live... or at least where we&#39;re concentrated...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may require some changes in the language,&quot; Kat commented, &quot;not to mention some may want an increased police presence should someone prove hostile. As right now... what protects the town is the secret. Should someone reject the law and manage to get out... no one will likely believe them. Once the secret is gone... that sort of thing won&#39;t work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could just be wording and selling being a were though,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and it might not even have to be force... maybe talk with the local businesses and see if they&#39;d sponsor some extra perks to new residents if they comply with the Mandatory Were Law... Might make it come off as less &quot;mandatory&quot; and more of a &quot;perk,&quot; even if the function is still the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be interesting...&quot; Kat said slowly, &quot;print out your suggestions and I can present them as your suggestions for the Mandatory Were Law after the reveal and we&#39;ll see what Mayor Stovall and the City Council have to say when they get to looking into it...&quot;</p>
