<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>It&#39;s a five day transformation so an hour doesn&#39;t change much lol</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Professor Tom Blake drove to his class. <br />
<br />
He’d had a late lunch date with a rather spicy Latina two decades younger than he was and he was ready to get the class over with so he could get ready for their real date later tonight. Economics was such a horrifically boring subject to teach. Now, out in the real world, you could make tons of money with that degree in Wall Street as a trader, professorships were more for people who had made their money and retired.<br />
<br />
Tom had been rather dumb and decided to hop on professorship early, free of the chaos of Wall Street and the markets, and now he had to put up with kids. They all thought they knew more than he did. One of them in particular, Cole, had the gall to confront him in class the other day, saying he’d recommend he be fired. Jokes on you, ya little shit, he was fucking tenured!<br />
<br />
The professor pulled into his parking spot, the sign in front bearing his name. He smirked and checked himself out in the mirror. Aging like fine wine, hair getting a little light in the front. Professor Blake gave himself finger guns and got out, walking to his class.<br />
<br />
Behind him, unnoticed, the sign in front of his car shifted and altered. ‘Professor Tom Blake’ became ‘Professor Cole Lindman’. The car itself shifted, the sleek Lincoln growing dull, spots of rust appearing on it. The shape altered as it transformed into a Corolla, the pristine leather seats inside tearing and weathering, fast food wrappers and other trash filling one side of the car. <br />
<br />
Campus security happened to pass by and caught sight of the ancient car and called a tow truck.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Class was rather boring, as per usual. Just a slideshow presentation. Cole sighed and stifled a yawn as Professor Blake droned on and on.<br />
<br />
Tons of people were dropping his class and it was obvious why. It was totally un-engaging. He couldn’t think of how to make the already rather dry topic of Economics any more uninspiring if he tried.<br />
<br />
Cole scratched his chest, the scattering of hairs growing thicker, the blonde hairs darkening.  He rolled his shoulders, his shirt feeling oddly snug. Must have been pumped from yesterday’s workout. Leg day was today, and you never skipped leg day.<br />
<br />
He was actually in a sour mood, the conversation he’d had with Zeke had really gotten him riled. Cole almost wanted to walk out of the class himself, but he actually needed to pass, and unfortunately, everything on the slideshow would be on the test. Mandatory attendance because Professor Blake was forced to attend.<br />
When Professor Blake turned, Cole noticed something off. The man’s hair was starting to thin out, male pattern baldness setting in as he grew closer to middle age. Usually, Cole could see a bald patch in the back. Today, however, his hair was looking a bit thicker. Maybe he had hair transplants?<br />
<br />
The bell rang and the class was let out. Cole walked to the parking lot, looking for his car. He couldn’t find it. He walked around the parking lot twice. Had it been towed?<br />
<br />
“Son of a bitch!” A voice yelled.<br />
<br />
Cole turned and saw his Economics professor throwing a tantrum. People were starting to stare. The man was shouting at a security guard, who was apologizing profusely.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, they towed it?”<br />
<br />
“It was a beat up jaloppy, sir, how was I supposed ot-”<br />
<br />
“A Lincoln is <I>not</I> a beat up jaloppy, you stupid fucktard!” Professor Blake jabbed the security guard in the chest with his finger.<br />
<br />
That might have been a bridge too far. The security guard grabbed his radio and backed away. Professor Blake didn’t seem to notice the guard’s hand move to his taser.<br />
<br />
“Professor?” Cole called.<br />
<br />
“What?!” Professor Blake asked, flustered. “Oh, you. Great. You gonna lecture me about my class now, out of all the goddamn times you-”<br />
<br />
“Need a ride?” Cole spoke quickly.<br />
<br />
“Do I need a ride?” Professor Blake hung his head. “Yes. Thank you. Someone around here has some courtesy.”<br />
<br />
They walked the parking lot together. The guard had not ended up following through with his call. Cole felt like he’d done his good deed for the day. But still, he couldn’t find his car.<br />
<br />
“So, where’s your car?” Professor Blake asked, scanning the parking lot.<br />
<br />
“No idea.” Cole sighed.<br />
<br />
“Then why the hell-!”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t want you arrested.” Cole explained. “That dude looked like he was going to call campus police.”<br />
<br />
“...Thanks.” Professor Blake sighed. <br />
<br />
“I wonder if my car got towed, now.” Cole said.<br />
<br />
“Have you tried setting off the alarm?” Professor Blake rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Cole pulled out his keys and stared. <br />
<br />
They weren’t the keys he remembered. His were a beat-up square of plastic. This was heavy duty. One of those remote start vehicles. Had he…somehow picked up someone else’s keys?<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter? Hurry up and press it.” Professor Blake said impatiently.<br />
<br />
Cole thumbed a button on the fob and the alarm went off…Right where he thought he’d parked his car. But it wasn’t his car at all. No, his car was a beat-up old Taurus he had to buy with his own money. This….this was a beast. A gorgeous Army Green 4x4 Ford. The newest model.<br />
<br />
“Nice wheels, kid.” Professor Blake grinned and slapped his back, walking towards it.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t right.” Cole muttered, but followed the Professor anyways.<br />
<br />
“What’s not right?” Professor Blake asked as he got in.<br />
<br />
“I don’t own this car. My parents made me buy my own vehicle.” Cole explained.<br />
<br />
“Well…if it isn’t stolen, then maybe they bought it for you as a gift?” Professor Blake smiled. “Anyways, making your kids pay their way is noble and all, but bad.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Think about it. Do you know of any rich family which does that? No.”<br />
<br />
”Maybe they’d be more responsible.”<br />
<br />
“Or maybe they’d just be poor. Making economic decisions does not involve morality, Cole. It’s about providing the best service for a client. For your own kids.” Professor Blake said. “Imagine rich parents do what you do to their kids. He buys a clunker with his crappy job. Everything is fine for six months, but oops, buyer didn&#39;t disclose the engine troubles. One day while driving to work mid-winter, it dies. Now he can’t get to school or to the part-time job he holds down because his parents stiffed him on the meal fees. He doesn’t even board in student housing, he rents.”<br />
<br />
“And?”<br />
<br />
“Stress. It&#39;s all about removing stressors from your child&#39;s life so they can focus on success. College is stressful enough without having to balance working, feeding yourself, and having reliable transportation. What they’ve created is not a responsible adult, but a train-wreck waiting to happen. He fails out of school and moves back in with his parents. That’s a year wasted.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not true for everyone.” Cole paused, “Where am I dropping you off at?”<br />
<br />
“My house.” Professor Blake gave him the directions.<br />
<br />
Cole realized the professor lived in one of the rich subdivisions. “Oh those are nice.”<br />
<br />
“They’re okay.” Professor Blake snorted.<br />
<br />
“What?” Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Ya got social media?”<br />
<br />
Cole nodded.<br />
<br />
“My friends do too. Every last one of them lives in a chintzy penthouse in New York.”<br />
<br />
“...You’re jealous?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Professor Blake stared out the window. “Yeah, I fucked up.”<br />
<br />
“But you’re a teacher! You’re, like, tenured.” <br />
<br />
“So? It’s not what I wanted to do.” Professor Blake sighed,<br />
<br />
“I can tell….” Cole muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?”<br />
<br />
“I said we’re nearly there.” Cole smiled.<br />
<br />
“Uh-huh.”<br />
<br />
Blake dropped him off outside his palatial mansion and drove back to school. One more class and he&#39;d be done for the day. He scratched his chin, feeling thick blonde stubble there, thicker than normal. It wasn’t a huge deal, so he wrote it off, not even noticing the backs of his hands growing hairier as well.</p>
