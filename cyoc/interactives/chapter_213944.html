<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The blackest of nights would be insignificant to describe the almost penetrating Darkness that embraced Corbin as he free fell down, forever and ever. His initial state of constant spinning and maneuvering had died down now, allows for a gentle falling pose as he careened down further. <br />
<br />
Fear struck through his mind. What if there was no end to this abyss? It was a video game Afterall, there are pre-set boundaries and kill-zones in place to keep everything tidy in it&#39;s little prison. Alas, it was also relatively obvious this game was having some impact on reality as well. Ever since he had started falling, Corbin had been...floating in his room, holding onto the controller as a rope to the floor. A state of terminal velocity, unable to fall faster and stuck in this loop.<br />
<br />
If this was the end, it was a frustrating one to say the least. He thought the battle against the minotaur went quite well, outside of the rest of the room collapsing it was a worthwhile victory that deserved a worthwhile reward. Alas, falling gracefully, was the closest thing he felt to peaceful comfort ever since he got here. A gentle breeze rushing through his matted fur. <br />
<br />
SEVERAL HOURS PASS....<br />
<br />
No change graced the ever illuminating dark corridor he found himself falling down. Corbin thought to himself that if there was going to be an end, it would have to be visible at some point right? Especially with his enhanced vision. Alas, no landing site and no light above to pull him to safety. Just constant falling. Falling, and even more falling.<br />
<br />
SEVERAL MORE HOURS PASS...<br />
<br />
Corbin in real life, looked down at the console, churning loudly it&#39;s echoing fans cooling the main GPU found within. He found it funny that the device capable of all this incredible magic required 2 dingy fans to stop it from overheating. A thought crossed his mind, what if he turned off the game? Yes it was mentioned before that he would have to complete his quest to return to sanity but he didn&#39;t know how much longer he would last if this was the rest of his experience.<br />
<br />
Falling.<br />
Growing more and more frustrated.<br />
<br />
Corbin takes a breath in real life, examining certain things in his room. Never really taking the time to appreciate what he had befo-<br />
<br />
WHAM. A loud crashing sound followed by a numbing pain overtook Corbin as he landed in what felt like a cement floor. Alas, he sunk further and further into this mysterious solution. It was water...or at least some kind of liquid. He gasped, clawing and swimming upwards, the pain receding, faster than he was expecting. <br />
<br />
He should be dead, a fall from that height would of minced any creatures meat. Terminal Velocity, and yet the pain had already disappeared. <br />
<br />
Breaking his head above the water barrier, Corbin searched around for any identifiable landmark. The liquid making it extremely hard to see, it was still dark but he could make out the side of a stone coast. Maybe because he was already wet, Corbin didn&#39;t feel the rain trickling off his snout, splashing in cascades within the body of water surrounding him. Black as the night. He was inside some kind of cave, and lo and behold, the magic continued, as looking up there was a ceiling, pure stone with stalagmites piercing out from the roof in sharp maws.<br />
<br />
Climbing up onto the coast, Corbin checked his own appearance and inventory to see if anything had changed. The few items he had were still there, but alas still no food. His stamina was mostly depleted as well. Food was a necessity at this point. His startling minotaur body was still intact thankfully, and it looked like the water hadn&#39;t changed anything about his appearance.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a loud groaning emanated 60 feet North of where Corbin was currently standing. He grabbed for his weapon but found nothing, separate from his inventory, his weapon had completely vanished. &quot;Well shit...&quot; Corbin muttered frustrated. He walked closer to the noise, wary of any sudden movements. From the darkness he was shocked to see....<br />
<br />
The Minotaur.<br />
<br />
Considering the state he left it in, he was surprised to see it this small still. Yes he was a lot larger now, but his changes had seemingly ceased entirely. The bulging form laid on all fours in front of him, it&#39;s muscles no longer pulsating with corrupted spirit. Again a groaning released itself from this creature, but it sounded more calm and gentle...almost like it was Sleeping. It was, it had to be. Corbin walked a little closer, round the side to examine it&#39;s head. A momentary crater had formed below it as well, it also fell down here, so it was either knocked out or it voluntary chose to sleep. Either option didn&#39;t sound likely considering it&#39;s God-like appearance.<br />
<br />
Numerous options presented itself, as he had a prime opportunity to claim a considerable amount of EXP from killing this creature. Alas he wasn&#39;t sure if his hit would be enough to end him completely.</p>
