<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin walked out across his front lawn carring a large hefty bag filled with trash. He heaved it into the trash can and started on his way back. It was his responibility to keep the house clean. His parents had left for the week, for their anniversary. He was 18 and a high school senior. He was 6'2 but ony weighed about 140. He had tried out for the basketball team two years ago, but didn't make the cut, then one of his friends suggested he try out for the swim team. Justin's weight and height made him perfect for swimming, so did his size 13 and a half feet. He really didn't want to wear a speedo. Whenever he had swam, he had always just worn board shorts or something like that. When he stepped on to the pool deck for the first time, he saw that all the guys were wearing speedos, so he went back into the lockerroom and changed. Every guy on the team stopped what they were doing as Justin walked by. &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; he thought, I must have screwed it up some how, it's probably on backwards or something and I didn't even realize it. The coach came right up to him and said &quot;Very funny, if you really wanna join this team your gonna have to stop messin' around, got it?&quot; and with that said, the coach reached down into Justin's speedos to get out whatever he had stuffed down there to make it look like a tall scrawny kid was packing porn star material. <br />
<br />
Justin couldn't understand what the coach was talking about. Coach was a big young guy, heavly muscled with a thin coat of blond chest hair. He had kept in shape by playing water polo to this day. He watched as the coach shoved his hand down his crotch and grab hold of his cock. He just stood there, speechless, the coach was touching his dick, no, he was doing more than touching it, he was tugging on it, pulling it, NO! Justin thought, not now! he was starting to get hard! Why is the coach making me throw a boner in front of everyone, why is he picking on me? Justin looked around to see if any of the other boys would help him. That's when he noticed their speedos, actually, what their speedos had inside them. Most of them had pretty normal sized buldges, some guys were smaller than the others, some guys were bigger, but no one, not even the coach, had a bigger package than he did. His speedo was almost overflowing with his package. The coach noticed it was getting warmer and tighter in the kid's speedo. He quickly pulled his hand out. &quot;Jesus Christ, boy! Is that all really you in there?&quot; Shouted the coach. <br />
<br />
Justin had never known how big his dick was. In normal P.E. no one ever saw another guy's body, if you weren't on a team, you really didnt have to work out or do anything. So most people had just changed their shirts and pants most of the time. They didn't even make them wear cups or shower after P.E. what was the point? No one ever worked up a sweat. Justin had always thought he was average down there. The coach quickly walked Justin back into the locker rooms and then into the showers. The entire swim team followed. The coach peeled of his speedos and everyone else did the same. Justin was the last to do it, every pair of eyes was watching him. Finally, his cock flopped out, it was a perfect match for his body, it was long, pale and even a little thin, with veins running across it. His balls were about the size of golf balls and hung low. He didnt have a lot of hair, mostly just a dirty blond patch above his cock and coating his balls. The coach got out a tape measurer and gently took hold of Justin. Justin remained motionless. He had the entire swim team circled around him, looking at his tool, while the coach measured it. The coach called out to everyone. It was 8 inches soft. The rest of the boys looked down at their dicks. None of them were anywhere near that length soft, most weren't near it hard, either! The coach slowly peeled back the foreskin on Justin's rod. &quot;Oh! Please! Don't touch me there! Ohhhhhh!&quot; Justin moaned. The coach pulled the skin back farther and then pulled it over the tip of Justin's mushroom head. Justin's eyes closed and his whole body shuddered when the coach did this to him. He could hear a slapping noise start around him, it was faint at first, and then it was everywhere. He opened his eyes and looked down. Coach's thick muscled hand was slowly pulling his foreskin over his head and back again. Then he looked up and saw where that slapping noise was coming from. Every boy on the swim team was jacking off around him, their eyes all watching his cock get a hand job from coach. From the 4'9 freshman who hadn't even hit puberty to the seniors who weren't even carded for buying a beer. Justin looked around, he saw shaved bodies  heaving with sharp breathes, the muscles throughout their bodies tensing up, some of them flexed thier legs while they jerked, others made their abs or chest flex. Some had their mouths slack open. Their nipples turned hard at the excitment their bodies were reaching. They began rubbing their crotches, their chests and stomachs, and even their asses. <br />
<br />
He heard a small whimper, it was one of the freshman. A Mexican kid who was only about 5'1 and had just a few dark hairs around his cock, but his balls had had dropped down to a good length. His face crumpled up, and he whimpered again, his tiny hand a blur on his dark young meat. He grunted and a few small jets of cum flew out of him and landed on Justin's feet. The coach stopped jerking Justin and moved into the circle with the rest of the swim team and began jerking himself, hard and fast.<br />
<br />
This seemed to be the signal for every one else in the showers. Every guy in there started shooting, unloading thier jizz, all on Justin. Moans, grunts, and a few whimpers could be heard coming from all directions. It had started on his feet, and then he felt some strings land on his shins and claves. The jets of boy cum had traveled up past his knees, along his thighs, above his waist, up his arms and chest, criss crossed his back, and stopped just at his neck. He had turned around just in time to see the coach's seed shoot out of him. Justin looked down to try and keep his face clean, it worked, but now he had cum sprayed throughout his hair. This whole time he hadn't noticed that he had been jerking himself. The smell of the swim team's boy juices pushed him over the edge. The team brought the little mexican teenage over to him and placed him right in front of Justin's rock hard 12' cock. His huge bony hand kept on pumping his member, he used the cum from all over his body to lube himself up. Finally, Justin let out a long deep moan, every muscle in his long stringy body tensed, every vien stood out. <br />
<br />
He began cuming. The first load hit the freshman in the face, and even getting in his mouth. Then his neck was coated, and his thin chest and narrow body. Justin seemed to keep going forever. He stepped closer to the mexican teen, to let his juice dribble out and cover the kid. He milked the last few drops out of himself and onto the boy's tiny cock. <br />
<br />
Or at least that was the story Franscico had heard about the high schooler who lived next door to him. Maybe he could help him out for the night, with that monster hidden in those cargo shorts.</p>
