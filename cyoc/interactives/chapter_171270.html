<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was after closing time so you had to wait until the morning before ringing the clinic and asking for an appointment. You were told that the next available appointment wasn&#39;t until Thursday (today being Monday). You had no choice but to take an appointment for 4pm on Thursday.<br />
<br />
That gave you 3 more ball less days. 3 days in which your penis remained limp and shrunken. It wasn&#39;t that you had lost further tissue mass. More that no matter what you did physically and what porn you watched you couldn&#39;t get your penis to respond. It remained flaccid.<br />
<br />
You went to work, but kept to yourself. You were embarrassed by the mess you had gotten yourself into. <br />
<br />
It was not only the lack of physical response, there was also no mental stimulus from watching your porn collection. By the time Thursday came around you were quite depressed. You knew you had made a huge mistake.<br />
<br />
You had tried to ring Mia several times but she never answered. You texted her to let her know when you had your appointment but she just texted back to say she was unavailable. <br />
<br />
Come Thursday afternoon you caught the bus back into the transfer clinic. You tried to imagine the pretty girl in the seat across the aisle naked and sucking you dick but again got no response. Your penis was now only useful as an appendage for peeing out of. It wasn&#39;t even doing that effectively though. It was so limp that you had lost your aim.<br />
<br />
You walked into the transfer clinic and up to the reception desk. No one was in the lobby. There was a button on the desk with a note saying &quot;Ring if desk is unattended&quot; you pushed it.<br />
<br />
Two minutes later a huge athletic looking man walked out. He must have been 6&#39;5 and he towered over you. You felt quite intimidated.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes can I help you?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Um. I have an appointment at 4 O&#39;clock to discuss my transfer which went wrong&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Who with?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;They didn&#39;t say. Just &quot;A representative&quot;&#39;<br />
<br />
He was looking on a computer screen &#39;What&#39;s you name?&#39;<br />
<br />
You told him. He kept scrolling on the computer and finally appeared to find something. &#39;&#39;Ah found you. Take a seat. Someone will see you soon&#39;<br />
<br />
He disappeared through a door. You took a seat on a couch. No one else was in the foyer. You picked up some advertising brochures  and were flicking through them. All the testimonials seemed to have been more successful than your transfer had been.<br />
<br />
It must have been 10 minutes before the back door opened and a gorgeous blonde woman walked out carrying a file. She greeted you and bade you follow her to a meeting room. Her name was Jennifer. You followed her, disgusted that your body was not responding to the presence of this goddess.<br />
<br />
In the room she indicated where you should sit then sat opposite you and asked &#39;So why did you want to see us?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not happy with the outcome of the transfer I made last week. I want to get my testicles back&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Mm and how are we meant to do that?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Why transfer them back of course&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Where are they? We can&#39;t give you back something we don&#39;t have&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;They are attached to Mia. The woman I swapped with&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well where is Mia? We can&#39;t produce testicles out of the air&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;She couldn&#39;t come. She said she couldn&#39;t make the appointment. I suspect she doesn&#39;t want to give me back my testicles&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hm That is a problem&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well can&#39;t you make her come back?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No. On what grounds?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;She has my balls&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well they are technically not your balls anymore. They are Mia&#39;s balls. She can do what she likes with them&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No she can&#39;t they are my balls. I just loaned them to her&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m sorry sir but you are wrong. Look here. This is your signature is it not. Witnessed by one of our representatives. Here you say that you are &quot;donating&quot; your testicles to Mia. They are Mia&#39;s testicles not yours&#39;<br />
<br />
Alarmed you had a look at the contract you, Mia and the transfer clerk had signed. For the first time you read through the fine print. There was a definition of &quot;Donate&quot;. You read it &quot;The act by which the owner of a thing, voluntarily transfers the title and possession of the same, from himself to another person, without any consideration; a gift&quot;. <br />
<br />
&#39;As you can see sir the testicles now belong to Mia. I understand you received a pair of ovaries in return. They are now legally your property as are any eggs inside them&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But this can&#39;t be right? You have left me a freak. I&#39;ll sue you&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m sorry sir. But you also signed this clause which indemnifies &quot;The Transfer Clinic&quot; from any responsibility if a client changes their mind&#39; She showed you another of the forms you had signed. &#39;Which to me seems exactly what you have done&#39;<br />
<br />
You were speechless as you read through the form she presented to you. There was no denying it was your signature.<br />
<br />
&#39;Of course you are entitled to take your grievance to arbitration, although personally I think you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on&#39; she said with a smile on her flawless face.<br />
<br />
&#39;But. But. It was only meant to be for a few days&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m sorry sir, we do not like to see unhappy clients. Perhaps there is a way we can lessen your distress. We do have a scheme where we offer free transfers where it can be proven that it will enhance the mental well being of a patient. I suspect you might fit the criteria for this scheme, though it would involve you being referred by a medical doctor or a psychologist. Might you be interested?&#39;<br />
<br />
What was there to lose? &#39;Yes why not&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you happy to go to your normal doctor for the referral? If not, I could book you in to see a psychologist we have worked with before who specializes gender dysmorphia. I think you would find her very understanding of your situation. Perhaps I could make an appointment for you?&#39;<br />
<br />
You could not imagine taking your problem to Dr Johnson, who was now nearing retirement and had been your family doctor since childhood. &#39;Yes that sounds good make me an appointment&#39;</p>
