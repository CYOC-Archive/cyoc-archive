<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas was a normal college student, like many before him, he's enroll in Automation and Production Engineering, he was always a calm, intellectual person, he had no religion, but believed in some of thaoism principles, but wasn't a devout follower, as any technophile. He never got laid, or had a second date, but he definitely considered himself straight as he always found himself drooling on big boobs, even though he always failed on getting a relationship beyond the first date, in which they(the girls) usually burned through his money at an alarming rate, he always tried to be a gentleman, the mere thought of overpowering an unwilling female into his will was horrible to bear, that thought usually made him think that he was pending to becoming a queer, but he always resisted said thoughts, as he was virgin and never tasted women like a man would.<br />
It was a cloudy afternoon, Thomas was heading home after class, when he saw Chrissie, the girl he always wished for and tried to hang out, but she refused all his attempts on doing so, she enrolls for the same course as him, at the same class too, fact which only made him wish her more.<br />
He tried talking to her from across the street:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Chrissie!&quot; he waved his hand at her<br />
&quot;Oh, Hi Thomas!&quot; she crossed the street to meet him,&quot;Going home?&quot;, she tilted her head to the left, in a cute way which made him blush slightly<br />
&quot;Ahhh... Yeah, you heading home too?&quot; he couldn't stop himself from looking at her D-Cup, in a way she wouldn't notice, alternating between her green eyes and the cleavage<br />
&quot;yeah, it's very close from here, i'll be going left from here&quot;, she was so beatiful, especially on that nice skin tight leggings, which he could see her purple panties<br />
&quot;let me accompany you to the other side at least, i live here anyway&quot; he said a bit more confident than when he started this conversation<br />
&quot;Fine, so, how you doing? did you finish that homework already?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, was pretty easy, it's just the start of the course anyway, i wasn't expecting anything hard, did you finish too? i can help&quot;, he was very hopeful for a yes at this moment as her boobs jiggled<br />
&quot;No, i finished it too&quot;<br />
Silent ruled for the next two minutes when they reached the end of the sidewalk<br />
&quot;Cya Thomas&quot; she waved at him as she crossed the street to her house, it was small, just like his house was<br />
&quot;Cya tomorrow Chrissie&quot; he responded<br />
Thomas resumed his walk home with the image of those boobs jumping up and down until he got home.<br />
<br />
Upon stepping on his front door, Thomas saw a package, with a strange &quot;TD&quot; emblem on top, he recognized the type of boxing to be a typical technology package, &quot;TransDem Corp?, i thought it was a fake corporation from TF Fiction //yes, i got a bit meta here, you can take this anyway you want//, i guess not.&quot;he took the package under his arms and put on the kitchen table.<br />
It was a nice house, Thomas rented since he moved here from his home-country, Spain, his family kept contact with him through letters, once a month, as most of it's family didn't knew how to use computers,at least enough for a Skype connection.The house had 4 rooms, a Kitchen(complete with an oven, fridge, etc), a Bedroom(with a nice computer, ater all he was a technophile), Living Area(with a big LCD TV he wanted), and Backyard, which he used for laundry.<br />
He worked online, doing websites and maintaining them, it was nice, but he dreamed to be a R&amp;D professional for new processors, but it earned enough for him to pay his rent and all home bills, and it also left enough money for him to buy more gadgets, overall, he was very diligent in dealing with his money, unless he got a date.<br />
He left his backpack on his room, and went to the kitchen where Thomas, filled a mug of coffee and started to unpack the strange package, inside it there was a CD, &quot;Who still uses CDs anyway?&quot; he thought, then something that looked like a sonic screwdriver with a 2-Inch LCD display in the side ,his whovian side yelled in joy at the sight, under it was the manual,&quot;Chronivac 4.0, your transformation software suite for all your needs!&quot; the manual, explained every single detail on how the program worked and what everything did, it had about 170 pages, so he decided to read on a need-to-know basis, and a small piece of paper, fell from it, it was yellowed from time and had a small layer of dust, covering a a small handwritten text, he took the dust away, and it read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Thomas, you may not know me, but i'm the previous owner of this equipment, it helped me change my life for the better, and it choose you as it's next owner, a person who needs it's most, it selected you, what i mean is one day my Chronivac, showed me a window, which displayed the most qualified and deserving person to receive it, strange as it was, it had also ordered his package, flight, everything to be sent to you, this was written as soon as i knew of it's fate, i hope you use it for the best, and, be very, very careful, the Chronivac is very powerful, and it must be handled with care and calm, don't use it with an uncertain as it may be your undoing.<br />

<br />
&quot;Woah, that's from 6 months ago! how long this took to get here?&quot; he thought, &quot;is this thing sentient somehow?&quot;, he was more intrigued now with it than ever, and decided to put the CD in, it installed like any other program, and he was staring at a 3D representation of himself, it was very accurate, it didn't look like a typical 3D model from any game he heard before, it was pinpoint accurate and displayed his characteristics really well, in fact it was so well-defined on the screen that for a moment he thought that his Video Card might die, but to his surprise, it barely showed any activity, either on the processor or the V-Card, &quot;It uses a real good 3D rendering i must say&quot;, as he zoomed in to his face to a point, where he could clearly see a single string of hair from his cheek. After the amazement of the incredible definition on his image on the screen went away, he noticed the other options to his right, it could edit his entire being, things like gender, name, height, strength, weight, complexion, clothing(which had presets, like cowboy, terminator, etc) and many, many more options, and as he slelected parts of his body, like his ear or hands or chest he noticed the options change, proportion, tone, etc, these changes happened only to the part selected.<br />
<br />
Looking at so many options made him wonder, what he could do to assert the functionality of this program? he would definitely need to try something small, something that wouldn't change his life or anything, he thought, as he browsed through the options for mental changes, which included IQ, Cunning, Intelligence and Knowledge, which had a list of everything he knew included, things like: Programming - Amateur, Walking, Talking, Programming - C, Programming - PHP, Man logic, Rationality, Thaoism- Adept, Catholicism- Adept, Shinto- Adept, it had an option to add or remove knowledge, or edit knowledge depth. There was also personality options with presets and &quot;tendencies&quot;, the way chronivac sees personality, and a tab for illness like OCD, ADHD, Schizophrenia, etc.<br />
