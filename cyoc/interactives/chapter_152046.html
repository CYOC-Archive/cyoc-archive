<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say that Leon Talbot had a rough day would be a serious understatement.<br />
Just about everyone who respected and acknowledged him as the werelion king of Moon Lake had called wanting to know his thoughts about the town council&#39;s decision the night before.<br />
This, coupled with worrying about his son Peter and fiance Karen Yuletide in San Diego to see how his future mother-in-law was doing after a serious auto accident, plus the fact that he couldn&#39;t get any work done for Talbot Restorations today to attempt relieving some of his stress, had tensed Leon more than he cared to admit.<br />
His wife Regina however, knew her husband quite well.<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; she began, reaching out to take his paw in hers, for both had resumed their leonine fursonas in the privacy of their home. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked, pushing aside the desert dishes to one side of the dinner table.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; admitted Leon. &quot;At times I realize my father was right. Heavy lies the head that bears the crown.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay dear. I know exactly what you need,&quot; she said, rising from the table.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; he said, looking at her lovely form.<br />
&quot;Come with me,&quot; she requested, urging him up from the table.<br />
<br />
Leon thought Regina would lead him somewhere outside, or better yet their private bedroom, where they could enjoy some quiet intimacy together.<br />
But instead was totally surprised when she led him to the living room.<br />
She paused momentarily to turn on the stereo, then finished her journey to the couch.<br />
Regina sat at one corner of the sofa as soft music began to play. Then motioned for Leon to be next to her.<br />
He started to sit down, but Regina corrected him by indicating that she wanted him to lay across the couch, with his head upon her furry lap.<br />
He laid his cellphone on the coffee table in front of them before complying. Then Regina slowly began to massage his temples with her hands.<br />
&quot;The king is responsible for everyone under him, including me. But as your mate, let alone queen, it is my duty, privilege and honor to see to your needs my love. So just rest as I tend to you.&quot;<br />
A part of Leon still couldn&#39;t help wondering if the evening would turn sexual, for Regina was the love of his life and the one lioness who would ALWAYS have him, no matter what the rest of werelion society demanded of him.<br />
Instead her tender paws stayed between his temples, neck, and shoulders; gently massaging his cares away.<br />
<br />
It was working too.<br />
In the darkness, neither werelion needed light and Leon started feeling himself not only relax, but began to drift off a little too...<br />
Until his cellphone began ringing.<br />
&quot;DAMN IT!&quot; he roared, sitting up and grabbing the unit. There was no way he could ignore the call, especially in case it was Peter or some other important lion business. But if it was another telemarketer...<br />
<br />
Pausing only long enough to not recognize the number calling, Leon said, &quot;Hello!&quot;<br />
&quot;Err, hello,&quot; said the female voice on the other end. &quot;This is the number I was given, considering what time it is. Can I please speak to Leon Talbot.&quot;<br />
&quot;Speaking,&quot; he replied.<br />
&quot;My name is Doctor Moria Alexander of San Diego—&quot;<br />
&quot;Are the Yuletides okay? What about my son?&quot; Leon asked, realizing what the call was probably about.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m on my dinner break at the hospital at the moment, so as far as I know, yes to all three.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Then may I assume...&quot;<br />
&quot;I have to be careful what I say on my end, because there are other <i>people</i> about,&quot; she added, stressing that one word, &quot;but yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;What club?&quot; wondered Leon.<br />
&quot;As a baseball fan, I root for Detroit,&quot; replied Doctor Alexander.<br />
Leon knew she meant weretigress. &quot;The reason I asked my son to reach out to other club members in case he met any on his journey is because the town council here has decided that once they formulate a plan to do so, they&#39;re going to reveal were existence to the world at large.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are they nuts?&quot; asked Alexander.<br />
&quot;That has been questioned. But from what I&#39;ve heard of the meeting, the werefox that proposed the idea was quite persuasive. Something about wanting to do so while we could still control the narrative in our favor.&quot;*<br />
&quot;I saw the news about the situation in Seattle recently,(*2)&quot; replied Alexander.<br />
&quot;Just the latest. There were two closer to home on either side of that,&quot; revealed Leon. (*3) &quot;I can agree that rogues are a serious and legitimate concern, but still...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; conceded Alexander. &quot;But there may be a point to this. It might be better to do so now while we can instead of later. In football, they say the best defense is a good offense.&quot;<br />
&quot;So I&#39;ve heard. While there is no specific time table, once a plan has been prepared and executed, it will only reveal our true existence, not that of Moon Lake as our sanctuary,&quot; added Leon.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good. If it all blows up in their faces, then I&#39;ll still have someplace to come home to, if necessary,&quot; whispered Alexander.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re originally from here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. My medical education was out of state, and then I settled here in San Diego for the professional challenges.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. It would be interesting to converse further when you have the time and can speak freely,&quot; said Leon. &quot;The disadvantage to our way of life is not knowing for sure who, let alone where we all are.&quot;<br />
&quot;I agree. I&#39;ve been alone for so long...&quot; then Alexander caught herself. &quot;That&#39;s something I&#39;d rather not talk about right now, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
&quot;Understood. But if I can ask about Monica Yuletide...&quot;<br />
&quot;Just a second,&quot; said Moria, before looking around to make sure she could not be overheard. Then she told Leon, &quot;I have told your son, her daughter, and her fiance everything I could under the rules and laws of the land.&quot;<br />
&quot;Monica Yuletide is engaged?&quot; asked Leon in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Yes. They didn&#39;t tell you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Guess that was not as important as her actual medical state at the moment.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll save that part for your son and his fiance. Her fiance is nice, but as lost as Karen at the moment,&quot; observed Alexander.<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; agreed Leon.<br />
&quot;Like I told them, my earliest estimate on Monica Yuletide being anywhere close to her old self would be at least a year from now at the outside. Probably later, depending upon her spine and brain exam results after she regains consciousness. But regardless of how good her insurance might be, she&#39;ll have a long road ahead of her on every front imaginable. I assume Mrs. Yuletide doesn&#39;t know about...&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; answered Leon. &quot;Karen&#39;s original plan was to present Peter to her mother at Thanksgiving, so she didn&#39;t know about Monica&#39;s fiance before now either I presume.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not to my knowledge. Look, I&#39;m afraid I have to get back on duty now, but it was quite interesting talking to you and, despite being from a different branch, I look forward to doing so again if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all. You have my number,&quot; said Leon.<br />
&quot;And you mine. Good night,&quot; and with that, Moria Alexander ended the call.<br />
