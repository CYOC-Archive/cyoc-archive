<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff smiled, an overwhelming gratitude engulfing him, almost as thoroughly as the bra cup was hugging his abnormal privates. Aside from the happiness he felt knowing Brianna would help him get the bra into his life, which was to him the clothing equivalent of acquiring a brand new Lamborghini, Jeff had picked up on her slightly flirtatious behavior. The squeeze, coupled with the invitation to hang out for the third day in a row, was a big incentive … however, realistic thoughts came to mind.<br />
<br />
“What about your parents or your brother? I’d have to be super careful with my… I mean, the breast, so that might be annoying for you to deal with.” Brianna nodded, thinking. “True, but… they&#39;ll all be out doing their own things in the afternoon. Mom is going to yoga class and shopping with some girlfriends, and Tim is staying over with a friend until the evening, so if you came by between two forty-five and five o clock, we’d have the house to ourselves. I was supposed to help my dad with getting materials for the deck or something, but I can just say I’m sick.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was taken aback, though not in a bad way. It was more a subtle and sudden surprise. Brianna never struck him as the kind of person to lie to her parents, even if he hadn’t really spoken to her in years. It was unexpected, but… it felt good, hearing that she was willing to break rules for him. It made him feel special, like he really mattered to her. They had opened up to one another yesterday, and she had even kissed his cheek, but that could easily have just been misread. Was she really okay with seeing him again, even though he wasn’t normal ‘down there’? Jeff’s mind raced, focusing on every different aspect of what was going on, when-<br />
<br />
“Hey, you okay?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at Brianna, realizing he had trailed off into deep thought and was gazing at the wall behind her. Chuckling softly, he apologized, at which point she giggled. “I, uh… I felt it jiggle.” Jeff realized Brianna’s hand was still on his breast, which made him laugh nervously, and in turn caused it to jiggle a second time. After getting ahold of themselves, they agreed to the terms: Jeff would split the cost of the bra with Brianna, and they would see each other tomorrow at her house from two forty five to five o clock.<br />
<br />
Brianna gently slid the silken bra cup off of Jeff, and he began to re-equip the old, far less heavenly homemade jockstrap onto his breast. Glancing out of the changing room, Brianna signaled the all clear, and the two exited without anyone noticing. Going back to the store front, where the same large-breasted goth employee was leaning on the counter - as bored and unenthused as ever - Jeff and Brianna split the considerable cost between them. They paid cash, not wanting to leave a paper trail that could tie back to the shop, and left with their wallets almost entirely empty. Jeff was ecstatic, knowing he would be able to enjoy the bra&#39;s divine comfort for the next week. It was the same kind of excited joy as if he had managed to buy the newest gaming console on launch day, but he also felt guilty for Brianna using her money on something that only benefitted him. As he turned to her to try and apologize, she snickered and winked, handing him the bag with the lacy pink purchase in it.“Not one word. It was my treat.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s heart fluttered, and it was all he could do not to fawn over her kindness any more than a wide smile.<br />
<br />
The next day came, and Jeff made sure any chores and homework were done early, an effort his mother noticed. Pleased and impressed by his diligence, she complimented him and told him to enjoy his day with ‘that polite young lady’, guessing correctly the cause of her son’s improved attitude. In a great mood and feeling very good about where things were going, he made his way over to Brianna’s house at two forty-five as planned, his breast packed neatly and comfortably away in the new bra cup. The expensive materials it was sewn out of had made cutting and stitching it into a proper cup much trickier than with his mom’s bra (which she thankfully hadn’t noticed was missing), but the trade-off was well worth it. The elasticity, grip, and overall manner that it let his breast breathe and rest in luxurious snugness, was worth every penny of the price.<br />
<br />
Jeff arrived at Brianna’s house, the short walk feeling like an eternity of travel, an intense mix of excitement and nervousness pumping through his veins. He rang the doorbell, and Brianna answered it with an eager smile. After some light banter and small talk in the lobby, they moved downstairs to the Ferguson&#39;s basement, where the ping pong table was ready, the paddles laid out in advance. “You feel like playing best of three?”, she asked.<br />
<br />
Desperate to defuse any tension, Jeff replied with the first joke that came to his mind. “How about best of eleven?”<br />
<br />
Brianna, however, didn’t laugh. Instead, she narrowed her eyes, a competitive smirk appearing. “Oh, you’re on.” Jeff almost regretted what he had said, but he noted the pure glee of Brianna’s reaction. From what he remembered her telling him, she rarely got an opportunity to actually play competitively against anyone. For her, his joking remark was a welcome opportunity for some serious play.<br />
<br />
The next half hour was a hectic but ultimately fun mix of running, swinging, and the unmistakable “tic-tac-tic-tac” of the small plastic ball smacking between the opposite sides of the tiny, mock tennis court. It wasn’t until Jeff ultimately lost, six to four, that any sense of discomfort began to occur around his breast.  The soft, satiny fabric was gentle and lovingly cupped the large mass, with the lace providing a wispy soft structure against his thighs. As feminine as it was, Jeff was more than pleased with the bra, and the quality of the upgrade over his old makeshift cup was immensely notable.<br />
<br />
However, while his breast remained comfortable and snug, Jeff could feel that the rest of his body - understandably - was sore, with sweat dripping down every which way. A quick glance at Brianna told Jeff she was in a similar situation. Her breathing was fast, and she was repeatedly wiping her brow, the signs of physical exertion and fatigue all too clear. For the next few minutes, they rested, sitting next to one another on the nearby sofa, panting gently, and collecting themselves in silence.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until Jeff was about to offer to go upstairs and find them drinks, that Brianna spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Um... hey... J-Jeff, I-I was wondering...”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at her, nervousness and uncertainty churning in his stomach. Had he done something wrong? Was she annoyed? Should he have offered to get them drinks sooner?<br />
<br />
As if reading his mind, Brianna tacked on: “Oh, it’s nothing... nothing bad, just... um...”<br />
<br />
A full fifteen seconds of silence followed, when Brianna blurted out her next sentence, making direct eye contact, and holding it, her voice wavering unevenly with stress.<br />
<br />
“D—Do you, UM... want to...  take a shower with me? Uh... HAHA, like... YEAH. So... COOL?!”</p>
