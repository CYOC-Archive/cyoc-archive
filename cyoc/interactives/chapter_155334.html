<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Thanksgiving in Animalia tended to be a communal holiday, Dino City was a bit different. The City Hall there was far smaller and did not have the large open space that was available for a dining area for large numbers of people to allow for it. The smaller population also drove less of a need for a large feast. Though, given the size of many Dinotopians the amount of food eaten was still fairly high and the fact that all Dinotopians were converted humans made the difference in the way dinner was handled acceptable to them. That then allowed for more family dinners that could be more supportive for all of them, and some were bigger than others.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you helped get this thief out of prison?&quot; Tyra asked to Heather as they sat down to dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the jail... and I was thinking it would be something like what you did with me,&quot; Heather offered, &quot;give her a start at a new life... and... well, some of Animalia&#39;s more unique takes on crime and punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyra raised on brow ridge as she looked to Heather and then over to Rex. Her husband gave a shrug and passed out some various slices of meat over to the others that were gathered around the table. Most of it was pork steaks made from one of the hogs that Tyra had killed during her hunting adventure, but there was some turkey that was there to and the scent of the warm meat made her mouth water.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think it&#39;s actually a good thing,&quot; Jeremy commented and rubbed the back of Heather&#39;s hand, &quot;it shows how far she&#39;s come and who she really is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Tyra commented, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t see Heather playfully embarrassing this thief...&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather gave a slight shudder, remembering what happened when she&#39;d met what her grandmother became as the last part of her own &quot;punishment&quot; for her actions. It was something that she&#39;d never seen her grandmother doing at the time, as at the time she&#39;d seen her grandmother as a frail and elderly woman, not as the vivacious female Syntixisaurus that she&#39;d become. The two had gotten more used to each other, particularly as Heather could the areas where Tyra wasn&#39;t that different from who she was before. At the same time there was also the occasional instances in which the two found themselves bonding in a way they&#39;d never had before. Heather having Jeremy and Tyra having Rex was one of those things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I wasn&#39;t thinking on embarrassing her,&quot; Heather answered as she slid her knife in a back and forth motion through the meat on her plate, &quot;just give her the sense that they&#39;ll give her forgiveness and a second chance in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a bad thing,&quot; Rex agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see Sophie?&quot; Jeremy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;She had school when I was in Animalia and I couldn&#39;t stay that long,&quot; Heather commented, &quot;but I&#39;d think that Mercy will have plenty to be thankful for... all things considered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say we all do,&quot; Rex commented softly.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
A house or two over at the Thomas household was enjoying their own dinner, though the two Brachiosaur Dinotopians had more enjoyed a leafy dinner of lettuce, carrots, peas, cranberry, pumpkin pie, and some of the other traditional vegetable/fruit dishes that went with Thanksgiving. They&#39;d enjoyed it and the success that they&#39;d had with Dino City opening and the things that had come along with it. Despite the fact that Andrew had never really held any job in the scientific arena before, he&#39;d actually gotten some work periodically helping Rex with some of the educational programs that Rex worked with at the state park that Dino City was built near. Much of it actually helping demonstrate the movements of the dinosaurs that had left the trackway there at the Texas State park, even if Tyrannosaurus and Brachiosaurus were not the actual animals from the trackway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think your grandmother is starting to catch on to the holiday,&quot; Andrew commented to his bandmate as the pair cleaned up after dinner. Jen brought the plates and dishes to him and he washed them in the sink, &quot;would... would it be appropriate to invite her to Thanksgiving sometime... or... would that be improper?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think she would mind the invitation,&quot; Jen commented as they thought back to a phone call that she&#39;d made, essentially providing a bit of an update on things and how they stood between her and Andrew and their lives. It was something that took a bit of work, even the time differences between Texas and Japan, but they&#39;d managed to schedule it so that they weren&#39;t getting themselves up too early or disturbing Jen&#39;s grandmother&#39;s sleep. &quot;Though... given her age... I&#39;m not sure she&#39;d actually make the trip. It would actually be easier for us to go visit her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And would there be a holiday that would be appropriate?&quot; Andrew wondered as he turned his head to look to her.<br />
<br />
Jen remained attractive and seemed a bit more muscular than when she first converted and they&#39;d begun seeing each other. And while he&#39;d had some relations with some of the other early Dinotopians, Jen was still different in many ways. He&#39;d never actually seen himself ever being in love with someone from Japan, but here they were, and Jen still struck him as the only one for him. Andrew also felt like he&#39;d been learning a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;New Years might be a good time for that,&quot; Jen commented as she handed Andrew the last of the dishes that would need washing.<br />
<br />
Andrew accepted it and set it under the faucet to rinse  and then set it down in the soapy water to soak. He nodded his head up and down as he did so and then turned back to face Jen, whom he found smiling to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;January first?&quot; Andrew wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or the lunar new year,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;both could work... and my family would be eager to meet you in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would we...?&quot; Andrew began and lifted his eyes a little to look up to the ceiling above him. He then raised one arm to point to the ceiling, which made Jen chuckle a little bit, but it was a serious point. A lot of the reasoning behind Dino City was to build things to scale to himself and other Dinotopians. Much of Animalia was bigger and more comfortable for larger Animalians, but nearly all of them were modern animals that were substantially smaller than most Dinosaurs. As such, Andrew as the tallest Dinotopian had dealt with low ceilings the most while they&#39;d all been in Animalia. Dino City at least offered buildings of sufficient height for him and Jen to stand erect without worrying about hitting their heads on ceilings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly...&quot; Jen said slowly, &quot;but the man who&#39;s helped me gain my confidence would be able to rough it out for a day or two... Especially when I&#39;m also sure that you will be well received.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Andrew asked, his voice sounding hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if not... that wouldn&#39;t change how I feel, Andrew Thomas,&quot; Jen gave a smile and came close enough to hug him, &quot;and you should know that I love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for that, I am most thankful,&quot; Andrew answered with a smile and kissed her.</p>
