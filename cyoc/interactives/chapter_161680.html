<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gothica shocked at the sight before but still somewhat aroused by it, bit her lower lip as she moved over to a console to type in a few commands.<br />
<br />
Terra was still recovering from her exhaustion wasn&#39;t able to fully understand what was going on around her as she grumbled, the quality of her voice changing as her neck thickened atop her now-quadrupedal torso.<br />
<br />
She felt her neck slowly shrinking as if it as more like an erect cock that was becoming softer as she trotted into a chamber, her hands and feet thudding against the floor, belly swaying beneath her slightly full of her own cum. Her eyes lit up as she spotted what seemed to be some kind of bodysuit, but she noticed it was sealed in a glass enclosure. Her brow furrowed. There didn&#39;t appear to be any way to access it. The room was filled with what looked like scanners and control consoles, with numerous sliding hatches located on the machines in the room. She glanced up to see some mechanical arms hanging dormant from the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Gothica, however, had a different idea for what she had in mind as she looked over the process required for the Dorse transformation and wanted to make it somewhat more &quot;permanent&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once Terra was inside the room, one of the arms descended and thrust towards her, a glassy mechanical eye at its tip. She flinched, but it merely brushed her naked body with a scanning beam, whirring around her to take in her whole form. <br />
<br />
One of the monitors where Gothica was standing came to life and began displaying data in a scroll of text and numbers, all of which was completely foreign to her. It finally paused, allowing her to read it.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
LOCKS ENGAGED<br />
SPECIMEN FOUND: HUMAN (?)<br />
RELEASE CONDITIONS NOT MET<br />
DORSE CONVERSION ACCEPTANCE WITHIN PARAMETERS<br />
COMMIT? Y/N<br />
+++<br />
<br />
As she finished reading the list, Gothica thought to herself, &quot;So if I put on that on all those programs will start.&quot; The thought of doing so made her feel...<br />
<br />
Gothica wasn&#39;t sure what it meant, but she was savvy enough to understand that the bodysuit would only be released for the right specimen. She didn&#39;t know what a &quot;Dorse&quot; was, but she was willing to give it a try as she was curious what the only piece of attire that seemed designed for this new form would look like or do. <br />
<br />
She pressed the button and a panel appeared before Terra with a large button she had to press it as if showing that she agreed to further testing. Grunting with the effort, she clomped one stubby hand on the &quot;yes&quot; option.<br />
<br />
The other machines in the room came to life. A hatch opened up from the floor, unveiling a raised platform with four injector cuffs on it. Terra wasn&#39;t sure what it would do, but she assumed she would have to step into the cuffs to have them do their work. One of the machines opened up, producing what looked to be a set of milkers and a large vacuum-like chamber. Terra had never seen a device like this in person before but she had seen a few erotic videos to know what they were used for, and she was curious. A third machine unfolded an arm with an extremely large tapered plug at the tip, already glossy with lube. Terra blushed angrily. <br />
<br />
Gothica looked in amazement at the sight before her feeling a sudden wetness in her pants &quot;What the hell was the buttplug for?<br />
She realized that the machines were waiting for her to make a choice.<br />
<br />
Terra stared at the vacuum-like tubes, trying to understand the purpose behind them. She tried to think of all the reasons a person would want to use them but couldn&#39;t think of even one. While such a filthy thing would feel amazing in her mouth, she thought about how it smelt and become curious.<br />
<br />
She made a puzzled and confused face while smelling the thing. She leaned in slowly and breathed in taking a deep breath through her nostrils. What she smelt surprised her. It smells not only like some sort of a plastic or rubber-like tube or champer she expected, but something sweet that caused her nose tingle. She can&#39;t for the life of her place what that smell was. Terra decides to lean in closer to get a better whiff. This time the tingle was much, much stronger.<br />
<br />
She slowly curled her lips and gently stuck her long tongue out into the tube getting a taste of the somewhat pearly substance that it seemed to be coated in before giving it a soft suck. Does this have.... a flavour? This caught her by surprise. She wanted, no, needed to find out what it is! Now slightly desperate she began to suck heavily pushing her face into the tube to get more of it as it slowly but easily stretched around her already somewhat elongated face.<br />
<br />
The taste felt stronger rather than fading away. This caused her to suck even harder shoving more of her face into it till it reached her nostrils. Two robotic arms reached out while Terra was distracted and strapped something to the ends around her head. She now felt the tube was slowly starting to expand outwards and elongate in length before a soft sucking sensation could be felt upon her face while her lips seemed to become plumper and be pulled further into the chamber causing the flavour to explode against her tongue and down her throat. &quot;So good. What is it? I need more!&quot; This was the only thought going through her head at this point.<br />
<br />
Her cock was now rock hard. Her nipples erect like diamonds and both pressing hard against the ground only excited her to the point that she never noticed her changes. As it sucked, the shape of her face began to elongate further. Slowly at first but picking up speed the more it sucked until finally, her face was longer than before. <br />
<br />
Next was her neck. Veins made themselves noticeable as the first sign. Then her neck began to slowly shrink. now looking more like a swollen erect penis than a neck. Once it was at a more normalized size although still stretched out the tube attached to her face started to pump in pink fluid causing the changes to become semi-permanent. At the same time, Terra figured out the flavour. Semen! It tastes just like semen! She was so happy and proud she neither noticed nor cares about the changes.<br />
<br />
Gothica could barely contain herself as she rubbed herself furiously wanting to get into the chamber and have some changes done to ber or even try out Terra&#39;s new form only for Terra to notice her.</p>
