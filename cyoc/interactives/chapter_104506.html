<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even as the curse quickly changed the secretly gay Allen into the straight Youth Minstry leader Lennard, it would soon get its hooks into the unsuspecting Danielle. While she&#39;d been the former Allen&#39;s confidant, the young woman had a secret of her own. She was, in fact, a lesbian. Likely that&#39;s why the two of them got along so well.<br />
<br />
Dani, she&#39;d like to be called, realized that she was attracted to girls a few years ago, during a church-sponsored camping trip. It had been hard to deny once she&#39;d shared the showers with her fellow campers. However, Dani knew that such thoughts were most definitely frowned upon by the rest of the community she was a part of. That didn&#39;t stop her from exploring her new interests, but she managed to play it cool. Not too hard when she wasn&#39;t a part of any of the other high school cliques.<br />
<br />
Her looks probably helped in keeping her secret, as she was a fairlu plain looking girl in her late teens that didn&#39;t attract much attention from the boys. She didn&#39;t dress too differently from the other girls, perhaps favoring jeans and t-shirts a lot more than skirts and blouses. That she also spent time hanging out with Allen was another bit of convenient cover, one that was starting to weigh on her conscience. Perhaps that&#39;s why she was standing a little closer to the boys when the call for prayers went out.<br />
<br />
She had been close enough to hear the tail end of that basketballer Ryan&#39;s prayer and his crack about being &#39;homo free&#39;. It upset her, but Dani knew she couldn&#39;t blow her cover over it. Turning back to her own circle, she was happy to see that Suzy was next to her today. She&#39;d had a crush on the cheerleader, always admiring her long athletic legs and tight ass. But her fear of exposure had always kept her from acting on those feeling, not mention she didn&#39;t exactly run in the same social circles outside of this youth ministry,<br />
<br />
But the usual rush of pleasure she got from being this close to her crush seemed a bit muted today, as if some long quiet part of her mind was telling it was wrong to feel such things about a fellow Christian woman. That feeling of wrongness caused her look down at the ground, and somehow lose herself in the prayers of the others. Perhaps that&#39;s why she failed to notice the changes starting to occur to her clothes.<br />
<br />
The beat-up sneakers she was wearing had shifted from dirty white to shiny black leather, even as the laces were receding to reveal more of her feet. The soles of the shoes thinned considerable, except at the back where the rubber hardened into two-inch high heels. The changes to her footwear caused the young woman to shift into a straighter and taller posture, also causing her ass and chest to stick out a bit more. <br />
<br />
The changes continued to work their way over her lower half, as the legs of her jeans fused together, and began to crawl up her legs. As they shifted upwards and became a skirt that hung just above the knee, the material changed from denim to wool, the blue fading into a solid grey.  <br />
<br />
Now revealed to the air, her calves began to gain a muscle tone not too dissimilar from that of Suzy&#39;s, while under the skirt, her thighs thickened along with a widening of her hips.  Likewise, her legs grew longer overall, increasing her height by a few inches. Meanwhile, memories of cheerleading practice began to seep into a increasingly  confused Dani&#39;s memories. Hadn&#39;t she been on the squad since sophmore year? She shook her head a bit, not sure why she&#39;d forgotten such a thing. After all, she&#39;d joined because of her best friend Suzy.<br />
<br />
Having done its work on her lower half, the power of the curse began to change her torso.  Her plain black t-shirt suddenly ripped down the center, revealing the modest blue sports bra she&#39;d been wearing. The two halves of the t-shirt shifted from dull cotton to smooth white silk as a line of buttons appeared down the left side of the tear. The sports bra likewise was altered into something more lacy and white, even the breasts it held began growing in size, going from modest b-cups to bouncy d-cups. An invisible force began to pull to the two halves of the developing blouse closed, as its buttons slipped into their appropriate holes. That it concealed her new larger cleavage seemed appropriate to Dani, as she didn&#39;t want to tempt anyone down a sinful path.  <br />
<br />
The short sleeves of the former t-shirt began sliding down Dani&#39;s arms, which had gained a muscle tone similar to her legs, as she needed that strength for the more complex routines of the cheerleading squad. As a wide collar grew in around her more delicate neck with an accompanying silver cross to pin it closed, the sleeves of the blouse gained cuffs that settled around her forearms.<br />
<br />
Now that most of her body had been changed, the curse went back to work Dani&#39;s mind. Some part of her knew something was wrong, but it was being overwhelmed by new memories, first of daily cheerleading practice, then her regular attendance of church. That camping trip where she&#39;d discovered her attraction to girls was rapidly fading away, being replaced with  memories of her pledging herself fully to living a proper Christian life. That meant keeping herself pure for her future husband, and making sure she was ready to be his full partner in everything.<br />
<br />
The new Danielle&#39;s, as Dani was hardly a proper Christian name, interests in things that didn&#39;t fall into that line of thinking fell to wayside. She&#39;d gotten decent grades before, but now the cheerleader had graduated as a member of the honor roll. Her high grades and her strong faith had naturally led to her attendance of the local Christian college. But she hadn&#39;t neglected her other responsibilities, remaining an active member of her church, joining its Youth Ministry. It was in course of her duties in the latter that she met him. Lennard was only a few years older than her, but that wasn&#39;t too much of an issue. After all, he was one of the leaders of the Youth Minstry, as well as the church band, whose dedication to the faith and the church was unquestionable. She knew that their growing love for one another was righteous in the eyes of the Lord.<br />
<br />
As her new memories solidified themselves, the final changes to her appearance began to take hold. Her dull brown hair grew out past her shoulders, gaining body and shine as it ties itself into a loose ponytail. Her eyes watered slightly as their color shifted from plain brown to dazzling blue-green. Her teeth whitened and straightened into a perfect smile, as her cheekbones moved up slightly, Her long nose shaved itself down, as her thin lips plumped up. A small hits of makeup made themselves known on her face, even as simple diamond-stud earrings popped into existence, as she was very modest in her accessories, vanity being a sin. Her hands grew more delicate, while a silver ring similar to the one that Lennard wore wrapped itself around her left ring finger. <br />
<br />
As she finished up leading her girls in prayer expertly, the college senior Danielle turned towards her approaching fiancé. She smiled warmly as he took her hand and kissed on the cheek. She blushed happily, confident in her faith and her future with Lennard.</p>
