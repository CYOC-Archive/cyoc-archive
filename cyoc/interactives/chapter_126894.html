<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I can&#39;t believe they actually used the puppy dog pout,&quot; Katie laughed. Kellie grinned as the two teens hung out in Katies room. &quot;Ugh tell me about it. That&#39;s my thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
While the two teens weren&#39;t exactly thrilled with the idea of going to a jazz club, they couldn&#39;t help but give in to their parents demands. The fact that they seemed to be out of trouble now gave them hope of things going back to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would of been fun goimg to Comic con though,&quot;  Katie sighed. &quot;We probably would of had more of a chance to have fun with the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellies eyes lit up as a thought crossed her mind. &quot;Who says that the ring can&#39;t go,&quot; she said. Katie gave her qiflfriend a quizical look. &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay hear me out,&quot; Kellie started. &quot;I rhink we cam safely say we trust oir friends at this point right?&quot; Katie nodded, still curious as to where Kellie was leading her. &quot;What if we let them borrow the ring for the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katies jaw dropped as she stared at Kellie. &quot;Are you nuts!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Do you have any idea how bad things could go. What if they lose the ring. What if they won&#39;t give it back. What if they decide to use it on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve thought about that,&quot; Kellie stated. &quot;We explain the rules to them and make them promise not to use the ring on anyone we know. That way we should be okay and they would be too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie rubbed her chin as she thought things over. It was risk ttusting the girls with that much power. Katie worried about wjat could happen of they somehow aged themselves back into their fifties. Would they remember their old lives? Would they be angry with Katie and Kellie and take revenge?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not sure,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean i trust them, we&#39;ve been through so much in the last couple of weeks. What if the ring messes things up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie scratched jer head as she thought. Katie brought up a good point. She hadn&#39;t thought about what would happen if the girls found out about their old lives. Suddenly an idea came to her head causing her to leep to her feet. &quot;I&#39;ve got it!&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she rubbed her hands together. &quot;Look the ring seems to work pretty well for us right? Katie nodded. &quot;What if we wish some blocks onto the ring. Kind of like putting parental locks on a computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm I think that could work,&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she picked up her phone. &quot;Okay heres the deal. You put the blocks on the ring while i call them. Lets have them stop by tomorrow morning so we can pass the ring off.&quot; Katie nodded in agreement as Kellie began calling her friends.<br />
<br />
It was a beautiful Saturday morning as Katie went about picking a dress for the jazz club that evening. Kellie had asked her friends to stop by before they went to Comic con that day. Amazingly all of their friends were going. Samantha had invited Mike while Mary Elise was going with Sebastian. Even Mika and Claudia were going but there was a catch to the triple date they were going on. Claudia&#39;s father insisted on driving them all their and then waiting for the dau to finish. If he didn&#39;t drive the group then Claudia and Mika wouldnt be able to go. Reluctantly the girls all agreed and now found themselves crammed into Toms minivan.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door brought alerted Katie that Kellie had arrived. &quot;Katie,&quot; Lisa called. &quot;Kellies here to see you.&quot; Bounding down the stairs Katie could see her girlfriend wasnt yet dressed for the club. Maggie had done her hair, which looked beautiful, but she had yet to find a dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow your hair looks great,&quot; Katie said causing Kellie to blushed slightly. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said. &quot;Any idea when Claudia and the others are stopping by?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Katie could answer a minvan pulled into the driveway. Claudia, Mika, Mary Elise and Samantha now ran towards the front door as Tom slowly exited the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Kellie your hair looks fantastic,&quot; Mika stated. Kellie smiled broadly thanking her for the compliment. Glancing at the others Kellies jaw dropped as she saw Mary Elise. The young red head was dressed as Black Widow for comic con. The outfit she wore enhanced the girls natural beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap Mary you look fantastic,&quot; she exclaimed. Mary Elise blushed and thanked Kellie for the comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of wish you said you dressing up though,&quot; Mika said. &quot;Feel kinda lame not goimg in a costume.&quot; The others nodded and began to talk about how good Mary Elise looked and how they wished they too thought of dressing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay listen,&quot; Katie stated bringimg the grpup back to attention. &quot;Kellie told you we would let you borrow the ring for the day right?&quot; The girls nodded as Katie took a deep breath. &quot;Okay there are three rules you need to follow while useing the ring okay. First you can&#39;t change someone in the group without their permission got it.&quot; The girls nodded in understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Second, altering someones parent is forbidden. Trust me on this things can get awkward if you try.&quot; The girls gave Katie a curious look before nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally the last rule,&quot; she said. &quot;If things get roo out of control. You must wish everyrhing back to the way it was okay?&quot; The girls nodded anxiously as the looked at Katies ring. <br />
<br />
&quot;Katie can i talk to you real quick,&quot; Kellie asked. Katie nodded as the two teens stepped away from the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you put the blocks in,&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
Katie nodded. &quot;Yea dont worry,&quot; she said. &quot;I made it so they wont be able to wish back their old lives. They wont be able to affect us either, ive made it so the ring will only give them limited options that will keep things from getting too out of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your sure it will work?&quot; Kellie asked. Katie nodded as she looked at the ring. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it will,&quot; Katie said. &quot;When i put the blocks in placr the ring seemed to tell me that they wont be able to do the same things we can. Its weird but i seemed to be able to talk with it. It will only use some of its power with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Satisfied Kellie smiled as the girls returned to their friends. &quot;Sorry just needed to ask Katie a question,&quot; she said. &quot;So anyone have any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
No one said a word as they now looked at the ring. &quot;Wow this is going to be wild,&quot; Samatha gasped. &quot;Thanks for letting us try it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish my dad wasnt tagging along,&quot; Claudia groaned. Turning back towards the car she could see her giant of a father looking at her. &quot;Daddy,&quot; she called. &quot;You know its probably going to be really boring you don&#39;t need to wait for us all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia,&quot; Tom called. &quot;On my last deployment I was forced to take cover in an open sewer line for six hours to avoid mortar fire. That six hours. Waist deep. In human excrement. I think i can handle a little boredom&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew DADDY...TMI!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom snickered as Claudia tried to shake that image from her head. Her friends now also tried to suppress giggles as they saw Claudia blush in slight embarassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thats about all i have to say,&quot; Katie said trying to get everyone to focus. &quot;Any questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think were good,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Thanks again for letting us borrow this it should be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise we&#39;ll keep it safe,&quot; Mika added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Katie,&quot; Mary Elise said. &quot;We&#39;ll be responsibke with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can count on us Katie,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;Oh and by the way have fun tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she looked out at her friends. This was a huge step she was taking but lookimg at the girls in front of her she trusted them completely. Smilimg she took the ring and hamded it to....</p>
