<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p> Johnathan Kibbutz took off his regular clothes and put them at the closet. At least he would start his 
first sting operation. He would pose as a addicted hobo and gather info on the local meth market. His new name 
would be Johnny Stone. He gave a little smile, Stone the stoner, no one could say that the force hasn´t any 
sense of humor. The cover for the Stone identity was that he was a high school dropout that run away from home 
and become a meth addict, traveling around making small thefts to fund his addiction. All his clothes were a 
mess, he hasn´t shaved or even bathed in the last few days. </p>
<p> When Johnny finished changing into the cover attire, he suddenly felt dizzy, just how he felt when poor 
Martha tried to help him with that freak ring. The dizziness quickly went away and Johnny reached for the 
mirror to check himself. No magical change in his appearance, it was just himself dirty and dressed like he 
lived on the streets.</p>  

<p> " I guess that there is no help. I am well feed and a health guy, it will took a while to really look the 
part, but for now the fact that i don´t attract a lot of attention looking like a cop, ain´t very bad." </p> 

<p>But as he looked into his reflect image, Johnny sensed that inside something was different. He felt like a 
loser, not like a cop. He felt shame for what he had became and that he failed his family. But why he would 
feel like that ? He was a undercover cop, helping taking crooks from the streets, he should be proud. But the 
alien feeling of failing to society embraced him as he exited the room to present himself to the Captain. </p>

<p>" Very well officer Kibbutz, or should i call you Mr. Stone ? I didn´t thought you had that into yourself, 
but even your eyes look like the eyes of those pieces of trash. If i didn´t know better i would thought that 
you had meth into there. " Said the captain congratulating Johnny.</p>

<p> He gave a little smile, but quickly resumed the broken look. He even started sweating when the captain 
joked about being suspicious of him. Why he was nervous like that ? He didn´t done anything wrong. </p>

<p>The captain gave Johnny a bit of money and some final instructions about their next meeting, Johnny became 
bored. He already had the money, he wanted to get to the streets fast. Johnny meet others undercover cops who 
where to present him as a potential new client to the local dealers, his act was perfect and the dealers 
bought the cover and over the next days he rapidly became a regular. But without Johnny knowing, the Mezmer 
ring was making his Stoner cover more than believable, Johnny didn´t  notice that he passed several days 
bathless or lack of grooming without even blinking. He didn´t really consumed the meth he was buying, but the 
Stoner mindset was turning real. His personal hygiene got poorly, his vocabulary got rough and he was even 
trouble making the math of his daily reports of how much he was spending. His sense of right and wrong were 
changing, he got really close of the dealers and others addicts (there was even a junkie chick that was making 
he forget about Martha) and became resentful of others cops that could live a good life when he had to mix 
himself with the trash. </p>

<p> Two months after he got deep undercover, he was already really addicted to meth and was lying in his 
reports to his superiors. Johnny could not believe how fast thing got so wrong. He wanted to get out and go 
back to his normal life, but he didn´t felt like a cop anymore. He even started to think of himself as if he 
was truly Johnny Stone, and the cops made some mistake of mixed identities with a doppleganger called 
Johnathan Kibbutz, but he had all Johnathan memories, he was Johnathan Kibbutz, but his mentality was of John 
Stone. He even robbed a liquor store to pay his meth debts. His life became hell. Eventually the captain 
discovered his lies and he got arrested and expelled from the police force. When they took his clothes and the 
cover ended officially, his mindset was restored, but it was too late and another tale. </p></p>
