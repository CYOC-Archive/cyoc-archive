<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim could still hear the fight going on between Abby and Sandra outside the cave. Periodically one or the other landed hard, and much of the ground shook due to their massive sizes. Jim could even see some bits of dust fall down from the roof of the cave as he stood holding the box of vials before the two griffons that had sneaked into the cave while Sandra and Abby battled outside. The griffons were clearly scared of Sandra and or what she might bring about, and Jim had actually come to agree that Sandra had been willing to use force against him and then outright attacked Abby after the two of them had gone through with their part of the deal to balance each other out. From that point of view, Jim figured that Sandra had gone back on her agreement in the deal, but that still left Abby fighting for her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim... Jim... I need help!&quot; he heard Abby&#39;s voice call out. It was tinged with fear and what Jim didn&#39;t know was that the head that was talking was her angry head. Sandra was proving to be enough of a problem for her that even the heads that had been more interested in the deal and not as much the &quot;true&quot; Abby as far as Jim was concerned were willing to admit needing help.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fairies can help if you become a child,&quot; Junn insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can they stop Sandra? Turn her back or if need be... kill her?&quot; Jim asked.<br />
<br />
He watched as both griffons looked to something and then answered back with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Junn sighed slowly, &quot;her abilities as a dragon make her resistant to even fairy magic, and would need to willingly accept such a transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they are too small to have the power to kill her,&quot; Bechana added, &quot;but if your girlfriend&#39;s mind wishes to be human, your wish could allow for her to be human again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And at Sandra&#39;s mercy,&quot; Jim said slowly, &quot;I can agree that Sandra is a threat... a danger... and from what she&#39;s said about you... I can understand your fear of her, as she doesn&#39;t like you and only quit her pursuit because catching you was too hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why we don&#39;t want her gaining more power,&quot; Junn said slowly, &quot;My mate... Bechana and my eggs will hatch in a month or so. If Sandra is alone, she will be less of a threat than if she has friends or children of her own... They will come after us or inspire human hunters to come after us in force.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So your answer is to hide?&quot; Jim shot at him, &quot;my girlfriend did what she did to save my life and was quite willing to give up a lot if it meant freeing me. Sandra is a threat and a danger, yes, but she&#39;s desperate for a mate and has already had conflicts with the military. You want to destroy the box? Fine. But I&#39;m not leaving my girlfriend at the mercy of a beast who will only kill her the instant she becomes human... and will still pose a threat to everything...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he set the box down at Bechana&#39;s taloned front feet, but kept the refilled dragon and hydra vials in his hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;No one will be safe so long as Sandra lives and can threaten anyone,&quot; Jim said to them and drank both vials at the same time, &quot;Abby and I will put a stop to her once and for all. We will not be like Sandra. We will put a stop to her and will protect you from any threat, and I promise you that Abby and I won&#39;t be a threat to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim then slowly began to make his way toward the mouth of the cave. He could feel the contents of the vials entering his system and he didn&#39;t know how long he would have until he would be too big to stay in the cave. He knew he didn&#39;t have much choice in the matter when the griffon&#39;s reported that the fairies could only affect Sandra if she was willing, and since Sandra had already stated her intention of staying as she was, that wouldn&#39;t work for Sandra. In theory it MIGHT work with Abby, but that wasn&#39;t likely. While Jim know that Abby&#39;s central head only wanted to be a hydra long enough to defeat Sandra and then return to human form and that her intelligent head might be willing to go along with it if Sandra wasn&#39;t a threat. Abby&#39;s lustful head might go along with it if Jim offered to have a nonstop sex marathon with Abby after her returning to human form, but Abby&#39;s ambitious, angry, surly, and feral heads enjoyed the power they&#39;d gained and would have a 4-3 advantage over what Jim saw as the true Abby, and that assumed her lustful head sided with Abby and her intelligent head. The lustful head might go along with the others for some other kinky reason and make it a 5-2 vote in favor of staying a hydra/dragon hybrid. That mean that the fairy magic wouldn&#39;t affect Abby either, and no matter what he thought of Sandra, he wasn&#39;t going to leave Abby alone.<br />
<br />
The two griffons watched as Jim made his way forward. He could still hear the battle going as Abby and Sandra wrestled, flew, bit and breathed fire, ice, or acid on each other, but there was yet no full advantage, but he would turn that tide. He would turn the tide in Abby&#39;s favor and they would change the stories people told about the &quot;dragon in the mountains.&quot; He and Abby would be protectors, and as long black claws burst from his finger tips, he made his way forward. His advance was soon stopped he suddenly felt his body begin to grow larger in all directions, pushing against his clothing and his shoes. He couldn&#39;t continue until he was freed of the clothes that confined him.<br />
<br />
The first to fall apart under the strain of his growing body was his shoes as his feet burst through them, looking very much like they were the feet of a Tyrannosaurus Rex rather than a human. However, the scales on his feet weren&#39;t black like Sandra&#39;s or slate gray the way Abby&#39;s were. They were a brilliant sapphire blue that seemed to even glow with a great deal of inner light. These scales continued to cover him as Jim fell down into a quadrupedal stance and with his arms, now forelegs  being long enough to keep his spine straight. Next to fail was his shirt. His growing muscle in his shoulders and chest were straining all the seams, and it was growing tight on him, but what finally ripped it off of his growing body was the bursting forth of two draconic wings, as with the rest of him, was a sapphire blue in color, but the membranes between his wing bones were actually a lighter shade of blue than the rest of him. Bechana even noticed that Jim&#39;s belly scales  on his chest and belly were also a slightly lighter shade of blue than the rest of him. Jim hesitantly flapped his new wings to test the wing muscles, and gained some almost immediate lift into the air, even in the cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels good... flying,&quot; Jim thought as his pants and underwear were torn apart by his growing size and lengthening of a blue scaled tail, and then shouted in a voice that was far deeper than he expected, &quot;Hang on Abby! I&#39;m coming!&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice alerted both combatants but the first to appear at the cave entrance was Sandra who eyed Jim as he landed and continued to grow in size. In fact, by now, he had to fold his wings to keep them from brushing the ceiling of the cave. Sandra couldn&#39;t help but smile at the sight, as Jim was making a rather marvelous looking creature with his blue scales and golden slit like eyes. He&#39;d lost his hair, but then Sandra had lost hers when she first became a dragon and she didn&#39;t miss her hair, as a dragon, or a dragon/hydra hybrid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking wonderful, my mate,&quot; Sandra smiled, &quot;Come to me and let me show you that I am the superior mate... the superior dragon... the superior queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pure fury filled Jim as his neck began to push forward and lengthen while a blue scaled muzzle pushed out from his face. He had only two backward facing horns on his head, but Jim didn&#39;t care. Abby had made a deal with Sandra to save him and sacrificed so much of herself to save him, and all Sandra did repay what should have been seen as an act of kindness and generosity, traits that Jim saw in Abby, was to go back on the deal and start a fight claim Jim as hers only. There was some pain in his head as it split in half, leaving him with two heads. He resumed his advance as he knew he&#39;d need to get out of the cave in order to keep from being trapped by it because of his growing size. He could feel his claws easily digging into the dirt and rock of the cave as he advanced and as his heads split again, leaving him with four. They split again as he reached the mouth of the cave, leaving him with eight as Sandra backed up.<br />
<br />
As he emerged he saw Abby come over from another section of the mountain near the cave. She had bite and burn marks over her body, though she didn&#39;t look too terribly hurt, though neither did Sandra. They obviously hadn&#39;t made any moves against their heads, but then, that wouldn&#39;t have worked. Jim&#39;s left most head, his scientific head, reasoned that the hydra DNA in Sandra and Abby would only make attacking each other&#39;s heads and necks an exercise in making Sandra or Abby more powerful, as they&#39;d only grow new heads to replace the one that was lost. Once out side the cave, Jim felt his growth accelerate, like it had to grow to his full dragon/hydra hybrid size. He then aligned himself to stand by Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy you got really sexy,&quot; Abby&#39;s lust filled head said with a smile, &quot;I know what I want to do after we take care of that deal breaking witch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did grow big, strong, and sexy,&quot; Sandra agreed, and breathed fire at Abby, making her duck her heads down. &quot;But he is mine. It was our deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our deal was to give you children so that you wouldn&#39;t be alone and that Abby and I would go free afterward,&quot; said Jim&#39;s fourth head, his noble head, spoke, &quot;But it is clear by your actions that you had no intention of honoring the deal you made. It is clear that all you wanted from me was a sex slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra paused for a moment, and caught a great deal of disapproval and even hostility in that voice, which Jim was very honest in expressing. He could feel it as he glared at Sandra with his golden eyes. Like Abby, various parts of his personality controlled each of his eight heads. Going from left to right was his first head was his scientific head, with all his knowledge on geology and various other sciences, including the biological natures of the three dragon/hydra hybrids. Next in his second head adventurous and carefree head, which enjoyed travel and was content to go with the flow. Next in his third head was his furious/angry head, which wasn&#39;t about forgive Sandra for trying to make him her slave, and wouldn&#39;t Abby&#39;s other heads make him her slave either. Next in his fourth head was his noble head, which would stand firm for what was right and to protect the weak, and it was the noble head that had the most control over Jim&#39;s body. Next in his fifth head was his romantic head which loved Abby and would do anything for her. Next in his sixth head was his cocky head, which for good or for bad was always confident in everything Jim would do. Next in his seventh head was his understanding head, which understood Sandra&#39;s want to be loved and have a family as well as the griffon&#39;s fears of Sandra&#39;s actions.  Next in his eighth head was a more feral head, though it was more like a loyal dog. It would attack viciously on the noble head&#39;s command to it, but at the same time it would be soft, loyal, and friendly to anyone the noble head liked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t what we agreed to,&quot; Jim&#39;s furious head snarled, &quot;I&#39;m NO ONE&#39;S slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wished to deceive us,&quot; Jim&#39;s noble head added, &quot;For that, YOU broke the deal that you made and was offered to you. ABBY is my mate, NOT you. You lost all right to claim me when you went back on your own deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve acted without any understanding for those around you and the fear you&#39;ve inspired,&quot; Jim&#39;s understanding head added.<br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s central head smiled. That demonstrated that Jim did love her. Sure he&#39;d sacrificed his humanity just as she had to protect him, but he had made his stance to side with her against Sandra. Even her angry and surly heads admitted Jim&#39;s vows of loyalty to her was nice. Abby also found herself agreeing with her lust filled head. With his sapphire blue scales, which glistened in the sunlight, Jim was a rather sexy dragon/hydra hybrid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you yield?&quot; Jim&#39;s noble head asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never!&quot; Sandra snarled back, her ten feral heads thrashing around her head in defiance, &quot;I am and will be the Queen. You will be MINE... even if I have to beat those blue scales off of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim answered only by letting forth a burst of flames from his noble and angry heads. Unlike Sandra and Abby, who breathed a orange/red colored flames, Jim&#39;s dragon fire was blue, which his scientific head knew was a drastic power difference. Typically, flames and their heat had been judged by the color of the flame. Blue flames were actually hotter than red, orange, or yellow flames, though typically it wasn&#39;t something that was consistent. Fire was affected by gravity, as everything else, and the parts near the ground and nearest to the fuel commonly burned hotter than it did elsewhere, thus when looking at a lit candle that the blue in the flame was only close to the wick while the rest of the flame was cooler. The only times when a blue flame was common and more uniform was with gas ovens, heaters, stoves, and so on, which poured a narrow stream of a more combustible fuel into the fire to keep it going at a hotter temperature. Jim, however, had the strength in his dragon fire to do that naturally and was more than happy to teach that lesson to Sandra.<br />
<br />
Behind him, Abby watched as Sandra began to back away, and actually giving a cry of pain. Her battle had been rough and she was heavily thankful for the thick and strong scalely armor that covered her massive body, as she needed it to protect her from the torrent of flames, acid, and even ice that Sandra had shot at her. It didn&#39;t do her serious harm, and she could withstand the bite wounds that she had taken to her forelegs, her wings, and even her sides as she had wrestled with Sandra trying to get at the other female dragon/hydra hybrid&#39;s belly, but conversely, she wasn&#39;t that fully do Sandra serious harm either. There was some of Sandra&#39;s blood on her claws and teeth of all of her heads, but it wasn&#39;t enough to overpower her rival, and Sandra&#39;s feral heads often attacked without any real direction. It gave Sandra&#39;s central head more control over her body, but it made real coordination  for her difficult and that forced Abby to look for ways to protect her intelligent and even her lust filled head... which was really the source for why she had come to agree with all her heads that Jim&#39;s help was badly needed.<br />
<br />
And now Jim was helping and was even doing enough to put Sandra in some pain. Abby stretched out her great wings and moved into the air to look for some way to get the drop on Sandra or attack her from behind, and the battle began again, now in earnest.</p>
