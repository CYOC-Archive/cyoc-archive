<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You really do want to join her in the shower, but at the same time your desire confuses you. Before you used the light on Christina you are certain that you had no interest in other women, now you can't get enough of her. Maybe there's something more to the situation than you first thought, something you missed. You think back over the years the two of you have been friends and all the time you spent together. At any point was there anything more than friendship? Did you ever feel attracted to her the same way she was to you?<br />
<br />
In the end you decide that yes, maybe there was something deeper to your friendship, otherwise why would have you been so determined to get her away from her jerk of a boyfriend and to have her be yours instead? That might not have been your plan at the start, but that was how things had ended up and you have to admit that the results are wonderful.<br />
<br />
Christina is looking at you expectantly and you realize that you do need to say something.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll wait,&quot; you say, despite your longing to shower with her, &quot;All of this has happened so suddenly that I don't know if I want to make a big show of us yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks hurt for a moment, but then understanding dawns on her, &quot;You're right. If I make a big show about you being my girlfriend right after Rodger dumped me people are going to think that I don't actually love you, that I'm doing it just to spite that asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giving you a tight hug and a quick kiss she leaves the dorm room to take a shower, leaving you alone to think.<br />
<br />
As soon as she's gone you retrieve the flashlight and stare at, amazed at what it has done for you. You also realize that you want to use it again, not on Christina, but on yourself. You've seen what it can do to other people and you want to feel it for yourself, especially because of how more confident Christina has become. It's hot thinking of how at ease she is with her new body and the way she started to take charge when you made love. You just need to decide what you want to do to yourself.<br />
<br />
Making yourself a genuine tomboy like Christina, complete with a clit-cock, is the first thing that comes to mind, but you're not sure that's the direction you want to go. It might be better to do something different and see where that takes you. Of course, if you don't like the results you can always use the light to change yourself back and no one will know, so there's always that.<br />
<br />
Smiling, you walk over to the mirror so you can better see whatever you end up doing to yourself. Since the end results could be just about anything you decide to start small and work up from there.<br />
<br />
First you look yourself over, giving serious thought to what you see. You're an average looking girl with shoulder length brown hair, brown eyes and a small, slightly weak looking mouth. In terms of build you're slightly plump without actually being overweight, which gives a pleasant softness to your b-cup breasts, and your tendency to slouch slightly makes you look shorter than you are. Still, you're not exactly displeased without how you look, which is why you decide to start small.<br />
<br />
Putting the light on a medium-low pink setting you shine it on your chest and watch as your breasts perk up. At first it's really just an increase in firmness, which makes them look rounder, though soon you realize that there's been a slight, but undeniable increase in size. You gently rub at your breasts, trying out their new feel and liking what you find. Each is a bit more than a handful now and they have a slight bit more bounce to them.<br />
<br />
Turning the light to a brighter pink setting you shine it on your chest again and this time you feel the results as well as see them. This round of growth takes them to what you guess to being the larger end of the b-cup range, possibly into a small c. Their new weight makes them sag slightly, creating a feeling of gentle pressure and weight on your chest, but their increase in size also makes them look rounder and more perky. You shift your weight from one foot to the other and watch as your breasts sway. A little jump and they bounce.<br />
<br />
Again you increase the intensity of the pink light and shine it on your chest, not sure of what your end goal is. Your breasts continue it inflate, reaching a very impressive c-cup before they stop. This time when you shift your weight they jiggle and sway quite a bit more and it takes considerably longer for the movement to stop. There's also been a change to your nipples and areola, which have grown larger and deepened in color. Curious, you gently squeeze your breast and are amazed by how good it feels. The light has not only made your breasts larger, they have become far more sensitive.<br />
<br />
Pleased by the results so far you use the light again, this time putting it on its highest pink setting, just to see how far it can go. Your breasts balloon out, quickly surpassing a d-cup. By the time the growth stops your breasts are a triple d, maybe even larger and your nipples stick out nearly half an inch. yet, despite their increased size, your breasts remain round and firm. They look almost fake, but when you touch them, their softness is genuine and all natural.<br />
<br />
Cautiously you take a step and gasp at the sensation. Your breasts are large enough that, even free like this, they rub against each other. It feels so good that you cannot help but rub at your breasts, cupping them in your hands and delighting at their heavy roundness.<br />
<br />
More than satisfied with the results you carefully hide the flashlight away in your dresser and start to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Just like the directions said, the light has caused reality to adjust and when you retrieve your bra it is perfectly sized for your new breasts. Fastening it across your chest creates a wonderful feeling of pressure against your breasts and the support makes them stick out further still. They still bounce a bit when you walk and the feeling now sends an almost orgasmic jolt through you.<br />
<br />
Getting your shirt on takes a bit of effort and once it's on you can see your nipples tenting the fabric, the diamond hard little nubs just begging to be teased and played with. You can already imagine Christina sucking on them and how good that will feel.<br />
<br />
Lost in admiring yourself you fail to notice that Christina has returned from the shower until she walks up behind you and gives your breasts a squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh!&quot; you squeal, your legs nearly giving out at the pleasure you get from her touch.<br />
<br />
She laughs and gives you a kiss on your cheek, &quot;Couldn't wait for me to get back, huh? Or was the attention I gave them earlier not enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I - oh,&quot; you gasp again as she begins to rub her fingers in slow circles around your nipples, occasionally breaking the pattern to flick or squeeze them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really like it when I play with your tits, don't you?&quot; she purrs in your ear, pressing her lean, muscular body against yours.<br />
<br />
You nod, unable to speak through moaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good,&quot; she gives you a soft kiss on the cheek, &quot;Because I love playing with them. I love groping them, and licking them and sucking on those big, hard nipples of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stops just in time.<br />
<br />
Beneath your pants your panties are sodden from all the pleasure her attentions have caused you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later we'll have some more fun, but how about now I get dressed and then we go and get something to eat?&quot; Christina offers, licking her lips, &quot;We won't get dessert while we're out though, because I know that I'm going to be having pussy for dessert when we get back, how about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you agree weakly, already thinking about sucking on her clit-cock and eating out her wonderful, tasty pussy.</p>
