<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trio of attacks now found the teens regrouping inside the Magic Shop. Although mostly unharmed, the attacks had left then shaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merlin what can you tell us a out those things,&quot; Gloria asked. The ancient wizard frowned as he gazed at the teens. &quot;Those are the creatures we have feared,&quot; he said. &quot;They were the ones responsible for the attack at the hotel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are they,&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
Merlin waved his hand, slowly conjuring an image of their attackers. &quot;From the information I have gathered,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;They are creatures from an entirely different timeline. One that has no connection to ours, yet is quite similar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait are you telling me they&#39;re human,&quot; Sasha exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somewhat,&quot; Merlin stated. &quot;It is quite complicated. But I will try to explain.&quot; Gesturing towards the images he now brought forth the images of Abolith and the monstrous Malak. &quot;Those are the two that trashed Adam&#39;s car,&quot; Felicia whispered, shuddering slightly. &quot;His mom is going to be pissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be able to fix the car,&quot; Merlin smiled. &quot;These two though are Malak and Abolith the Undying. Malak is a demon while Abolith is a dark elf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That thing is a demon,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;He has to be the strongest demon ever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have been magically enhanced,&quot; Merlin stated. &quot;During their travels through the various timelines they&#39;ve acquired powers beyond compare. Malak in his original timeline was a demon whose strength was perhaps on par with some of the lesser demons of hell. Now, his strength rivals some of the rulers of Hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teens shuddered as they gazed at image of Malak. &quot;So what about her,&quot; Sasha asked, pointing at Abolith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith was already a skilled combatant before she aligned herself with Villar,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;Dark elves are quite agile however they usually do not leave their realm. She appears to be the exception, now her master has made her nearly impossible to kill. Hence the moniker undying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the others,&quot; Diane said quickly, trying to change the subject. Merlin now brought forth the images of Casseus and Fukushu. &quot;I won&#39;t go into an incredible amount of detail with Fukushu,&quot; Merlin grumbled. &quot;After all our dealings with him I believe we know what he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has he been enhanced,&quot; Naomi asked. Merlin shook his head, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. &quot;I do not believe so,&quot; he said. &quot;However it may only be a matter of time. Casseus, however, has been enhanced. Believe it or not in his original timeline he was human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That guys human,&quot; Naomi exclaimed, to which Merlin nodded. &quot;Holy crap I mean I hit him in the face with a kamehameha wave and a Plus Ultra smash. He should have been knocked out for sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Naomi,&quot; Yuriko sighed, placing a hand on her teenage aunt&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I love you and everything but seriously, you need to chill with the anime.&quot; Naomi blushed slightly as the group stifled a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally Naomi that would have been enough,&quot; Merlin smiled. &quot;However his master has enhanced him to such a degree that his durability is far beyond human.&quot; Merlin now pulled forth the final image. &quot;And his master is the one he truely need to fear.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teens now stared at the image of the dark haired man Merlin had brought forth. &quot;This is Villar,&quot; he sighed. &quot;While he too is human, his magical abilities have warped him into a virtual god. Before his ascension he was already a powerful wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes a wizard,&quot; Gloria asked. Merlin nodded sadly as he gazed at Villar. &quot;Yes,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You see in a timeline far removed from our own, he is the son of Kellie Pendragon and Jack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait that&#39;s my nephew Ty,&quot; Gloria gasped. &quot;How?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have yet to truely discover how he came into being,&quot; Merlin said sadly. &quot;From what I was a left to discern in a far flung timeline Fukushu kidnapped the infant and raised him as his own. As a result the child grew up with a tremendous amount of darkness within him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do we stop him,&quot; Sasha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not sure we can,&quot; Merlin shrugged. &quot;Ty or should I say Villar increases his power with each new timeline he conquers. He has already destroyed countless timelines, killing other versions of you, adding their magical essence to his own. He has now come to this timeline to take my essence.:<br />
<br />
&quot;He wants to kill you,&quot; Ann gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Merlin nodded. &quot;If he is able to kill me he will be able to merge two of the most powerful timelines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our doppelgangers timeline,&quot; Gloria whispered.<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded once more as the teens fidgeted nervously. &quot;That is why I must do something I thought I would never have conceived.&quot; Gesturing towards the back of the Magic Shop the teens watched as the other Merlin as well as the adult Mia and Zack emerged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia? Zack,&quot; Yuriko asked. &quot;What are you doing her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Needed to talk with you Yuki,&quot; Mia said. &quot;In private.&quot; Yuriko nodded, excusing herself as she followed her godparents. As they left the two Merlins smiled at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you going to do,&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Millenia ago I split myself into several pieces,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;It was quite exhausting trying to exist in several timelines at once. Letting my essence separate into other timelines just made things easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the cost of my magical power,&quot; the other Merlin said. &quot;Which is why I need to merge with my doppleganger now to regain my full power.&quot; The other Merlin now gazed at the version of himself from this timeline. &quot;You have done well but I think it is time for us to become one once more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Merlin smirked. &quot;I am looking forward to being a father.&quot; Closing their eyes the two Merlins now began to mumble a spell.<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends watched as the two Merlins began to glow. The Merlin from their timeline now began to shimmer, his body seeming to waver. Taking the hand of his doppleganger, Merlin now began to absorb him. It was hard to describe but Gloria could only describe it as two images merging into a single, clear picture. In a flash of blinding light the teens blinked, seeing that only a single Merlin now stood before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Merlin are you okay,&quot; Felicia asked.<br />
<br />
Merlin opened his eyes a small smile on his face. &quot;I&#39;m quite well Gloria,&quot; he said. &quot;Merging with my doppleganger has given me his memories. He exists within me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I&#39;m still a little confused,&quot; Sasha stated. &quot;Are you saying the Merlin we&#39;ve been dealing with was a clone or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that,&quot; Merlin grinned. &quot;Regardless I have returned to my full strength. Considering the threat and that my daughter is busy forging alliances, this strength will be needed.&quot; The teens nodded as they now began to form a plan to deal with the threat.</p>
