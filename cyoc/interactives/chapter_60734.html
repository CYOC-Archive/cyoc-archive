<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty hadn't always had this power. As he grew up they started to develop and when the powers start to manifest a <br />
mentor finds the new initiate and guides him in the use of his powers.<br />
<br />
Ty's mentor was Layne. I nice gentleman that used his powers less and less but every so often he would find <br />
someone that needed to learn a lesson.<br />
<br />
That happened recently with Tony and Carl.<br />
<br />
Tony was a short 5'6&quot; 180 pound furry bear of a man that, like a badger would take on anything that came <br />
along.<br />
<br />
Carl was a tall, somewhat lanky but adequately muscled man that really followed Tony around like a puppy dog. <br />
Doing whatever Tony wanted or told him to do.<br />
<br />
When Layne found these two picking on some boys he finally decided to take action. He put the idea in their <br />
heads to start on a bit more of a crime spree, breaking into homes and taking what they wanted. What they <br />
didn't know was that the first house they were going to break into was Layne's.<br />
<br />
Once they had gotten in they found themselves in the basement, reasoning that the best stuff would be there. <br />
As soon as they got there and looked around the found an array of bondage devices that they had never seen <br />
before. Within moments they both went black and when they woke up they woke in the very strange devices and <br />
naked as they day they were born.<br />
<br />
Wake up boys Layne said.<br />
<br />
What the hell?<br />
<br />
Don't worry about screaming you wont be heard.<br />
<br />
Let us loose old man.<br />
<br />
That is my goal. But first we are going to have some fun. Well I am going to have some fun you two might not <br />
enjoy it.<br />
<br />
What are you going to do to us?<br />
<br />
Well now aren't we anxious.<br />
<br />
Tony was hanging from his arms and chest with a leather strap around his pecs holing up his body. His legs <br />
were cuffed and spread eagle.<br />
<br />
Carl was seated with his arms strapped close to his body as well as his legs strapped together.<br />
<br />
Well if your in such a hurry here we go.<br />
<br />
Layne pressed a button and Tony raised into the air and moved over above Carl. Slowly lowering him over Carl <br />
his ass began to press up against Carl's face. Lower and lower till Carl's head was fully inside Tony's ass. <br />
The screams were exquisite coming from both boys.<br />
<br />
Lower and lower until Carl's shoulders were now heading through Tony's ass. Tony could feel his pelvis <br />
breaking and reforming to allow access to his body. Carl, although pretty much the same was now more <br />
gelatenous allowing him to bend over into a fetal position as he went further and further inside Tony. He <br />
still had all his bones but they moved in order for him to fully fit inside of Tony. An umbilical cord <br />
attached his belly button to Tony's body so that he would be fed this way for now.<br />
<br />
You see boys, Layne said. You two have been quite the little monsters. You Tony are quite the demanding little <br />
Nazi. And Carl you really need to learn to be your own man. This is how you are going to learn that.<br />
<br />
Tony you are going to learn what it is like to take care of another human being. You need to take care of Carl <br />
while he is in your belly. And no he isn't going to get any smaller. Your belly will stick out like this until <br />
I decide you are done with your education.<br />
<br />
And Carl what does it feel like to be shit on by Tony all the time. Doing his grunt work. Carl could hear and <br />
could respond somewhat to Layne and Tony even though no one else would be able to hear.<br />
<br />
So here is the deal boys. You get one year of this. Come back here in a year and I will consider your <br />
situation and we will decide what you two deserve.<br />
<br />
I'm going to the cops Tony said.<br />
<br />
And what will they be able to do? You will be a freak and there is no way they will believe that someone was <br />
able to do this to you. It is beyond human capabilities.<br />
<br />
Then I will go to the Doctor and have Carl removed.<br />
<br />
Same problem first you will be a freak and second the doctor will probably not do it fearing you will be <br />
injured and if he does when you leave you two will find each other and Carl will crawl up your ass again. And <br />
you thought this was painful it will be a lot worse if he does that.<br />
<br />
Tony thought about it. Why a year? Let us go now we will be good.<br />
<br />
Yea well I don't think you have had enough of an education. It will be a year.<br />
<br />
Layne released Tony from the rig and as he tried to stand up he realized that he had a huge ball belly. <br />
Although Carl was a taller man he wasn't that much heavier but that double in his weight made his balance off. <br />
Layne got Tony a shirt that fit over Tony's belly hanging loose making it look like he was pregnant. Which in <br />
a way he was. His pants didn't fit any more because his hips were now so large from the repositioning of his <br />
pelvis but Layne had a pair that fit fine and sagged down in the front from the weight in his newly formed <br />
belly.<br />
<br />
Now remember, Layne said, your eating for two these days. Layne shuttled Tony out the door swatting his now <br />
ample butt.</p>
