<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly was at home eating supper of a Caesar salad steak when the doorbell rang. Sighing, she got up and walked over to the door. She hated it when people interrupted meals!<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Shelly felt a warm breeze hit her face. She decided that after supper, she would go on a walk while it was still light out and warm. Standing at the door was a man in a navy blue uniform holding a package. He looked to be in his mind twenties. He smiled and nodded at Shelly.<br />
<br />
“Hi,” the man said, looking at the packaging slip. “Package for a Shelly Gardner.”<br />
<br />
Shelly looked at the package and raised her right eyebrow. “I don’t remember ordering anything.”<br />
<br />
The man shrugged his shoulders. “Maybe a family member sent it to you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I guess. So, how much do I owe you?” Shelly asked.<br />
<br />
The man shook his head. “Whoever sent this has already paid for it.”<br />
<br />
Shelly nodded, signed the slip, thanked the man and took the package from him before he left. As she closed the door behind her, Shelly put the package on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I wonder who would send me something? My birthday isn’t for another three months.”<br />
<br />
Shelly was about to go back to her meal when she felt an urge to open the box. After retrieving her keys from the closet, he used them to cut the tape atop the box. With the box open, she cleared the Styrofoam packaging, revealing what seemed to be a wig.<br />
<br />
“A wig?” Shelly asked.<br />
<br />
Lifting the wig out of the box, Shelly saw it was reddish brown. It was huge and felt more like the hair of an animal then that of a human. The wig felt not only warm in her hands but also inviting. As she held it, emotions of power and a sense of well being entered her mind.<br />
<br />
Feeling more then a little weirded out, she was about to put it back into the box when she felt a compulsion to place it on her head.<br />
<br />
As she raised it, she stopped herself. “What the heck am I doing? There could be something wrong with it! I don’t know where this came from and here I am, about to wear it!”<br />
<br />
However, even holding the wig was making Shelly feel wonderful. That feeling won out over her common sence and Shelly placed it over her head and hair.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, Shelly saw that the wig looked more like a mane then hair. Her head tingled and at first she worried, someone had drugged the wig. However, that feeling soon faded only for a wonderful feeling of contentment to replace it.<br />
<br />
Walking back into the dining room, Shelly found herself getting hungrier then she’d been when she’d started eating. She devoured the rest of the streak with enthusiasm she hadn’t had in years. When she’d finished it, she found that the salad had little appeal to her.<br />
<br />
After poking at the salad, Shelly walked back into the kitchen and picked out the second piece of steak she’d made in case she was still hungry after. As she walked, she noticed that she felt taller and that her clothes felt tight. Her body was starting to itch and her muscles ached.<br />
<br />
Emotionally, Shelly felt so wonderful that she didn’t bother to dwell on how she felt physically. Without bothering to go back to the dining room, she devoured the second piece of streak by holding it in her bare hands and tearing it with her teeth.<br />
<br />
It was then that Shelly felt vigor unlike anything she’d ever experienced. She was never a strong person by any means but now she felt stronger. It was a sensation she enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Shelly walked into the bathroom to brush her teeth. When she saw her reflection, she gasped.<br />
<br />
The wig had spread all around her head with a line of the hair now going down her chest. Shelly tried to remove it only to find that it hurt to pull on the hair as though it was her own! <br />
<br />
She also noticed that orange hair appeared to be sprouting all over her face. A look down at her arms confirmed it was growing on there was all!<br />
<br />
“What’s happening?”<br />
<br />
Shelly grabbed her mouth when she heard her voice! It was several octaves too low! As she held her mouth, she felt something pushing against her hands. As well, the muscles in her arms, muscles that didn’t seem to be there only minutes ago were sore and seemed to be getting larger!<br />
<br />
Letting go of her mouth, Shelly looked at what were becoming orange fur covered arms to see that she had muscles that were growing larger almost by the second!<br />
<br />
A tingle began to spread across her chest. Shelly took her shirt off to see two things that shocked her. One, her chest was now covered by light orange fur and she was developing a six pack. Two, her breasts were shirking! The line of fur that spread down from her mane went between her breasts all the way down to her crotch.<br />
<br />
Having had enough, Shelly ran out of the bathroom and into the kitchen to call for help.<br />
<br />
She was almost at the telephone when she felt a surge of warmth hit her hips, waist and groin. Shelly put her hands on her hips and felt them getting smaller. Worse, she felt a burning in her groin. A look down at her chest confirmed that her breasts were gone. She gathered by the courage to feel her face only to find a muzzle in place of her jaw. She felt around the rest of her head, coming into contact with round ears in place of her human ears.<br />
<br />
Shelly felt something in her groin. She had an idea of what it was but she didn’t want to admit it. With furry hands, she managed to undo her jeans and slide them down her legs. A bulge in her panties greeted her, sending shivers down her spine. Something felt drastically different down there. Shelly gulped as she slid her panties down her legs.<br />
<br />
What greeted her at the end of the line of mane fur spreading down her chest was a male organ surrounded by the fur. Shelly gasped, this couldn’t be happening! Someone must have put drugs in the wig and she was hallucinating this! Shelly shook her head. If this was a hallucination then whatever drugs were in that wig must have been well made!<br />
<br />
“Humans don’t turn into animals. Women don’t become men without extensive surgery! Therefore, I am not turning into a lion man!”<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, becoming male was not the end of it. Shelly saw orange fur begin to sprout on her legs. For a few seconds, she felt annoyed that she’d have to shave it off only to realize that with a fur-covered body, shaving one's legs would be silly.<br />
<br />
Shelly considered the possibility that this was real.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, I’m a guy! I’m an animal! Why did I put this thing on?” Shelly cried.<br />
<br />
Shelly made another effort to tear the mane off. It didn’t work and only produced pain. If this weren’t real then from Shelly’s point of view, the mane would have come off. What was worse was that she couldn’t feel her hair under the mane! When she felt arround the hairs, she felt not the bottom of the wig but her head!<br />
<br />
Shelly watched as the fur reached her feet. She also felt a tingle at the base of her spine. She looked at the organ between her legs. It was one that guys lived with every day of their lives. Some women would strive to have access to one as much as possible so as long as it was on another person! Yet others while interested in them were happy to have female parts. Shelly had sometimes wondered how guys walked around with those things but also how having one would feel.<br />
<br />
When her feet tingled and she felt something brush against the back of her legs, Shelly looked back to see that she had a tail! Her feet were becoming larger and furrier.<br />
<br />
The changes seemed complete when her feet were done changing. Shelly was a lion man.<br />
<br />
“I’m … no! It must be drugs! It can’t be real! But, I feel so powerful!” Shelly said.<br />
<br />
Shelly wondered what to do next.</p>
