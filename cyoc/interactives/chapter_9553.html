<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken thought he'd made a rather clever escape from the Olympians with his time machine.  Well, he thought that before he became a goat and for the next two hours he had pleasure beyond compare as a buck.  His mind completely fogged with bestial desire.  His euphoria was not to last as long as he wished, though.<br />
<br />
A temporal gate opened and Khronos, Lord of Time, Father of Zeus stepped into Ken's lab.<br />
<br />
&quot;An interesting toy you have there, My young buck, but I'm afraid tampering with time is not for mortals!&quot;  Khronos said with a chuckle.  Ken's mind cleared as the God spoke and he understood everything, but was powerless to do anything.  Khronos reached forth with His hand, wiggled His fingers and the time machine vanished in a wavering like a mirage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid you cannot be allowed to tamper with temporal matters after this point as it would disrupt what is, was and will be.  However, thus far, you have done as I have charted eons ago, before the Kosmoswas born.  You serve Me well young buck!”  Khronos chuckled again and shook His head.<br />
<br />
“You see, you came back to a time before the birth of Pan as was planned by Me from the beginning.  Now I must finish what I have begun.  You will find that all plans for your machine are no longer and your mind will no longer be able to conceive of such a device ever again.&quot;  Khronos said.<br />
<br />
With a wave of His hand the two 'Satyresses' became the 'Nymphs' they should have been all along.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear buck, every Olympian knows that there is no such thing as a 'Satyress'!  It is a modern concept conceived in error and held by you lusty men of the future who have quite forgotten the myths.  If you had but understood that, you would have taken a different path, one I had not charted and traveled down the road of Khaos.  Instead, you chose Hera’s plan and walk on the path of Kosmos.  Just as I had charted long ago, you chose the error instead of the truth and thus found the true path for your existence.  For all your knowledge of the Olympians and the lesser beings of our world, you obviously forgot that Satyrs are the male earth principle and Nyphs are the female water principle.  The proper mate for a Satyr is a Nymph, a water spirit, as Satyrs are earth spirits who’s proper mates are Nymphs.  There are no male nymphs just as there are no female satyrs!  Ah, but you have another destiny waiting.  It is something far greater than being a simple Satyr of the meadows and glades!&quot;  Khronos said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come!&quot;  The great grey bearded God commanded and in an instant the two Nymphs and the buck wavered out of modern existence like the time machine had moments ago.<br />
<br />
In an instant the four stood in the Court of Zeus.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Father!  I see you have found the wayward trio, good!”  Zeus thundered.<br />
<br />
“As it was planned in the beginning, so it has come to pass.  I take my leave now, they are Yours!”  Khronos said and vanished.<br />
<br />
“Kenneth!  Come before me!”  Zeus spoke and thunder rolled in His voice.  Zeus waived His hand in dismissal toward the nymphs and they left the court, back to the bath they came from.<br />
<br />
The buck trotted, hesitantly, to the God.<br />
<br />
“You have come to witness the Birth of Pan!  So shall it be!”  Zeus proclaimed.  “Mother, I believe this buck is now ready to witness the coming of the Horned God of the Glades.  He who is not Beast, not God and yet not Man and but all three!”<br />
<br />
With that Rhea, entered the court from behind the throne of Zeus.<br />
<br />
Rhea said in a voice that chimed like crystals of the deep earth, “So it shall come to pass, as was charted by My Husband before there was Kosmos!”<br />
<br />
Rhea’s eyes flared like the fires of a volcano and Ken the buck began to glow white.  His goatish body shrank; limbs, head and neck pulling into his torso.  Ken felt no pain as he became a ball of light the size of a pea.  The ball grew a tail and squirmed in mid air like a tadpole.  Rhea lifted Her garments revealing Her naked lower half and gestured with both hands as a mother calling Her child to Her.  Ken was drawn into the womb of the Goddess, wriggling toward Rhea, swimming through the air.  Her opening gaped and took the seed in.<br />
<br />
Zeus thundered, “It is done!”<br />
<br />
Rhea, Mother of the Gods, began to grow large about the waist.  Her belly distended as though She were pregnant.  Minutes passed and larger She grew.  In mere moments She grew so large it looked as though She would deliver Her child.  She passed nine months of gestation in the space of nine minutes.<br />
<br />
“Behold!”  Rhea cried, “The Birth of Pan, Horned Lord of the Glade and Wood: Not Beast, not God and not Man and yet all three!”<br />
<br />
With that Her water broke and Pan’s hornless head passed from between Rhea’s legs, out of Her womb.<br />
<br />
He was small, with a light coating of hair all over his body.  He had soft cloven hooves that had not yet hardened.  His eyes were golden and had rectangular horizontal slits as the horse and deer, the sheep and goat have because they are prey; but Pan not being completely a beast was not prey.  He was Man, Beast and God all in one!<br />
<br />
Athena bound the umbilical cord twice with sturdy knots of cord woven by the fates and severed it between the ties with Her sword.  She picked up the Godling in Her arms, wrapped in cloth.  She brought Pan before Zeus.<br />
<br />
Zeus looked into those golden goat eyes, “Already Your memories of Your human life are fading but while You still remember that You once were a man I want You to know I have fulfilled My promise.  You witnessed the Birth of Pan in the most intimate way, You are now and forevermore Pan!  Athena, see that He is given Nectar and Ambrosia that He may grow to full Godhood in a short space of time.  Pan has work in the world.  <br />
There are nymphs to be pleasured and satyrs to be made and Dionysus and Apollo await His arrival!<br />
<br />
With that, Athena took the Great God Pan to be fed and His thirst slaked.</p>
