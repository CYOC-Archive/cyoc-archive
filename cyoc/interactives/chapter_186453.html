<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carlyle gingerly touched his body, testing with eager hands the results of all his financial maneuvers and acquisitions. After so long, languishing in that ancient body, he had finally returned to the promised youth. It was not the eighteen years of age he thought he was going to get, but as Carlyle tested a look at his smirking features, he did look quite boyishly handsome still. When he touched his body his eyes widened. He was a swimmer at 16, and a damn good one, but it seemed that he was a bit more muscular now than he had been when he was 16 originally. He had a few pictures of himself back then for memory&#39;s sake for comparison.<br />
<br />
Getting up from his seat and grumbling a bit at the way his suit was covering his body, Carlyle barely even thought of Ethan, still standing there observing him for the time being. Mostly making sure his newly regressed boss was in good health so soon after such a gargantuan physical alteration. Carlyle removed his suit, pants and stood there in a pair of tighty whities only barely hanging on to him. He grinned and lightly pounded his chest, &quot;I!&quot; Another pound, &quot;Am!&quot; Another, &quot;So!&quot; And one last time, &quot;RIPPED!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t exactly a huge, musclebound man, but he was definitely very toned indeed, and very much enjoying it. Grinning like a fool as he proceeded to flex his biceps right then and there. Ethan clapped as he watched this, &quot;You&#39;re...definitely looking pretty impressive, Carlyle---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No more Carlyle. That&#39;s an old guy&#39;s name. Call me Carl...dude.&quot; An awkward laugh from Carl as he made that assertion.<br />
<br />
Ethan wondered however how the brain chemistry of a younger man, so riven with testosterone and other hormones, might be affecting Carl&#39;s mind. Considering it had been so long since the older man had been so young. Maybe he wasn&#39;t used to the way things were when you were that young. When you thought you were invincible...<br />
<br />
Carl looked over at Ethan and chuckled, &quot;I...think I&#39;d like to test out exactly how strong this new body of mine is later. Let&#39;s hit the company gym together! Granted I need some new clothes. I&#39;ll give you my card to go get me some fitting clothes, &#39;kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
And that did bring up a fair point. As much as Carl felt great about this, most likely none of his clothes fit him well enough now. Ethan felt a wry smile come over his face as he watched Carl just keep flexing away. Loving the way his body now responded to him so well. He outright moved to go do some push ups then and there, laughing outloud at how amazingly strong he felt. Ethan wondered if there might be more options for testing this serum going forward. He accepted Carl&#39;s card, deciding to head out ASAP to provide those clothes.<br />
<br />
After all, teen or not, Carl still paid him. And wasn&#39;t this just another job...?<br />
<br />
He was again tempted to make use of it himself, remembering his own young days. But then, Ethan wasn&#39;t exactly old himself. Being forty five years old wasn&#39;t too bad. And he was in some of the best shape of his life. But just seeing how Carl was almost bouncing off the walls enjoying himself, it really left Ethan feeling tempted to join him in that.<br />
<br />
Ethan was about to leave to go get Carl his clothes when he was stopped by the young man shouting after him, &quot;Wait!&quot; Ethan stopped to hear if Carl had some specific requests, and he froze outright when he heard what Carl said next, &quot;It&#39;s been so long since I had a date. I was in my eighties after all. Ethan, while you&#39;re out, bring me a girlfriend back here. Like, one of the secretaries...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you...saying you want to go out with one of the secretaries?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! I&#39;m vital and strong again! I want to enjoy it!&quot; Carl - still clad in his ill-fitting underwear - cleared his suit from his chair and sat back in it, grinning somewhat lasciviously, &quot;I think Melissa was kinda cute. Tell her about what happened, and that I might be up for some fun in my office.&quot; Ethan knew Melissa pretty well - she was a rather flirtatious woman who seemed bored by the lack of real available men in the office there. Ethan was mostly associated with the lab secretaries, who he had pretty much fucked around with to a woman.<br />
<br />
But flirtatious or no, Ethan didn&#39;t know how Melissa would take to the young CEO.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...do that, Carl.&quot; Ethan gulped and headed out. All of the ego and machismo of a young man, and the senses and intelligence of an older man. Carl was now a completely different kind of man to interact with. One whom Ethan was now running a clothes and date arrangement for. He wondered what would become of the office by the time he got back.<br />
<br />
As Ethan passed Melissa&#39;s desk on his way to go get the teen CEO his new clothes, he said, &quot;Mr. Booth would like to see you. He&#39;s uh, different than usual. This time it actually worked, you know.&quot; A smile worked its way over Ethan&#39;s face, &quot;The serum, that is.&quot; Melissa, sitting there, was a raven haired beauty with an athletic body and long, wavy hair, her light blue eyes somewhat cradled by locks of her hair. Her bust immediately got attention in the kind of dress she wore to the job.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how young did he end up?&quot; She asked, affecting neutrality to the whole thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...think he ended up sixteen.&quot; Ethan nodded, and then kept walking, &quot;Keep a handle on it for now, at least until I can do more in depth health tests on him. He&#39;s...definitely vital though. Sounds like he&#39;s loving it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll go see what he&#39;s on about.&quot; Melissa got up from her desk and walked in toward Carl&#39;s office, where the young CEO was trying to sit at his desk and affect some measure of appeal. He spun in his chair and grinned, putting his arms up behind his neck and flexing them subtly. He&#39;d always liked Melissa, but he lacked the ability, as it were, to pursue her. But now she was heading right to his office, and he was back to being a dynamic, strong man!<br />
<br />
Ethan meanwhile kept walking out to the elevator, taking it to the first floor to go find the CEO some new clothes. And all the while his mind was still on the serum. He thought about potentially trying it out some more, potentially get some more test work in. Carl was a reasonable success. But as he proceeded on, Ethan pondered who else might benefit from the Chronos Drug.<br />
<br />
On the first floor, Ethan saw an elderly janitor moving around making sure the spacious first floor welcoming room was neat and clean...<br />
<br />
He saw David, a young up and coming man in his early thirties, well built already and known for his ambition and drive for the job. Maybe it might be interesting to apply the serum to David and see what happened with a subject who was already physically in great shape...<br />
<br />
And then there was Gus, the delivery guy. He well, delivered news and memos around the offices, and he was as always fast at work. 29 and in thin, svelte good shape, Ethan pondered offering the serum to Gus and seeing whether he went for it...</p>
