<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The woman was...understandably caught off-guard by his now exposed horns, giving them a silent stare for a moment as she took a step back. But after regaining her composure, she let out a sigh. ...Does this guy think he can avoid trouble by showing off his fake horns? Or... At least she figured they were fake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please. We would...appreciate if you left, sir. Or...if nothing else, stopped...staring...&quot; Her voice, however, began to trail off into nothing. She longer she looked at those horns he&#39;s got, the more...unnerved she felt by them. Of course, that&#39;s silly - they&#39;re just part of some stupid costume, after all. Though the man&#39;s growing smirk sure didn&#39;t help her feel more at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now, I think you should be able to make this place more interesting.&quot; She finally remarked, making the woman just take another step back.<br />
Taking the time to look her over before changing her, she was...cute, as much he could at least admit. Decently long her, seemingly naturally blonde, green eyes and a light complexion. She had a slim build, not anything that curvy or able to grab too much attention, especially not with that modestly sized bust of her&#39;s. Not to mention, the white button-up shirt that was part of her uniform did its job to obscure her curves a bit as well. A green tie and pants finished of her look - the tie even has the mall logo on it...<br />
<br />
&quot;Already shrimping away, huh? What happened to your guts from before?&quot; He asked, even if amused by her slowly stepping away from him. Seems she is finally starting to understand that she&#39;s dealing with someone of more significance. Oh well, too late for her now! The aura he was emitting is strengthen, and combined with a wicked grin appearing on his face, it sent shivers down the lady&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
...And then something else happened on her back. A sudden gasp escaped her as she hunched over,  feeling her back suddenly...throb? She couldn&#39;t see what was happening, but the Demon King sure could - from along her spine, pushing the shirt fabric up, was a row of hooked spikes, and as they met the end of the spine by her clad rear...another odd sensation hit her - suddenly pushing her ass outwards, a bulge began to to form down there, quickly growing in size and snaking its was down between each cheek. However... It wasn&#39;t just getting longer, but thicker as well - soon enough becoming quite the strong-looking tail...too strong to be contained by these pants, at the very least, as the fabric strained and began tearing around it, the noise more than enough to horrify the already overwhelmed lady.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, she recently tried to reach behind her, to attempt to figure out...what exactly that unfamiliar growth really was.<br />
&quot;Wh-wh-what is... N-no way this is... That I-I have...a tail...!&quot; The woman muttered to herself, any and all of her previous gutsiness seemingly gone at this point. But that&#39;s fine... Whatever her personality is really like, he&#39;ll have it replaced before long.<br />
<br />
Before she had even had time to let this new tail sink in, the she felt the changing, bizarre sensation run up from her new tail and through her waist and legs next. Of course, her feet were obscured within her shoes, but as she squirmed and wiggled her feet, she felt them quickly grown uncomfortable - it was as if her nails suddenly grew twice their length, pushing uncomfortably against the shoes...and that&#39;s indeed what was happening, as they grew and thickened into actual claws! Heck, it was even possible to see them poking out, soon enough starting to tear through the poor shoes.<br />
But while still terrified... she couldn&#39;t help but breathe heavily as she began to feel this...need start to build up within her. She couldn&#39;t comprehend why, but with dark red scales starting to form around her privates, he started to inject her with some much-needed lust. Scales were also forming on her feet and legs, as well as along those spikes on her back and the tail. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t cover her entire body in them, but she&#39;d definitely need a bit of scaliness.<br />
<br />
As changes kept going, her body felt like it was tensing up as well...muscles aching a bit as, even if she didn&#39;t evne notice it, they started to grow - legs, stomach, arms...all of which got a healthy boost in bulk. He could even see those pants of her&#39;s, at least the untorn legs of the pants, tighten around the new muscle! And meanwhile, once scales traveled up the sides of her waist and up her torso, in turn leaving her stomach itself exposed, a sudden warmth struck her breasts. She couldn&#39;t help but to cup them, despite actually being out among others like this. They felt so...strange...warm, even kind of...good? At this point, the lady was panting a bit - her breath hotter than any normal human&#39;s should be. That was to be expected though - after all, even as her outside was changing, so were her insides... Her reproductive system readjusting to lay eggs instead, some organs to allow for fire breath... But more important to her right now was her chest - the shirt quickly grew tight around them as they seemingly bloated up.<br />
&quot;Ah...! W-wait... They can&#39;t...&quot; She attempted to object all meekly, but he wasn&#39;t going to stop now. In fact, her timidness was almost a bit amusing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they will. You&#39;re going to need them for the plans I have for you...&quot; The Demon King finally spoke up again. But while she wanted to ask what he even meant by that, she&#39;s quickly distracted as a button shoots off her shirt. And while a single button would not hurt someone such as himself at all, he still blocked it with a tiny magic barrier before it struck him.<br />
At this point, her chest was essentially doubled in size, and...speaking of large sizes, her body itself was slowly gaining height, and combined with her new bulk, her uniform soon clung on her tightly...maybe a bit too tight for comfort for her - b-but taking it off wasn&#39;t an option either, so she just found herself trying to hide the new, open gap in her shirt under one of her arms. But speaking of arms... As she moved it, she could see her nails here, too, seemingly grow and gradually hook downwards, talking on a dark, almost black color. And her arm itself looked bigger, too, honestly kind of powerful. Especially once those red scales started to envelop her hands and arms, making small tears all across the tight shirt sleeves. <br />
<br />
Left with just her head unchanged, he remembered that she was still missing something rather important. And with that - a loud tearing sound rang out from behind her, making her try to look over her shoulder. ...Wings. Wings her abruptly sprouted from her back, leaving the lady seemingly speechless. Somehow though, she didn&#39;t feel...quite as horrified as she should be. To be honest, she found this...other need creeping up in her mind. If she were to be some kind of dragon creature, then she should...breed...or something. Sure, that kind of thought was embarrassing, but she couldn&#39;t help but think about it. As if that was her number-one priority...<br />
And while she was busy thinking about that, her blonde her darkened fast, gaining a shiny, black tint and going more unkempt then it previously was. Among the locks, a pair of horns protruded as well, changing her previously modest and pristine image into something unruly. That was intentional, of course... He always foudn it amusing to completely invert someone&#39;s character like that.<br />
<br />
With only the final few pieces left to change, he finished his new monster up - her green eyes lightened into some almost gold-colored eyes, complete with slit-shaped pupils. Her mouth found itself filled with sharper, more menacing teeth and even a sharper, rougher tongue, and her chin and cheeks were before long covered in those scales...<br />
<br />
Where this normal human woman had stood, was now a human-dragon hybrid...a needy dragon - one in need of a mate...and that need rang out in her mind - it blocked out any other thoughts. She couldn&#39;t...focus... Need a mate, lay eggs, fuck... Th-that&#39;s...all she needs to care about... The woman was panting, finding herself looking around at any of the other humans here. She couldn&#39;t even care less about their gender - she just needed someone...anyone at all!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Demon King took a step back. He wasn&#39;t going to keep his promise about leaving, but...he doubted she&#39;d care about that anymore. For now, let&#39;s see who she wants to go for next...and spread the monstrous changes to.</p>
