<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... I hope the pizza guy gets her soon ...&quot; Naomi called as Jen left her room.<br />
<br />
Moving down the hall to the stairs Jen thought about her current state of being.  She finally had the sexy model-esque body she had always dreamed about.  Her hair was perfect and her legs were long.  If she played her cards right this body would allow her to get everything she wanted in life.  And now that Dean was in the game with her she might be able to give him what she wanted also.<br />
<br />
Oh, there were problems right now.  For one, she still had that stupid grin on her face.  The one with dreamy eyes that seemed to ask people to make a move on her.  She had to fix that before she could be happy.  And her feet, walking on raised heels might be fine and painless now, but she did not want to be thought of as the girl that goes everywhere in heels.  Think of the beach; her in a stunning bikini showing off her new larger breasts and super long legs, but having to walk through sand in high-heeled flip-flops.  They had to go.<br />
<br />
Naomi and Cathy seemed happy to be freaks, Jen thought.  They must be having some kind of fun like that.  But it was only for tonight, right?  What about tomorrow?  They would be back to their normal selves or worse while Jen would be thinking of the future fun she could have with her body.  But then if everything went back to the new normal she might want to have some fun.  She idly wondered what sex with Dean would be like if he were hugely muscled, and she an enormous-titted cartoon woman.  They could do it a bit then go back to normal later.  Idle dreams she thought, too many things could go wrong.<br />
<br />
For one they would have to leave with the curse tonight and find some way to keep it to themselves.  What if Naomi wanted to play some more?  What if she could not trust Dean?  Jen was not selfish but she wanted some way to keep a bit of this power for herself, a tiny bit to make her life better no matter what would happen later.<br />
<br />
Jen stepped into the living room to find Dean and Cathy.  She was stunned for a moment.<br />
<br />
Dean was dressed in a small blue dress complete with white petty-coats.  A huge blue bow was tied to his hair and ribbons ran down his back.  His feet were covered in black, half-penny shoes and there were white stockings running up his legs.  The whole thing looked ridiculous on his stiff Ken-doll body.  The costume reminded Jen of Alice from the Disney movie but played by a muscular teen-boy.  Jen burst into laughter.<br />
<br />
Dean turned to see Jen and he was about to say something to explain his current dress but seeing that she was fingering her thatch he was cut off.  Jen's dare earlier to kiss her if he saw her doing that forced him to dash over the her and start making-out.  Jen did her best to stop laughing so that their lips could meet.  Once that happened she understood the reason and stopped touching her body.  But she continued to kiss Dean anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jen, Transform or Dare?&quot; Cathy called through grunts and heavy breathing.  Cathy seemed to have a hard time talking and Jen broke lips to see why.<br />
<br />
Cathy was bent over on her hands and feet sticking her ass in the air.  Her arms were bent and her head rested on the carpet flushed and red and sweaty.  Her eyes were almost unfocused and she was breathing short, fast gasps.  Jen took notice of her clothing which for some reason was now a large sheet of rectangular plastic.  A red checkered patter ran over the back of the plastic sheet that trapped the girl and the under side was white.  Cathy's feet stuck out the corners of the sheet and were bound in tight plastic socks both bright red and glossy.  Cathy's hands came out the top two corners of the sheet and were wrapped in bright, glossy white gloves.  She was digging into the carpet with her fingers and peddling with her feet.  Both seemed to be sliding about on the carpet as if the plastic offered very little friction to help her keep her ass in the air.<br />
<br />
The plastic sheet itself was wide and long.  The sides that ran down from her wrists ended at her ankles.  The short side ran from her hands to the top of her neck and forced her arms to be bent, elbows down, into two vee-shapes.  Her feet her spread about two and a half feet apart and connected by the plastic.  The whole sheet was vacuum packed onto her body revealing every part of her naked shape.  As Jen watched Cathy squirmed and twisted as much as she was able in the tight constricting suit.  The tightness of the plastic sheet seemed to prevent her bending any joint very far and her spine very little at all.<br />
<br />
Cathy soon tired and slumped to her knees crinkling the plastic between her legs.  She came to an upright position and Jen could see that the front was not just plain white; it was the five of diamonds.  Jen could see Cathy's still erect nipples poking through the sheet.  The poor girl was laminated into a playing card costume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, now I get it,&quot; Jen said, &quot;Cathy put you in a dress and you put her in a card.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, listen!  She made me.  Cathy stole my ...&quot; Dean tried to say before his costume changed again.  Suddenly his head was encased by a fluffy purple and grey striped cat's head that muffled his voice completely.  The rest of his body was soon covered with a saggy, fluffy halloween costume of the Cheshire Cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen,&quot; Cathy moaned drawing her attention.  &quot;Your curse about clothing that arouses me is still working.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Oh God!  And Dean here stuck me in this full body suit.  Ahh!  And made it so that I can't cum at all!  At ALL!&quot;  Cathy was nearly screaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make a deal?  I fix you just right and you let me out of this thing.&quot;  Cathy tried to make a gesture indicating her body but her arms could not bend enough in the restricting plastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Jen agreed.  She could only imagine the torment that Cathy was enduring with her whole body being stimulated to get her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fist, I dare you to miss-hear and fail to notice any sight or mention of Dean's penis or anything related to Dean's penis,&quot; Cathy said before she was cut off by a loud grunt of pleasure.<br />
<br />
The cat beside Jen was trying to say something but Jen could not hear him clearly.  It began thrusting its hips suggestively at Cathy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for your transformation you will regain a normal amount of control over your features and feet, Jen,&quot; Cathy finished before collapsing over backward and writhing on the floor in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Jen's heels hit the floor an instant later.  She felt her face to confirm that the her grin was indeed gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Cathy.  I don't know why you did for me but I can guess.  I don't know why Dean would put you in such a state but I am going to get you out of it right now,&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
Then she turned and walked out of the room to answer the door-bell that rang at that instant.</p>
