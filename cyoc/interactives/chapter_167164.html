<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin&#39;s next class was study hall. Usually, she would just read a book to pass the time, but today she knew she&#39;d have the app to keep her occupied.<br />
<br />
The study hall was a large open room with many windows. It was administered by the school&#39;s vice principal, Jon Simp. Mr. Simp usually paid little attention to the students and mostly focused on his administrative work, so as long as everyone kept quiet and nobody fell asleep the period was rather free form. Erin looked around at the dozen or so students in the room. After a few moments her eyes landed on Abigail Ryan and Martin Green. The two had been dating since middle school. Abigail was a curvy blonde who wore tasteful makeup and dressed neatly. She had nicely tanned skin and carefully manicured hands. Everything about her was neat and orderly. Martin had mussy brown hair. He was skinny and pale, but still managed to have large red cheeks and a mild acne problem. He was into painting and his fingers and cloths often had dried drops of acrylic paint on them. He was sloppy, but in a debonair way rather than a dirty way. <br />
<br />
Erin could overhear snippets of their conversation. It seemed like Abigail was imploring Martin to take better care of the way he looked. <br />
<br />
Erin decided to target Martin and generated a sentence. It read &quot;This boy is discussing his general physical presentation with his girlfriend.&quot; Smirking, Erin changed discussing to swapping. Now Abigail was as pale as Martin was tan. Her clothing fell loosely off of her skinny frame. Meanwhile, Martin&#39;s clothing fit perfectly over his beefy but not quite fat body. Martin ran his perfectly manicured hand through his perfectly groomed blonde hair. &quot;You&#39;re really beautiful, Abby,&quot; he said to her. &quot;I just wish you&#39;d take better care of yourself.&quot; Abigail rolled her eyes and flicked her frizzy brown hair out of her eyes. <br />
<br />
Erin was laughing like crazy. She wondered what the limits of this thing were. And how hard it would work to make absurd sentences work in the new reality. She targeted Mr. Simp and generated a sentence. &quot;The vice-principal is a trying to get paperwork from the track coach.&quot; Mr. Simp had his face buried in his laptop and was typing furiously. Erin knew the track coach, Ms. Chart. She was a younger woman with short black hair. Curious what kind of effect it might have, Erin replaced paperwork with pregnant. She hit confirm. How could a man get pregnant from a woman? Mr. Simp simply vanished, leaving the room without a teacher watching the students. The class changed as other students started chatting loudly and fucking around. Martin and Abigail started making out in the back of the room. Towards the front of the room four nerds were playing dungeons and dragons. <br />
<br />
Warren Quinn was acting as the DM. He was a blubbery obese kid with a wide round face and a squeaky voice. The three other boys playing were Roger Atkins, who was a black kid of moderate height with short curly hair, Douglas Cortez, who was a scrawny but tall awkward kid with deathly pale skin and brown hair, and Billy Barr, who was also obese and whose greasy skin glittered under the classroom lights. They looked like they were having fun. Still experimenting, Erin decided to target the d-20 they were passing around. The sentence said &quot;The player takes a character action each time they roll this die.&quot; She changed it so it read &quot;the player take a character attribute each time they roll this die.&quot; She hit enter and watched, not quite able to hear what they were saying.<br />
<br />
Warren rolled first. His skin turned from pale white to more Arabic in tone, which looked silly given his bright read hair. He passed the dice to Roger, who rolled and then suddenly sprouted hair down to his mid-back. Douglas rolled next, and his brown hair turned blonde. Finally Billy rolled, and amazingly his obese body became fit and well muscled. They continued to play, and Warren suddenly gained large breasts. Roger sprouted a bushy beard. Douglas lost six inches of height. Billy&#39;s greasy skin turned clear.<br />
<br />
Erin let her eyes wander elsewhere. She saw Jenny Lewis chatting with Dana Milbank. She generated a sentence for Jenny. &quot;Jenny Lewis is recounting a sexual experience with her boyfriend to Dana&#39;s great amusement.&quot; Erin changed recounting to reenacting. Like that, Jenny had Dana pinned to the floor, one hand groping Dana&#39;s large breasts, the two fingers knuckle deep in Dana&#39;s pussy. Jenny attacked Dana&#39;s face and neck with kisses. Dana writhed in pleasure. <br />
<br />
Just then the classroom door flew open and a middle-aged woman strutted in. She surveyed the class aghast. &quot;Students, what do you think you&#39;re doing.&quot; Everyone scattered back to their seats and looked ashamed. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it,&quot; the woman said. &quot;I step out for ten minutes to go speak to Mr. Chart and everyone loses their mind? Jenny? What exactly are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ms. Simp,&quot; Jenny muttered, clearly ashamed. Erin noted that her right hand was still slick and dripping with Dana&#39;s pussy juices.<br />
<br />
Erin giggled inside as the class got back into order. So that&#39;s how it had solved the pregnant thing, by gender swapping Mr. Simp and Ms. Chart. That made sense. She looked over at the four boys who had been playing d&d.<br />
<br />
Warren looked nothing like himself, instead he was a sleek, busty arabic princess with elaborately done black hair, large breasts, wide hips, a narrow waist, and a perfect button nose. Warren was dressed in silky billowy clothing that showed off her flat belly. Large earrings dangled from her ears.<br />
<br />
Roger was now nearly seven feet tall, with massive muscles and long black hair and a bushy beard. His black skin was now more tan. He wore only a tattered loincloth made from animal hide. <br />
<br />
Douglas was now barely four feet tall and rotund. He also had a large bushy beard and also a large nose. His belly was large and his head was bald.<br />
<br />
Billy was now very female, with long red hair tied in a ponytail. She dressed in black leather that clung tightly to her body and showed off every curve, including the curves of her labia. She was gorgeous, but she had a killer&#39;s glint in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Erin was amazed at what the dice had done by virtue of her phone app&#39;s magic. Soon, the bell rang and it was time for lunch. <br />
<br />
Erin sauntered off to find Rico.</p>
