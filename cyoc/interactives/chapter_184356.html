<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Holly, can you please look after your brother as me and your dad get things settled in the house?” Her mom insisted, which made Holly annoyed by that request. “Fine, mom.” She replied as she was sitting on the stairs, while looking up stuff on her phone. “Just be sure that your brother doesn’t wander off by himself. I don’t want him getting lost.” Her mom added. “Okay mom. I’m not an idiot.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you sass talk me, young lady.” Her mom tried to discipline her. “Look, I said that I’ll just do it.” Holly got more annoyed. “I get that you’ve been disgruntled with the move we had, and I’m sorry for that. But your brother doesn’t know any better. He’s only two.” Her mother said. “I wouldn’t be here if you just let me go to Six Flags with my friends down in Georgia.” Holly cried out. “Yeah, I know that. But your dad really wanted this job for so many years now.”<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe if you just left me at Mapleboro or let me stay at grandma’s for a couple days, then I would’ve be fine. But you had to drag me here like I don’t mean anything to you.” Holly started to seem furious. “Of course you mean everything to me. It’s just that me and your dad don’t want you to be all alone for a Six Flags trip. I’m sure your friends could understand that before we left.” <br />
<br />
“You know what, mom? Fuck you. Fuck this family. Fuck dad’s bullshit job. Fuck this house. I wish I never was in this family.” Holly yelled at her mother. “That’s it, Holly. Give me your phone.” Skyler said in a sternful voice. “Why? So you can go and tell my friends that you’re a stupid bitch.” “No, because you are grounded for a month for speaking out to me like that.” <br />
<br />
“Ugh. You are such a huge pain sometimes. Maybe I do wish I was alone so I won’t have to deal with all your bullcrap.” Holly retorted. “Since you are willing to continue to talk to your own mother like that, I suggest that you go to your new room now. Your father and I will discuss your punishment in a little bit.” Holly then stormed upstairs, as she was upset that her mom was being so bossy over her.<br />
Holly goes to her new room, which was right next to the bathroom, where she cried since her mom treats her like she’s still a little kid. <br />
<br />
“This isn’t fair at all. I hate how they do this to me. It’s like I don’t even matter to them anymore unless I had to be their little babysitter for Daniel.” She thought to herself as she lied down and continued to cried. This continued for about an hour before everything started to look bigger from her point of view, as her body was shrinking down. Her clothes also rapidly changed as her typical attire was transformed out of nowhere. Within a few seconds, she became the size of a two year old toddler that was as tall as Daniel. Her clothes were replaced with a bright purple shirt with a butterfly on it, along with a Lambies disposable diaper underneath. She also became pudgy as her baby fat was coming back in. <br />
<br />
Her new bedroom also changed, where it had a crib with a few toys inside, along with a changing table that was fully stocked to the left of her dresser. “No, there’s no way this is real. I can’t be a baby again. I must be dreaming.” She closes her eyes and pinches herself, only to find that nothing has changed once she opened them again. “Great, just great. First, I’ve been treated like a little kid, now I’m a baby myself.”<br />
<br />
She then attempts to get out of her room, knowing that she’s curious on what’s going on at this point. “I got to find a way to turn myself back. Hopefully there’s something that I could use downstairs to communicate to somebody.” She thought before going on her to toddle downstairs from the hallway. As she was trying to go downstairs, she heard some childish noises coming from a couple rooms nearby. When she opened the door, she found Daniel and another girl that was wearing a sea blue shirt with an otter on it, along with a diaper underneath. They were playing with a submarine toy, along with plastic animals that were scattered towards where they were playing on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Daniel, where’s mommy?” Holly said as she was concerned with what’s going on. However the girl that was playing with was giggling. “Holly, that is mommy.” Daniel spoke. “Wait what?” She was confused on what was going on. “Yeah, you can’t really tell from how I look, but I’m definitely mommy.” Skyler said happily. “So you aren’t going to punish me after what I said?”<br />
Holly wondered. “Well maybe if you continue on being a naughty girl, but for now I’ll let it slide.” Skyler continued to play with her toys as Holly was relieved from what happened earlier.</p>
