<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laura, Zora, and Cecelia. Hildia&#39;s 3 closest friends from when she was a little girl way back over 1000 years ago. Their arival was almost synchronized as each of them appeared less than 2 seconds from the next. <br />
<br />
The first to arive was Laura. She had a messy bob cut that worked well with her fine, dark brown hair. She had a fairly athletic build but more done for the toned muscle look rather than strength. She had on a crop top/sports bra combo and black leggings that gave her a great looking ass which made up for her generosity dubbed B-cup breasts, she was actually almost completely flat chested though, but no one would make that comment to her face.<br />
<br />
The second which to show up was Cecelia. She was easily 5 inches shorter then the rest, but had made up for it a couple hundred years ago by enchanting her own feet to become a permanent pair of high heeled boots that she could control the appearance of. Today, she was only wearing a comfortable 3 inch heel, so she was still shorter then the others. Her long Black hair had also been done up into an ass length high ponytail that she had styled with her own hair acting as the holder. She was born in what today would be South Korea, but due to certain issues, had fled west and met the rest of them. She had changed her name as well in order to never be found by her past. Even Hildia, the oldest of them all, didn&#39;t know her real birth name. And since a few years ago, she had finally gone back to South Korea, where she became a model.<br />
<br />
The final person to arive was Zora. Zora was... unique, to put it nicely. She liked to combine different styles of clothing together, which usually never worked out too well or too bad for that matter, but just looked odd and out of place. Such as her outfit for today, which was one of her better ideas. She had merged a gray, mermaid style evening gown with a set of sexy lingerie that used a generous amount of black lace and ribbons in an overlapping spiral pattern. Her left boob and just abover her pussy were only covered by the see through lace material. That alone would have been ok, but then when she paired that with her choice of footware, it became odd. Her right leg and foot were encased in a shiny black thigh high platform boot with a 7 inch heel. The split in her dress from where the materials no longer connected made that leg almost always exposed. Her left foot was in the left shoe of a pair of white sandles with the same 7 inch heel. Except she had removed the heel and replaced it with a wheel of all things. To top it all off, she was wearing a dark blue fedora which again, loomed really good with her wavy blonde hair and light blue eyes. But had no connection to the rest of her outfit. Aside from her clothing, Zora was actually one of the hottest women in the room, even more so than Cecelia, who already was hard to beat on her bad days. She always spoke in a rather lofty, slow, almost overly calm and laid back manner at all times, which added to her... uniqueness. However she was by far the nicest one in the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you are looking good Hildia, almost as if you haven&#39;t aged in years&quot; joked Cecelia. <br />
<br />
&quot;At least I didn&#39;t stop growing in height at 14&quot; Hildia quipped back, while giving her a hug. &quot;Its been too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear you have become a teacher, Hildia.&quot; Said Laura. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? How lovely. Will you be sleeping with one of your student again? I find you to be so much, livelier when you have had sex, regularly.&quot; Said Zora in her same slow and aloof manner of speaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I am not!&quot; Shouted Hildia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Zora, she seems pretty lively to me&quot; said Cecilia &quot;what do you think Laura?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree, someone, or something, has definitely gotten her all wound up again&quot; agreed Laura with a nod of her head. &quot;She seems like it at least.&quot; Now Hildia was being stared at by the 3 of them who clearly didn&#39;t believe her. But before she could speak another word to persuade them that she was not sleeping with any of her students, Zora spoke while looking up. &quot;Hmm? Perhaps it is you?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wave of her hand, Charlotte suddenly appeared on the ground in front of them. Laura and Cecelia both covered their mouths in shock while Hildia put her over her eyes, fearing yet another headache would be comming for her in the near future. It was only Zora who remained unphased and approached the sight in front of her. &quot;That look like it would be fun. Maybe I should look for a slime when I return, she pondered out loud to herself while kneeling down next to Charlotte to get a closer look. <br />
<br />
Charlotte, who suddenly appeared in the livingroom was too embarrassed to do literally anything. That was because at this moment, she was tightly bound up by Pussy, whose various tentacles were teasing her nipples and clitoris in a back and fourth circular pattern, while another one was plunged so far into her ass that it came out her mouth and a final one was doing the same, but in reverse. Every part of Charlotte felt good at the moment. Even her insides were bringing her pleasure. Every breath she took was done while shaking in ecstacy simply caused by her lungs moving. <br />
<br />
All of this had redulted from simply asking Pussy to pleasurer her. She had not expected that Pussy would then begin excreting an aphrodisiac-like mucus and rub it in every nook and corner of her body until her entire being was one large erogenous zone with the same sensitivity level as her clit.<br />
<br />
Zora took out an empty vial and began scooping up some of the excess, pink colored mucus into it. After collecting enough of it. She gave it a sniff, tossed in some gray colored powder that she had stored on her person somewhere. After stiring them together until the mucus was much more waterlike in its viscosity, she poured it into Charlotte&#39;s mouth. Allowing her to properly breath once again as well as cause Pussy to retract all of her tentacles back inside of Charlotte&#39;s pussy. After that, Pussy too returned back inside of Charlotte&#39;s womb for now. The aphrodisiac&#39;s effects were all but gone too. Zora held out a hand and helped Charlotte up to her feet before giving her a proper once over look from head to toe. <br />
<br />
&quot;May I keep this?&quot; She said to Hildia while pointing to Charlotte. &quot;She seems like a lot of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you cannot keep my daughter. She stays here.&quot; <br />
&quot;Mmm, it can&#39;t be helped I guess.&quot; shrugged Zora. That didnt stop her from stitting down while forcing Charlotte to sit down next to her though. <br />
<br />
&quot;When did you get a daughter? Whose her Father even? Do we know him?&quot; Exclaimed both Cecelia and Laura. <br />
<br />
&quot;She is adopted. And while I am at it... Charlotte, this is Laura, Cecelia, and Zora. You guys, this is my daughter Charlotte&quot; introduce Hildia.<br />
<br />
Cecelia was the first to act and moved over  to in front of Charlotte. &quot;Wow, your really pretty. Ever consider being a model before? I would gladly take you in as my appearance. Here&#39;s my card, just give me a call if you ever are in Seoul. We could hangout and I could show you around my agency&#39;s studio. Maybe we could even do a mini photo shoot too with just us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey no fair, you should instead come and work in my fitness center. With your looks, I guarantee that you would quickly become a huge hit. Maybe even a star on social media.&quot; Now Laura was getting into it too.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is your slime&#39;s name?&quot; asked Zora. &quot;If I were to name it, I would have call it nutmeg, or pussy, or maybe george.&quot; Charlotte had to turn her head after hearing that Zora would have named the female slime George. But then answered her with a bit of excitement. &quot;I called her Pussy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A wonderfully fitting name since she&#39;s living inside of your pussy right?&quot; Inquired Zora. Charlotte&#39;s expression lit up in delight. &quot;Exactly. And it is a perfect name for her because she is all pink and moist too.&quot; Zora slowly nodded. &quot;A truely great name. It kind of reminds me of a pet rock golem that I use to own. I also had named her Pussy.&quot; Now all 4 of you were looking at Zora, as the mental image of her pregnant with a rock golem floated into your heads, causing Laura to even cringe a bit at the thought of trying to fit something that huge inside of her. &quot;I loved her a lot. Did you know that I had named him after my first pet that I ever had? It was a cat, her name was Stoney.&quot; Continued Zora, not being able to read the atmosphere that the room had taken.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-anyways... ahem... anyways, I asked you ladies to come her in order to ask you all for advice. Charlotte, this is not for you to hear, so would you mind returning to your room for a while?&quot; Charlotte agrees, and after saying goodbye to the others, and recieving another potion from Zora that will neutralize the aphrodisiac, starts to head back upstairs into her room, when Cecelia calls after her. &quot;Oh! Hang on a second, I have something for you to try out.&quot; Cecelia takes out a dark blue crystal which then begins to glow bright once she touches it. She tossed it over to Charlotte who caught it. However the moment it contacted her skin, instead of glowing, the crystal just turned into powder. And fell to the floor. Not only Cecelia, but Laura, and even Hildia as well had a wide eyed expression of disbelief. Zora was the only one smiling while laughing happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot; asked Charlotte. &quot;Not at all, um, by the way, how old are you anyways?&quot; <br />
&quot;20&quot;<br />
&quot;Twenty? As in two zero? Two times ten? That twenty? Not 20 thousand, or 20 hundreds? You really are just only twenty?&quot; Cecelia turns towards Hildia and mouths the words &quot;How the fuck is she only twenty??&quot;. Hildia nods in agreement. Cecelia turns back towards Charlotte. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it to much, honey, it was just a bad prank is all. No worries ok.&quot; Charlotte decides to buy into her obvious bluff and just leaves the situation behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am certainly surprised Hilda&quot; says Laura once they confirm that Charlotte is out of earshot. &quot;She has enough raw power to turn a tier 6 crystal to literal powder just on contact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously where on earth did you find her?&quot; inquired Cecelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she has such an adorable little slime too&quot; added Zora. &quot;It makes me sort of wish I had one as well. The slime I mean, not a daughter. Although I wouldn&#39;t mind taking yours in Hildia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not happening. She is mine.&quot; Said Hildia rather defensively. &quot;Well aren&#39;t you becoming quite the protective Mother&quot; Laura then laughed at her own joke, which lightened the mood. Cecelia turned towards Hildia and offered her every assistance she could provide. Laura and Zora also agreed right after.</p>
