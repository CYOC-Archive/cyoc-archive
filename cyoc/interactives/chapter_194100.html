<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James dragged himself into his apartment, worn out from another overnight shift at the convenience store. His live just had not been great the last few years, having lost his job in programming the only thing he could find and keep was working as an assistant manager dishing out cigarettes and energy drinks to other poor bastards having to work night shifts. He had to give up his small, but cozy single bedroom apartment for this only slightly bigger but three bedroom he shared with two other guys. Luckily, they both had day jobs, so except for the occasional day where their days off aligned, he usually had the place to himself. His only comfort. The place also looked like three single guys lived there.<br />
<br />
Worse. Today James was in a particularly foul mood. It was his birthday, which always felt like it was there just to mark another year of being a failure. Thirty-five and nothing to show for it but a bank account he couldn&#39;t get over four-digits and a scale he couldn&#39;t get under two hundred. He used to have energy for the gym, not anymore. Now to mention skin pale from only being out at night and messy black hair that might slowly be retreating up his forehead. He went to the fridge and pulled out a drink, popping the top of the soda and taking a chug. Maybe he should go get himself a cupcake like those cheesy movies where the person has to spend their birthday alone but their wish comes true. <br />
<br />
&quot;Psshhh.. Bullshit.&quot; His folks might call later, probably around noon when he was trying to sleep. They never could remember he worked nights now. Might call, if they remembered. He was about to head back to his room to lose himself in video games for a couple hours before crashing only to be stopped by a knock on the door. He headed back over and yanked it open, ready to berate anyone who might be brazen enough to bother him.<br />
<br />
Standing in the hallway was a delivery guy. With his slightly too tight uniform and well built frame, James idly wondered if someone had jokingly sent him a male stripper for his birthday. The guy looked the part, he should be a model not a postman. &quot;Packages are supposed to be left at the office, man.&quot; James said, a yawn stalling him halfway through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Certified. Needs a signature.&quot; He held out the small package and flashed too straight, white teeth in a winning smile. James had the weird feeling he had seen this guy before somewhere. Maybe in the flood of customers in his memory. James took the package and then the pen to sign the man&#39;s clipboard, wondering what one of his roomies had ordered. &quot;Have a good one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.. you too.&quot; James was just about to throw the package on the counter and resume his plan of videogames until the name on the small box caught his eye. It was addressed to him. He looked it over. The return address was just a PO Box with no name. He leaned up against the counter as he popped open the box. Nestled inside in a small bit of padding was another box, square and flat, wrapped in glittery &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; wrapping paper. Someone had remembered. Unless this was just his parents&#39; yearly gift card. Maybe his sister had deigned to send him a gift this year.<br />
<br />
He tore the paper open and tossed it aside, opening he black velour box underneath. Inside sat a silver necklace, a plain chain with a dangling pendant. He picked it up to take a closer look. It looked like the, what was that famous da Vinci sketch called? &quot;The vitruvian man.&quot; He muttered. It looked like that just with an infinity symbol behind it. &quot;Weird.&quot; He pulled the necklace free and a card fell out of the box onto the counter top.<br />
<br />
James plucked the card and flipped it over. It looked like it had been printed out on an old type writer, the card was even a bit yellowed.<br />
<br />
THE NECKLACE OF INFINITE LIVES<br />
<br />
Wear me to sleep and you will wake to a new life. Leave me off and live the life another day.<br />
When you find the life you wish to have, pass me on to someone who needs me.<br />
<br />
James scoffed. So, someone thought he needed a new life. Well. They weren&#39;t wrong. But some silly new age necklace wasn&#39;t going to solve his problems. He put the necklace and card back in the box, bringing it back to his room with him. He still wanted to play some video games.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
James set the controller aside, shoving his fist over his mouth to stifle another yawn. He was getting good match ups for once, something he usually didn&#39;t get during the day, but sleep could only be put off for so long if he didn&#39;t want to be a zombie the next morning. He stood up and peeled off his clothing, tossing them on the chair where he kept his dirty but not dirty enough he couldn&#39;t wear it again clothes. Except his underwear, that went into the hamper which was getting full. He&#39;d need to go hit up the laundry room on his next day off.<br />
<br />
As he laid down in bed he remembered the necklace. It sat on the table next to his bed in its box. &quot;Ah, what the hell.&quot; He grabbed the box and opened it up, then pulled the piece of jewelry over his head. The pendant felt fool against his skin as it landed against is slightly hairy chest. &quot;Let&#39;s see what new age mumbo jumbo you can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
He fell back into his pillows, and after about thirty minutes of staring off into space he finally drifted off.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
James woke to no alarm. He wasn&#39;t surprised, after so many months of the same schedule he usually woke up before he needed to. He pushed back the covers and sat up, letting his feet hit the floor. He pushed himself up and almost toppled over. It took him a moment to find his balance. He plodded towards the door to the bathroom. His bedroom didn&#39;t attach to the apartment bathroom, but he felt like this was right. That door was the bathroom, the other was the walk-in closet.<br />
<br />
He entered the bathroom, tile cool on his bare feet and up to the double vanity. Turning on the water he cupped his hands under the faucet, then washed the sleep from his eyes. He grabbed a hand towel off the wall and dried his face, then finally looked up in the mirror, and almost jumped out of his skin.<br />
<br />
Except it wasn&#39;t his skin. But he was definitely wearing it. For one, it was a different color. His skin was a deep brown, and his face was all different, too, with a broad nose and full lips, a strong jaw with a short, neatly trimmed bears and a head full of short braided dreadlocks. He lowered the towel and stood up straighter to get a better look in the mirror. He was almost as well built as the delivery guy yesterday. Prominent pectorals tipped with nipples even darker than the rest of his skin between which sat the necklace, a stomach the pulled into a tight six pack. Stubble on his chest and stomach from where it have been shaved smooth. Powerful arms, thick with well worked biceps and triceps. A trim narrow waist above legs that did not skip leg day, and in between.<br />
<br />
James let out a soft whistle as he hefted the package between his legs. His hand was larger, rough and calloused, but he couldn&#39;t get his fingers to close around his rapidly hardening cock. It must have been ten inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you know the rules. If you need to get off in the morning I get first offer.&quot; The voice was amused, with a slight central American accent. James looked up to see the speaker standing in the doorway, as nude as he was. He was leaner though, with deep tan skin and wavy black hair down to his shoulders, a bit of stubble on his jaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot; James asked, his own voice was a deep, rich baritone to his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m your husband, mi amor.&quot; Juan teased, stepping in close to wrap his hand around James&#39; cock. Juan. He knew that man&#39;s name was Juan. His eyes flicked to his left hand to the golden band around his ring finger. Juan must have noticed James&#39; awkwardness, as his tone became a bit more serious. &quot;Everything alright, Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty, that was his name. Not James. He could remember being James, but he was also remembering being Ty. &quot;Sorry, hon. Just a little out of sorts this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe this will help.&quot; Juan reached into the shower and turned it on, then backed into it, pulling Ty along by the grip he held on his cock. Ty followed eagerly, and under the hot water began to explore his husband&#39;s increasingly familiar body with his hands. He soon had Juan pushed up against the tile wall, legs around his waist, held up by powerful arms as he plunged his cock into a hole that almost seemed to be made for him. Ty lost himself in the simultaneously new and familiar sensations of making love to this man, and enjoying every moment of it as the hot water cascaded over him. Maybe the necklace wasn&#39;t new age bunk after all.</p>
