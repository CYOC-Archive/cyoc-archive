<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Colin and Brian arrive at Colin’s home they find April sitting in the living room, “mistress, I brought a friend,” Colin says, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
Brian smiles kindly at the 10-year-old girl, “so, you are the owner of this well behaved dog,” he asks.<br />
<br />
April smiles back, “I sure am,” she says, “it took some hard training, but it really was worth it,” she continues, “what can I do for you, sir?”<br />
<br />
“Please, call me Brian,” the man says, “I’m here to ask if you’d want me to vaccinate and chip Colin. According to him he hasn’t been vaccinated and chipped yet, but he has to be”.<br />
<br />
April thinks for a while, she then grins, ‘having Colin chipped and vaccinated would be so hilarious,’ she thinks to herself, ‘he’d officially become a “dog”, at least on paper’. The girl then nods, “yeah, I haven’t got round to have it done yet,” she says, “how much would it cost?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, for you and because your dog is such a good boy, I’ll won’t charge you,” Brian says.<br />
<br />
April’s eyes widen, “really, that’s so kind of you,” she says.<br />
<br />
“It’ll be my pleasure, young lady,” Brian says, “may I ask how old you are?”<br />
<br />
April is a little surprised at the man’s question, everyone else can tell that she’s 10. April assumes, because of her breasts being a little larger than the average 10-year-old, that Brian is just confused. ‘I’ll have a little fun with him,’ the girl thinks to herself, ‘what’s the worst that could happen?’<br />
<br />
April smiles up at Brian, “I am 18,” she says.<br />
<br />
Brian’s eyes widen in surprise, “seriously,” he asks, “you look more like 10!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I get that a lot,” April says, “but I don’t mind at all,” the girl then sighs as she continues with the lie, “the only down part is that I can’t be with anyone, even though I am 18, any man who’d date me would get into serious trouble”.<br />
<br />
Brian is silent for a while, ‘she is really stunning,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I had a feeling that she is older than she looks, I’m glad that my feeling was correct, because, if she were in fact 10, she wouldn’t be talking like a young adult and more like a stupid brat. She’s exactly the type of woman I am attracted to, I got to play this smartly and with the help of the App I have discovered today, I won’t have to worry getting into trouble with the law’.<br />
<br />
April, unaware of what Brian is thinking, smiles up at the man, who is at least 30-years-old, “so, are you gonna do your thing,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Brian blinks, he then grins a little sheepishly, “sorry, madame,” he says, “I was kind of zoned out for a second”.<br />
<br />
Being called “madame” causes April to feel weird, but in a good way, the 10-year-old feels somewhat proud of being not treated as a little kid, “oh, please, call me April,” she says.<br />
<br />
Brian smiles, “it is a pleasure, April,” he says, “and what a beautiful name! Now, let me go grab the things I need from my van,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Brian, by the way, is a really attractive man, he has a nice athletic body, short hazelnut-brown hair styled in an undercut, a fair skin tone and dark cornflower blue eyes. As Brian walks to his van, he takes out his phone and opens the App, ‘after I’m done with Colin, April will be mine,’ he thinks to himself as he activates the scanner.<br />
<br />
By the time Brian reaches his van the scanning process completes, the man opens April’s file and immediately scrolls down to the girl’s breast size, not paying attention to her age, which the App shows to be 10 and not 18 as she claims. Brian smiles when he sees that April’s breast size is a nice 34B, ‘perfect, not to big and not to small,’ he thinks to himself. The man then scrolls further to April’s “attracted to” section, Brian noticing that April seems to be attracted towards males with athletic bodies, grinning, the 30-year-old deletes that information and replaces it with “Brian Mason”. Next Brian checks to see if April is fertile, his grin smiles when he sees that she is still a virgin but not fertile, not wanting to cause April pain, Brian causes April’s hymn to have broken due to exercise and changes the girl’s fertile percentage from 0% to 100%, ‘it’s about time I become a daddy,’ he thinks to himself. After confirming the changes, Brian opens the reality alteration option and edits it so that he won’t get into trouble for April appearing so young. Satisfied, Brian closes the App and puts it into his jeans, before grabbing the stuff he needs to vaccinate, chip and register the “dog”.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back in the house, April suddenly feels a little weird, “I must say,” she says, “Brian sure is one hell of a handsome guy. I do love the way his body appears to be so athletic, his muscles are perfectly formed”.<br />
<br />
Colin nods, “yeah, honestly I can see you two dating and creating a family, mistress,” he says.<br />
<br />
Hearing this causes April to smile, “that would be lovely, but… I doubt he’d want to date me. I mean… I’m only 10 and not in the legal age, sadly, my mind is! But my body isn’t,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t think Brian would mind,” Colin says, “the way he looked at you, I mean… I am only a dog, but even I can tell that he finds you really attractive. Besides, what counts is your mental age, it shouldn’t be a big deal if your body doesn’t match your age. I have a feeling that no one will mind you dating Brian, I also believe that he’d be a great father!”<br />
<br />
April smiles at her “dog”, “you really are the best, Colin,” she says, “thanks for supporting and being there for me!”<br />
<br />
Colin smiles and wags his tail, “and that will never change, mistress,” he says, walking up to April and licking her cheek.<br />
<br />
“Eeeew! Doggy slobber,” April giggles.<br />
<br />
Colin blushes and grins sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head, “he… sorry,” he says.<br />
<br />
April ruffles Colin’s hair, “all good, pup,” she says, “we’ll see what will happen”.<br />
<br />
Just then Brian returns, “okay, I’ve got everything we need,” he says, “Colin, would you please come here? We’ll start with the vaccination!”<br />
<br />
Colin nods and walks over to where Brian has set up his equipment, “where will you inject the vaccination?”<br />
<br />
“In your butt,” Brian simply states.<br />
<br />
“Nye… I hope I’ll still be able to sit,” Colin says, frowning.<br />
<br />
Brian chuckles as he gets the combined injection ready, “don’t worry,” he says, “it may hurt a little, but that will decrease after a few minutes, after that the area will itch a little, but it should all be over in an hour”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Colin says.<br />
<br />
“Good, hold still,” Brian says, Colin yelps when the needle penetrates his butt, he then can feel the vaccination flow into his body, “good boy,” Brian says, removing the syringe and giving Colin a treat.<br />
<br />
“That hurt,” Colin whines, but wags his tail when Brian praises him.<br />
<br />
“It’ll be fine in a few minutes,” Brian says, picking up the chipping-gun, “now for the chip”.<br />
<br />
Colin winces when he feels a painful sting, almost like a bee-sting, between his shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
Brian puts down the gun and grabs a small white box, which he moves over the area of Colin’s back, the box giving off a peeping sound. “The chip is activated and you are officially registered in the national pet registration system,” Brian says, smiling, “it has all your information, like address, the name of your owner, your age”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Colin says, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
“How old do you think he is,” April says.<br />
<br />
“I’d guess he’s a year old,” Brian says, “which would make him around 15 in human years”.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” Colin says, “hehe… I am a big boy,” he then adds, wagging his tail and puffing out his chest proudly.<br />
<br />
Brian chuckles, “you sure are, but you are also a very GOOD boy,” he says.<br />
<br />
“You know… I’m curious what type of breed he is,” April says, “it is hard to tell because he is so unique”.<br />
<br />
Brian tilts his head, “judging by his size and personality, I’d say he’d be equal with a Malinois, which is a Belgian Shepherd, those dogs are super smart, agile, fast and have a strong “need to protect” instinct,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess I’m a Malinois then,” Colin says, “though I’d love to look the part, I mean, it’s cool being unique, but I would love to at least look less human. I can still talk and walk on two legs, it’s just that, having no fur is pretty uncomfortable, especially when the temperature is low”.<br />
<br />
‘Hm… maybe I should transform him into an Anthro Malinois with beautiful black fur,’ April thinks to herself, ‘I’ll need to think it over though, I’ll decide in the morning’.<br />
<br />
“Well, my job is done,” Brian says, packing his things away, “I’d better get home, it’s been a long and tiring day”.<br />
<br />
“Um…,” April says, “wh-why don’t you stay overnight,” she asks, blushing, her eyes roaming over Brian’s body, stopping at his crotch, the girl not noticing as she licks her lips.<br />
<br />
Brian, however, does notice, the man smirks inwardly, ‘looks like it worked,’ he thinks to himself, “only if it’s not a big deal,” he then says, “I really don’t want to intrude”.<br />
<br />
April shakes her head, still staring at Brian’s crotch, “n-no, of course it’s not a big deal,” she says, “it’s… it’s the least I can do to thank you for everything you have done”.<br />
<br />
Brian smiles, “in that case, I’d be happy to spend the night,” he says, “I can sleep on the couch”.<br />
<br />
“Um… I… I wouldn’t mind you… sharing a bed with me,” April says, blushing hard.<br />
<br />
Brian grins inwardly, “oh? Looks like some one wants to be close to me,” he says, chuckling, “do you find me attractive?”<br />
<br />
“I… yes,” April says.<br />
<br />
Brian smiles, stepping closer to April, “and I find you really attractive,” he says, stopping a few inches in front of April, the 4’ 7’’ “tall” girl shyly looking up at the 30-year-old, who is 5’ 6’’.<br />
<br />
The two just look at each other for a while, April stares up at Brian, his beautiful blue cornflower eyes seeming to sparkle, the girl feels as though she is in trance, unable to look away, and before she realizes it, Brian had leaned down and planted his lips against hers, next thing April knows is that she feels the man’s arms wrap around her, holding her close. April’s eyes widen in surprise and shock, but it feels so right to her that she just wraps her arms around Brian and soon the two are passionately kissing each other.<br />
<br />
Brian breaks the kiss, “god, you are… a great kisser,” he says, “even though you’re unexperienced”.<br />
<br />
April blushes and giggles, “I guess I just know how it is done properly, even without having ever kissed someone like that,” she says, the 10-year-old lies a hand on Brian’s chest, biting her lower lip, “why don’t we head to the… bedroom, Brian,” she asks with a sly and cheeky grin, her face red from blushing.<br />
<br />
Brian grins, “lead the way, babe,” he says, “time we get to know each other a lot… closer”.</p>
