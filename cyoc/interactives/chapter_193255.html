<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a strange week for Jeff. It was odd having his best friend for a cock, especially since Jeff couldn’t tell how much Dean was really experiencing. He hadn’t heard a peep out of his new cock since that first day, although he figured his friend must be experiencing something because Jeff noticed his libido was on another level. Every morning Jeff would wake up with morning wood so fierce it was almost painful, however, jerking himself off to relieve it was unlike his previous orgasms; they were so intense and all-consuming now, as if he were experiencing Dean’s orgasm as well. He’d often get hard during the day, while in class, on the bus, eating dinner with his parents. As if Dean had a mind of his own on some level and didn’t want to be forgotten. <br />
<br />
School hadn’t been the same that week either; his best friend was absent, no one seemed to remember who Dean was or if he even existed. He missed having his friend in class, and after school as well. Sure, Jeff was happy to lay in bed and stroke his thick, eight-inch cock for hours, but he missed doing other things with Dean as well. Over the course of the week Jeff had gradually begun doing less and less outside of school beyond just laying in bed, jerking off. Stroking his thick cock, feeling Dean pulse and throb in his hand as he pleasured them both, it was the only way he had left to connect. By the end of the week, Jeff was glad to be getting his friend back, even if it meant getting his shorter cock back as well.<br />
<br />
It was down to the last ten minutes now; Jeff reclined on his desk chair, using both hands to stroke Deans pulsing length while also caressing his heavy, churning balls. Dean felt hard as a steel pipe in Jeff’s fingers; he continued jerking his long shaft and used his other hand to twist and manipulate the head, moaning despite himself at the pleasure he was feeling. He had been edging himself for the last hour, trying to make his friend’s last orgasm as a cock as good and memorable for the both of them as he could muster. Dean felt hard and ready to finally blow his load, their balls begging for release. Jeff eyed the count-down timer on the computer screen: still five minutes left to go. His mind raced through a flurry of images and scenarios as he practically fucked his fists trying to reach his release. He thought of all the cute girls at school he’d had eyes on, remembering Jessica Standish from his math class, when they and that douche from the football team Kevan Harris had been working on a group project. An image of Kevan came fresh to mind, and suddenly his cock throbbed and his stroking grew faster. Jeff couldn’t help but think of the strong young man’s muscled arms, his well-developed chest and the handsome beard that had just this year started to grow in. It brought Jeff over the edge; he groaned and let out a deep breath as Dean erupted and spasmed in his hands, their balls pumping out several heavy loads of cum onto Jeff’s slightly hairy stomach. After he had a moment to come back to his senses, Jeff wondered why he’d thought of his male schoolmate just before his orgasm. He was straight, he’d never had a sexual thought about a man before, not that he had a problem with anyone who did. But even in his post-orgasmic state, thinking about Kevan again made his softening cock stir for a moment. His cock…Jeff was wondering if Dean had anything to do with it when suddenly his computer chimed to signal that Dean’s week-long adventure as a cock was now over.<br />
<br />
Jeff groaned as his cock began to grow again, the head and shaft expanding as a pair of limbs budded and grew. The foreskin began to retract as Dean’s pink, mushroom shape head began to revert back to its normal form. Jeff’s urethra repositioned itself as Deans mouth, hair and teeth growing in as his neck reappeared. <br />
<br />
“Oh, shit,” Dean coughed and groaned as he regained his vocal chords, clutching his belly with his newly formed hand as he felt his inner cock anatomy transform back into bones and organs. Dean’s balls became solid and bony as well as they elongated back into legs. As Dean grew and expanded from Jeff’s crotch, his shaft-body regrew its abs and pectoral muscles as the veins faded. Dean grunted as he felt Jeff’s original cock separate from his body, though still it was lodged inside his ass. Both men relaxed as the last of the changes gripped them. Jeff rested a hand on his friends lower back, looking down at where his original, seven-inch cock disappeared into Dean’s soft, tight asshole. <br />
<br />
“Oh, my god, Dude, pull out, pull out,” he moaned. Jeff chuckled but reluctantly pulled his cock free from Dean’s ass. His friend fell forward off of Jeff’s lap and onto the ground, still taking deep breaths and not bothering to pick himself up.<br />
<br />
“You okay, bro?” Jeff asked, examining his old cock.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Dean said, after a minute. “Fuck, man. That was intense.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Jeff laughed. “Were you…aware, the whole time?”<br />
<br />
Dean pushed himself up so he could sit. “Yeah, but I could only hear and see what you could hear and see. And I couldn’t talk to you, or you couldn’t hear me when I did. But, I could hear you talk out loud.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, so what was it like?”<br />
<br />
“Honestly?” Dean wiped his mouth, “It was a little boring. I mean, when I wasn’t getting used to piss or when you weren’t jerking off, I was just hanging around in your pants, doing jack. Orgasms are intense, though, when you’re just a cock.”<br />
<br />
“I kept getting hard, like, all the time. Was that you?” Jeff asked him.<br />
<br />
Dean blushed. “I had to get your attention somehow.”<br />
<br />
“Which reminds me,” Jeff began, uncertain. “When I was jerking…us…off, for some reason that guy from the football team, Kevan Harris came to mind, and you got like super hard in my hands and I came right there,” Jeff laughed nervously, all of it sounding so weird to him when he said it aloud. “And I got to thinking, are you gay, man?”<br />
<br />
Dean didn’t say anything, only sat there on Jeff’s floor like a deer in head lights.<br />
<br />
“It’s cool if you are, man. You’re my bro! Just, you never talk about it.”<br />
<br />
Dean looked at the ground and bit his lip before saying, “I dunno man. I know Kevan is a total tool, but hes…hot. Girls are kind of hot too, I don’t know.” He blushed again. “I know I kind of enjoyed being your cock,” he confessed.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Jeff was surprised. Maybe his own cock, but he wouldn’t be interested in being some other guys cock.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, dude. It was fun. All warm and cozy in your underwear, waking up in the mornings hard and horny, waiting for you to stroke me off and make me bust. It was kind of hot, depending on you for my pleasure.”<br />
<br />
“Like, the ultimate cock-cage,” Jeff laughed, and Dean laughed too, both boys looking away awkwardly. “Would you be up to be my cock again?” he asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
Dean’s eyes lit up. “Yes! But I want to be able to communicate this time, so we can talk and its not always so boring.”<br />
<br />
Jeff agreed, turning to his computer. “And we should change the schedule too. Instead of a week it should be….”<br />
<br />
“A month,” Dean blurted out before covering his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Really? You wanna be a cock for a month?” Jeff asked, incredulous. <br />
<br />
“Why not? The chronivac put my whole life on hold for a week; when I change back it’ll be like I was never even gone.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff laughed, not wanting to argue. He set the parameters, making sure that Dean could mentally communicate with Jeff whenever either of them wanted. However, Jeff did add a few other parameters, like the ability for Dean to see and hear on his own even without eyes or ears. He also made it so that he could hide thoughts and feelings from Dean or even silence his friend if he wanted, just in case. Jeff made sure the world’s awareness was off so that Dean would be unmissed during his “vacation” before hitting enter.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shit,” Dean said, feeling the change begin. “We’re doing this now.”<br />
<br />
“I missed having you where you belong, mate,” Jeff grinned, his cock growing hard again as Dean automatically switched to all fours and presented his ass to Jeff. Jeff was happy to lean back and let the chronivac drive his body, his hand reaching for his cock of its own volition to guide it into Dean’s eager hole.<br />
<br />
“This might be a bit loaded, since I’m balls-deep inside of you,,” said Jeff, as he watched Deans arms begin to slip way, his legs drawing up into balls again, “But you’re always my best bud, whether you’re gay, straight, a man, or my big fat cock,” he said, stroking Dean’s back. Dean and Jeff moaned, both men sharing the pleasure as their nerves and flesh joined together.<br />
<br />
“Thanks bro,” Dean rushed to say as he felt his teeth disappear. “That mean’s a lot,” he finished, before his mouth moved to the top of his spongy, pink head as his neck thickened and grew a foreskin. Dean’s cock-body began to settle into its proper size and shape just as his balls finished forming. Jeff leaned back in his chair and folden his arms, staring down at his friend, hard and throbbing as he rested on Jeff’s chest.<br />
<br />
“Can you hear me?” a voice in Jeff’s mind said.<br />
<br />
“Dean! Yup, loud and clear, buddy.” Jeff thought back, reaching down to give his friend a welcome-back stroke. <br />
<br />
“Damn, that feels so good. How do I look?” Dean asked.<br />
<br />
“Like a big fat cock, you look great, buddy,” Jeff said out loud with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Damn, I can see it in your mind.” Dean said, his head flaring. “I do look good. Keep stroking me, man.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was happy to oblige. He moved to the bed to find a more comfortable position to spend the next few hours. It was going to be an interesting month.</p>
