<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tammy’s first order of business would be clothes after going through her former male attire she only found a few pieces that fit her smaller frame and out of those fewer still complimented her new found feminine taste. Luckily Molly knew a store where she could trade her old clothes for store credit to purchase new ones and other feminine products that she would need. Ever since TG soda become popular more stores were allowing mass trade in for newly transformed people. So Tammy found some old shopping bags and piled in all her old possessions. She threw in all the boxers, socks, jeans, belts, shirts, jackets, and shoes, the only items of worth she found were some gender neutral colored t-shirts which she planned to use only as sleep wear. But that wasn’t the only thing was planning on ridding. Once she was sorted with her former wardrobe she searched her apartment for any trace of Thomas’s life she was going to have a new life and she didn’t need reminders of the one she escaped. The furniture was alright it just plain boring stuff Thomas got for cheap nothing that really said MAN. What she did find were smaller things old sport magazines, exercise weights, men dating tips advice books, men hygiene supplies even the phone case was thrown away but most importantly Tammy got rid of every picture of Thomas she could find. Not just physical photos but online pictures clearing out all the photo galleries of her phone and laptop, she even deleted all the social media accounts she once formerly had to help completely erase Thomas’ existence she would later on trade in her phone and laptop for new ones just to be safe. Once The apartment was thoroughly scrubbed of all traces Tammy and Molly started out to New Style the store Molly mentioned. Tammy had to wear some of the old male clothes she had what little she could tolerate, an old pair of shrunk jeans, one of the tees she planned to keep and some worn out sneakers. Once they reached New Style it took Molly dragging her heels to keep Tammy from running like a mad woman to the trade in desk. At the moment Tammy got her credit Molly was shocked to see her head to the one place she thought she would avoid the women underwear aisle little did Molly knew Tammy was going commando the entire trip over. They first found two packets of panties that seem to best fit her and then they measured Tammy’s breasts so they knew what size bra to get that would be most comfortable. Amazingly Tammy had actually underestimated her bust size what she thought was a regular C cup was in reality a D cup. Once measured Tammy tried many different styles of bra to see which she like best, she even tried a corset they had there which to no one’s surprise she threw away without a second thought. After more than half hour of trying Tammy was set on three types a set of plain bras for common use, a set of sports bras for comfort and exercise and finally a set of fancier style for special occasions. Tammy also got a full set of black lace lingerie which she hoped she would use soon. After getting underwear Tammy went a buzzing seeing all the different styles of women’s clothing after being stifled by the narrow view of men’s fashion she at awe of the many exciting designs and trends. Same as with bras Tammy tried many different styles with varying levels of approval luckily Molly was there to help make sure she got the most essential pieces. In the end of a two hour long shopping spree Tammy manage to create a whole new wardrobe for herself. For comfort and exercise she mainly got t-shirts, tank tops and shorts, as for working attire she got a multitude of different blouses in many different colors in both long and short sleeve, she also got a few dress shirts with a feminine suit jacket, for leg wear she got only skirts avoiding long pants as if they were the plague finding them to reminding of her former life, as of the types of skirts she got mostly causal style ones but a varied none the less in pleated, straight and wavy types and both long and short of various degrees, due the number of skirts Tammy got Molly thought prudently to have her get some stockings mainly in just skin tone and black colors. After that came Tammy’s favorite part dresses which took up half of there shopping time but due to their limited credit Tammy was only able to get four, three sundresses of various colors and patterns and a red-black evening dress hybrid that would be used for more formal use. Then came shoes which took shorter than expected as after choosing her clothing style Tammy had a good idea what are footwear was going to be. It come to be that Tammy got a pair of white sneakers, a pair of heeled sandals, a pair of small heeled dress shoes, a pair of black heeled boots and a pair of red formal wear heels. Also while Tammy and Molly were at New Style they managed to get some cold weather jackets, make up, a purse and new feminine hygiene products to replace the ones Tammy got rid of. At end of their massive shopping trip all they had to pay thanks to their credit was $50 which Molly was willing to cover as a gift in joining the other side. As they left the store Tammy immediately took the blue floral sundress, the heeled sandals, a pair of panties, a bra and make up then entered a public restroom not far away. As Molly piled the clothes in her car Tammy quickly changed clothes throwing the jeans and old sneakers in the trash once she was done then after a short online tutorial she started applying make up through use of the bathroom mirror. When Tammy finally left the restroom Molly was absolutely shocked to see the a young beautiful healthy woman enter the wider world with the largest smile she has ever seen, although she saw her be a woman it entirely different experience see her friend a man truly become the feminine creature that stood before her now. After the reveal of the true Tammy they decided they should officially make Tammy a real person heading to the licensing department to formally recognize Tammy as a woman. Since TG soda this process has become a lot more streamlined service, it still took Tammy an hour to see a clerk though then another hour to fill all the nonsense paperwork and finally Tammy gave her fingerprints to confirm her identity and Molly gave a witness report. The clerk told them that Tammy should receive all her new identities and the government would recognize Tammy by the end of the month. By the time Tammy returned home the only thought she had was life could only go up if today was anything to compare her future to and she was correct. As the month went by Tammy reintroduced herself to her sister Emily who couldn’t be more supportive of her new sister’s choice sadly by this point both of their parents had died so Tammy only had to reintroduce herself to Emily, Thomas didn’t hold anyone close except Emily and Molly. Tammy decided that she would go back to college once your identity was approved since Thomas was so foolish to leave to go for that stupid newspaper job that clearly just poached college students for cheap writers. By the time her identity was approved Tammy had already sent applications to local colleges, scholarships, grants and part-time jobs she was not going to ruin her chances at a better life. It didn’t take long for an acceptance letters from the most prestigious college and most lucrative scholarships and grants. She then started the first semester with a part time job at a book store. As Tammy made good progress in her studies she also made a couple of new life decisions. Tammy had joined a gym and visited at once a week to workout, Thomas had started to treat his body as a garbage disposal before Tammy now she was not going to let that happen again from now on her body was a temple. She also made dietary changes avoiding junk food and eating more healthier food including fish, vegetables and nuts. Tammy had also joined the college newspaper and a book club for fun, making new friends and finding new interests. These including swimming and volleyball which she does one every workout, learning to cook to help make her new diet more easily attainable and has started reading more important texts including journalist articles, philosophy biography and history while still enjoying the cheesy romance and fantasy books. Her job at the book turned out to have done a lot of good for her helping supply her new reading habits and giving her a source of income to spoil herself on. Some of these spoils being new clothes for stuff she missed during her trip shopping trip these being a swimsuit and additional blouses, skirts and dresses. She grew a fondness for jewelry as well having gotten her ears pierced and purchased a lot of earrings, necklaces, bracelets and rings of various designs. Tammy had also grown to enjoy charity work using what money or time she had left to support environmental and animal groups she learned in her new life to love. But the biggest change Tammy made in her life during her first couple of months of being a woman was that she left her old apartment leaving the last vestiges of Thomas behind and moving in with her best friend Molly’s place becoming closer to not only her but also to Emily forming a girl’s group who spend a lot of time together. Altogether Tammy couldn’t be more happier, healthier or successful than Thomas and the future was only looking brighter.</p>
