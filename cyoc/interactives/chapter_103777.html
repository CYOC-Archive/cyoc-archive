<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha was a bit unnerved by Douglas&#39;s a game of footsie with her under the table, as that wasn&#39;t really what Martha was looking for. Did she have interest in Dawn, yes. She was beautiful and while flirtatious, she wasn&#39;t anything like the rogue werevixen that had clawed William. However, Martha didn&#39;t really have interest in Douglas. He was a handsome man and well built, but so was William, and while she didn&#39;t have the formal life/mate bond as she was a werecat, that didn&#39;t mean that she was interested in men besides William. From the moment he had proposed to her, Martha had felt that William was to be the only man for her. His repeating the proposal when he learned she was pregnant with Nate cemented it. It was why she had been so hurt by William&#39;s past infidelity.<br />
<br />
Her uneasiness came to a bit of an end when she felt Dawn&#39;s foot reach a point where it was not only rubbing against Martha&#39;s but against Douglas&#39;s foot as well. Dawn turned to her husband with a polite smile, but still spoke firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now dear, remember much of this is still very new to her and the arrangement as her and I,&quot; Dawn said to her husband, &quot;Perhaps one day when they are more comfortable... we may ask for more, but until then, let us be respectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; Douglas said weakly and looked over Martha with a somewhat sheepish look, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve transgressed on anything. Dawn and I have always been very open with each other and supportive in each other&#39;s desires. It&#39;s strengthened our bond as we know that we love each other... but because of Dawn&#39;s bi side, my wish to see her happy, and the fact that our marriage has always been open and mutually supportive... there have been some moments where we&#39;ve shared partners, especially when they were in as open a situation as our own...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we do try to be respectful of every partner&#39;s wishes,&quot; Dawn spoke, &quot;it betters THEIR enjoyment of the fun along with ours. And sex isn&#39;t fun one when only one side is feeling pleasure and is comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm?&quot; William wondered, as no one had played footsie with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing... just noticing and marveling on the beauty your wife brings to the table,&quot; Douglas spoke, &quot;and I couldn&#39;t help but notice it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re quite the looker, yourself,&quot; Dawn gave William a smile.<br />
<br />
William calmly took Martha&#39;s free hand with his and said to the Hales, &quot;Martha was ALWAYS beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha felt him squeeze her hand softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And after her transformation... her beauty only improved,&quot; William commented, &quot;Something I didn&#39;t think I was possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Dawn and Douglas smiled at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;That happens a lot,&quot; Douglas spoke, &quot;but I let myself get distracted by her beauty and forgot on what we had agreed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha felt a bit of comfort from William holding her hand and accepted the apology. Modesty for the moment still had her a bit nervous over being thought beautiful by so many people. It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t like the compliment, and that only furthered her interest in Dawn, but she&#39;d never had so many people think her beautiful and now say it to her. In Minnesota, she&#39;d really only had William, and even he hadn&#39;t said it as much as he had after their respective transformations. Now in Moon Lake, Martha not only had William but Frances and Samantha, some of the other teachers from the in service day at the elementary school, and now Dawn and her husband. It was odd to be the center of attention, and while she liked it, she hadn&#39;t fully gotten used to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Martha said after a moment, &quot;you are both very attractive as well... though I&#39;d think it&#39;d be best to stick with what we agreed to on the phone. William is all the male fox I could want or need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dawn and Douglas both nodded in acceptance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about a vixen?&quot; Dawn then asked playfully.<br />
<br />
Martha felt Dawn&#39;s feet continue to slide over own feet, and she noticed the female werefox had a very playful and knowing smile. Martha felt herself smile back as she caught a slight hint of arousal from Dawn&#39;s scent and felt William continue to massage her hand while Dawn played with Martha&#39;s feet. It gave her some comfort and let her cat eagerly speak to her about wanting Dawn as well. With that, Martha felt her nipples begin to harden and her own arousal beginning to kick in.<br />
<br />
&quot;The vixen very much holds my interest,&quot; Martha gave a smile, &quot;so long as we all remember the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all stood up, and out of the corner of her eye, she could see William&#39;s pants begin to gain the noticeable tent as his own member began to grow erect. She could feel herself growing a bit wet, knowing what the Hales had been invited for and feeling assured that they wouldn&#39;t press her into anything she wouldn&#39;t want. That seemed to raise more interest from the Hales as Martha could pick up the scent of Dawn and Douglas&#39;s arousal as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;We follow with the agreement made,&quot; Dawn promised.<br />
<br />
Martha then took William&#39;s arm and lead him toward the stairs to lead them to the bedroom and smiled to Dawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let us go upstairs and get more intimately acquainted,&quot; Martha gave a soft smile and began to head up the stairs, playfully swaying her hips as she did so. Dawn and Douglas were quick to follow, and while she was privately sure that Douglas was being just as interested in the swaying of her hips as Dawn surely was. She and William both turned back to their guests as they entered their bedroom. &quot;So... shall we do this in human form? Or shall we be furry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Furry, please,&quot; Dawn smiled came up to Martha and delivered a very passionate kiss as her eyes began to shift, going from brown to red with a vertical slit pupil.<br />
<br />
Martha closed her eyes as she began to return the kiss. She had been surprised by how fast Dawn had moved, but she did recover. The scent of William&#39;s, Dawn&#39;s, and Douglas&#39;s arousal beginning to get her own libido going into high gear. As brown fur began to grow all over her body, and feeling pleasurable in the process, and as her fingernails lengthened into claws, Martha brought up her hands to lift up Dawn&#39;s shirt. In this, Martha had found that Dawn&#39;s impressive breasts weren&#39;t covered by a bra. Martha opened her now green cat eyes to look to the orbs on Dawn&#39;s chest. Dawn&#39;s breasts were bigger than Martha&#39;s own bosom, even with the growth Martha had experienced when she became a werecat. White and red orange fur was growing  on her body, just as she knew it was growing on William&#39;s body behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmmm,&quot; Dawn moaned as Martha playfully rubbed and caressed her breasts while removing her shirt. She lifted her arms to let her shirt being taken off. Once off, she came closer to Martha as she watched Martha&#39;s face push forward into a  rounded feline muzzle. Dawn proceeded to lift up Martha&#39;s shirt, also finding that Martha had gone without a bra. She then moved to gently nibble and lick at Martha&#39;s right nipple.<br />
<br />
Martha moaned back as she felt William slide behind her. As her tail began to push out behind her, she felt William beginning to pull down her pants behind her while Douglas pulled down Dawn&#39;s skirt. She looked over her shoulder to see William fully transformed with his fully erect penis standing proudly outside his sheath. She smiled and reached with one hand to gently rub at Dawn&#39;s vulva and her clitoris which stood erect within the werevixen&#39;s vaginal opening, surrounded by white fur. Her other hand was quick to massage Dawn&#39;s breasts as Douglas came up behind her. His approach actually peaked some curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...?&quot; Martha found herself blurting, &quot;what kind of fox are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of a different phase,&quot; Douglas smiled.<br />
<br />
While the tip of his tail was white, like William&#39;s and Dawn&#39;s were as well, his ears, muzzle, tail, arms, and legs were black, and the rest of his body was a dark silver/gray. This contrasted the white chest and lower muzzle for William and Dawn, as well as the black ears, forearms, and digitgrade feet, and their red-orange bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m based off the Red Fox species, just as your husband and my wife are, but I&#39;m specifically based off the Red Fox&#39;s silver color phase,&quot; Douglas continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Martha commented but looked back to her husband and slid into a kneeling position on the bed and as Dawn rubbed at Martha&#39;s own erect clit triggering an orgasm in Martha. Privately she was more interested in William and Dawn&#39;s more traditional color phase, but she wasn&#39;t going to say that aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; William whispered to his wife, &quot;but it&#39;s now time for the real fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yes,&quot; Dawn agreed with one hand holding Martha&#39;s vagina open in order to feel William&#39;s penis as it slid into Martha&#39;s opening. She felt a bit jealous of Martha, as she felt that William was slightly larger than Douglas, but she didn&#39;t let that show as Douglas entered her from behind as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of... oooooohhhhh... yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssss...&quot; Martha moaned as she pressed herself against Dawn, feeling her furry breasts press against Dawn&#39;s, &quot;course.&quot;<br />
<br />
And their real fun began, and all expected the fun to lead to multiple orgasms for all each of them.</p>
