<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I manage to make my way to the principal&#39;s office, my sister already there. She&#39;s always a step ahead of me... The door opens, and a andgroynous looking person open up, all in slutty-formal clothings.<br />
<br />
-Ah! You must be the new sudents! The Feremay sisters if I do recall?<br />
<br />
-Yeah, that&#39;s us!<br />
<br />
I quietly nodded.<br />
<br />
-Come in, come in... I&#39;ll give you your schedules and locker number right away!<br />
<br />
The principal searched a bit through her desk, revealing her wet pussy and long cock dangling as she bent over. My cheeks flush red, and my sister quickly gained a brand new erection to work with. She quickly came back with two papers, and handed it to us. She had switched them, understandable as I do look like the little sister between us two...<br />
<br />
-You two can go to your first class! I warned the teacher of you arrival and they will present you to the others! I give you a big welcome to our school! We&#39;re happy to have you here!<br />
<br />
We left the office, exchanged our schedule so we have the good ones, and went separate ways. Rebecca did not give me any type of goodbye as she excitedly went to her first class, not that I expected it... I searched a while through the halls and corridors of the building, often spotting multiple students having &quot;moments&quot;, before finally finding my class. My hands are trembling, I don&#39;t know if I can do this... I really don&#39;t want to relive middle school all over again... The strange looks, the awful teasing, and sometimes the violent act against me... I&#39;m scared... The door is standing right there, but it feels like a burden to place my palm on the knob, and turn it.<br />
<br />
I dodged a splash of cum the second I opened the entrance, it splash on the wall behind me in a huge sound squelshing sound. I look back into the room to see a futa with two huge dicks panting heavily. She looked at me with a strange gentlness and gave a soft smile.<br />
<br />
-Don&#39;t be shy, the walls are clean so you can lick if you want!<br />
<br />
I look back at the  puddle formed on the wall, starting to drip on the floor. Some students looked hungrily at it, their tongue sticking out.<br />
<br />
-I...I...I think I&#39;ll... p-pass if you don&#39;t mind...<br />
<br />
-Your loss.<br />
<br />
I advanced into the classroom, almost empty, except for a few students in the back jerking off. I can deduce the twin dicked futa to be the teacher, as her mature body contrast with the rest of the inhabitants of the room.<br />
<br />
-You&#39;re Stephanie right? The new student? I&#39;m happy to welcome you into my history class. You know we&#39;re not in a private school right? You can get strip off some layers if you want. It&#39;s getting hot in here anyway...<br />
<br />
-I-I&#39;m fine this way...<br />
<br />
-Oh...kay? Anyway, class should start soon, you can take the seat on the back there. It&#39;s empty. Oh, and here! This will be your notebook for the class.<br />
<br />
She hands to me a book titled &quot;Futanaris throughout history&quot; ornated with a rather suggestive image on its cover. I approached my desk clumsily, dodging the legs of students scattered on the ground and the puddles of you &quot;know what&quot;. I sat on my chair and opened said book, awaiting the ring of the bell. This school was no different, everywhere I go, there&#39;s always sex. I can&#39;t take any safe step anymore... A student slumped to at the seat next to me, already taking a sleeping position, until they spot me. It&#39;s the girl from the bus!<br />
<br />
-Oh! What a coincidence! You&#39;re new here right? I say that because I never saw you before this morning... And I think I didn&#39;t catch your name?<br />
<br />
-I&#39;m S-Stephanie... I just moved here...<br />
<br />
-Oh really? I didn&#39;t notice! In what country do they force you to get that much clothing on a summer day? Or in general? I think I would die if I had to wear gloves and stockings like you! But don&#39;t worry, here you can get these off of you! I can help you if you want...<br />
<br />
-N-nobody forced me into these!... I just... prefer it like that...<br />
<br />
Her confused look returned from earlier, an eyebrow raised.<br />
<br />
-Don&#39;t you tell me... you actually like to be dressed like this? Some would call this indecent you know? You might get obligated to get some off by the strict teachers!<br />
<br />
-... They... They c-can&#39;t really do that right? You&#39;re just joking... right?<br />
<br />
-Oh, I&#39;m telling you! The gym teacher never let us wear anything other than undergarnments!<br />
<br />
This is not possible... It&#39;s an attack to my liberty! This school is even worse than the last... If I get naked in front of a whole class... they&#39;re going to laugh, mock me, and maybe they&#39;ll... It happened once... I got pinned by a crazy student in middle school... It&#39;s traumatizing... I felt so violated... Please I don&#39;t want this to happen again! Not anymore... not ever again...<br />
<br />
-Hey are you okay? You look pale! I didn&#39;t mean to scare you or anything! It&#39;s just... I and most others here are not used to... this choice? I myself don&#39;t understand that, but don&#39;t panic over it!... Maybe... maybe we can find some agreements with teachers if it truly matters to you...<br />
<br />
-... Y-Yeah... *sob*... That w-would be great... *snif*<br />
<br />
-Hey, hey... It&#39;s okay... Let&#39;s just go through this class first okay?<br />
<br />
At least I have someone who cares about me a bit... She actually listened to my opinion for once... Even if she doesn&#39;t understand it. I looked at her own pants, were a small bump had formed again. Seeing me looking at it, she quickly hid it with her hand, her face is as red as a tomato.<br />
<br />
-S-sorry Steph... I&#39;m just... I&#39;m just kind of into cute girls you know? It doesn&#39;t corelate in any way at what we just said!<br />
<br />
She was looking away from me, seemingly flustered by her own arousal. She&#39;s into cute girls? Does that mean... she thinks I&#39;m cute? I mean... I&#39;m small, not endowed in a lot of ways... It&#39;s strange to get attention like that all of a sudden... I might be blushing as well...<br />
<br />
The class started, and the moans of the students slowly stopped. Some were still audible through the teacher&#39;s rambling, and a lot of hands are in pants more than on desks. The lesson was about the rising of the futa population back in 1492, all happened because of the discovery of america. All the inhabitants that were already there before the arrival of europeans were futanaris, and from this point the genes started spraiding through lineage and generations. At first, religions and estates were against this calamity, as it simply was concidered against &quot;god&#39;s will&quot; when creating the world. But after a taste, the idea changed, and the world did with it.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a story I heard countless times, so it occurred kind of boring to me. Trysha seems to be of the same opinion, as she snore softly, her head resting on her desk. She is absolutely unbothered of everything around her. Then, as the teacher stopped looking, a random girl sneaked from her seat to right under Trysha&#39;s. The girl unbuttoned her shirt, leaving her obvoius cleavage free, and pulled down Trysha&#39;s pants, leaving a small dick springing to life. My gaze diverted as soon as the act started. I seeked the teacher&#39;s intervention, but she is either completely oblivious of what&#39;s happening under the desk, or she just doesn&#39;t care. The movement next to me are soft and quiet, but also extremely distracting. It continued through the whole class, nobody cared about it, and I finally understood what Trysha meant by people profitting in her sleep. The bell finally rang and the girl below retreated, her face covered in sperm. Trysha is still sleeping, but her breath is shallow and her face crimson.<br />
<br />
-MMmmmhhhhh... What? I&#39;m awakeeeen...<br />
<br />
-A... Are you okay?<br />
<br />
-Yeaaah... why the questioooon?<br />
<br />
I pointed at her stripped lower body, messy and stained. She grabbed her pants and pulled them back on.<br />
<br />
-Was it yoouuuu?<br />
<br />
-No! N-no at all!... It w-was that girl... I&#39;d never...<br />
<br />
I almost gagged over the thought. I know most would, but I really am not the kind to greet someone by sucking them off!<br />
<br />
-Oh.... I see...<br />
<br />
Her expression slumped even further. Is that deception I just heard in her voice? Did she actually hoped that I... no probably not... She just is annoyed by the people profitting. That&#39;s it. Yeah.<br />
<br />
-Anyway, do you want to go eat together at lunch? I could present you to my group of friends! I swear they&#39;re kind! Though I&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll understand your clothing choices either... Or your abstinence. <br />
<br />
Joining a friend group can go either way, to my advantage, or to my disadvantage. Yes they could help me get accepted and blend into the mass, but on the other hand, they could also reject me over my tries. I&#39;m not sure about this...<br />
<br />
-Well... I-I&#39;m going to my next class first... a-and then maybe that I&#39;ll...<br />
<br />
-Look at your schedule.<br />
<br />
I did as told, and surprisingly, there is only a single period in the morning, meaning that it is now time for dinner. I looked at her with an eyebrow frowned.<br />
<br />
-It&#39;s because of morning hoods. It&#39;s impossible for most to stay concentrated with an erection all morning, so they cut the first class to let people relieve and actually learn something for the next one. You&#39;re coming now?<br />
<br />
Everybody in the classroom had already left, even the teacher.</p>
