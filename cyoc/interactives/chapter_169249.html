<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Save for that morning’s detour, Leah had been having a good day and finally was able to spend a moment with her friend.  She felt a little silly being dressed in this rather juvenile white dress, but at least she could hang out with her friends.  It seemed a bit odd that they were hanging out at the playground. <br />
<br />
“So where were you this morning, we though you would come by?”  Tanya asked<br />
<br />
“I had to help my step with her shopping, came as soon as I could” Leah responded wondering who this Tanya was, she seemed familiar, but she couldn’t place her. <br />
<br />
“That sucks.” Hester said.<br />
<br />
“You could have at least changed first” Molly offered up. <br />
<br />
“You look like a rejected flower girl” Tanya interjected. <br />
<br />
“Did your new mommy dress you for a party at her daycare?” Hester sarcastically commented.<br />
<br />
“Hey, cut it out” Molly shouted at the other girls. “Can’t you see you are making her cry.”<br />
<br />
Leah couldn’t understand, but for some reason, she did feel like crying and tears started to fall. <br />
<br />
“Leah, it will be okay, do you want to come sit on my lap?” Molly offered.<br />
<br />
Leah didn’t know what to do.  It was weird why would she want to sit on Molly’s lap.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure your okay?” Molly asked again.<br />
<br />
Hester moved closer to Leah.<br />
<br />
Leah cringed a little bit.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry little girl” Hester said.<br />
<br />
Leah felt a warm wetness trickle onto her bottom.<br />
<br />
Hester stuck a finger into her pants, “she is wetting her training pants.”<br />
<br />
Leah woke with a start.<br />
<br />
Leah was immediately relieved that it was a dream, but was awoken to a harsh reality and started to cry as the pacifier fell from her mouth.<br />
<br />
Tina was caught a bit off guard at Leah’s sudden awakening.  It was more like a toddler than that of a teen.  Stepping around to face her, Tina noticed the display of pee escaping poor Leah’s training pants, to be reabsorbed into those soaked underpants.<br />
<br />
Tina had just chided herself for imagining her teen as a baby, when this display, on top of everything happening this morning, was making the case for her.<br />
<br />
“Oh, its okay baby.  Mommy will take care of you.”  <br />
<br />
Tina tried hard to comfort Leah as she sat there and finished urinating.<br />
<br />
Leah felt like a toddler as she awoke from her dream.  It certainly didn’t help as her wits returned and she found herself peeing her pants, only to realized she was sitting in some kind of stroller. It was too much for her to take and all she could do was just cry.  She just wanted someone to make it all better.<br />
<br />
That’s when she heard her step mother comfort her.<br />
<br />
Soon her new mommy had her unsnapped and held her close.  For the second time today, Leah felt warm and loved.  It had been a long time since, well since she had a mommy’s love like she had been having today.<br />
<br />
Leah kept crying as she felt herself being carried somewhere.<br />
<br />
“I know how scary it must be to have such a bad dream” Tina said.<br />
<br />
Leah just nodded her head as she continued to cry.<br />
<br />
“But now mommy has you and can protect you from all those scary things.” <br />
<br />
Leah just listened.  Then suddenly said “they were teasing me and calling me a a a…….. they were saying….. I I I….. was… a” and she continued to cry <br />
<br />
“It’s all right baby. Mommy has you.”  Tina, more than before felt like she was dealing with one of her toddlers.  Two accidents in less than 4 hours from a teenager, made her wonder if there was more going on here.<br />
<br />
Leah couldn’t handle it.  She woke up in a stroller, she dreamt she was a toddler from some random girls she thought were friends but turned out to be somehow taking care of her.  Then she woke up wetting herself.  She hadn’t wet the bed in years.  What was becoming of her?  Lost in thought she barely registered what Tina was saying, something about taking care of things.<br />
<br />
“Mommy will change your diaper… oops” Tina stopped herself then tried to continue hoping Leah didn’t realize the diaper comment.  “and get you all taken care of with a nice new outfit for the rest of today.  Then maybe a late lunch?” <br />
<br />
Taking a cue from earlier in the day, as Tina walked she rocked Leah and rubbed her back, unfortunately this time, holding her got herself a little damp.  “Shhhh! It’s okay baby let it out.  Mommy will make it all better.”<br />
<br />
Slowly the hysterics turned to whimpers. Without any complaint Leah was lowered on to the changing table in the nursery.  <br />
<br />
Tina was unsure how this would go, but it worked so well at the store, that she figure, what the hell?<br />
<br />
“There we go baby.” Tina said as she carefully removed the dress and grasping both Leah’s ankles in one hand lifted her legs sliding off her soaked training pants.  Then using some nicely scented baby wipes cleaned her little bottom taking a moment to tickle her feet.  After a playfully detour or two, Leah was now giggling and back to being the happy baby she was when last she was changed.<br />
<br />
“I need to get you something to wear, could you take a look at this and tell me if you think the little ones at my daycare might like it?” <br />
Tina handed a plastic ring that had a collection of other plastic items on it.  One was a small ball on a stick like thing, it was like a small rattle.  That caught Leah’s attention first and she enjoyed just moving the ball around and listening to the little things inside make their noises.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for Tina to return to a sight she had hardly expected.  Leah was holding the toy in her mouth and moving it around clearly trying to use the rattle.  It was just like the sales video.  Only Leah is a 15 years old not an 8 month old. <br />
<br />
From the reaction to the toy, Tina figured she probably picked out the right outfit for Leah to wear, now to sell it.<br />
<br />
Tina laid the clothing out on the bed and did something with the blanket that was there.<br />
<br />
“Baby, I want to try something, can you trust mommy?”<br />
<br />
Leah giggled and shook her head making the toy rattle again.<br />
<br />
“You like this toy don’t you?  Well you can play with it again when we finish.  For now I want to play a game where I need you to relax and imagine yourself drifting back to when you were just a little girl.”  Tina pulled the toy away.  Can we do that?”<br />
<br />
“Uh hu”<br />
<br />
“Shhh! For now I need you to be very quiet.  I am going to turn out the light so the room is only going to be dimly lit.  Then I am going to carry you to a blanket and wrap you p so you are warm and cozy.”<br />
<br />
Tina unsnapped Leah from the changing table and lifted her up depositing her on the blanket she prepared on the top of the crib.<br />
<br />
“Focus on mommy’s voice.  Now mama want you to think back to when you were really little, just a baby.  Let your mind wander.  You didn’t do anything for yourself.  If you were tired, mama rocked you to sleep.  If you were hungry mommy fed you.  If you were unhappy mommy made you smile.  If you had an accident mommy took care of it.  All you had to do was grow and learn and behave.” <br />
<br />
Leah focused on her stepmother’s voice, little did she realize she was being swaddled in the blanket that Tina had laid out before hand.<br />
<br />
“Do you remember?”<br />
<br />
Leah gave a small nod she appeared to be in a trance.<br />
<br />
Tina cradled her swaddled little one and sat with her in the rocker.  <br />
<br />
“Your such a good girl.  Mommy is very proud of her good little girl.”<br />
<br />
Leah gave a silly little smile as a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s right.  But are you really a little girl or are you a big girl?  Cause Tina though Leah is a 15 year old big girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears started to form in Leah’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Oh mommy’s sorry.”  Tina said in a tone reserved for her little ones.<br />
<br />
“Mommy will do some talking now and I don’t want baby to be unhappy.  Is it okay if mama calls you baby, just for now?”<br />
<br />
Leah nodded.<br />
<br />
“Mommy always wanted to have babies of her own.  She loves babies so much that she has a business taking care of lots of little boys and girls. Some of those boys and girls are almost 5 years old and some are only a few months old.  Now that she married a man she loves very much she want to have her very own children.  She was very lucky that the man she married has her own little girl, so she has an instant child a nice little girl, you.  Tina touched Leah gently on the nose with her index finger.”<br />
<br />
Leah smiled again and gave out a little breadth of happy air.<br />
<br />
“So, today I had a wonderful day with that little girl because a strange thing happened, I got to play mommy not just the evil step mommy.  It seems that she got to play the little girl and not just the naughty step daughter and I think we both had a good time playing.”</p>

Does Leah want to continue to play?</h3>
