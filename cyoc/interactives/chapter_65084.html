<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As Jeff went for the doorknob, his stomach growled fiercely from how hungry he was feeling. He could not believe just how hungry he felt, 
but it didn’t matter now that the pizza was there. As Jeff turned the knob, he noticed that a lot of eerie light flooded the room from the two 
eastern facing windows that fully illuminated the otherwise low lit room. Jeff, who had been planning to spend the night at home, was going to 
eat in his bedroom and watch a horror movie or two while he continued to fiddle with the Chronovac to see what things he could potentially 
come up with. From what he could tell, the possibilities were endless… especially with the whole randomize feature. As Jeff thought about what 
he could do with the machine and thinking about how well lit the entire living-room and kitchen combination was by the spontaneous flood of 
the eerie pale moonlight. He thought it was odd that there was a full moon all of a sudden, especially since that wasn’t supposed to take place 
until Halloween and they were just at the very beginning of October.</br>

<br>With his mind wandering for what seemed like a half-hour, but was really only a few minutes, the doorbell chimed again and snapped Jeff 
back to reality. Jeff quickly turned the knob and then opened the door a bit quicker than normal. He knew that the pizza delivery guy had other 
deliveries to get to and he probably wanted to get to them all to make more money, especially since their income was based mainly on how 
many pizzas they could deliver during a shift and the tips they received, which was the main reason he always tipped well no matter where he 
went out to eat. If someone provided him a service, Jeff would always tip more than the usual… up to forty percent of the total bill. As he 
opened the door, Jeff saw a young man no older than twenty-five years old with the build of a linebacker or a construction worker. His muscles 
were thick and supple, padded with a bit of fat, which showed that he didn’t care to look like one of those huge and disgusting looking 
bodybuilders out there that do competitions. Quickly glancing over him to assess the delivery guy, Jeff noticed that: his eyes were a brilliant 
mixture of blue, green and brown; his face was rugged, being hard and lightly dusted with stubble that seemed fresh and just starting to break 
the skin; he also had a decent coating of walnut brown hair on his forearms, which matched his head of hair, that went to the top of his hands 
and ended on his fingers; he also had a bit of short and trimmed chest hair visible from the V-neck of his uniform shirt which showed off his 
muscles nicely. Looking at his shirt, Jeff noticed the name tag which identified him to be “David”. Jeff knew that the way David looked, he 
probably had little difficulty finding a girl to call his own. The entire time the two were standing there, the pizza guy held the pizza box flat on 
his right palm with it being in the center for perfect balancing. As Jeff went to take the pizza from David, he noticed that his forehead was 
perspiring a bit heavy as a drop of sweat ran down from his right eyebrow down the side of his face. Concerned for David, Jeff invited him into 
his home for a moment, thinking that he just needed a glass of water or something. </br>

<br> “Hey bud, are you feeling ok?” Jeff asked, as he motioned for David to come in and set the pizza down on the glass-topped ataman in 
front of the plush and dark leather sofa that sat five. </br>

<br> “Y… yeah, thanks… I think that walk from the elevator, through the long hallway to your place took a bit out of me for some reason. I am 
usually not like this, but I have also been running around delivering pizzas. In fact, you are my last one after delivering forty orders.” David said 
as he went where Jeff directed him. </br>

<br> “Wow… forty orders! Is that normal for you guys and did you get good tips?” Jeff said, wondering how well the guy made out from 
delivering that much stuff. </br>

<br> “Yeah… I made out pretty well tonight, got about two hundred dollars in tips… not to mention what I will get for the mileage on my car.” 
David said as he went to place the food on the ataman, almost falling over onto the food as he leaned over, with Jeff quickly catching him so 
that he didn’t get hurt. </br>

“Wow… well I think you need to take a break for a minute since this is your last delivery and you are obviously pretty fatigued. You sit here, 
relax for a moment and I will go get you a glass of water.” Jeff said as he guided David to the sofa and ran off to get a glass of water once 
David was seated. </br>

<br> “Well thanks mister, you are awfully nice!” David said happily since he was lucky that Jeff was as nice as he was being. </br>

<br> “Hey… it’s not a problem and call me Jeff.” He said as the glass filled. </br>

<br> “Ok Jeff… hey, do you mind if I took off my shirt, I am burning up for some reason?” David asked, his forehead now drenched with sweat 
and his shirt was looking fairly wet from how much he was sweating. </br>

<br> “No, I don’t mind at all. I think you might have come down with something and you probably just have one hell of a fever all of a sudden. 
I mean, I know it is possible since I am a doctor, but something like this just doesn’t happen out of nowhere.” Jeff said as he was halfway back 
to David with the very large glass filled with water. </br>

<br> “Thank you for your hospitality Jeff…” David said trailing off, pulling off his shirt to help cool himself off. </br>

<br>David pulled his shirt completely off his torso, putting the wet shirt next to him on the sofa and grabbed the glass carefully so not spill 
any of it on Jeff’s nice furniture; Jeff noticed that his torso was even bigger than what the shirt showed. David’s back was nice and big, with 
nicely sized lats with no body hair, but Jeff could see that David put a lot of emphasis on his chest, shoulder and arms. David’s arms, which Jeff 
saw while he had his shirt on, were huge and Jeff guessed that they were around twenty-six inches in diameter. His shoulders were nice and 
round, as big as a basketball a piece that connected to decent sized traps. His chest on the other hand was massive and Jeff didn’t even want to 
guess how big they were, but each pec looked to be the size of a keg of beer, with a light dusting of the same colored hair on his chest. David’s 
stomach was somewhat flat, but also had the pudgy look even though there was little to no fat there. For Jeff, it was hard for him not to pounce 
on this guy and have his way with him. Being gay and a doctor, he had seen a lot of different types of men in his short tenure as a general 
physician, but no one looked like David. Jeff was starting to get a tent in his pants that he hoped would go away and that David wouldn’t 
notice. It was very difficult for Jeff to resist, but he did it anyway. There was no telling what this guy could do or was capable of if he wasn’t at 
least bi-sexual and wanting the physical encounter with a random guy. </br>

<br> “So David… how are you feeling?” Jeff asked genuinely concerned for David’s health. </br>

<br> “Well… I feel a little bit better, but not as good as you must be feeling right now.” David said, moving his head toward Jeff’s crotch, 
noticing Jeff’s raging boner. </br>

<br> “Damn it! I was trying to hide it and hoped you wouldn’t notice it…” Jeff said embarrassed. </br>

<br> “Yeah… I noticed it all right. I get that a lot from gay or bisexual guys, but it is ok because I am gay too.” David said slyly, feeling slightly 
hornier all of a sudden. </br>

<br> “Well… now that you have told me how you feel, I have to be really honest… I am gay too and I have been fighting the urge to pounce on 
you!” Jeff said with a smile on his face. </br>

<br>Hearing that, David raised both of his eyebrows simultaneously and then grunted as an extremely sudden fit of pain washed over his 
entire body. Seeing and hearing this, Jeff’s thoughts went from sexual back to concern for him and leaned in closer to ask David what was 
going on and what he was feeling. </br>

<br> “Are you ok David?” Jeff asked with a concerned tone in his voice. </br>

<br> “Yeah… I think so. Man… that was fucking crazy, it felt like every fiber in my body was being electrocuted at once! I think I will be fine 
now. Man… whatever I got is not a nice sickness!” David said chuckling at his own light-hearted comment. </br>

<br>As David spoke, Jeff placed his large and soft right hand on David’s forehead to check his cursory temperature just to gauge how hot he 
must have been. As soon as his hand made contact with David’s skin, Jeff pulled his hand away quickly. </br>

<br> “Man… you are burning up! I am going to call your work and let them know what is going on because as a doctor I don’t want you to go 
anywhere right now.” Jeff said as he pulled out his cell phone and hit the touch-screen button to redial the pizza place’s number. </br>

<br>As Jeff brought the phone up to his ear after making sure that the number was dialed and had connected he started walking toward his 
bedroom so that David could not hear what he was telling them. Unbeknownst to Jeff and surprisingly to David… he could hear what Jeff was 
saying to them. Even though Jeff was in another room completely, the door being almost closed and Jeff speaking in what a normal person 
would call a soft tone, to David it sounded as if Jeff was still sitting right next to him. Now that he was able to hear what was going on, even 
though it was completely odd, David focused on what Jeff was telling his boss. Listening in, David heard Jeff telling his boss that he was not 
going to be able to return to work because he had fallen gravely ill and being a doctor, he could not let David go until his fever had at least 
broken. The conversation ended as he could hear his boss ask Jeff how much he wanted to leave David for a tip on his card, to which Jeff 
replied ten dollars. David’s boss then told Jeff that they would just close him out and put his money in an envelope in the store safe and he 
could get it when he was able to return to work. When the conversation ended, Jeff walked back out to see a huge smile on David’s face. </br>

<br> “So… are you feeling better?” Jeff asked plainly. </br>

<br> “No… not really…” David said trailing off. </br>

<br> “Oh… so then what is the smile for?” Jeff asked inquisitively. </br>

<br> “You… you are just a very nice guy!” David said with excitement in his voice, then grunting and grimacing as another wave of pain racked 
his body, this time it was much stronger. </br>

<br>Feeling very concerned for David now, Jeff flew across the room and went over to check on him. Immediately, Jeff grabbed David’s wrist 
and took his pulse, which caused his eyes to almost pop out of their sockets because it was very high. Jeff took it again moments later because 
he thought he got the count wrong since it was way too high for any human being. After the second, third and even fourth count… Jeff just 
stared at David. His pulse was over three hundred beats per minute, which should have put David into cardiac arrest, but he just sat there wide 
awake and alert… albeit in a great deal of pain as he sat there clutching at his abdomen as he doubled over. Suddenly his moans of pain turned 
into what sounded a lot like growls, then just as quickly as they started, the pain stopped and David was able to sit up normally. </br>

<br> “Fuck! Oh my god that fucking hurt! What the fuck is going on with me Jeff? I mean… I could hear your whole conversation with my boss 
in the other room with your door mostly closed. What is crazier that it sounded to me as if you both were right next to me. I can even smell 
how your fear for my health and safety, not to mention the large amount of pre you must have expelled earlier when you had that raging boner! 
There are too many strange things going on with me and I want an answer!” David said with a bit of anger in his now deeper voice, but not 
toward Jeff because there was nothing that he could do or could have done to cause any of this. </br>

<br> “David… I am sorry for what is happening to you, but you know I can only do so much here at home. There is no way for me to even 
begin to explain why you are in so much pain right now, let alone why you can hear and even smell better than the normal person. These 
things don’t really make sense, but I will help you through things as best as I can.” Jeff said, trying to console the pain-ridden man before him. 
</br>

<br> “I… I know Jeff…” David struggled to say through the pain, but the words didn’t really sound like spoken words, more like grunts or even 
growls. </br>

<br>Then, suddenly… David screamed out in agony, clutching his head, feeling like his head was about to be split open by the interior 
pressure or by being hit by some blunt force object. David could not really tell where the pain was coming from, but the only thing that he did 
know was that it hurt like hell. Suddenly, he felt a tingling as well as a burning sensation in his ears. </br>

<br> “Jesus Christ, my ears feel like they are on fire while being bitten by ants!” David yelled out, frustrated by everything that ailed him. 
</br>

<br>Jeff ran and got another large glass of water for him, hoping that if David could drink the water, it may relieve his heat related issues. 
While he was in the kitchen, Jeff got the idea to go into his personal supply of medical items that he kept locked away in his safe, hoping that 
he still had the Morphine that he acquired some time ago. Running into his room, the glass of water sitting on the counter in the kitchen, Jeff 
quickly opened the safe and rummaged through his supplies. As soon as he started, Jeff found a: syringe, needle and the small bottle of 
Morphine, which was all that he needed to immediately help David. He put the needle into the syringe and then sucked up ten cubic 
centimeters of Morphine. On the way back out to David, Jeff grabbed the glass of water. Immediately, Jeff grabbed David’s arm, but at first he 
did not want to release his abdomen, clutching himself and hoping that the pain would just stop. </br>

<br> “David… David, give me your arm. I am going to give you some Morphine to help with the pain. Hopefully this will take care of things for 
you and I also got you another glass of water.” Jeff said, trying to console him more and hoping to God that what he was about to do would 
work. </br>

<br>Reluctantly, David let his arm go while continuing to clutch his abdomen with his left arm. Jeff quickly tapped David’s right arm, looking 
for a vein and once he found it, Jeff stuck him with the needle and administered the drug. As the liquid pain relief flooded his veins, quickly 
racing through his body and going to the brain, Jeff immediately saw that what he had done helped. As quickly as the tormenting onslaught of 
pain hit him, that same pain faded, but Jeff also knew that it was only a temporary fix. </br>

<br>As David was still breathing quite heavily, Jeff held the glass of water near him, trying to get him to drink the liquid. With the fever he had 
and his heart going nuts, Jeff knew that David probably lost quite a bit of liquid in his body and he needed to get it up quickly. As things 
progressively settled for David, he started to enter a somewhat euphoric state from the drug, but he recognized Jeff and the glass of water, so 
David took it and started to drink. Immediately, David’s mind cleared up, but he still did not feel any pain. </br>

<br> “Jeff… what did you put in this water?” David asked rather coherently, much to Jeff’s surprise. </br>

<br> “Um… nothing, it is the same water you drank earlier. Why do you ask?” Jeff said puzzled. </br>

<br> “Well… it is just that I taste quite a bit of iron in the water. You don’t have hard water do you?” David said, puzzled by what he was 
tasting. </br>

<br> “No… but there is something that is hard right now.” Jeff said, nodding down to David’s crotch. </br>

<br>David looked down at his crotch, and then looked up at Jeff with a big grin, showing off all of his teeth. At first, Jeff paid no attention to 
them while David smiled, but then something looked off and Jeff peered closer at David’s teeth. Looking at his teeth, Jeff noticed that not only 
were David’s gums bleeding, but his incisors looked longer and even sharper than normal. </br>

<br> “Um… David… the reason you taste iron in the water is because your gums are bleeding. First, I have a question for you… have your 
incisors always been long and pretty sharp?” Jeff said explaining at least a part of the current situation. </br>

<br> “Um… no, can’t say that I have and I have no idea why my gums are bleeding… I have always taken good care of my dental hygiene.” 
David said as he got up carefully, feeling a bit woozy from everything he endured as well as from the Morphine. </br>

<br>Now that he was on his feet, David started moving toward the bathroom, curious to see what Jeff had even been talking about. As they 
moved to the bathroom, Jeff trailed behind David and noticed a few more things about him that was out of the ordinary. Jeff noticed that 
David’s fingernails were slightly longer than normal, the hair on his body was definitely thicker and seemed to spread. Previously, there was not 
a hair on David’s back, but now there was a light dusting like his chest. Jeff also noticed that his ears were different, they were a different 
shape and came to points. Suddenly, things made sense to Jeff and his eyes widened. He knew that he had to check something because this 
was something that was not even supposed to be possible. </br>

<br> “Hey David… are you going to be ok? I need to go into my room and check something out. It could be the reason for your current 
condition.” Jeff said with urgency in his voice. </br>

<br> “Y… yeah, I think I will be fine.” David said plainly. </br>

<br>Jeff quickly ran from the threshold of the bathroom to his room while David went into the bathroom to check on himself in the mirror. 
When Jeff got into his room, he immediately went to the Chronovac and checked to see what exactly it said on the screen. The read out said: 
<p><strong>
<p>Warning: Horror Scenario has been activated.</p>
<p>Subject: Pizza Delivery Person.</p>
<p>Horror Theme: Delivery Person is a werewolf.
<p>Warning: Werewolf subject is a true werewolf that if it bites anyone, they too will become a werewolf. Werewolf transformation is 
permanent in first subject as well as all subsequent infected. Proceed with caution, werewolf transformation is a non-changeable 
transformation within Chronovac Programming and CANNOT BE UNDONE.</p> 
<p>Warning: Transmission of werewolf gene is highly virulent and can be transmitted through various means, including: bites, scratches, 
ingesting blood and sexual fluids. If the user of the Chronovac does not want to become a werewolf, they must take extreme caution because if 
they are in the presence of said werewolf, their fate was already secured upon coming into contact with the werewolf.</p>
Warning: Werewolf subject and all subsequent infected are immortal, nothing can injure or kill them and they are also unable to age in 
appearance beyond thirty-five years old.</p>
<p>Warning: Age shifting can not progress beyond thirty-five, even by using the Chronovac, however the werewolf subject can be regressed 
via Chronovac programming.</p>
<p>Note: Werewolf subject and subsequent infected can transform at will between human and anthro wolf appearance.</p>
<p>Note: Werewolf subject and subsequent infected may or may not retain human thought. Whether or not they keep human intellect has been 
randomized.</p></strong>
Knowing that he was still living at home from just getting out of med school, his sister was there and could potentially cause a problem. 
Jeff immediately looked for the statistics of his living situation and changed those parameters so that he and David would be alone so that if 
things happened the way he wanted, no one else would get in the way.</br>

<br>Jeff could not believe what he was seeing displayed on the screen… it was impossible. Somehow, when he placed an order online for 
pizza, it created this scenario… which explained everything that had been happening. With this information, he knew that it would be very soon 
till he had a transformed werewolf in his bathroom that may or may not keep his human side. Jeff knew that this may turn out bad because no 
matter what, he too would be a werewolf before the night was over and he may or may not keep his humanity as well. The only thing that Jeff 
could do at this point was to see whether David kept his humanity. If he did, Jeff knew that he too would become a werewolf, but if David 
didn’t… Jeff knew his fate would most likely to become food for him. Since there was nothing left for him to do, Jeff went back to the bathroom 
to see what David was doing. </br>

<br>Back in the bathroom, David leaned on the counter and looked at himself closely in the mirror. Immediately he noticed that: his face grew 
much thicker stubble since he shaved before work nearly eight hours ago; his incisors were definitely much longer, sharper and even thicker 
than he ever remembered them being; he also noticed that his body had increased in muscle slightly while his ears changed from being oval to 
being more oblong with a tip at the end. Seeing all of these things and remembering his heightened senses, David knew that he was turning 
into a werewolf, but the question was… how was this even possible. David knew that Jeff didn’t have anything to do with it simply because he 
had been feeling odd before he entered Jeff’s place. David wondered if it was in his parents genes and he was the lucky one to have them 
become active. Regardless, David felt lucky and even grateful because as long as he could remember, David had always liked the idea of the 
werewolf and even fantasized about becoming one at some point, even though he knew that it was highly unlikely. Now… here he was, slowly 
turning into the creature he always wanted to be! </br>

<br>As Jeff got to the door, he arrived in just enough time to see a part of David’s transformation take place. David saw Jeff in the reflection of 
the mirror and looked up at the reflection so Jeff could see his face. While David looked up at Jeff, his eyes turned from their brilliant 
combination of colors to a brilliant forest green while the rest of his white eyes turned to an amberish hue. Seeing that Jeff was not moved by 
this shifting, David turned around to face Jeff. What Jeff saw in front of him was nothing short of amazing. Before, David’s muscles were huge 
and were lightly dusted with hair… now they were slightly bigger and covered in his sexy hair. David was also standing there in his boxer 
briefs, having felt seriously constrained by the fabric since his thighs thickened to what they were now. Seeing David like this, in a state just 
prior to going full werewolf, Jeff felt a little weak in the knees while his cock got ragingly hard. Seeing this, David smiled showing off what were 
now his fangs and walked up to Jeff. </br>

<br> “Mmmm… looks like someone other than me likes what he sees!” David said in his newer, deeper and more animalistic voice. </br>

<br> “Yeah, I can’t help it. You are an attractive man and now that you are turning into a werewolf, well… that just makes you all the more 
attractive!” Jeff said shyly, embarrassed that he felt this way. </br>

<br>David motioned for Jeff to stand next to him at the bathroom counter so that they could be near each other and so that David could watch 
his own, personal transformation. As David turned around to look at his reflection, he noticed that more of his body started changing. His 
hands started to get puffier with thick pads of skin growing on his fingers and palms. As David watched, he saw claws sprout from under his 
fingernails, pushing them up while the claws grew outward covered in blood. David also noticed that he tasted a warm, iron filled liquid and 
immediately noticed his fangs started growing again, this time to the point where they were breaking the seal of his lips. Then, out of nowhere, 
shit hit the fan and his whole body shifted. His feet grew into paws, with thick blood covered talons ripping his socks to shreds. His legs 
snapped and reformed to fit more of how a wolf would walk if it walked upright. David’s entire body quickly and very rapidly grew more and 
more coarse and thick hair, which was actually his fur. His head shifted completely as his face pushed out to a more lupine shape, his nose 
flattening, darkened and became moist like a true canine. His ears shifted further, growing longer and more triangular, moving toward the top 
of his head. His tongue lengthened and widened to fit his mouth better while the rest of his teeth changed to better suit his new diet. Suddenly, 
David started to moan, feeling his lower regions changing. Wanting to be completely free of clothing, David took his claws and rendered his 
boxers to mere shreds of fabric that fell to floor beneath him and rested strewn about. With his lower half revealed, Jeff could not help but to 
drool over the sight. David was as thick as a twelve ounce can of soda and about seven inches in length; his balls were the size of peach pits 
and from his transformation, Jeff watched his size increase even more. David moaned as he felt things increase in size, thickening and 
lengthening to make his genitalia even more monstrous. Jeff could not believe that David’s cock lengthened a half inch more while thickening 
to a fosters can of beer, while his balls grew to the size of small eggs. While all of that was going on a growth developed at the base of David’s 
spine, lengthening to reach the middle portion of his back all while developing fur there as well. </br>

<br>As the transformation subsided, Jeff could see that David was not only panting, but also his cock was dribbling quite a bit of pre, which 
made his huge, human, and mushroom shaped cock head glisten under the pale moonlight flooding the room. What Jeff had just witnessed had 
him hornier than he could ever remember being. Jeff wanted to taste the werewolf’s fluids, making him become a werewolf as well, but the 
thing was… he didn’t know if David kept his humanity or not. Not even sure of what would happen next, Jeff decided to call out to the werewolf 
and take his chances because eventually, the werewolf would have his way with Jeff one way or another. </br>

<br> “D… David… are you still in there?” Jeff asked nervously, his voice cracked and was a bit high pitched. </br>

<br>The werewolf, recognizing his name looked up at Jeff and stared at him. Jeff didn’t know if he should stand perfectly still or run in fear of 
what could happen. The thing was, Jeff knew that it was folly to run because the werewolf was sure to be able to outrun and outmaneuver him 
at every turn. Suddenly, the werewolf before him huffed and Jeff got his answer. </br></p>
