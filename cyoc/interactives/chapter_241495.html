<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Growing up in Animalia, Polly has been aware there&#39;s been a division between the kids&#39; celebrations and the adults&#39; celebrations. When she was younger, she didn&#39;t particularly care about what the grown-ups did. She was having plenty of fun with the children&#39;s activities. But as she got older, she became more curious. She wondered what the grown-ups did that was so fun that the kids couldn&#39;t join in. Polly became less innocent and oblivious with time. Her foster mother gave her &#39;The Talk&#39; when Polly was on the cusp of puberty. Polly began to understand why her brother and Heather wanted alone time. She could sometimes smell when her foster parents or her foster sister have been having adult fun.<br />
<br />
Of course, things changed after last year when she was given her second dose. Now as a fully-grown and bigger-than-average polar bear, she had a better understand of the appeal and draw of sex. Not that Polly was that quick to lose her virginity. She was saving herself for a special someone. Perhaps that would be Teddy one day. But just because Polly wasn&#39;t indulging in sex herself didn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t go to adult parties. She got her first taste of it on Halloween. Now she was going to see what the adult Mardi Gras party was like.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Polly felt rather pumped to be going to the Meat Market on her own. Marcy was too busy right now to accompany her, but Polly was more than big enough to not need a chaperone. And she wasn&#39;t dressed to look underage either. Her tank top had a plunging neckline to show off her impressive cleavage, though it was tight enough around her middle to show off her abs through it. Jean shorts might be a bit out of place this early in March, but polar bears don&#39;t mind the cold at all. Polly wore her hair loose this time, showing that she was ready to party.<br />
<br />
The bouncer didn&#39;t bother to ID her and let Polly in. Polly was a little surprised to hear jazz music being played. But then, Mardi Gras around here tended to draw a lot of influence from New Orleans. The lights were on so Polly&#39;s fur wasn&#39;t purple in here. There were a lot of green, gold, and purple streamers and pendants hanging around. There were bead necklaces of the same colors on all the tables. Her mom had warned Polly want it meant when someone threw beads at women on Mardi Gras. Polly wasn&#39;t about to humor that here.<br />
<br />
The dancers were another story. Camille the chameleon was currently on stage, wearing so many bead necklaces they covered her breasts. At least when she was right-side up. The way she was dancing, the necklaces moved so much that it revealed she was wearing just a pair of pasties under the beads.<br />
<br />
Polly wasn’t particularly interested in the dancers on stage. She was hoping there would be room on the floor to allow people who want to dance. But there wasn’t much room between all the tables. But she could at least enjoy the ambiance, though she’ll have to mind the handsy drunks.<br />
<br />
As Polly was looking for a place to sit, she noticed an elephant waitress carefully walking between the tables. It could only be one of the girls from Desert Flats, but Polly wasn’t sure which one it was. Navigating over there, she waited until the elephant wasn’t waiting on anyone before she said, “Excuse me, miss.”<br />
<br />
The elephant turned to Polly and asked, “Can I help you?” She was wearing a classic cocktail waitress uniform, which consisted of a black skirt and a white shirt with several buttons undone to show her cleavage.<br />
<br />
“I just wanted to talk a moment,” said Polly, “I assume you’re either Chrissy or Marcella.”<br />
<br />
The elephant sighed and said, “I’m Marcella, though I wish I weren’t.”<br />
<br />
Polly nodded and said, “Bit of a rough time to start your community service.”<br />
<br />
“Not to be rude, miss, but I need to keep waiting on people if I want to pay my debts,” said Marcella.<br />
<br />
“Hang on, I’ll take care of this,” said Polly before walking over to the bar. Fortunately, Miss Fabina was currently at the bar. “Miss Fabina, you mind if I talk with Marcella for a while?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Is this part of an Animalia Ambassadoria interview?” asked Miss Fabina.<br />
<br />
“No, completely off the record,” said Polly, “I just think she needs someone to talk to.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, but 10 minutes,” said Miss Fabina, “There are a lot of customers here tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” said Polly before going back to Marcella, “Ok, we’ve got 10 minutes.”<br />
<br />
Marcella looked at the polar bear in front of her properly. She had become pretty tall when she became an elephant, but this polar bear was close to her height. And there was only one polar bear she knew of who was tall and could have any sway with Miss Fabina. “You’re that girl from Animalia Ambassadoria, Polly?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s right,” said Polly.<br />
<br />
“So now what? You want to do an expose on me?” asked Marcella.<br />
<br />
“No, you just look like you need a listening ear,” said Polly.<br />
<br />
Marcella sighed and said, “I guess it couldn’t hurt.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, let’s go someplace where it’s a little easier to talk,” said Polly.<br />
<br />
They went to a table in the corner and Marcella was soon spilling everything. Polly knew that was already going through a lot, what with the justice system wanting to really crack down on her. At least she wasn’t being used as a scapegoat with the terrorism charge. Though hearing that her parents cut her loose was pretty hard to hear.<br />
<br />
“And I know I brought it all on myself,” said Marcella, miserably, “I was just so stupid and petty. I didn’t think of how many lives I’d be ruining, even if I hadn’t gotten infected.”<br />
<br />
Polly nodded before saying, “I can’t understand exactly all you’ve been through. I haven’t had as much trouble with bullies.”<br />
<br />
“Of course not, look at you,” said Marcella.<br />
<br />
“I’ve only been like this for about nine months,” said Polly, “But we don’t have any bullies here. The schools really crack down on anything resembling that.”<br />
<br />
“Not everyone can grow up in a place as nice as Lyre,” said Marcella.<br />
<br />
“True, what I can tell is that you’ve already beaten up about this a lot without everyone else pouring it on you,” said Polly, “I’m not saying you don’t deserve punishment, but I don’t think they need to make you feel worse than you already are.”<br />
<br />
“Why not? My life’s ruined now,” said Marcella.<br />
<br />
“My sister-in-law made bad choices, but she turned her life around,” said Polly, “Your life won’t be the same anymore, but it isn’t over. You still have something to live for after this.”<br />
<br />
Marcella sighed and said, “Thanks, but I’m not sure it’s making feel better now.”<br />
<br />
“I will eventually,” said Polly, getting up, “Just mind your temper in here. It’s a little too easy for girls like us to break groping hands.”<br />
<br />
“That’s what they tell me,” said Marcella.</p>
