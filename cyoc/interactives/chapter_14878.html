<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But wh-Ow!-what?&quot; asked Mark but he barely listened to naked Felix's response.  He had yelped at feeling the electric wave that preceeded a chronivac transformation pass through him.  Oh no!  What now?  And who the hell is using it?<br />
<br />
Mark got up and went to the mirror in Felix's room.  He stared anxiously at the reflection of his naked body.  But nothing changed.  Mark had felt an odd sensation in his brain, but then nothing.<br />
<br />
Felix looked at his friend's brother standing there in front of him and realized that Tina had given him back his body but not necessarily his mind.  He licked his lips at the sight of the nude 14 year old boy.<br />
<br />
In the room down below them, Tina Fairfax switched on her tv set.  The image was her naked brother seen from the side, licking his chops at the sight of naked Mark St. Martin.  She laughed.<br />
&quot;Even if I hadn't programmed you for submission, Marky, your hundred twenty nine pounds would get your ass kicked, or, to be more accurate, filled by my brother Felix and his hundred seventy one&quot;<br />
She glanced at the laptop's screen with a smirk.  The profiles of both her 16 year old brother and Mark St. Martin displayed their sexual preferences, reset to zero on the 0-100 gay to straight scale.  Each profile also showed the results of Tina navigating the advanced sexuality menus.  The love of Felix's life was . . Mark St. Martin.  The love of Mark's life was . . Felix Fairfax. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will tape you getting fucked by Felix, scramble Felix's face in every shot and send out gay porn films of you over the internet to everyone in town.&quot;  she declared with relish.  &quot;I once thought of puttin out a rumor that you were gay after you wouldn't go out with me.  Thanks to the chronivac, I won't have to say a word&quot;<br />
<br />
Back up in his bedroom, Felix understood what Tina had done to him.  Mark was a beautiful boy, slender but incredibly athletic with long legs and a tiny waist a little ass like the two halves of a soccer ball and the chiseled face of a boy model.  Felix wrapped his arms around Mark from behind letting Mark feel his rapidly thickening penis against his velvet soft buns.  <br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
Mark recoiled at first.  He'd realized that he'd changed, but thought maybe he'd been made super arrogant or something from the delight he took in the sight of his own wonderful little body.  He squirmed in Felix's embrace ending up facing him as the two of them wrestled.<br />
<br />
But then he looked Felix in the eyes from an inch apart.  Those blue eyes!  That fair skinned, freckle specked face!  So handsome so . . Mark suddenly realized.  This older boy was his destiny.  He grinned back at Felix and they resumed wrestling, but as play now.  They toppled over onto the bed giggling.  3 inches taller and more muscular Felix eventually pinned Felix onto his stomache.  <br />
Splack!<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
A laughing Mark suddenly felt Felix slap vaseline to his anus.  A moment later Felix was atop him and a moment after that inside him.<br />
&quot;Ahhhhh ahhhhh ahhhhhhh!&quot; Mark gasped at the mild pain of his sphincter stretching to accept beautiful Felix.  Somewhere in his mind, the small minority of his previous hetero identity that Tina had left alive was screaming in rage and humiliation.  Felix was completely gay and reveled in the feel of the skin of incandescent Mark St. Martin's skin under him.  He nibbled at Mark's ear while establishing a rhythm to his thrusts.  He couldn't pull all the way out of him for fear of not easily getting back in.  And Felix didn't want to miss a second of Mark's ecstasy at his G-spot being vigorously rubbed by the head of his penis.  The pleasure was getting to be too much for Mark and he bucked beneath Felix.  Felix asserted his dominance over him by almost painfully holding him down and thrusting harder than ever.  Mark resisted, but . . loved it.  He loved be held down, having pleasure forced on him, having so much pleasure forced on him.  For five more minutes Mark St. Martin gasped with joy as Felix fucked him before finally shooting his warm seed deep inside him.<br />
<br />
Felix rolled off Mark.  Mark cuddled next to him, spooning in front of his dominant partner luxuriating in more muscular Felix's warm embrace.  Mark's old personna put up no objections now.  He turned to say something to Felix and Felix immediately pressed his mouth over his.  <br />
&quot;Mmmmmmmmmpppphhhhhhhhh!&quot;<br />
Mark's eyes went wide at the way Felix plunged his tongue into his mouth and somehow twisted it around his.  <br />
<br />
In the room below, Tina was alternately disgusted, fascinated and delighted, for it didn't stop.  She had laughed raucously at Mr. Ballet Star getting fucked up his ass and loving it like he'd never loved anything before in his life.<br />
<br />
In a minute, she watched as they started again, only this time, Felix put Mark down on his back and grabbed both Mark's heels.  He pushed them straight up into the air.  Flexible Mark's hole suitably exposed, Felix thrust into him eliciting not a gasp of pain as with his first thrust before but a grin of delight.  The lovers were joined again.  Over and over Felix plunged his huge penis into his boy lover, the two of them staring into each other's eyes as they shared their pleasure.<br />
<br />
Tina checked the tape in the morning and laughed.  Perfect.  Just as with the first time, Mark was in the middle of the screen, shown gasping with delight at another boy thrusting his penis into him.  But Tina got much more than that.  They stayed in Felix's room all night.  She reviewd the film from the hidden camera in the morning and fastforwarded through Mark sucking Felix's penis two times, going at it 69 style twice and being reamed out by her older brother 3 more times. <br />
<br />
Her parents never even noticed what was going on.  She'd programmed recognition of Felix's existence to not extend to them.  <br />
<br />
Tina went up to Felix's room.  She didn't knock.  She walked right in.  The two naked boys were half atop the covers, Felix on his back and Mark half atop him, cuddling against his soulmate, a sleeping smile frozen onto his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up boys!&quot; Tina nearly shouted, but they barely stirred, only pulling closer together.<br />
&quot;Wake up!&quot; She commanded and gave a hard slap to Mark's bare buns, the ass she'd watched so intently in ballet class.  Mark grunted and got up and roused Felix by pushing on him to do so.<br />
&quot;Oh, you&quot; Mark mumbled as he stood up naked before her.<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Tina chuckled &quot;Me.  You two enjoy sucking each other's dicks last night&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked slightly worried at her knowledge.  Her brother Felix gave her a hard stare.  <br />
&quot;I knew this was you&quot; he said<br />
&quot;Well, don't worry, Felix&quot; she replied &quot;This isn't about you.  It's about the boy ballet star here who thinks he's too good for anyone but a supermodel.  Maybe you can find a boy supermodel&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix steppedforward and shut the door behind her.<br />
&quot;Look.  I loved that . . because that's what I was.  But you're going to turn both of us back to our normal selves, or actually, I'll do it&quot;<br />
&quot;Doesn't matter&quot; laughed Tina &quot;too late.  I already sent the pictures of Mark St. Martin getting fucked by an anonymous, scramble faced boy and loving it all over the internet.  Everyone in town, everyone in the state, everyone in the country, even the world will know Mark St. Martin as the cocksuckingest boy alive.  How do you like that?&quot; she said triumphantly.<br />
<br />
She waited for a reaction of despair or anger or something, anything but what she actually got.  They smirked and shook their heads.<br />
&quot;I'll go get it&quot; said Felix and he pulled on a pair of boxers before leaving the room.  She looked at Mark St. Martin.<br />
&quot;He can't go get it, you know.  They're gone.  All the pictures are gone.  You getting it up the ass with Felix on top of you.  You getting it up the ass facing him.  That was a good one.  Guess that ballet flexibility comes in handy for a gay boy, huh?  And you probably don't need breakfast with all that semen in you, huh?&quot;<br />
Mark St. Martin sighed.  &quot;You really don't understand the machine, do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
At that point, Felix walked in with the chronivac powered laptop and emitter.  While Mark St. Martin stood in front of the door, Felix navigated the menus for both his and Mark's profiles.  A minute later, each felt an electric wave pass through his body.  Just to check, Felix stared intently at Mark's still naked body.  He was impressed by the slender athleticism but felt no spark of desire at all.<br />
<br />
He looked to his sister with contempt.<br />
&quot;What?  Do whatever you want.  He's still gonna be the most famous flamerboy in the country.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Mark approaching the laptop. Felix disconnected the emitter and got out of the chronivac program.  He connected to the internet and then went to the site where Tina had sent the gay sex footage.  There was nothing there about Mark, none of the footage she'd transmitted.<br />
&quot;But that's impossible!  I sent it myself.  How can-&quot;<br />
Felix was back in the chronivac program now.  <br />
&quot;You can erase the effects of a transformation and continue the time stream as if it hadn't ocurred.  You didn't behave like a little bitch toward Mark.  In fact, even you don't even remember that you tried to do that, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina felt an electric wave pass through her body.</p>
