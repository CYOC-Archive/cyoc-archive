<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The old omega alarm clock ticked to 6:00. A song by Twisted sisters “Were not gonna take it!” started to blare from its speakers. Groggily Derick slapped the alarm off button and pushed the button on his nights stand lamp. It sent a warm soft glow across the bedroom. He thought to himself that was sure one crazy dream and almost unwillingly his gaze glanced to the being at the base of his bed. He saw two eyes gazing back at him. Remy just rested there then it hit him. It wasn’t a dream! His German shepherd had changed into a anthropometric being. “Well, What happens now?” Remy asked. Derick sat there contemplating many scenarios and options flashing through his head. Finally he replied. “I don’t know right now, but lets at least eat breakfast.” He then stood up and turned on the bed room light. Looking over at Remy He noticed how she tried to rise to all fours and apparently finding out that things no longer worked that way. She just laid there. “Here, Let me help.” Derick said walking over to his companion. “Here, give me your.. well.. hand?” Remy clumsily reached out and grasped Derrick’s hand. “This F-feels n-not right.” Remy stated. “Okay now sit up, there you go. Now I am going to pull you onto your feet. Ready?” Derick Asked. Remy said nodded. Derick pulled Remy onto her two feet. Gasping Remy exclaimed. This is so high!” Derick reassured. “Its okay I have got you. Now Remy just focus on balancing.” Derick held Remy’s furry hand for several minutes. Finally Remy seemed to be able to balance herself on here new feet. “Okay Ready?” To which Remy replied. “For what?” Derick replied. “To walk.” Remy replied. “I guess.” “Okay now take one of your feet and move it forward. Okay just like that. Now move your weight onto that foot. Okay.” Derick replied after Remy had made her first step. “Great job!” He exclaimed! “Now lets repeat that alternating both of your legs. I have you for support.” Slowly for several steps they made it towards the door. Remy said. “I have it from here.” “What!” Derick exclaimed. “You have only made it 4 steps.” Remy replied. “This is easy.”  She then let go of Derricks hand. Walking out the bed room door. Leaving Derricks mouth hanging wide open. Recovering he followed her into the kitchen and then living room. “This is easy!” with a bark that sounded like a laugh. Derick said. “Be careful.” Still amazed how she took walking so naturally. Remy commented. “This is soo weird how my legs move now. It seems so natural and not like walking cross legged like before!” Derick Replied. “That’s because your hips are now straight.” Remy stopped, and looked at Derrick. “What do you mean?” She asked. “You had hip dysplasia before” Derick replied. “Ah, that explains it.” Remy replied. Derrick quietly remarked this is amazing look how fast she is learning. She is not even having an issue talking! Remy got excited and asked. “Can we go outside! I wanna run!” Derick said. “It probably would not be wise taking you outside right now.” Remy cocked here head and asked “Why?” Derick replied. “Because, that would not go over very well if you were to be seen in your current condition.” Remy then asked.  “Why would not your kind accept me like before?” Derick paused before replying. “I don’t know. But likely not. I really don’t want to find out yet.” Remmy looked at Derrick and asked. “How am I supposed to relieve myself then?” Derick stood there. “I guess you will just have to use the bath room.” “ The what room?” Remy asked. “The bathroom Derick said again. More to the point the toilet.” Remy asked. What is a toilet? Derrick started “That white seat that.” Remy exclaimed. “Oh I see. It’s the one that I see you sit on some times.” Taken completely off guard Derick confirmed “Yes it is. Do you need to go now?” He then asked. With witch Remy replied yes. Derick then led Remy to the Bath room and instructed her on the use of a toilet. Remy made it clear that she understood. Derick walked out of the bathroom and closed the door behind himself. “Wait!” Remy exclaimed. Derick stopped and asked. “What’s wrong?” Remy asked. “Are you not going to watch and make sure I do it right?” Derick replied. “No Its not normal for other people to watch each other relieve themselves.” Remy replied. “Ah, Okay.” Derick let her do her business and he got a pot of coffee brewing. Normally he was not a coffee drinker, but this morning seemed to be an occasion for the exception. Remy came walking into the kitchen tail wagging side to side with each step. She then proceeded to kneel down and start to go for the water bowl. “Wait!” Derick exclaimed. Remy Paused and asked, “What?” “Here take this.” Derick grabbed a glass and filled it with water from the tap. Remy grasped it and said. “I can’t drink from this like you can.” Derick said. “I know, but at least you don’t have to kneel on the ground. Remy looked at Derick with an appraising look in her eye. Finally she started to drink. Lapping up the contents until sated. Derrick Pulled out two pans from the cupboard and placed them on the stove. Remy just stood there watching and learning. Derick pulled the carton of eggs out, and a tray of sausages out of the fridge and set them on the counter. Pulling down a glass bowl and setting it on the counter he paused. “Do you want to try this?” Derick asked. Remy Paused and let out a laugh. “Why not.” Amazed at how fast Remmy was mastering the English language He directed her on how to break open the eggs and whisk the yokes. Satisfied he then pulled some shredded cheese out of the fridge and said. “Here, add some of this.” Remy grabbed the cheese and put several pinches in the eggs. Derrick complemented. You are doing great. Remy replied it feels so weird using my hands to do this, but this is fun. Derrick directed Remy from a distance until two plates sat on the counter with perfectly prepared scrambled eggs and sausage. “Okay, lets eat Derick proclaimed.” Derrick then proceeded to explain the proper edict for the use of silverware and cutlery. Remy mastered it nearly immediately and consumed the meal nearly as fast as Derick did. Once the meal had been consumed Remy jumped up and grabbed the plates. “I got this.” Was the only thing that she said as she carried them to the sink. She rinsed the dishes and then placed them in the dish washer. Amazed Derick asked. “How do you know how to do that?” Remy simply replied. I saw you do it plenty of times. Still amazed how fast she was learning Derick asked. “What do you want to do?” Remy sat there pondering her options. She then asked. “Can we go out?” Derick thought for several minutes knowing that his options were limited. “I will tell tell you what. Lets pack the trailer and take it camping. I know just the spot where we won’t be bothered.” Remy stood up, tail wagging excitedly. “Really?” She asked. Derick replied. Yes, but we need to get you into some cloths. I know that fur suits you well. But we need you to at least blend in a little.” To be truthful to himself, he had started to become aroused and was slightly unsettled. Not wanting to know what it meant. Here he grabbed a pair of sweats and a t-shirt from the basket on top of the dryer. Here put this on. She pulled on the shirt and sweats with some difficulty. Struggling to get all of her fur comfortably laid down under the garments was a chore. Her tail stuck out right above the waste band of the sweats. This feels wrong. She announced shortly after getting situated. “You will get used to it.” Derick once again found himself saying. “Okay lets go.” It was still early in the morning and the sun was yet to rise so Derick grabbed his old trusted flash light and headed outside to prepare. Once Remy and Derick had finished packing the trailer, a short task. They both got in the truck and drove away in a cloud of dust.</p>
