<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The computer screen flickered to life as soon as you touched the keyboard.  It showed an error: &quot;SCANNER EMPTY&quot; and showed an icon that looked like the open tube.  The girl looked over your shoulder and glanced up at the open tube.  She grinned and walked over to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet it wants someone to stand in here.&quot;  She touched the side of the tube.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  We don&#39;t know what this is gonna do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, it&#39;s not like someone would leave something dangerous just lying around.  I&#39;m just gonna step in for a second.  Let me know if anything changes.&quot;  With that she stepped into the tube.  A door slid shut across the entrance of the tube and you heard her gasp from inside the closed tube.<br />
<br />
The monitor flickered and went black for a moment before flashing up another box: &quot;Donor chamber empty.  Donor reset.  Link enabled.&quot;  A progress bar appeared below the box and started to fill.  Inside the tube, a glow started and the girl called through the door &quot;Whoa, what&#39;s that?  It tickles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your frantically pressed keys on the terminal, to no effect.  The light in the tube intensified and the girl shrieked.  A not unpleasant shriek, but one more of surprise and ecstasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  What&#39;s going on?&quot; you holler at the tube, and rush over and bang on it, trying to pry it open or at the very minimum disrupt whatever it is doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooooh!  Aaaahh!  Ittt... Itttt... I can&#39;t... Aaaaaah!&quot;  Her shrieks echoed out from the chamber.  They echoed between pain and pleasure.  Your blows against the door of the tube had no apparent effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the light went out and for a moment everything was silent.  Then with a loud woosh, the door opened and you saw her standing there in the tube.  Almost exactly how she had looked when she entered.  Her hair was a little frazzled and no longer hung neatly, there was sweat rolling down her forehead, and her cheeks were flushed.  Her eyes stared forward, unfocused, past your head.<br />
<br />
A few seconds past and you reached out and cautiously touched her shoulder.  Her unfocused eyes quickly snapped back to focus, and she finally saw you standing before her.  She blushed, deepening her already red cheeks.  <br />
<br />
You cautiously asked, &quot;Hey, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Yeah.  That was... &quot;  She paused and looked confused.  Something about her voice seemed different now.  It had an odd echo quality to it.  &quot;Uh.  I...  Uh... Hold on a second.&quot;  She closed her eyes and exhaled slowly.  This was something she had done a few times at school, usually just before an exam.  You had never had the courage to ask her about it, but had overheard her explain to a friend that it was a form of meditation, to help her calm down and focus.<br />
<br />
You awkwardly stood there and waited for her to speak again.  The echo in her voice had been otherworldly, but the voice had been undeniably hers, the one you had fallen in love with.  Her meditative pause gave you ample time to look closer at her perfect face.  You wanted to kiss it, so very badly.  Slowly, you reached in.  Closer... closer... Finally your lips were just a hair&#39;s width from hers, your eyes closed in sweet anticipation.<br />
<br />
From behind you her voice rang out, &quot;Oh come on.  Just kiss me already!&quot;  Startled, you opened your eyes to find yourself looking straight into hers.  She leaned forward slightly and met your kiss.  It was everything you dreamed it would be.  You reached around her waist and drew her body close to yours.  She moved with the motion, pressing her breasts up against your chest, and pushed further into your kiss.<br />
<br />
The kiss went on forever, or so it seemed.  Those years of awkwardness and anticipation faded away into a single amazing moment.  You held her close, as if you would die if you didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... finally...&quot;  Her eyes twinkled mischievously and her lips still pressed tightly against yours, having not yet broken their loving contact with your lips.  And yet... you had just heard her speak... from behind you.<br />
<br />
Startled, you backed out of the kiss.  She smiled sweetly and took a half step back.  Her lips didn&#39;t move as you heard her voice again, &quot;I&#39;m glad we came in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, you turned to look behind you, and were shocked to see a second girl standing there.  She was identical to the girl you had just kissed, even down to the flush cheeks and sweaty forehead.  &quot;Uh... surprise!&quot; You glanced back and forth between the 2 identical teens several times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm... What?!&quot;  Your voice carried all the tones of confusion, and all the undertones of fear.  You looked back to the girl that came out of the tube, the one who must be the original.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that machine cloned me.&quot;  This time her lips moved, but her voice had the echo again.  You glanced over at the girl on your other side.  &quot;But I&#39;m..  Uhm, how to put it...&quot;<br />
<br />
It occurred to you that the 2 girls must be speaking at the same time in order to cause the echo.  You reached out and lightly grabbed the 2nd girl by her wrist.  &quot;Can you uh... just stand over here too?&quot;  You guided her to stand next to the original, who was now leaning back against the tube, with a huge grin on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot;  You wiped her face in your hands, barely able to comprehend what you were seeing.  &quot;Going back... This machine cloned you.  HOW?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls shrugged.  &quot;I dunno.  It just did.&quot;  Both girl&#39;s lips moved at the same time, and her voice had the weird echo again.  &quot;It definitely wasn&#39;t cloning like we learned about in biology either.  This is waaaay more advanced.  Sci-fi stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah.  Your clone is the same age and looks identical and... wait, where did those clothes come from?!?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Again both girls shrugged.  &quot;Beats me.  That&#39;s not even the strangest thing.  I&#39;m both me.&quot;  They stopped and watched you expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  What does that even mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
They frowned in unison, &quot;Uhh... That was the best way I could think of to explain it. Erm, give me a sec...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Seconds passed as you stared at your girlfriend and her identical clone.  They seemed to be absorbed in thought.  You thought about what it would be like to have a girlfriend who had a clone.  Would the clone think of you as her boyfriend too?  Would you go on double the dates?  How would birthdays work?  Does this mean you would need to remember two birthdays instead of one?  What if one got jealous of the other?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think I have it.&quot;  The girl leaning against the tube spoke and stood up straight, no echo in her voice because the other girl didn&#39;t speak.  &quot;I&#39;m the original, right?&quot;  You nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;  She smirked and leaned back against the tube.  Immediately the other girl spoke, &quot;Kiss me!&quot;  She quickly embraced you, wrapping her arms around your shoulders and leaned hard into the kiss.  It was more forceful than the kiss you had a few minutes ago, and yet it felt just as loving.  She held the kiss tightly, keeping her lips pressed against yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, I&#39;m kissing you.&quot;  You opened your eyes and looked at the girl kissing you - the clone.  Her eyes darted to the side as if to say &#39;Look at the original, not at me&#39;.  You tried to turn to look at the original, but she held the kiss tight, and only let you turn enough to see the original out of the corner of your eyes.  As you watched, the original spoke, &quot;I feel your lips against mine.  It feels... oh, so amazing.  I can taste your mouthwash.  I can see your eyes in amazing detail.  Because...&quot;  The original stepped forward and grabbed the clone on the shoulder.  &quot;... I am her.  I&#39;m in two places, in two bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl you were kissing slowly backed off the kiss, and looked you deeply in the eyes.  &quot;Do you understand now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
You nodded, and wrapped your arms around her waist to hug her.  She leaned into the hug, and the other girl let out a cute little squeal and held her hands together in excitement.  You held the hug for a few seconds and watched out of the corner of your vision as the other girl turned around and looked at the tube.  Quickly, you reached down and grabbed the butt of the girl you were hugging.<br />
<br />
Both the girl you were hugging, and the one looking at the tube let out an echoed yelp in surprise.  &quot;Hey!  What are..&quot;  The other girl looked back over her shoulder at you, &quot;I hope that means we&#39;re boyfriend and girlfriend and girlfriend now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You laughed.  You and her other body stopped hugging and she slid to your side, her arm wrapped around your waist and her head leaned on your shoulder.  You spoke to your girlfriend(s), &quot;So now that we&#39;re an item and a half... what now?  This isn&#39;t exactly a normal situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea...&quot; echoed as it was spoken from two mouths.</p>
