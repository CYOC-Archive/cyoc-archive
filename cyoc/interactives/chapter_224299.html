<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Simon? Simon! over here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon started, turning his head. Not wanting to let Clark down he&#39;d been in such deep concentration analyzing the costumes that he hardly noticed as three other men had entered the room. His eyes locked onto the apparently source of the voice, someone he immediately recognized.<br />
<br />
&quot;James?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Simon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;James.&quot; <br />
<br />
Simon could hardly keep his eyes from rolling. Of course James was here, James was everywhere there was a party. <br />
<br />
 James was a coworker he&#39;d met about a year ago, and was the closest thing to an excitable puppy he knew in human form. He was always over-enthusiastic about everything and someone who&#39;s excitement almost always translated into pushing Simon - or really whoever else was in his vicinity - into joining him in whatever activity was causing his excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Simon, I&#39;m surprised to see you here! I didn&#39;t know you were on the guest list. I come every year, Mister E sure knows how to throw a party after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its all in the presentation, James&quot; Mister E purred from the corner, James&#39; excitement clearly stroking part of his  ego.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh certainly!&quot; James turned his head back to Simon &quot;Anyway, am I glad to see you! My friends and I were going to attend in a group costume and one of our participants dropped out last minute! We need one more to really complete our group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon studied the boys, only now taking in their costumes. All three were satyrs, differing only in color and horn size. The boys to James&#39; right and left each were shirtless, and sported densely furred legs. The one on the right was clearly an athlete, his well muscled torso a perfect compliment the &#39;satyr-vibe.&#39; The one on the left, was somewhat the opposite, a slight gut formed from the inactivity of adult life. The fur of their legs was striking, the one with the gut&#39;s legs featured a coat of  leafy green; while other more muscled man&#39;s fur Simon could only describe as a rose-like red. While not the typical colors one expects from fur, the shades were somehow at once striking, and distinguishable while somehow maintaining a modest air of &#39;believability.&#39; The last thing Simon noticed, A top the boys&#39; heads were slight horns, not a far cry from the fresh nubs of a new spring. <br />
<br />
James meanwhile, took on a more classic satyr look. His fur was a rich brown while atop his head sat a powerful set of curled rams horns. On one side of his waist was tied an empty drinking horn, and the other, a pan flute. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like the look?&quot; James replied with a delighted smirk, twirling slowly giving Simon a fuller view of the furry tail atop his rear, and the well-designed shape of the legs which somehow managed to fit James&#39; legs into the inhuman bends of animal hindquarters. He patted the drinking horn, &quot;horns empty now, but you better believe Mister E will help us fill it later! I&#39;m a vodka tonic man usually. I don&#39;t really drink wine. never liked the stuff. But something tells me i&#39;ll just be dying for a glass later!&quot; His eyes shined as he gave a sly wink to Mister E.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you Matt? You like wine?&quot; He said, turning to the athletic, red furred man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er-yea, I&#39;m not a big wine guy. Don&#39;t really like it. Started drinking beer at the fret frat, &#39;n haven&#39;t really switched to anything else since. Wine is usually a sorority thing, &#39;n like..something they drink at that theater fraternity. Not really my jam,&quot; Matt Replied. His voice has the somewhat lazy tone of a college jock, something his tight abs and apparent frat membership suggested was probably true. &quot;Why...does it matter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it certainly doesn&#39;t matter! Any don&#39;t worry, you might not be much of a wine-drinking satyr now, but once the party gets going I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get into the wine-loving spirt&quot; His eyes shown again in michevious mirth. Matt meanwhile just looked a little confused - it was an odd question, and an odd reply.  <br />
<br />
James turned back to Simon&quot; Matt&#39;s a senior over at the University&quot; James explained &quot;I met him when he was a freshman and I was a senior, we&#39;ve been friends ever since! He actually had an internship at our office last summer.  Maybe you noticed him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon didn&#39;t remember, but smiled and nodded nonetheless, not wanting to seem rude.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like wine from time to time.&quot; Piped in the green furred, doughier fellow &quot;But I&#39;m not a huge drinker.&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes turned to Simon &quot;I like to game at night after work, drinks usually mess with my reaction time so usually I lay off them. Not a big fan of getting drunk anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er-yea, I get that. I like wine, but I haven&#39;t been drinking much since I got out of college&quot; Simon replied<br />
<br />
&quot;William here is the acquisitions rep at client of mine&quot; James announced, slapping a hand on William&#39;s shoulder. The young man winced slightly at the slap. At work - James was in the sales department, a perfect match for his outgoing personality and general enthusiasm. Naturally, he was great at brining in clients who,  given his friendliness more often than not quickly turned from business relationships to James&#39; fast friends. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you both.&quot; Simon gave the two men small nodes &quot;Costumes looks great James! I take it you all come to this thing annually? &quot;<br />
&quot;yep!&quot;<br />
&quot;This is my first time.&quot; Simon continued &quot; I came with my friend Clark but he seems to have.... run off before I could pick out a costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First time eh?&quot; a sly grin crossed James&#39; face &quot;Thats perfect, this is William and Matt&#39;s first time as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
From behind Matt was busy scratching the fur of his legs, trying unsuccessfully to cut through the dense fabric and ease his discomfort.  &quot;Yea and this thing better be worth it. These costumes are so damn itchy! After the costume contest or whatever it is you need us in these get-ups for is done, I&#39;ll be swapping out these legs for the extra clothes I have over in my car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon noticed James&#39;s grin grow slightly wider, as his coworker and Mister E exchanged a brief knowing look. Mister E quickly matched Simons grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Matt, you just have to get used to these. I grantee in an hour you won&#39;t be complaining about the itchiness anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better not be! Remember I&#39;m here as a favor to complete your group costume, I&#39;m not big on the whole dress up thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I appreciate it deeply  and can assure you will too by the end of the night! I just know you&#39;ll have a blast, and our group will be a big hit!&quot; James replied. His attention quickly turned back to Simon. &quot;Since we have two first timers as well, and Clark seems to have run off, you should just stick with us!&quot; <br />
<br />
Always something of a pushover when it came to James,  Simon hesitated briefly but replied &quot;Er-sure. I guess I don&#39;t have much else going on if Clark ran off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect! You&#39;re willing to put on the hooves and horns of our fourth who couldn&#39;t make it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Er-yea. But can I ask...what is the concept here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;oh! Of course!&quot; James replied, his eyes shining in excitement &quot;Well since I&#39;ve always loved to socialize and party...I figured I&#39;d dress as the god Pan who loves to do the same! And  of course no Pan costume would be complete without his roudy, hedonistic enteroge of satyrs. That&#39;ll be you Matt and Will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense.&quot; Internally, Simon couldn&#39;t help think it didn&#39;t make much sense at all. While James had the fun loving nature of Pan, he certainly didn&#39;t have the animal magnetism, love of nature, or raw masculinity. James was a slight fellow, thin and almost boney and his body was generally hairless. James could never grow much beyond peach fuzz on his face or chest. <br />
<br />
<i> would have made more sense for Matt to be Pan. But I guess James is the one organizing this all </i> Simon thought<br />
<br />
 &quot;Why the odd colors?&quot; Simon Asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just practicality - gotta make sure we&#39;re distinguishable! But as for our characters, I justified it in the backstories I wrote for you all&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Backstories?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Mister E expects all guests come in character, and yes- that means you all need character traits as well&quot; James replied with excitement &quot;As Pan, I&#39;m naturally taking on the classic brown, but for each of you I themed you after an element of the forest! Will&#39;s green represents his connection to leaves and plants, the red of Matt&#39;s represents a connection to the flowers of the forest meadows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I didn&#39;t want the flower one&quot; Matt muttered quietly as James continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you! Well, you&#39;ll just have to see!&quot; James said with a smile, Handing Simon a heavy bag. &quot;Once you are dressed We&#39;ll head in side. And don&#39;t stress about the backstory! Neither Matt or will have read there&#39;s yet. I&#39;m saving them for just before the party starts as a surprise!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon looked at the bag and then back at James. &quot;Uh...sure. This all works I guess&quot; Simon said as he turned to change.<br />
<br />
_____________________________________<br />
<br />
Moments later, Simon emerged from the changing room, the clop of his plastic hooves filling the air. &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic! You&#39;ll be perfect for my ...er...Pan&#39;s entourage!&quot; James replied &quot;Now hurry up, we have to go in as the fun is about to begin. I&#39;m sure there will be a mirror inside for you to get a better look at yourself&quot;<br />
<br />
On that note, Simon felt James ever-encouraging hand gently push him towards the door as the four made their way into the party.</p>
