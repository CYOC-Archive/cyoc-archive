<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hit a lot of hesitation and hastly typing. Jacob rushed to save himself from this misery. He didn&#39;t notice that he had accidentally made made Emily a pleasure machine that would have had a guinness world record of pleasuring moments.<br />
<br />
&#39;I want to be myself&#39; Jacob thought and pressed the enter.<br />
<br />
Jacob threw up as the world around him spinned the most violently as he had ever felt. Whole body in sudden shock made him collapse on the floor. With couple of flashing light and dimming of his eyes he passed out.<br />
<br />
Moments later he started to hear buzzing sounds near him. The first feeling was that he was lying on a bed. Alone. Under planket and pillow under his head. The buzzing started to become much more louder as he regained counciousness.<br />
<br />
&#39;What the fuck is that sound...?&quot; Jacob mutter inside his mind and opened his eyes slowly.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s eyes met with a Silhouette of Emily. There she was. Opposite side of the bed looking at Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emi.. Emily? Is that you?&quot; Jacob asked with huge hesitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye! Big boy, it&#39;s me.&quot; Emily responded. &quot;Ya know how hard it is to clean the gut juice you thankfully left for me on the floor? HUH!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob heard that Emily&#39;s tone was more frustrated. He quickly rose up from the bed and noticed that something was missing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What the-&quot; Jacob said while trying to grab the bed with left arm. Then he noticed that his whole left arm was missing.<br />
<br />
&quot;JESUS! WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN!&quot; Jacob yelled and pointed the missing limb with right arm.<br />
<br />
Emily was calm and lighted up a smoke. Before saying anything to Jacob she puffed a huge smoke into his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know damn well what happened to it. Money. To put it simply.&quot; Emily explained with serious tone. &quot;I know that you are a good for nothing husband of mine for one year. Then you decide to put me on heavy weight ring and then, you know, THEN you decide to have the greatest idea to mess yourself with money business...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily shook her head and looked at his poor husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya damn well know the only reason why we are still together is your huge package what you still got, mhmm?&quot; Emily said while clearly glancing at Jacob&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
As Jacob looked closer to Emily. He noticed that Emily was covered in tattoos. Tobacco, Condom packages and other trinket were holstered in her mini skirt and only three pieces what she had was the skirt, small leather jacket and fishnet shirt under it.<br />
Then again, the mini skirt wasn&#39;t that obvious at first. Emily&#39;s bottom side was wider than elevator door fully opened and her chest was bigger than H-sized bra. You could clearly see that she had taken silicone under those E-sized utters to make them perkier.<br />
<br />
As Emily finished her smoke and flicked the bud to the floor. She started to un-zip Jacob&#39;s pants like it was nothing. For her, this felt pretty normal. Too normal for Jacob&#39;s taste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmmm, Emily dear.&quot; Jacob said and quickly thought and excuse for himself. &quot;I might have a headache. Could you be dear and bring me my laptop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily didn&#39;t listen. She had a goal. A very CHUNKY goal.<br />
<br />
As Emily finally got all the pants off from Jacob. There it was. Even Jacob was amazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy DAMN! That&#39;s... That&#39;s like 10 inches long...&quot; Jacob said outloud.<br />
<br />
Emily was ready to sink her head into this meat golem until the door in the room banged wide open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie... Jackie...&quot; A man with round hat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;CARLOS! Just! UNF!&quot; Emily pouted. &quot;I wanted my last meal before you show up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up whore.&quot; Carlos said. &quot;You had your free buffet for past year-and-half.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlos took a revolver out from his pocket and pointed it at Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before this lead spits onto your face. I am going to ask you as simple question.&quot; Carlos commanded &quot;What. Happened. To. My. Money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get my computer and-&quot; Just before Jacob could finish his sentence. A loud bang interrupted him. He felt a sharp pain in his right foot and after a couple of seconds it registered inside Jacob&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAHH!&quot; Jacob started to yell while Emily panicked.<br />
<br />
Quickly Carlos rushed towards Jacob and shut his screahing hole with a planket&#39;s edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;...now Jacob. We don&#39;t want to attract too much attention in here. Now do we?&quot; Carlos said while spinning his gun in front of Jacob and Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want this?&quot; Carlos asked while pointing an old laptop with his gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let see if you can deliver your last package this time, while I keep very close eye on you.&quot; Carlos continued while gesturing to Emily to bring the laptop to Jacob&#39;s lap. &quot;And no funny business. That means swift end for both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jacob opened the computer. He could smell Carlos&#39;s whiskey stench and gun&#39;s smoke up in his nose.<br />
<br />
It still ran the software and quickly Jacob searched Carlos&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
With Swift movement he made sure that Carlos had no more bullet&#39;s in the gun and didn&#39;t have spare to left. Then he made sure that Emily had a little bit more muscle to handle Carlos.<br />
<br />
With quick one liner. Jacob said: &quot;Here&#39;s your rewards. Bitch!&quot; and pressed the enter.<br />
<br />
As the apartment quickly run all the lights. Carlos still hadn&#39;t moved an inch. He was no sweating much more than he used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;EMILY! There&#39;s no bullets in his gun. Grab him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily lunged at Carlos with no fear like a luchador and crushed Carlos&#39;s neck with a german suplex move.<br />
<br />
As Emily rose up from the floor. She wiped little dust from her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MAMA!&quot; Jacob shouted as he saw very muscly amazonian at front of him.<br />
<br />
With a very mature and deep voice, Emily responded: &quot;You know what they say, don&#39;t bring a gun into a fist fight...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s body put even high-end athlete&#39;s to shame. She had so much muscles that even her muscles had tiny muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Carlos might be dead, dear...&quot; Emily said while lifting Carlos&#39;s round hat. &quot;You know that we should just run.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a swift movement Jacob rose from the bed and took the laptop into his left arm.<br />
<br />
&#39;Left arm?&#39; Jacob thought. &#39;What happened to it in first place?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jacob had no time to to waste and rushed from the mini apartment complex to the outside while Emily run behind her.<br />
As Jacob felt much more safer. She opened the computer and checked couple of things out from his computer....</p>
