<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake glanced back up at the photo of himself and his father.  When Jake had made himself older, his father grew older as well, changing along with him.  This made Jake wonder.  What if he made changes to his dad.  Would they reflect on himself?  Well, there was really only one way to know for sure.  First, though, Jake needed to scan in a picture of his father.<br />
<br />
Jake grabbed the photo of him and his dad that was pinned up on his bulletin board.  He scanned it in to his computer, returned to the Chronivac&#39;s main menu and selected the &quot;Browse&quot; function.  He then selected the scanned in picture from his hard drive.<br />
<br />
He could see the original photo of himself he had taken earlier with the webcam in the sidebar.  Now, however, it depicted his current 25 year old self.  Suddenly, next to it, appeared the photo of him and his father, but it had been cropped to only show his father&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
A spinning 3D model of his father appeared.  Naked, of course.  Jake was a little caught off guard.  It was very strange to see a naked computer model of your own father.  Especially after you&#39;d aged him several years.  The information fields filled themselves in with his father&#39;s stats:<br />
<br />
Name: Joseph Francis Williams<br />
Age: 51<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Species: Human<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;10&quot;<br />
Weight: 187<br />
Build: Average<br />
Occupation: Accountant<br />
Misc Options:-<br />
<br />
Looking over his father&#39;s options, Jake wanted to do something that wasn&#39;t an age change this time.  Something that could be passed down with genetics.  Looking in the mirror again, Jake noted that his father had never really been a hairy guy, something he&#39;d inherited.  But if could maybe....<br />
<br />
Not seeing an obvious field for body hair, Jake clicked the Misc Options.  A whole new sidebar opened up, detailing the most minute aspects of his father&#39;s body.  Everything was there, from his eye color to the rate his toenails grew.  Jake felt a little overwhelmed and began to wish that there was some sort of search function.  He was just about to give up before he finally found a section detailing body hair.  It was a series of drop down menus ranged between None, Minute, Some, Average, Thick, and Extreme.  There was a General setting, which Jake assumed controlled the body hair overall, and breakdowns for each area of the body: the chest, the back, the stomach, the forearms, etc.  Not wanting to spend all day going through menus, Jake merely selected the General tab and changed it from &quot;Some&quot; to &quot;Thick&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake then hit the green &quot;Go&quot; button and a message popped up.  &quot;Alter World to Fit?&quot;  Seeing as how this was the crux of his experiment, Jake clicked &quot;Yes&quot;.  Fairly quickly, he could see changes happening to the computer model of his father.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Joseph was watching his show.  He felt a faint itching sensation on his stomach and he absentmindedly scratched it.  Under his shirt, hair began to pop up from his skin.  Soon, there was a forest of salt and pepper grey and brown hairs covering his stomach.  The trail of hairs shot of to his chest, densely covering it as well.  The spread continued up to his shoulders, where the hairs then shot down his back and arms and generously covered his legs.  Hairs popped up from under neath his collar in the front and back.  His face, though clean shaven, now had a near permanent five o&#39;clock shadow from the thickness of his facial hair.  However, Joseph didn&#39;t notice a single thing.  In fact, as far as he was aware, he had always been a rather hairy bloke, just as his own father had been.  He reached up with a hair covered hand and scratched at his thick stubble.  He wondered how Jake was getting along, and just what was in that package of his?<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Jake couldn&#39;t help but let out an impressed whistle as the model updated.  His father looked like a very hairy man, now.  He was partway curious just how far the &quot;Extreme&quot; setting would have taken things.  He was distracted from the thought as he felt an itching sensation come across his stomach.  He pulled his shirt off once again to watch the changes in the mirror.  Already there was a thick covering of brown hairs across his abdominal.  The hair then quickly covered his chest.  He felt an odd tingle sensation as the flow of hair then moved down his back.  He reached behind himself and felt the new hair there.  It was so strange, yet oddly familiar.  Much like his father, and arms followed suit, and a thick five o&#39;clock shadow covered his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow,&quot; Jake muttered.  So it did work both ways.  Well, within reason, of course.  <br />
<br />
He picked up the photo of him and his dad.  It didn&#39;t really look all that different.  Though, he could make out the thick hair own both his own and his father&#39;s arms, the tufts of hair poking out of the fronts of their shirts, as well as the five o&#39;clock shadows they both bore.  Curious, Jake pulled out his high school yearbook, which was a trip all to itself as he&#39;d never really been to high school.  He found some pictures of himself and saw he was hairy in them, too.  Though, slightly less than he was now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.  This thing is thorough.&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
He glanced back at the Chronivac.  What to change next?</h3>
