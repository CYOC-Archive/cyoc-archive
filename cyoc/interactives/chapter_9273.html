<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty stopped in the hall and thought for a second....&quot;You know, I can't really leave James like that....go to class and I'll meet you there.&quot;  Dustin nodded and continued on to class.<br />
<br />
Reentering the room, he saw the pair still standing there, completely shocked at their mutual transformation.  Ty said &quot; I think that you two should spend more time together.  As a matter of fact, I think that you two will need each other, and that you both should become lovers.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Both men shuddered briefly, then began looking at each other, in a different light.  Ty walked up to James and whispered in his ear: &quot;Look at him, his body.  Its turning you on isn't it boy?&quot;  Mr. Williams/James just nodded, unable to fight the new urges taking control of him.<br />
<br />
&quot; Look at his cock, his manhood.  Its big, and powerful.  You want to touch it, to lick it, to suck on it.&quot;  James couldn't fight the thoughts...he wanted it, to embrace his former body's legs and bury his face over that beautiful cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to drink his seed too.  His milk...you NEED to. You love its taste and its power. You need to please your lover!  You want to bury your face in those pubes and sniff the musky scent there.  Every time that you smell his maleness, you will forget ever being a man and you will feel like the boy you are now.  You will give yourself over to this man and you will be content with your new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
James was crying now.  He used to be a straight 41 year old bachelor, and now he was being turned into a gay 18 year old!<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, why the tears Mr. Will...I mean James!&quot; Ty said snidely.  &quot;You wish you were as big and powerful as him, huh?  Well you aren't!  You are submissive to him.  He is man and you are boy.  Look at his chest, covered with manly hair.  His full beard.  Remember it rubbing your face as he kisses you.  The feel of his chest hair as it rubs against you in bed.  Look at his armpits, full of hair, and smell that scent!  That's the scent of manhood.  Breathe it in boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
James/John Williams body was already smelling quite musky and strong because as a boy, James really didn't need deodorant, but as a man, Mr. Williams wore it religiously.  <br />
<br />
Mr. Williams/James did as he was told and breathed in.  His 18-year old mind reeled and fogged over as the strong musk from John permeated his mind.  He then blinked and wondered why he was crying, and why was his lover standing naked in front of him.  As Ty had commanded, he had forgotten, briefly, his former life, and was now completely the 18-year old gay slacker boy who only wanted to submit to the love of his manly lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I want to see,&quot; Ty said as he looked down and saw the boy's erection leaking pre-come. &quot;One last thing: you need to feel your man enter you.  Remember how good it feels when his manhood slides into you.&quot; Mr. Williams, now completely, if briefly, the young James, shuddered as the physical memory of his lover John's manhood entered his ass and the warm feeling spread across his pelvic region.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I want you to get dressed and go get into Mr. William's car.  You both need to go home and learn your new roles.  But first...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty walked over to James/Mr. Williams and began to whisper to him: &quot;Look at James, his lithe body.  He is just becoming a man now.  Look at the thin hair under his arms, his pubes over his uncut cock.  His soft face, just covered in peach-fuzz.  Its turning you on.  You want to hold him, to caress him, to make love to him.  Imagine it!&quot;<br />
<br />
James/John Williams felt his now large manhood begin to swell as the new memory of lying with his beloved James took hold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice piece James!&quot; Ty said. &quot;Now, I want you to look at yourself.  Look at your manhood.  You are a man now.  Look at you chest, your manly hair, your broad shoulders, your full beard.  Look at your arms, they are muscular and strong like the man you are now.  Look at the hair in your pits.  Thick and virile.  You are a man now.  Smell your scent under your armpits.  This is the scent that you have had since puberty 25 years ago.  It is strong and manly, like you are.  Whenever you smell it you will forget for a while that you were recently a boy and you will remember being a powerful, virile strong gay man who is deeply in love with his 18 year old lover.  You will want to fuck him and have him suck you off while you gently stroke your lover off.  You are powerful and strong and you will feel like it now.  Smell your scent John!”<br />
<br />
James/John Williams raised his powerful arm and buried his nose in his musky pit.  His mind swam as all the memories of being the 18-year old James faded and the memories of being a strong and virile (and horny!) man took hold.  His large piece swelled and pre-come dripped off of it as the thoughts of fucking his lover filled his mind.  The physical memory of rubbing his lover’s boyish prick while rubbing his much more powerful body against the boy’s made his skin tingle with pleasure and his now massively erect cock bounce with excitement.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the now fully regressed Mr. Williams/James, saw his lover’s manhood swollen with lust.  He couldn’t fight it, he needed to suck on it, to nurse it, to draw the seed forth from his manly balls.  James rushed over and dropped on his knees and slipped his lover’s prick in his mouth, as if it had always been there.  John’s scent filled his mind again and a wave of contentment filled his mind.  This was his life’s purpose: to be John’s lover for all time. <br />
<br />
John looked at his young lover and felt a surge of power and masculinity.  His hips began to sway  and thrust, forcing his huge cock in and out of his lover’s small mouth.  He could feel his orgasm rising as his lover tongued the ultra-sensitive spot at the base of his cock-head as he always did.  “How does he always get this right?” John though.  Just then he grunted in a deep voice as his massive orgasm took hold.  His scent again hit his nostrils and he grunted again: his lover almost gagging on the rich cream filling his mouth .  John now knew his destiny as his orgasm peaked: he was to be a good protector to his young lover and cherish his body always as they lived their lives together.<br />
<br />
Ty was startled by the sex act between the two men.  He hadn’t really expected his suggestions to cause quite a strong effect.  “Ok guys, go get dressed.  You both need to go home and get your lives in order together.  Don’t worry about being missed, I’ll take care of that.  Just go home and see what ‘comes up’” Ty chuckled.  With that, Ty left the room and the two lovers to dress themselves and head home.</p>
