<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Samantha and Akane talked and tried to console Jenny, the Mayor and Harry walked down to the employee break room so they could have some privacy for their chat. The Mayor treated Harry to drinks out of the vending machines, and then sat down to talk.<br />
With a few probing questions, the Mayor found out more about Harry and Jenny. While the couple had only met at the beginning of this semester, freshman year for both of them, they had hit it off immediately and had been going out together as class schedules and homework assignments permitted.<br />
Then Harry told the Mayor a more PG rated recap of their weekend at Moon Lake, ending with Harry accompanying Jenny in the ambulance ride here.<br />
<br />
When Harry finished, the Mayor took a sip of his decaf coffee and said, &quot;Of course the town will make full monetary restitution for the tent and Ms. Harper&#39;s lost possessions, but there are other matters of more importance to discuss right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;That first part doesn&#39;t matter. The tent wasn&#39;t mine anyway. I borrowed it from a friend,&quot; replied Harry, staring at his untouched diet soda.<br />
&quot;I will still see to it that the lost items are replaced,&quot; promised the Mayor, &quot;and the town will be covering <b>all</b> of Ms. Harper&#39;s medical bills.&quot; <i>It&#39;s the least we can do, especially if it saves us from another potential law suit.</i> &quot;But Jenny&#39;s future and your own are my main concern at the moment Mister Jenkins. How much do you know of Jenny&#39;s current status at the moment?&quot;<br />
&quot;Everyone keeps telling me that her transformation is incomplete, but despite offering to help, apparently only the rogue that infected her can complete the process,&quot; said Harry.<br />
&quot;True. Sadly, until that happens, Ms. Harper will have no control over her transformations. From dusk to dawn she will involuntarily become a werefox, or were-vixen, which is the correct term for the female gender, until the process is completed. When that happens, Jenny will not only have complete control over when or if she decides to change, but will also have complete control of her mental faculties once more.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean Jenny&#39;s insane now?&quot; asked Harry in a state of shock.<br />
&quot;Not exactly. Until the process can be officially completed, finishing it will be the only thing on Ms. Harper&#39;s mind when she is in her furry state. Like the single mindedness a salmon possesses to get upstream, or the basic instinct of most birds to fly south for the winter,&quot; explained the Mayor.<br />
&quot;To have sex with this Yvette person to become whole again, despite the fact she&#39;s never even been bi-curious.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. After that, other than being a were, Jenny will be herself again for all intents and purposes. Her human health and appearance will be better than before. Otherwise, same personality, intelligence, likes and dislikes, everything that makes her who she is. Mrs. Twist and Tachibana no Akane, the leader of the werefoxes, are talking to her now and trying to ease her transition into were society.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the part I don&#39;t get, sir. I&#39;ve been a citizen of Moon Lake for years, and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever heard of a rogue were. Where is she? Why is she the way she is? Will whatever reason why she is rogue affect Jenny?&quot; asked Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;To take your questions in reverse order: You will have to ask Ms. Akane. Her lawyer suspects a medical imbalance of some type but I honestly don&#39;t know, and we&#39;re searching for her right now. I can tell you that the other person she changed against his will turned out fine once his transformation was completed; and that she will be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of our laws once she is captured,&quot; promised the Mayor.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all well and good, but what happens to Jenny?&quot;<br />
&quot;Part of that is up to you.&quot;<br />
&quot;ME?&quot;<br />
&quot;Amongst the options being presented to Ms. Harper will be the opportunity to become a full citizen of Moon Lake and Skulk society, with all ranks and privileges. Why and how she became a were are not as important as what happens next. Once her transformation is completed and she&#39;s had time to rest and think things over, Jenny will have some decisions to make,&quot; said the Mayor. &quot;Like whether or not to stay in Moon Lake, because if she does go back home, she will have to hide who she is now and be more careful around others than she used to. One accidental bite or scratch, or sexual encounter and that person will become a were too and our secret&#39;s out. The Federal government would invade our otherwise peaceful community and all its citizens would be in cages within a matter of days,&quot; he added, before crushing his empty Styrofoam coffee cup in his bare hand.<br />
&quot;The only were I want to see in a cage is the one who did this to her,&quot; said Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I. Now then, if Jenny does decide to stay in Moon Lake, she will need a friend to help and stand beside her,&quot; said the Mayor, while looking at Harry more closely.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m more than her friend,&quot; Harry replied.<br />
&quot;Do you know about a fox&#39;s life bond?&quot;<br />
&quot;In high school biology, they said that a fox mate&#39;s for life. Once that happens, neither fox ever goes looking for another mate for the rest of their lives, even if their partner passes away before they do,&quot; answered Harry.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true, and the same rules apply to werefoxes as well,&quot; revealed the Mayor. &quot;Ms. Tachibana lost her mate long ago, but while legally she could remarry, Akane has never sought to do so.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; replied Harry, truly impressed.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to check with Akane to see if I&#39;m correct, but if what I suspect comes to pass, considering how long the two of you have been dating, when Jenny&#39;s transformation is completed, she will form a life bond with you, <i>not</i> the rogue.&quot;<br />
&quot;REALLY?&quot; said Harry in disbelief.<br />
<br />
This was the most important question. &quot;How do you <i>truly</i> feel about Jenny Harry?&quot; asked the Mayor.<br />
There was no pause or hesitation in Harry&#39;s voice as he said, &quot;I do love her sir. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not sure our relationship is at the point to start thinking about engagement rings or a marriage license yet, but I have been true to her from the moment we first met. There were a few dates and crushes in high school, but Jenny&#39;s my first real girlfriend, and I know there wasn&#39;t anybody current in her life before me. We&#39;ve been practically inseparable ever since.&quot;<br />
&quot;Despite this were business, it sounds to me like the beginning of beautiful relationship,&quot; said the Mayor. &quot;I fell in love with my wife from the moment I first saw her, but because I&#39;m a were, Melissa was hesitant at first until the day she finally said yes, and didn&#39;t become a were herself until our wedding night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you suggesting that...&quot;<br />
&quot;Only that the two of you wait until things have settled down before having a good long talk with each other about the future,&quot; said the Mayor, as he felt his cellphone vibrate. He took it out of his shirt pocket, and saw the text message that said &#39;A SAYS J BONDING 2 H. U CAN COME BACK IN NOW.&#39;<br />
Putting the cellphone back in his pocket, he added, &quot;The two of you had a good thing going before that damn rogue interrupted things. Don&#39;t let her ruin your relationship. Who knows, in time, you and Jenny might be able to take it to a whole new level. Now then, I think we&#39;ve been gone long enough. We better go check on Jenny, don&#39;t you?&quot; asked the Mayor, as he got up to throw his crushed cup away.<br />
Harry got up and followed him back to his girlfriend&#39;s room, leaving his untouched soda on the table behind him.</p>
