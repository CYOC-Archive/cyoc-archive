<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The werewolf huffed and Jeff backed up, fearing for life and limb, possibly even his species if this got particularly bad. He looked around for anything that could be used as a weapon. For all that Jeff enjoyed watching a transformation happen, he&#39;d usually seen it happen in porn or other significantly distant medium. To actually see a snarling beast right before him it substantially woke Jeff up from how he had been feeling. He...he could honestly get hurt during this. He realized that now. And so Jeff desperately asked again, &quot;D-David...cmon, it&#39;s uhh, the guy you were gonna serve pizza to! Jeff! And uhh, think of your girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever combination you have if that can get through to---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...urgh...I&#39;m...&quot; David choked out, obviously having trouble articulating with his new lupine snout as opposed to his more humanoid form. And it was obvious to Jeff that David was yearning to move and snap and indulge his new wolf-like instincts. But the human within was stronger than the wolf&#39;s instincts. &quot;...I&#39;m still David. I&#39;m still in huhh...in here.&quot; He said after some great difficulty with his words. This almost made Jeff calm down and stop going for the steak knife.<br />
<br />
Almost, because David then very well lunged forward briefly before managing to stop himself, grunting and groaning, snapping at the air with his muzzle. Jeff pressed himself up against the counter, and exhaled over and over, almost well hyperventilating from the fright. David stated, &quot;S-Sorry man...I&#39;m still reckoning with---with my urges. It&#39;s so difficult. FUCK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked him, edging closer to the werewolf but still keeping himself ready to move if David snapped into action like that again, &quot;Urges...? What do you mean, man? Is there something going on in your mind?&quot; Jeff had just thought he&#39;d be able to hook up with a hot former linebacker now pizza delivery dude. Now? Now he was in a state of going from panic to panic. If Jeff still had a boner, it was a consistent fear boner if nothing else. Pretty difficult to experience attraction in the midst of such danger.<br />
<br />
David explained, &quot;It&#39;s like my---my mind is telling me I need to...expand my pack. Like I&#39;m &quot;the alpha&quot; and I need to expand my Huntpack. But I&#39;m...like, still in here. Urgh...fuck, its difficult to talk with this muzzle.&quot; David visibly snarled and fought off another surge of lupine instinct, and Jeff watched him try and calm himself down...but it was becoming increasingly difficult inside of this building. Visibly so, because it seemed David started to rankle at the closeness of the walls and ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m also starting to feel not exactly at home uhh, indoors...gotta run around and assert my---oof fuck, I think that&#39;s more instincts.&quot; David was visibly struggling to maintain his humanity even amidst such obvious bestial immersion. And Jeff sympathized, seeing that he was responsible for David&#39;s state. If it wasn&#39;t for the damn Chronivac, David would&#39;ve been free to just do his job, maybe something else if he consented to it, and then leave. But no. It loaded this horror movie prompt, and now Jeff was left in this position.<br />
<br />
So he intended to make up for it by supporting David however he needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...if you need anything...&quot; Jeff started, almost hoping he could go out with David once the circumstances calmed down. Maybe once David reverted to human. After all, he was an utter hunk as a human...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dude...&quot; David started, snapping his jaws, &quot;I gotta focus on...making sure I don&#39;t hurt anybody like this. Like...also, you&#39;re 16 right? That&#39;s pretty underage in this area. I&#39;m bi and all, so...maybe uh, call me up in two years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, and of course Jeff forgot the age thing. He sighed, of course - but he knew if he could get the Chronivac under control maybe he could indulge with David on his own time. After all, if he could get that under control, he had all the time in the world. Looking outside, Jeff realized the backyard led to a wooded area...and he would also need to get David the Werewolf out before his parents got back in. That was a whole &#39;nother headache he hadn&#39;t even thought of.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, let&#39;s head outback. My uh backyard leads to---&quot; Jeff started just in time for David to catch his meaning and immediately barrel down on pure instinct, running upon all fours heading for the backdoor to the house. Jeff followed after as quickly as he could, and saw the backdoor swung open and the werewolf standing back up outside. Thankfully the neighbors were probably busy, and nobody really used the backyards out here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haah, this is so much better.&quot; David said as he looked around, &quot;F-Fuck...&quot; He looked at Jeff and then out at the woods, &quot;Still feel the need to get some more people into my pack. And my instincts out here feel stronger...maybe this was a mistake.&quot; David suddenly seemed to hear something out in the woods and his ears perked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What is it, David?&quot; Jeff asked, now worrying that taking David out here was probably gonna make his problems worse. How long would David stay basically the same David? It just seemed everything Jeff did took him from one frying pan out into the fire. He noted that David seemed to be scanning the air for something. He knew enough about wolves to know that was how they acted when they detected...a prey animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dude...smelled a deer nearby. I-I&#39;m burning hungry man...&quot; The werewolf snarled and then looked out at the woods, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back. I need to eat that fuckin&#39; deer.&quot; Not even waiting for Jeff&#39;s response, David launched into a run into the backyard woods. Sure there were deer out there, Jeff saw them sometimes wander into the yard at night, but that wooded area led into a more densely forested place. Would David come back at all?<br />
<br />
Jeff took a seat on the porch and morosely pressed his hand into his chin. What started as something that seemed fetishistic and fun had turned out to be a lot of work. And the guy in question had a life and morals and complications that made him more than just an object or an image for Jeff to adore. He would need to work tirelessly on fixing things up with the Chronivac and reverting David to being a normal human. It was the only truly responsible thing to do.</p>
