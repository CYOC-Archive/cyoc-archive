<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">like the previous times her changes were barely noticeable while in human form. once again she found herself more of a carnivore than before all this started. at school, her sense of smell had become more refined. she could now smell the scents of her fellow students. for some reason, she smelled an odd perfume or something from Sarah that she didn&#39;t know where it came from.  <br />
<br />
at lunchtime, her meal was mostly meats and proteins. gym class was the most fun she had yet. she felt like she had to hold back to keep people from figuring out something was different. after school she waited for Sarah. &quot;so where do you want to go?&quot; Kira asked as she and her friend met up.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ve been to the mall recently. so that&#39;s out and no cave so we can&#39;t go there. how about we just hang out at your place.&quot; Sarah said. Apart from being a little nervous, Kira agreed. hopefully, she could avoid accidentally touching her totem. &quot;yeah let&#39;s hang out&quot; she said trying to hide her nerves.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
as they entered the house Kira couldn&#39;t help but smell something about Sarah. it was hard to describe but it reminded her of her scent sometimes. &quot;so are you gonna finally show me the totem. if we can&#39;t go to the cave then I can at least see something from it,&quot; Sarah said. Kira hid her nerves as she agreed. &quot;sure sounds like a plan&quot;.   <br />
<br />
the two soon walked up the stairs. for some reason, she and Sarah had similar scents. As they entered the room Sarah immediately approached the totem. &quot;oh my gosh it&#39;s just like great grandpa described it. although it looks broken?&quot; Sarah commented as she saw the delicate statue.  <br />
<br />
thinking of something quick she said, &quot;Oh yeah it&#39;s very fragile. It might break if you touch it&quot;. trying to change the topic Kira thought of something. &quot;how old were you when your great grandfather told you about the totem. this time the smell increased as Sarah tensed up. &quot;well that&#39;s the thing,&quot; she said now nervous.  <br />
<br />
It then clicked to Kira that she had been smelling an emotion, but what could make her friends so nervous. she got her answer as the raven-haired girl calmed down. &quot;he told me about it last month&quot; she said. confusion could be seen on Kira&#39;s face as she muttered a quick &quot;What?!&quot;. &quot;you see great grandpa found the totem as I said. However over several days.... well he changed. he then passed on that trait to his three kids&quot; Sarah said.  <br />
<br />
She began to strip as she continued. &quot;I first changed last full moon. while not a necessity, it seems any non-mythical animal would mean you could were-animal at will&quot; Now completely naked she closed her eyes. her body began to grow. muscles filled out her hourglass form and turned it into a muscular v.  <br />
<br />
Her breasts receded as fur covered her entire body.  it was light brown on her limbs, eyes, ears, and part of her sides. dark brown fur now covered her back and the top of her thighs. tan fur now covered her muzzle, inner ear front, and... balls. a long fluffy tail grew above his ass as his cock slipped out of its sheath.  <br />
<br />
dark brown fur soon appeared on his ankles and elbows as his feet became paws and his hands looked somewhat similar. his raven hair turning dark brown as it sunk into a fluffy mass now covering his neck. a thick treasure trail grew over his abs and connected to his fluffy mane. his cock finally revealed itself fully. it was larger than any human and most animals. in her human form, she doubted she could even grab it with two hands.  <br />
<br />
his balls were also large they hung to his knees. the beast finally opened its Heterochromia eyes. The blue and green orbs sow slit somewhat. &quot;I knew this was coming as my brothers had become were-animals too&quot; his voice now deep with a slight growl to it. &quot;after hearing the story as was my right after the first change I knew...&quot; The beast&#39;s facial features now looked scared as he continued.  <br />
<br />
&quot;...that you would be perfect for a totem yourself,&quot; Sarah said as his cock slipped back into his fluffy dark brown sheath. Kira could now smell fear heavy on her friend&#39;s form. &quot;wait what do you mean?&quot; Kira asked suddenly a little upset as to the true reason she was told to find the cave. &quot;*sigh* Kira we&#39;ve been best friends since kindergarten. Would you really think I wouldn&#39;t know about your love of masculine things&quot; While he was still a bit nervous Sarah&#39;s words rang true.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you...&quot; Kira said only to get stopped by her friend. &quot;Sarah I have a great nose. even before I changed. I could smell how you felt about certain things. The way you faked loving things like nail polish and buying dresses.  <br />
<br />
I could smell your real love of the outdoors and exercise. however, I know that if I told you the truth you&#39;d think I was a psycho or worse,&quot; he said. That last sentence was what Kira had been afraid of. &quot;so Sarah, it um... changes you into a male were-creature?&quot; she asked wondering if she had picked something else out then maybe she would still be purely female. her now 7-foot friend shook his head and chuckled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Firstly it&#39;s Sam. Second no it doesn&#39;t. it is influenced by your desires. for me, I wanted to be a werewolf and be a part of my family&#39;s pack. I also wanted to get closer with my brothers. so when I changed I became a male werewolf. speaking of I showed you my were-form can I see yours?&quot; Sam said.  <br />
<br />
Sighing Kira closed her eyes and focused. her clothes now torn. &quot;hmm... looks like you&#39;re not quite there yet. I suppose it&#39;s gonna take to the thing is gone for it to finish&quot; he said as he eyed the totem. &quot;also my recommendation is to change before you &#39;change&#39; if you catch my drift&quot; Sam was now acting like a man and a beast at the same time.  <br />
<br />
his tail wagging like the canine he was. &quot;yeah I don&#39;t think I&#39;m there yet,&quot; Kira said. Sam changed back to Sarah and said &quot;Well when you&#39;re all done you&#39;ll get some rights&quot;. once Kira was human she asked, &quot;What kind of rights&quot;. her friend smelled of happiness now. &quot;well one is your were-name once I changed I chose a manly version of my name. however, you can pick any name. Usually, an initiation happens on the full moon, but since you&#39;re the first were-lion of your family...&quot; she gestured to the woods.  <br />
<br />
&quot;...you can make your own initiation. oh before I forget there&#39;s one extra nifty thing&quot; Sarah said before closing her eyes. This time she grew but to fewer extremes. She now was the masculine equivalent of Sarah. Kira recognized the person in shock.  <br />
<br />
&quot;wait Samuel?&quot; she said as she saw who she thought was Sarah&#39;s cousin. &quot;yep were the same person. whenever I want to hang out as a man in public I just say I&#39;m my cousin. once you&#39;re done you can do it too&quot; he said. The two of them then talked about everything. ranging from girly things to their sudden cravings for meat. Eventually, it was turning dark outside. &quot;well I better get going,&quot; Sarah said as she left.  <br />
<br />
&quot;tell your mom I enjoyed her dinner,&quot; she said as she left. a howl was soon heard a minute after the front door closed. Kira now found relief as many of her questions were answered. she now lay down almost too excited to go to sleep. She would choose her rights this full moon.  <br />
<br />
falling asleep she was soon bathed in the totem&#39;s eyes glow once again. the cracks on its face began to connect and the left side of its face came off. the stone and crystal fell to the ground and broke into dust. the dust then glowed and went to Kira&#39;s sleeping form...</p>
