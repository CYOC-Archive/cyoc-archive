<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd and Gretta cuddled together on the janitor&#39;s patched and torn up old leather sofa. With the TV blaring, the two were perfectly concealed. If somebody had entered the room just then they would have seen a big naked crocodile woman and a human sporting a nice boner in his pants snuggling and nuzzling each other as the crocodile continued her slow shrinkage and regression.<br />
<br />
Todd kissed the crocodile every once in a while, starting another make out session, and Gretta would respond in kind as her body began to lose its muscle and deflate. All of her was starting to lose mass now, as she fell into her crocodillian twenties her plump breasts began to shrink down. She had fallen under six feet, standing about 5&#39;8&quot;, and was looking quite a bit more petite now. Her big arms and thick legs were much leaner, and her body was taking on the feminine shape of a young lady.<br />
<br />
Still the human and crocodile kissed and made out, caressing each other in their arms, until Gretta hit twenty and jolted. Todd paused to look at his reptile lady and they both stared in wonder. She was really really getting small now, down to a younger 5&#39;6&quot;, her breasts rapidly shrinking and her frame dwindling by the second as her development reversed. The younger croc looked over to her human and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I kind of like feeling small next to you.&quot; She grinned, teeth whitening and losing their sharp tip. Her voice was lighter, younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to play with you at different sizes, I guess.&quot; Todd shrugged, smiling warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess so.&quot; The croc smiled, draping of her legs over Todd&#39;s lap and pulling close as they cuddled as she shrank. At 18, the croc was 5&#39;4&quot; and looking far more adorable. Todd snuggled her close and turned her, draping her over his lap and cuddling her around the waist. Her tried not to touch her boobs, but they were still considerably big and soft. He experimented as she fell to 16 and 5&#39;2&quot;, and began toying with her pert young breasts. The crocodile liked it, leaning back and putting her hand over Todd&#39;s head as he got her nipples nice and hard. It was a pity she was shrinking down, he would have to do this when she was adult sized.<br />
<br />
At 15, Gretta was losing her curves. Her young waist was thickening as she compacted in proportion and her thighs were deflating with her breasts. She was getting small and lean, no more than five feet in height, and pretty soon her chest was down to two large oranges as Todd watched and felt her shrink in his lap. She was young now, more innocent, her snout had shrunken back and her body was almost adrogynous save for her small boobs and very light feminine shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so tiny!&quot; Gretta stared at herself in wonder, comparing the size of her hand to Todd. &quot;You&#39;re gonna take care of me, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, love.&quot; Todd blushed, leaning in protectivley and cuddling the crocodile closer. Any pretext of sexuality began to fade for both as Gretta reduced to 12 or so and became much more of a little girl, barely into puberty. She was still so cute, but Todd found it hard to sexualize her anymore. Especially as she lost her curves and almost all of her bust as she fell to ten and 4&#39;4&quot;.<br />
<br />
He cradled the much smaller crocodile now, petting the top of her head as her good eye lidded and she let out a higher pitched growl. Smaller. Smaller. Smaller. Gretta crept younger and younger, losing all hints of her feminimity as she  reduced to a young girl of ten and kept going, slim, without definition, her sexuality non-existant. She simply relaxed and shrank.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Oh, Todd.&quot; The croc suddenly opened her eye and sat up. &quot;I feel really weird now. It&#39;s... getting stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Todd gulped, putting his hand on the croc girl&#39;s back as she became a tiny eight year old.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Nuh-uh!&quot; Gretta shook her head, looking down at herself in alarm as she shrank and shrank, shedding age and size like crazy. &quot;Feels... kinda... buzzy?&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
Todd carefully picked her up and wrapped her around his neck and front. She hung on as he carried her to the table and sat her incredibly innocent self down. The croc sat, unconciously swinging her legs, as she reduced to three feet tall and at most six years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.&quot; Gretta put her hands on the table and swayed her tail. &quot;I&#39;m getting little!&quot; She giggled girlishly and looked up at Todd with a bright happy smile. &quot;This is so weird, Todd! Doncha think?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd watched carefully as Gretta continued her slide into early childhood and nodded. &quot;It sure is, little lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; The crocodile laughed. &quot;I&#39;m not a lady anymore! I&#39;m a little kid! And I&#39;m cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd giggled as she grew more immature and fell to four. She was getting small, compact, and almost paunchy. Soon enough she was a toddler and Todd picked her back up, cradling the increasingly tiny 2&#39; 9&quot; crocodile in her arms carefully and hugging her close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Towd...&quot; Gretta yawned. &quot;I&#39;m gettin&#39; sleepy. I think it&#39;s nite-nite soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay, Gretta.&quot; Todd gently rubbed her head. She was fading fast now, just over two feet tall and a tiny 24 months old. &quot;You go ahead and sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danks, Towd.&quot; Gretta lisped slightly. &quot;I wuv yew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, Gretta.&quot; Todd smiled, cradling her dwindling form and rocking her gently as she lulled into a deep contented sleep. &quot;I love you too, baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crocodile dozed off with a smile and curled into Todd&#39;s chest as she shrank to a one year old. Then, she began to shrink rapidly. In moments she was only a foot tall from head to toe, soft, weak, compact, and still she shrank on and on, at eight inches tall she curled into a fetal position, her long tail wrapping up her front between her legs, and whatever hint of humanity she still had faded as she shrank to a tiny six inch crocodile. Todd watched in amazement as he carefully put Gretta in his hand while a soft gel layer began to form around her. At first this was utterly bizarre, but the gel grew around her still shrinking form and encased her, hardending into the shell of an egg. When she was entirely hidden away, Todd held her up to the light carefully and observed the dim shadow of a still shrinking fetal crocodile baby, reducing to its simplest form inside her egg.<br />
<br />
Amazed, Todd stood up with Gretta&#39;s tiny three inch long egg in his hand, carefully placing it on the table and picking up the remote. Everything fell quiet and still as the egg completed its regression fully. Todd scanned the remote and marvelled as it began to overwrite her DNA and fix incompabilities with the remote. Her memories showed they were safely locked away in her brain. Her personality and physical potential were intact, but Gretta was very much reduced to a simple amniotic embryo waiting to start growing again into a crocodile.<br />
<br />
Todd carefully picked up her egg, having ensured the process was complete, and looked around for something he could carry her in. He saw a soft well insulated lunch bag and carefully placed her within, padding the egg with a bunch of paper towel from the cleaning supplies and closing the lid. Placing the lunch bag down, Todd looked around and grabbed the heavy worn keys from the janitor&#39;s hook. He might need those.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the lunch bag, turned off the TV, and slipped out into the hallway. Now, to escape with his friend.</p>
