<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It takes some time for enough people to sign up, but before too long, you&#39;re back in the arena and ready to go again.<br />
Since you used the wait to get used to your new clothes and body, you don&#39;t need long to get going, and once again you&#39;re on a zapping spree, frequently catching people off guard.<br />
You do take a few hits every now and then, but aside from some tingling, you don&#39;t really notice anything different and figure they&#39;ve either been minor changes, or yet another redundant &quot;fox&quot; or &quot;female&quot; blast that won&#39;t change anything else about you.<br />
Either way, you&#39;re having lots of fun, and while your reflexes haven&#39;t improved since you first got turned into a fox, they&#39;re still much better than those of your average contestant, so after a while you decide to increase the challenge and deliberately hit people with animals that would have an obvious advantage at this kind of competition, obviously still anthropomorphic - &quot;Zap, you&#39;re a small mouse guy - Zap, you&#39;re part nimble rabbit - Zap, you now have literal eagle eyes, and the plumage to go with them - Zap, you&#39;re an anthro-chameleon, hope you get used to looking both ways at the same time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not all of the transformations last too long - the other shooters tag each other with all kinds of effects, from gender changes to other random animals - but you notice that you have to work a bit more to get a hit, especially without taking one in return as well.<br />
As for taking advantage of your curves, you don&#39;t even have to try that hard anymore, because between your massive assets and the fact that you&#39;re clad in attention-grabbing underwear, you catch several contestants blatantly staring at you, or even openly doubting whether you&#39;d actually be capable of getting anything done in your state - until you help them out with a pair of tits and butt cheeks of their own, that is - and for repeat offenders, grow their assets even bigger.<br />
<br />
Like last match, you eventually lose track of the time, and all too soon the round ends again, with you as the clear victor again. You&#39;re unsure whether you&#39;ve managed to beat your previous record, but judging from the congratulations you get from some of your fellow contestants, that seems to be the case - the rest of them are busy shooting the shit with each other, or being in awe of their new forms, but luckily, nobody held a grudge about your performance this time.<br />
You make for the the exit, but before you get there, one of the carnies waves you aside, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations on beating your own record! As you already know, you qualify for an extra prize, but more importantly, Dave wanted to see you again about ...your issue - he&#39;s in the Tech room, let me show you the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the other fairgoers that are still in earshot seem a bit confused about what they overheard, but the other staff members guide them to what you believe to be the room containing the de-transformation setup while you follow your new guide through another &quot;Employees only&quot; door.<br />
After a few turns and some walking, you&#39;re back at the door labeled &quot;Equipment and Tech&quot;, and find yourself back in the same messy working area you&#39;ve been before, this time accompanied by the unmotivated worker from before and a second guy who&#39;s busy fiddling with yet another different, oversized laser-gun.<br />
<br />
The former turns to you with his usual lack of enthusiasm and starts what seems to be a half-hearted version of a spiel he memorized a while ago: &quot;Congratulations on winning and setting a new record, you get a special prize, yadda, yadda, unfortunately it won&#39;t do shit for you unless we fix your situation, so let&#39;s give the floor to the nerd that spent the whole match pouring over your sensor data.&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;nerd&quot; in question keeps working on the gun, oblivious to his surroundings until his colleague gets his attention with an elbow to the ribs.<br />
&quot;Ow, what the heck, Dave, what was that for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eyes forward, Roy.&quot; Dave gestures in your direction, prompting the tinkerer to finally notice your presence.  <br />
Somewhat abashed, he clears his throat and starts talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you&#39;re the one that somehow managed to resist our morphogenic ray emitters, yes? A very interesting phenomenon, my thanks for allowing me to study the effects further - from what I can tell, the beams seem to properly make contact with you, but instead of causing the desired transmogrification to take place, you somehow manage to ignore them altogether, almost as if they dissipated just before entering you. Of course, this is an intended safety feature in cases where a single person gets exposed to excessive applications of the same change, like the ambush you&#39;ve experienced just prior, but-&quot;<br />
He pauses and makes a thoughtful expression, which you use to mention how you were still able to feel the hits, both during the match, and during the ambush, which seems to confuse him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that possible, we programmed the guns to project a field around their users in case they were about to get hit in these situations, that should cause the rays to harmlessly disperse just before making contact - say, how exactly did it feel to get hit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it tickled somewhat, and felt a bit warm, just like the direct hits, or like a gentle, warm breeze going through my fur.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes - say, do you still have the gun on you from the match? Excellent, please give it to me for a second, I&#39;ll take a look at its data.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy unlocks a hidden panel on the gun, revealing extra buttons and starts searching through the menus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, yes - no activations of the emergency feature logged, makes sense, they wouldn&#39;t hand out the same gun again, that one needs to get recharged anyway. Nothing else unusual either, let&#39;s look into the settings next - standard settings for barrier activation, set at a distance of -&quot; he looks up at you again, &quot;May I touch you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback, you move away from him while Dave bursts out laughing, &quot;Hey pal, you might want to rephrase that.&quot;<br />
<br />
It takes a few seconds for the tech to connect the dots, but you can make out the exact moment he does, as his face turns red with shame, &quot;No, no, miss, I didn&#39;t mean any offense, I, uh, wanted to inspect your fur- uh, well, its length to be precise, as there is a chance the default settings of the protective bubble were insufficient to cover all of you, resulting in, well, unexpected results, and-&quot;  <br />
<br />
He goes on for a while about technical details that go way over your head before you manage to calm him down again, and hold out your arm for him to look at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you miss, now let&#39;s see - should still be fine here, but there might be more issues in other areas. Say, may I inspect your tail as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn around and move your newest appendage towards him, trying not to flinch in spite of him brushing your fur aside and grabbing the limb in question once you do. After that, he starts inspecting the fur all over your body, thankfully skipping any areas you&#39;d consider improper, but you still feel a like you just had checkup from your doctor after he&#39;s done.<br />
At some point during all of this, he sent Dave to go get a second standard gun, and once he&#39;s back and the checkup is over, the nerd hands you five more sensor bands - one for each wrist, ankle, and your tail, respectively - and begins making place on the worktable to add his laptop to the chaos.<br />
<br />
Once you&#39;re ready, he hands you back the gun, which now sports some extra sensors as well, and takes the one Dave fetched while explaining, &quot;Alright, I&#39;m rather certain that the default settings of the protective field were too strict to cover all of you, since it is set to only dissipate incoming rays once they&#39;re within half of an inch of your skin, and your fur is considerably longer in many places. This shouldn&#39;t have any significant effects, but it might&#39;ve been what caused further transformations to fail.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then aims his gun at you and states, &quot;First test, basic species transformation, vulpine to feline. Expected result: Success.&quot;<br />
He fires, and as usual, you feel a bit of a tingling, but nothing else happens.  <br />
Immediately, he looks at the readouts on his computer, and frowns, &quot;Sensor readings inconclusive - shot was detected, but no changes happened - next test: Redundant changes, excessive femininity. Expected result: Barrier activation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tests continue for some time, with a variety of settings, and both with and without a visualization of the barrier, as well as with different distance settings, and even with the patchwork of a gun that Dave tried to administer the &quot;special prize&quot; before, all with the same result - nothing.<br />
However, he seems to be unable to find what he was looking for, and at some point, Dave interrupts him: &quot;Hey Dude, you should have more than enough data to crunch by now, I don&#39;t think going through every single combination of settings is going to change anything, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sigh, Roy relents you step away from each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sadly, I&#39;ve been unable to figure out what the exact reason for your situation, but I have a few theories. I&#39;m also working on a way to solve your wardrobe issues, in case your affliction takes longer to reverse, but for now, please stay nearby, or at least give us a way to contact you and we will once we know more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave butts in, &quot;You know, you&#39;ve won another free shot at beating your own record again, so you won&#39;t even have to think to hard about what to pass the time with - and I think, some of my colleagues came up with something that might catch your interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you do, please continue to wear my sensors so we get all the possible information - oh, and use this gun too!&quot;<br />
Roy takes your gun, changes a few settings on it and hands it back to you, leaving the extra sensor in place.</p>
