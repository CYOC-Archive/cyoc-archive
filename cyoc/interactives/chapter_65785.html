<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunny got up from her seat on the floor, suddenly remembering that she had to go pick up her little sister <br />
Moon from summer camp since her parents were at work. Heading into her room to grab her car keys, purse, and <br />
shoes, she just as quickly came back out and told Rain that she'd be right back and would call her on the <br />
road. Giving Rain a hug and peck on the cheek goodbye, her skirt fluttered in the rush to exit the door. <br />
<br />
Was this of Rain's doing, or just new memories setting in?<br />
<br />
Soon enough, about ten minutes later, Daniele and Misty walked out of the bathroom dressed in some casual <br />
cloths(T-shirts and skorts), asking Rain if she'd like to go to the mall with them. Rain declined, saying that <br />
she was just starting to feel a little sick from the booze last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo, not so tough now, are you Rain? You're not immune to hangover's after all,&quot; teased Misty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny&quot; said Daniele. &quot;It's OK, Rain. We can do something later. Like go to that party at P.B's place, or <br />
we can drive out to the boonies or whatever. See ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
And the two twins also wiggled out the door, hand in hand.<br />
<br />
Rain was left all alone with Vicki, formerly Chris Smith, who was nursing a headache in her bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Vicki&quot; shouted Rain from across the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; said the redhead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there someone you know that you really, really hate? I have a good way to get revenge on them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate tons of people, Rain, but there's no one I would call my arch-enemy or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicki left her room, now dressed more fully compared to earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, what kind of evvvvvil plot do you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This, honey&quot; said Rain, emphasizing with her laptop for Vicki to sit down with her.<br />
<br />
Vicki looked and saw a 3D rotating outline of a generic human male.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is called the Chronivac 4.0. It morphs people into anything you can imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck, you're one of those furry nuts, aren't you?&quot; she asked, sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...not really. I like experimenting, trying out different things. Furry culture definitely isn't one of <br />
them. The cool thing about this though is that you can adjust the perspective of anyone, and make them think <br />
that they were always the way you transformed into being. Oh, don't give me that look! It only lasts 24 hours, <br />
see look.&quot; Rain opened another tab to show Vicki the instructions. Then she explained what she wanted to <br />
transform the chosen person into.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe this is real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's real, Vicki. I could use it on myself, but I thought it would be fun to try it on someone you hated.&quot; <br />
Rain smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, Rain. I-...wait, I know EXACTLY who you can fuck with. Hold on...&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicki took out her cell phone and called up her boyfriend from high school. &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Alex. Want to come over to my place? Yes, we can do that. No, I don't care what you did, all is forgiven. <br />
Yeah, I hit you over the head with a marble ashtray. I'm a bitch when I'm upset, didn't you already know that? <br />
At least I'm not some Lifetime crybaby. OK, I'm sorry too. Love you too. C'mon over!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did he do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a long story&quot; replied Vicki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you believe me then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, but I trust you enough to believe you're not some psycho. So even if you are wrong, which you <br />
probably are, I don't think there's a good enough reason to be worried. And hell, I'll embarrass the weenie <br />
myself if I have to.&quot; Vicki smiled devilishly.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Alex was riding in his new convertible to see Vicki. Gosh, how long since he last saw her? They were <br />
fifteen...eh, no more than three or four years. But he had moved on from that point in his life. Why did she <br />
call him out of the blue all of a sudden? Oh, yeah. Forget. Crazy. Vicki was hot and smart, but as she herself <br />
admitted, a total basket case bitch if the mood wasn't right. Alex suspected that she might be bi-polar...or <br />
possibly She-Hulk. If he had known sooner, he might have gone out with Daniele or Misty instead.<br />
<br />
Making his way to the right floor, and finding the right number, Alex then knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey baby!&quot; said Vicki as she opened the door. &quot;Say hi to Rain, my roommate. She's a gothic chick, but really <br />
cool and funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi&quot; waved Rain.<br />
<br />
Alex did a spit take. &quot;Hey, you know Sandman, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The comic book?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, or the graphic novel collection. You look just like Death, Dream's sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; said Rain, genuinely surprised and touched.<br />
<br />
Sean had read a decent number of comics before, mostly in the manga section though. But one of the Western <br />
comics that he really liked was Sandman. Death was indeed very attractive in a cute way, and if he says so <br />
himself, he could see the resemblance between Rain and the character.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Vicki told you about the three-way, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. I love three-ways. They're so...not monogamous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head smirking to himself. Rain thought his hair was cute as it fell back and forth so <br />
thoroughly. She didn't want to make this change indefinite.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, so I'll take you in the room for a few minutes to get you warmed up&quot; said Vicki, now grabbing her on <br />
again boyfriend by the wrist to her bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oww, that hurts&quot; said Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I'll be able to kiss it and make it feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicki gave a &quot;I've got this&quot; grin at Rain just before she shut the door and locked it. She was undressing Alex <br />
and using some foreplay to stall for time.<br />
<br />
Rain went to her computer, and found Alex's profile already there. Activating it to be transform ready, she <br />
thought about how &quot;Jayne&quot; should look.<br />
<br />
Jayne's most prominent feature would be her toothy grin. Her chompers would big, really big, but not <br />
freakishly so. In fact, Rain thought that it would make her look very friendly and outgoing. Next, he wanted <br />
to do a race lift. Maybe make her of some sort of Native American stock. Tall, dark, and curvy, as it were. <br />
Looking through the massive list of Native American racial transformation options available, Rain just decided <br />
to randomly click on the one that she had a gut feeling on and chose &quot;Algonquin&quot;. Her height would be 5'11, <br />
her hair would reach her elbows, and her eyes would be a darkish brown color.<br />
<br />
As for mental transformations, Rain made it a priority to list her as bisexual. Rain's body was still <br />
technically inhabited by Sean, a guy as turned on by hot girls as anybody, and for the last few days he's been <br />
SURROUNDED by them with nowhere to get his rocks off because everyone here was strictly heterosexual. So yeah, <br />
Jayne would be bisexual, with a bit of a crush on Rain, and she would be funny and sarcastic to everyone <br />
around her. As has been said before, Sean/Rain had no interest in bimbos, and as long as he was doing these <br />
changes to people, he wanted them to all be reasonably smart, at least able to hold up a conversation. Heck, <br />
Sunny was the token blonde ditzy girl, and she's been the most observant one of everyone in the group about <br />
Rain's changes!<br />
<br />
So far, Rain had been making these changes permanent, which meant that they couldn't be reverted back into <br />
their original forms until Rain manually undid the changes. Alex/Jayne would be different. Rain set the <br />
changes to last for twenty-four hours, and then she would revert back into Alex. Awareness would be shut off <br />
in both cases, which meant that he wouldn't remember being Alex as Jayne or recall being Jayne when he went <br />
back to being Alex. Rain had briefly considered the intriguing idea that Alex could be triggered into turning <br />
into Jayne whenever he visited this apartment, but she couldn't find an app for this idea. &quot;Oh well&quot;, she <br />
thought. &quot;I guess I'll just have to wait for the Chronivac 5 for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Vicki and Alex were in the bedroom moaning and ruining the box-spring, Rain began to ponder a little <br />
about why his small interest in being female had resulted in five other male-to-female transformations over <br />
the last two days. She didn't want to admit it, but Rain knew that he was getting addicted to this. <br />
<br />
&quot;At this rate, I'm practically making my own sorority house here&quot; she whispered. She was then briefly reminded <br />
of the Spells R Us story &quot;A Strangeness At The Sorority House&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, all the changes are ready&quot; she said out loud to herself. She then pressed the left hand button to click <br />
&quot;Confirm changes&quot;. <br />
<br />
Alex started to change in front of Vicki...</p>
