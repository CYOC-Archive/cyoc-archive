<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not long after Alex went to his room, Princess and Francine went to the kitchen to grab water. The older woman still had trouble grasping objects and drinking water as a human. Seeing her mother&#39;s state made Princess despair, she felt this was all her fault. Had she not gone to the Zoo on that day, she would never had the opportunity to make this mistake again. She hugged her mother and apologized while crying. Francine on the other hand was very comforting, it was clear to the daughter her mother was not as distressed as she, or anyone else was. She asked her about it and the only thing she said was &quot;I enjoyed my time as a pony, but I guess I would prefer to be a horse…&quot;. Princess was shocked, but Francine played it for laughs. <br />
The truth was she was not joking, a big part of her enjoyed her time as a simple animal, breeding her mare. But she knew well some important part of her was lost, and didn&#39;t want to loose it again, she wished she could be like the dog for a while, human and animal at the same time.<br />
Before her daughter could say anything, Alice came in to warn her that Jessica was on her front yard looking for her. Princess left in a hurry.<br />
Before she could leave, Francine called over to her. She wanted to apologize for what had happened before. Anxious to not talk about this subject, Alice grabbed the first cup she could find and filled it with water. That cup was the same Princess had used a few seconds prior.<br />
&quot;Look, I know what happened okay. I turned too, I know you can&#39;t resist it. I just need some time to process the feelings&quot;. The mother gave an understanding not. Alice thanked her and started to walk away when she felt a strong heat come over her. She could feel her borrowed panties get drenched in her juices before she even managed to sit down on the floor. She called to her mom, terrified she would be stuck as a goat again for the rest of her life, but Francine&#39;s reaction made her worried something else might be in store for her. The woman had lifted her dress and started stroking her own member, entranced by the familiar smell of a mare in heat.<br />
Alice, upon seeing her equine dick felt an orgasm wash over her and she moaned. The same happened to Francine as she released her seed over the kitchen again. This felt like a retread of her own kitchen incident from before, except this time Alice was not resisting. The former goat was now looking at herself finger a darkening pussy, and she knew there and then that she regretted having wished to be a horse, but this regret was short lived as another, stronger orgasms hit. <br />
The moans from both parties attracted the family&#39;s father, who saw his undressed wife jerking a black stallion cock, while her tail swished. He knew what he had to do. His look gave Alice some hope he would put a stop to this madness, event though a part of her didn&#39;t want him to. That hope was quickly shattered as he removed all of his clothes and presented himself to his stallion of a wife. Francine changed course from her daughter, to her husband. Thomas started to beg Francine to make him a mare again, he didn&#39;t want to be a man anymore. Not that he needed to beg, but his passion moved her to fuck him(?) even harder hastening both of their changes. Both started developing more muscles at the same time howls started to be heard from upstairs. Francine&#39;s breasts did not retreat this time, they enlarged to along with her now wife. The display made Alice&#39;s resistance even harder, and the few clothes she was still using were getting tighter. She noticed her father&#39;s figure become more and more feminine, while her mother&#39;s was kept mostly the same. She watched with a mix of horror and desire as their faces elongated into muzzles and their hair became a mixed with the mane, her former father&#39;s growing to match Francine&#39;s. Fur covered most of their bodies when both parties neighed with a powerful orgasm. They were both still there, Francine and Thomas, whether he would keep the name or not. Francine looked over her new body and felt a weight lift of her shoulder, this was perfect. She was both human and horse, woman and stallion. She looked over at her daughter, and she saw she was now presenting herself to her mother, wishing to be made whole. Francine complied, sinking her dark member in her equally dark vagina. Alice was now both her daughter and mate, and the duality didn&#39;t bother her at all, Francine was duality incarnate. But she was not the only one.</p>
