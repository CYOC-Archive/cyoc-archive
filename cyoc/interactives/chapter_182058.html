<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at the pen with an air of respect and fear at what it was capable of Dave knew that even though it was mightily fun what he was able to do with it the pen was also very dangerous and he should tread very lightly. The instance with the hair taught him that perhaps he shouldn’t rewrite his own life at the moment and instead focus on remaking the rest of the world and his fellow workers more agreeable to him first baring the management of his workplace of course and not going about risking his job. This mindset is why even though he was bitterly angry at Joe for scheduling the company meeting during the lunch break he didn’t want to risk changing something about Joe that could adversely effect his job or even his own existence in the company. Still earlier Pete did stall Joe and give Dave some extra time and he was looking forward to rewarding Pete and his friendship through lunch and now that option was moot.<br />
<br />
After settling back into his chair Dave suddenly shot his head upwards from its downtrodden position as a new idea came into his head. “I still can have lunch with Dave and it won’t effect the management staff in anyway at least not outwardly” Dave said to himself as he looked back at the pen on his desk and the blank piece of paper sitting beside it. What Dave was thinking was quite bizarre and maybe a bit cruel to his friend but Dave kept his promises even if it meant swapping people around in the process. Picking up the pen in his writing hand Dave gave it one last inspection as his mind raced to the next steps he had to perform. Striking the pen to the paper Dave quickly wrote: “Pete Simpson will swap bodies with my secretary Jodie Taylor. Jodie in Pete’s body will take on his memories, behavior and personality and she will think nothing is amiss as she will think she has always been Pete, Pete in Jodie’s body will retain all of his former male memories and personality traits and will still believe that he is Pete even though he will also be aware that he is no longer in his male body. At the same time Pete in Jodie’s body will have all the skills and education necessary to perform the duties of a secretary.” Lifting the pen from the paper Dave was impressed with himself in his ability to write such clear and concise instructions just at the drop of a hat as he saw with the passing of several seconds the writing on the paper begin to glow and he heard a loud squeak come from the direction of the outside of his office.<br />
<br />
Cursing himself for not setting himself up in a better position ahead of time to watch the reaction Dave quickly got up from his desk and walked over to his door which he promptly opened a crack. Jodie Taylor was a HAPA as her father had been a American of European-descent and her mother Thai and Jodie had gotten the best of both worlds when it came to the mixing of those genes. A beautiful and kissable face, long black hair, large bust and butt measurements, and a short height at five and a half feet that made her an envy to many women around the office. Being fresh out of high school at 19 years old with a slew of typing and organization certificates to her name also made her a very competent worker and Dave could imagine that Mike was at a loss to lose her when he transferred out. Looking out the door Dave was both amused and concerned at what he saw. Jodie who had been nothing but tasteful in a fashion sense having decided today to wear a collared and long-sleeved white blouse with several of the buttons left undone near the top, a tight slightly above-the-knee length black pencil skirt and black high heels was sitting in her chair at her desk feeling over her face and body with her hands. Jodie’s eyes and head whipped around in a rapid fashion up and down and to the sides as her pony-tailed hair slapped the sides of her head. A serious and fearful look had appeared on her face before Dave had opened the door and the look didn’t look like it was going to go away anytime soon. Thankfully Jodie had her own little room in the glass office space before Dave’s office and the blinds had been lowered beforehand so at least she wasn’t causing a scene. The blinds being down came to be another godsend as Jodie soon halted her feel-up and fearful rapid scanning as the first signs of a cry began to overtake her.<br />
<br />
As the first gasps escaped her mouth and tears started to stream down her cheeks Jodie Taylor began to sob in earnest as she buried her face in her hands and leaned into them as her elbows lay in support on the desk. Dave was starting to lose himself too seeing his secretary in such an awful state. Closing the door behind himself softly Dave leaned up against the wall with his back and stared at the ceiling for several minutes. Dave never wanted to cause Pete his friend such distress and he didn’t think he would take such a change so emotionally. All he wanted to do was have a full lunch with his friend and he couldn’t do it with Pete in his original body with only thirty minutes to eat. As his secretary Pete could go with Dave to an early lunch before the meeting and that problem would be solved. Dave intended to tell Pete about the pen and the change during lunch but now he wasn’t too sure that was such a good idea seeing how Pete now finding himself as Jodie reacted. Walking back to his desk Dave wrote down on the notepad with the magic pen “No one will bother me or Jodie for the next hour.” Now that a possible commotion was averted Dave crept back to his office door and placed his ear to the frame. Several low sniffles were heard but nothing like the waterworks from earlier and Dave knew that this was the right time to ask her.<br />
<br />
Opening the door and stepping out of the office quickly Dave put on a concerned look on his face as he looked to Jodie at her desk. Seeing him emerge out of his office Jodie’s face for a split second brightened into a smile before her eyes looked away and she covered her mouth with her hands. “Jodie are you crying is something wrong?” Dave asked her with a note of heavy concern in his voice as Jodie continued to avert her eyes but was forced to redirect them to Dave’s face when replying to him “No Dave…. Oh no dammit I mean Mr. Travers!” Jodie said but soon after swearing and correcting herself. Gasps and tears began following from her emotions once again as the full gravity of her situation and her new position made itself clear.<br />
<br />
Seeing this beautiful girl begin to sob once again Dave sprung into action kneeling down beside Jodie “hey come here” he purred as he wrapped his arms around her body and gave her an expressive hug. Dave could feel Jodie nuzzling her face into his shoulder as she cried and surprisingly after a short time she began to return the hug herself as she wrapped her arms around the only place left that she could Dave’s neck. After several minutes of passionate hugs Dave felt like it was a good enough time to let go of his embrace and look to the woman of his desire. Letting go Dave saw that Jodie’s makeup and mascara were running but even with a smudged and red face the tears were dissipating and she actually had a small but embarrassed smile on her lips as she stared into his eyes with her own. Jodie was adamant after some coaching that it was just some family dispute she was going through without giving details that caused her outburst and insisted that she was fine. Dave knew that it was a lie but still intended to have lunch with his friend even after everything that happened. When he offered to take her to an early lunch he was completely floored how quickly she answered immediately saying yes as soon as he finished. Fighting the urge to do an about-take at Pete’s willingness to effectively go on a lunch-date with his best-friend turned-boss Dave forced a smile to his lips as they ironed out the time 11:30AM and the place being the cafe across the street. Dave didn’t know what to expect would come out of that lunch or what he would say to a Pete-turned Jodie. As Dave got up and headed back to his office he looked back and was quite surprised to see the new Jodie beginning to type rapidly and with a concentrated form on her computer almost like she knew what she was doing. Seeing him looking at her Jodie stopped her typing, lifted her head upward, stared in his eyes with a smile and said “Thank you Mr. Travers for everything you’ve done for me” and Dave couldn’t help himself as he also smiled back to her and said “your very welcome Jodie and please call me Dave.”</p>
