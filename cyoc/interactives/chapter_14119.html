<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy sat on the edge of Steve's bed, staring dejectedly at the chaos of his room and wondering what the hell she was gonna do if they couldn't figure out this mess. She sighed and buried her face in her hands. Her large male hands that covered a lot more of the face than she was used to. Cracking open her eyes and peering through a gap between her fingers, she saw her sock-clad feet beneath her. Thick white male sport socks on feet too big for their own good, at least compared to what she usually had. She sighed again and resigned herself to having to get used to it, at least for now. And the first thing she had to get used to was taking care of that pressure in her bladder. Getting up, she made her way to the bathroom and, after a moment's indecision, flipped up the toilet seat. She'd have to learn how to do this someday if she was stuck like this. Unzipping her jeans, she pulled out her penis and watched it's impressive length hang down in front of her. &quot;Here goes...&quot; Picking it up towards the end, she pointed it towards the bowl and tried to release the pressure inside her. She was rewarded with a steady stream of yellow and a feeling of relief and release almost similar in some ways, albeit much weaker, to what she'd felt when she'd cum earlier. She couldn't help but let loose a sigh at the feeling. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Rick rolled over in bed, still feeling blissful from the sex he'd had earlier. He and Bob had gone at is several times, and he'd had no idea his older brother was such an expert at making a woman feel so great. Not that he really had any other experience was a woman to compare it with, but he'd had literally dozens of orgasms over the night. It was... incredible. Each one like an explosion inside him as Bob skilfully penetrated, bringing him to the point of ecstasy over and over. Not to mention all the other stuff they'd done... He smiled and ran his slender hands over the mounds that were his new breasts, once Cindy's pride and joy, now his. Their sensitivity had been a welcome surprise for him. He sighed in contentment and glanced at the now gigantic form of Bob. He grinned as he noticed that the sheets were tented and rolled over, preparing to give his brother - no, he mentally corrected himself, his boyfriend - a pleasant awakening.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Kelvin crept up the hallway. He passed a room and, from within, heard the sounds of two people having sex. Well, he thought to himself, there goes interrogating whoever's in Cindy's body tonight. He had his suspicions, but the thought of Rick doing what he now heard seemed unlikely to say the least. More likely that Rick had moved on. He found another door and cracked it open. Ah, here was Rick's room, and- “wha!..uh…!”. He did a double take as two attractive girls he recognised from his classes came into view. &quot;Hey, Ricky&quot; one of them said. &quot;You told us to climb here an hour ago if we wanted some more of you. You know, if we hadn't wanted some of this&quot; - she grabbed a stunned Kelvin's very aroused crotch - &quot;so much, we'd be gone by now&quot;. Kelvin grinned, then stripped off his pants. One of the women squealed as he flipped her onto the bed, reveling in the power he felt doing so, and began to explore the advantages of being one of the most sought-after men in town.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Steve stretched out on his bed and tried to get to sleep. He heard the door open quietly. “Are you okay?” inquired a female voice. His new mother, he guessed. “Uhhh… feeling a little sick” he called out. “Oh. Do you want me to bring up food?” Steve grinned. His aunt and uncle would’ve ordered him out of bed and gotten him to fix them dinner anyway. “No, I’m fine” The door closed and he lay there in the dark, stretched out to his long new body’s full extent, staring up at the ceiling. It was a few moments before curiosity got the better of him and he rose, still a little uncordinated on these limbs, and flicked on the light. He moved his gaze around the room, full of books and work. No CDs or anything, he bemoaned. Of all the kids to become, it had to be a nerd. Hunting around, he found a photo album, and slid it off the shelf and opened it. Shuffling though, he found images of his new form, smiling at the camera, flanked by a man and a woman, and a young kid. A family. He’d have to get used to that. Smiling ruefully to himself, he slid it back in just as the door burst open and a sudden blur flew into the room and slammed into him. “Heyyoucan’tbackoutyousaidyou’dplaywithmeI’msogonnabeatyoucomeonnow!”. Steve let himself be dragged out of the room by Kelvin’s younger brother, a twinge of guilt at lying to these people doing nothing to dampen the involuntary grin spreading across his face.<br />
<br />

<br />
Cindy finished mopping up the piss scattered around the toilet and straightened up. This was clearly going to take some practice. Slumping against the wall, she ran her hands through her hair in frustration before jerking them out as she realised what she’d been doing with them today. “Ewwww!” So far today she'd gotten a crapload of mud, Steve's urine and Rick's semen all over them; definetly time for a bath. 'Yeah, sure. That’s gonna be to get clean. Riiiight.' mocked a lonely and ignored voice inside her head. She leant over and peeled off Steve’s thick socks, exclaiming in disgust as she caught a whiff of the sweaty foot smell. She grimaced and threw them over to the far corner of the bathroom, then wiggled out of her shirt and chucked it to join them. After pulling off her jeans, she turned on the taps and stood there shivering in her boxers as the bath filled. A quick glance in the mirror revealed her to be the perfect image of a discheveled teen boy, and she quickly moved her gaze away before finding it once again attracted to the mirror, against her best efforts. The whole deal was just too much to comprehend. After the bath had filled, she pulled off the boxers and stood there for a moment, feeling the weirdness of her genetalia swinging beneath her before she clambered into the tub. The heat of the water enveloped her and she closed her eyes tried to relax, but along with the envelopment came a heightened sense of her body’s layout, with the water washing over her flat chest, massaging her muscles, waving around her… she opened her eyes again. “Don’t you ever give up?” she rhertoically asked her new appendage as it stood proudly above the water.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Kelvin stretched out in bed. He looked from side to side and found the two beauties had left. Well, if this was the kind of life Rick had been leading, he had no problems with that. The three of them had exhausted each other, and it had been a revelation for him. The power he’d felt, slamming his thick manhood in and out of them, causing them to scream in pleasure… it had been incredible. And the stamina of this body! He’d felt like a god, being able to keep going after anyone else would have collapsed from exhaustion.<br />
<br />
He rolled out of bed, pulling on boxer shorts and headed to the bathroom, turning on a shower and getting in. He lathered up his body, massaging his muscles, feeling himself up as he had back at his place the previous nigh- “Yeaa!” he yelped as he turned around and saw he wasn’t alone in the bathroom. Standing outside the steamy glass was a an attractive young blonde woman, arms crossed, undressed. He covered himself with his hands and stood there dumbly as she slipped into the shower and smiled at him. “Hello, Kelvin” she said. “Rick?” Kelvin squeaked. Rick nodded. “You don’t need to cover yourself. It’s nothing I’ve never seen before.” His hands slipped down and pulled Kelvin’s off his crotch and stroked his old body’s member, smiling up at Kevlin all the while. “What do you want?” gasped Kelvin, shocked. It was hard to equate the asshole Rick with this… seductress. Of course, he supposed it would be hard to equate the old him with the stud he’d been last night. But this! Rick slid his hands over his old body and whispered in Kelvin’s ear “All I want is for you to not fuck this up for me, alright? If you do, I can put you in a body you’ll regret for a very short life. If you let things go my way, you can stay like this. And I can make things even more… pleasurable for both of us.” Kelvin jumped back as Rick licked his ear, then stepped out of the stall, dried himself and dressed while Kelvin stood there, frozen. “Oh, by the way, big guy.” he said as she walked out the door. “School starts in half an hour. Better get ready!” And with that he departed, leaving Kelvin standing there stunned, confused, and so hard it hurt.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Rick walked down the hall with a bounce in his step, enjoying the feeling of his breasts bobbing in front of him, and fingering the ring he’d attached to a chain around his neck. He felt confident that the geek wouldn’t give him away, especially not after the e-mails he’d sent to Gina and Robyn yesterday. He’d heard the two of them at it with his body last night, and he knew they would have given Kelvin a night he wouldn’t forget. As a matter of fact, he mused to himself, he might as well try and hook up with them now he was in this body. They’d sure as hell be willing, and he was curious what it’s be like to try women as a woman himself. But first… he smiled as he considered the possibilities of what he could do with the ring. Revenge he could take.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Cindy groaned as she heard an alarm clock’s beeping go off. She flailed her arm out to where it should have been, but found herself waving at empty space. She rolled over and crashed to the floor, sensations from a fit young male body instead of her expected self adding to her confusion. Then it all came flooding back. She’d ended up in a sixteen-year-old guy’s body. She had to get up for school. She’d sleeping in his bed, in nothing but boxer shorts. And a ruler sized erection was sticking out the bottom of them. She had morning wood. She had morning… “Fuck! This is NOT how I was planning to spend today” she muttered to herself as she pulled herself up.<br />
