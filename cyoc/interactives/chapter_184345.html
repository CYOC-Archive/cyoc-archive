<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You shudder and let out an embarrassing moan from the spank, as it felt unreal. So much pleasure came from just a single spank. But that wasn&#39;t all. You wanted him to do it to you more, just above the base of your tail this time. You looked up at your Master yet again, but this time, instead of wearing a look of terror on your face. A look of lustful hopelessness was in it&#39;s place. <br />
<br />
Your Master ignored it though, and simply crouched down next to you. &quot;Come on now, stand up on your feet Samantha.&quot; You felt your body move on it&#39;s own,  raising your lower torso up off of the floor. You felt once again your huge breasts flop down together underneath you, heavily swinging slightly from the motion. <br />
<br />
With a smile, your Master snapped his fingers. The next moment, your nipples stopped vibrating and then each one felt a pinch, then a weight hanging down from them. You looked to investigate, only to find a thin silver chain now linked them together with help from a pair of nipple rings. Another snap sounded and your head and neck straightened, forcing you to look only in a generally forwards direction. You could see more or less unobstructed when looking directly in front of you, but the modified posture collar made seeing anything behind, underneath, on top of, and to the back sides of you impossible. <br />
<br />
Your Master then fed another part of the silver chain up and through a other ring hanging down from your collar, and clipped the leash to the smaller ring at the end. He stood back up and gave a testing tug on the leash. You felt your nipples being tugged on and stepped forwards out of panic. The slack returns to the chain and your nipples are no longer being tugged on by their piercings. You let out a quiet sigh of relief when the tugging happens again. <br />
<br />
You can&#39;t go forwards anymore so you do the only thing could think of and sit up on your legs in a squatting pose, with your hands on the floor, mimicking a sitting dog posture. You look pleadingly towards your Master, silently begging him to stop pulling so hard. He just chuckles and pets your head, which you admittedly really enjoyed, but were not happy about it. But that is all he did and simply opened the door and began moving forwards through the threshold.<br />
<br />
You quickly prepare yourself and push yourself through the pain and pleasure to walk through it. Your pussy feels so good, but your nipples keep mildly being pulled which made them start to ache for a few seconds after each tug. <br />
<br />
Worst of all though, is that you were somehow actually starting to enjoy the tugging. You also noticed that at a certain distance, the vibrator&#39;s intensity dimmed to almost nothing, allowing you to focus more on keeping pace with your Master. <br />
<br />
You followed obediently, while keeping up the perfect pace to the best you could manage. Walking on all fours was getting easy for you too, likely thanks to something your Master subtly did to you. Without you realizing it, your arms and legs were now roughly the same length, and your hips and shoulders were slightly altered to better suit a quadropeddle stance as well. But you were oblivious to any of this of course. <br />
<br />
&quot;This here Samantha is the dining hall. Your food and water bowls are going to be served here as well. I hope you quickly adapt to eating and drinking from them, as this will be how all your meals and drinks are served to you. Eating at the table is only upon receiving my direct permission. And as you are both a maid and a pet. Eating together is unlikely. You will either eat after I have, or when I tell you too. And one crucial thing. You are forbidden from ever use your hands or any utensils to eat. That means you now eat with just your mouth, incase you hadn&#39;t figured that out, Samantha. And yes, that is even when you are allowed to sit at the table with me. Understand?&quot; Instructed your Master. You simply could just nod in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s continue with our tour. To the next room.&quot; And this is how you spent the next 4 hours. Being lead around like a dog while on a tour of the mansion. You haven&#39;t even worried about the fact that you are fully naked either, having gotten use to it after the first hour. When any of the other maids or keepers would see you, you would just smile at them politely. Not because you were super happy, but because you didn&#39;t want to make Master mad at you by being rude. <br />
<br />
At least he had removed the last vibrator over an hour ago, once you proved that you learned how to behave obediently and walk along with him properly. You also had your tail curled up, which was not your doing. Your master made it do it all on it&#39;s own, just so that your ass and pussy would be on full display for anyone to look at. It was humiliating at first, but you also have gotten somewhat use to it. You do wish he would just leave your tail alone though as it was not really all that comfortable having it be stuck all curled up like that. You are not like one of those dogs after all.<br />
<br />
You also suspect that your Master must be doing things secretly to you, because you know that you are way to calm and accepting for the current situation. You should be freaking out more, or struggling, or just simply anything, and yet all you are doing is accompanying your Master on a walk throughout the mansion. What&#39;s more, you are beginning to be genuinely curious about, and want to continue exploring this place further. Not to mention how many times you have caught yourself making mental notes of the various small places in which you would need to remember to clean and dust later.</p>
