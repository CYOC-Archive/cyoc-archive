<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait....you guys LIVE HERE&quot; Shouted Sofia in amazement as she entered into the new space as fast as she could manage, Alice giggled at her daughters display of awe and curiosity, she was like a kid in a candy shop, eager to see and examine everything at once.<br />
<br />
The rooms at the top of the hospital had been designed to be a stress free, easy access environment, designed with Alice and her teams needs in mind, the elevator opened up into a large white walled room, with a large glass wall to the right of the elevator with a white rectangular pillar in the middle, with a black modern fireplace buried into the wall, with grey slate around its trim forming a shelf above the fireplace.<br />
<br />
Infront of the fireplace was a large cream coloured rug, with a white marble coffee table, with a grey three seater sofa facing the window, allowing the group to gaze upon the lights of the city, the center of the room took one step down in a square shape, with a TV stand and 32inch flat screen resting atop it&#39;s glass surface, and a two seater brown loveseat that had a wicker side table with a arms length pole of LED lights as a lamp, and two small wicker seats with colourfully patterned pillows and blanket covers over their surface.<br />
<br />
On the right side of the room along the step down was a frosted glass room divider, with a slate base and wooden beams either end, as for what lay beyond it, Sofia was unsure, but judging by the black marble kitchen island that poked out she guessed that was the kitchen, Sofia was in awe as she stepped into the room, taking in its serenity and calm atmosphere, yet it had a welcoming atmosphere to it, almost like returning home.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hospital board thought that it would be easier for all of us to live on the hospital grounds, being as a certain someone needs pills that are, should we say considered contraband outside theis walls&quot; came a voice that Sofia hadn&#39;t heard before, and as Sofia gazed at the frosted glass a faint shape of a person could be seen moving around on the other side, but whoever this was didn&#39;t seem to be a stranger or trespassing here as Alice and Max wheeled into the large living room, with Lina hot on their heels.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey love, I thought that you were still working the front desk&quot; called Max to the figure, &quot;No, Marcus said he would cover for me so I could be with you guys, by the way did I over hear something about a-&quot; the voice was cut short as they stepped around the corner, this woman was gorgeous, Sofia guessed that if she wanted she could easily be a super model, her face was smooth with rosey cheeks, high cheek bones, full lips and ice blue eyes, her hair was charcoal blackand was straight and uniform,  being cut to just below her sholders, she wore a black belly top that had thin sholder straps and a rectangular cutout at the bottom, exposing the underside of her breasts, and a bar of joggers that were orange at the top but faded into purple as it aproched the bottom, but what confused Sofia was the fact that this woman was waring two pink oven mits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, Alice, who&#39;s your friend?, if I&#39;d known we had company I would have made myself more presentable&quot; the woman giggled nervously, Alice with Max&#39;s help heaved herself from the wheelchair and heavily waddled over to Sofia, with Max following close behind, his hands of Alice&#39;s hips to give her support as Alice wrapped her arm around Sofias sholders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welll, Linda, baby, meet my daughter Sofia&quot; said Alice with pride as she gently nudged her forward, Sofia was nervous of meeting this person, almost like how she was nervous to meet her mother, but why did she feel this way around this Linda person?, Sofias hand fluttered to her belly, her thumb stroking its surface as Linda stared wide eyed at her, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I had the same reaction as you, and yes she is her biological daughter&quot; said Max as he gave Sofia a reasuring smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...the- but you- oh my god Alice why didn&#39;t you tell us?, she looks to be almost 18!&quot; Said Linda as she rushed over and placed her oven mit hands either side of Alice&#39;s face &quot;mmmmmm,mmmm mm mmmmm&quot; came Alice&#39;s muffled reply as her cheeks had been squished by Linda, Sofia gave a small chuckle as Linas chuckles joined her from one of the wicker chairs, when Linda realised that she was preventing Alice from speaking she let go with a blush, holding her hands behind her back &quot;I didn&#39;t tell you because when I had her, I was druged when they took her away&quot; said Alice in a sad voice, she had Sofias attention then, her parents had told her that her mother had left her when she was born, but now her mother stood before her and told everyone that she was DRUGED,  and that She had not been given up but TAKEN, did that mean that everyone knew what she could do even back then?, as she dwelled on theis thoughts everyone else was deep in conversation.<br />
<br />
Everyone stopped however when Sofia let out a groan as her belly lurched forward, everyone now frozen in place, all eyes now fixed on Sofia, Alice looked at her daughter with concern, what had just happened? &quot;Nononono hermano, I need you to stay as yo- Nnnnnghh&quot; groaned Sofia as she clutched her suddenly growing belly, almost like she was trying to hold it back &quot;please hermanito, I promised mama and papa, please just stay small&quot; she said as tears ran down her face as she looked up at Alice, Max and Linda, Alice, as quickly as she could waddled over to her daughters aid, holding out her hands as Sofia eagerly took hold, sqeezing as her face became red with effort to stop whatever was happening &quot;its ok baby, its ok, just let go, iv got you now&quot; cooed Alice as she lifted Alice&#39;s chin to look at her, she she looked into Sofias eyes she only saw fear and sadness, but that was quickly washed away as her belly lurched once again causing her to lean forward from the movement and the sudden change in weight &quot;why did you have to make things more difficult NOW pequeño?&quot; Groaned Sofia, her belly now looking three months overdue, Max and Linda then rushed over to assist Alice as they each wrapped one of Sofias arms over both of their sholders and helped heave her into a upright position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I guess, this is as good a time as any to give you all some answers&quot; chuckled Sofia nervously, Alice simply put her hand on her daughters cheek &quot;oh honey, start from the beginning.....&quot;</p>
