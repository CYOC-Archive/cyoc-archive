<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve closed his eyes as he leaned back in his seat.  The AC kicked on and a cold blast of air momentarily washed over his skin before the cold seemed to dissipate.  Still, as the gust of air blew past his face, he could swear that he smelled… skunk?<br />
<br />
It was faint at first, but less than a second later the stench became overpowering, and Steve began to gag.  That, in turn, caused Steve’s butt to press into the seatback, only for it to feel like it was pushing into a hole that had been drilled into his seat.<br />
<br />
Bringing an arm down, Steve felt the area of the seat that was directly behind him and, sure enough, right at butt level, there was a modestly sized hole in the seat that was lined with hard molded plastic.  That hadn’t been there earlier, and yet as Steve ran his hand over it, the workmanship on it certainly felt like it was how the seat had come from the factory.  Reaching behind him towards the back of the seat, Steve felt another hole that had to be connected to the one up against his butt.  <br />
<br />
This was all so strange.  <br />
<br />
Steve tried to open his eyes, only for the skunk smell to intensify to a level he’d never experienced before.  Every inch of leather and every panel in the car seemed to ooze skunk spray, like a thousand skunk asses had been left out in the sun, tied together, and stuck directly into Steve’s face.  His eyes filled with water as the putrid scent burned his corneas, all while his lungs choked on the fetid gas inside of them.<br />
<br />
Coughing and wheezing, Steve felt a pulling on his tailbone as it carried a mass of worming flesh into the hole that had been carved into his seat.  And then, in an instant, the coughing and the burning eyes just stopped.  Steve could still smell the skunk pouring out of the car but for some reason it no longer seemed to bother him. <br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, Steve hoped there was still time – and battery – to fix this.  But as he forced his body upright in his seat, the distinct sensation of multiple jiggling mounds on his chest told him otherwise.<br />
<br />
Steve looked down to the sight his plump nipples – all six of them poking out of the thin white fur that covered his small but lactating breasts.  He brought his hands up to cup the upper pair, only to be distressed at the sight of his short dainty arms covered in black skunk fur.  He felt something brush up against the rear seat and, looking back, Steve could see the poofy black fur and the two white stripes of his body’s newly grown tail.<br />
<br />
He didn’t want to look in the rear-view mirror.  He knew what he would see.   He knew what the skunk girl’s face looked like, and he knew the look of terror that now filled her eyes.  That wasn’t something that he needed to see right now and, fortunately, he was spared from it simply by virtue of how much higher the mirror was relative to his new, shorter stature.<br />
<br />
That just left… his dick.  He could feel it nestled between his feminine thighs, but he knew that wasn’t going to last long.  Just as it had when he’d transformed into a rabbit, a feeling of overwhelming impotence began squeezing down on his cock, causing it to shrink and pull back towards his crotch.  Despite knowing just how futile it was, he still thrust a dainty into his crotch and held it there, pressing his fingers into his dick as it warped into a skunk girl’s nub of a clit.<br />
<br />
Steve’s balls shrunk down until they were flush with the area below his dick.  Then the skin split apart as his lower lips took shape and a tight, muscular tube burrowed its way inside of Steve’s abdomen.  Steve’s womb took shape as he felt something materialize around his neck.  Reaching up towards it, realized that he was now wearing a leather collar with a small metal plaque hanging off the front.  And while he couldn’t see it, he imagined that it looked almost identical to the one that had formed on Austin earlier.<br />
<br />
Was it over?  Steve’s new breasts felt so swollen and, in an effort to relieve the pressure, he gently grasped one of his nipples and gave it a light tug, which resulted in a pressurized stream of milk spraying out and splattering against the steering wheel.  <br />
<br />
Fuck… he was lactating, which meant that he was almost certainly pregnant.  Still, he didn’t feel anything inside of his stomach and, when he looked down past his breasts, all he could see was an otherwise flat stomach.  Maybe he had… just given birth?  Was that how the app had changed his reality?  It would make sense as to why he was lactating so…<br />
<br />
Despite the muzzle occupying the bottom potion of his field of view, Steve could see a glow coming from somewhere in his lap… the phone!  It still had battery!  Bringing it into his field of view, the first thing that Steve saw was that it was sitting at 1% charge.  The second was a popup that said, “Remaining changes will occur in the background to conserve battery life.”  Steve clicked that away and was returned to the sentence selection screen.<br />
<br />
What did the app mean by remaining changes, Steve wondered?  Did that mean that he wasn’t…<br />
<br />
“Urgggh…” Steve moaned as a can of compressed air suddenly exploded inside of his womb.  The pressure was unimaginable as his cervix sealed itself and a wave of amniotic fluid gushed into his womb.  Steve looked down just in time to see his belly button pop out all while stomach continued to swell.  His first instinct was to clasp it in his hands as he tried to push his stomach back into his own body, but that was a futile gesture that couldn’t stop the baby from growing inside of him.<br />
<br />
*The dumb skunk is crowning, but she can’t take her seatbelt off until she’s fully given birth.*<br />
<br />
That phrase that he’d seen on the phone earlier flooded his mind.  “No!” Steve shouted in a desperate, high-pitched voice, “no please!  I didn’t make that sentence; this shouldn’t be happening to me!”<br />
<br />
It was true, Steve had avoided generating the sentence that he’d seen earlier, so why… A flash of inspiration hit him as he felt the seatbelt begin to dig into his continually expanding stomach.  That was it – his stomach was pushing against the seatbelt as it grew and the skunk girl in his vision from earlier had ignored that until the seatbelt had jammed.  That reason that the skunk girl couldn’t get it off was because the only way to relieve that tension on the seatbelt holder was for her belly to shrink.  And the only way for her to do that was to give birth to the baby inside of her.<br />
<br />
As his belly continued to grow bigger and bigger, Steve didn’t wait to go into action.  In the blink of an eye, he flung his slender hand down to the seatbelt holder, jammed his fingers into the release, and breathed a sigh of relief as he heard the distinct *click* of the catch releasing.<br />
<br />
The seatbelt wound back into its holder and, with that disaster averted, all Steve had left to do was sit there and experience the sight and feeling of the baby inside of him growing to the point that the white fur on his belly was brushing up against the steering wheel.<br />
<br />
Steve placed his hands on his oversized belly, feeling the object floating inside of him.  For a brief moment it just stayed still, as though it was in shock from its rapid creation, but that didn’t last long.  It wiggled, then thrashed, and Steve felt the already taut skin that covered his abdomen painfully stretch as it tried to accommodate the creature’s movements.<br />
<br />
“Unffff…” Steve moaned.  Christ.  Steve understood why the skunk girl had cried out that she was going to explode.  The pressure in Steve’s belly was already overwhelming when that thing was staying still, but when it started moving Steve felt like his body would just pop like a balloon. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, the thrashing didn’t last long and, as and the creature inside of Steve calmed down, he wasn’t sure whether he should be thankful or not that he didn’t actually pop.  After all, if his body exploded then things would be over quickly.  On the other hand, giving birth to this thing was going to be every last bit of the nightmare that the skunk girl he’d seen earlier had made it out to be, if not more.</p>
