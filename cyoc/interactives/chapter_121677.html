<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No,&quot; Janice said simply in response to what her mother had said and clutched at Jenny as though her older sister was her mother.<br />
<br />
Jenny did her best to try and stay calm. Being &quot;disowned&quot; wasn&#39;t necessarily something she wanted, but in many ways it was something she expected. However, in her case, about the only real &quot;negative&quot; from that would be in losing out on financial support for college and a spot in any will, both of which Jenny expected when it became clear that she would be remaining in Moon Lake full time. However, much like James Sr. her primary concerns were for Janice and John. Her father had been a borderline abusive father and definitely domineering to all in the Harper family. And while Elizabeth Harper had found herself on the wrong side of James Harper Senior&#39;s anger almost as many times as the Harper children had, there was also the odd fact that she&#39;d also support him despite his abusive behavior. That drove, Jenny to push for &quot;emancipation&quot; for Janice and John and have them remain in Moon Lake with her. As she felt Janice&#39;s arms wrap around her waist, Jenny took one small step forward to defend her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Elizabeth Harper took one step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said, &quot;no,&quot; and I can&#39;t blame her,&quot; Jenny answered doing her best to hold her temper, &quot;Dad&#39;s definition of love is dominate and make everyone try and obey him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They say to honor thy father and mother,&quot; Elizabeth answered with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;One does not honor a tyrant,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;Dad beat us... He beat YOU... He&#39;s never let you work, even when you&#39;ve brought up the idea of helping in that regard. He never gave ANYONE a choice. That isn&#39;t love. That isn&#39;t caring. That&#39;s domination, and it isn&#39;t the way to live. It&#39;s abuse, and that isn&#39;t right. And in that... I am laying legal claim that you and dad pose a threat to the health ad safety of Janice and John and urge their emancipation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emancipation...&quot; Elizabeth said slowly with narrowed eyes as she looked to Jenny and then to James Jr. and then two the two adult women there. &quot;You can&#39;t do that here! This ain&#39;t Alabama.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it is Washington State,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;and with the fact that Jennifer Jenkins has filed for residency in the state shortly after the college year started, she can file for emancipation... It would be an odd case, as the one filing will be doing so on behalf of others, but on a technicality, Jennifer can do so in Washington State...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d ask you to stay out of this, this isn&#39;t your business,&quot; Elizabeth snapped.<br />
<br />
Samantha came forward and stared Elisabeth down, &quot;as Town Chancellor of Moon Lake, it IS my business when ANY OUTSIDERS come into my town under the PRETEXT of causing trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth backed away nervously as the door to the visitors area, though her focus was on the woman who had come forward and spoken quite authoritatively toward her. It left her a bit nervous as she looked around the waiting room. The soft tones, normally meant to comfort those worried about a sick relative did nothing and Elizabeth found herself looking more for some form of escape or support. But there didn&#39;t seem to be any.  Jenny and James Jr. stood defiantly in front of her, with Janice clutching at Jenny&#39;s waist and John standing nervously behind Jenny and James Junior. The one woman that she&#39;d gotten to back down stood quietly with a look that Elizabeth saw was soft and caring, but not one that indicated that she was going to support her efforts. And then there was the woman who had just stated she was the Town Chancellor standing to her immediate left with narrowed eyes. It left Elizabeth with little she could do.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; Elizabeth said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can and I will,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;All I need to do is fill out the paperwork with the courts, and unless dad is going to be fit to walk out today... then I have time to handle that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth cringed and looked behind her to the doorway that lead from the waiting area and into the areas of the cardiac wing where Doctor Tachibana stood quietly, and with a obvious frown on his face, though he was also focused on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you and dad somehow manage to leave before Jen can, I&#39;ll file on their behalf in Alabama,&quot; James Jr. added, &quot;It may not be true emancipation in the sense that John and Janice take care of themselves... but closer to custody hearings in a divorce... It&#39;d be odd, but I&#39;d wager the case could be made... and given Dad&#39;s habit of burning bridges...the case can be made he would be a threat to Janice and John...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calling them heathens would reinforce that point,&quot; Samantha said pointedly.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth couldn&#39;t answer, &quot;but I am their mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that means I&#39;m supposed to let you let dad abuse them?&quot; Jenny said firmly, &quot;no... I cannot let that happen. If you don&#39;t wish to take a stand and make dad treat you right... that&#39;s your business, mom, but I cannot and I will not let you let him abuse John and Janice because he didn&#39;t get what he wanted in having me marry a criminal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And one who would have likely NEVER acted on all the promises he&#39;s made over the years,&quot; James Jr. commented, &quot;many of which went beyond what one would expect on the salary he had running the power company, which could well mean that he was involved in MORE than what he was involved in here... I mean... are you REALLY going to defend a man who hired other men to kill an innocent for no reason other that the killer wanted the same woman? Is that REALLY the Christian thing to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth didn&#39;t answer and looked down, ignoring the sound of the of a door opening and closing. She had no way win such an argument. She didn&#39;t think on losing grandchildren and certain ways she didn&#39;t personally have any problem with who James Jr. married. It didn&#39;t sit right with her, but privately she was able to look past it, but she couldn&#39;t just go with the lack of respect given to James Senior. After all, he HAD raised them, provided for them, protected them from those that would do them real harm and not just discipline. In that James Sr. did deserve some respect, and while there were some things he did that Elizabeth didn&#39;t agree with on James Senior&#39;s decisions, that didn&#39;t make him a bad man. In fact there had been times when he had been quite kind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t afford to...&quot; Elizabeth spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer may not... but I can,&quot; came a new voice, definitely feminine and sounding a bit older.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth looked up to see newly arrived oriental woman in a beautiful kimono, made from fine silk and with some exquisite designs. Though even with the traditional Japanese garment, it was pretty hard to hide her figure and that dispute a couple grey hairs she looked fairly beautiful, in a way. Like what a classic Japanese noble would look like in in a painting. The woman nodded to Harry and put a hand on Jenny&#39;s shoulder. She walked with a certain air of both authority and regality. It was something that Elizabeth couldn&#39;t place, but she noticed that Jenny, Harry, and particularly Doctor Tachibana seemed to pay this woman a huge amount of respect. The woman looked to Elizabeth with a stern look that matched Samantha&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Tachibana no Akane...&quot; the woman spoke clearly, &quot;Or for those who insist on putting the surname last... Akane no Tachibana. Corporate CEO of Tachibana Enterprises... or Industries... your press has used both from time to time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Elizabeth backed up. She wanted to make some statement that it wasn&#39;t this Japanese woman&#39;s business, but in a way she felt cornered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while I have not worked at the local college, I have heard through the philanthropic circles that I do travel on the kindness and intelligence of your oldest daughter... How she has sought to help her friends and Moon Lake grow. Truly an astounding commitment from someone who only just moved here for college. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... I suppose,&quot; Elizabeth managed. &quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with stories of her kindness and intelligence, I couldn&#39;t help but find out what was out there on the family that had produced such a kind and caring woman,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;as surely such kindness came from something noble...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth was about to say something, but Akane didn&#39;t even give her the chance to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet what I found... mostly in published police records and news reports, honestly left me quite surprised,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;the frequent calls related to domestic violence... occasional drunk and disorderly conduct. Not something that would be associated with one so kind... and in the end left a for a lot of wasted potential. Such kindness... such intelligence... would be better served healing the sick providing help to those that need it... like Doctor Twist here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth followed a gentle gesture as Akane waved her arm to point to Frances for a moment. After that, Akane simply moved her hands back so that she held her own hands in front of he and kept her dark brown eyes focused on Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the world needs kindness in it,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;sometimes, I think if people had a bit more kindness in their hearts and lives, there would be greater progress. People wouldn&#39;t obsess over things like money and then either see those with money horde it and those without money turning to thievery and therefore hurting others. There wouldn&#39;t be this obsession with power. Politicians would care more for the good of the many and not over who is in power to lay claim for the good and then find blame for the bad. And parents would learn that children are treasures to be loved and encouraged so that they may go free to carry that kindness into the world...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth found herself unable to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame, really,&quot; Akane gave a sigh, but kept a very stern focus on Elizabeth, &quot;but then... no one&#39;s utopia has ever come true... But still... I could not sit by and let the kindness and intelligence your oldest daughter has be wasted on a backward thinking fool who&#39;s stuck in the 1800s. And so... I have made sure the kindness Jennifer possesses is not brought down... that her intelligence is not broken, to help ensure her wedding was protected from those who would do wrong and that she may be free and happy with her choices. And if that means a legal fight... I am WELL prepared for that, if it means someone who deserves justice gets it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth slunk bank. She knew that in theory a good lawyer could probably beat whatever attempt that Jenny or James Jr. had with regard to emancipating Janice or John... or at least changing their custody.  However, she also knew that they likely couldn&#39;t afford one. They&#39;d have plenty of trouble as it was, as James Sr. would now have huge medical bills to pay and wouldn&#39;t be able to return to work as a lineman because of his condition. Of course, maybe he could take over Wilhelm&#39;s spot at the head of the company if the criminal charges stuck, but Elizabeth couldn&#39;t know how that would work, and even if James Sr. could, he&#39;d still need to apply for it. A part of her thought through the idea of seeing if that sewing store still needed help or did need help, but even with that, she knew that neither she nor James Sr. could avoid a drawn out legal fight.<br />
<br />
With the lack of an answer, Akane turned to Doctor Tachibana.<br />
<br />
&quot;He will live, mother,&quot; Tora spoke respectfully, &quot;though in his present condition it would be best that he remain here for the next few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded and turned Jenny and Harry, &quot;I do mean what I say. If this will be a drawn out fight... I will handle the legal fees. The two of you deserve that much. And that is why I&#39;ve come... to provide you with the assurances that you have my support.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Tachibana,&quot; Jenny said softly. Some of this likely related to the debt the Skulk felt for her transformation being initiated by a rogue, but in many ways from what contact she&#39;d had with Akane, she felt like she could trust her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see to it that help is provided in filling out the appropriate forms with regard to the freeing of your siblings,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;though with it being the weekend, you may have to wait until Monday to get them and fill them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry nodded. James Jr. stood in quiet awe at the moment, though the mention of the word &quot;Monday&quot; presented some issues. He&#39;d need to call both the college he was attending and his part time job to inform them on the circumstances of what had happened. And judging by his mother&#39;s seeming inability to try and take charge, he&#39;d likely need to call Janice and John&#39;s school as well to let them know that John and Janice likely wouldn&#39;t be in school for a few days. The issue with transferring records to Moon Lake could wait until the legal matters were settled... That could be problematic, but then, it might give him some more time to catch up with Jenny and get to know Harry better. <br />
<br />
Harry seemed like a good enough guy and to James Jr. that was good enough. The only negative that James Jr. felt was there was the fact that things had been so rushed that there was no chance to get to know him better before the wedding. Of course, James Jr. also admitted that a lot of that was probably a combination of Dieter Wilhelm and James Senior, but that was past. Getting to know him would be nice. Not to mention there would be the need to get contact numbers to let him and Jenny know when he and Aisha would have their wedding, as having family at weddings was crucial. And regardless of James Senior&#39;s nonsense, Jenny was family and now, so was Harry.<br />
<br />
James Junior followed Akane with his eyes as she finished her conversation with Jenny and Harry concerning the legal forms, gave a nod to Samantha and then departed. He was still amazed by that. He&#39;d known that his mother had often differed on nearly everything when it came to James Harper Senior, but when it did come to an argument, Elizabeth Harper had never been a light-weight. It was that sort of thing that had lead to some of the police calls that created issues with regard to potential domestic disturbance. James Sr. came home drunk, complained over something and then an inevitable argument followed. Elizabeth, usually arguing that her husband wasted too much on beer and set a bad example and James Sr. complaining that his dinner wasn&#39;t kept hot. But, yet, Elizabeth Harper remained dedicated to James Senior, which at times seemed impossible to understand.<br />
<br />
Regardless of that, James Jr. was still in awe that this Akane no Tachibana had essentially been able to &quot;win&quot; an argument with his mother without turning it a physical confrontation and that she managed to do it without Elizabeth even managing a response. It was something that James Jr. had never seen before and could not being in awe over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to stay with Jenny,&quot; Janice declared, looking between Jenny and James Jr. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna be a nun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think I&#39;d rather stay here too,&quot; John commented.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth only sighed and sank into a nearby chair. Nothing in her husband&#39;s plan seemed to be working and she had likely lost the opportunity to see any grandchildren.</p>
