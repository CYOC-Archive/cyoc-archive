<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aaah! Monster!&quot; Rico said, stumbling backward over the couch. Had this dog creature really been made in a lab somewhere? Maybe by his own mad-scientist girlfriend? He&#39;d seen enough monster movies to know this couldn&#39;t end well. Hiding under his couch, trying to figure out how easily he could get to his gun from here, Rico contemplated scenarios in his head to stop the menace here, before the whole town was eaten or infected by these things. A familiar whimpering sound stopped his mental machinations in their tracks. Peeking up from behind the couch, he witnessed a heart-wrenching sight: a canine creature that really did look and sound a lot like the police dog he&#39;d grown accustomed to, whimpering and flattening its ears like one of the many abused canines he&#39;d recovered during in his time on the force. It sobbed and covered its eyes with its paws and ran into the bedroom, much like Shelly did when she was getting emotional. Rico started to consider the possibility that he had misjudged the creature.<br />
<br />
Getting up and stepping cautiously toward the bedroom, he found the dog woman sulking on the edge of the bed, looking down at herself dejectedly. Somewhat surprised that the entity didn&#39;t seem to want to kill him, and not yet entirely certain that it wouldn&#39;t, he watched it in awe from the doorway, juggling his own surprise, fear, and guilt within his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it? I am a monster,&quot; it said in Shelly&#39;s voice without lifting its head to look at him, staring tearfully at its own paws. &quot;I don&#39;t know what Shelly was thinking! Well, that&#39;s not quite true,&quot; it clarified, sobbing between phrases, &quot;I do have all her memories, and Officer Badge&#39;s as well. Shelly really thought it was going to work this time! When I first stepped out of the exit chamber, I was thrilled that I--that she had been right. They both--we both--just wanted to make you proud, even if one of us turned out to be a bit too reckless. Now I&#39;m stuck like this, as a victim of my own mad science, with no idea how to go about life as your ex-girlfriend mixed with what&#39;s left of your canine partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rico sat down and put his hand on the creature&#39;s furry back, making it flinch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; he apologized, &quot;to whatever extent you&#39;re Shelly, you aren&#39;t the only one who was reckless. They don&#39;t assign just anyone to a K-9 unit, and I knew better than to let you try this. I hate to say this, but it isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve abused my position on the force. The whole department does it, and I always think I can convince special favors for my girlfriend are okay because at least I didn&#39;t beat somebody senseless or embezzle confiscated drugs for people I know. I&#39;m sorry I called you a monster. And I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve already got you calling yourself my ex-girlfriend before we&#39;ve even had time to figure out where we stand after all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shelly leaned into Rico for a hug, and Rico heard Badge&#39;s tail thumping the bed behind her. Part of him was disgusted that the &quot;person&quot; in his arms was part-human and part-dog, but another part of his was fascinated that she really seemed to be both Shelly and Officer Badge and relieved that he had possibly managed to make up with both of them at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so sweet,&quot; she said, rubbing his bare chest with her padded hands. &quot;I do love you, as much as I did before this happened. But surely you would never want to be with me now that we&#39;re only partially the same species? Besides, I haven&#39;t shown you the rest of it.&quot; Shelly/Badge stood up again in front of Rico and pulled off the womanly underwear which had been uncomfortably pinched underneath her/his tail. Rico&#39;s eyes widened at what he saw. He&#39;d seen Badge naked countless times, and never thought twice about that fuzzy brown pouch between his legs that any similar dog might have. He&#39;d also seen Shelly naked in some very intimate moments, and the feminine labia before him were a well-known port of entry at this point. Seeing them both on the same body was giving him feelings he wasn&#39;t sure how to interpret. It was disgusting, it was unearthly, it was new, it was familiar, it was comforting, it was inviting, it was arousing!<br />
<br />
Arousing? That can&#39;t be right, can it? Well, it could. Something about seeing his girlfriend and his dog&#39;s naked bodies together was turning Rico on. Knowing that Shelly still had the anatomy to make love to him came as a relief to a very sexual aspect of himself. Of course, he&#39;d never had sexual feelings for Officer Badge before, but Officer Badge had never had woman&#39;s sexual parts before, or a woman&#39;s sexy voice pouring out his emotions the way Shelly did. He wasn&#39;t gay, and would normally be disgusted by the concept of fucking a male, but he&#39;d never considered the possibility of making love to a male who was also a female. For better or for worse, seeing Shelly and Officer Badge naked in his room as a singular being had a way of mixing up his feelings for both of them in such a way that he didn&#39;t know what he should feel. For better or for worse, his own towl-hidden testicles were rapidly deciding for him, his own male virility interpreting all of this emotional tension as sexual tension. They could figure out how to navigate the aftermath of this later. For now, Rico needed to calm down his treasured canine partner, and he needed show his long-time girlfriend that she was still beautiful. For now, he needed to know what their combined body was capable of in this moment.<br />
<br />
Rico stood up from the bed to join them, dropping his towel, making sure his conversation partner could clearly see his erection. He reached a hand around their shoulders, relishing the smooth, feminine frame and the lush canine fur beneath his touch. His transformed girlfriend opened her (his?) mouth to say something, but Rico put his finger against her her lips to shush her, telling her that he was still here and everything was okay. She sniffed his finger as eagerly as Badge would sniff a box of dog biscuits, drinking in the scent of his human masculinity--and his arousal. The familiar pink penis of a canine emerged from the sheath, a bestial mockery of Rico&#39;s own erection, seemingly daring him to prove his continued sexual prowess. Soon, both bodies were locked in the throes of a unearthly kiss: Rico&#39;s tongue was dwarfed by the one in Badge&#39;s muzzle, but the way the dog tongue tickled the inside of his mouth had Shelly&#39;s famed kissing ability written all over it. They fell down on the bed, Rico&#39;s penis went into his lover, and their warm bodies rubbed against each other with the heat of a thousand suns. The rows of canine nipples on Shelldog&#39;s furry belly had never been stimulated this way before, and had never stimulated a lover the way they did in this moment.</p>
