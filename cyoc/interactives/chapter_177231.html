<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden woke up to a darkened bedroom, the only source of light being the cheap Christmas lights that Mark had purchased for “mood lighting”. He stretched and yawned, realizing that he had slept through the afternoon and well into the evening! He propped himself up on his elbows, noticing the warm, but also slightly sore, feeling coming from his pussy. Aiden couldn’t believe he’d let Mark drag him into his bedroom like that, much less enthusiastically let him plow his brand-new pussy. He felt slightly ashamed, but also proud and aroused, he rolled over in the sheets, keen on snoozing for maybe a few more minutes when was jolted wide awake by the sensation of the sheets running over hos now ultra-sensitive nipples. <br />
<br />
He pulled the sheets away and examined his chest, finding his pectorals were firmer and a little better defined than when he’d fallen asleep. His nipples were large and erect; lightly fingering his left nipple Aiden found it to be almost as sensitive as the head of his cock, or his clitoris in this case. Reluctantly removing his fingers, he looked down further; his stomach was tight and smooth, his arms leanly muscled. The sparse hair that had covered his chest, under and over his arms, his legs, it was all gone. He traced his fingers along his smooth, tanned skin, finding it also to be quite sensitive to the touch. When he looked down at his pussy, he noticed it had undergone some changes as well. His pubic hair was neatly trimmed, his labia neat and puffy, and his clitoris slightly engorged. Aiden was shocked at his new features, certain that this was not part of his original programming. Mark must have screwed with the chronivac while he was asleep! Aiden was furious; the least he could have done was give him his cock back after how expertly he had taken the giant thing. Alex leapt out of bed, stumbling a bit as he adjusted to a knew sense of his height and weight. Looking in the mirror confirmed that Mark seemed to have dropped his height by a few inches, and he had obviously gained weight in muscle tone. He left Marks room in the nude, too incensed to stop by his room and grab clothes.<br />
<br />
Slow-tempo house music was wafting down the hall from the living room. Aiden followed the sound to find the room dark but for the lamp in the corner, next to the armchair. Perched upon the armchair was a thick, hairy, behemoth of a man, naked and casually sipping whiskey from a old-fashioned glass that looked like a shot glass in his massive hand. <br />
<br />
Taken aback by the sight, Aiden lost the wind from his sails and stared in awe and bewilderment at the man.<br />
<br />
“How was your beauty sleep, pussyboy?” the big man rumbled in a rich, deep tenor. He looked to Aiden to be in his mid, to maybe late, thirties. <br />
<br />
“M-Mark?” exclaimed Aiden in disbelief. “Is that you?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely, my pussified-friend, all six-foot, nine-inches of me.” He growled with pride.<br />
<br />
Mark had definitely had a good time changing things up on the chronivac. His muscles, while well developed before, were enormous and covered in a healthy layer of fat. His broad pectorals made a firm and powerful shelf looming over Mark’s new muscle gut. His whole body was covered in a tangled network of coarse, dark hairs, from his chest and his back, all the way down his tree-trunk legs to his enormous feet. His thick head of hair was gone, buzzed short against his scalp, and a thick, neatly trimmed beard belied a square-jawed, masculine looking face with deep, dark eyes. But by far Mark’s most impressive feature was the enhanced tool sleeping patiently between his legs. Aiden could tell he was soft, and yet Mark’s new cock was as thick and long soft as his original cock had been when hard. A burgeoning purple tip peaked out from the thick foreskin, and his balls were now the size of oranges, resting in a low hanging sack. Aiden licked his lips and stared for a moment longer before shaking himself and remembering what Mark had done.<br />
<br />
“You change me in my sleep, asshole!” he tried to snarl angrily, but the sight of the virile specimen that Mark had transformed himself into was extremely distracting.<br />
<br />
“I took the liberty of making some minor adjustments,” Mark purred, finishing his drink and pouring himself another. “I enjoyed that new pussy of yours so much I just had to keep it around for a little while longer. And I thought, why not make some changes that we’ll both enjoy.” Mark’s hand drifted down and began to caress his new and improved tool.<br />
<br />
“Like making my nipples as sensitive as dicks? Or shaving off all my body hair? I guess I should be grateful I didn’t wake up with long hair and tits.” He said, crossing his arms and then yelping and dropping them when they touched the nipples in question. <br />
<br />
Mark just laughed. “I thought about it, but you looked so perfect with a neat little pussy on your male body. So I just made some minor tweaks. Don’t worry, I have enough fur for the both of us now,” he growled, rubbing his other hand across the pelt on his expansive chest. <br />
<br />
Aiden thought about and wondered, “Well, what else did you change?” he asked tentatively. <br />
<br />
A look of excitement crept over the man’s bearded face, breaking into a toothy, wolfish grin that made Aiden’s heart sink and his pussy throb. “Some important things. Like for starters, making sure that you don’t surprise me with any “Mark Juniors”.” <br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Aiden wasn’t feeling great about this…<br />
<br />
“Now, every time a man cums inside of you, it will make you lustfully and dutifully subservient to his every command. No pregnancies, no monthlies.” He stated, still with his smile.<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s a load off…Wait, what? You made me your sex slave?” he said skeptically.<br />
<br />
Mark shook his head. “Not exactly; when a man comes inside of you, you will feel an overwhelming since of lust and attraction towards him, which will compel you to follow his, or in this case, My, every command.” He put his drink down on the table. <br />
<br />
“Bullshit, there’s no way you can just crook your big sausage fingers and…”’<br />
<br />
But Mark cut him off with a stern look and a commanding tone. “Suck my fat cock, slut.” <br />
<br />
Aiden wanted to finish his sentence and tell Mark to fuck off but he found his mouth muffled by something hot and thick, stretching his jaw beyond what he thought he was capable of. He realized that the moment Mark had issued his command, Aiden had unconsciously crossed the room and begun sucking Mark’s giant schlong without even breaking his train of thought. Aiden wanted to pull away and stop, but he found he could only back up as far as the head of Mark’s cock; something was compelling him to refuse to take Mark’s cock out of his mouth for any reason, unless Mark were to change his mind. And he knew that Sir was the kind of man who finished what he started. Wait, ‘Sir’? Where had that come from.<br />
<br />
“As you can see,” Mark spoke while Aiden slowly gave in to the compulsion and began to expertly lick and massage the head and first few inches of his shaft. “No matter how much you may want to, you can’t lift yourself from my cock until you make me cum or I tell you to stop. And I’m not telling you to stop.” He said in a gravely tone. “So, you just enjoy your place between my legs and keep your Daddy happy while I explain some of my other adjustments to our life.”<br />
<br />
Aiden dutifully sucked his man’s cock, his pussy practically gushing as Mark slowly assumed his dominance over his cockless roommate. His ministrations were quickly bringing Mark to full erection; Aiden groaned as he felt the cock expand and delve deeper down his throat. It felt as thick and wide around as a soda bottle; his eyes streamed, his jaw felt stretched to the limit, but there was no pain, no uncomfortable stretching. Aiden also found that he was able to fully close his mouth around Mark’s cock and breath through his nose with no trouble at all; his gag reflex was as non-existent as his cock. <br />
<br />
“That’s right; you’ll never have trouble deepthroating again. You won’t run into any issues getting a deep-dicking either; your mouth, your ass, and of course you’re sweet little pussy, have all been modified to comfortably and pleasurably receive any cock of any size. And Maybe not just cocks, either.” He said devilishly. He watched Alex work on his cock with proud satisfaction. <br />
<br />
“Your ass and your throat now lubricate themselves as well; I made your nipples and skin more sensitive. Then of course,” he flexed his cock inside Aiden’s throat and chuckled when the boy squealed from around his cock. “There’s the changes I made to myself. Starting with a throbbing 18 inches of Grade A man-meat, with a twelve inch girth. At least for now.” Mark leaned his head back and groaned as he concentrated on his cock, and Aiden wheezed as he felt Mark’s cock grow thicker and longer within him; Aiden could literally feel it in his stomach as the schlong approached beyond two feet in length. <br />
<br />
“I can make my cock and balls any size I want them to be. And this beast never goes soft or slows down unless I want it too. I made some moderate changes to the outside world, but you and I can explore that when we go out tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Out?” Aiden tried to say around Mark’s mighty cock, but it only came out as a muffled grunt.<br />
<br />
“That’s right. I felt that since you’re being such a good little slut, taking care of your man, I might as well meet you half way by making a big change in my life.” He gestured at his thick, svelte, musclebear body. “I made myself gay; thought I’d play on your team for awhile and have my fun.”<br />
<br />
“A’n e nut!” Aiden grunted into Mark’s coarse pubes.<br />
<br />
“What’s that? You may pause sucking my cock to speak.” He commanded again.<br />
<br />
Aiden gratefully withdrew Mark’s cock from his throat, watching in awe as the cock reduced its length and grith slightly, but remained steel-pipe hard. <br />
<br />
“And then what?” Aiden breathed; his hand still encircled around Mark’s shaft. <br />
<br />
“And then, after a while, we change back. Or maybe we stay like this if we really like it. I don’t know. I just changed myself into a swarthy, hairy, gay muscle-bear, after I fucked a man with a pussy. I’m feeling pretty open minded.” He said. Then he gave Aiden that same domineering stare again and commanded, “Now finish sucking my meat, and we can shower and get ready.” He said, leaning his head back on his folded hands. Aiden literally didn’t need to be told twice before diving down on Marks heavenly schlong. Mark teased Aiden by experimenting with different cock lengths and girths, watching the young pussy boy do his work while he planned out the fun evening ahead of them.</p>
