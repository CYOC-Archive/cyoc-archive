<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Trigger Warning <br/>
This scene involves some violence that may be disturbing to some readers.<br/>
While no sex or transformations in this chapter, it helps in character building for other chapters i am writing.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Weston removed his cap and wiped his brow for the 7th time that day. <br />
A number he remembered because he had counted.<br />
He had counted because he only wiped his brow when he was nervous.<br />
He was nervous because he loved his family.<br />
He was nervous because he was a police officer required to enforce a new law that few people truly understood.<br />
He was nervous because he saw conflict between his work and family approaching fast.<br />
Finally, he was nervous because he had realized he had fucked up.<br />
<br />
That morning Officer Weston had picked approached what appeared to be two young teenage boys and their similar aged male indecent &#39;pup&#39;. The pup had no identifying tattoo, leash, tag or cock ring but instead of bringing the boys back to the station and finding and fining their irresponsible parents. Officer Weston had been sweet talked into dropping the boys off at the Indecent Infarctors store to get replacement gear. That would not have been so bad if those same boys had not emerged from that store less then an hour later, morphed into 18 year old muscular versions of themselves. <br />
<br />
Officer Weston realized his mistake now, after dropping off supplies to the head office and sat down to type up his reports. It should have been easy to identify the indecent involved, with a distinctive name like Nol&#39;, short for Nolan, as the young teen had blabbered on about during the ride to the store. You think his name was Fred?<br />
<br />
Yet there was no record of an indecent named Nolan or Nol&#39; in the computer, even after expanding the database statewide, the computer just kept coming back with “No Matches Found”.  The sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach grew, as his mind followed the events down the rabbit hole of his imagination to piece things together.<br />
<br />
Were those kids just being stupid and not knowing about the “nude” law? Were they from further away, and if so why were they traveling by themselves? Perhaps runaways? Perhaps escapees from attempted abusers of the law?<br />
But if so why did they seem so calm coming out of the store in their new bodies? Excited even?<br />
<br />
Eight times.<br />
<br />
Officer Weston replaced his cap as he gave up on answering those questions, deciding the reports would have to be done later he logged off. He would ask the chief some advice quickly before heading out on patrol but typing the report could wait.<br />
<br />
Heading towards the Chiefs office, the unmistakable muffled noise of two men arguing could be heard, the frosted glass doing little to hide their expressive arm movements as one of them paced back and forth. One person would be the Chief of Police Sylvio Hernandez, and he had a pretty good idea who the other person was.<br />
Approaching the, Officer Weston paused, pressing his ear to the door.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t care if it USED to be illegal, the law has changed and you have to UPHOLD it. Even if you don&#39;t like how it has changed!”<br />
<br />
“But chief, those faggots are naked and having fucking orgies in there! I barely stopped my kid walking in on em&#39;”<br />
<br />
“I know! The politicians rushed the law through and they are now having to work through the finer details to make it work for very day people. However the big bosses up top, in FBI, department of defense and event the supreme court have said that in the meantime it is perfectly legal in those non enforceable zones.”<br />
<br />
“But Chief-”<br />
<br />
“And yes I know that includes the public toilets in the park where you take your kids on the weekend, but until the law is refined or changed, there is only so much you can do.”<br />
<br />
“Goddammit Sylvio, Can&#39;t you see my side in -”<br />
<br />
“Jim. Shut up, sit down and listen or hand in your badge right now!”<br />
<br />
A long silence occurs before the sound of a chair being pulled out restarts the conversation.<br />
<br />
“Ok. Good Jim. Right. Here is what you CAN and CAN&#39;T do. You can use your right to free speech and discourage people, but watch your language when in that uniform. No swearing, no racism, no calling people faggots or other nasty shit and no threats of violence or arrest. Secondly, can arrest them if they leave the bounds of the &#39;non enforceable&#39; area with any sexual part exposed, or if they are standing on the threshold  in view of the public. You cannot ask to verify indecent registration inside but you can ask immediately outside. Do you start to catch my drift here?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I think I do. They can take an inch but we won&#39;t give em a mile. Right?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly. Conduct yourself as a professional while in the uniform. Enforce the law as it is, just be aware what the finer details are, and keep checking the policy updates as they come through. The law is being challenged and shaped in every court, in every possible way throughout the country. It will NOT stay as it is.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Chief.” Jims voice sounding deflated but reassured.<br />
<br />
“No worries, Jim. Now-”<br />
<br />
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK<br />
<br />
“Come in! I&#39;ll see you later Jim. Mark come in, take a seat. What can I do for you?”<br />
Jim stood slowly, Mark staring at his light brown hair in short boxy shaped cut, along with his angular jaw giving his head a rectangular shape. His steely grey eyes giving Mark a scornful gaze, authoritative despite being several inches shorter then Officer Weston. Mark found Jim always rubbed him the wrong way, with his cocky swagger when he walked, his too tight pants that displayed a large but indistinct bulge in his groin, and his indignation when anyone looks.<br />
Mark nodded briefly at Jim, taking a small glance at the large beefy ass walking away,  before closing the door and taking a seat.<br />
<br />
“This “Nude” law is really something ain&#39;t it. Completely turned the way the law works overnight. Hole worlds gone a little crazy...” <br />
Mark said wiping his brow a 9th time.<br />
<br />
“ I know Mark but what specifically did you come to talk to me about?”<br />
Chief Hernandez stroked his 5o&#39;clock shadow as he scrutinized Mark Weston. The two having years of history and a good working relationship, Sylvio knew that Mark only really came to him in times of need.<br />
<br />
“Is this about the divorce?” Sylvio inquired, noticing that Mark did not show any of his usual tells, so sat silently until he started talking.<br />
<br />
“Its just this new law seems to override every other law in the book in some way, and as a result, every single decision or choice I make on the job is now so much harder as a result. Like earlier today, to teen kids and their indecent are out walking without a collar or leash. I check on them, they say they forgot their bag of gear on the bus, and ask for a ride to the infarctors and I give it to them, but-”<br />
<br />
“But you wonder if you should have been tougher and brought them in, some tough love, so to speak, so they will be more careful in looking after their human &#39;pet&#39;?”<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah. There&#39;s a bit more too it then that but if I had brought them in the other stuff wouldn&#39;t really matter and-”<br />
<br />
“Did you see them get the appropriate gear from the store?”<br />
<br />
“um. Well, yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Then you have done nothing wrong in showing some leniency to the young. I know some officers like Jim Callaway would disagree, especially with your nephews delinquent behavior annoying some of them, but I think you made the right choice.”<br />
<br />
Mark sat silent for a moment, letting everything soak in. He knew he should say the other details, but Sylvio brining up his nephew, had taken the wind out of his sails, and right now he just wanted to take a shower and go home to bed.<br />
RING RING<br />
<br />
RING RING<br />
<br />
“Excuse me Mark, I have to take this. Hello?”<br />
<br />
Mark watched as Sylvio&#39;s eyes narrowed, listening intently, and not interrupting the other person.<br />
<br />
“I see. I&#39;ll address this personally. Thank You.”<br />
<br />
Hanging up the phone Sylvio ran his thumb and index finger across his slight stubble again.<br />
<br />
“Mark. How many processing kits were in the order from the infarctors you collected?”<br />
<br />
“Uhhh. Twelve.”<br />
<br />
“Twelve. Hmmmmm. Not nearly enough. I will call ahead and you will need to drive over and collect another 20 immediately. The local college has just had a mass streaking event and we have about 20 indecents to apprehend and process, as well as a panicking crowd of spectators to calm.”<br />
<br />
Mark stared wide eyed for a long moment before jumping to his feet. This was a huge event for a town of only 300 thousand people.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Sir!” Mark stated loudly before hurrying out the door.<br />
<br />
Sylvio rubbed his chin one more time, taking a deep breath and willing his migraine to go away. The “nude” law had pushed him to his mental limits and beyond, and it had only just come into effect. <br />
<br />
Quickly standing up, he got to work, walking through the department, orders flying, people scuttling and in 3 short minutes, the towns entire police force had been mobilized. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
 Officer Weston was halfway to the Infarctors when he received a call via dispatch.<br />
<br />
“Officer Weston, come in. Over.”<br />
<br />
“Weston here. Go ahead. Over.”<br />
<br />
“Weston, we have orders for you to take a detour to a domestic disturbance en route to your current job. All other units are currently engaged at the campus riot. Over”<br />
<br />
“Copy that dispatch,  whats the address? Over”<br />
<br />
<br />
Officer Weston Arrived at a small wooden home, the sound of yelling and screaming in the background.<br />
Taking a deep breath, he put himself into his focused frame of mind, analytical and low emotion, ready for anything.<br />
Approaching the door cautiously, The sound of a glass shattering and a woman screaming caused him to pull his gun.<br />
<br />
First checking the windows, he could see a drunken man pacing around a living room, knocking over furniture before throwing another empty beer bottle at the wall and storming out of the room, leaving a crying teenage girl huddled in the corner. Entering the house with his gun drawn, Officer Weston found the man pissing with the door open, and had the man promptly cuffed to radiator pipe in the bathroom as soon as his bladder was empty.<br />
<br />
A quick computer check revealed the address had been visited multiple times by other officers for domestic violence, public drunkenness, and noise complaints. Listening to the daughter, the man, her step-father, had come home drunk after an argument with their step-mother. Their birth mother was incarcerated and their step-father had remarried.<br />
The argument stemmed from the girls having some boys over while their parents were out, but one of the boys got very rough and scared her. Her neighbors heard the screams and called the step-dad&#39;s mobile. As they didn&#39;t want to involve the police and get more ire from the drunken slob. The step father was irate because the girls had boys over, they had interrupted his weekend long drinking binge, and they had left their little brother alone with an indecent.<br />
<br />
Officer Weston knew there was more to the story then the girl was telling, but she declined medical treatment and wasn&#39;t raising any other red flags. The only issue was that the father hadn&#39;t laid a hand on any of the children when he got home, and therefore, other then being drunk and noisy, hadn&#39;t done anything wrong enough to warrant an arrest. Although clearly the house wasn&#39;t safe or appropriate for children right now.<br />
<br />
Officer Weston sighed, wiping his brow for the 10th time that day before asking the girls what she wanted to do. At this point her redheaded sister had arrived with another friend from high school, and they were sorted with a place to stay for a few weeks at least. One less headache to sort out.<br />
That just left the younger brother.<br />
The friends family wouldn&#39;t take in a 10 year boy temporarily, they were going above and beyond taking in two teenage girls.<br />
This meant Mark would have to make some calls. <br />
Heading to the bathroom he uncuffed the father, who while grumpy did not seem upset in the slightest that his two teenage step-daughters had just left. Barely able to walk, Officer Weston helped the stumbling man down the hallway towards his room. It was here that they came across Toby.<br />
<br />
“Whatryadoinoutyarumyaliddle faggot.” The man slurred his words, dripping in venom towards the young child.<br />
Mark almost dropped the man, the unbridled venom is his voice cutting right through his focused state and building rage up within him. He knew drunks like this all too well, maybe a little too well.<br />
<br />
“I came out to see the policeman. Bruce.” The small boy said matter of factly, but quietly, his feet set to run if anything happened. Mark looked into the boys large brown eyes, seeing the faded tatty shirt and old shorts with lots of small holes in them, expecting to see a small quaking child, terrified of the drunken beast charging around his home, but instead he saw a glint of light in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Itoldyerto – call me, *hic, DAD!” Bruce roared as he suddenly gained his balance, spun himself around, and flung Mark against through an open door. <br />
Mark was dimly aware of a loud TWANG as his head hit something hard and metallic, and as his vision faded to black, hew saw his own father looming over him. Saw himself as that same small scared child trembling in the corner.<br />
<br />
Toby stood in the hallway, feet poised to sprint sideways, knowing his dad was about to charge towards him, and being as drunk as he was, not likely to be able to swerve before ending up in the back yard.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
In the last few hours, Toby had taken the chance to act on his inner curiosity and urges. Having been given Nol&#39;s leash and left alone with the gay 14 year old in a man&#39;s body. Nol&#39; had come to an understanding that Toby exploring his body is the same thing he would have done given the opportunity when he was younger. What he had planned to do with his friends today, when their turn to be the &#39;pet&#39; came up as part of their dare. As a result Nol&#39; had allowed Toby to explore his body without resistance, and the end result, while graphic and explicit had given Toby something he had been looking for.<br />
<br />
An understanding about his inner self, and with that, he wasn&#39;t going to tremble or hide in shame from his step-father Bruce anymore.<br />
<br />
So here he was, staring down Bruce in the hallway. The kind looking police officer was down and might even be dead in the other room, but Toby was not going to submit to Bruce&#39;s constant abuse, anymore.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m NOT calling you that, BRUCE.” Toby&#39;s defiance clear, but his voice wavering.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s that ya liddle shit? You think you can talk back to me like *hic a man now, huh?” Bruce taunted, swaying on the spot slightly, his eyes not leaving the smalls child&#39;s gaze. “I heard that you was with a pervert dog-person today, IN MY HOUSE!” Bruce roared as he launched forward.<br />
<br />
Toby darted to his right, though the kitchen and living room, back into the hallway behind Bruce, who had stumbled. Fallen head first into the wooden back door, breaking the frame. <br />
<br />
“I wasn&#39;t IN the house. We were playing in the backyard!” Toby yelled back, his voice clearer but still shaking, his heart pounding in his chest.<br />
<br />
In the other room, Mark&#39;s legs twitched, as he slowly started to stir, his hearing the first sense to return to him.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t care WHERE ya were.” Bruce stumbled back to his feet, blood trickling down his face.<br />
“You were alone with a fucking PERVERT!” Spit flying as he spat the words out.<br />
“I bet he made ya touch him, used those little hands and that little mouth to get his fucking jollies.”<br />
<br />
“SHUT UP!”<br />
Toby&#39;s face went red. How dare he. How dare this fat drunken bastard even think he knew anything about Toby and what happened. <br />
Toby glowered at Bruce. <br />
Toby wanted to hurt him. Even though he wasn&#39;t strong enough to do it physically, he wanted him to feel pain.<br />
Toby smirked, realizing exactly how to get under Bruce&#39;s skin.<br />
“I did touch him.” Toby said quietly but calmly. <br />
Toby stared at Bruce, thankful that his voice didn&#39;t waver, his knees didn&#39;t shake, that the ground didn&#39;t open up underneath him and swallow him whole.<br />
He felt ready.<br />
<br />
Bruce&#39;s face darkened.<br />
“What. Did. You. Say?”<br />
Bruce&#39;s chest wise starting to rise and fall rapidly, the veins on his head bulging outwards.<br />
<br />
“I did touch him.” Toby replied again, louder, clearer.<br />
“I touched him because I wanted to and I liked it.”<br />
<br />
“So yer a liddle faggot now eh?”<br />
Bruce&#39;s words dripped with the venomous hatred that had sent Toby running to hide from his leather belt many occasions past, but not today. He had a realization, and that word didn&#39;t hurt him anymore.<br />
<br />
“Yes. I&#39;m a faggot. I like dicks, I like looking at them and touching them, and licking up the yummy goo they make and there&#39;s nothing wrong with it,!” <br />
<br />
Bruce stood there, hands balled into fists, anger rolling off his form as he slowly stepped forward.<br />
“So yer a liddle faggot who takes up the arse, are ya? Should told me earlier. Could saved myself some trouble and strangled ya in yer crib, or maybe fed ya my hog. I shoulda got something outta yer worthless life before I ended it.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll never touch the dick of a fat drunk useless evil dumb ugly shit like you!” Toby screamed as he stepped backward and to his right. Bruce saw the small step and lunged, Toby barely diving out of the way in time as Bruce collided with the door frame. Toby tried to get to his feet and run, but turned to see Bruce had managed to grab the edges of his old tattered shorts.<br />
Toby wasn&#39;t ready to give in and started kicked Bruce&#39;s hand and the drunken man attempted to scramble to his feet. <br />
Toby pulled, his arms clinging  onto the front door frame, pulling with all his might, and then suddenly there was a tearing noise and Toby was running forward into the street, putting as much distance between himself and the house.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
As Toby&#39;s shorts tore apart Bruce fell backward into the room Officer Weston lay semi-conscious in. Looking briefly at the crumpled form, Bruce&#39;s eye spotted the Officer&#39;s firearm, and quickly drew it from its holster. The movement causing Mark to stir. <br />
Eyes opening with a flash Mark clambered to his feet.<br />
Stumbling to the front door as quickly as he could, feeling for his gun he realized it was gone.<br />
In front of him, Bruce was stumbling across the front yard, suddenly stopping on the street, his arms raised as he aimed down the street.<br />
Mark stumbled forward, his hands struggling to open the clasp on another item on his belt, hoping it wouldn&#39;t be too late.<br />
“DIE FAGGOT!” Bruce roared just before his hold body went rigid, collapsing onto the street convulsing.<br />
Mark, crawled to his feet again, having stumbled and fallen after firing his taser. There were several neighbors standing around watching from their windows, and as he cuffed Bruce for a second time, several came out to see if he needed any help, seeing as he was struggling to stand.<br />
<br />
Officer Weston wobbled to his car and radioed dispatch, another officer expected to arrive within minutes.<br />
Minutes that passed slowly as Mark&#39;s head slowly realigned, memories of his past flashing before him as Toby reappeared, the wide eyed boy wearing nothing but a shirt. Officer Weston knew he needed to debrief the boy, get him help after suffering so much abuse at the hands of Bruce. Mark sat there in awe at Toby&#39;s bravery, being able to do what he had never been able to while his own father was alive.<br />
<br />
Mark struggled to step back into his focused zone again, to be Officer Weston, but he was struggling, because Bruce was now cackling madly, as he stared at Toby.<br />
<br />
“It don&#39;t matter no more, Faggot! You were never a real man and now you never will be!”<br />
Bruce continued laughing with maniacal glee, as another car with two officers arrived and place Bruce in the back.<br />
“What does he mean by that?”<br />
Toby asked as he sat down next to Mark.<br />
Mark didn&#39;t know the answer to that, not straight away, but surely Officer Weston would.<br />
The pounding in Mark&#39;s temple started to fade, and he entered his low emotion state, his developed coping mechanism to analyze the situation based on fact.<br />
The facts were Bruce had assaulted an officer of the law, stolen his firearm and attempt to kill a child in his care. This happened in the early afternoon, with good lighting and multiple witnesses. The attempted victim is the perpetrators 10 year old step son, who during a verbal confrontation with his father, ended up having his shorts tear, leaving hi to flee the scene in just a shirt.<br />
<br />
Officer Weston froze. <br />
<br />
“The “nude” law.” He whispered as Toby looked down,and  realizing he was exposed covered his groin with his shirt.<br />
<br />
“ The “nude” law.” Toby parroted back as he shivered slightly. The realization that he was now an indecent slowly settling in. <br />
<br />
The two other officers stepped forward to take Toby in for processing. The small boy with tears in his eyes suddenly clinging to Mark&#39;s arm. <br />
<br />
“NO! Don&#39;t put me in that car with him!” He cried, tears starting to trickle down his face as he broke down, sobbing heavily.  <br />
<br />
Mark looked at the two officers and cocked his head, indicating they should go.<br />
<br />
He would deal with Toby.<br />
<br />
Even if he didn&#39;t know how.<br />
<br />
Toby&#39;s stomach started rumbling,  causing Mark to smile.<br />
Slowly rising to his feet, he said “Come one Toby, lets get you some food before we take you to the station.”<br />
<br />
At least he had something small and simple he could deal with first.</p>
