<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was three days later that the swim team did it. <br />
Tommy had a lot to read about the Chronivac before deciding what he would do with the swim team, but they had just given him the answer.<br />
Because they had just splashed him with something sticky and stinking that he now had the feeling he was hit by a skunk. Luckyly his laptop had been in his locker, so it was still save and functional.<br />
<br />
A couple of minutes later Tommy had his laptop and scanned the people inside the changing room of the swim team. <br />
&quot;Okay, all of them are here, perfect.&quot;<br />
With that, Tommy opened the door to the changing room. Inside all fourteen swimmers were laughing at Chris, the leader of the team, who was showing a short video of what they had done to Tommy. They all looked up from the sound of the opening door, surprised by seeing Tommy there. They had all started to change their clothes for swimming, leaving them all naked at the moment.<br />
&quot;What, not enough embarrassed for today, little kid?&quot; asked John, one of the loudmouths of the swimmers. The others laughed at that.<br />
&quot;No, it was enough. I have enough of you all and now I will get my revenge on you.&quot; Before more could happen, Tommy froze them all completely from the neck down.<br />
&quot;What have you done?&quot; asked Steve, a little bit in panic because he could not move a muscle. The others had stopped laughing and were looking angry or some slightly fearful. Chris was looking pissed. &quot;Whatever you have done, take it back or you will end beat up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the wrong move, Chris.&quot; And with that, Tommy typed away on his laptop. Shortly after that, Chris felt himself shrinking down. To stunned to say something, the others looked in horror as their leader was shrinking and turning light blue all over. His skin looked more like cotton. His arms and legs slowly vanished into his shrinking body and after that, his body vanished inside his head, the only bodypart that hasn´t shrunken down. Then his head hollowed out completely, leaving only three holes in the head. His mouth turned upwards to the opening of the body, while his eyeholes turned down as opening for the legs. Chris had been turned into a pair of briefs. <br />
Slowly, Tommy stripes down naked while going the way to the showers, taking a towel and some soap of one of the swimmers, who were still shocked by what happend to Chris and still frozen on their spots.<br />
<br />
After taking a hot shower because its freezing outside and to get the liquid from earlier of his skin and hair, Tommy come back into the changing room where the others now are pleading to him to release them or crying for help.<br />
Ignoring the noise they make, Tommy walks over to the briefs that had been Chris and put them on. Then he took his laptop and turns to the others, typing away the next changes.<br />
John and Jack, one of the other loudmouths then starts to shrink down, similar to what had happened to Chris. Like him, their arms slowly vanished into their bodies, while their legs start to fuse together, making them look like a worm of white cotton. Their heads turn upwards and sink into their bodies, closing all holes in their bodies while hollowing it out. Only the mouth is an opening when the stop shrinking, now a pair of plain white cotton socks, with being Jack the right and John the left one.<br />
&quot;Finally your big mouths are useful for something&quot; says Tommy while putting them on. The others only were pleading louder now. <br />
&quot;Its no use, the room is soundproof and the door is looked, nobody will rescue you. And before you ask, after the chances you all will be conscious to feel, hear, see and taste what you are and you will be linked to each other, so you won´t be all alone.&quot;<br />
With that, he starts to type again. &quot;What will happen to the people knowing us, like the schoolstaff or our families?&quot;<br />
Looking up from his laptop while typing away, Tommy answers:&quot; They will all forget you for now. If I change you back, they will remember, if not, then you are all none existent to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, he hits enter on his laptop. This time Peter, the strongest out of the team starts to shrink down. Like Chris before, his arms and legs starts to vanish into his body, same goes this time for the head. His body turns into white cotton and hollows out, turning his shoulders into the straps to hold him on the body while leaving holes where his head, his arms and his lower body have been. Peter has turned into an undershirt, shortly after worn by Tommy.<br />
&quot;Will you turn all of us into clothing for yourself?&quot; asks Luke, one of the sideliners.<br />
&quot;We will see&quot; was all that Tommy answers before he hits enter for the next changes.<br />
This time, two other loudmouthes, Mike and Mark as well as Tim, another sideliner start to change.<br />
Mike and Mark shrink in a similar way to Chris, their whole bodies slowly vanishing into their heads. While all of the others had changed into cotton, they both look more leathery. While their mouths turn upside and open wide, their hair turns into the shoelaces. Mike is now the left black shoe, while Mark is the right one.<br />
Tim chnaged another way. While his head and arms vanish into his body, only his feet vanished form the legs. His whole skin turns into  dark blue denim while hollowing out. Where his upperbody had been was now the upper hole of the jeans he had become. <br />
After the three chnages were finished, Tommy put them on, only to see that Tim slides down again.<br />
<br />
Fast thinking, Tommy typed in the next change, this time for Luke.<br />
Luke starts to shrink down, his arms fusing with his sides while his legs merge together, forming another worm like body. Like Mike and Mark, Lukes body looks more like leather while flattening. His mouth opens up as a belt buckle with his tongue being the holding pin. After getting some holes for the pin, Luke is now the belt to keep Tim in position. Tommy fastend the belt and put on the shoes before turning to the rest, hitting enter to the next changes to them.<br />
<br />
This time, Mitch and Steve both start to shrink down. While their lower bodies, hands and heads vanish into their bodies and they both hollow out, the rest changes different to each other. Mitchs skin turns into a white cloth T-shirt, while Steves front rips open with a zip on both sides, turning him into a dark blue jacket. <br />
Tommy then put the T-shirt on, while hanging the jacket next to his position, not needing it now.<br />
<br />
The next two to change were the last two loudmouths of the swimmers, Dan and Dustin. Their bodies changed another way then the rest. Whilw shrinking down and hollowing out, their mouths relocate to their shoulders and open up wide, while their arms, legs and heads turn into long hollow worms, changing their bodies as a whole into gloves. Dan is now the dark blue right glove while Dustin ist the left one. Tommy put them into one of the pockets in the jacket, not needing them now. Then he turns to the last two swimmers and hits enter.<br />
<br />
Harry changes in a similar war to Luke, only that he ends up as a cotton worm before flattening, making him a red scarf who ends up in another pocket of the jacket.<br />
Ben, the last one, changes similar to Chris, Mike and Mark, his whole body vanishing into his head while hollowing out. Turning into an red cotton cap that ends up in yet another pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally the swim team will not bother me again&quot; Tommy thought happily.<br />
&quot;So that you know, I can change your look at will now, limited to clothing. I can change your form, your material and your color. You are all self-cleaning and self-repairing. If I want, I can wear you forever now.&quot;<br />
With that said, Tommy left the changing room that looks now unused for months to go home.</p>
