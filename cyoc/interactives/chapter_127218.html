<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty waited with a more than a little excitement considering what he&#39;d do to to Dustin and his meathead friends tonight.  While he didn&#39;t know exactly, he was fairly sure of who would be attending tonights sleepover.  Cody, Jake, and Charlie were all on the football team with Dustin.  One of their favorite things to do when they got together was torment Ty.  To say he was looking forward to giving them a little payback would be an under statement. Ty occupied the rest of day dreaming of different things he could do to them.  June called Ty down to dinner around 6 pm that evening.  Ty hurried down to find delivered pizza on the counter with Dustin, Jake, Cody, and Charlie standing around it loading up their plates.  Ty waited quietly behind the three hulking boys, holding an empty plate.  Once the four of them had taken enough they turned and headed upstairs to Dustins room.  A quite &quot;loser&quot; slipped out of Dustin as he passed Ty making all the boys laugh.  Ty just smiled.  &quot;We&#39;re going out to eat&quot; shouted Mark as he and June headed out of the house, &quot;clean up and don&#39;t do anything stupid.&quot; This was pretty typical, Ty had never caused any real trouble but he was the one being warned.  Ty looked at the single sad piece of pizza left to him, before getting an idea.  First, he wished the kitchen was cleaned up, causing the  mess to disappear.  Then he wished for a big steak with horseradish sauce and mashed potatoes.  The plate and meal appeared Ty ate as much as he could before wishing it gone.  He could hear Dustin and his friends in Dustin&#39;s room, cheering and jeering.  Dustin came down and headed over to the bar in the living room and grabbed a bottle.  &quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Ty.  &quot;We&#39;re going to get drunk,&quot; responded Dustin matter of factly walking over to Ty, &quot;and if we get caught I&#39;ll blame it on you.&quot;  Ty cowered a little with Dustin towering over him, he instinctively lowered his gaze.  Dustin pushed passed him taking the liquor up to his room, &quot;I don&#39;t want to see or hear you tonight&quot; he shouted down the stairs.  Ty waited a moment before he wished himself invisible and raced up after Dustin slipping into his room just as the door closed.  <br />
<br />
No one heard Ty gently panting after the exertion of racing after Dustin over the cheers that Dustin&#39;s returning with alcohol brought.  Ty took the opportunity to get back to his previous hiding spot next to the desk.  Ty took the alcohol over to Cody for inspection, &quot;Sweet, whiskey is great dude&quot; Cody exclaimed opening the bottle and taking a big pull, &quot;it&#39;ll put hair on your nuts.&quot;  This made the room laugh.  They four boys passed the bottle around each taking size-able drinks.  During the second pass around, they began counting off the seconds to see who could take the biggest pull.  Jake held the lead at 7 seconds.  &quot;Guess my nuts are hairier than the rest of yours, bros&quot; Jake boasted grabbing his crotch.  This reinvigorated the contest.  Dustin was up next and managed 8 seconds of the now half empty whiskey.  Dustin immediately started bragging, &quot;who has the biggest hairiest nuts? This guy!&quot;  Ty watched as the boys got drunker and drunker trying to one up each other until the bottle was gone.  <br />
<br />
Ty was truly surprised by the lack of any substance to his step brothers conversation with his friends.  They talked about their penises a lot, about girls they&#39;ve been with and want to get with, they talk about football, but really it was all superficial.  Ty decided to start having fun. He chose Jake first.  Jake was about 5&#39; 10&quot; with black curly hair and green eyes.  Moreso than Dustin he was in great shape and was a fan of showing it off.  He took every opportunity he got to tease Ty, knock his books out of his hands, push him around.  Jake was sitting on the couch with Dustin and Charlie listening to Cody brag about how far he got with some girl in their class.  &quot;So she&#39;s laying on my bed, and unzip my pants and pull it out for her to see&quot; Cody continued, &quot;she was like holy shit thats the biggest dick I&#39;ve ever seen I don&#39;t know if my mouth can fit around it and I said only way to know is to try.&quot;  This made the boys laugh, Cody continued his story in detail.  Ty got an idea, made a wish, and just like that Cody had a huge orgasm and jizzed in his pants.  <br />
<br />
The room was silent.  &quot;Dude, did you just get off to my story?&quot; Cody asked incredulously.  &quot;No, no, no&quot; Jake stammered, &quot;that was a sneeze&quot; he tried to lie.  &quot;Uhh theres a wet spot by your dick bro&quot; Dustin chimed in.  Jake was trying to find another lie that would explain away the evidence when Cody and Charlie lunged at him pinning him down on the floor.  Dustin got up and moved slowly over towards a struggling Jake. &quot;A sneeze huh&quot; Dustin said with a smirk on his face as he kneeled down next to Jake&#39;s waist, &quot;lets just see about that.&quot;  Jake kicked and fought, yelling for Cody and Charlie to get off him or else and for Dustin not to touch him as Dustin unbuttoned Jakes pants and opened the fly exposing the mess.  &quot;Do you sneeze out of your dick, bro?&quot;  Dustin asked laughing.  The other boys strained over to look at the evidence, laughing.  Ty decided to pile on a little, and had Jake start peeing his pants.  &quot;Dude!&quot; Dustin exclaimed, &quot;what the fuck, how drunk are you?&quot; Jake struggled to figure out what was happening to him as the other three scrambled to get away from him.  &quot;I must be more fucked up than I realized&quot; Jake offered weakly.  Dustin walked towards his hamper and grabbed a towel throwing it at Jake, &quot;Clean yourself up dude.&quot;  Jake stood up his pants and shirt covered in his pee.  Ty watched him dry use it to dry off before he started to strip down.  While watching Ty considered what to do next.</p>
