<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the things Kelly hadn&#39;t factored in was the different mindset bodybuilders had to the general public. They had to be well researched in supplements and other related things. So, seeing a product advertised like this made everyone skeptical. They&#39;ve all seen products that promised things that were too good to be true. In a way, you could say the same about Muscle Tech-X.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never heard of this brand before. Is it new? It should be safe, considering they&#39;re handing it out here... Right?&quot; Cal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Remember the scandal that happened last year? Anyway, what does &#39;Instant muscular action&#39; even mean?&quot; Beau questioned. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I asked the people about the ingredients earlier, but I couldn&#39;t get a straight answer. The best I got was it had &#39;ingredients good for muscles.&#39;&quot; Bart recalled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and look at the guys selling them. They don&#39;t look like they know the first thing about fitness and bodybuilding.&quot; Clay remarked. Everyone then stared at the two interns. Both were skinny and had a nervous look in their eye. A far cry from Kelly&#39;s lackeys Hans and Tyson. Both lacked in the size and charisma they had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, if I get disqualified because this shows up in my drug test. I will...&quot; Ethan began before getting interrupted by a laugh. Everyone turned to the source to see it was Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I just found it funny that a bunch of big, strong muscle heads is acting like a bunch of pussies!&quot; All of them glared at Nick when he said that. Cal especially looked like he was going to beat Nick, but his anger subsided when he saw that Nick was approaching the stall and realized what he was planning to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you&#39;re going to drink that stuff?! Cal said in shock and astonishment. &quot;But you never seem interested in fitness and muscles and stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m still not,&quot; Nick replied while taking a cup from one of the interns. &quot;I&#39;m just doing this to show that there&#39;s nothing dangerous about this stuff, and you&#39;re all just being paranoid. &quot; There were... many holes in Nick&#39;s argument, but he wanted to prove a point. So he quickly downed the cup and held his hands out like a showman.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, nothing hap- Urk.&quot; The stoner had almost fallen over. It felt like he was kicked in the stomach. Then he looked down to see that his arm was quivering. The rest of his body soon followed suit and began quivering as well.  Nick was scared. Was he dying? When he looked up to see all his friends&#39; concerned faces, he felt fear and regret, as this might be the last time he would see them again.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Nick was not dying. Just changing. A few seconds later, he noticed that his arm was looking less stick-like, then he realized that his arms were bulking up big time. Everyone backed away and looked on in awe when they realized what was happening. The skinny stoner&#39;s body looked like it was going through months and months of workouts in just a few seconds. In fact, his upper body was growing so fast his once loose T-shirt looked painted on. However, it wasn&#39;t long before the T-shirt couldn&#39;t take the strain, and it quickly ripped to shreds.<br />
<br />
Clay realized what was going to happen and quickly jumped into action. He took off the jacket and wrapped it around Nick&#39;s waist. It was a bit awkward to do considering Nick&#39;s core and glutes were thicken with size and muscle, but it did save Nick&#39;s modesty when his skinny jeans and underwear inevitably burst. The guys then moved Nick to a less populated hallway, and not a moment too soon as Nick&#39;s skinny jeans and underwear couldn&#39;t take the strain anymore, and they ripped into shreds as well. All the stoner could do was moan as one last pulse of growth occurred, rippling like an orgasm throughout his body. Once Nick&#39;s growth subsided, Beau pulled out a spare poser he kept in his bag to Nick. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll have to do for now,&quot; Beau remarked. It was a good thing they were at a bodybuilding show, so Nick didn&#39;t look too out of place wearing something like this.  &quot;I think I have some proper clothes that will fit you, but I need to go back to the hotel to get them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once Nick put them on, it finally sunk in what just happened. He was no longer a skinny stoner working tech for the show. He now looked like an honored guest. Mirror!! He needed a mirror right now to check out the changes! But there wasn&#39;t one nearby, so Nick had to settle for just touching his muscles to examine them. Feeling his new hard curves, Nick was in bliss. He remembered how he used to make fun of his friends for working out so much, but now he got why they did. This feeling of strength and power and the way everyone was looking at him differently. It was all so amazing. He especially liked how huge and round his pecs were. And to think Nick made fun of his friends for having titts. Nick then hit bodybuilding pose after bodybuilding pose that he saw his friends do before, trying to mimic them from memory. He wasn&#39;t great at them as Bartz wanted to give him some pointers, but he stopped himself since it didn&#39;t seem like the right time to do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, this feels pretty good. I see why you guys worked out and stuff now.&quot; All of Nick&#39;s friends rolled their eyes. Of course, the guy who loudly dismissed their lifestyle was enjoying this. Maybe he was just secretly jealous of their muscles, they hypothesized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m definitely not taking this &#39;Muscle Tech-X&#39; crap. The bodybuilding committee will throw me out competition faster than-&quot; But once again before Ethan could finish his thought, he was interrupted again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hold on,&quot; an unfamiliar voice called to them. Everyone turned and found that one of the interns had followed them. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about that. Muscle Tech-X is completely undetectable by a drug test.&quot; However, in saying this, the bodybuilders got warier of Muscle Tech-X. Bodybuilding competitions were pretty harsh on cheating, so why would the Iron body show even allow something like this? The bodybuilders silently left the intern and Nick; however, the seeds of temptation were planted in their heads. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if one of them came back to get a dose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you think I could get another dose of that stuff?&quot; Nick asked the intern. Of course, that was the first thing the former twig would ask.  <br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry, only one dose per customer,&quot; the intern replied. Nick wondered if he could intimidate or force the interns to give him another dose. However, decided against it for now. After all, he was wearing only a pair of posers, and if he got bigger again. Well, he didn&#39;t want to be parading around this place naked. Also, it seems like the interns have forgotten about the Unisex clothing they were supposed to be giving out. Oh well, currently, Nick was happy with his size for now. Maybe he should get out there and explore the place and see what the show had to offer with his new muscles. Before he left, however, he turned to the intern to give him some advice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, maybe you should take some of this stuff yourself. People will trust you more. Plus, it feels really good to be like this.&quot; Nick gave the intern a flex before walking away. <br />
<br />
Perhaps that man was right, the intern thought. Maybe he and his partner should take some.</p>
