<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up early the next morning, with the overwhelming desire to go for a run. Normally the first thing you did in the morning was take a shower, but in this body you almost instinctively throw on your sweatsuit and trot out the front door. You are amazed at how effortless it is to push your body into a rigorous workout. Even though you had said to George that you were going to change back into your father, you’re greatly considering sticking around in this body. You do a couple laps around the neighborhood (if you could call it that) and jog back up the driveway about an hour later, feeling energized and ready to tackle the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
As you burst in the door, Colby and Rani look up, startled. A wide-eyed Rani dropped her spoon into her oatmeal. Colby stands up and instinctively reaches out towards his cup of coffee as something he can throw in your direction.<br />
<br />
“Oh, s…” You blurt, raising your arms. “Colby, Rani, it’s me. I used the socks last night. Sorry to scare you.”<br />
<br />
Colby sat down and grabbed his chest. “God,” he breathed. “You scared the you-know-what out of me. That’s probably not healthy for someone in my shape.”<br />
<br />
You chuckle. “Yeah. Speaking of shape, look at this,” you say, rolling up your shirt to show your rock hard stomach. “I should have done this a long time ago.”<br />
<br />
“Why change now? You were the same guy all summer,” Rani said.<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t feeling well last night. I thought I’d feel better if I changed. I did, but I still went to bed early because I wasn’t feeling great.”<br />
<br />
“Because you’re a little girl,” George said, entering the room wearing only his boxers. His gut hanging out well over the elastic band of his underwear, he grabbed a beer from the case he had bought last night, opened it, and took a big swig.<br />
<br />
Rani put her spoon down again, thoroughly unappetized. “Breakfast of champions,” she muttered. <br />
<br />
“George!” You exclaim. “Just the man I want to see.” Your voice still sounds strange to you, it’s odd being in a different body after spending so long as your father. Not that changing bodies wasn’t strange to begin with.<br />
<br />
“Look, jerkwad,” George said, pointing his finger at you. “You didn’t finish the cake last night, so our bet is off. In fact, I’m getting the socks right now and changing into something else.” George set his beer down and began to walk out of the room.<br />
<br />
“That’s fine,” you say.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I am! And you can’t stop me!” George stopped and looked back. “Wait, what?”<br />
<br />
“You can change if you want to. You’re right. I didn’t complete the dare last night.”<br />
<br />
George blinked. “Y--yeah! You didn’t!” he said, confused. <br />
<br />
“What are you guys talking about?” Colby asked.<br />
<br />
“You know that cake George bought? He dared me to eat all of it in one sitting.” You see Rani roll her eyes. “I did, but I, uh, couldn’t keep it down.” <br />
<br />
Colby shuddered and looked around. “You didn’t puke in here, did you? I’m not cleaning it.” Rani shoves her bowl of oatmeal away from her, now no longer hungry. <br />
<br />
“Nah. So, George,” you say to the large man still in his boxers. “Seeing as your challenge finished inconclusively, how about we compromise?”<br />
<br />
George cocked an eyebrow. “Compromise how?”<br />
<br />
You grin. “You’ll see. You can change however you want to today, but tomorrow, just for tomorrow, I’m going to control what you wear all day. That includes the socks.”<br />
<br />
“Ooh, this sounds like fun,” Colby commented mischievously. “Tell me more.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, tell me more,” George said. “Like, what the hell do you plan on doing to me? I see that smirk on your face.”<br />
<br />
You raise your hand. “That’s all I’m saying. I’m in charge of what you’re wearing tomorrow all day. Or you can stay a member of the Village People for two more weeks. Your choice,” you tell George, staring at him. This body is way more intimidating. “Deal?” you ask.<br />
<br />
George looked down at his gut, then slowly up at your rock-hard figure. In most cases, the choice of staying as the portly construction worker or changing to the muscled Adonis was obvious. But George was pondering what you had planned for him. You never were the kind to play practical jokes on people, but there was a first time for everything. George sighed. What was the worst you could do in a single day? “Deal,” he said. You shook hands. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said, leaving the room.<br />
<br />
“You are glowing,” Rani observed. “What do you plan on doing to that man?”<br />
<br />
“I said, you’ll see.” You leave the room to change out of your sweatsuit and to go take a shower. As you pass the bedroom you glance at George, who was looking down at his body, in the process of changing. You could only see his back; he was still fat, but now had fair brown skin and long black hair. He was changing back into the bodybuilder he was at the beginning of the summer. You shake your head with a smile and close the door to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
You wash up for a bit. After toweling off, you admire your body, especially how cool your tattoos look. “I gotta meet this guy for real,” you say to yourself. After putting on new clothes (which were a bit tight), you walk back into the kitchen to grab some breakfast. Colby looked up at you as you pull some eggs out of the fridge and find a bowl. “Whatcha making?” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Eggs,” you say. You’ve never cooked a thing before, but the body you’re in seems to know exactly what to do. Greasing up a pan, you set it on the range and begin whisking the eggs in the bowl, adding a splash of milk. “You want any?”<br />
<br />
“Nah,” Colby says, watching you. “Wait, so you could cook this whole time?”<br />
<br />
“Heck no, this guy knows how to do tons of things. We don’t have any quinoa, do we?”<br />
<br />
“What the hell is that?”<br />
<br />
“Never mind. Man, that’s going to take some getting used to. This guy wants to work out and eat healthy all the time. I ate nothing but junk food when I was my…” Colby’s eyes go wide and he frantically gestures at Rani. You look at her. She sat in the next room, frowning and scribbling something out in her notepad. She wasn’t paying attention to your conversation.<br />
<br />
You change the subject as you stir the eggs. “Man, you should see what I have planned for George. To be honest, I’m not even sure if it’s gonna work, but if it does, it’s a game changer.”<br />
<br />
“All right, what horrible thing do you have planned for George?”<br />
<br />
“I won’t spoil it.”<br />
<br />
“C’mon, you can tell me.”<br />
<br />
You look around, listening for George. “All right. I had this idea last night. I’m going to take him to The Rusty Mule, that bar down the road. Then, I’m gonna make him--”<br />
<br />
“WHOOOOO!” George ran through the kitchen wearing his boxers on his head, and nothing else. He jumps on your shoulders, rubbing his muscular body against yours. You try to swat George’s bare ass with the spatula as he runs out the door towards the lake, whooping loudly all the way.<br />
<br />
“Freakin’ perv,” you mutter.<br />
<br />
“Good thing we don’t have neighbors,” Colby said.</p>
