<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day broke. Chris opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
As consciousness gradually returned to Chris, he thought about the dream he'd just had. It was one of the most intense dreams he'd ever experienced.<br />
<br />
He looked at his clock and considered going back to sleep. That was until he turned to his left and saw Jake sleeping on his side beside Chris.<br />
<br />
Chris gasped, sat up and looked at Jake. <br />
<br />
The courage to touch Jake required a brief buildup. A smooth, soft warmth rewarded Chris' bravery. <br />
<br />
Jake was real. Chris wanted to wake Jake but decided to get out of the bed instead. <br />
<br />
Shock prevented Chris from contemplating the extra weight on his chest as he stood up. He walked into the bathroom and turned the light on before looked at the mirror.<br />
<br />
The female otter looking back at Chris almost had Chris screaming. Only Chris clamping his short muzzle silenced him.<br />
<br />
Chris ran into his parent's room to look at his reflection in their full sized mirror. <br />
<br />
A nude humanoid female otter gazed back at Chris. Light brown fur covered most of her body with cream colored fur on her chest and jaw, shoulder length black hair, green eyes, decent sized breasts (of which, despite Chris' initial concerns still looked great even with the fur) and a nice thick tail. Curiosity and innocence with a slight hint of naughtiness dominated her face.<br />
<br />
See was Chris, Chris was she. There was no sense that magic or technology had somehow teleported Chris into the body of someone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a -- I'm a girl,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
His new voice was soft. It sounded somewhat like his old voice but there was no denying that this was a girl's voice.<br />
<br />
Chris cupped his breasts with a need to confirm they were real.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how to be girl! How am I supposed to have these things?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris allowed himself to explore his nether regions with his right hand. What he found was something he'd always wanted to explore (though perhaps on a human being and not an otter person). Feeling someone exploring it however was not part of Chris' dreams. <br />
<br />
The sensation was alien and even a little embarrassing but suggested promise of pleasure Chris never knew existed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help you get used to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris looked to see Jake standing in the doorway. Jake wore a black shirt and nothing else. Chris looked Jake over. He was a bit taller then Chris and his fur was darker. Chris' eyes focused on the part of Jake that made him a he before Chris looked Jake in the eye.<br />
<br />
Relief rather then anger went through Chris. He ran over to Jake. Any worry over being a girl faded when Chris put his arms around Jake, pressed his body up to Jake's and took in Jake's sweet, musky odor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're real? This is amazing,&quot; Chris said. <br />
<br />
Jake nodded. &quot;I am indeed real. Thank you for freeing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I don't know how to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this is confusing and scary for you. Heck, I know it's probably a little creepy for you. But, I can show you that being female can be a wonderful thing. I can make you wish God had brought you into this world as the otter female you've become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that a sin if we try something? I mean, if we're not married,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Jake smiled. &quot;My faith allows for some leeway in that department.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris let go of Jake and took a few steps back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do I do now? I don't know how to be a girl! Does this mean I have to start wearing dresses and stuff?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not unless you want to,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my friends? Does this mean I can't spend time with them any more? I can still play video games right? I mean, some girls don't like video games.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you can still hang out with them! And you can definitely still play video games,&quot; Jake said. &quot;Being female should not limit who you are or what you can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded. &quot;You're right, it shouldn't, I just never thought of it from the point of view of a girl. I guess I never thought I'd become one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake put his hands on Chris' waist. &quot;And now that you have? What do you think so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris put his hands on Jake's waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me some time and I'll get back to you,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're worried that being a girl will make you weaker then worry not,&quot; Jake said. &quot;If anything, without you, I will be the weak one. You broke the spell that bound me to that form. Fate intended us to be together and it seems that it intends us to be more then just friends. How we proceed with that is indeed up to us but I believe that some force possibly beyond out understanding wanted us to be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And wanted me to be a female otter?&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Jake nodded. &quot;Yes. Oh, the things I could show you. Knowing that you're not only the person I want to be with but that you're also female, it's just...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt something poke his belly. He looked to see that Jake's manhood was betraying Jake's emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled. &quot;It's okay. I was a guy until this morning you know. I know what it's like for Mr Willy there to have a mind of his own. But, can I be a real girl for you? I wasn't born one and I still feel like a guy on the inside. Doesn't that mess things up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake shook his head. &quot;It's you that fate wanted me to be with. That fate has chosen to make your otter form female was a blessing. I know it is something you might not have requested but I know there is a reason for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded. &quot;I wonder what my friend Alex would think of me now. We've known each other for most of our lives. I'd thought that we could -- I guess that can't happen now but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I have derailed plans then I'm sorry,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe if fate didn't intend it then I guess fate didn't intend it. So, would you like to meet her? If anyone can help me with this, it's Alex. Who knows, maybe this might even make my friendship with her stronger,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would love to meet some of your friends,&quot; Jake said. &quot;But first, if it's okay with you, I'd like to take a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell just fine to me,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps but I'd like to feel the sensation of cool water against my fur. You are welcome to join me,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
Chris felt his new female parts react to the idea of it. However, he didn't want to rush into things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to test this new body out but maybe we should wait until I figure things out a bit before we do something we'll both enjoy like there's no tomorrow,&quot; Chris said. &quot;Er, that didn't sound right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake put a comforting hand on Chris' shoulder. &quot;It's all right. I understand that we should hold back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I'm not sure why we should? This is probably wrong, but right now, my body is screaming yes,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are times we should resist temptation even when we are not sure why,&quot; Jake said. He put his other hand on Chris' free shoulder. &quot;Do not worry, when we are both ready and I mean ready, I will make you the happiest otter there ever was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris gulped, nodded and showed Jake to the bathroom. Once Jake was behind a closed door, Chris went back into his room. He was about to pick up the phone to call Alex when the phone rang. A quick scan of the caller ID showed Chris that the caller was...</p>
