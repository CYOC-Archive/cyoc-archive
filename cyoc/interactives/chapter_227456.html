<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joel headed next door to the ceramics shop, coming down from the buzz of making away with stolen good. He felt something was off as he went inside to look for his mother but stopped short. It was the ointment store again. He could have sworn...<br />
<br />
He rushed back out the door, the tinge of fear taking hold of him. Though as he went through the door the tinge went into a full blown panic. As he walked out of the store.. right back /into/ the store. He was starting to freak out and turned around to bolt out the door again, but he suddenly felt a small pinch at the base of his neck and couldn&#39;t move, he just stood there frozen. He tried to shout for help but not even that would work. Then he collapsed on the ground.<br />
<br />
The old man came around to stand behind of Joel. &quot;I said we would meet again, yes?&quot; He held up a bunch of needles for Joel to see. &quot;Acupuncture. You won&#39;t move while they&#39;re on your body.&quot; The old man flipped the closed sign on the door and studied Joel for a moment. The old man pulled the jar of ointment from Joel&#39;s jacket and shook his head. &quot;Very rude to steal. If you asked I would have lowered price, but instead you steal. Lesson must be taught.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man set to work, maneuvering Joel into the store&#39;s back room. It was a long process as, while Joel was small, the man was hardly young and no longer in his prime. Next he set about removing all of Joel&#39;s clothes with an old looking knife. Then he drew out four more needles, one for each of Joel&#39;s arms and legs, before withdrawing the one at the base of his neck.<br />
<br />
The paralysis left Joel&#39;s throat in an instant, as did his sobbing pleas. His arms and legs were still locked in place, but at least now he could speak and move his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It was a little mistake. I won&#39;t ever do it again, please, just let me go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man shook his head sadly. &quot;No, I cannot. I must deal with thieves, but I am not without mercy. You&#39;ll learn to earn money and buy ointment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But.. I don&#39;t have time to work here.. I&#39;m on vacation..&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man cut Joel off. &quot;No, you will not go back to your old life for a while. You will stay here and work until you pay debts. You must be taught manners, I will be your boss and you&#39;ll obey me.&quot; The old man walked over to a table full of ointments and set to work, mixing them together in a large stone bowl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, mister..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss. You will address me as boss. And no, I will not change my mind. This is good opportunity for me too. I need strong shoulders. Deliveries, pick ups, someone to watch store. I have been doing everything by myself for so long that my body is very tired. But now I can have some rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joel went into sullen silence, looking at himself in the mirror hanging on the wall in front of him. He was scrawny, and with his clothes off his pale skin was clearly visible beyond the normal lines of his farmer&#39;s tan. He hadn&#39;t hit puberty yet, so he had no body hair, another thing for which he was embarrassed. There were kids in his class with armpit hair, and he doesn&#39;t even have his balls dropped yet. His classmates use to make fun of him saying he will never grow up and he will have a baby dick forever.<br />
<br />
The old man.. the boss, Joel corrected himself, came over with the bowl, and a large brush. The ointment in the bowl smelled of fresh herbs and exotic spices, a much more pleasant smell than he had previously experienced in this shop. Grandfather began to sing a soft song in Chinese to himself as he dipped the brush in the ointment and began to paint it on Joel. &quot;This will feel strange, but it is for your own good.&quot; As the ointment touched his skin it felt ice cold, then warmed into a comfortable heat that seemed to sink into his muscles. Once he was painted from head to toe, Grandfather set the bowl on the table and left the room.<br />
<br />
Joel had nothing but to look into the mirror, wondering what was supposed to be happening. Did he look... taller? No, it must just be a trick of the lighting, but certainly his legs weren&#39;t that long before, and his joints did ache slightly, as if he was being stretched. No.. his head was definitely closer to the top of the mirror frame. He can&#39;t believe it. That means this stuff really works? And it works fast. Not only was he getting taller, but his shoulders were broadening a bit. It looked like he was going through a growth spurt in fast forward. Everything on his body looked to be getting thicker, his skin stretching as new muscles grew beneath it, causing the skin to ripple slightly as they grew and moved. His chest had been flat before, but now he clearly has a pair of pecs. In a disturbing image his stomach seemed to ripple as it divided itself into six square muscles. Even his legs and arms were more toned. He was getting muscular and stocky, in contrast with his lean heritage. In normal circumstances, he would never be able to get a body like that. It wasn&#39;t on his DNA.<br />
<br />
His hair started to pull back into his head a few inches, until a couple inches of hair stood up from his scalp in a natural spikeyness. It naturally darkened a little, turning the dirty blond hair into something more brown like. Around his cock, dark curly hair finally spread outwards, while a thick trail was going up to his navel, he wanted body hair but maybe this was getting too much. His legs and arms grew a coating of curly hairs as well, and he can&#39;t see it but they were also sprouting around his butthole. He was a hairy fellow even more than any member of his family, but it wasn&#39;t the time to think about it. He was beginning to wonder what sort of justice this was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
A pressure in his face made him squint for a moment, but as he reopened his eyes, he noticed in the mirror that his head was also changing, his eyes doesn&#39;t look as young as before, they seemed kinda smaller. His eyebrows were thicker and his eyelashes were practically unnoticeable. His nose grew a bit as his nostrils widened. The bones of his face continued to change, his jaw becoming more square, as his cheekbones became higher and more pronounced. The baby fat melted from his face, leaving it stocky and masculine. Looking at himself in the mirror he certainly wouldn&#39;t pass as a thirteen years old anymore. In fact, he would barely pass as a teenager. His chin and lips itched for a moment as a sparse beard grew in, which kept expanding until it covered almost all his jaw. The color of his pale skin made a strong contrast with his body hair, so despite he still had a pinkish hue, he looked a few shades darker. His nipples looked very pinkish and they were even more noticeable protruding from the forest of hair around them.<br />
<br />
His cock gave a small twitch, his balls finally dropping and then swelling to a more adult size, similar to chicken eggs. His cock thickened and elongated, to a size definitely above average as his flaccid cock stopped at a proud seven and a half inches. The skin moved along the shaft, pulling back from the swelled glans where his tight foreskin can&#39;t cover it anymore and turned permanently half visible. His cock suddenly sprang to erection, growing into a thick ten inches. With a gasp, he experienced a sudden orgasm, his cock shooting his first dose of semen, then it kept going on burst after burst of cum until he felt completely drained.<br />
<br />
The old man came back into the room shortly after that. Now Joel could judge his new height at somewhere above six feet. He was scrutinized by his boss for a moment who gave him a satisfied smile and nod. &quot;Good. You have developed into a good man. Now you have strong body to work. I see you also has already experienced adult pleasure. I&#39;ll let you rest for a moment before you start working. Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joel was about to agree without thinking, before he suddenly cummed one last time. It fell on the old man&#39;s shoulder. He blushed in shame and gave him a short nod, &quot;Yes, boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you cooperate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, boss.&quot; The old man stepped over to Joel and took out the needles.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are clothes there on the chair. Get dressed and come out front to the store, I must begin teaching you. So much to teach.&quot; With that Grandfather left the room once more, leaving Joel able to move once more.<br />
<br />
He stretched his new muscles, getting used to his new body. It seemed to be brimming with energy. He picked up the clothing looking it over. An old style jockstrap and a pair of flip flops, and a white tank top and gray sweatpants. The clothes doesn&#39;t seemed clean but he got dressed without thinking too much about it, he also doesn&#39;t want to think on their size because they definitely would have been huge on his preteen body and that made him feel awkward. He gave one last look to the buff grown man looking back at him in the mirror, the clothes making him look completely the part. Then with a small sigh he went to join his new boss out front.</p>
