<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;When are you going to get to me?&quot; Dave questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're really fixated on our meeting, aren't you?&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I'm your friend,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;wouldn't that make our meeting important?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you and me,&quot; I told him, &quot;but remember, this story is to give you the background on Molly and my relationship up to now so you know the background information and can help Molly while I'm training for the Columbia Falls Police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I get that,&quot; Dave answered with a smirk, &quot;but I have to be key to your plot. Otherwise, you wouldn't be asking me to help you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only sighed, &quot;we are getting close. A little patience won't kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;YAHOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; I cheered happily at the good news of Molly getting a position that suited her education more the fighting wild animals since she was also now an &quot;animal&quot; herself.<br />
<br />
The outburst surprised Maria Fitzpatrick and the kids that were playing with Molly at the moment. They obviously didn't expect such a reaction, but after everything that Molly and I had gone through, it was the only reaction that I could give. I took Maria by her arms and proceeded to try and waltz around in circles in front of everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you,&quot; I spoke to the surprised educator.<br />
<br />
She ended up staggering away a little bit when I finally let go. Thankfully I didn't knock her over.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a rather exhilarated display for fairly small news,&quot; Maria spoke, &quot;I'm afraid Ms. Rhoer won't earn much as an aide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said sheepishly, &quot;It's just that Molly and I have had to put up with some rather tough goings and your saying you'll hire her is the latest in a string of GOOD fortunes that have finally come our way. I couldn't contain myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could see that,&quot; Maria answered with a slight chuckle, &quot;and Ms. Rhoer has already explained to me many of the difficulties the two of you have endured. It was good that the two of you did take Pierre Beauregard's offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't like him either?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's actually a good man to his family, hands, and to the ranching industry,&quot; Maria said slowly, &quot;and if he confined his activity to that he'd be fairly popular, but he's also extreme reactionary when it comes to politics... which seems to be why he wanted to hire Ms. Rhoer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither of us could see the reason in needlessly exterminating animals,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Maria answered, &quot;Hopefully, Ms. Rhoer works out over the summer, and you can avoid having to put up with Beauregard's politics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll leave you and your girlfriend to discuss a few things in private,&quot; Maria spoke, and then turned to the children, &quot;come along now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have to?&quot; a girl asked, gripping Molly's forearm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you rather watch George and I kiss?&quot; Molly quipped.<br />
<br />
The girl gave a cry of &quot;yucky&quot; and followed Maria and the other children away from where Molly and I were, giving us a little privacy. I then sat down beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we get married, George, promise me there will be no dancing at the reception,&quot; Molly opened with a tease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, it wasn't that bad,&quot; I retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;A legless chicken could dance better then you,&quot; Molly teased again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny,&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what good news do you have?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;I heard you tell Mrs. Fitzpatrick that her hiring me was part of a string of &quot;good fortunes&quot; as I heard it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
I then watched Molly pull her rounded ears forward and back, and then forward again. As she did so, I could easily see the white spot near the top of the back of her ears and the black fur surrounding the spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;These ears aren't just for show, George,&quot; Molly told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said sounding a little embarrassed, &quot;well, yes, I have good news. I made contact with the town's police chief...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He hired you too!&quot; Molly gasped with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not hired, as I still need the training, but he's said he'll help with the paperwork to put me through the academy in Kalispell if I can get him my resume and a copy of my college transcripts,&quot; I told her, &quot;once I finish training one of the officers here is due to retire, which might open the door for me to be hired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh George! I'am so happy for you!&quot; Molly gave her own cheer and pulled me into a hug, my face getting pushed against her neck, tickling my cheeks with her fur. Again I heard the low rumble like she was trying to purr, but of course, being one of the big cats, Molly couldn't purr.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, we broke the hug and began to return to more normal business.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to do to celebrate?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid I can't, George,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But's getting close to lunchtime,&quot; I protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure, but part of the deal that Mrs. Fitzpatrick offered me including me starting with her today,&quot; Molly told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;will you need me to pick you up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can walk back,&quot; Molly replied, &quot;we stuck around to let you know that I wouldn't be going back with you this afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; I gave a weak smile, &quot;then I guess I'll leave you to the kids. They don't bother you, do they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly gave a fairly distant looking smile, &quot;they do not bother me.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You danced with one of the teachers?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very badly, apparently,&quot; I chuckled, &quot;and with our missions with the police and the school finished, I left Molly to start her job as the &quot;tiger-lady&quot; and went to get some lunch for myself. And it was then that I finally met you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot; Dave cheered.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I ended up at a small sort of drive-in/fast food diner, but it was a spot to eat, and after the good fortune of Molly being hired with the school and the town's police chief being willing to help arrange for my training for the Columbia Falls PD, I was in the mood to celebrate, even if Molly wouldn't be with me. I parked near a cottonwood tree that had been planted there to provide shade and then walked over the window and looked at their menu.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your order, sir?&quot; the person manning the window asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'll have a hot-dog with only ketschup and mustard, a medium order of fries, and a medium coke,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven dollars, eighty-three cents.&quot;<br />
<br />
I dug eight dollars out of my wallet and paid for my order and waited patiently for it to be finished. Once it was, I took it to a small table nearby. I had just taken a couple of bites when I heard a new voice speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can I join you? I'm afraid they've run out of empty tables.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up to see a mousy haired man standing there with a hamburger that appeared to have chili on it as a topping with nachos as a side-dish, as well as a soda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; I answered, &quot;I don't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm David Choir, but I prefer Dave,&quot; the man introduced himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;George Wayne,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You new around here?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just move here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not formally, but things are looking that I will be moving her with my girlfriend,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need any work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little for the summer... why?&quot; I wondered why this guy was being so friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I've been setting up a vineyard and I will need some help with some of the work,&quot; Dave answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A vineyard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, to get a good grape that will grow in the mountains and will produce a very good wine,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;don't worry. I've done all the science for it, all I need is some grunt work to plant the vines and set up the watering pipes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... I'll have to tell you that I intend to go into law enforcement...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I have all the proper licenses,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;my work is completely legal, no matter what the ranchers think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying, I need to go through training, and I have a fair amount of work to do before I can even do that,&quot; I told him. I was willing to do the work to help Dave, as he appeared to be very friendly, but I knew that I would have a lot of other things that I would need to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;my hours are fairly flexible.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched as Dave began scribbling something on his napkin. He then passed it to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a call tonight,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;and we can hammer out the details.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at the number on the napkin and then put it in my pocket.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I appeared friendly?&quot; Dave interrupted, &quot;I'd like to think I'm a very friendly person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, we'd only just met, and I wasn't then, and am not now, psychic,&quot; I told him.</p>
