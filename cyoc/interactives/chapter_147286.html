<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack Aarons, a 16 yr old sophomore who just got his drivers license and a new job at the local grocery store, had recently got his third weekly paycheck and by now, the money was burning a hole in his pocket. He was working hard and wanted to treat himself to something really nice. <br />
<br />
He thought about a new game, or even a new game console but he also knew classes will be getting more difficult and need more of his time. He didn&#39;t want to blow the money on clothes he would soon grow out of or something even more temporary like a movie or food. He wanted something that would give him a lasting benefit. His eyes fell on the flyer for a new gym that opened up, the Manly Gym. It was taped to the locker next to his. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a lame name, though, this might be what I&#39;ve been looking for.&quot; Jack thought, deciding to check it out after school. he pulled the flyer down, folded it, and stuck it in his back pocket opposite his wallet.<br />
<br />
*7.5 hours later*<br />
<br />
The final bell rang and his head was swimming, Algebra 2, Chemistry, History, and Geometry is not an easy course load for the day. Jack shambled to his locker and dropped his books in place. &quot;Wait, what do I have to bring home for homework?&quot; Jack thought for a minute. &quot;We took a test, I finished those problems in class, I can write that up before class tomorrow morning, and I already know the material! Awesome. I&#39;m free!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jack slammed the locker shut and as he was about to twist the combination lock a heavy guilty feeling washed over him... &quot;Fine! I&#39;ll do it now.&quot; Jack pulled out the history homework and took 20 minutes to do it instead of the 5 minutes he would have left himself to complete it. <br />
<br />
Successfully avoiding guilt he got to his car (his parents&#39; car) and didn&#39;t know what to do. He doesn&#39;t want to go home just yet, he has money and is off work tonight and tomorrow night, but has to work the rest of the week and the weekend. its 3:30 in the afternoon and this is practically his vacation time! <br />
<br />
With a sudden feeling of desperation his mind began to race, Game store? No. Movie? No. Food? Mom would kill me if I missed dinner. Then he remembered the flyer.<br />
<br />
* 20 minutes later *<br />
<br />
Jack pulled up to the recently refurbished department store. This strip mall had been dead for years, Jack only had the faintest memory of the store when he was 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Entering, the open floor plan of the former department store was gone and walls had been erected though up beat music permeated the lobby. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; An athletic looking man in his mid 20s asked.<br />
&quot;Umm, i&#39;m thinking about joining.&quot; Jack replied feeling out of place.<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; the man beamed, &quot;Let me just call someone to give you a tour, it will be just a minute or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
As promised,  a very lean and muscular man in his thirties appeared introducing himself as Hank. He looked like he was a personal trainer or action movie star. After signing liability releases, Jack was shown the different amenities. such as  the racket ball room. sauna, the various machines, locker room, workout room where classes are held and so on. Jack was even allowed to sit on few of the machines and try them out. <br />
<br />
All around him were lean muscular guys in their mid 20s all the way up to 50s+. Jack being a fairly scrawny 16 year old was a little self conscious when he got on the machine, it felt like the whole gym was staring at him, though that had to be just in his head. &quot;Do you have any other teenagers enrolled? I kinda feel like I don&#39;t quite fit in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something tells me you&#39;ll fit right in as soon as you join, but to answer your question, yes we had another young man join last week and we are advertising discounts at the local schools. I&#39;m sure this place will be brimming with others your age in no time at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon concluding the tour Hank turned to Jack and asked, &quot;Why would you want to join? Why did you come in here today?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jack stammered, entirely unprepared for the question. &quot;Um, well I just got a job and my license and I wanted something nicer that would last, I didn&#39;t want to waste it on small things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank pondered for a moment picking just the right words, &quot;Jack, joining this gym is an investment into your future. You&#39;ve undoubtedly noticed all the men in here are pretty sizable, and I have no doubts that you can be just like them. but you will have to commit several years to achieve those results. On the other hand, I&#39;m sure it will take just a few days for you to start fitting in and we&#39;d love to see you grow into a handsome young man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thank you Hank.&quot; Jack mumbled unsure of how to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider carefully what you are willing to give up. Time is the biggest investment the gym takes. Come back tomorrow if you&#39;re ready for a new, stronger you.&quot; With that Hank turned and walked away.<br />
<br />
Jack didn&#39;t know what he was expecting, but it wasn&#39;t that. Usually sales people push and then push harder. He was almost shoved out the door and told to reconsider if this is what he wants. Now nearly 5 he headed home to do chores and play some video games after dinner.</p>
