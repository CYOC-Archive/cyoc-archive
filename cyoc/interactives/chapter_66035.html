<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Feeling David's hot breath on the nape of your neck, you felt something deep within 
you stir. He was giving you the opportunity to be something that should have only existed 
in horror stories and fairy-tales, but clearly existed regardless of anything you have been 
taught. Thinking that he didn't get his point across earlier and still being riled up, David 
leaned against the top edge of the sofa and licked your neck sensually, going up to your 
ear lobe, toying with it using the tip of his tongue.</Br>
<Br>You could not believe how much that increased your heart beat, sending chills of 
erotic pleasure through your body. Catching this, David grinned and still at your ear, he 
asked you again.</Br>
<Br>"So... do you want to feel the way I do? To feel <Strong>strong</Strong> in every 
part of your body?" David asks, breathing heavily on your ear and neck while your hairs 
stood on end.</Br>
<Br>You just sat there, not knowing what to do or say, feeling the bulge in your pants 
raging stronger than anything you had ever felt. A part of you wanted what he was 
offering, but another part of you was scared to become the beast that you knew resided 
deep down within yourself.</Br>
<Br>"I... I don't know..." you say, trailing off in your words, not wanting to really answer 
the question.</Br>
<Br>As you spoke, David looked down to see how big of a tent you were sporting, despite 
trying to fight the sexual urges you were feeling. Sensing that there was something about 
you that you weren't being honest about, even with yourself, David knew that there was 
going to be a slight battle in winning you over to his side.</Br>
<Br>"What is it... hmm? Why don't you know what you want to do?" David asked as he 
walked around the sofa to stand directly in front of you.</Br>
<Br>You tried not to look, but it was hard to, as his thick piece of meat stood straight out 
of his shredded pants, throbbing with every beat of his heart, dripping drop after drop of 
thick and stringy precum.</Br>
<Br>"I just don't think I could live my life with a huge secret like you have..." You say, 
thinking you may be able to get out of actually answering him after all.</Br>
<Br>"Oh... is that so?" David said with a sly grin, enjoying that he got the opening he 
needed to figure out what you were holding back... even from yourself. "So... you mean to 
tell me that you don't already live your life, keeping a huge secret that have unwanted 
implications like my own?"</Br>
<Br>"I... I don't know what you mean!" You say, unsure of where David was going with this 
and not really liking it either.</Br>
<Br>"Oh come on man... I know there is something you aren't being honest about. Hell... I 
can smell it on you. You say you aren't gay, but I can see how my huge boner is making 
you salivate more. I can even smell how aroused you are, just by me standing here, cock 
out and ready to go. You cannot tell me that deep, down within you, there is something 
begging to get a taste of my man meat and the juices my cock is producing! Hell... if I were 
in your shoes, I'd be wanting to get rid of a pesky problem that is downstairs!" David said 
with some coyness, playing on everything that he could sense that you were feeling.</Br>
<Br>"I... I don't..." You started to say, but stopped as David planted a small kiss on your 
lips.</Br>
<Br>At the sensual touch of his lips to yours, you could feel your body melt and whatever 
was in you holding back, gave way and you could feel yourself wanting to do more with 
him. At that moment, there was one question at the back of your mind, which was 
<Em>I'm not gay... am I?</Em> Everything in you, up until that point, said no. Now... you 
weren't really sure of anything and the world you thought you knew was being turned 
upside down. As David backed away with a big smile on his face, his slight fangs showing 
and all, you could feel something in you want more, but you still tried to fight it.</Br>
<Br>"Man... for someone who isn't gay, it sure felt like you didn't want that slight kiss to 
end. I gotta tell you too, that was a great kiss!" David said, slowly weaving his web to lure 
you in more.</Br>
<Br>David knew that you were gay, even though you kept saying that you weren't. 
Everything about you gave him indication that you wanted more, so... David decided that 
he needed to play on that and get you to open yourself up about your <Em>true</Em> 
self. Already standing there close to you, David went to stand back up, but lost his balance 
and stumbled a bit. Trying to stop himself from falling, he brushed his hand against your 
very rigid cock, which sent a wave of pleasure over you.</Br>
<Br>"Well... something about you is saying give me more." David said with a coy grin.
</Br>
<Br>"I... I can't help it... there is something going on that I don't feel comfortable about..." 
you said, trailing off, trying to fight back the feelings you were having toward David.</Br>
<Br>For all intensive purposes, you knew he was right. Something in you said that you 
were gay. It has been telling you this for years even though you always denied and fought 
against it. Ever since you were a teenager, going through puberty, life changed for you. 
Instead of liking girls, which you did in the very beginning, you became sexually curious 
about being with someone of the same sex. Watching pornos, you found yourself wanting 
to see only the men and even watch men on men pornos instead of the all too common girl 
on girl ones that were on at least once a night. Up until this point, you had never been with 
another man. You were not a virgin since you had several girlfriends and even had sex with 
a few of them. Even then, you felt that what you were doing was wrong, that it was not 
right and did not fit with how you felt. This <Em>being gay</Em> was something you 
buried deep within yourself, something that took you years to do, all was erased by his 
presence and especially that kiss.</Br>
<Br>"Come on buddy, I know you want to fool around with me! Everything going on with 
your body says so. I can even smell the precum that you have been leaking for a while 
now... which tells me that you have been excited for quite some time. Go ahead man, there 
is nothing wrong with being who you are and I sure as hell wouldn't mind if I was that male 
who you tried things with for the first time. I also wouldn't mind those nice lips of yours 
around my cock, suckling on it like a nursing babe, enjoying it and becoming the 
<Strong>real</Strong> you." David says, standing over you, his thick sausage inches 
away from your mouth.</Br>
<Br>Internally knowing that he was right, you could feel your mouth water over the huge 
shaft and mushroom head that was just hanging there, waiting for you to try. Wanting to 
just get over it, you start to reach out to just feel his shaft. Even though you were dying to 
dive on it and just suck him off, you thought it was best to take baby steps.</Br>
<Br>"Yeah man... go ahead and give it a touch, hell stroke it a bit if you want to! I 
understand wanting to take baby steps, which is fine by me... it is all a part of becoming 
who I know you know is inside of you. I can tell that you are gay through and through, but 
you have been lying to yourself because of the negative stigma that is on being 
homosexual. It's ok man... be who you are and enjoy it!" David said encouragingly, feeding 
you strength to get over whatever is keeping you from being who you are.</Br>
<Br>As you reach out, you graze his cock head that was slick with his sticky and stringy 
pre, eliciting a moan out of him... one that sounded both human and bestial. Covering your 
hand in the thick and somewhat clear liquid, you pull back still not feeling right about what 
you were doing, even though it felt more normal for you than being with the few women 
you have been with in the past. You look at your hand that was completely coated in the 
liquid, inspecting it, wondering what the stuff tasted like. As you stared at the stuff, David 
remained silent and you found yourself seriously contemplating bringing the fluid to your 
mouth. Something in you was dying to see what the stuff tasted like and to understand 
why a lot of girls enjoyed swallowing the liquids a cock produces. Curiously, you bring your 
hand to your lips and smear just a bit of it on your lips, which left a thick string between 
your digit and your lip. Liking how slick the fluid felt on both parts of you, you stick your 
tongue out and lick it up in one fall swoop. As soon as the stuff hit your tongue, your eyes 
lit up like the Fourth of July with a burst of intense flavor, tasting and enjoying the sweet 
liquid that was still on your hand. Wanting more, you bring your hand to your mouth, 
suckling on your fingers and hungrily consumed every drop that was there.</Br>
<Br>Watching you, David smiled, his fangs increased in length slightly while wanting to 
cheer you on. "Yeah! That's it, enjoy everything that I am and everything that you are!"
</Br>
<Br>You just smile as you finish cleaning your hand off, finding yourself wanting more... 
hell <Strong>craving</Strong> more! Knowing where the stuff came from, you grab David 
from behind and pulled him closer to you, aiming his cock for your mouth. You didn't 
know if you wanted his whole piece of meat in your mouth just yet, but you sure as hell 
wanted to taste the liquid from the tap, pure and untainted by whatever could have been 
on your hand. With his cock head resting against your lips, you pushed your lips onto his 
cock head, letting just the thick mushroom head into your mouth and feeling the thick 
nectar drip directly onto your tongue. Doing so, David moaned in pleasure, both from his 
cock being in your mouth slightly and his werewolf side starting to come out.</Br>
<Br>As you nursed on his cock head, you felt overwhelmed with how you felt, enjoying it a 
lot more than you thought you would. To you, it was almost like having a Kielbasa sausage 
in your mouth that was filled with a creamy cheese like liquid that started oozing out 
because there was too much in the sausage to contain it all. Feeling how right it felt to you, 
you decide to see what it was like to have the whole thing in your mouth. Slowly you drive 
your head down his average length, but very thick shaft, feeling his cock twitch in your 
mouth and being rewarded with a thick gob of pre that landed on your tongue and slid 
down into your throat. You could not believe how good it felt, feeling him react like that to 
you and knowing without a shadow of doubt that you were doing your job well. Sliding 
slowly on the length of his shaft, you could feel it thicken slightly, and look up to see him 
going through his transformation slightly. His muscles were back to being their full size; 
his body hair was increasing; his ears grew to ovalish points and his hands were thickening 
while his claws grew out slightly. This was just further confirmation that you were doing a 
great job, which unlike with a woman, you could never tell if they were really being 
pleasured or if they were faking. Reflecting on this, you found yourself reviling what you 
did with a woman and started disliking being with one even more because of how you 
never knew if they were faking it or not. At least with a guy, you knew whether you were 
doing a good job or not.</Br>
<Br>While you slowly worked on his cock, you could feel the skin start to tense up and his 
balls drawing closer to releasing whatever load was in them. A part of you wanted it as a 
reward, but a part of you was unsure of going further because you had no idea if you 
would like it or not. You knew that there was no way to be sure unless you tried it at least 
once, just like sucking a cock, but it was still something you didn't know if you could 
completely commit to.</Br>
<Br>Being halfway transformed into his werewolf form, David looked down at you and 
rubbed your head gently, being cautious not to scratch you incase you didn't want to be 
like him. Although, David knew that just by ingesting his pre, part of you was more like 
him. That bestial nature was at the forefront of your mind, which he could tell from how 
much you let yourself go, enjoying nursing on his thick sausage. David even knew that you 
were already closer to being a werewolf than you knew because the physical changes he 
could see in you. Your body was now toned with a slight bit of muscle build instead of 
average; your facial hair already grew out to a thin shadow where you had been smooth 
shaven moments ago; your body hair even grew more, making you look more like a man 
than what you looked like earlier. David wanted you to be like him and he knew that you 
weren't just because your ears didn't come to even a slight point. That was something 
David knew he had to hide, he could never truly lose the tip to his ears. Anytime that he 
was asked about it, he simply stated that he was born like that and it was a mutation, just 
like any other mutation that made each and every person different from one another. David 
was definitely a guy that lived his life and didn't hide anything about it, other than the fact 
that he was a werewolf. Obviously with you, he didn't think he had to because of your 
affinity with his kind.</Br>
<Br>Quickly coming to the point where he was going to release his wad into your 
obviously hungry mouth, David stopped you from continuing, even though he didn't want 
to stop the incredible amount of pleasure he was getting from you. David knew that if you 
both continued, you would have a life that you may not have wanted. He was aware that if 
you swallowed his seed, you wouldn't become a total werewolf, but you would become one 
partially. Basically, instead of transforming, you would go back and forth from being a 
normal, average looking guy to how you were now, but always having a hunger to pleasure 
him and swallowing every creamy drop of his delicious spooge.</Br>
<Br>"Alright bud, it is time for you to make a decision because I really didn't even want 
you to stop what you were doing! I have to say, your blow job is incredible and the best 
that I have had in a very long time! You need to decide if you want to be like me or just 
quit right here and now. No matter what you choose, I will understand, but if you do 
choose to quit... I really would like you to finish me off with a hand job instead or finish the 
blowjob, because no matter what you do... you are partially going to be like me, but you 
will also be like a sex slave. If you decide to become like me, you won't be bound to being 
with me sexually, it will be a choice. If you don't... well you will always want to be with me 
and perform sexual favors for me. So, it really is a choice, even though it may not seem to 
be much of one at all." David said in his slightly deeper voice from being halfway through 
his transformation.</Br>
<Br>Looking up at the guy you have been pleasuring since the first reprieve, you decide 
to...</Br></p>
