<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look at Skylar’s eyes, they’re looking behind you, like someone was there. You can take a pretty good guess as to who’s there, but you turn around regardless.<br />
Lo and behold, you see the duo of doom, Bella and Cara.<br />
“Great,” you said to yourself, knowing this isn’t going to go how you want it to considering you don’t have the ring anymore and Skylar is essentially unable to speak without causing some kind of trouble.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, you’re still here,” Bella says, crossing her arms, “I guess queen annoying sister decided to— OW!” Bella says, suddenly interrupted by Cara kicking her leg, she turns to face her, “don’t pretend like you like her,” Bella says to Cara, but realises that she’s looking at something else. Bella looks forward and realises that Skylar was right there, “S-Skylar…” she says, almost a little intimidated, “what’re you…” she pauses, noticing Skylar’s particularly broad hips and huge butt, “w-wha…” Bella tries to speak but is unable to.<br />
<br />
Skylar looks at you, you don’t know what to do, you can’t fix the situation and neither can she,<br />
“What the hell happened to you!?” Cara yells, pointing at Skylar’s hips. Skylar blushes a little, feeling very awkward at her ‘friends’ finding her in the state she’s in,<br />
“And why the hell are you hanging out with this loser?” Bella says, giving you a look. You look back at her, ignoring her pointless comment.<br />
<br />
You all stand there, staring at each other in shared awkwardness. Bella impatiently breaks the silence,<br />
“Skylar!” She shouts, demanding an answer, “why are you ignoring us! Explain why you’re hanging out with HIM and why the hell you have an ass the size of a dump-truck!”<br />
Unable to answer, Skylar feels a sudden urge to answer without words…<br />
“…twice the size of Bella.”<br />
<br />
This was going to be good.<br />
<br />
You look at Skylar with a huge smirk on her face, then back to Bella and Cara,<br />
“What?” Cara says, puzzled, then her eyes widen as she notices Skylar’s body growing… really growing. Bella noticed it too, not saying a word as she’s filled with Horror as Skylar’s body was pulsing through a number of stages.<br />
Her height was increasing rapidly, becoming bigger and bigger as the seconds passed. Her ass grew a little too, not too much, especially when compared to her breasts. Her breasts were growing at a very fast pace, surpassing Bella’s breasts quickly, leaving her absolutely speechless.<br />
As she continued to grown, she reached Bella’s exact height, surpassing it with a smirk on her face. She began to tower over her, her body growing more and more, even her breasts getting even bigger.<br />
But the end, Skylar wasn’t just taller, in fact if she were at regular size, she’d be around Bella’s height. But her height wasn’t the only thing that increased, her entire body had increased as well, leaving her twice the size of a regular person. Her breasts were twice the size of Bella’s, exactly how she wanted it.<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK!!” Cara yelled, grabbing Bella by the arm and trying to run off, but she lost grip of Bella’s arm because Bella didn’t move with her, she stayed completely frozen. She was in shock.<br />
Cara fell backwards as she lost grip of Bella’s arm, landing on her ass, “shit my dress!” She said to herself. Skylar chuckled, looking down on her, she laughed even harder. She pushed Bella out of the way, making her fall over too, which also broke her trance.<br />
Skylar bent down and grabbed Cara by her waist, picking her up like a doll, “PUT ME DOWN!! PLEASE DON’T EAT ME!!” She cried dramatically, making people in the mall look at her, suddenly there were screams all around as people began running away,<br />
“Of course you’d get all the attention on us,” Skylar said, sighing at the end, “I wish everyone in the mall, excluding us four… and Tonya I guess, completely ignore us,”<br />
“T-Tonya…” Cara said, frantically turning her head, “WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER!?” She screamed. Even you couldn’t help but cringe at her lack of awareness, she was a real bimbo without even wishing it,<br />
“Will you shut up!” Skylar shouted, garnering no reaction from the mall, aside from Bella.<br />
<br />
Charging at Skylar, Bella punched at Skylar’s leg. Skylar, like a regular human would, felt the pain. She wasn’t knocked down, but she was definitely pissed off,<br />
“You bitch!” She yelled, stepping backwards.<br />
You took initiative and grabbed Bella, restraining her. You knew she could be pretty strong, but she really was revisiting you pretty well,<br />
“Get off me you creep!” She shouted, getting her arm free and managing to slap you around the face. You really felt it, she took a good swing at you,<br />
“Ow!” You said involuntarily. Skylar looked beyond pissed off now,<br />
“HEY!” Skylar screeched. She dropped Cara from her grasp as she turned to grab Bella.<br />
<br />
Despite your not-so-great opinion on Cara, she was falling pretty far, and considering her lack of awareness, you didn’t want to risk finding out about her lack of balance. You quickly rushed over and caught Cara as she fell.<br />
She looked you in the eyes as you held her in your arms, she stared at you, wondering if after all this time… you were meant for her…<br />
You dropped her and ran back to Skylar’s aid… obviously.<br />
<br />
Skylar had cornered Bella, both full of emotions. You knew Skylar’s emotions, and right now they were nothing but anger. You ran in front of her and yelled, “SKYLAR!” You started, “LISTEN TO ME!” You waved, getting attention. She looked down at you, still filled with anger, “remember how angry you get when you get too big!” You say, recalling the various instances that Skylar has gotten too large, and subsequently gotten too angry… one time trying to destroy the town… something you agreed to not talk about.<br />
<br />
Skylar looked at herself, then back to you. She looked like she had acknowledged that she was in fact too large, and was likely going to wish herself back to a manageable size, but she looked back at Bella, “you’re not going anywhere,” she says, with a calmer, but still rage-filled expression, she said, “I wish Bella’s boobs are so big that she can’t move,”<br />
“WHAT!?” Bella shouted, looking at her breasts. Within seconds, she could feel something in her chest. Her already pretty decent chest was growing, getting tighter in her top. Eventually, she burst through the top, leaving her bare breasts to keep growing. She ran away from you and Skylar and tried to grab Cara, but as she reached her, she lost her balance due to the increasing size and weight of her breasts. She eventually fell over, landing on her breasts, which continued to expand onto the ground in a pool of boobs. She was unable to lift herself up due to the size of her breasts.<br />
<br />
You and Skylar looked at each other as Skylar wished herself back to her original size, but deciding to keep her ass of course… it didn’t surprise you that she liked it so much. To make her feel better after her outburst, you gave her a big, long embrace. She was definitely more calm.<br />
You looked over and saw Bella on the ground, pinned down by her obscenely large breasts on the ground. You and Skylar chuckled at her,<br />
“Well well, you got her answer,” Skylar said, approaching Bella,<br />
“Yeah I got it when you turned into a giant monster!!” She shouted back, “now make my boobs back to normal and fix my top!” She demanded, then timidly adding, “please…”<br />
<br />
Skylar hadn’t noticed, but you realised that Cara was completely gone. She must’ve managed to run away as you were consoling Skylar. To your annoyance, you didn’t have the ring so you couldn’t simply wish her to return. Lucky for you, it didn’t seem like you needed to.<br />
A voice from behind said,<br />
“Looking for her?”</p>
