<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Louis and Maddy hated each other. With a passion.<br />
<br />
Louis was in college, home for the holidays and having to share the family house with his sister, Maddy. Their parents, Mark and Jack were out on a vacation they’d been planning for over a year now, so there was no avoiding. Although Maddy was eighteen as of two months ago, they didn’t trust her to keep the house in one piece while they were gone, so Louis was instructed to ‘look after her’. In more realistic terms, he was asked to ‘look out for her’.<br />
Maddy was trouble. She loved sneaking out and had recently picked up a habit of shoplifting. She was never trustworthy, unless you were her friends. Despite managing to keep herself from ever getting caught, if a friend of hers was in some kind of trouble, she’d stand up for them. In some cases she’d receive a black eye for this.<br />
For years, Louis was the only person Maddy ever feared. The only person that could tell her to do something and she’d just do it. But after all this time away at college, Maddy seemed to have overcome this one weakness.<br />
<br />
“Maddy for god’s sake, take the trash out!” Louis called down the hall,<br />
“You do it!” She yelled from the couch,<br />
“I’m doing the dishes!” Louis yelled back,<br />
“Whatever…” Maddy replied, not loud enough to hear, but Louis had learned to listen for this. He sighed, mumbling to himself, “only five more days…” he groaned, “five more days…”<br />
<br />
“What’s this game in your bag!?” Maddy yelled out, clearly moving his stuff around,<br />
“Leave my shit alone!” He yelled back,<br />
“Too late. What is it?” Maddy asked again,<br />
“I-it’s… I don’t even know,” he said. He took a deep breath, switched off the faucet and made his way into the living room.<br />
Instead of simply observing whatever she’d found, she’d gone and opened it and spread it all over the coffee table. It seemed to just be a bunch of blank playing cards. He looked at it for a moment, trying to figure out what it was,<br />
“Why can’t you just leave my stuff alone…” he groaned. Then it hit him, “OH right!” He said to himself, “it’s a card-game a friend told me to play with my girlfriend,”<br />
“GIRLFRIEND!?” Maddy jumped up, pointing her finger at her brother,<br />
“SHIT!” Louis said, facepalming himself, “y-you can’t tell anyone!”<br />
“I’m gonna tell everyone!” Maddy said, reaching for her phone,<br />
“NO!” Louis yelled. He grabbed her arm, but she immediately swung him over. He stepped over the coffee table, still having his sisters arm in his grasp,<br />
“Get off me, creep!” She yelled as she yanked him to one side. It caused her to trip over the coffee table, making Louis fall over as well.<br />
<br />
The two of then on the ground beside one-another. They groaned as they both made eye contact… but then.<br />
<br />
SLIP<br />
<br />
Four cards flew right from the deck and appeared in pairs right in front of them<br />
“Uhm…” they both said,<br />
“I think… these might be the change cards,” Maddy said,<br />
“The what cards?” Louis asked,<br />
“I don’t know, it was engraved on the side of the box,” she explained,<br />
“Bullshit,” Louis said. He stood up, walking past his cards to look at the box, “I swear to god if this thing is…”<br />
“What the hell does this even mean!?” Maddy yelled out. Louis looked back to see Maddy looking at one of the cards,<br />
“What does it say?”<br />
“‘Bikini’s and Bathing Suits’,”<br />
“What?” Louis replied,<br />
“What kind of game is this…” Maddy said. She looked at her other cards, “ugh, that’s just rude,”<br />
<br />
Louis looked at the box, but no such engraving appeared, “you dick, there’s nothing on here,” he said,<br />
“What?” Maddy replied, “I swear it said ‘Each Player Pick Up Two Change Cards’ on the side,”<br />
“Since when was your memory…” Louis started, but as he looked over at his sister, his eyes went wide with shock, “ehm…”<br />
“My memory was always good,” Maddy explained, unaware of what was going on. As she blabbered about her amazing memory, she failed to notice that her clothes were reducing. Her tank top retreating in on itself, becoming more akin to a bikini top. The same applied for her shorts. Then it hit Louis, “oh god the card,” he said, “Madeline what did your other card say!?”<br />
“Don’t call me Madeline, I’ve told you this at least a-hundred times,”<br />
“MADDY!” He yelled,<br />
“Piggy Tail!” She blurted out. Clearly Louis still had some authority over her.<br />
“Oh dear,” he said,<br />
“What?” She asked, looking down, “HOLY SHIT!” She yelled, finding that her tank top and shorts, bra and underwear had all be replaced by a rather tight and revealing bikini set, “WHAT THE HELL DID YOU— oop!” She jumped as she put her hand on her butt. She felt something… something just above her butt,<br />
“Don’t tell me you have…”<br />
“GET IT OFF!” Maddy screamed as she spun around, jumping up and down in some useless attempt to get rid of the tiny pigs tail she’d grown.<br />
<br />
Louis didn’t know what to do… until he looked down and discovered that his cards had slid all the way to his feet,<br />
“Hell no,” he said, turning the other way, ready to leave as quickly as possible. But out of the corner of his eye… he saw the box change,<br />
‘Failure to Participate will Result in Penalty’<br />
Unsure of what else to do, Louis turned around and picked up his cards. He carefully turned them over at the same time,<br />
“What do they say!?” Maddy yelled, “is it over yet!?” She said in a very panicked state,<br />
“N-no… they say ‘Stubbly Face’ and…” he hesitated.<br />
<br />
His clean-shaven face suddenly grew just the tiniest amount of stubble. It was enough to be noticeable, but not too bad to completely piss Louis off. Although his concern wasn’t that card,<br />
“What does the other one say!?” Maddy yelled out, more focussed on her brother than her new tail.<br />
Louis just stood there as Maddy watched. She looked down, particularly at his legs… they were getting thicker. She looked up at his reasonably un-flat belly as it started to bloat more and more. His arms, his face. Through his tight t-shirt she even watched as he developed a pair of flabby man-boobs. He wasn’t fat, but…<br />
“Chubby,” he said, “m-my card said Chubby,” he finished.<br />
<br />
“We can stop,” Maddy said, “we can’t actually play this,”<br />
“We have to,” Louis said, “it warned me about walking away… it’ll punish us,” he explained, “plus, you can’t live the rest of your life with a pig tail, and I can’t just suddenly become… chubby,”<br />
“Then how the hell do we even play!?”<br />
“I-I guess… I guess we ask,” Louis said.<br />
The two looked at the box, terrified. They looked at each other then back at the box.<br />
<br />
They had no idea what they were expecting…</p>
