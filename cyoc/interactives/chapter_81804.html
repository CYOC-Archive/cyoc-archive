<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It gives me an idea and with a smirk on my face I start to figure out how the machine works.<br />
I press some buttons, just to see what happens, and set the timer for an hour, which is the minimum amount of <br />
time the chronivac allows your tranformation to take after completion. <br />
I then choose how much I want to change, which I set to 50%, with adding information that I wish mostly my <br />
legs and my arms to change and the rest of my body a little less. I check the box for keeping human definition <br />
and then smile at Ricardo as I got out of my clothes and stood naked in front of my friends<br />
<br />
You better keep your hands off of me man. And then I push the button.<br />
In a blink of an eye I see I accidentally changed the duration from and hour to a week.But then I see I made a <br />
huge mistake.<br />
Oh fuck, it was supposed to be an hour...<br />
and then it was too late.<br />
I felt my body tingling all over. I started to change. my insides started to twist and turn and slowly solify. <br />
I felt how my skin became a bit more rough and smooth and all my hair fell out. I couldn't move my arms and <br />
legs anymore, my legs growing together and my arms growing to my side. My back started hollowing out and my <br />
front pushing a bit outward. I could hear Bart yell out that I was an idiot to become a banana for a week. I <br />
wanted to say it wasn't intentional, but all my friends got up as they saw my body change into a banana of 6 <br />
foot tall. My skin started to turn a greenish yellow as I tipped over and fell forward, rocking a couple of <br />
times on the floor. feeling how my stiff cock was pressed to my lower belly and grew to it right away. I then <br />
fell to my side and lay still. I was a huge banana now, Bart even said the room started to smell of banana. <br />
they said my muscle definition was still there. my pecs stood out nicely, but I had no nipples. my shoulders <br />
were gone, my neck was side to shape my upper body to that of a banana. my abdominal muscles were rock hard <br />
and the 8 pack I had was very visible, so were my back muscles and my ass. my legs and arms had their <br />
definition, but they looked like they were drawn on my new body, as I was entirely in the shape of a banana.<br />
I felt my body shrink and when I was just the size of a banana a ding was heard. Transformation complete. 50% <br />
banana with human features. Duration 1 week, starting when transported to specified location. Searching for <br />
appropriate specified location.<br />
My heart, if I still had one, skipped a beat. Oh shit I forgot to turn that off. no, please no don't send me <br />
to a supermarket or anything, I thought.<br />
The guys tried to grab me, but before they could the machine said 'specified location found. transportation <br />
starts now.' <br />
A flash and then I was gone. I landed hard, in what I soon found out to be a fruitbowl. I was surrounded by <br />
apples, banana's, some oranges, a kiwi and some grapes.<br />
Damn this person sure loves his fruit. A shock then came over me as I managed to look over the edge. Shit. <br />
This is Ricardo's kitchen.<br />
I wanted to cry out, but knew I couldn't do anything. I would be a banana for a week and I was in the kitchen <br />
of the worlds hugriest man. <br />
<br />
I just had to lay there in the dark, waiting for what was to come. it took a few hours before the lights went <br />
on and I could hear Ricardo and Peter walk into the room. I could hear them talk about their seach for me. <br />
Ricardo said he hated they lost me, I looked delicious and he really wanted a banana then, but he was glad he <br />
got to eat the chicken later. Peter grinned. You are just so lucky none of the other guys saw you forced Bart <br />
to change into one, and he looked damn tasty, even being half a chicken.<br />
I gulped. Ricardo ate Bart? I am so doomed right now.<br />
Peter and Ricardo kissed. Another shock, cause I had never expected them to be gay. Peter was so hot in his <br />
tall slender swimmersbody. Ricardo was quite muscled and looked just as amazing. they made hot couple. The <br />
lights went off and they went to bed.<br />
<br />
The next day I was woken up by sounds from the kitchen. I couldn't see what was happening but Peter seemed to <br />
make one of his famous smoothies. I gulped, knowing he always threw in a few banana's. Just seconds later a <br />
hand grabbed a few banana's and looked at them. <br />
Nope, this isn't Erik. Nope this isn't Erik as well. I could hear the sounds of the banana's being pulverized <br />
inside the blender, together with other fruits and yoghurt. <br />
then I felt a hand on my body and suddenly I was lifted up in the air.<br />
Three banana's should do today. And nope this isn't ....<br />
Oh holy fuck<br />
This is Erik<br />
Oh my god, and you are even more yellow than Yesterday.<br />
Ricardo, come here, I've found Erik<br />
Ricardo came running into the kitchen and was in awe.<br />
Oh my god, he looks totally ripe. peel him and put him in your smoothy, I'm sure he will be very tasty.<br />
No dude, we can't do that. Bart was fine, he's just annoying, or was actually. but Erik is cool. I like him, <br />
and he is fucking hot... well he was before he became a banana.<br />
How long will he stay like this?<br />
for a week, Ricardo answered.<br />
Then let him just lay in the fruitbowl and see how far he gets, but when he starts showing too much brown <br />
spots during this week he's a gonner. I'll either just eat him or you can use him in your smoothy, but we <br />
can't let our friend here litterally rot away. <br />
Peter agreed, but said I should be given a chance.<br />
<br />
They put me back in the fruit bowl. I just had to wait and see what happens. The next day Peter picked me up <br />
again. I was bright yellow now, no brown spots there, and Peter decided to hold me in front of a mirror. I <br />
have to say, I looked so damn good. very delicious and ripe. and my muscles stood out very nicely. But my <br />
joyful moment was short lived as I could also spot a tiny black fly flying around. the weather was hot, I <br />
wasn't going to last for an entire week. I just knew it. Peter gently put me back and started to get to work <br />
on his daily smoothy, leaving me aside in the bowl. Later that day fresh fruit joined me as I was burried <br />
underneath it. Peter must have been in a hurry and forgot about me. As the lights went off I just waited again <br />
for the next morning.<br />
<br />
I felt the fruit being lifted off of me and it sure had not done me good. the weight had been pressing on top <br />
of me and all the touching made me go soft a little. I had brown spots all over my body and a small light <br />
brown dent in my left leg. I gulped.<br />
Peter looked at me and Ricardo said what I was thinking.<br />
He's not gonna make it Peter. one more day and he will be even too bad to eat.<br />
Peter just nodded and with that I could hear a pop. Oh god, no, no, no.<br />
Peter turned me upside down and started to pull on my feet, peeling one side of my skin down. Another side, <br />
and another side as he then held my banana body which looked kinda ok and tossed my skin into the trash. <br />
Strangely enough after peeling my body still had all my features. I looked just like myself, only made out of <br />
banana. The guys smiled, looking at me. <br />
I'm sorry Erik, you've been such a good friend and we can't let this mistake end with you rotting away. So we <br />
have decided you'll just be used as the banana you are. they both gave me a slight kiss and then Peter dropped <br />
me into the blender. It had not been turned on yet. He first poored in some yoghurt, added some strawberries, <br />
an apple, some kiwi, a bit of cinnemon. and then the lid was turned on top. <br />
<br />
Goodbye Erik, they said. I couldn't think, the machine was turned on and within a few seconds my body was <br />
sliced into small pieces, mixed with the yoghurt and the rest of the fruit and turned into a pulp. Amazingly I <br />
still was aware of things but becoming dizzy very fast. <br />
the machine went into higher gear and soon I was just part of a thick liquid.<br />
the lid was then taken off, as crushed ice was added and ones the lid was placed back on the machine did its <br />
work. I mixed for half a minute and then the machine was swiched off. I felt how I was poored into two glasses <br />
and then placed in the fridge. my awareness was strange, separated, I felt so weird, then my friends lifted <br />
their glasses and clang them together. Cheers. To Erik.<br />
To Erik they both said<br />
They slowly drank the first half, telling htem how amazing the bananaflavor was. I served them well as a <br />
banana, knowing before the day would end I would be inside the two of them completely and on my way to be <br />
digested. never ever to be seen again.</p>
