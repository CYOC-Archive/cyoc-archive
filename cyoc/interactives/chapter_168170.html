<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">October rushed into the room. Kelvin watched, a little confused, he made his way down the few steps before the bottom and looked into the room. What he saw, he couldn’t have even imagined.<br />
<br />
October was standing next to a girl, she was red, all over. Her hair, her skin, her lips, eyes, everything. Her body all over was big, like everywhere possible was rounded like a ball. Her belly looked pregnant, bigger than it should be. Her breasts were incredibly round. Her hips formed a circle, her butt, each cheek formed what looked like a bowling ball of shape. Her arms, each part as rounded as possible, her hand looked swelled up, her fingers. It looked like she was having some sort of allergic reaction. Her nose, the tip of it was rounded, her lips were circled, her cheeks were puffed up. Her head was rounded, unnaturally rounded. Her eyes were bulging, the pupils red as red an Apple. But as Kelvin looked at her face, her hair, he recognised who she was. Yuri.<br />
“Wh-what happened to her!?” Kelvin asked October, who was already preoccupied with the red girl,<br />
“I told you I put a curse down here, I didn’t know anyone else would be down here,”<br />
“Oh my god!” Kelvin yelled, “w-where’s Chelsea,”<br />
“Behind you,” October said back. Kelvin was looking at Yuri, he saw a green stem looking thing grow out of the top of her head. He turned himself around, expecting to see another bloated in many areas, red version of his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Instead, he was his girlfriend. But she wasn’t like before. She was grey, dull. Her hair was grey, getting greyer by the second. Her face was wrinkled, her skin looked frail and worn. He saw his girlfriends decently sized B cup breasts sagging, through her shirt, reaching just above her belly button. Her body was frail, weak. Her skin was thinner than before. Kelvin didn’t know what to do,<br />
“Kelvin...” the old woman Chelsea said, her voice decaying. She looked around 90 years old, and still rapidly aging.<br />
“Chel!” Kelvin said, he didn’t want to touch of fear he’d hurt her, “October!?” He quickly turned and yelled,<br />
“Here!” October yelled back, she conjured up a red mist, she reached her hand in and pulled out a small green yellow vial. She said, “catch,” and flicked the vial towards Kelvin. Without any ounce of bad coordination, Kelvin caught the vial without moving his hand too much. He pulled the cork right off the top of the vial and poured it down his girlfriend’s throat.<br />
<br />
He watched as her face almost immediately began to lighten. Her skin thickening, becoming a little more youthful. Her hair became a little darker, but retained its grey colour. Her wrinkles became a little less prevalent, but not disappearing completely. She seemed to have de-aged around 30 or more years, which would be pretty amazing if she hadn’t started at 90 years old. Kelvin was relieved, Chelsea looked down, she let out a breath, almost as if she’d been holding her breath for a while. But before anyone could get too comfortable, the now 60 year old Chelsea felt her stomach begin to gargle, like her stomach wasn’t reacting well to a food. Kelvin watched as her belly began to bloat outwards. Not with air, but with fat. Her belly got fatter and fatter, sticking out further. Her jeans button popped right off and flew across the room. Her flabby belly drooped over her waistline. Her legs thickened as this was happening her butt growing larger too, not huge but bigger. Then her breasts, they were already saggy, Chelsea wasn’t wearing a bra was not helping, but each breast grew a cup size, then another. By the end, her breasts were DD’s, sagging down to her stomach and resting in top of it.<br />
<br />
“What just happened to me!?” Chelsea yelled as loud as she could, her voice was still wobbly,<br />
“You drank an Age potion I made earlier today,” October said,<br />
“Why the hell did you make that?”<br />
“I didn’t mean to make it that strong, you’re lucky I had that vial, you would have become too old and might have-”<br />
“Yeah, yeah I get it. I’m guessing you didn’t mean to make that Apple do that, then?” Chelsea pointed to Yuri, who’s eyes were lost to space, dazing away somewhere completely different.<br />
“No I didn’t. And please don’t freak out but I can’t fix you,”<br />
“What!?” Chelsea yelled, immediately freaked out,<br />
“Wait! I can’t fix you yet, but when I get the power of my grandmother I will be able to. But you’re just going to have to be patient. Kelvin, you can go.”<br />
“What? No, I’m staying here,”<br />
“No, please. I can do this myself. I’d prefer it,”<br />
“Go, Kelvin,” Chelsea Saudi<br />
“B-but...”<br />
“Go. I’ll find you when I’m fixed later,”</p>
