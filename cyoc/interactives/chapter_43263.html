<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>"You know something Ron? I think... no, I know I am ready! Lead the way big guy!"</Br>
<Br>Ron grinned his fang filled grin, happy to hear Paul say that. Ron pushed the right door open of the right set of doors and held it open while offering Paul to go in ahead of him. Paul, thinking Ron was just being cordial, smiled and walked into the brothel. When Paul walked in, he immediately got a smile on his face, which was looking more and more lupine by the second, in seeing all of the men in the room that looked just like Ron. Paul looked back at Ron and found that he was standing right behind Paul with his bulge pressing up against Paul's right butt cheek.</Br>
<Br>Ron grabbed both of Paul's shoulders, pressing his bulge tightly against Paul's butt, squeezing Paul's newer and thicker shoulder muscles with his now half-lupine, half-hands/paws. "Well, what do you think Paul?"</Br>
<Br>Paul looked back at Ron's now half muzzled, big and black wet nose, glowing amber and forest green eyes, and fur covered face while simply nodding. Paul didn't really know what to say, he liked what he saw there, but something was already good to go in Paul's eyes.</Br>
<Br>"You know..." Paul said as he paused with his gruff and animalistic voice "What I see is good and all, but I think I have already found who I'd want to be with tonight."</Br>
<Br>Ron grinned his wolfish grin as his face finished pushing out into a muzzle. "Oh... and just who would that be?"</Br>
<Br>Paul smiled his now complete wolfish smile. "Well if you don't know, then I don't know. So, care for that drink you said you would have with me?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, don't mind if I do!"</Br>
<Br>The two, now completely transformed, werewolves ripped holes in both of their jeans to allow for their tails to be free, relieving some of the tension in their pants before they sat down. When they did, an equally attractive, brown furred wolf that was the bartender approached the two.</Br>
<Br>"So, what will you two wolves be having tonight? A country moonshine would be my pick!"</Br>
<Br>"Well, my new friend and I would like a country moonshine or two Barry."</Br>
<Br>"Sure thing Ron, it isn't often that wolves ask for anything else." Barry said with a fang-filled grin.</Br>
<Br>"No, and why should we? We werewolf are perfect the way we are. AWWWRRRROOOOO!"</Br>
<Br>Barry just nodded as he walked into the back area to get a new jug since he just sold the last bit to another new customer. Paul and Ron looked at each other for a second. Ron thought something was up with Paul and wondered what it could be. Not being one to be patient, Ron had to ask Paul what he was thinking.</Br>
<Br>"What...? What is that look for Paul?"</Br>
<Br>"It's for you, my fellow werewolf! I was just thinking that you are right and no werewolf could be any more perfect than you are." To which Paul gave a slight kiss to the right side of Ron's muzzle.</Br>
<Br>"You know Paul, you sure are one sweet werewolf! How about we take these drinks to my private room here where we can have a bit of alone time?"</Br>
<Br>"Sure! That sounds just like what the werewolf doctor ordered!"</Br>
<Br>As soon as Barry came out with the two full glasses of country moonshine, unlike Paul's first bartender, Ron thanked Barry and just told Barry to put it on his tab. Barry nodded and the two went into the back area, tails swishing happily behind one another. When they walked into the room, the two sat side-by-side on Ron's large sofa and sipped on their drinks. Feeling the need to get comfortable, Ron unbuttoned his extremely tight jean shorts, stood up and let them drop which left him free in the breeze. Paul just looked Ron over, admiring his sexy wolf body and his large, dripping cock... not to mention his baseball sized balls.</Br>
<Br>"Ah... there, much better... wouldn't you agree?" Ron exclaimed with a toothy grin.</Br>
<Br>Paul just nodded, staring and drooling over the sight that was there for the taking, if Paul wanted of course. With both men in their wolfish forms, their sex drives were ten times higher than in their human forms, more than likely it wouldn't take one of them long to give into lust. Paul leaned forward, placing his beverage on the table in front of him, then stood up and stripped as well. Ron, being the raging creature of virility he was couldn't help doing the same as Paul did with him. Ron liked what he saw and grinned at the fact that Paul was slightly thicker than he was, which was nice because he could really plow and get plowed like he wanted for so long with other wolves, but never got it because specimens such as himself and Paul were very rare.</Br>
<Br>As Paul sat back down, completely exposed like Ron, he picked up his beverage and just looked at Ron who was staring and drooling over both of their sizes. Paul knew what Ron wanted, but he wasn't sure if he was going to make Ron work for it or not. It was then and there that Paul had to think: was he going to just give into lust or was he going to take things slow and have Ron work for the meal before him?</Br></p>
