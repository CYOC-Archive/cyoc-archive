<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame Illusia had the full attention of the four 10-year-old boys now. They all showed a very boyish mixture of embarrassment and uncertainty. They were naked on a stage in front of a crowd of men, women, boys, and girls of all ages and were, by the looks of things about to undergo another change. <br />
<br />
The Madame turned to the crowd and asked, &quot;Should we bestow our two newest performers with their next change?!&quot; The crowed howled with approval and applause. &quot;Wha...what are you gonna do to them,&quot; Eric asked trying to stand up for his friends but sounding scared and insecure although in his current form and under the circumstances he couldn't help but act his age. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you mean what am I going to do to all of you?&quot; she retorted, &quot;You all will undergo changes. You two,&quot; she then pointed to Riley and Eric, &quot;already know what you will become, but as for you two,&quot; She walked behind the boys now and started to make hand motions get to be surprised this time!&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly Riley and Eric were overwhelmed with the sensation of electricity running through them and they tensed up. The 10 year olds quickly sprouted the fur over their hairless bodies that they had been covered in only 15 minutes before. The fur spread like wild a wild fire covering their entire bodies in just moments. They were already starting to look like the little lion cubs they had become earlier as their small juvenile manes grew in again and their faces pushed out, eliciting a voice cracking groans that changed into a very lion-ish growls, into muzzles. They both pushed their changing buts high into the air as their long tasseled tails reasserted themselves. Once that was finished they looked exactly like any normal lion cubs but suddenly both boys turned cubs changed hips bucked as they felt their boyhoods change species becoming their sheathed and barbed cub-hoods. The newly rechanged lion cubs shook as if to rid their bodies of something then looked with their bright blue eyes shown with both excitement and worry for what was to become of their other two friends. <br />
<br />
&quot;And now for you two.” Madame pointed,  “I will say from looking into your inner totems and seeing how truly close all four of you are to each other you are brothers in bond and it is truly inspiring. I may have been aggressive earlier with some of my other vict.... I mean performers. But they deserved it. The fact that I have discovered that each one of you would do anything for one another and that you all yearn to be young again together makes my job here easy. I have also seen that on different occasions each of you have expressed a desire and interest to be an animal. To feel what it is like to have a tail, fur, and even a sheath.” This emitted a chuckle from Scotty and Jack and what looked like the best attempts at grins and a slight purring from Riley and Eric. “I am compelled in most situations to fulfill the foolhardy and arrogant desires of people who come up on my stage, but it is nice to have a group like you all come up here for each other. Any perceived cockiness from before I believe was misinterpreted for courage to stand up to someone to protect your friends,” Madame Illusia said while winking at Eric.<br />
<br />
“So without further ado join your friends, because I know that you will enjoy the forms you are becoming. They are truly your inner animals.”  <br />
<br />
She stepped behind Scotty and Jack and made some gentle hand motions, as it was their turn to be electrified. Their little muscles tensed and relaxed all over their bodies as fur first started to grow from behind where their small hands had been blocking visual access of their groins. “Ohh common boys you know, I still have a performance to show let us see.” She made one quick motion and the boy’s arms moved tensely down to their sides. The fur that was growing had grown up their small pulsing ab muscles. Scotty’s was blond like the hair on his head, while Jacks was a dark gold almost brown color. Both boys suddenly lean forward feeling the urge to push their butts back. “Scot…Scotty it’s working we are changing!” Jack said giddily his young high-pitched voice helping to show his pure excitement. “I… “ Scotty groaned/moaned through the electric pleasurable slightly painful sensation he was feeling, “I wonder what we are becoming but I think we are about to sprout our RRRRR….” Scotty’s sentence ended with a voice crack that turned into a low growl as suddenly a loud pop was heard and the boys tail bones started to extend and cover in bushy fur. <br />
<br />
The fur had covered their entire torsos now and had started to work its way down their legs and over their arms when they both let out loud involuntary moans that cracked and ended up sounding like whining growls of a dog. Their boyhoods had stiffened and were now changing. They reddened as skin grew up the lengths of the shafts as their small balls were covered in fuzz that became fur. Small knots grew at their bases as their now fully canine tongues lolled out of their mouths. “We arrREe CHangiING INrrnrto doRRRGS” Scotty attempted to mouth but his now completely canine vocal cords cut him short. <br />
<br />
The puppy boys fell to their hands and knees as their hips rearranged themselves and their legs changed to fit a quardropedal stance. The changes moved to their heads where hair shortened and changed to become matching fur while ears flopped over. The only human part of their physical forms were their young faces which started to push out into canine muzzles and their transformation was complete. <br />
<br />
Many people in the audience had, had their phones out but now were taking pictures for some reason. “I agree I must get a picture of my first ever successful group of performers ever. Stephen come get a picture of us,” the Madame ordered. Her son came bearing a large camera and took 3 or 4 pictures. He then came and showed the group what they looked like. In the picture was Riley and Eric two lion cubs almost identical except for fur color and next to them sat tongues lolled out Scotty and Jack to golden retriever pups. <br />
<br />
“Now fellas I mentioned to you have the ability to regress yourselves to 10 years old or any age between your current and 10. And also have the ability to become your animal forms in cub form like you are now and in adult form like you would be at your normal ages. Go ahead and try to change back now, just imagine yourselves in your original forms.” The four young animals suddenly started to lose hair at an alarming rate and one at a time stood up as their changing musculature allowed them. Stephen managed to get one last picture of the four 19 year olds as they stood their on stage 2 with lion tails and lion hoods and two with doggy hoods and long bushy tails before they receded back into their now completely normal male bodies. <br />
<br />
Stephen ran back stage and got the boys clothing and returned it to them and they got dressed. Madame Illusia stepped in front of them and said in a quiet voice but still loud enough for the audience to hear, “You are all free to go as you please, enjoy many adventures with this gift I have just given you. You four are a proud bunch.” <br />
<br />
She turned around and yelled, “NOW, who is next?!”</p>
