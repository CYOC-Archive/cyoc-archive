<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob was soon using his new body like a pro, riding up and down on Greg’s thick feline cock with ease. His long and bushy fox tail wrapped itself around Greg’s shoulders as they passionately mated, teasing the tiger with its softness as they both grunted in pleasure.<br />
<br />
“So… We’re trying to rebuild an old civilization of animal people…” Jacob said between grunts as he impaled himself over and over on Greg’s pole. “And we’ve got magic powers to make more followers…”<br />
<br />
“That’s the gist of it,” Greg growled at the sexy fox relentlessly rode him. “It almost sounds impossible, but so did becoming… this. At this point, I’m willing to put in the work and see where this goes.”<br />
<br />
Jacob let out a piping laugh as the spirit of the Trickster filled him even more. He pushed down hard and sunk Greg’s whole length down into himself, and they both moaned in pleasure as they came, with Greg filling Jacob’s ass to the brim and Jacob spraying a jet all over his companion’s chest.<br />
<br />
They slumped down on the stone floor of the temple, panting in satisfaction as a new member was added to their group. Greg looked forward to the chance to gather his own followers, while Jacob was already thinking about tracking down some of his fellow anthropologists and seeing if they’d be interested in the archaeological find of the century, using a bit of his newfound trickery if needed. After all, his motorboat was still in working order, giving them a means to get to the other nearby islands with ease...<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the foreman of the construction site, Chuck’s father Bill was sitting in his office, and he was fuming in anger. For whatever reason, his main construction team had not reported back in hours, while his son was MIA. This was supposed to be a simple job. Put up a couple of cheap cabanas and a beach bar and call it a day, but for some reason everything had suddenly started going wrong. For what it was worth, Bill had pitched some big ideas about a world-class resort, but the investors had insisted on something a bit less impressive (and less expensive), so Bill had even more reason to be frustrated at the slow pace of work.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday he’d get to build the palatial resort of his dreams, but it certainly wouldn’t be here.<br />
<br />
As he impatiently went over his plans for the tenth time in ten minutes, he heard a door opening and looked up to see a handsome young man with dark skin, long dreadlocks, and a smattering of whitish spots painted around his face standing at the entrance to his office. He looked like one of the locals from the nearby islands, so Bill figured he was there to deliver some materials.<br />
<br />
“’Bout time!” Bill nearly shouted as he rose from his desk and stomped over to the young man, who only looked at him with an amused look on his face. Bill had the same build as his son, albeit with a bit of a belly, so he was used to throwing his weight around to get what he wanted.<br />
<br />
However, the young man didn’t even flinch as Bill got up in his face. He stared right back and grinned, as if he was in on some joke that Bill wasn’t even aware of. He reached into his pocked and pulled out a small fruit and stuffed it into Bill’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“What the f-“ Bill started to sputter through a mouthful of fruit, but the man pulled him close and locked their lips together, and Bill felt the man’s tongue twirling around with his as the sweet juice of the fruit coated his mouth. Now, Bill was straight as an arrow. Chuck was proof enough of that. But for some reason, he felt his mind clouding over as the strange young man continued to make out with him, and soon the two of them had moved over to the ratty old sofa in the corner of Bill’s office and began to passionately grope one another.<br />
<br />
Soon, their lips parted for a moment and the young man grinned again, showing off some unusually pointy teeth and glittering gold eyes with slitted pupils. “Mark. I’m Mark,” the man introduced himself in a lilting voice with the barest hint of an accent. “I used to be like you, but now I’m so much more…”<br />
<br />
Mark let out a purring laugh as he poked Bill’s slightly chubby stomach. Bill suddenly felt embarrassed that he’d let himself go so much, and he found himself admiring Mark’s lithe and taut body. His powerful biceps. His perfectly sculpted face. The impressive bulge outlined beneath his loincloth. His beautiful spotted tail…<br />
<br />
Wait, what? Bill blinked a few times. For a moment there, he imagined that he could see a tail sticking out from Mark’s backside… But that would be ridiculous, of course.<br />
<br />
“You used to be like me, huh?” Bill mumbled, continuing to run his eyes over Mark’s body. “Must have a hell of a workout.”<br />
<br />
Mark laughed even louder at that one. “Very cute. I like you, friend,” he purred, leaning in for another kiss. “But… You’re a bit too old for me. Let’s do something about that, hmm?”<br />
<br />
With that, Mark leaned in and planted another deep kiss onto Bill’s lips. As he did, Bill felt like all the air was being sucked out of him, with his stomach and chest pressing in and growing slender. He could feel decades of fat and aches disappearing in seconds, leaving only a youthful and slim body with just a hint of lean muscles. If Bill had looked into a mirror, he would be shocked to see a body of a youth even younger than his own son, not a day older than eighteen.<br />
<br />
But of course, Mark wouldn’t be stopping there. He dipped down and ran a rough feline tongue down Bill’s smooth chest, letting smooth brown fur burst out across his body. Thick and waterproof, perfect for keeping warm in the coldest waters, the beginning of an otter’s pelt. The fur quickly spread out from his chest until he had a dusting of fuzz across his arms and legs as well. Bill flinched as he felt his fingernails twist into claws and his ears were tugged up to the top of his head, becoming rounded and fuzzy.<br />
<br />
“Hush, a little pain never hurt anyone,” Mark cooed soothingly as he continued to stroke Bill’s changing body all over, gently guiding the transformation to its completion. Bill nodded and pressed his face into Mark’s chest, but was surprised to find a furry pelt of spotted fur as Mark shed his human disguise to reveal his jaguar body. However, he couldn’t bring himself to be afraid of the muscular predator… He felt safe and loved in Mark’s furry arms. Bill felt a hand (or rather, a paw) gently rubbing the base of his spine, slowly drawing forth a thick, muscular otter’s tail until it slapped against the couch beneath him and twitched in excitement<br />
<br />
Mark reached down and grasped Bill’s cock with his paw and gently stroked him off, reshaping his dick into a more beastly form. Animal pheromones filled the air, driving both men into a deeper mating frenzy, as Bill’s cock grew slim and pointed and his balls gained their own coating of thick fur. By now, Bill was about halfway done with his transformation from a middle-aged man into a twinky, youthful otter boi. The two men continued to grind against one another, rubbing their dicks together and matting their fur with precum until they both came all over one another and collapsed on their backs. Bill panted in exhaustion, while Mark rose gracefully and wiped off his sticky fur.<br />
<br />
“You’re looking much better, friend,” Mark said kindly as he flicked his tail in Bill’s direction. “By tonight, you’ll be complete. I’ve seen your desires, and if you like, you can build that palace of your dreams. Here, for me and my companions. …Just something to consider. See you again soon, I hope.”<br />
<br />
With a final wink, Mark slipped out of Bill’s office and reassumed his human disguise. Bill struggled to sit up, blinking in disorientation at the strange experience he just had. The smell of pheromones and sweat still filled the air, telling him that it had all been real, and his body truly did feel decades younger. He stood up and needed to hold onto his pants to keep them from falling off his newly slim waist as he looked out over the half-finished resort site, wondering what manner of bizarre situation he and his crew had found themselves in. However, Mark&#39;s promise of a chance to build what he had always wanted was tempting, and a vision of a great palace, decked out in gold and marble, flashed in his mind. He quickly grabbed a notebook and began making sketches, grinning and letting inspiration guide him...</p>
