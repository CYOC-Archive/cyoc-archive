<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shaken by her Kitsune families dire message Mika exhaled deeply as she gazed around the park. Could all of existence be coming to an end? It saddened her to think that everything she knew could come to an end. Looking towards Circes fiberglass castle she now noticed Jack and Kellie emerge with a teenage girl She vaguely remembered. Wiping her eyes the Kitsune now approached them. “Kellie practice is over already?”<br />
<br />
“Sort of,” she said stoically. “Not sure if you remember our daughter Ann she’s probably going to be here for awhile.” Mika bowed to the teen who still appeared quite shaken from whatever she had gone through. “Sorry about Ann,” Jack said softly. “She’s....had a rough time lately. How are things with you Mika? Everyone having a good time?”<br />
<br />
Mika paused, their would be time to discuss this threat tomorrow, for now she only wished to enjoy what time she had with her friends. “Things have been good so far,” she said sadly. “Everyone has been enjoying themselves so far.”<br />
<br />
Kellie raised an eyebrow as she looked the jade Kitsune over, something was off. She would have to talk with Mika later about what was bothering her, for now though she wanted to see how everyone else was. “Come on,” she smiled. “Let’s see what everyone is up to.” The goth teen could only nod as she now clung to her father, still to shaken to respond. As the four of them now approached Kellies friends they could hear them talking excitedly.<br />
<br />
“The I figure it one us should try it out Cmon,” Lisa exclaimed. “I know you want to try.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Samantha said quietly. “And besides why are you looking at me and Karen? Why doesn’t someone else go?”<br />
<br />
“Hey guys what’s going on,” Kellie asked. Kellies friends turned smiling happily as they now explained what was going on. “Well we ended just been watching a bunch of different people go on the rides,” Kumiko stated. “We’ve been having fun just watching everyone transform.”<br />
<br />
“That’s when I noticed Samantha and Karen,” Lisa grinned. “They seemed the most nervous about gong on the rides and transforming.”<br />
<br />
“So I was a bit freaked out so what,” Karen exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Same here,” Samantha added. <br />
<br />
“And that’s when Lisa came up with the idea of daring one of them to go on one of the rides,” Katie said. “That’s when you showed up. By the way how was practice.”<br />
<br />
“Interesting,” Kellie said quickly, not wanting to go into detail about Ann’s arrival. “So did you guys come to a decision.”<br />
<br />
“Still trying to come up with something,” Mary Elise said. “You have any ideas?”<br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her chin, a bit of mindless fun was just what the doctor order to put her at ease. As she now thought things over. Her lessons hadn’t exactly gone great and Ann’s appearance plus her dire warnings of what to come only worried her more. The only comical thing to come out of all this was the anthro lion toddler Ann had created. Smiling she now had an idea. “Well their is a daycare center around here,” she said. “Might as well use that for fun.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Claudia said. “But whose going to daycare?”<br />
<br />
“Flip a coin,” Kellie shrugged. “Heads It Samantha. Tails it Karen. Sound fair?” Samantha and Karen anxiously looked at one another, wondering how they were the ones that had been roped into this. “Guess it’s fair,” Karen sighed. “Still don’t know why it has to be us though.”<br />
<br />
“Probably because you two look nervous,” Lisa grinned. “Cmon it will only be temporary. Live a little.” Samantha and Karen now sighed, seemingly defeated the two agreed. Anxiously they now watched as Lisa took a coin out of her purse, tossing it into the air. As the two teens now watched it land they held their breath in anticipation. <br />
<br />
“Ah crap,” the Samoan teen groaned as she stared at the coin. Sighing she now looked at her friends. “Let me guess I’m going on the Merry Go Round.” Lisa and Kumiko nodded excitedly as they now hurriedly pushed Samantha towards the ride. As Samantha now stepped on the ride she noticed a small horse, a horse she guessed wouldn’t seem very small for long. “Do I really have to do this,” Samantha whined.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be such a wuss Sammy,” Lisa called. “I’m sure you won’t be the last, now start this baby up.” Samantha gasped as the ride jerked to a start. As she gripped the horse tightly she noticed it slowly begin traveling backwards.<br />
<br />
As the Merry go Round began to spin Samantha could feel an odd tingling sensation now course through her body. The Samoan teen wondered if this was the sensation others had felt when sitting on this ride. As Samantha lost sight of her friends she realized the next time she saw them she would only be 15. “Crap and my 17th birthday was close too,” she grumbled. “Note to self, get back at Lisa and the others when I get the chance.” As the ride went back slowly on the first turn, Samantha could already feel her bra getting looser as her breasts shrank slightly. Turning her head Samantha could see her friends come back into view.<br />
<br />
“How you feeling Sammy,” Karen called as the ride began to speed up. “Awkward,” she called. “I can feel the changes taking place and I am so getting you guys back for this.” As she now gazed at her friends, she realized she was a year younger than them. The moment passed though as once again she passed them in the opposite direction. <br />
<br />
Samantha’s changes were now beginning to speed up as the ride began going faster. Samantha could feel her body youthening, her impressive physique diminishing as she grew younger. As 15 became 14, she gasped as she watched her hands slide lower on the horse. She was shrinking  now her growth going in the opposite direction as she exited high school in the wrong direction. Her clothing was growing looser, her shoes bigger, her bra more useless as puberty reversed its flow.<br />
<br />
Passing her friends she would now catch their stunned expression. 15 became 14, which became a more youthful 13, that eventually became an awkward 12. Staring at her finds she could see the stunned expressions on their face. What was even more stunning was how much older and taller the girls now seemed to the rapidly diminishing Amazon.<br />
<br />
Samantha took stock of herself as she now began the journey back to 11. Samantha’s body was now rapidly losing not only height but muscle as well. Looking at her once impressive arms she could see them thinning as she continued to grow smaller still. As she looked down at her feet she was shocked to see her legs were now straight instead of being bent. She was growing so much smaller now, the once tiny horse now seeming not so tiny. Still the girl sped backwards.<br />
<br />
11 became 10, 10 became 9. Samantha’s feet no longer rested in the metal stirrups of the horse as she continued her backwards journey. Any sign of puberty had been completely erased from the girl. Samantha now tried adjusting her far too large clothes, blushing slightly as she realized if she stood up her pants would most likely drop off her narrow waist. Brushing her long hair out of her eyes, she once more looked at her friends, surprised to see how grown up the teenagers looked to her now.<br />
<br />
9 became 8, which became 7, which led to a now young 6. Samantha’s feet had been gradually lifting further and further from the stirrups with each rotation backwards. The tiny Samoan girl now found she had to wrap her arms around the horse to keep herself steady, her hands were no longer big enough to completely wrap around the pole. As the young girl now stared at her friends once more she found herself giggling. Samantha for whatever reason was feeling more carefree as she sped backwards. She was becoming less concerned with the worries of Samantha wanted to just have fun. Looking down at her feet she could see them resting several inches above the stirrups. Odd she thought, she could of sworn they reached before. Wiggling her toes she was surprised how big her sneakers felt and was surprised when they simply fell away exposing her far too large socks.<br />
<br />
The young girl now giggled as she continued traveling backwards as she went from 6 to 5 Samantha socks finally fell away from the tiny girls feet. Samantha giggled happily, seeming to enjoy the ride like any small child, not seeming to realize she was much older only moments before.<br />
<br />
Samantha’s friends watched as the ride now began to slow down. The 5 year old Samantha now became a preschooler of 4. The girls body thinning as she grew increasingly smaller. With one final rotation Samantha became a tiny girl of three, her body beginning to sport some baby fat on her toddler sized body. As the ride came to a stop Kellie and her friends were shocked to hear the young Samoan toddler chortling happily, seeming to rock on the horse and asking to go again. The anthro attendant having to help the young child off the ride. As Samantha was let off the ride, stepping out of her far too long pants, she looked up at her friends who would now be her babysitters.<br />
<br />
“Dat was fun I wanna go again,” she said excitedly.<br />
<br />
Kellie and the others smiled happily as they now took the young girls hand and began to make their way towards the daycare center. For Kellie and Mika they understood their would be dark days in the future. For now, they needed to enjoy a bit of happiness.</p>
