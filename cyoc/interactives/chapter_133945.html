<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided that it would be best to try the Chronivac with someone that he knows intricately. Even tho the thought of him becoming someone older and more muscular heavily interested him, he was still 16 and in high school so he didn&#39;t want to change into someone fairly older until he tested the device at least once. Jeff whipped out his phone and texted his best friend Evan, who was in the same classes as him. &quot;Yo, Something came in the mail that I want to show you. When are you free?&quot; Jeff texted Evan. After waiting 10 minutes near his phone while he was tinkering with the Chonivac, Jeff got a response from him. &quot;Hey, down to come over today. Should I come now?&quot; which Jeff responded with &quot;Ya, no1 is home right now. I&#39;ll let you in&quot;. Jeff figured this was the best option to test it out. While Evan was slightly bigger than Jeff, Jeff considered that being closer to Evan&#39;s older brother and dad was a good position to be in with the Chronivac. Evan&#39;s older brother was a wrestler in college and quite hunky. Meanwhile Evan&#39;s dad, who Jeff has seen dropping Evan off when they hang out, has a muscular bearish physique underneath his shirts, given that he is quite large in a muscular way. The thought of being either of them turned Jeff on greatly. <br />
<br />
Eventually Jeff saw Evan being dropped off by his hunky dad and was walking towards the front door. He rushed from his bedroom window downstairs to the door and opened it up before Evan could ring the doorbell. &quot;Hey, you got here fast&quot; Jeff said as he let Evan in. &quot;My dad wanted to go lift so he took me right away after I asked&quot; Evan replied. &quot;Anyways, so what did you want to show me?&quot; Evan inquired given that Jeff seemed excited. &quot;Its up in my room, but its a weird device that got sent to me in the mail. It has a few cool options that I thought we could try out&quot; Jeff said as they both walked up the stairs. &quot;That seems kinda sus, but I&#39;m down to test it out if it looks interesting&quot; Evan said hesitantly. Jeff knew he would probably show Evan the packages but omit the warning portion. Evan was cool and all but there wasn&#39;t a way to test this without giving someone else the short end of the stick. They got to his room and Evan saw the machine sitting next to his computer. &quot;Whoa this looks kinda high tech, have you tested it yet at all?&quot; Evan asked. &quot;Nope I figured I&#39;d wait for you because we both like this kind of stuff&quot; Jeff replied. Evan turned to Jeff and asked &quot;So what options does it have that you wanted to try? I assume you already looked through it a fair bit.&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyes trailed off a bit before talking and said &quot;Well there was one main option that looked cool but you might find it weird so you&#39;ll have to level with me on it.&quot; &quot;Alright, what exactly is it?&quot; Evan replied. Jeff sat down and began tinkering with the Chronivac while talking &quot;Theres a merge package listed on here as a primary function. I thought we both could use it to test it out and then maybe use it later to both of our benefits.&quot; Knowing that the merge was permanent, Jeff lied about the latter half to help convince him to try it out. &quot;What exactly do you mean by merge? Like we both become one person? Is it temporary?&quot; Evan inquired. Jeff lied and said &quot;Ya I can make the merge temporary between us to test it out. Then I figured we could both permanently merge into some jocks at school and live in some nice bodies.&quot; Evan liked the sound of that &quot;That sounds legit, do you know how to set it up?&quot; Jeff was eager with Evan willing to cooperate &quot;Ya I can get it set up, gimme like 5 minutes. Just lay on my bed for now.&quot; Evan laid down while Jeff began tinkering with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Jeff put in the options, knowing that he&#39;d be kinda fucking over his friend. However, he wanted a life as either Evan&#39;s hunky dad or older brother so it would be worth it in the end. He entered both his name and Evan&#39;s name into the Chronivac and it recognized both options. He set himself to be the host of their new body. Jeff also figured that he should set reality to change so he could continue with merging down the road without anyone suspecting a thing, even tho he would cease to be Jeff after this. He also set the body to be 100% Evan&#39;s, since Evan had a nicer physique than him due to being in swim club at school. He figured he&#39;d do the same with either his dad or brother too as the time came, given his current lanky body. Jeff turned around and said &quot;All set, you ready?&quot; to which Evan said &quot;Ya lets test it out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff hit the Enter button and walked over to Evan on the bed. &quot;Alright i&#39;ll see if it works and then undo it so we can use it on the jocks after&quot; Jeff lied as he started to lay into his friend. As soon as their feet touched, both were overcome with a large amount of pleasure. Evan throwing his head back and moaning as Jeff began to slide his feet in. It felt incredibly hot as he slid his smaller feet into Evan&#39;s feet, and he figured the merging was orgasmic for the targets so they&#39;d be cooperative as it happens. As their feet finished merging, Jeff looked down and saw only Evan&#39;s feet while he heard Evan&#39;s moans from behind him. He began to slide his thin legs into Evan&#39;s thicker calves and thighs while sitting backwards into him. He felt his legs become warmer and more powerful as they disappeared into Evan&#39;s hairy legs. Evan kept moaning and as the legs kept merging Jeff began to feel Evan&#39;s growing boner against his butt as he got closer while taking on his legs. As their thighs started to finish merging, Jeff felt himself being pulled onto Evan&#39;s shaft. It definitely felt bigger than his, something he&#39;d have to examine after he was done with this. Evan&#39;s rod began to enter his butt, which Jeff sensually felt it run past his prostate as it seemed to slide into where his dick was. They both continued to moan with eventually Jeff looking down and seeing himself sitting where Evan is with Evan&#39;s massive boner sticking out of his undies. Jeff continued to back into Evan&#39;s body and taking on his physique. His chest and abs slid into Evan&#39;s thicker set pectorals and his decent 2 pack. Jeff threw his arms back and found himself gain control of Evan&#39;s biceps and hands. Jeff fooled around a bit with his chest using his new hands and arms. Eventually he figured he should complete the process and pushed his head back into Evans. <br />
<br />
After a minute of darkness and silence he opened his eyes and found that the room had shifted to Evan&#39;s room. He got up and noticed that he felt stronger doing tasks. He walked over to his mirror and looked at his new body as Evan. He had all the same features as Evan but felt as if he was in control. Jeff found himself getting turned on slightly by this and threw off his clothes while hopping into bed. He began to run his stronger hands against his new rod, pumping up and down with his newfound strength. As he began to moan he noticed his voice was slightly deeper, matching Evan&#39;s voice. This turned him on further, eventually reaching climax where he shot thick loads out of his new cock. He felt even more pleasure fapping in this body than in his previous. After cleaning up he surveryed around his room further. He saw the Chronivac sitting on his new computer desk, looking operable as usual. He figured he should explore a bit and make sure everything worked. As he walked around the house, his new mother and brother treated him as if he was Evan. Everything seemed to truly work. As he went back upstairs he realized this meant he could now do it with either his older brother or his dad, transitioning to a more permanent residence. The questioned remained as to who he should choose. His brother has a strong wrestler&#39;s physique and probably got laid a lot while in college. However, his new dad was more stacked with his muscular bearish body. He sat down next to the Chronivac deciding his next action.</p>
