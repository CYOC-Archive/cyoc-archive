<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole woke up.  It was hard to tell how late it was, as the guest room lacked a clock, and she wasn&#39;t sure where her phone was.  There was a massive weight on her chest.  She had vague memories of the sex...if you can call it sex.<br />
<br />
She recalled Lee subdividing herself more, until she resembled a trio of little girls, who practically assaulted her (not that she offered any resistance) until she was unable to think...unable to do more than feel.  She felt pain and stiffness in her butt, and she managed to reach down to that area.<br />
<br />
Instead of an anus, however, there was a slit between her cheeks, and it was very tender- as she poked it, she gasped as she felt both pain and pleasure.  She pulled her hand back, and it was bloody.<br />
<br />
“What...the fuck?”  <br />
<br />
Looking around in the gloom, she reached for a light.  Laying atop her abdomen was Lee, or at least, one of her- reduced to an 8 year old girl.  She looked peaceful, her eyes closed.<br />
<br />
But Cole could tell her belly was swollen, making her look like she was pregnant!  Looking at her palms, she realized they now featured lips...with a thought, they opened, revealing shallow mouths!<br />
<br />
No teeth, and short, stubby tongues.  She was both fascinated and horrified by her mutation, when she looked to her breasts.  They were huge and...a white liquid was slowly seeping from her nipples!<br />
<br />
She placed a hand to her chest and her hand-mouth obligingly took a nipple and began to suck.  She could taste her own milk, and she moaned softly as she milked herself.  Soon she placed a hand on her other breast, and lay back, finding the sensation incredibly enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Her milk was a bit chalky, but she hungered for it.  The mouth between her legs felt dry, and she tried to feed herself a tiny mouthful of milk, but it did nothing to quench a growing thirst between her legs.<br />
<br />
And from between her butt cheeks, she felt a growing, uncomfortable pressure.<br />
<br />
Lee woke and it was at this moment Cole noticed the girl&#39;s right arm didn&#39;t end in a forearm and hand, but instead looked like a giant cock!<br />
<br />
“Oh...fuck...what...what did you do?”  Cole felt afraid.  She was some kind of sex crazed freak!<br />
<br />
Lee grinned and lowered her dick-arm between Cole&#39;s legs, offering it to the mouth there.  Against her wishes, her rogue body part began sucking on it, an action that made her feel great pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Oh that does feel nice, doesn&#39;t it?”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
“What did you do to me?”  Cole whined.<br />
<br />
“There, there.  I promised I&#39;d fuck you in ways you didn&#39;t know were possible, didn&#39;t I?  But I can see you&#39;re upset.” She retracted her strange limb, and before Cole&#39;s eyes, it turned back into an ordinary arm.  Then she crawled up and gently removed one of Cole&#39;s hands from her breast.<br />
<br />
Lowering herself, Lee began to drink Cole&#39;s milk.<br />
<br />
Cole whimpered and moaned, as this felt even more amazing!  Slowly, her right breast began to shrink rapidly, as Lee sucked all the milk out of it, then she repeated the process for her left breast, leaving her with no more than A cups.<br />
<br />
She then took Cole&#39;s hand and french kissed her new mouth, and when she pulled away, the mouth was gone.  She did the same with her other hand.<br />
<br />
“Am I...pregnant?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Technically, yes.  But not in the usual way.  I didn&#39;t fertilize your egg, but instead I took a part of myself and made it very small, and placed it inside your womb.  So that you will always have a part of me within you.”<br />
<br />
Lee then touched her belly, and it began to shrink, until it was flat once more.  “There.  I shrank them until they are very small, so that you aren&#39;t showing any longer.”<br />
<br />
“Them?”  Cole asked.  <br />
<br />
“Oh yes.  There are actually two tiny pieces of myself in there.  There&#39;s not much to do inside a womb, so they can keep each other company.  Relax.  What do you feel right now?”<br />
<br />
Cole tried to do as she was asked.  From somewhere inside her, she felt very aroused and turned on.  “What...what is that?”<br />
<br />
“They&#39;re having sex.  Inside you.”  Lee grinned.  “Like I said, not much to do in there.  Just think, Cole.  You&#39;ve become my mother.  The first one I&#39;ve ever had.”<br />
<br />
Cole gulped.  “But...when...how will they be born?”<br />
<br />
Lee shrugged.  “There&#39;s no rush.  That&#39;s why I made your breasts small again.  I will be leaving you with your pussy though so you can give birth when the time is right.”<br />
<br />
“My...but it&#39;s a mouth!”<br />
<br />
“Yes but I gave it back.  Just in a different place.”  <br />
<br />
“Oh my God...you mean...”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  You no longer have an anus, but a butt pussy.”  Lee giggled.  “As you might have noticed, I took your virginity already.”<br />
<br />
“You little wench!”  But Cole wasn&#39;t really angry.  If anything...the thought of Lee being inside her (two of her, no less) and the strange, warped sex...made a part of her want more.<br />
<br />
Lee just smiled.  “I am a demon you know.  And now, so are you.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?  Really?”<br />
<br />
The tiny girl held her thumb and forefinger slightly apart.  “Just a tiny bit.  A human wouldn&#39;t be able to sustain even such tiny pieces of myself, let alone handle all the changes I&#39;ve made to your anatomy.  Fragmented like this, I couldn&#39;t affect a full transformation, and I&#39;m sure the rest of me would be annoyed if I did it on my own anyways.”<br />
<br />
“The rest...of you?  Aren&#39;t you all Lee?”<br />
<br />
“Nominally, yes.  But...right now we&#39;re not in contact with each other.  It&#39;s one of the risks of doing something like this.  So when we reform, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be at least a little peeved.”  Lee giggled.  <br />
<br />
“So you&#39;re just...a part of her personality?  The deviant part, I&#39;m guessing.”<br />
<br />
Lee grinned.  “Guilty!  I&#39;m sexually perverse and full of lust!  She normally keeps me on a short leash.  Actually, the little ones inside of you are as well.”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s going to want them back, you know.”  Cole pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Oh probably, but I think she&#39;s going to enjoy feeling what it&#39;s like inside of a womb.  Completely surrounded by another person, one who cares for her deeply.  And you do, regardless of what you may claim.”<br />
<br />
Cole nodded.  “I...it&#39;s true.  I didn&#39;t want to admit it, because Winryaa loves you too.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s alright.” Lee sighed.  “So many people love me.  I wish I knew what it was like.  On the plus side, I know I really like fucking you.  The noises you make are...exquisite.”<br />
<br />
“Uh...I don&#39;t know what to say to that.”<br />
<br />
Lee grew a few years older, until she had noticeable buds on her chest.  “You&#39;re supposed to say you like being fucked, and want more.”<br />
<br />
Cole smiled.  “I do.  And I do.”<br />
<br />
“Good.”  Lee kissed her and placed her hands on Cole&#39;s smaller, but very sensitive breasts...<br />
<br />
<br />
Marion realized she must have dozed off.  Lee was laying with her head on her chest, her long dark hair splayed out over her breasts.  She stroked the girl&#39;s hair gently.  She looked years younger when asleep, so innocent...it made Marion feel a pang of regret.  What had she done?  The girl may be mature for her age, but she was a child!<br />
<br />
And she was a grown woman, no longer young.  “I&#39;m sorry.”  She whispered.<br />
<br />
Without moving, Lee replied.  “Don&#39;t be.  If I didn&#39;t want this, I would have turned you away.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  I thought you were asleep.”<br />
<br />
Lee shifted a little, getting comfy.  “Please don&#39;t stop.  Touching my hair, that is.  It turns out that I like it as much as Cindy does.”<br />
<br />
Despite her feelings, Marion smiled.  “Me too.”<br />
<br />
“Listen, Marion.  I understand.  You see me as a child.  There&#39;s a part of you that has been taught that this is wrong.  It&#39;s not.  It really isn&#39;t.  You didn&#39;t take advantage of me.  You needed comfort, and I could provide that.  And I have to admit, the sex was quite good.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s something to be said for a woman with experience.” Lee sighed.<br />
<br />
Marion blushed a bit.  “I think I might have a little too much of that.”<br />
<br />
“Nonsense.  Listen.  I&#39;ve had sex with lots of teenagers lately.  They are...energetic...enthusiastic...but they lack...expertise.  It&#39;s been awhile since you were with another woman, but you&#39;ve left me quite satisfied.”<br />
<br />
“Well...I tried.” <br />
<br />
“And it&#39;s appreciated.  How do you feel?”<br />
<br />
“Ah..better.  Not all the way there.  But...I forgot what it felt like to be with someone like you.  Trent could be gentle, but not like you.”  Marion admitted.<br />
<br />
“Just because I&#39;m gentle doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know what I want, and how to get it, Marion.”  Lee pointed out.<br />
<br />
“That...is true.  You were a bit aggressive at some points in there.  I bet you left bite marks.”<br />
<br />
“Only little ones.”  Lee grinned.  “Once everyone knows about us, I can do more than just nibble.”<br />
<br />
“Should we tell anyone?”  <br />
<br />
“Absolutely.  You and your children need to be open with one another.”  Lee insisted.<br />
<br />
“Yes...but it&#39;s going to be weird.  Oh Cindy, I had sex with the same girl you did!  And then you said that Alison wants to be with you as well...”<br />
<br />
“How do you feel about that?”<br />
<br />
“I...it&#39;s like I said.  I wish she&#39;d stay a child longer.  But I know you&#39;ll take good care of her.  Isn&#39;t that the most important part?”<br />
<br />
“It is.  You know, you could teach her yourself.”  Lee&#39;s voice was gentle and soft.<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s my daughter!”  Marion was horrified.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  And who better to be a child&#39;s first lover?  I know, conventional morality says otherwise, but it&#39;s like I&#39;ve pointed out before, where do you think Seth&#39;s wife came from in the Bible?”<br />
<br />
“I...uh...”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s right, they don&#39;t talk about that.  Adam and Eve bore three sons.  But they had daughters as well.  And someone lay with the boys before the girls were old enough.  Remember that Eve was very long-lived.  She remained a young woman for quite some time.  Be fruitful and multiply.”<br />
<br />
Marion blushed.  “Still...it feels wrong.”<br />
<br />
“Sarah and Andy would accept you into their bed gladly.”<br />
<br />
“I...no...that&#39;s...”<br />
<br />
“True and you know it.  Your sister loves you, and she&#39;s not afraid to admit her love.”<br />
<br />
Marion sighed.  “This isn&#39;t who I am.”<br />
<br />
“No, I disagree.  This is very much who you are.  But you denied yourself.  Buried your true self, and became someone else.  Became the dutiful wife and mother you thought Trent wanted you to be.  Because you loved him.<br />
<br />
Loved him more than he ever truly loved you.  Now that part of your life is over.  It&#39;s time to come out of your cocoon, Marion.  Spread your wings and fly.”<br />
<br />
Marion sighed.  “I&#39;m too old to start over.”<br />
<br />
“Oh please, you&#39;re not yet forty!  But...what if you could be?”  Lee&#39;s rose, staring down at Marion.  Her dark blue eyes seemed to shimmer in the dim light.  “What if you could be young again?  22?  18?  Even younger?  What if you could go back to the first moment when you realized you had desires...desires you were afraid to sate?  When was the first time, Marion?”<br />
<br />
Marion bit her lower lip.  “I was 12.  A friend of mine had a birthday and a sleepover that weekend.  We were pretty close friends.  So close she woke me up and said she couldn&#39;t sleep on the floor...but wanted to know if I&#39;d come to her room and sleep with her.<br />
<br />
I said yes, of course.  We went upstairs and got into her bed, and she put her arms around me.  I&#39;d slept like this with Sarah when she was younger, so I didn&#39;t think anything of it.  I held her back.  It felt good.  I remember how warm she was.<br />
<br />
I must have dozed off, because I woke up and she was crying.  I asked her what was wrong.  She told me something was wrong with her.  That she knew she was supposed to start liking boys, but she didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
I told her that was fine, we were still young, it was fine if she didn&#39;t have those feelings.  But she said I didn&#39;t understand.  She had feelings...but not for boys.  And then she kissed me.<br />
<br />
Well, I was surprised!  But it felt nice too.  So I kissed her back.<br />
<br />
We didn&#39;t make love, not really.  Neither of us knew what to do, so it was mostly just kissing and cuddling, touching each other.  Obviously, I couldn&#39;t tell my parents.  Dad was a lot like Trent in some respects.  So I kept quiet.<br />
<br />
We would trade notes in class, or talk on the phone.  I couldn&#39;t wait for the next time I could sleep over.  But it never happened.   One day, Tabitha didn&#39;t show up for school.  Her family pulled her out and moved to another state.<br />
<br />
I got one letter from her.  They found out she was gay by reading her diary.  She never mentioned me by name, and refused to tell anyone who I was.  So they got her away from whoever was influencing their little girl and forced her into therapy.<br />
<br />
I tried looking for her when I got older, but she had moved again.  I don&#39;t know what happened to her.”<br />
<br />
Marion was crying now, and Lee moved to hold her.<br />
<br />
“I mean, it wasn&#39;t meant to be, right?  I love my kids.  If Tabitha and I could have somehow...made it work...I wouldn&#39;t have Cindy and Alison now.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s true.  But at the same time, it sounds like you lost something important.  But obviously, you have been with other girls.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, well, when I was in college.  It was nice.  I kept it quiet from my parents, who I knew would explode.  One of my girlfriends, Alison...yes, that&#39;s where I got the name...she suggested I date a guy so they wouldn&#39;t suspect anything.<br />
<br />
Even though I really liked girls, I was attracted to guys too.  I met Trent at a party.  He wasn&#39;t drinking.  He seemed so nice and handsome.  Anyways, one thing led to another, and I found myself falling for him.  But his family was traditional as well, in some ways, more so than mine.  So I had one last fling and devoted myself to him.”<br />
<br />
“You never told him.”<br />
<br />
“How could I?  Even if he didn&#39;t call me the Whore of Babylon, his family would, and there&#39;s no way I could force him to choose me over them.”  Marion hung her head.<br />
<br />
“Well.”  Lee kissed Marion on the cheek.  “Like I said, that chapter is over.  You didn&#39;t answer my question though.  What if you could go back and try again?  Go to sleep and wake up as that 12 year old girl?”<br />
<br />
“And my kids?”<br />
<br />
“Cindy is almost an adult.  And I&#39;d help you, of course.”<br />
<br />
Marion sighed.  “I&#39;d like it, I think.  But it&#39;s impossible.”<br />
<br />
Lee nibbled on Marion&#39;s earlobe, much to the woman&#39;s pleasure.  “Wanna bet?”<br />
<br />
<br />
Alison woke up.  She was naked in bed, flanked by Lee and Tara.  Who were both demons.  Tara had her leg back (since she was, after all, a shapechanging Succubus named Winryaa).<br />
<br />
And she&#39;d just had sex for the first time.  She shivered at the thought.  The two had taken turns pleasuring her, while the other kissed her and did...other things.<br />
<br />
She had drifted off to sleep while cuddling with them both.  It had been better than she&#39;d ever imagined it could be!<br />
<br />
She sighed happily.  She had no idea what Cindy or her Mom would think, but it was too late to go back now.  The only problem was, while the two demons were happy to have sex, neither of them could really be her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Winryaa had admitted she was in love with Lee (who was also a demon named Dantalyon), and Lee, according to her, couldn&#39;t love anyone.  She could like people.  Even be fond of them. But she feared she could never love someone.<br />
<br />
This was too bad, because Alison still had a major crush on both of them.  Still, friends who she could have sex with weren&#39;t bad, even if she&#39;d have to share them with others.<br />
<br />
Her brother had sold his soul to Lee, in order to become a girl.  That means one day, she&#39;d go to Hell.  Obviously, this meant that Alison would have to arrange to go there as well.  Selling her soul was a guarantee, but for what?<br />
<br />
A girlfriend?  That sounded dumb.  Eternal youth?  No point, really.  If she became a demon, she might be able to look however she wanted.  The more she thought about it, being a demon was kind of it&#39;s own reward.  <br />
<br />
In her sleep, Tara shifted and lay her hand on Alison&#39;s chest.  The brush of her hand against Alison&#39;s sensitive nipple was both distracting and pleasant, disrupting her thoughts.  Alison felt very warm and felt an ache in her groin.  She reached down to touch herself, but a slender hand grabbed her wrist.<br />
<br />
She turned her head to see Lee staring at her.  “Allow me.”<br />
<br />
The beautiful girl moved between Alison&#39;s legs, and pushed them gently apart, before placing her palm over the soft skin between them.  Alison whimpered a bit.<br />
<br />
“Oh...please...”  She begged.<br />
<br />
Lee smiled and leaned down, opening Alison with her fingers and began to probe and lick her pussy with a hot tongue.  Alison moaned and this woke Tara up.<br />
<br />
“Oh, are we doing her again?”  The innocent-looking girl smiled.<br />
<br />
Lee didn&#39;t respond, as she took pleasuring the girl as seriously as she did most things.<br />
<br />
Tara began to grow, her body becoming more mature, and her hair becoming short and red.  Orange eyes seemed to glow in the low light, and her wings unfurled from her back, even as her tailbone extended, and soon, her whip like tail swished about.<br />
<br />
Taking her tail, she began to rub the heart-shaped tip of it against Alison&#39;s nipple.  Sex appeal seemed to ooze off of Winryaa, somehow managing to make Alison even more aroused.<br />
<br />
“Do you like this, Ali?”<br />
<br />
Alison nodded.  “Y...yes!”<br />
<br />
Winryaa moved to straddle Alison&#39;s smaller body.  The Succubus didn&#39;t weigh very much so it wasn&#39;t uncomfortable.  “Do you want to make me feel good?”<br />
<br />
Alison nodded her assent.<br />
<br />
Winryaa placed the tip of her tail against Alison&#39;s mouth.  “Bite it, please.”<br />
<br />
Dubiously, Alison bit the Succubi&#39;s tail.  It&#39;s flesh was warm and soft.  Immediately, Winryaa let out a shuddering gasp, and she placed her hands on her breasts.  “Oh...oh that feels wonderful...more of that...please...”<br />
<br />
Her teeth couldn&#39;t break the skin of Winryaa&#39;s tail, but her attempts seemed to excite the Succubus more and more, and soon the demon was rubbing her clit against Alison&#39;s skin.<br />
<br />
The scent of her was strong and it was driving Alison wild.  She wanted to taste her so badly!<br />
<br />
Then she finally came, and couldn&#39;t think about much of anything for a little while.  Lee cleaned her with her tongue, before moving to lay at her side once again. “Winryaa, dear, I think she wants to do more for you.”<br />
<br />
Winryaa began to shrink again, until she was no bigger than a small child, and Lee helped her to straddle Alison&#39;s head.  The demon girl&#39;s pussy was right up against Alison&#39;s mouth, and she reached out with her tongue and began to eat out another girl for the first time.<br />
<br />
The scent reminded her of her grandmother&#39;s spice cabinet, and the demon girl tasted like cinnamon.  Her tongue filled the demon&#39;s tiny pussy and she greedily lapped her out.  Lee had taken the girl&#39;s tail, and her teeth -could- break the skin.  Red blood flowed from her lips and Winryaa screamed, her hips bucking against Alison&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
An explosion of warmth covered Alison&#39;s face and her mouth was full of sticky liquid, which she greedily consumed until the girl was spent.<br />
<br />
Whimpering softly, Lee set the tiny demon in the crook of Alison&#39;s right arm, where she cuddled up against her like a small child.  Then Lee leaned over Alison and licked her face with her tongue, making the girl giggle.<br />
<br />
“So what do you think of demon juice, hmm?”  Lee smiled.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s good!”  Alison answered.<br />
<br />
“We can&#39;t let you have too much, it&#39;s a bit rich for a mortal girl.”  Lee placed a hand on Alison&#39;s tummy.<br />
<br />
“I want to be a demon.”  <br />
<br />
“Do you?”  Lee smiled.  “I can arrange that.”<br />
<br />
“Could I be a Succubus like Winryaa?  Able to change my shape?”<br />
<br />
“Certainly, if you like.  With the power to entice anyone you desire.  And to feed from their pleasure.”<br />
<br />
Alison smiled.  “It sounds like the best thing ever.”<br />
<br />
“Even though you&#39;ve awakened sexually, you&#39;re still quite pure though.  A pure soul can cause problems for a demon.  Winryaa can attest to that.”<br />
<br />
Alison pouted.  “Do I need to be more evil?”<br />
<br />
“Could you be more evil?”  Lee kissed her.<br />
<br />
“Mmm...I can try.”  Kissing girls was the best, Alison decided.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think Cindy is ready for that.”<br />
<br />
“I guess not...but it is what I want.”  The girl countered.<br />
<br />
“If you sold your soul to me, I could make you a part demon.”<br />
<br />
“I want to.  But I don&#39;t know what to ask for.  As a demon, I could have anything I wanted.”<br />
<br />
“Well maybe not anything.”  Lee looked sad.  “For most demons, love is impossible.”<br />
<br />
“You really want to feel it, don&#39;t you?  You wish you were in love.”<br />
<br />
Lee paused, but then nodded.  “Yes.  I want nothing more than to be able to love.  I can feel that you love me.  Winryaa.  Your mother and your sister.  And I feel...well I feel something for you, but it&#39;s nothing like...what I used to feel, long ago.”<br />
<br />
“For G...uh...you know.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  For my Creator.  Every bit of me yearned for that love. Wanted to hear their voice.  Wanted to serve.  Then humans were created and we didn&#39;t know why.  Didn&#39;t understand.  And they didn&#39;t tell us.  Were we not good enough?  Were we being discarded?  Did we do something wrong?”<br />
<br />
Lee paused.  “I can&#39;t even cry.  Even though it hurts inside.”<br />
<br />
Alison reached out with her hand to touch Lee&#39;s face.  “I&#39;m so sorry.”<br />
<br />
Lee placed her own hand over Alison&#39;s.  “I know.  And I appreciate that.”<br />
<br />
“If I sold my soul, I could wish for anything, right?  Could I wish you would fall in love?  Not with me...but with someone?”<br />
<br />
Lee sighed.  “If only it worked that way.  Another demon, Gemory.  She got lucky and something like that -did- work.  It was a very special circumstance.  I envy her.”<br />
<br />
“That sucks.  I want to help.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Alison, I deeply appreciate you.  You would do it, wouldn&#39;t you?  Give up your soul to make me happy?”<br />
<br />
Alison nodded.  “Of course!  You deserve it!”<br />
<br />
“You precious child.  Whoever falls in love with you, will be truly blessed.”<br />
<br />
“Wouldn&#39;t cursed be a better word, if I become a demon?”  Alison grinned.<br />
<br />
“A blessing and a curse can be very similar, depending on one&#39;s point of view.  You know, I can make any mortal fall in love with you.  It&#39;s a simple thing.  Would you like someone special?”<br />
<br />
Alison frowned.  “It sounds nice, but it wouldn&#39;t be real.  They wouldn&#39;t love me for who I am.  Only because of you.”<br />
<br />
“I assure you, honey, I you could make most anyone love you for real.”  Lee smiled.<br />
<br />
“You think so?  Wouldn&#39;t that be nice.”  Alison smiled back.<br />
<br />
Lee got a faraway look.  “Oh.  Speaking of making a deal, apparently my other self is making an offer as we speak.”<br />
<br />
“Your other self?” Alison blinked in confusion.<br />
<br />
“This is just a part of me.  I&#39;m currently in multiple locations at the moment.  I let Cole punish me, and she decided I should be with everyone tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow, that&#39;s cool!  I didn&#39;t know you could do that!  What&#39;s the other you doing?”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s with your Mother...”<br />
<br />
Alison gasped.  “Mom?  Mom is going to sell her soul?”<br />
<br />
“She hasn&#39;t accepted yet.  I&#39;m surprised...I wouldn&#39;t have revealed our true nature so soon.”  Lee frowned.<br />
<br />
“What does she want?”<br />
<br />
“Something most mortals would give anything for.  Lost time.  She wants to be young again.”  Lee replied.<br />
<br />
“Ooh.  Do you think she&#39;d be happier that way?”  <br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know.  She&#39;s hurting right now, but I guess the question is, how would you feel about it?”<br />
<br />
Alison considered that.  “I&#39;d be ok with it.  How young does she want to be?”<br />
<br />
Lee concentrated.  “Our link is weak right now.  Probably so we won&#39;t be distracted.  She told me...the other me...a story about when she was young.  Her first love.”<br />
<br />
“Ooh.  Who was he?  Not Dad, I know.”<br />
<br />
“She.  Her first love was a girl.”<br />
<br />
Alison&#39;s eyes widened.  “No way!”<br />
<br />
“Her name was Tabitha.  Your Mother was 12...it ended quickly.  The girl&#39;s parents found out she was in love with a girl, and they moved away.  Tabitha didn&#39;t tell them who it was.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no...” Alison felt very sad.  “So she wants to be 12 again?  Wow.  She&#39;d be almost my age.”<br />
<br />
“If she accepts.  But even if she&#39;s young, it won&#39;t give her that love back.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s where you come in.  You can make someone love her.”  Alison pointed out.<br />
<br />
“But it wouldn&#39;t be real?”<br />
<br />
“She doesn&#39;t have to know that.  Please.  Even if I have to make a deal with you.”  The girl pleaded.<br />
<br />
“You truly are a wonderful girl.”  Lee kissed Alison again, forcing her tongue into the younger girl&#39;s mouth.  When she pulled away, Alison looked dazed.<br />
<br />
“Winryaa, I leave her in your care.  I&#39;m going to rejoin myself.”  Lee vanished.<br />
<br />
Winryaa found the strength to grow once more, though she was still smaller than Alison.  She hugged the other girl.  “I agree with her.  You are a special girl.”<br />
<br />
“Is it ok if I love her too, Winryaa?”<br />
<br />
Winryaa smiled.  “Of course.”<br />
<br />
Alison paused before continuing.  “Is it ok If I love you as well?”<br />
<br />
“Oh Alison...that would make me very happy.”  The demon girl kissed her friend.  “I never knew I could be so blessed.”<br />
<br />
The two cuddled in each other&#39;s arms, kissing, until Alison drifted off to sleep once more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee had decided to lay her cards on the table.  Marion looked stunned, even aghast.  <br />
<br />
“You can&#39;t be a demon.”<br />
<br />
“Oh but I am, Marion.”  Lee grew in size, matching her normal form, though she remained female.  Perhaps it was all the time she&#39;d been spending as Lee, but she found she rather enjoyed being a girl now.<br />
<br />
Marion looked frightened.  “No...”<br />
<br />
This was taking a lot out of her, but then she felt one of her other selves return, melding with her.  Ah, it was the one who had been with Winryaa and Alison.  This side of her felt she had moved too quickly, and, in truth, Dantalyon agreed.  But the die was cast.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re afraid of me.  Don&#39;t be.  Please.  I mean you or your children no harm.”<br />
<br />
“How...how did they meet you?” <br />
<br />
“Random chance, really.  But from the very moment I met them, I could tell there was something special about them.  And not just them...you and your sister as well.  You all resemble each other so greatly.  And yet you are all different.”<br />
<br />
“What do you want from us?”  Marion demanded.<br />
<br />
“Believe me, please.  I want you to be happy.”  Dantalyon shrank once more, becoming Lee again.  “I will do anything in my power to grant you happiness.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t understand, why?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t fully understand either.  But it&#39;s true.  I already helped Cindy.”<br />
<br />
“Helped her with what?”  Marion was confused.<br />
<br />
“Do you remember the day she was born?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I do, it was..” Marion frowned.  “Wait...why can&#39;t I remember...”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s because I changed Cindy&#39;s life.  Granted her something impossible.”<br />
<br />
Marion was still trying to remember, oh that&#39;s right, how could she have forgotten the day she gave birth to her...son...<br />
<br />
She gasped.  “Wait.  Oh my God...Luke!  I have a son!”<br />
<br />
“You did have a son.  But Luke, deep down, didn&#39;t want to be a boy.”<br />
<br />
Marion&#39;s face paled.  So many things finally clicked for her.  “Oh God...Oh God...Trent...what did he do?”<br />
<br />
“The story I heard was that there was a wedding.  And Luke was admiring the pretty dresses, and Trent pulled him aside and told him...”<br />
<br />
Marion began to weep as she remembered.  “Oh my boy...I failed you...”<br />
<br />
Lee put her arms around the woman.  Marion stiffened, but then relaxed.  “No one blames you.  You turned a blind eye to Trent, it&#39;s true.  But you were still a wonderful parent.  You raised two amazing children.  And Luke is happy now.  As Cindy.  Your daughter.”<br />
<br />
Marion nodded.  “Do they know what you are?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  I told them.  Cindy was confused at first.  And Alison thought it was &#39;cool&#39;.”<br />
<br />
Marion laughed despite herself.  “Oh she would.  God...how can you be a demon?  You don&#39;t seem evil.”<br />
<br />
“Good and Evil are not as clear as one might suppose.  I have done terrible things.  But I have done good things as well.  Let me tell you the truth.  About my real family.”<br />
<br />
Lee gave Marion the account of the Rebellion.  How it had happened, and what the results had been.<br />
<br />
“I am sorry for lying before.  You felt sorry for me when I told you about losing my parents.”<br />
<br />
Marion was quiet for a bit.   Then she spoke.  “It wasn&#39;t really a lie.  You lost your Father.”<br />
<br />
“And my Mother.  Don&#39;t think that God can be defined by one gender.  I was created to love my creator.  To serve him with all my being.  Just hearing their voice, being in their presence, was the most wonderful thing in the universe.  And then...it was gone.”<br />
<br />
Marion hugged the other girl then.  “I&#39;m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“I appreciate that.  But it wasn&#39;t your fault.  Technically, it was my own fault, for not trusting in The Plan.”<br />
<br />
“Still.  It seems like a harsh punishment.  The Bible says Lucifer was evil.  But it&#39;s more complicated than that, isn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
“Most things are.”<br />
<br />
“So Luke...Cindy...sold their soul to you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  But don&#39;t think for a minute that entitles her to eternal torment.  Hell is no paradise, but it can be much nicer than you might suppose.  Only the truly wicked burn forever.  Most eventually come to terms with whatever actions led them to Hell.  Some even become demons themselves.”<br />
<br />
“Like Tara.”  Marion realized.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Her name is Winryaa, and she is a Succubus, and one of my most loyal retainers.”<br />
<br />
“This is a lot to take in.”<br />
<br />
“What does your heart tell you?”<br />
<br />
Marion took in a deep breath, then let it out.  “That you&#39;re still the same girl who tried to comfort me.  That I found myself attracted to.”  She then laughed.  “I guess now I don&#39;t have to worry about being older than you.”<br />
<br />
“Probably not, no.  Your soul has lived many times, so you&#39;re older than you think, but yes, I predate humanity by a good bit.”<br />
<br />
“So it&#39;s true, what you said about reincarnation.”<br />
<br />
Lee nodded.  “Yes.”<br />
<br />
“But Cindy will go to Hell when she dies?”<br />
<br />
“There is no way around that.  But I will give her a high position in my court, and treat her very well.  She will, of course, become a demon.  She has a warrior&#39;s spirit, and she&#39;d rather cut off her own arm than be disloyal.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s...true.  Oh, but Alison...she hasn&#39;t...?”<br />
<br />
“Not yet.  She wants to.  I haven&#39;t accepted yet.  She thinks being a demon is amazing...and, well...if her sister isn&#39;t in Heaven, then it&#39;s no paradise for her.”<br />
<br />
“Why?  I mean, why haven&#39;t you accepted?”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s still pure of heart.  Not innocent, but not jaded either.  I...I don&#39;t want to damage that.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re very strange for a demon.”  Marion noted.<br />
<br />
“Yes, it&#39;s true.  I would much rather collect wicked souls, I don&#39;t usually tempt the pure of heart.  But Luke was in pain.  I make an exception for that.”<br />
<br />
“If I know my girl, you might as well give in.  She won&#39;t stop pestering you about it.”<br />
<br />
“You aren&#39;t afraid for her soul?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I am.  But she will always want to be where Cindy is.  So what&#39;s the point?  And I trust you.  That may be foolish of me, but I do.”<br />
<br />
Lee kissed Marion then.  “You are a truly magnificent woman.”<br />
<br />
Marion smiled.  “You think so?”<br />
<br />
“I do.  Now tell me.  Do you want to be a girl again?  To feel love like you did when you were young?”<br />
<br />
“I...I do.  Oh but what will the kids think?”<br />
<br />
“I can assure you that Alison thinks it&#39;s a great idea.”  Lee chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Oh you told her...wait...when?  How?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t do it very often, but tonight was special.  I can split myself, and be in several locations at once.  Tonight, I was with you, Alison and Winryaa, Cole, and both Cindy and Raphael.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Raphael...that sweet girl....she&#39;s the one...wait.”  Marion paused.  “As in -the- Raphael?  The Angel?!”<br />
<br />
“The same.  Though we are nominally enemies, we have a sort of truce right now.”<br />
<br />
“My Cindy fell in love with an angel, and me a devil.  What does that say about me?”<br />
<br />
“Given what a love freak Raphael is?  That you have good taste.”<br />
<br />
They both laughed.  <br />
<br />
“Oh wait...if you were with Alison...Lee!  You were already having sex with my little girl before you asked permission!?”<br />
<br />
“Guilty as charged.  I was going to do it anyways, it&#39;s what she wanted.  But I thought you&#39;d feel better about it if I asked.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s...ooh...you&#39;re so manipulative!”<br />
<br />
“I am a Demon.”  Lee smiled.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re luck you&#39;re so damn pretty.”  Marion mock growled.  “I should spank you.”<br />
<br />
“Would you?  I think I&#39;d enjoy that.”<br />
<br />
“You would, wouldn&#39;t you?”  Marion sighed.  “Good grief.  Me and both my daughters.  I really am going to Hell.”<br />
<br />
“Not yet you&#39;re not.”  Lee pointed out.<br />
<br />
“That isn&#39;t helping...much.  You should be punished, but I guess I can&#39;t do anything to you.”<br />
<br />
“Wrong.”  Lee said.  “You&#39;re right, I took liberties with your family.  I will allow you to punish me.”<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
Lee nodded. <br />
<br />
“I should make you cook for me for the rest of my life.”  Marion said.<br />
<br />
“Not much of a punishment, I like cooking.  A strange hobby, I know.  But it pleases me when others enjoy my food.”<br />
<br />
“That meal earlier was too good to be delivery.  Did you cook it?”<br />
<br />
“Not really.  I cheated and conjured it, with Raphael&#39;s help.  Turns out she&#39;s something of a foodie herself.  It probably tasted good, but I think there&#39;s a difference.”<br />
<br />
“There is.  Food made with care is always better.”  Marion said.  “Well if that&#39;s not a punishment, hm.  I still want to spank that cute butt of yours.”<br />
<br />
“Any time you like.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
“How about...you take me out on a date?”  Marion asked.<br />
<br />
“One evening, just the two of us?  A romantic date, with no effort or expense spared?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes.  Is that a punishment?”<br />
<br />
“Not really, I think I will enjoy that too, but if that&#39;s what you want, so be it.  Do you want me to be a man?”<br />
<br />
“I...you know I&#39;m curious what you&#39;d look like as a man, but no.  I guess you could be older though, so people don&#39;t ask too many questions.”<br />
<br />
“Older...or younger?”  Lee&#39;s eyes sparkled.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Right.  Maybe?  But I can&#39;t...I can&#39;t commit to that now.  I still need to talk to my kids.  And oh God, what about Sarah?  She doesn&#39;t know about any of this!”<br />
<br />
“What if...I gave you the power to change your age?  To grow younger and back again?”  Lee offered.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Oh wow.  Any age I want?”<br />
<br />
“I presume you wouldn&#39;t want to be older.  How young would you like to be?”<br />
<br />
Marion considered that.  “I don&#39;t know...maybe a little girl, but not a toddler or a baby.”<br />
<br />
“How about this...any age from six to thirty-two.”  <br />
<br />
“I&#39;m thirty-eight, Lee.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m knocking off six years.”  The demon smiled.<br />
<br />
“Oh...uh...yes.  Yes, I&#39;d like that.  What do I have to do?”<br />
<br />
Lee took her hand.  “If you&#39;re willing, nothing.”  Then she leaned in, and bit Marion&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
A warm sensation filled Marion and she felt waves of pleasure overtake her.  The moment was brief but orgasmic, and she felt better than she had in years.  “Was that...it?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  I don&#39;t really take your soul from you, you see.  I just claim it as mine.”  Lee left a bruise on Marion&#39;s neck in the shape of a kiss.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I have to see!”  Marion got up and Lee followed her into the bathroom.  Marion turned on the light and marveled at her reflection.  “I look great!”<br />
<br />
“I thought you looked great before.”  Lee took a moment to admire Marion&#39;s backside.  The woman had wider hips and a more rounded posterior than either Sarah or Cindy.  She wasn&#39;t really a butt person, but she could admire such a feature.<br />
<br />
“So how does this work?  How do I change?”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s a spell of sorts, but a simple one.  Look into a mirror or a reflective surface, and say &#39;I want to be&#39; and whatever age.”<br />
<br />
Marion looked in the mirror.  “I want to be 18.”<br />
<br />
A shudder came over her.  She lost some weight, and her skin became softer and more taut.  Her wrinkles vanished, and her hair became fuller and more lustrous.  Her eyes seemed to brighten, and Lee noticed she gained more muscle tone.  Apparently Marion had worked out a lot more when she was a teen.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!  Look at me!”  She weighed her breasts, which had gotten smaller, and the nipples lighter.  No child had ever bit her teats, and she had never been pregnant!  She patted her stomach.  “It&#39;s so flat!  I always wanted ab muscles, but my parents freaked if I worked out too much.”<br />
<br />
“Well now you can do whatever you want.”  Lee stepped behind her, and put her arms around the smaller woman&#39;s waist.  She kissed Marion&#39;s cheek, and the girl smiled.<br />
<br />
“I changed my mind.  I want -two- dates.”<br />
<br />
“Done.  But first...don&#39;t you want to try out this body of yours?”  Lee took Marion&#39;s hand and led her back to bed.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s stamina had greatly improved, and it was nearly morning before she finally passed out in Lee&#39;s arms.</p>
