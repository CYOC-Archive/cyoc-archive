<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The warm milk has helped Devon to relax. His hard muscular body feels so weird I&#39;m his bed, and his new body hair ruffling against his PJs is annoying, but he finds himself slowly drifting off to sleep in no time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Devon began to stir as he started to have strange and vivid dreams! Unbeknownst to him, the gel that Simon had rubbed on him had now began to affect him and his body and mind began to change!<br />
<br />
<br />
Devon had a strange vision of himself slowly putting on a tight wrestling singlet over his head. he adjusted it so the tight fitting material was properly fitted on his now oddly muscular body. He adjust his soft cock, which for some reason was massive, allowing his bulge to be seen for all. Devon scratched at the thick rug of chest hair that stuck out of the top. He looked down at the thick curls and smiled. He loved having a hairy chest ever since he grew one at 14. Wait! Hairy chest? That isn&#39;t right, is it? <br />
<br />
<br />
Devon, in his dream, walked over to the mirror and flexed a bicep, which popped like a baseball. his hairy brown bush of pit hair on full display. He smirked and he took a deep whiff. Yup, stinks like BO. But what else is different! He has always been hairy and smelly! The scent made his cock twitch in his spandex singlet, slowly getting hard. Devon closed his eyes. Hairy pits too? Something wasn&#39;t right but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The scene changed again and he was in his bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He was wet, evidently from the shower. His face was covered in thick shaving foam and he was half way done with shaving his face. Some part of him felt that he was a pro at shaving, it was something he had been doing for year. Another part of him, a very alarmed part, was yelling that this wasn&#39;t normal! He didn&#39;t need to shave yet! He didn&#39;t even have peach fuzz. He brought the razor up and slowly scraped it against the thick, dark stubble. It made a satisfying SCRITCH noise. Devon felt himself get even harder, looking down past his muscular and hairy chest he could see he was tenting the towel obscenely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in the real world, Devon was tossing and turning as if he were having a nightmare. However, his body had begun to show some physical changes as well. He groaned and moaned as his cock, which was obscenely tenting his small pajama pants, throbbed even more as it slowly but surely gained a bit more length and girth. His balls ached as they also slowly gained in size, costing them selves in more and more hair as well. His soft moans dropped a bit into a baritone as his Adam&#39;s apple pushed a bit further out from his throat. Devon had begun to sweat from the changes, and his sweat had taken on a particularly foul BO to it, the scent of an unwashed teenage athlete. His armpits, which now were slowly but surely sprouting even more hair under them, were practically dripping with sweat. As of now, he now had a normal teenage sized bush under his arm, but with the amount of gel Simon had used, it wasn&#39;t going to stop there. <br />
<br />
<br />
As Devon moaned again and slowly bucked his hips upwards, slowly humping his comforter, the very first of Devon&#39;s chest hairs began to squirm out from the center of his chest and around his nipples. Thin and wispy at first, but the quickly grew very thick and dark, however they were quite sparse. For now. Likewise, his sparse treasure trail, the one Devon was do desperately embarrassed about before bed, was slowly spreading, getting thicker and darker, covering up more and more of his torso.<br />
<br />
<br />
To the outside observer, Devon now looked like your average teenage athlete. Maybe a Junior or a senior I&#39;m high school. However, Devon had only been asleep a short while and morning was still a long ways away...<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in his dream world, Devon&#39;s dream began to change again...</p>
