<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cassii, Abby, and Samantha went in search of Ulysses. They finally found him in the library straightening the books up and doing some dusting. Looking at him Cassii knew that he wasn't an adult yet but he wasn't sleeping with the pups. &quot;Ulysses, Daddy wants to see us,&quot; Samantha said getting his attention. &quot;He wants to talk about Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses sighed and came up to them. He tried to hide it but Cassii could see that he was depressed. Cassii felt sorry for him. She could tell that he loved Mary but that he couldn't have her now. Hopefully he'll be able to find someone else. He did deserve someone in his life and if she counted correctly he would have four someones. Maybe he'd love them or at least love one of them though they would have to wait until he grew older. She stopped in the middle of the hall. The wolves were locked in their forms. If the transform wasn't worded right the curse could have interpreted it to mean locking their ages too. She was sure all of them wanted to age and if they couldn't they would be miserable.<br />
<br />
'Why did you stop?' Rachael asked sensing something was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought of something about the pack's locked forms,&quot; Cassii whispered running her hand over Rachael. That was another thing. Rachael didn't disappear while she was a glass wolf even though everything else she wore disappeared. It had to have something to do with how Rachael worded her transform. Rachael had become glass like she did but she was still there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Cassii,&quot; Cindii said. &quot;They've left you behind. I don't think they even realize you're not with them anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right,&quot; Cassii said and started running to catch them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get lost?&quot; Jensen asked as Cassii came into the study.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just lost in thought Daddy,&quot; Cassii said apologizing. &quot;I was thinking about the pack's forms being locked. How was the transform worded?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have it here,&quot; Jensen said looking through some papers. &quot;I thought it best to write down the transforms we've used so we could go back to see if there were any loopholes. However Alice wrote that transform so there shouldn't be any loophole in it. Why do you want to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it wasn't worded right I fear that the pack may not age,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
Everyone froze at that for a few moments then Jensen went back to looking for that transform with an increased urgency. Finally he found it and handed it to Cassii. After a few tense moments Jensen asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot; He sounded like he was very worried.<br />
<br />
Cassii took a deep breath and said, &quot;As far as I can see there's nothing that says the pack will continue to age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen growled and punched the wall. &quot;This is a problem,&quot; he growled. &quot;This means that Bart won't be able to take over the pack if something happens to me and Kaylee. I can't believe Alice wrote a transform with a loophole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You told her to write it?&quot; Cassii asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jensen said through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What exactly did you ask of her?&quot; Cassii asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To write a transform that would lock our wolf forms,&quot; Jensen said through gritted teeth. Then he hit himself in the head and said, &quot;I should have been more specific. Now the pack won't age and it's my fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be too hard on yourself Daddy,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;No one can possibly see all the possible loopholes. It may be that the pack will age. There's nothing in this transform that says they won't age. We'll have to wait and see. I have some good news for you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What could that be?&quot; Jensen asked sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this transform says that the pack's current wolf forms are locked as they are,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;I believe that means that as long as you don't die you'll have the form you did when the transform was set.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Jensen asked looking extremely curious. &quot;Does that mean that if someone lost an eye that it will grow back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as they don't die and they had that eye at the time the transform was set then yes,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;And I'm not sure if about the dying part. It may be that the body will become like it was at the time the transform was set even after death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's one good thing,&quot; Jensen said shaking his head. &quot;We'll just have to wait and see if an eye will grow back.&quot; Jensen took a few moments then said, &quot;Now I want to know what you four know about Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean five don't you?&quot; Cindii asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Cindii,&quot; Jensen said chuckling a bit. &quot;I keep forgetting about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Cindii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you five know about Mary?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was always a good babysitter,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;She'd play with us if we asked her too. She wouldn't get angry with us if we did something we weren't suppose to. She would shake her head at us and sit us down explaining why we weren't suppose to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was almost always thinking about us first,&quot; Cindii said. &quot;Unless she had something she really needed to do she didn't get upset if she had to watch us longer than planned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was a sweet girl,&quot; Ulysses said looking down. &quot;She would help anyone if they needed it to the best of her ability. She loved animals and was going to become a vet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I notice you talk about her as if she's dead,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She might as well be,&quot; Ulysses said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulysses loves Mary,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;He doesn't believe that they can be together now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Ulysses asked looking surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that's what I'd be thinking in your position,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;And Mary's thinking the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; Ulysses asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said we took you from her,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;I think she loves you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh she does,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary would talk about Ulysses at times,&quot; Cindii said. &quot;She described how her heart would speed up and her stomach flutter when she saw him. She was even talking about marriage and wanted us to be flower girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary never said that to us,&quot; Abby said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think Mary somehow knew that we were older than what we appeared and would understand,&quot; Cassii said smiling. &quot;I think she's one of those people whose will is strong enough for her to not be totally affected by the curse. Either that or her intuition is very strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be both,&quot; Cindii said.<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed running a hand over his head. After a moment he asked, &quot;Do any of you think that she could influence her parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She could influence them to a certain extent,&quot; Cindii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much?&quot; Jensen wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as any child has influence on normal parents,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;And by normal parents I mean those parents who are parents. Not those who strive to be their child's friend and let the child wrap them around their little fingers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen had to chuckle at that. He knew what Cassii was talking about since he had been able to wrap his parents around his little fingers when he was Jennifer. They had never said no to him then. Part of that must have been their treating him like a child. Maybe that's part of the reason he made his parents his children. To raise them and show them what a parent should be. Of course Kaylee was doing a great job of that. And that may not end now. He sighed and shook his head. They needed to stop using the curse since it seemed that it was coming back to bite them even when they thought it wasn't if Cassii was right about the transform to lock their wolf forms. He looked at all five of them and said, &quot;You five will be the pack's diplomats to the pride. Cassii, Cindii, you two will also be the pack's diplomats to Madam Serenity and the police. I'm trusting you to do this job well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't you get someone else to do this?&quot; Ulysses asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;All five of you know Mary,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;From what you said she'll be the best diplomat to the pack. At least for now. Now Ulysses I need to say something to you. You'll have to face justice for breaking and entering and attempted kidnapping. You won't be alone as most of the pack will have to face justice for kidnapping as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the cat if it still lives?&quot; Ulysses asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What cat?&quot; Cassii asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Serenity's cat,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;It came into our mansion and even into the pup's room. It was at the Hardy's and maimed one of the pack. From what I was told it was a force to be reckoned with. According to those who witnessed it the cat was sure to die from deep claw marks and being thrown against a wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go see Trevor,&quot; Cassii said with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Jensen asked. &quot;I would think it's dead since it wasn't with Madam Serenity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Trevor lived,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;His transform said that he'd live for twenty years and if I'm right it's only been two years.&quot; Something came to her mind then and she said, &quot;You know Trevor Daddy. He said he was close to the top of your list when you were Jennifer before his transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen had to think back a bit. He did remember a boy named Trevor who was pretty hot. Three years ago he disappeared and no one knew what happened to him. His family was still in town so he didn't move away. Most people thought that he had run away for some odd reason. Others thought that he met with an ill fate. Well if it's the same one then he did meet an ill fate though not like they had thought. &quot;I remember Trevor,&quot; he said after a bit. &quot;Go ahead and go to him. If he's still alive tell him that I'm sorry and he was at the top of my list when he disappeared. He's at the police station still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Daddy,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;I think I'll drop my bags off in the mirror world pup bedroom before I go. Speaking of that I think another bed needs to be placed in there. I may not always be in this form and another bed would be nice. Maybe two other beds since I think Ulysses should be in there too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you're right about that,&quot; Jensen said looking Ulysses up and down. &quot;Ulysses, from now on you'll be sleeping with the pups seeing as you're still a pup yourself. I know you're the only one your age here. It must be a little lonely for you. Have you made any friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I might have with one of the females,&quot; Ulysses said being vague.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's something more than friendship,&quot; Jensen said nodding.<br />
<br />
Ulysses blushed under his fur and said, &quot;I think of her as a big sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;We're a family here but some of us seem to be becoming genetic family. I think the color of our fur reflects that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So families have the same color fur?&quot; Ulysses asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
'If that's true then Sarah is my big sister,' Ulysses mused. 'What does that say about Nick and Nicole though? They both have gray fur Nick's just being darker. Are they committing incest?'<br />
<br />
&quot;Well get going Cassii,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;I'll make sure that two beds are moved into the pup's room even if I have to do it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You rest Daddy,&quot; Cassii said looking pointedly at Jensen's bandaged leg. &quot;Auntie Julie will be upset if you try to move beds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen chuckled and said, &quot;Alright I'll take it easy. But I have to wonder if you should be resting too. You were shattered two times today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii had to think that over a bit. She did take longer to reform the second time. She should probably rest. &quot;I'll rest after I see Trevor,&quot; she said nodding. &quot;I did take longer to reform the second time and I do feel a little slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll hold you to that young lady,&quot; Jensen said firmly. &quot;Now go before I change my mind and have you rest without going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii said, &quot;Ok Daddy,&quot; and ran out of the room. Once she got to the pup's room she climbed on the vanity and entered the mirror. When she was putting her bags down she suddenly realized that the pup's room was familiar. It had been Jennifer's room before. She looked at the mirror closet and wondered if the outfits Jennifer had her in when she was Rick were in there. She smiled remembering those times. She didn't mind dressing up as a cheerleader nor doing the cheers. In fact she had fun doing it. Jennifer had laughed herself silly during those times and so had she. She smiled as she took the three steps to the police station.<br />
<br />
It took her a couple tries but Cassii did find where Trevor and Madam Serenity were. She was about to step out of the mirror when Trevor meowed in pain and said, ~Stupid dogs. At least I bought the Hardys time to be transformed. We might have been kidnapped otherwise.~ Cassii knew that Trevor was speaking in felidae with Madam Serenity right there. The only time he had done that was when she was around since she was the only one that Trevor became friends with.<br />
<br />
Cassii decided that it would be better if she came out another mirror and shifted to her human form. Even though Trevor knew about her wolf forms she thought it best not to be a wolf around him right now. It might upset him and cause him to injure himself. Once outside she concentrated and watched as she changed. Her feet resumed a human shape as her thighs elongated. Her tail melted into her spine until it was gone. Her ears moved down and rounded out becoming human ears. Her muzzle flattened into her face until her human face appeared. Her claws shrank and became her nails. Then the final part of the transformation happened. She became flesh and blood and her clothes appeared on her. She walked around the corner and said, &quot;Hi Madam Serenity, Trevor,&quot; while waving and smiling.<br />
<br />
Trevor smiled as best he could and said, ~It's very good to see you Cassii. I was starting to think you had forgotten about me.~<br />
<br />
&quot;I could never forget you Trevor,&quot; Cassii said with a smile. Switching to felidae she said, ~We are friends after all. You haven't noticed that you're speaking felidae have you?~<br />
<br />
Trevor sighed and said, ~No I didn't. I'm still glad to see you though.~<br />
<br />
&quot;Cassii, why are you in you're human form?&quot; Madam Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it best not to upset Trevor,&quot; Cassii said looking at Trevor's bandages.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Madam Serenity said nodding. &quot;Oh this orangutan is Paul. Paul this is Cassii.&quot;<br />
<br />
~Hello Paul,~ Cassii said curtsying. ~It's a pleasure to meet you.~<br />
<br />
Paul looked stunned for several moments then said, ~I understood you.~<br />
<br />
Cassii frowned and said, ~A victim of the curse I presume.~<br />
<br />
~You must be too in order to communicate with me like this,~ Paul said nodding.<br />
<br />
~Can't be a victim if you willing let yourself be transformed,~ Cassii said with a smile at the end.<br />
<br />
Paul was shocked beyond words. Here this girl was saying that she allowed herself to be transformed by the curse and seeming happy about it. Surely she had to be joking. Madam Serenity saw his look and chuckled a bit before saying, &quot;I can guess what you told him. Though I think you've just about gave him a heart attack saying you were willingly transformed. Though he shouldn't be all that surprised since he had the idea of using the curse to create a counter force to the pack from those that were willing to do it. You see he was a priest before his transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Cassii said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you come to see Gill about your foster parents molesting you?&quot; Madam Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
~WHAT,~ Trevor and Paul shouted at the same time.<br />
<br />
Cassii knew that they understood English even if they couldn't speak it so she said, &quot;It's true. My foster parents molested me over the past three days.&quot;<br />
<br />
~What an evil act to perform on a child,~ Paul said fury hidden just underneath his words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah a priest who knows it's evil,&quot; Cassii said smiling. &quot;I'm glad to meet one.&quot;<br />
<br />
~Most priests are not like that,~ Paul said outraged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;It's just that the news makes it look like all priests are guilty of molesting children. And it seems that those in the upper hierarchy of the church don't see anything wrong with it. I'm sure there are those like you Paul but I'm just going by what I see. I didn't mean any disrespect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul sighed and said, ~I'm sorry too. I just don't like people attacking my faith.~<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't attack your faith,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;I attacked those priests that molest children. It has nothing to do with faith. In fact I think those priest that molest children have no faith at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
~I would have to agree with you on that,~ Paul said. ~They don't deserve to be called priests. So are you here for that?~<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to talk will Gill later but it's too soon for me to be here,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
~Why is that?~ Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you see I can travel through mirrors and my foster parents live a long way from here,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;I haven't told them about what I can do nor many other people so it would ordinarily take me awhile to get here running away.&quot;<br />
<br />
~So why are you here?~ Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why to see you of course Trevor,&quot; Cassii said smiling a bit.<br />
<br />
~I suppose Madam Serenity told you about my injuries,~ Trevor said.<br />
<br />
Cassii looked at Madam Serenity and Paul and said, &quot;Sorry but I think Trevor and I should talk in private so I'll be speaking in felidae. I don't mean to cut you out but there are a few things which Trevor might want to keep confidential.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
~You are a true friend to him,~ Paul said.<br />
<br />
Cassii nodded then switched to felidae and said, ~I heard about your injuries from Jensen.~<br />
<br />
~How is he?~ Trevor asked looking concerned.<br />
<br />
~He's good,~ Cassii said. ~He told me to tell you that you were on top of his list before you disappeared.~<br />
<br />
Trevor lowered his head and sighed saying, ~Well I can die now I know that.~<br />
<br />
~Oh don't be so melodramatic,~ Cassii said waving it off.<br />
<br />
~I'm not being melodramatic,~ Trevor said shaking his head. ~I should be dead now. If it wasn't for Mary I would be.~ Cassii looked guilty and Trevor had to ask, ~What is it?~<br />
<br />
~Well...~ Cassii began. She didn't really know how to tell Trevor that he couldn't die. She knew that a cat had attacked Mr. P when he had Trevor treed. Several had said they saw both of them together and figured that they were a pair. The ferocity that the one who attacked Mr. P with seemed to bear that out.<br />
<br />
~What is it?~ Trevor asked anxiously.<br />
<br />
~I hope that this won't upset you,~ Cassii said.<br />
<br />
~Spit it out already,~ Trevor demanded.<br />
<br />
~You remember the terms of your transform?~ Cassii asked.<br />
<br />
~I could hardly forget it,~ Trevor said bitterly.<br />
<br />
~You were told you'd live for twenty years,~ Cassii said.<br />
<br />
~I know,~ Trevor said rolling his eyes. ~I have the lifespan of a normal cat. I don't see why you're being so evasive about this though.~<br />
<br />
~It isn't that you have the lifespan of a normal cat,~ Cassii said. ~Until those twenty years are up you can't die and you've only gone through three of those years.~<br />
<br />
~What do you mean I can't die?~ Trevor asked slowly.<br />
<br />
~I mean you can't die,~ Cassii said. ~If I cut your head off, took out your heart, put you in a grinder, and cremated you you'd still be alive. The only time you'll die is in another seventeen years.~<br />
<br />
~I can't die,~ Trevor said slowly. ~Then that means Queen died for nothing. She wanted kittens by me and she attacked that big wolf that had me treed to protect me. The only selfless thing she probably did in her whole life and she died doing it. The worst part is that she didn't need to save me. She died for nothing.~<br />
<br />
~Did she really die for nothing?~ Cassii asked.<br />
<br />
~YES SHE DID,~ Trevor shouted followed by him throwing himself around. ~SHE DIED FOR NOTHING BECAUSE I CAN'T DIE.~<br />
<br />
Cassii grabbed Trevor gently trying to prevent him from hurting himself. ~Try to calm down Trevor or you'll hurt yourself,~ she said trying to sooth him.<br />
<br />
~I can't die so it doesn't matter,~ Trevor said sadness evident in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong with Trevor?&quot; Madam Serenity asked. She saw that blood was getting on Cassii's dress and said, &quot;We need to get him to a vet or he's going to die he's bleeding so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let him bleed out,&quot; Cassii said holding Trevor in her lap.<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity and Paul were absolutely shocked. Madam Serenity found her voice first and said, &quot;But Trevor will die if he keeps thrashing around like that and bleeding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii shook her head sadly and said, &quot;He can't die for another seventeen years no matter what. That's part of his transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul shook his head sadly while Madam Serenity said, &quot;Oh the poor dear. I take it you didn't think he'd take it this hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii shook her head sadly as she watched Trevor thrash about and bleed. Soon he would grow tired and wouldn't be thrashing about as much. She hadn't expected him to react like this but she should have after hearing what the others had said about the two cats at the manor. &quot;Maybe he'll see Queen when he bleeds out even though he can't die,&quot; she said with a sad sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Madam Serenity allowed as Trevor's thrashing started to grow weak.</p>
