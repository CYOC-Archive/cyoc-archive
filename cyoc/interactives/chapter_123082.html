<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Immediately after Jeff started the change, Mike felt a tingling through his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? I think I just felt something, is this supposed to happen?&quot; Mike asked, concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you should feel a tingling, it means the changes are starting. I know this is a bit awkward, dad, but you might want to take all your clothes off for this change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike was intrigued by Jeff&#39;s suggestion. &quot;Jeff, what are you turning me into? It seems like it&#39;s going to be quite involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still a secret dad, but you&#39;ll find out soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Mike obliged, removing his shirt and pants and pulling down his boxers to reveal his naked body. As he examined himself, he noticed a subtle difference. Some light-colored hairs had appeared in his pubic hair and in the middle of his chest, and as he watched, more light hairs started to grow out. His own dark body hair began to lighten, and some of the hairs grew longer as well. Moving a hand over his body, he felt the hair become denser and thicker, the texture changing under his fingers. However, Mike noted that his fingernails looked odd, looking darker and pointier. He quickly checked his toenails, and found that they had undergone similar changes.<br />
<br />
Mike wondered to himself what he could possibly be changing into, if he was growing more hair and his nails were changing. &quot;Jeff, let me guess, am I turning into an animal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right dad, but I&#39;ll leave you to figure out which one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike continued to watch the changes, observing the light-coloured, nearly-white hair - rather, fur - that was spreading up from his crotch and outwards from his chest. Shorter whitish hairs also began to sprout on his forearms and legs, and the arm and leg hair that he had also began to lighten. Mike felt a cracking in his feet as the bones began to shift. Mike sat down, placing his legs in front of him. The off-white hairs continued to spread across his legs and even his feet, which shifted in structure to accommodate a new digitigrade stance. <br />
<br />
Mike grabbed one of his feet with his hands, feeling as a rough pad began to grow near the front of the sole and similar pads grew on the bottoms of his changing toes. His big toes shrunk in size and disappeared, while the other toes shifted, the central two toes on each foot becoming larger than the other two. His nails had darkened and shifted to the front of each toe, forming claws. Short white hairs grew to envelop both his feet and cover even the undersurfaces except where the pads were. Oddly enough, despite all the cracking bones, Mike didn&#39;t feel any pain. In fact, it actually felt rather good. His feet were now unmistakably paws - but which animal they belonged to was what Mike wanted to figure out.<br />
<br />
The changes moved up his legs and to his thighs, where more light hairs began to grow on his thigh, but Mike noticed that on the outsides of his thighs, the hairs were more of a light brown than a dirty white. Beneath the growing fur, his formerly flabby legs began to become more defined, the muscles growing larger and more powerful as the fat started to melt away. The bones shifted and changed in proportion to become proper hindlegs while remaining strong enough to support his body and muscles. The process of his legs shifting was painless, but again, it somehow felt good, almost slightly pleasurable. As Mike attempted to stand up, he realized that he now had to put his weight on his toes instead. Although he had some difficulty balancing at first, he managed to stand on his new paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, these are definitely the hindlegs of an animal with paws, but which one?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, wait and see,&quot; Jeff replied, &quot;But I think you should be able to tell soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
A cracking in Mike&#39;s hands signaled the start of the next major change. Mike brought his hands closer and watched as his palms began to lengthen, the proportions shifting as his hands changed to resemble his new paw feet closely. Rough dark pads grew from the surfaces of his palms and the undersides of his fingers. His thumb shrank, but it did not disappear, instead forming a dewclaw. The white fur enveloped his former hands, and the bone structure shifted, rendering his hands useless for manipulating objects but adept for walking on. It would be hard for Mike to pick up or use things with his paws, but he supposed that was part of the life of being an animal and it could be fun trying to figure out how to get around it.<br />
<br />
Just as Mike&#39;s legs had changed, his arms followed suit, more light fur growing and spreading up his arms, with a light brown color on the outside. His arms grew more muscular, and again the bones shifted as they adjusted to become forelegs, sturdier and more capable of supporting his weight. By now, Mike&#39;s limbs and the front of his body were mostly covered in thick white fur, and although he could not see it, more hairs were growing in on his back, thickening into long fur.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to give Mike a hint about his change. &quot;Hey dad, you&#39;ve probably noticed how warm it&#39;s getting. You should look in the mirror. You&#39;ll probably be able to guess from what you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike moved over to the mirror, examining his strange form with animal legs and a fur-covered human body. As Mike turned to his side, he noticed the thick fur growing out of his back. Unlike the front, the fur on his back was mostly a pretty dark gray. Near his sides, it was a light brown, which blended with the light creamy hairs on his front. Mike finally realized what he was turning into.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it now, Jeff! I&#39;m turning into a wolf, ain&#39;t I?&quot; exclaimed Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right dad. I hope you&#39;ll enjoy the rest of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike felt a popping near the top of his butt, followed by a strange pushing sensation as a fur-covered appendage pushed its way out. Mike realized that it was his new tail. He found that with some thought, he could move his tail about. It grew rather large, comparable in size to his hind legs, fluff and all. <br />
<br />
An intense warmth began to concentrate in his crotch. Mike looked down to face a growing boner. Slightly embarrassed at having an erection in front of his son, Mike turned away slightly to hide it from Jeff&#39;s view, but noticed that his dick was changing. He watched as it began to grow larger and redder, as furry skin began to grow up towards his dick, enveloping it in a sheath. His balls, covered by pale fur, grew slightly larger. The head of his dick sharpened into a point, becoming continuous with the rest of his pink, throbbing shaft. Mike tried to touch his dick, but his front paws provided limited dexterity. Even then, as alien as his dick seemed now, the sensation of his paw gently brushing its surface only confirmed that this was real. Mike noticed part of his dick near the base swelling, forming a canine knot. Eventually, the building arousal and pleasure from his touch was too much for Mike. He shuddered as he came forcefully, spraying out the last of his human sperm as his balls started to produce wolf sperm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I&#39;m sorry Jeff, I didn&#39;t mean to make that mess, I promise I&#39;ll clean that up,&quot; Mike apologized, his face red with embarrassment after he realized what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, it&#39;s alright dad, I know you didn&#39;t mean it. I&#39;ll go clean it up, I don&#39;t think it will be convenient for you, not with your paws it won&#39;t.&quot; Jeff quickly ran to grab some tissue and wiped up his dad&#39;s cum, as awkward as it was. He&#39;d checked off the pleasurable transformation option to try and make it more enjoyable for his dad, but didn&#39;t expect it to be this pleasurable... he just hoped that this was the worst of it.<br />
<br />
Now, Mike&#39;s body began to shift, and he felt some popping along his back as his spine changed. Mike got on all fours as his former shoulders reconfigured themselves for a quadrupedal stance. His chest narrowed, but pushed itself outward, while his torso grew more muscular and his former fat belly shrank away. The fur around his neck grew thicker and longer, as his neck thickened with muscle and its alignment shifted to keep his head facing forward. <br />
<br />
Mike was now fully a wolf from the neck down. It was amazing to have watched the changes so far, and Mike tried to express this, but found that he had already lost his human voice. As the changes progressed towards his head, Mike watched in the mirror as the hair on his head was replaced by dark gray fur, while his trimmed beard turned into white fur like his belly. His ears reshaped, and moved upwards along his head as they too grew a layer of shorter fur. He felt his face begin to push out into a snout, the teeth sharpening and his nose turning black and more sensitive. His pink lips turned black as well, as the fur spread across the rest of his face. The area around his eyes and above his nose were covered by light brown fur. His eyes turned yellow as the rest of the changes to his face completed, removing the last vestige of his human appearance. Mike felt a sudden rush in his head, as he gained the instincts he would need as a wolf. His changes finally complete, Mike let out a howl just as the Chronivac beeped to signal the end of the transformation. Mike was looking forward to trying out his new body, and to feeling the freedom and power of being a wolf.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked over his dad, now a gray wolf indistinguishable from any other. He was a little nervous, as this was the most drastic change he had tried so far with the Chronivac, and he wasn&#39;t sure if his dad was still mentally in control, or if he had become a potentially dangerous feral wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, if it&#39;s still you in there, wag your tail three times,&quot; Jeff asked, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Mike happily obliged and wagged his tail. It felt almost natural to him now. Jeff was relieved by this sight, knowing that both he and his dad were safe. Now, Jeff was stuck in a dilemma. He knew he should probably bring his dad to the forest so that he could enjoy being a wolf, but should he use the Chronivac on himself first?</p>
