<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scarlette nervously watched herself, not knowing where this next change would occour. From Skye&#39;s new set of eyes, she assumed she would gain more too, but as Skye&#39;s next set opened up on her forehead (giving her three sets), nothing had happened.<br />
&quot;Maybe its not working on mhfhfhhh....&quot;<br />
Scarlettes words were cut short as a deep pressure pushed up her throat. Scarlette flailed around as it came to rest in her mouth and slowly parted her lips: an eyeball, big enough to fill her mouth, with her crystal blue tone pushed outwards, the sudden rush of extra vision causing her to lose balance and fall on her butt.<br />
once the new addition had fully pushed into view, Scarlette felt the muscles in her lips shift and change, the tingling sensation slowly fading. her lips didnt open or close the same way anymore, but rather, the blinked; a strange sensation indeed, almost like rapidly kissing something.<br />
but the change wasnt over yet, the tingling then moved down lower, like a wave, as it passed her breasts, her nipples slowly stretched opened revealing an eye in each, squinting at the new sensitivity to light, Scarlette tried to steady herself on a nearby bar stool and noticed Skye do the same as a long line of eyes opened down her back, following her spine, neck to hips.<br />
Skye stood up straight, and looking at Scarlette through a myriad of eyes asked &quot;you ok Scar?&quot;<br />
Scarlette gave a thumbs up and made her way over to Skye, who had a long line forming across her stomach. knowing what was about to happen, Scarlette pointed down at it. &quot;What are you pointing tooooooooooooo....&quot; Skye leaned back as the split opened up into a massive eye, the size of a basketball, long eyelashes tickling the underside of her breasts.<br />
if Scarlette could move her lips, she would be laughing her ass off. suddenly with a quick force, Scarlette went bow legged as the tingle moved to her nethers, all of her eyes growing wide as another eye pushed its way out of her pussy, and once formed her labia formed the eyelid, each blink sending waves of pleasure through her body.<br />
<br />
with their transformations finally over, Skye and Scarlette eyed each other off. Scarlette was so turned on, mostly in part to her pussy blinking nearly uncontrollably, all of her eyes casting over Skyes body.<br />
&quot;hey Scar, its rude to stare&quot; Skye joked as she grabbed Scarlettes hand and led her over to a nearby lounge.<br />
&quot;hey i know this is crazy but want to take a selfie?&quot; Skye joked.<br />
Scarlette gave the thumbs up, she wanted something to remember this by, and with all eyes on the camera, took a shot.<br />
&quot;not bad, but i think it would be too hard to stop all our eyes from blinking&quot;<br />
<br />
For the next hour or so the two ladies just lounged around, taking in all the surroundings, it was crazy what an over abundance of sight could do, Skye even catching Freeze perving on them with the eyes on her back.<br />
&quot;I may not have eyes in the back of my head, but i can still see you Freeze&quot; Skye quipped, blushing slightly.<br />
For Scarlette it wasnt all about taking in the sights, the sensitive flesh in her nipple and pussy lids, driving her crazy with arousal.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the pleasure came to an end as her pussy closed shut but didnt reopen, the felling of the eye receding telling her it was wearing off, and as her mouth eye pushed back down her throat it felt like she was trying to swallow a tennis ball until it melted away leaving her back to her old self.<br />
&quot;well thats number two out of the way&quot; Scarlette said as Skyes last set of eyes blinked away.<br />
&quot;its not my favorite, but its definately not the worst&quot;<br />
Scarlette looked puzzled. &quot;Which one is the worst?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sound&quot; Skye said, almost annoyed.<br />
&quot;why?&quot;<br />
&quot;i dont know, its just like being in a crowded room, kinda makes to feel anxious i guess&quot; And with that, Skyes mouth sealed up. Scarlette placed her hands on her hips and asked &quot;which one could this be?&quot; then suddenly realised her hands were stuck, she looked at them and they were gone, her arms connected to her hips at the wrist. &quot;what the?&quot; Scarlette tugged them but they were stuck fast, the tingling was back, and this time it was running up her sides.<br />
Scarlette looked to Skye and gasped: Skyes face was gone, her head flattening out and stretching horizontally and vertically until it was a large oval shape, cartilage and skin flowing across it like a wave and setting into shape. then with an audible &#39;POP&#39; a hole appeared in the bottom as a large flap of skin grew down into her new earlobe.<br />
<br />
Scarlette was glad she still had her face intact, she was getting a little annoyed at losing her vocal chords each time.<br />
She then looked down at what was left of her arms, the gap between her arms and torso filling out with a thin layer of flesh until they too popped open into new ears, flanking both sides of her body. &quot;well i guess thats the trade off&quot; Scarlette said, when she tried to move her arms it just made her new ears wiggle, tickling herself.<br />
<br />
Freeze was still perving from the confines of the bar and muttered under his breath &quot;damn these girls make it sexy, even if its just ears&quot;<br />
&quot;i heard that&quot; Scarlette called out, immediately regretting the sound as she doubled over from the sensation, Skye, using her whole fist to block the massive ear hole in the middle of where her head would be.<br />
&quot;hey Skye, we should totally get our ears pierced&quot; Scarlette joked. Skye replying by flicking Scarlettes left ear.<br />
&quot;ok maybe a bad idea&quot; Scarlette said, picturing the size of rings theyd need to fit.<br />
After what felt like an age, Scarlette felt her ears start to recede, her half formed arms flapping in the breeze.<br />
&quot;mhmmfmm...ever do that again&quot; Skye said, her mouth still reforming.<br />
&quot;we totally should have played hide and seek&quot;<br />
&quot;well lets hope there isnt a next time, i swear if he does that again ill turn him into a dildo&quot;<br />
&quot;putting him too good use aye?&quot; Scarlette joked, Skyes face once again turning bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;well it looks like the next change is underway&quot; Skye said<br />
&quot;how can you tell?&quot;<br />
Skye pointed at Scarlettes head &quot;well hun, for one thing...youre not blushing, but your face is still red&quot;</p>
