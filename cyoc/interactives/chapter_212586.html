<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“The bar sounds good,” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
Zach and Michael nodded, and the three boys headed into the crowds and glamour of the island in search of one.<br />
<br />
Despite the crowds, it didn’t take them long to find a bar. The three boys all walked into it, finding it virtually empty. Zach and Michael led Jeremy to a booth, where they all sat down.<br />
<br />
“They’re going to kick us out,” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
“Just stay cool,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
A young woman with long yellow, blond hair that streamed over her shoulders approached the table. She wore a black tank top that exposed her midriff, showing off tanned skin. Her black skirt left her well-shaped legs open for the world to see. She smiled at the boys, Jeremy noticed her teeth were perfect. He wished he were older so he could ask her out. The lad didn’t stop to consider where that thought came from, it was one that was far from normal for him.<br />
<br />
“Would you three gentlemen like some beer?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Her voice was pleasant, almost too pleasant. It was as though she were singing the question.<br />
<br />
The three boys stammered as though unsure how to respond to the lady.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we won’t ask for ID. Everything is of course, on the house. We want you all to have the time of your lives. Let go, have fun and go wild,” she said.<br />
<br />
Zach and Michael smiled at her and Jeremy found himself doing the same.<br />
<br />
“We’ll have a pitcher and three glasses,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
“Coming right up,” the woman said.<br />
<br />
She walked off and the boys all looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“Man, I wish we were older; just like her” Michael said.<br />
<br />
“Man, I wish I was too.  She was kinda cute,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy simply smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
The woman returned a few minutes later with a pitcher and three glasses. She put it on the table, smiled and told them to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Zach filled each of the glasses before handing them to Michael and Jeremy. Jeremy watched his companion&#39;s drink. Their expression was of curiosity and then surprise. They put the glasses down when they’d drunk half of them, and both looked at Jeremy.<br />
<br />
“Give it a try, it’s not so bad,” Zach said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy picked up his glass and brought it up to his mouth. The smell of the beverage was alien to his nostrils and he felt the fizz tickle his lips. He hoped that he wouldn’t like it and/or it would make him ill, then at least he’d have an excuse for not drinking any more. He drank down a small amount and swished it in his mouth for a while. Much to his surprise, it actually didn’t taste half-bad.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” Jeremy said after swallowing.<br />
<br />
“Well?” Zach asked.<br />
<br />
Jeremy felt something strange. Any worries he had over drinking it were vanishing. Nodding his head, he drank down more. He kept drinking until his glass was empty. Putting it down, he smiled.<br />
<br />
“That was actually pretty good,” Jeremy said. Instead of feeling ashamed, Jeremy actually felt good! He was already starting to feel a mild buzz and he wanted more. He poured himself another glass and started drinking it.<br />
<br />
“What did I tell ya?” Zach said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy finished that glass, and a thought crossed his mind. He wanted to go to that beach. The idea that someone could catch him worried him a bit but if he was going to go this far, he might as well have gone the entire way. Besides, he knew he’d get into trouble for all of this eventually; from the lad’s point of view, he might as well make it worth it.<br />
<br />
“I wanna go to the beach,” Jeremy said. He’d already stood up before the others could respond. <br />
<br />
Looking at Jeremy, Michael noticed he was oddly...taller. And a bit...broader shouldered. Perhaps more Muscular. He shook his head, trying to settle his thoughts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me down this thing and I&#39;m right behind you!&quot; Zach replied brushing a lock of hair from his eyes with a grin. Given the buzz setting in, he hardly noticed how odd it was that his once short kinky hair was in his eyes. <br />
<br />
Downing his drink, he caught a glimpse of Michael doing the same, his hair seemingly longer than before.  With each gulp Michaels ears seemed to lengthen. Inch by inch grew and melded shape, flicking in midair as a light coating of baby blue fur sprouted from the skin. <br />
<br />
With a satisfied clink of his glass on the counter, Michael stood, ears flicking, ready to join the others. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready guys?&quot; Asked Jeremy, his voice cracking an octave lower midsentence. <br />
<br />
Turning to his friend, Michael was again surprised at how much taller Jeremy was, and how he was now taller than himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;When&#39;d you get so tall&quot; Michael said with a slight slur.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about short stuff?&quot; Jeremy replied, dismissing the question with little contemplation as he turned to start towards the beach. Behind him, a hold opened up in his shorts as a dark brown tufted tail began to snake down from his spine, flicking in the air behind him as his gluts seemed to visibly firm and tighten below it, stength and raw mass increasing with each step. <br />
<br />
Michael was  confused. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t have tails....w-what was in that beer?&quot; He muttered allowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to blue boy...you Coming? &quot; Zach asked<br />
<br />
 Shaking his head as the excitement quickly overtook his confusion.  &quot;Uh...yea...lets!&quot; Michael replied, glancing over at his friend. <br />
<br />
<br />
As Michael followed Jeremy out, Zach followed. As they walked the confusion seemed to pass to Zach. He brushed a lock of his ever-lengthening hair from his eyes. Once kinky and dark brown, the texture had smoothed growing straight and silky. The color too began to shift to a dark pink, a striking contrast to his mocha skin. His ears began to sterch skyward, lengthening into donkey points while a peppering of bright pink fur dusted their skin. <br />
<br />
From there, the fur began to quickly travel down his neck and across his arms and down his torso. Inch by inch, his dark skin was replaced by the sharp contrast of the light, feminine pink of his fur. As it traveled, an electric, and pleasurable tickle raced up his spine causing him to emit a small, feminine giggle. The pitch was far higher than normal, though one that befitted his increasingly pick form. <br />
<br />
As he followed Michael, Zach admired his friend&#39;s form from beind....something he&#39;d never done before. With each step, it seemed to sway. Michaels movements were almost hypnotic, each step smooth and graceful. Gone was the somewhere clumsy masculine stomping that once characterizes Michael&#39;s gait. <br />
<br />
With each step, Michael&#39;s figure seemed to melt and smooth, almost matching the timbre of his gait.  His midrif slowly pinched inwards creating a curve that gracefully sloped out at his somewhat fuller hips. As a blue tail began to snake out of Michael&#39;s spine, Zach found himself unable to look away, an odd warmth filling him as a dopey grin crossed his face. As he eyed his friend, Zach hardly noticed that his fingers started to meld, four shifting into three as hooflike caps emerged from their tips. From below, the soft pad of his human feet steadly turned into an audible clopping. At the end of his now shapely legs, sat a pair of pink feathered hooves. <br />
<br />
As he ran out into the warm sunny day, Jeremy felt a little strange again. He was starting to develop quite a buzz. Any worry that he’d get into trouble was quickly fading. This was already too much fun too worry about that!<br />
<br />
Jeremy ran through the thick crowds that croweded the boardwalk laughing all the way. He felt great and didn’t want the sensation to go away. He would normally never sneak into the girl’s locker room or anything like that. Now, on an island where anything went and there was little if any worry of getting into trouble, Jeremy felt freer then he had in a long time.<br />
<br />
As he thought about the lockerroom at the beach, he felt a strange sensation over his rear end. Something brushed against the back of his pants. He shrugged it off even as he felt a breeze somehow touching something behind his rear end too high to be his legs.<br />
<br />
Jeremy just laughed off the sensation and kept running through the crowds. It found it odd that everyone in the crowd seemed shorter than him, and many were sporting what looked like donkey costumes. He ignored all this, however, as the thought of the clothing optional beach and perhaps sneaking into the women&#39;s locker room for a peep filled his head. Pressing through the crowd with a unique ease, something afforded to him by his now well-defined musculature, he aimed to get to that beach and see the things society would never allow his eyes to see at his age.<br />
<br />
“This place is hawwesome!” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
Why he was letting go so easily, he didn’t know. It felt great doing so, as though as long as here were here, he could act however he wanted. He felt like there was an animal inside of him just waiting to get out. This animal was untamed, perhaps a beast but free of human rules, regulations and the inhibitions that Jeremy now knew had kept him at bay for a long time.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna be free!” Jeremy yelled as he slicked back his mohawk-like mane of hair that gradually shifted from blond to a dark brown. He didn’t care thatothers around him looked at him with worried expressions on their faces.<br />
<br />
As he broke into a run, his skin felt itchy, and his clothes seemed tighter. Dark black fur peppered his thickening pecs and highlighted the abs that were shedding fat and pressing out into a six pack. Scratching at his chin he was surprised to feel hair! Was he growing a beard already? Growing a beard meant he was truly becoming a man; not in a boring mature adult way but in a way that meant he could get away with doing things only adults could do! the hair under his chin was brown, unlike his under coat, and ever so slightly longer separating his beard from his fur. Putting his hand to his face, he felt his beard with his three fingered hoof-capped hands, enjoying the feel without noticing the dulled sensation of his hoof tipped fingers. <br />
<br />
As he neared the beach, he began to notice his strength. Somehow he felt stronger, more powerful, thicker and full. Jeremy looked at his arms only to see that his once tiny muscles were now almost bulging. Not only that but his arms, once only covered in a thin layer of light hair now had a much thicker coating of dark brown hair! Was he going through puberty this fast? Jeremy liked the idea of being one of the only, if not the only kid in his grade with body hair and muscles to boost. He didn’t care that the changes were seemingly impossible. He was too thrilled with them to worry about silly little things like possible and impossible.<br />
<br />
“This is so freaking cool!” Jeremy said. He noticed that even his voice sounded deeper!<br />
<br />
His buzz was starting to wear off. Jeremy saw a vendor seem to appear out of nowhere. No, Jeremy was just too distracted by these awesome changes to his body to notice! He ran right over to the vendor, a huge grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Hey mister, can I have some more beer?” Jeremy asked. <br />
<br />
The man, a bearded donkey in his late thirties wearing a pinstriped shirt and pants, beamed at Jeremy.<br />
<br />
“But of course, young man. I see you’re becoming quite the man here!”<br />
<br />
“Yep,” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
The man poured Jeremy a glass of beer and handed it to him. Jeremy felt something swishing behind him. He knew he should have found it odd and investigated. However, he was feeling too exhilarated. Before he did anything else, he gulped down the beer, with each chug his face lengthened. Tipping the last sip down his muzzle, he set the glass down hard on the stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;HAWWWWWWWWW&quot; he moaned, eyes glazed over from the buzz, thickly muscled torso heaving, and long donkey Tonge lulling from his maw. <br />
<br />
Adjusting his crotch, he smiled in contentment as the buzz danced across his mind. He felt strong. Good. And ...something else, there was a need, a...warmth he couldn&#39;t quite describe. He adjusted his crotch once more. <br />
<br />
&quot;There you are!&quot; came a high, feminine voice. Looking up he saw a pair of anthro donkey&#39;s, one baby blue and the other pink. Both sported Curvey androgenous yet still male frames that would be better paired with two women, rather than the friends he&#39;d arrived with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jeremey replied, confused. He was about to ask who they were when he inhaled, their combined scents entering his nostrils telling his subconscious this was Michael and Zach. Without thought, he accepted this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to hit the beach?&quot; asked Michael<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh..y-haww-yea&quot; Replied Jeremey, blinking as he tried to collect his confused thoughts and fight through the buzz. Straightening from his hunched posture, Jeremey stretched and flexed his arms upward. His pecs heaved, abs poked through his now skintight shirt and upon flexing, his biceps practically exploded from his black furred hide. <br />
<br />
Zach was practically awestruck at this display. There was something...undeniably captivating about his friend. Primal, alluring, desirable. He loved the way the fur framed each sinew and accented Jeremy&#39;s stretch...it made him, antsy, warm. He couldn&#39;t help but press his legs together a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go ladies&quot; Jeremey said, not realizing the oddness of his phrasing. Each turned from the boardwalk, and stepped onto the sand. <br />
<br />
As they crossed the edge of the sand, a strange energy hit each of them. Stepping on the beach seemed to cross a portal of sorts, and their outfits shimmered and began to instantly shift to something more beach appropriate. <br />
<br />
A shimmering border began to eat away At Jeremey&#39;s shirt, melting it away into nothing. He was at the beach after all, no shirts needed. Hie shorts were another story. As the same shimmer crossed the khakis, he felt an intense pleasure and a unique sensation of expansion and fullness as his crotch thickened and swelled. His balls both grew to the size of tennis balls, while his now sheathed cock expanded to a thick 2-foot length befitting his equine nature. To encase, and display, this new growth, the slimer reduced and tightened his shorts into a skintight red speedo. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hawwwww&quot; He moaned as the sensations eclipsed and his body settled into its final state. <br />
<br />
As the shimmering light melded the other two&#39;s clothes, their changes were altogether different.  As the shimmer crossed their bodies it seemed to knit their shorts and shirts together into a single one piece. Michaels turned the same pink as Zach&#39;s fur, while Zach&#39;s took on Michael&#39;s blue. Just as with Jeremy, each of them experienced an intense pleasure. Each felt a strength shrinking at their crotches that quickly reached a crescendo as the shrinking turned inward and pleasurable folds opened between their lengths. The pleasure then spread to their chests. Leaning their heads back, their hair cascaded down their backs, faces contorted in pleasure as their chests pressed outward and a pleasant weight settled upon them. <br />
<br />
&quot;HaWWWWWWWWWWWWWW&quot; Each gasped, their voices light and feminine. Michael couldn&#39;t help but lean his arm on Zach for support, the two women basking in the pleasure and the feel of their bodies. Both felt amazing, but between the buzz and the pleasure,  yet comprehended their dramatic changes. <br />
<br />
As the shimmering, transforming light fizzled away, it left three very different figures. 2 well-endowed twenty-something donkey girls, and one thickly muscled, well hung 30 year old donkey man.</p>
