Meanwhile Back At The Table... Shortly After Billy And Ryan Left... <br />
<br />
Macy Turns To Jess And Says  &quot;What The Hell Jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Come On, What Are You Trying To Do?&quot; Macy Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;I Don&#39;t Know What Are You Talking About, I&#39;ve Done Nothing?&quot; Jess Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, You&#39;re Just Gonna Sulk The Whole Time This Is Supposed To Be A Date Have Some Fun...&quot; Macy Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Macy I Just Don&#39;t Think I&#39;m Ready To Date&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess Come On You&#39;ve Been My Best Friend Forever, Even If You Don&#39;t End Up Liking Him... Just Enjoy The Date... Seriously What&#39;s So Bad <br />
About Hanging Out And Having Our Meals Paid For... And All You Have To Do Is... Not Look So Dead Inside... Trust Me If You Do You&#39;ll End Up Having Fun!&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I Can&#39;t Promise Anything... But I&#39;ll Try Macy&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank You,  By The Way The Boy Probably Didn&#39;t Leave Because Of Drinks It Was Probably Because You Were So Disinterested... And <br />
They&#39;re Thinking Up A Game Plan... So When They Get Back Apologize And Say That You Had An Upset Stomach And Our Feeling Much Better&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
At That Moment, Ryan Hits Enter And The Two Boys Return With Drinks<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, We&#39;re Back&quot; Billy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s Your Drink&quot; Ryan Says<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Okay&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... I&#39;m Sorry For Being Such A Buzzkill, My Stomach Has Been Killing Me I Had To Go To The Bathroom...&quot; Jess Apologizes<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Are You Okay Now?&quot; Billy Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m Fine I Feel Much Better&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Good, Do You Want Anything Else To Eat?&quot; Ryan Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m Fine, Thank You&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Well, Shall We Order The Cheesecake&quot; Ryan Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds Great&quot; Billy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheesecake, Oh Yes I Love It&quot; Jess Says Playful Touching Billy&#39;s Hand (Unconsciously Doing So)<br />
<br />
&quot;Me Too&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;I Like It Too, I&#39;m Glad You Do&quot; Ryan Says<br />
<br />
Soon The Cheesecake Comes Out And They Begin Eating, Ryan, Billy And Macy All Notice That Jess Is In A Much Better Mood, Macy Happy That Jess Is Letting Go And Having Fun, While Billy And Ryan Were Happy The Change Worked... While They Were Eating Jess Found Herself Scooting Over To Sit Closer To Billy, And As She Eats She Finds Herself Leaning Into Him... While Talking And Jess Was Unknowingly Flirting With Billy... Macy And Ryan Were Also Hitting It Off...<br />
The Four Finish The Date... <br />
<br />
Ryan Asks &quot;Would You Girls Like To Continue This Date By Going To The Movies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That Sounds Fun&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Jess Says Not Wanting To Be A Buzzkill<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! We&#39;ll Be Right Back After We Pay!&quot; Ryan Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, We&#39;ll Wait Here&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
After They Paid They Came Back And Said &quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s Go!&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
At The Movies... The Four Of Them Had Gotten Their Snacks And Were Headed To Their Theater Room, As They Got There... They Found There Were Four Seats Left, And They Were Split Into Pairs On Opposite Sides Of The Theatre, Ryan And Macy Split Up To One Side While Billy And Jess Took The Other... Jess And Billy Had Been Sat Next To Each Other... As The Movie Started, The Lights Turned Off... Jess Found Herself Reaching For Her Drink... Only To Feel A Hand Touch Her Own... She Pulled Her Hand Away Quickly... As The Film Continued Jess Found Herself Getting Nervous, She Wasn&#39;t Sure What Had Come Over Her... But She Kept Thinking About The Hands Touching Her... The Warmth Of It... She Wasn&#39;t Sure, Why But She Found Herself Enjoying It... She Looked Over At Billy, Who Had Been Looking At Her...<br />
<br />
She Unknowingly Smiled A Big Smile At Him And Says &quot;Is Something Wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
He Says &quot;No, You&#39;re Just Very Pretty&quot;<br />
<br />
She Blushes And Says &quot;Thanks, You Too&quot; She Says Trying To Be Nice... But Also Cause She Meant It<br />
<br />
&quot;No Problem&quot; Billy Says<br />
<br />
Soon Jess Notices Billy Reaching His Hand Over Her Shoulder... Which Was Resting On The Back Of Her Chair, And Without Thinking Much... She Leans Into It Snuggling Into His Arm, Now Leaning Up Against It She Could Feel While Billy Wasn&#39;t Very Buff, His Muscles Were Defined... And She Felt Safe Next To Him... Jess Could Also Feel Billy&#39;s Breath On Her Neck, And Could Hear Him Breathing Deeply, His Chest Rumbling His Heart Beating Fast... She Looked Back At Him, And They Were Face To Face...Jess&#39;s Heart Began Racing<br />
Jess Wasn&#39;t Sure What Was Going On With Her... She Suddenly Got The Urge To Kiss Billy... So She Leaned In, Closing Her Eyes, She Planted Her Lips On His...And He Planted His Lips On Hers... Jess Found Herself Making Out With Billy, While Her Hands Went Around Him And His Went To Her Back, As They Made Out She Found Herself Moaning, It Was Her First Kiss, And It Was So Good... Jess Didn&#39;t Want It To Stop... But After A While, It Did But Only Because The Lights Turned On... The Movie Was Over And They Missed A Large Portion Of It... Jess Realized What She Had Done <br />
<br />
Jess Said &quot;I&#39;m Sorry I Didn&#39;t Mean Too&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy Answered &quot;Don&#39;t---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s Up Guys, What Did We Miss?&quot; Ryan Asked Interrupting Billy<br />
<br />
Jess And Billy Jumped Apart Realizing They Were In A Public Place, And Didn&#39;t Want To Look Suspicious<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; Jess And Billy Answered In Unison<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Macy Asked Suspiciously Noticing How Close The Two Have Gotten...<br />
<br />
&quot;We Went To The Bathroom And Came Back, Nothing Interesting Happened&quot; Jess Answered<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, Nothing At All Happened While We Were Gone&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Why&quot; Billy Asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Because Jess&#39;s Hair Is All Messy...And She Was Never One To Mess Up Her Hair&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh&quot; Jess Says Before Realizing That Macy Was Right Her Hair Was Messy And She Usually Had It Perfectly Brushed<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I Don&#39;t Know What You&#39;re Talking About, My Hair&#39;s Fine&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...&quot; Macy Says Obviously Knowing What Happened But Dropped It Not Wanting To Embarrass Jess As She Finally Left Her Shell<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Since The Movie&#39;s Over I Should Get Home...&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Can We Get Your Numbers For A Possible Future Date?&quot; Ryan Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Here This Is Mine And This One Is Jess&#39;s, Give Us A Call&quot; Macy Says Handing Note To Both Ryan Billy<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool&quot; Billy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Well, See You&quot; Jess Says Smiling<br />
<br />
&quot;You Too&quot; Ryan Says As He And Billy Leave Together While Macy And Jess Head The Opposite Way...<br />
<br />
&quot;Macy, What The Hell? Why Did You Give Out My Number?&quot; Jess Questions Upset At Macy<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess I Was Trying Not To Bring It Up And Embarrass You Since You Were Finally Leaving Your Comfort Zone.... But Are You Seriously Just <br />
Gonna Pretend To The End That You Didn&#39;t Kiss Him?&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;No... But Maybe He Kissed Me?&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Ryan Told Me How Much Billy Struggles With Girls, He Would Never Make The First Move Which Means You Did, And The Only <br />
Reason You Would Do That Is If You Liked Him... Jess, Why Deny It This Is A Good Thing!&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;ve Only Known Him For Like Two Hours... Macy I&#39;m Just Not Sure If I Like Him&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sure You Will Figure It Out... Besides He Seems Nice And He&#39;s Definitely Into You... So Give It A Shot&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Can We Just Drop It&quot; Jess Says Walking With Macy Back Into Jess&#39;s House Where Jess&#39;s Mom Asks There Day Was...<br />
<br />
&quot;It Was Fun, We Went On A Double Date!&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s Mom Says &quot;Really? Was Jess A Bummer The Whole Time Macy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She Was At First But After I Talked Her Into Having Fun, She Was Very Social She Even Made The First Move Kissing The Boy&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Macy&quot; Jess Says Embarrassed Trying To Get Macy To Be Quiet<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s Mom Eyes Go Wide And Says &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m Glad She Had A Good Time&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... But She Is Being Really Stubborn About It... They Even Asked Us On A Second Date... But I Don&#39;t Think Jess Will Do It With How <br />
Stubborn She&#39;s Being&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Really! Jess, Come On! It&#39;s Just Another Date With A Guy You Obviously Liked Enough To Kiss!&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Yells<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mom The Punishment Is Over... And This Is Your Fault For Making Me Go On The Date In The First Place!&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m Heading Home Mrs. Johnson Please Convince Her To Go...  I Really Like The Boy And I&#39;m Pretty Sure He Likes Jess Just As Much As She Likes Him&quot; Macys Says Before Leaving<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks For A Fun Time, See You&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;See You&quot; Macy Says Before Walking Out Of The Door<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, I Think You Should Give Him A Chance&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom Why Didn&#39;t You Change Back Macy? Back Into Mason? And Why Are You Just Sitting There Not Changing Me Back? Haven&#39;t I Done <br />
The Punishment Already&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... Jess It&#39;s True That Punishment Is Over... But I&#39;m Not Changing You Back Yet... &quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I Want You To Keep Going On Dates, As Long As Your Dating Someone Who Likes You And You Like... And I&#39;m Not Going To Allow You Being A Boy As An Excuse To Not Go On A Second Date... Or Any Other Dates For That Matter&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
&quot;What, No. That&#39;s Ridiculous, You&#39;re Forcing Me On A Date I Don&#39;t Want To Go On?&quot; Jess Says Upset<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Sweetie...If You Don&#39;t Want To Go On A Date With The Boy You Don&#39;t Have Too... But In The 16 Years I&#39;ve Been Raising You, You&#39;ve <br />
Shown No Interest Or Desire To Try And Get A Girlfriend, Expecting One To Fall Right Into Your Lap... But One Day As A Girl And Not Only Did You Go On A Date But You Willingly Kissed A Boy... So Yes I&#39;m Going To Keep You As A Girl... So That You Don&#39;t Throw Away Your Future Away Over Something So Meaningless, Like Your Insecurities&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;This Is Not Fair... And How Do You Know That I Like The Boy?&quot; Jess Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Not Dumb Jess, I Know That Look, You&#39;ve Never Been In Love Before So You Don&#39;t Recognize It Yourself, But I&#39;ve Been There I Know What It Looks Like And Trust Me... It&#39;s There, I&#39;m Just Giving You The Nudge You Need&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;This Still Isn&#39;t Fair&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... But Describe The Boy You Went On Date With...Maybe If You Do A Good Job I Let You At Least Spend The Time Until The Date As A Boy?&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! What Do You Wanna Know His Name Was Billy He&#39;s Tall... He&#39;s Strong For Not Being Very Strong Looking... He&#39;s Nice Always Trying To Keep The Conversation Interesting But Letting Me Talk When I Have Something To Say, He&#39;s Funny Always Cracking Jokes Trying To Get A Laugh Out, He&#39;s A Good Listener Even When I Have Nothing To Say And He&#39;s Easy To Talk To Because He Can Talk About Anything And Make It Sound Interesting, He&#39;s Caring Despite Being On A Date With Me He Never Pushed For Anything Or Forced Our Connection, And He&#39;s Sweet Even When I Kissed Him...&quot; Jess Stops Herself Blushing A Beet Red And Doing Her Best To Hide Face  Realizing She Was Rambling Too Much About Billy...<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s Mom Smiles At Her Daughter Realizing She&#39;s Fallen Hard For Billy, She Then Says &quot;Jess Did I Ever Tell You How Your Father And I Met?<br />
<br />
Jess Reveals Her Face From Under Her Arms Face Still Beat Red And Says &quot;No...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, We Met When We Were Teenagers, In School And We Were Friends Immediately We Just Had This Magical Connection And Became The Best Of Friends...&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends Not Dating?&quot; Jess Questions<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Just Friends We Never Got Together All Through Highschool... But We Both Had A String Of Partners... That Never Seem To Get Off The Ground...&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Why Didn&#39;t You Get Together? Did You Not Like Each Other Back Then? Or Did Just Not Connect?&quot; Jess Questions<br />
<br />
&quot;No... It Wasn&#39;t Because Of Attraction, Or Connection, It Was About How Good A Friend We Were To Each Other... It Was So Magical That Neither Of Us Wanted To Risk Ruining The Friendship Over Our Feeling For Each Other... In Fact... During Our Last Partners Before We Ended Up Together... We Were Both Broken Up With Because Our Partners Felt Uncomfortable Feeling Like They Could Never Match Or Beat What We Had For Each Other...&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Said<br />
<br />
&quot;So When You Two Finally Got Together Was It As Magical As You Hoped?&quot; Jess Questions Really Interested<br />
<br />
&quot;No...While Being Friends Came Easy Too Us...Being A Couple Didn&#39;t... We Were Just As Awkward As You Might Expect Us Too Be, It Was Weird To Be So Close To Someone Yet Have So Much Pressure To Make Sure We Did Things Right As A Couple, And When We Would Fight It Would Feel Like The Worst Thing In The World Because For The Two Of Us Whenever Life Got Bad Before We Would Go To Each Other For Comfort We Both Helped Each Other Through Some Tough And Painful Break Ups But Dating When We Fought We Didn&#39;t Have Our Anchors Anymore... I Wasn&#39;t Sure If I Wanted To Endure It Any Longer Hoping We Could End It In A Way That We Could Still Be Friends Somehow..., But Before I Could Your Father Said This To Me &quot;I Love You Isabelle, And We Are Going To Fight...Every Relationship Does But...The Thing We Haven&#39;t Been Doing And Should Is Talk It Out...With Each Other Like We Did Before...Because I Want To Spend The Rest Of My Life With You...&quot; And He Got Down On His Knee And Proposed...&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait So Dad Proposed After Dating You For Like A Month Max&quot;&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... But I Didn&#39;t Accept The Proposal Thinking It Was Way To Early And We Were Almost Broken Up... But I Did Agree To Keep Fighting For Us And A 2 Months Later... I Realized All Those Years We Spent As Friends Was Our Time Before Getting Married... And After 2 Months Of Blissfully Dating Your Father... I Proposed To Him, And I&#39;ll Tell You What It Was Magical, And Then A Year Later We Got Married Our Honeymoon Was The Day We Got Pregnant With You...&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Sweet I Never Knew That... I Didn&#39;t Think You And Dad Had A Story Like That, They Seemed So Perfect For Each Other... It&#39;s Super Romantic&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank You Honey, I&#39;m Glad You Think So...And I Know You&#39;ll Have A Story Of Your Own Someday, But You Need To Be Patient, You&#39;ll Find The One For You, Whether It&#39;s Billy Or Not Whether Your A Girl Or Not... And When You Do And You Will... Don&#39;t Make The Mistake I Made And Missing Your Chance... Take The Leap Before It&#39;s Too Late...Because I Regret All Those Years I Spent Not With Your Father... Because We Knew Day 1, We Were Meant For Each Other But Waited Years Before We Got Together!&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Mom... Thanks... I&#39;ve Never Heard Your Side Of The Story... It&#39;s Sweet&quot; Jess Says Tearing Up<br />
<br />
&quot;I Know I Just Want You To Know That If You Find Your Special Someone Don&#39;t Wait Until You&#39;re Old And Grey To Make The Move... Because Even If It Doesn&#39;t Work Out... It&#39;s Better To Have Loved And Lost Then Never To Have Loved At All...&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Jess Says Still Crying Before Hugging Her Mother<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll Even Give You A Few Days As A Boy Before Your Next Date... But You Will Go Right?&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mom... But Don&#39;t Change Me Back Into A Boy... Just Yet...And Maybe Tomorrow You Can Help Me Learn How To Do My Hair And Make-Up So I&#39;m Ready For My Date?&quot; Jess Says Embarrassed She Just Said That Regretting It...<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Sure&quot; Jess&#39;s Mom Says Before Kissing Her Daughter On The Head And Walking Off...<br />
<br />
Jess Smiles Before Running To Her Room And Bringing Out Her Phone... Billy Had Sent Her A Text Earlier... She Opened It Up...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jess, Sorry It&#39;s Late I Don&#39;t Want To Wake You, Haha Anyway Just Letting You Know I Had A Great Time, You&#39;re Really Cool And Pretty...I&#39;ll Call You Soon, Hope You Got Home Safe Love Billy P.S Sorry About The Love Billy I Didn&#39;t Mean Too Sound Overly Forward... I Couldn&#39;t Figure Out How To Delete It&quot; The Text Read<br />
<br />
Jess Reads The Text And Smiles Blushing Billy Was Just So Cute With How Nervous He Sounded Even In A Text...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I Had A Great Time Too! And I&#39;m Not Mad About The Love, In Fact I Think It&#39;s Sweet...Looking Forward To A Second Date</p>
