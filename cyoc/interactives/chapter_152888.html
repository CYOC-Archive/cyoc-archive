<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There wasn&#39;t really a need to milk my udder right now.  I&#39;d just be sitting around, waiting for it to fill up and probably end up needing to do it again tonight.  Instead, I decided to try and wait through the day.  If it started to hurt too much or I started leaking, I&#39;d definitely milk myself.  Until then, I&#39;ll just do what I was planning to do prior to getting this udder.<br />
<br />
My stomach grumbled and I was already beginning to feel a little thirsty, so I went back down to the kitchen to pick up my still-filled mug and some nutrient biscuits.  As I looked at the stacks of dry patties, I decided to instead grab a few extra, so I wouldn&#39;t have to leave my room as often.  At three a day, 11 would keep me clear all the way to Tuesday.  I stacked up what I&#39;d gathered, and moved back to my room.<br />
<br />
I started with something simple: my cell phone.  I wanted to know what different contacts I had compared to before, and now was as good a time as any to do so.  This didn&#39;t take nearly as much time, as all of my friends were still in there.  The exception was two different names.  The first was labeled &quot;Doctor,&quot; which after looking into the profile more closely was a Mr. Watowski.  Maybe he was my primary doctor for my condition?  I wondered how close I was with him, or when I should contact him.  The second was a &quot;Alex Frasiabi,&quot; which had the nickname of &quot;Milkman.&quot; I actually filled out his business field on my phone, and I was pretty sure that was the same name as the canisters that I saw outside.  Was he there to drop off canisters, or was he there to pick up the full ones?  My parents would be back tomorrow, so maybe I could use that to figure out his purpose.<br />
<br />
I chowed down on a biscuit to keep myself from feeling peckish as I sat at my desk.  My phone was pretty much finished, so I started up the computer so I could check my social media.  There wasn&#39;t much different from yesterday, meaning all my regular plans were likely still on.  If there was anything unique, alternate-universe me seemed to state his timeline and future plans about as well as I did, which was not at all.  With the two major parts done, I decided to whittle away the time with games, videos, and online forums.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s exactly what I did, for hours.  The pressure in my udder never became too distracting, just a constant tightness that reminded me of its existence.  It merely sat happily hanging between my legs as I fooled around online.  I watched a few random videos about cats, got involved in some microcosms of drama, and yelled at a few repetitive games.  <br />
<br />
I was snapped out of my stupor when I reached for another one of those nutrient cookies, and none were left.  I immediately stopped what I was doing and took a closer look.  I still felt hungry, but I&#39;d just eaten 11 of those over...7 hours?!  It was about an hour away from dinner, so I could maybe excuse a couple of them for lunch, but I just ate four times as much of a super-dose of nutrients, and I was still hungry for more.  Something had to be wrong.<br />
<br />
I tried to push my chair back, and blanched as I felt my udder sway.  I pulled myself free from my desk, realizing that my udder was now hanging much further off my gut!  It still felt as dense as before, but it had somehow grown in the mere hours that I&#39;d taken a seat!<br />
<br />
I heaved my body up, and I could feel the strain on my knees as I did so.  The udder loomingly swayed in front of me, now slightly wider than my hips.  Gravity tried to pull it between my legs, but it still sat a proud 2 feet in front of me.  Each of the teats looked comedically small as they stood at stiff attention on this grossly-engorged milk-bag.<br />
<br />
My mind reeled.  Lucas had to have been telling the truth, but how was this physically possible?  Did my body repurpose the cookies into more udder instead of more milk?  Would it shrink back down if I got it milked?  Was it going to keep growing if I didn&#39;t milk it now?<br />
<br />
I needed to get this milked, now.  I didn&#39;t realize this thing might grow until I&#39;m pinned by it.  I tried to move quickly at first, but the new weight of my udder caused it to sway immensely, so much that it caught the wall of my door frame as I tried to pass through.  I staggered backwards, falling back and catching myself on the bed.  I rubbed the struck area to help the pain subside, taking deep breaths to focus myself through the throbbing agony coursing through my body.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have time to recover if this wretched thing was still growing.  Using the walls to support myself, I shoved my body through the hallway, down the stairs, and outside.  Once I got to the milker, I slowly lowered myself to the ground.  The udder touched down long before I got in reach of the apparatus, but I didn&#39;t care.  I sloppily pressed one tube to each teat, then made my way to the primary machine.  I pressed the button labeled &quot;on,&quot; and the pump immediately began.<br />
<br />
I was absolutely unprepared for the wave of sensation that hit me.  I gave an orgasmic moan as it felt far more amazing than any masturbation session I&#39;d had.  Each pull felt like an ejaculation, meaning just one teat was enough to put my previous experiences to shame, and four of them combined threw me into perpetual state of euphoria.  I could hardly breathe through the constant onslaught.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d blacked out or if I lost my sense of up from down, but it wasn&#39;t long before I was lying on the ground, curled around my udder as the machine continued to pump away.  Perhaps it was the rhythmic pulse of the machine or my inability to breathe, but reality melted away as I joyously fell into unconsciousness.</p>
