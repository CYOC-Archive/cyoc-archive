<br />
Jeff was still excited. He thought about what evolution actually had done to his girlfriend. 100 years are not much for an evolution but ~ about 3 generations. The environment influence was set to 100% and she was exercising. Thus, her evolution should somehow be like her previous 3 generations would permanently train. He didn&#39;t think that this might cause big changes to her but might lead the observed changes.<br />
<br />
Having an explanation was just happened, Jeff wanted to proof his theory. He for sure wanted to see a difference now so he just increased to 1000 years, shortly thinking if this might be to much. He quickly pushed that thought away since evolution took million of years for humankind. He also activated the continues mode so he can just hold down the trigger as long as he want. Lastly he also changed the environmental influence factor. He noticed that the can set it to more than 100% so he changed it to 1000%.<br />
<br />
<br />
If his theory was true, Susan should experience some serious changes during her next exercise.<br />
<br />
*Target: Susan Taylor<br />
*Evolution parameterization:<br />
->Time span: 1000 years<br />
->Continues mode: true<br />
->Awareness: Operator<br />
->Lock target age: true<br />
->Environmental influence factor: 1000%<br />
<br />
<br />
Susan&#39;s mobile phone beeped and notified both, that the resting phase was over. Immediately, she started to do sit ups, arms locked behind her head. Thanks to her previous changes, the exercise looked gracefully and professional. This was the moment when Jeff laid his finger on the trigger and Susan was once more surrounded by a faint red aura. This time, it might looked even a bit brighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;30 generations per second, this should really do something&quot;, thought Jeff as he observed his girlfriend. Jeff saw with each sit up how Susan&#39;s abs contracted, since her midriff was exposed between her training top and her yoga pants. After several seconds he was not sure if her abs really looked bigger or of this was only due to the exercise. Also her steady motion made it quite hard to really see a difference. But her movements looked smoother then before and less effortlessly. And then he noticed a small line forming on her stomach where seconds be for none was. The little fat she had seemed to melt way as her abdominal muscles start to push out. &quot;Unbelievable, the Chronivac really works. No way.&quot;, he confirmed in excitement, &quot;Jut a bit more&quot;. After another 10 seconds Jeff put off his finger from the trigger. Immediately, the red glow vanished as the effects of the evolution stopped.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched Susan to finish her set, feeling something in his pants shifting and getting hard. He tried to hide his boner not wanting to offense Susan. But he was really turned on by the sight of his girlfriend. Even her arms looked a bit more developed. Most likely the musculature of her whole body must have developed during the last evolution. He quickly checked the math and figured out, that she must have evolved 20k years in an environment which must be very strenuous for her body, especially for her midriff, considering the increased environmental influence factor.<br />
<br />
Another beep of Susan&#39;s app let him snap back to reality. Susan finished her last sit up before sitting up looking a bit disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats wrong hon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Those workouts are not really challenging anymore. I know, my body is responding quite good, but I feel like I don&#39;t have any progress lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hu? She developed a killer figure and is sad that it stopped there? That&#39;s Interesting. Maybe the evolution has also changed her mentally?&quot;, thought Jeff and replied, &quot;You look ineradicable. Stunning. And you made insane progress.&quot; He knew exactly where this came from, but played along.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, thanks. But I feel, like I&#39;m a natural gainer. Its in my genes. And I want more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why stop here? Why not start to do more challenging workouts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know? With the current rate of gaining, I&#39;m afraid that I might scare you. You know, a lot of man are afraid of a strong girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? I absolutely love it. I would like to see you with even more muscle. Stronger muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;, said Jeff and tried to calm her down with the most sympathetic smile on his face opening his arms inviting her for a hug, &quot;Come here darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure? Even it was not that challenging, I&#39;m really seating. I for sure smell&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here.&quot; he said again.<br />
<br />
During the hugging, Jeff felt the strong and well defined muscles of Susan&#39;s shoulders and her back. She really had developed some serious and sexy muscles. Feeling more comfortable, Susan began to kiss him. Both ending up in a deep passionate kissing. Jeff was in heaven. And so was Susan. Jeff felt hist hard cock been pressed against her flat but hard stomach. First he was a bit embarrassed but Susan guided one hand down on his butt pressing herself even harder against him.<br />
<br />
Slowly the they separated when Jeff noticed, that Susan was almost eye level with him. She must have also grown in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Honey? Can I feel those abs? And your biceps?&quot;, asked Jeff not exactly knowing how she would react to this strange request.<br />
<br />
Without a word she slowly grabbed his right hand and moved it to her abs. Most of them were covered by her shirt. He could feel small bumps as she moved his hand from left to right. She then moved his hand upwards. He almost touched her peaky breast as she quickly snapped it down: &quot;Nah. You perv&quot; said Susan giggling as she only joked. Jeff tried to push his finger into her muscles but pitifully failed. &quot;Pretty hard?&quot;, she said not expecting an answer. Susan also enjoyed the feeling of her Jeff&#39;s touch.<br />
<br />
Next, she flexed her right biceps. A lemon sized mound of feminine muscle rose. Compared to the size and developed of her abs, it looked quite small but yet strong and hard. Jeff grabbed with both hands her biceps immediately recognizing, that the are not only for show. He again tried to squeeze them but even with both of his hands and all his strength we was not strong enough to deform or move it. To be fair, he also was not the strongest guy in town.<br />
<br />
<br />
Invisible to both, the evolution has done it thing and not only made Susan stronger but also change her genetic code in multiple ways. Her muscles, bones and tissue grew denser. She was a lot stronger than she looked. Her skin got tougher, her training way more efficient. She got more resistant to harms and illnesses and recovers insanely fast. Her endurance and stamina increased tenfold. Her appearance was only the tip of the iceberg.<br />
<br />
Thinking of what to do next, Jeff came up an idea. She wants to be stronger and he wants her to be stronger. But with the currently turned on awareness setting, she would never recognize any changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can help you&quot;, said Jeff and powered up the Chronivac and told Susan about the device and how it works.</p>
