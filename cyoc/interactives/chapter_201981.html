<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom just moans quietly as his cock continues to spew a thin stream of cum, all thanks to you and your powers which were granted to you by your magical ring. He’s practically passed out when you must decide whether to send him back to school like that or not. <br />
<br />
“Time to give Tom a little advantage over all the other soccer guys, just to give them a taste of their own medicine!” you smile as you look over Tom’s body as he lay on your bed. “Let’s pump up his leg muscles so that he has by far the biggest legs of anyone on the soccer team!” <br />
<br />
The moment Tom falls asleep on your mattress in the locker room, you cause his quads and calves to pack on even MORE muscle. His legs are already pumped, but you decide his legs need to be supercharged so that he’s faster than anyone else on the soccer field! <br />
<br />
Just as you command the ring to do for you, Tom’s quads begin to widen with even more muscle, as those cords of muscle on his quads grow even thicker, wider, and deeper than they were before. His quads widen on both sides, making him look like a professional cyclist or a marathon runner with those massive legs. His calves inflate by another three inches, growing into large cantaloupes of solid muscle covered completely in a network of veins. You decide not to make him more than an inch taller than he was before, so he remained the shortest player on the team, but with legs like these, he would blast across the pitch like a racehorse! <br />
<br />
Lastly, you decide that the soccer boy should have insane soccer skills to the likes of the players who play on the national teams in the World Cup! Impressive ball-handling skills, with passing, dribbling and shooting were now gifted upon the teen. <br />
<br />
“Okay, Tommy! Time to go back to school!” you smile, as Tom wakes up, slowly. “Back to the wall, where you join the rest of the team before the bell rings before the start of class!” <br />
<br />
You snap your fingers and you and Tom are back at the wall by the row of lockers. Tom is standing by the others, kicking the ball against the wall when the bell rings. <br />
<br />
The boys stop and walk down the hall. All five of the others sneer or hiss at you as they walk right past you. Tom, however, stops right in front of you. <br />
<br />
“Hi, Brian!” he says with a smile. <br />
<br />
You look him over. He looks amazing. Short and very muscular! His legs are massive! Damn, he’s cute. He’s adorable with all that muscle and those short, thick, massive legs. <br />
<br />
You reach out and you grab his head. Then you tilt your head as you kiss him on the lips. <br />
<br />
“I love you.” You say to him. <br />
<br />
He turns around and he joins his teammates as they run off to class. That afternoon, they have a soccer practice game on the field by the football stadium and Tom was stellar! Tom outran everyone and he just couldn’t be caught. Not only that, but he scored three out of the five goals for his team! All the other players, including the coach, were very impressed with his performance. Everyone was assuming that Tom had spent an insane amount of time working out his legs in the gym lately, since his legs had become so muscular. He ran much faster, and he kicked the ball harder than just about everyone else on the field. Nobody could even come close!<br />
<br />
You sat in the bleachers during the practice match, and you cheered him on as he scored one goal after the other. When the match was over, you stood up and you met him in front of the bleachers where you embraced him and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Unfortunately, the other guys saw that, too. <br />
<br />
The other guys walked up to you as you were talking to Tom, and they started shouting at him. <br />
<br />
Jack was the one with the hottest personality, who started shouting the loudest, while Ben, James, Michael, and Sam stood behind him. <br />
<br />
“What THE HELL was that?” he yelled out Tom. “This guy is a gay FAGGOT! Stay away from him! What were you doing, kissing him? Are you out of your MIND?” <br />
<br />
“I like Brian! Leave him alone! He helped me work out my legs so I could become a better soccer player!” Tom protested. <br />
<br />
Jack became very angry as he walked up to Tom and pushed him away, almost causing Tom to fall on the ground. <br />
<br />
As you looked on, you use quick thinking to cause Tom to gain a quick fifty pounds of solid muscle in the rest of his body, everywhere else but his legs. As you looked on, you saw Tom’s chest, arms and pecs inflate rapidly. His shoulders became much wider as his arms doubled in width. <br />
<br />
“We don’t want any GAY PLAYERS on THIS TEAM!” Jack shouted. <br />
<br />
Jack charged at Tom and tried pushing him again, but Tom stood his ground this time, thanks to him gaining additional muscle and strength! <br />
<br />
“BACK OFF, JACK!” Tom shouted back, as he shoved Jack back so hard and with so much force, that he sent Jack’s body flying into the first, lowest, aluminum row of bleachers. Jack slammed into the row with a loud thud as he remained laying there for two minutes as the other boys looked on in horror. <br />
<br />
Finally, Jack stood up and limped back into the locker room. He didn’t look too good. Tom was visibly upset as you walked up to him.<br />
<br />
“Here, stay with me. Don’t worry about it. He’ll get over it!” you say, as Tom burst out in tears while he hugged you.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t want to hurt him, but he pushed me!” Tom sobbed. “I don’t want to become a bully!”<br />
<br />
“You’re not a bully. You’re a good kid. He attacked you! Don’t worry. Here, let’s go to my house!” you say to him as you teleport you and Tom to your bedroom, where you let him lay down on your bed. <br />
<br />
 You wave your hand and Tom is naked again. You make his cock spring to life and a stream of cum shoots in the air. <br />
<br />
“There, a nice long orgasm will make you feel better!” <br />
<br />
You look on at Tom on your bed. Damn, he looks so cute, now. All that muscle on his short frame. You almost want to grow him even more. But, what to do about the other guys on the soccer team? You figure you may need to handle them one-by-one, one at a time!</p>
