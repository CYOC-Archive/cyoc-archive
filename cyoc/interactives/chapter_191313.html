<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was giddy and horny as I waited for the girls to arrive. I almost wished for them to immediately show up, but reminded myself that using such power recklessly could lead to problems. Plus, I&#39;d always enjoyed edging myself, even before my ascension to divinity.  When I&#39;d been just a normal girl, I&#39;d often fantasize during the day, knowing that whenever I finally did decide to give myself that release, it would be so much more intense.<br />
<br />
I went up to my room and found a sundress in the closet. It was thin and white, light cotton. It hung just  to my mid-thigh – long enough to be considered decent, but short enough to discreetly and conveniently flash my pussy, either intentionally or “accidentally”. I turned around with my back to the full-length mirror on the closet and glanced over my shoulder and slowly bent over, smiling as the dress rode slowly up and displayed my divine wolfmaker fully, without requiring me to go into a full mating arch. I turned back around and walked a little closer to the mirror. My hands found my tits and pinched my nipples to hardness, and again I smiled at how easily and prominently they could be seen; even the slightly darker areolas could be spotted through the fabric if you were looking at them.<br />
<br />
I went back downstairs and turned the tv on to have a little background noise, and to make it seem a bit more natural. No need to have the girls thinking I&#39;d been sitting in silence waiting on their arrival...even if all I would need to do is make them look at my twat to get them in line if they DID get spooked.  I couldn&#39;t help it – I slid a hand under my sundress and felt the heat coming off of my pussy. I didn&#39;t even need to touch it; I was so wound up that it practically had an aura of warmth. I slid one finger down one of my labia, and I was instantly quivering. I could smell my pussy so strongly..so feminine, so wolflike... I pulled my shaking hand away, and sucked on my fingertip, which had gotten a couple of drops of my juices on it, and I let out a soft moan as I thought about having a woman&#39;s face down there, feeling a muzzle between my legs, eating pussy as we changed. I&#39;d only ever had two girls simultaneously once in my life, and it was the best experience I&#39;d ever had, getting both ends of my body stimulated. My pussy ached as I lost myself in the memory, and the knowledge that soon, I&#39;d have that again, but this time with all of us changing!  I had to fight against the urge to succumb to the temptation, or else both of those girls were gonna get fucked the second they got in the door.<br />
<br />
Soon enough though, there was a knock on my door. My pussy got even hotter, and I wondered how long I&#39;d be able to hold out. As I approached the door, I could hear the mumbling of two young female voices, and put on my most charming smile. I opened it and saw the twins – a pair of -mostly- identical  girls. The primary differences being that one had dyed her hair a vibrant blue, while the other had dyed hers a deep black. Blue girl was dressed in shorts and a playful “My Little Pony” crop top, while the girl with black hair was in tight black jeans and a jet black t-shirt with The Crow on it. They both looked good enough to eat...or to let them eat me, I guess you could say. But facially, they were the same, bright blue eyes, lighter eyebrows, probably meaning they were sandy blondes, naturally. Button noses that had slightly wide tips...lusciously full lips.<br />
<br />
“Come in!” I said eagerly, as my pussy boiled. “You&#39;re Darlene&#39;s kids, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” said the blue haired girl cheerfully. “I&#39;m Lacey, and this bundle of joy is Lynn. You&#39;re Joella, right?” I nodded. Lacey&#39;s top was pushed out quite far. Either she had ridiculously nice tits, or she had a great push-up bra. Meanwhile, I couldn&#39;t tell much about her sister&#39;s upper half; Lynn&#39;s t-shirt was oversized, hiding any curves. But both of them had shapely asses. I was going to have fun turning these two.<br />
<br />
“Have a seat,” I said, gesturing to the couch, as I took a seat in an armchair next to the tv.<br />
<br />
“So, my mom said you had something to talk about with us? Some sort of an opportunity?” Lynn said. She looked annoyed at having been made to come out here. She had a certain dominant aura about her. There could be fun in making her submit, OR letting her take a bit of control. Conversely, Lacey was a naturally smiling girl who almost radiated innocence. Likewise, there could be fun in letting her show how good of a girl she could be...OR in giving her a true reward for her kind nature.<br />
<br />
“Well first, I&#39;d like to get to know you guys a little bit, if that&#39;s okay,” I said. <br />
<br />
Lynn let out an exasperated sigh. “Not sure what good that&#39;ll do..but sure..”, drawing a light elbow in the ribs from Lacey.<br />
<br />
“Be nice!” she chided her sister. “Sorry..Lynn&#39;s having a bad day.”<br />
<br />
I smiled warmly. No need for the girl to realize that even her moodiness was getting me hornier. Go on then, girl..grind your pussy on my face! We can have angry werewolf sex, if that&#39;s what you want.<br />
“It&#39;s fine,” I told her. So what do you two do for work?<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m an IT person for Best Buy-the Geek Squad,” Lacey said.”It&#39;s not necessarily what I want to do with my life..but they pay okay, and they&#39;re super-inclusive.”<br />
<br />
“I DJ for Club Sanguine,” Lynn said. “It&#39;s a goth-industrial club. I know, I know..I should have a real job..” she sighed, making air quotes. “But we can&#39;t all be perfect little wage slaves like my baby sister.”<br />
<br />
Lacey rolled her eyes. “She was born one minute and thirty two seconds ahead of me, and will never let me forget it,” she laughed.<br />
<br />
“So what&#39;s this opportunity?” Lynn asked with a scowl. I was trying to figure out how much of this was just a case of resting bitch face, and how much was something more. “I have to work in a few hours, and I&#39;d rather be napping.”<br />
<br />
“A chance to change the world,” I replied. I had been willing to let this play out longer, but Lynn clearly would need a bit of a nudge. I pretended to play with the edge of my sundress absentmindedly, and splayed my legs just a bit. “I&#39;m sure you agree that it&#39;s frustrating the way that women like us don&#39;t get much of a say in the world.”  Lacey&#39;s eyes immediately fixed on the motion, and she caught a glimpse. Her eyes widened. Her mouth turned up in a smile for a second. She tried to make eye contact with me, but her eyes immediately gravitated right to my crotch again. Lynn, however, was only half-paying attention to me, and instead seemed more interested in the cartoon network show, having missed it entirely. No matter. I could fix that.<br />
<br />
“Oh..” I said, standing up. “Let me just turn that off..” I made it a point to stand right in front of the tv and bend deeply over, giving them both a blatant eyeful of my vulva. I turned back around, pretending to be clueless about what I&#39;d done. “And if the two of you would join up with me, I&#39;m sure we can change the world.”<br />
<br />
Lacey was looking at me with undisguised desire. Her face was flushed. Her hand, curiously enough, was resting on Lynn&#39;s thigh, gripping it tightly. Lynn&#39;s eyes were wide. Her expression seemed to be one of surprise and shock. “Umm..can..can I borrow your bathroom..” she weakly asked. Needless to say, this was not the reaction I&#39;d expected. <br />
<br />
“Sure, it&#39;s down the hall, first door on the left,” I said, and she practically darted down the hall and shut the door. I turned my attention to Lacey fully. “I hope everything&#39;s alright,” I said, noticing how she was struggling to maintain eye contact, even more severely now.<br />
<br />
“Umm..” Lacey said softly. “Did..umm..did you know that you flashed us your..umm..”<br />
<br />
I smiled, and opened my legs again, and immediately, her eyes darted there. She chewed a fingernail nervously. “You don&#39;t seem to mind, Lacey. Am I wrong?”<br />
<br />
Lacey shook her head, “I....I don&#39;t. Lynn probably didn&#39;t either..but..she&#39;ll deny it.”<br />
<br />
A  plan formed in my mind. A perfect plan. “That&#39;s a shame. There&#39;s nothing wrong with wanting to be with a woman.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah..and I&#39;m..well..I&#39;m gay as fuck, pardon my language,” Lacey said. “And..I know that Lynn has definitely had not-straight thoughts. So..I definitely agree.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe you could..help me nudge her into..accepting a new reality?” I suggested gently. I was being careful with my words. I didn&#39;t want to push to hard and be forced to make a wish.<br />
<br />
“I can try,” Lacey said. “But she&#39;s pretty stubborn.” She paused. “If..uhh..if she declines..do you think there&#39;s a chance you and me could..umm..” she smiled, and now was making no pretense of staring at my bared vulva, before giving me a look of pure longing.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll make you a deal,” I told her. “If you get her to..open up..” I gave her a slight wink, “I&#39;ll give you the most mind-blowing oral you&#39;ve ever gotten. And if she dips..I&#39;m gonna ride your face until you&#39;re covered in my cum.”<br />
<br />
“That seems like a win-win deal no matter what,” Lacey said. <br />
<br />
“Oh, it is. It is indeed,” I said, as we heard the bathroom door open.</p>
