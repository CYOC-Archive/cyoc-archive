<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He gives a foxy grin at some of the ladies as he looks at the merchandise, being polite by complimenting their hair or something about them before walking away only to be half tackled each and every time to get yet another girls number as each of the girls leave he frowns as his friends walk towards him in a mixture of disgust, envy, but love. They all knew he was gay but for reasons they never understood why he had killer luck with any female he came across asking him for help when it came to picking up chicks. Entering the bar all they every got from him was a shrug and that irritating frown as they sat at the bar &quot;Marco, Jason, Brad I&#39;m done! I&#39;ve had it! You only hang out with me to pick up chicks, we never even hang out before, hell you shunned me all of high school like I was the plague and the only time we did was long enough for me to get you guys number of women you like just to be shot down thinking it was me that was going to date them&quot; Marco and Brad laughed like he was an idiot and he had to agree with them. He was an idiot, an idiot for hanging out with these sick fucks for so long Jason on the other hand was hurt by the comment but hid it under his mask to fit in, to be the cool guy, the stupid quarter back, but.. but that! Was far from the truth. It was like calling a level 9 hurricane a small breeze it just wasn&#39;t. He ran his hand through his dirty blond hair with a sigh as he waited for his so called &quot;friends&quot; to start bashing the honestly handsome kid in front of him for what he was and honestly he was to his own breaking point but as he was in thought of what to do he wasn&#39;t even aware at what was going on &quot;What was that you little pussy?! Say it again, I didn&#39;t hear you!&quot; Marco growled out he was pissed though it was just some measly comment about him having a de-evolved brain and something along the lines of him being too ugly to meet even Frankenstein&#39;s standards &quot;I said.. If you weren&#39;t so damn ugly the girls I picked up for your stupid asses wouldn&#39;t leave the restaurants screaming bloody murder! but because I&#39;m sure your sub-human brains couldn&#39;t catch such difficult words I&#39;ll simplify it so you retards can understand. your, ugly. scare off girls, and brain go poof&quot; the kid said loud enough for anyone in earshot could hear and everyone who did were struggling to hold back laughs myself along with them and before anyone could even blink Marco had slammed the kid against the wall with enough force to make everyone who saw wince slightly but before he could go any further I blacked out only having flashes of images running through my mind of my self tackling Marco to the floor. My fists flying, stinging as they made contact with his jaw again and again for the longest time span of a minute I counted how many times I hit him hard, one.. two.. thirteen.. and finishing on twenty four before I was pulled off him, my senses and control coming back as I stared at the now curled up Marco his face was going to be in the hospital for a while that was a fact.. and my knuckles drippin with a little blood from the split skin there.. They never ached so hard..  but as I rubbed them  I never loved the sore feeling from them more and I couldn&#39;t for the life of me understand why. Looking up I find my self looking up at a bear of a man looking down on me with a glint in his eyes I couldn&#39;t place but then I realized something.. He&#39;s a bear.. He&#39;s seriously a bear! I went white at the realization , looking back I seen brad looking at me with confusion and loathing in his eyes but the kid.. well lets just say he was looking at me like I was his knight and shining armor seeing through the cracks in my mask.. it was.. scary.. as I turn back to look at the black bear in front of me he was looking at me with respect and a grin that could have said it all.. He had me in a hell of a corner that was going to be a bitch to crawl out of and seeing his tag that said owner: Artur He looked me up and down before half snorting and pulling me towards his office and tossing me into a chair across from his desk chair I sat there wondering what&#39;s going to happen and as if reading my mind he started to talk &quot;You come into my establishment.. tormented a costumer.. and fought inside of said establishment... Now there&#39;s a couple of routes I&#39;m aloud to take in a situation like this more if either of them decides to sue.. but the more seeable ones are work off the money of three customers leaving before paying due to your little charades a bit ago. Another way is to serve me as my slave for a while...&quot; &#39;did he just grin?&#39; &quot; the last route for this is to have you banned from this island.. and report you to the proper authorities along with the little tidbit you turned out to be gay to your parents... Your choice boy..&quot; &#39;He&#39;s.. he&#39;s serious.. my only choice is to work off the payment, serve him, or to have my life I&#39;ve worked hard to cultivate lane to ruin for being a queer.. Damn that&#39;s fucked up but.. I guess I have no choice Jason finally voices his opinion &quot;I.. I guess.. that I&#39;ll have to choose..&quot;</p>
