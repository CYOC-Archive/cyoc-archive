<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;MAAAX?! Is everything OK?&quot; He heard Ashley call out which made him come to his senses and stop feeling himself for a second. It was then that Max noticed he didn&#39;t have strangely large pecks, they were small AA size breasts.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t panic,&#39; Max thought, &#39;It was a simple mistake, I just have to get back to the suit room and grab a male suit, simple right.&#39; Max got up and flushed the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, thanks Ashley. I just felt a little nauseous.&quot; Max said as he exited the stall<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a relief, you wouldn&#39;t be the first person to get sick after putting on an Animsuit for the first time.&quot; Ashley replied as she tossed Max the key to his locker. &quot;Now come on, you don&#39;t want to be late to orientation and training. Your uniform should be in the locker. Orientation starts in 10 minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Max responded and headed to his locker. Max opened his locker and thought &#39;Alright, first day orientation is only an hour long so I should be able to grab a male suit afterwards when the place is closing up.&#39; It was 4:00 pm right now and Atlas Shipping closed up at 5:00 pm so Max should be able to sneak into the suit room when less people are around.<br />
<br />
Inside Max&#39;s locker was a draw string bag that had his uniform and hair ties and hair pins. Max pulled out the uniform, it was a blue Sports Bra and blue spandex Sports Shorts, both which had the company logo stamped on the left side. Max turned to Ashley and said &quot;Is this the whole uniform?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley pulled up her uniform shorts and turned to Max &quot;Of coarse,&quot; she saw the concerned look on Max&#39;s face &quot;Don&#39;t worry you get use to it. Besides you don&#39;t want to have a heat stroke because you&#39;re all bundled up in a bunch of clothes and fur.&quot; Ashley then pull down her sports bra, &quot;Also, be sure tie up your tail and mane, you wouldn&#39;t want those to get caught on anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max shrugged and thought, &#39;What have I got to lose at this point.&#39; He pulled up the shorts and was surprised at how comfortable they felt and he noticed how weird if felt to where something without a penis and balls. He then pulled the sports bra on over his head and down onto his chest, after a bit of working it around he had it on comfortably.  He grabbed the hair ties next and wrapped a few around his tail, taking glances at Ashley to see how she did it.  Next Max grabbed the remaining hair ties and pins and began working on the mane. Ashley finished her mane and noticed Max struggling, &quot;Here let me help, the mane can be quite tricky the first few time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go.&quot; after about few minutes Ashley had finished. &quot;Damn, you look nice Max.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really!?&quot; Max said, tail waving a bit. Ashley grabbed him by the arm and pulled him over to a mirror in the locker room. Standing there in front of him was a 6&#39; 6&quot; female anthro-horse. She had beautiful peach fur with a gorgeous blonde mane and tail, well defined muscles with hips slightly wider than her waist, two petite A size breasts, &#39;wait did they get bigger or was it just the angle,&#39; wrapped up in a tight body hugging sports bra and tight sports shorts that gave her great definition and a tight looking butt. &quot;Wow... that&#39;s really me?&quot; Max was stunned at how sexy he looked.<br />
<br />
Ashley smiled, &quot;Come on now, your gonna be late.&quot; she grabbed Max&#39;s arm and pulled him away from the mirror. She led Max out of the locker room and down a hallway. As they approached the orientation room Ashley said, &quot;Listen, if you have any questions or need any help you can catch me in the locker room before you leave.&quot; Max nodded and Ashley headed off most likely to do her jobs. Max opened the door into the orientation room and stepped in.<br />
<br />
The room looked like a classroom but with some larger than normal furniture. He saw five other anthro-horses standing and sitting in the center of the room chatting. One was another female and the other four where all males. Max chuckled to himself when he saw the males in there uniforms. They were wearing no more than a blue speedo with ATLAS printed on the front. Max could nearly make out the entire male package under the speedo. &#39;God those are big bulges, those speedos look so good on them,&#39; Max began to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good peach,&quot; Max looked up to see who was talking to him. Max gasped when he saw who it was, it was the same mustang from in the locker room. &quot;Allow me to &#39;properly&#39; introduce myself,&quot; the mustang said with a wink, &quot;I&#39;m Jack... you are?&quot; he extended a hand to Max. Max could see one of the other guys give a chuckle, obviously he had already told some other dude what happened in the locker room. Meanwhile the other female just rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;MM..MM..Max, my name&#39;s Max.&quot; Max extended his hand to shake Jack&#39;s hand. Oh god did he have a strong grip, and those biceps are huge.  <br />
<br />
&quot;ALRIGHT, TAKE A SEAT EVERYONE!!&quot; A booming voice came from behind Max startling him. A massive anthro-clydesdale stallion came in through the door. &quot;Its Friday and I don&#39;t plan on staying late for a couple newbies&#39; orientation.&quot; Everyone quickly took there seats, Jack sat down right next to where Max was standing, but feeling awkward, Max sat down a few seats away. &quot;My name is Saul and I&#39;ll be your instructor through the orientation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orientation only ended up being 45 minutes and covered the basics, work ethics, the dos and don&#39;ts, safety, ect. but to Max it felt like an eternity. All he could think about was Jack back in the locker room. Before the words &quot;Your all free to go, see you Monday for training&quot; escaped Saul&#39;s mouth; Max was up and out the door. &#39;I have to get that male suit and get out of here fast&#39; Max thought. Max ran to his locker, Ashley was no where in sight luckily, he grabbed his backpack and headed to the door that led too the suits room. Max got to the door and pulled at it...&quot;DAMN IT!&quot; Max remembered that it was locked from this side. Luckily for Max, one of the few thing he picked up from school was how to pick a lock from his friends. They always picked other people&#39;s lockers to prank them. Max pulled out a hair pin from his mane and began to work on the lock... bingo, he was in.<br />
<br />
Max sneaked into the back room, careful not to alert the donkey-woman around the corner. When he was in he quickly started shuffling through the racks to find a male suit that was close to his weight. Max found a male, black, friesian horse suit with a minimum weight of 140 lbs. Max figured he could just try to put on at least 10-15 lbs over the weekend and he should be fine for a few days while wearing a larger suit. Max heard someone&#39;s hooves coming to the door so he quickly stuffed the suit into his backpack. He zipped up the backpack and the door clicked open. Standing in the doorway was...</p>
