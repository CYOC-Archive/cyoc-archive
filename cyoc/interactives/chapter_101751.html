<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric Anderson just sat there on the pool steps.<br />
Julie Stovall had told him everything, including the revelation that his eyes changing color from brown to deep sea blue whenever they were together confirmed the fact that they were destined soul mates.<br />
Yet until they declared and consummated their love, hormonal urges would build within them until...<br />
Now, despite only being a 14 year old Freshman, Eric had to make one of the most important decisions of his life.<br />
<br />
It seemed like a very long time passed as he thought things over, but it was actually just a little over a minute.<br />
Then Eric turned to look at Julie, but for the first time ever, that beautiful smile reserved just for him wasn&#39;t there.<br />
Her lower lip was starting to quiver, afraid of what his answer might be.<br />
With that, Eric knew what he had to do.<br />
He moved and tenderly kissed her.<br />
Julie returned the kiss, but was uncertain if this was a kiss of love or goodbye.<br />
“I won&#39;t pretend to understand all this,” began Eric afterward. “Fate, magic, science. Whatever is responsible, the one certainty I have is that my life has been a whole lot better since you entered it. I don&#39;t care whether or not this sounds selfish, but I <b>never</b> want to be without you. If you truly love me as much as I love you Julie Stovall, then please say yes and I&#39;ll do whatever I can to make what&#39;s about to happen as pleasurable and painless as possible for you.”<br />
“Oh Eric!” sobbed Julie, as tears started running down her cheeks. “I love you too my darling,” she cried, before kissing him again.<br />
<br />
The two young lovers just held each other close and exchanged kisses for awhile.<br />
It was a silent, tender time.<br />
Then Julie was totally surprised as she felt Eric remove her bikini top.<br />
He reached behind her and undid the tie. Wide eyed, she sat there in disbelief, unmoving, as Eric raised the neck strap over her head, then laid the wet cloth outside the pool edge as he looked down appreciatively at what was now uncovered.<br />
“Eric, I—” Julie started to say, but he silenced her with another gentle kiss.<br />
Then Eric kissed his way across her chin, down Julie&#39;s throat, and blazed a passionate trail to the valley in-between the orbs of her chest.<br />
He was truly amazed that her nipples got even harder than they already were after he lovingly kissed each one.<br />
At 14, Julie&#39;s breasts were naturally a small B, but her bosom expanded into a large C when she assumed her full were-mermaid form. Both sizes would change as she finished physically developing and maturing, but Eric didn&#39;t care.<br />
He titled his head and gently licked the nipple to his left, causing Julie to moan. Eric thought about everything he looked up online and all he discussed with his father as he gently blew on the breast, sending a shiver through his girlfriend before he started orally worshiping it again.<br />
As he began tenderly suckling what he could into his mouth and whirling his tongue around everything inside, Eric caressed the other breast with his right hand.<br />
“OOOOOOHHHHH..... EEEEERRRRRIIIIIIICCCCCC.....” moaned Julie deeply, never imagining such pleasures were possible as she pulled him closer and began running her hands through his brown hair.<br />
Eric&#39;s only response was to switch positions. He now began orally teasing and making love to Julie&#39;s left breast while he gently massaged her right.<br />
Julie started gasping and moaning louder.<br />
Then she shuddered.<br />
After that, Julie grew still as she leaned against her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Are you all right?”asked Eric, concerned about her well being.<br />
“I... I think so...”<br />
“What happened?”<br />
“I&#39;m not sure,” admitted Julie. “Could I have just had an orgasm?” she asked him, with a confused look on her face.<br />
“From what I just did?” he asked, confused too.<br />
“I read online it&#39;s possible for some women to achieve orgasms through breast stimulation, but I never found any details in regards to what the actual experience was supposed to be like.”<br />
“How do you feel?”<br />
“Wonderful,” Julie said with a smile, before kissing him again.<br />
But then she grew alarmed.<br />
<br />
“Eric, what are you doing?” Julie asked fearfully, as she felt him removing her bikini bottom.<br />
“Fighting my urges so I stay somewhat in control, trying to be romantic, wanting the moment to be as special for you as possible, and a whole lot of other stuff,” he replied, as Eric managed to pull the piece of cloth off her bottom and past Julie&#39;s legs, before it joined the matching swimsuit top on the outer edge of the pool.<br />
“Are you <i>absolutely</i> sure about this?” she asked him, while pulling Eric&#39;s face up to meet hers.<br />
“I know we&#39;re both scared, but what&#39;s even scarier to me is being without you. However, if it makes you feel any better about how serious I am in regards to wanting a VERY long term relationship with you...”<br />
With that, Eric Anderson stood up long enough to remove his swim trunks and laid them next to Julie&#39;s disgarded swimsuit, before sitting back down on the pool steps next to her, now just as naked as she was.<br />
<br />
“Oh you wonderful...” cried Julie, as she hugged him and laid her head on Eric&#39;s shoulder, but she couldn&#39;t resist taking a look at his penis. Now fully stimulated, it was just over five inches, which was about average size for a boy his age according to some of the medical websites she visited.<br />
Yet Julie had to fight herself to keep from touching it and advancing things sooner than they should be.<br />
“I really do love you Julie Stovall,” he whispered in her ear, while gently running his fingers through her hair. “It may not have been love at first sight as it was for you, but it&#39;s real, and growing stronger within me every day. You&#39;re smart, beautiful. The way your eyes twinkle whenever you show that smile that&#39;s just for me. You truly <i>are</i> the jewel of my heart,” said Eric, before kissing her again.<br />
Eric&#39;s left hand was behind her back, supporting Julie and keeping her body close to his as they continued to kiss, but soon Julie felt his right hand tentatively exploring between her legs.<br />
<br />
His fingertips gently caressed one inner thigh, and then the other before slowly, tantalizingly working their way across the smooth skin, drawing ever closer until just a single finger caressed the outer folds of Julie&#39;s vagina lips, traveling in a U shaped pattern from the top of one corner down and around to the top of the opposite side, before making the return trip to its starting point.<br />
There was no pressure, even when that finger tenatively explored the slit that was slowly opening in the center of her vagina. Eric kept just enough physical contact to maintain a tactile sensation between the two of them.<br />
He was tempted to let his finger discover what (if anything) might be inside that opening, but didn&#39;t want to take the risk of penetrating and hurting Julie prematurely and distracting her from the finale they both wanted.<br />

<br />
Julie stopped their kissing and gasped as Eric&#39;s finger went as far upward as it could, touching a fleshy protrusion that was not quite there before, but was now making its presence more prominent with continued stimulation.<br />
Knowing from his research that this was Julie&#39;s clitoris, Eric concentrated his finger&#39;s attention there.<br />
He completely circled it in a similar manner to his massaging of her vagina lips, even as Eric resumed holding and kissing his girlfriend.<br />
Then Julie shuddered against Eric in pleasure before breaking the kiss and moving her body just enough to lay her head on his shoulder again while spreading her legs a little farther open. She felt something special building within her once more, but this time it threatened to be even stronger than when Eric made love to her breasts.<br />
Julie shivered with joy in Eric&#39;s arms as she began moaning lowly in his ear, urging her boyfriend to continue what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Eric briefly considered stopping to lay down between his girlfriend&#39;s legs and try orally making love to her vagina to give her even more pleasure before Julie had to face the pain of losing her virginity.<br />
However, the fluids that came from that spot would still have the same trans-mutative properties regardless of how they were acquired; and Eric knew that Julie wanted the romance of being <i>directly</i> responsible for welcoming her soul mate into were-mer society, not any <i>in</i>direct creation. Having done his research, the small contact Eric was having now would require hours to take effect, but he hoped they would be long past that point by then.<br />
<br />
Instead, Eric&#39;s finger stayed on that one spot at the top of her vagina, stimulating it beyond belief.<br />
Julie&#39;s shivers of pleasure grew even stronger until it reached the point that she started to bite her lower lip.<br />
Her moaning grew louder as her shaking increased, in far greater proportion to what Eric thought was possible from the continued contact of just his finger upon Julie&#39;s clitoris.<br />
“Oh. Oh! OH! <i>OH!</i> <i><b>OH!</b></i>” she gasped, her body now quivering hard enough to start making little waves in the pool water around them.<br />
“Eeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiicccccccccc!” Julie practically screamed, as he felt her vagina start to secrete something in response to his actions.<br />
Remembering what his father advised about Julie needing to be “well lubricated,” Eric continued playing with her clitoris, recalling a few websites that referred to it as a woman&#39;s “love button”.<br />
Soon Eric had to resume kissing her to keep Julie from screaming out loud in pleasure and running the risk of someone coming to check on the noise.<br />
Neighbors were few in this part of Moon Lake, and while Eric doubted anyone was home to begin with, why take a chance?<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Julie pushed him away. There were tears of joy running down her face as she said, “P-please. I-I can&#39;t take anymore,” as the were-mermaid actually had to stop and catch her breath. “That was so, so...” realizing that she was truly at a lost for words.<br />
“<i>Anything</i> for you,” vowed Eric, tenderly kissing her again.<br />
There was only one act left, but Eric gave Julie a moment to rest, holding her in his arms.<br />
<br />
Then Eric whispered in Julie&#39;s ear, “Whenever you&#39;re ready,” unaware of the additional emotional pressure he had just placed upon his girlfriend.</p>
