<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke absentmindly scratched his chest as he said “Well, I tried all of the doors already, they are tightly shut. You got any idea?”<br />
“Well, let’s think” Matt said. “When this is some kind of science facility, there should be an emergency off or something. Let’s look for that!” As he moved, he was kind of feeling funny. His stomach was gurgling and felt like he drank too much water.<br />
The two men searched the room for a while until Matt finally turned around. “Well, I can’t find anything!” He really wasn’t feeling very well. His stomach felt bloated, his clothing was too loose and (although he would never have admitted that), he was feeling a pulling sensation in his crotch area. He was just about to head to the couch to sit down for a bit as he caught sight of Luke.<br />
“Dude! What’s wrong with your ears?!” He exclaimed and took a step towards him. Indeed, Luke’s ears had changed: They were thinner although significantly larger and flapped down. As Luke reached for them with his hand, he discovered that they were covered by short fur on the outside – a fact that was visible on the outside as well by their brown color. <br />
“What the-“ Luke exclaimed and had both hands on his ears now. He had other issues as well, his whole body was itching like mad and his clothes felt tight and constricting, but this was by far the strangest. “What’s happening to meee?”<br />
His last sentence ended in a kind of long drawn whine, but Matt didn’t pay attention. He was so lost in his observations that he only noticed his pants sliding off as they were already on the ground with his underwear. His legs and waist had lost significant girth, causing them to be unable to hold them up anymore.<br />
Instinktively, he covered his private parts with his hands only to find that being no problem at all – his dick had shrunk from his normal mediocre size to little more than a short nub with tiny balls. <br />
Matt was positively freaked out. “What the fuck is going on here?!” he exclaimed and looked back at Luke. It took him a moment before he realized he was staring at his chest – either Luke had grown or he had shrunk considerably in the last moments.<br />
“I don’t know!” Answered Luke, “But I’m itching all over and I feel really hot!” With that, he removed his sweater, exposing his upper body only clad in a t-shirt. What he saw let both men inhale sharply. Luke’s torso presented itself much more toned and muscular than he was used to, the t-shirt clinging tightly to his body. In the shirts collar and on his arms however, there were a million little hairs: fur. A slightly yellowish brown on his lower arms and coming out of the shirts collar and a darker brown on his shoulders and upper arms. Luke cleared his throat. “This… just… wow.” He stammered, his voice having dropped an octave. <br />
“Eh, I hope you don’t mind”, he continued and started to remove his shirt. That proved rather difficult however, as it was hugging his frame very tightly now. In the end, he had to resort peeling it off. Once he managed to get his head through the hole (his head seemed to have elongated), he touched his body in disbelief. The fur extended over his whole upper body, with the lighter tone on his chest and very defined stomach, and the darker one on the rest.<br />
“Oh boy…” he said and looked at Matt. It was only know that he noticed Matt’s head only coming to his belly, and that was not just because of him gaining a bit of height: Matt’s legs looked ridiculously short. His jeans had slid off and his torso had shrunk a bit too, albeit not as much as his legs. He still was covering himself and his face was deep red, which made Luke smile. He didn’t want Matt to feel bad.<br />
“You can touch it, if you want”, and gesticulated to his furry chest, and added “No need to blush, really – we’re both dudes, after all.” And really, Matt’s hands reached up and stroked his belly. It made Luke smile. Matt was so little (and not just in height) and he was so big and strong. That thought send a warm feeling through him. Matt was really kind of cute. <br />
Matt gulped nervously, as he touched the other man’s hair. He didn’t really think he had been blushing, but apparently it seemed that way. He should be way more freaked out, the rational voice in his mind remarked, but it felt rather right actually. At least, Luke didn’t seem to grow anymore, only his legs were shrinking away, he looked down, as he felt the cold ground touch his ass. He didn’t possess any legs anymore. He was just a torso sitting on the ground, yet strangely stable. His ass had relocated to beneath him, making a completely flat surface on the ground with his asshole in the middle. <br />
As he looked up again, his eyes came to level with Luke’s crotch. It was pretty obvious that Luke’s jeans were containing an erection right now, and a pretty big one too, the outline painfully visible. That must be terribly uncomfortable, he thought, and began to fiddle with Luke’s belt as if it was the most natural thing in the world.<br />
“Matt… What aaah”, Luke moaned, as the little man opened his belt and jeans, freeing his cock from the inside. The whole situation was turning him on incredibly, and Matt being so cute sitting there on the ground with his thin little arms was not helping much. It seemed like Matt was feeling the same, as he opened his mouth to an O-Shape and leaned in to his cock. It wasn’t obvious from Matt’s own dick however: Luke was looking all he could, but it seemed like the other man didn’t possess any genitalia whatsoever. <br />
Just as Matt’s mouth hit the tip of his cock, it felt electric. It took all the self-control he had not to thrust into that open mouth, as he moaned between clenched teeth: “Matt… Are you sure?” As the other one nodded, there was no holding back anymore. He thrust his rock hard cock into Matt’s round mouth and face-fucked his fellow student like a madman. In the erotic blur, he didn’t really notice as his hands, which he used to pull in Matt’s head turned to paws, or that his face surged out into a furred muzzle. He did however notice, that his cock had turned bright red with a knot on the end, and the furry sheath forming around it. Lost in the orgasmic feeling, he adjusted the back of his jeans slightly, allowing his newly formed tail to spring out, wagging madly.<br />
All that was nothing against what Matt was feeling. Only two or three thrusts into the face fucking, he felt like he was going to blow his load – only that he couldn’t, as he had no cock anymore. The feeling was orgasmic, sitting there on the ground, servicing Luke. The red tone of his head spread to the rest of his body, leaving him brightly red, as his neck vanished and his head now rested directly on his torso. Little did he notice that from one moment to the other, every single hair on his body fell to the ground, joining the heap of his clothes there. His skin was becoming harder and more metallic by the second and took one a riffled texture.<br />
He almost squirmed a bit, as a pipe invaded his ass from the bottom, only adding to the orgasmic feeling and filling his cylindrical form up with water. Finally, as Luke came into his mouth, his facial structure changed, leaving only the hole for the water hose there, with cum dripping lid on it in the same fire red as the rest of his hydrant body.<br />
Luke was breathing heavily before he looked down. What was he doing? Had he just fucked that hydrant? He shook his head. That was not what those things were there for.<br />
A grin crossed his canine snout. He had another use for it, anyway, as he lifted his muscular Rottweiler leg and let go a stream of hot yellow dog piss, drenching the red hydrant and marking it with his scent. It took a whole while of pissing before he sighed happily, his tail wagging and zipped up his jeans. It was so hard to find good hydrants these days.<br />
Inbetween this all, the exit door had slid open without any of them noticing. The muscular anthro Rottweiler left the room, wagging and already thinking about where to next mark his territory. Only a red fire hydrant was left in the room, fixated to the ground and drenched in dog piss.</p>
