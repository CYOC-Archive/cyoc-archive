<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Barnes ran our patrol car's siren as we rushed to the school where the Summer Sun program was being run in. Technically it wasn't an official call and we could potentially get in trouble for unnecessarily running the siren, but Molly was just going into labor. I felt that I had to be there. To be with her, and Officer Barnes seemed to know that. Some of it seemed fairly instinctual for him in that regard, which I supposed was possible. Officer Jenkins had been fired from her position in the Spokane Police Department for her mistakes at a Christmas party and becoming pregnant as a result. I knew that Officer Howard had hired her as Columbia Falls' desk officer and that Officer Barnes had been there to help her. What I didn't have was where Megan's birthday was in all of that. And I couldn't remember if Officer Jenkins had moved to Columbia Falls before Megan was born. If that was the case, that would mean that Officer Barnes had probably been there when Megan was born, but I couldn't remember for certain as to whether or not that was the case.<br />
<br />
And considering that I was in a rush to be there for Molly, I wasn't in much mood to try and remember the timeliness that Officer Barnes and Jenkins had given me for when and how they met. My mind was focused on one thing. My wife. Officer Barnes pulled up to the front door of the school, and as soon as the car stopped, I was out like a shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, George,&quot; Officer Barnes called to me, using the more non-professional tone that he normally didn't use when in uniform.<br />
<br />
I turned back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I can't stay,&quot; Officer Barnes said with a sigh, &quot;but before I go, I have one thing... from everyone at the station... congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a smile and nod and then rushed into the school. I made it mast a window to the office area where I saw a nearly out of breath aide practically needing Mrs. Fitzpatrick to hold her up. The aide was a bit older then some others and wasn't in the best of shape, and in the meantime the main secretary was on the phone with the hospital.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Molly okay?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would assume she is... or at least as fine as a woman in labor can be,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick answered, &quot;we've called the Kalispell hospital... but I'm afraid we've been having to guess on some of the details as they've been asking for details that we're having to second guess based on what Molly has told us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ask for an ambulance?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
At this point the main secretary spoke up, &quot;they're reporting that unless she's fully dilated and you can see the head or feet coming out, they won't send an ambulance.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a bit of a sigh, but that was what I expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can get her to the hospital,&quot; I sighed, &quot;what room is she in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take you,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick answered and then instructed the secretary, &quot;open the doors for the officer...&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick then turned to Molly's aide, &quot;Winifred, you'd best go out to the play area and keep an eye on the group Molly was looking after. The group that is scheduled to be out there will be okay, but we don't want to over tax the teachers there already.&quot;<br />
<br />
The aide, Winifred nodded and began to make her way out to the doors that would lead to the playground area. I, meanwhile, followed Mrs. Fitzpatrick to the room where Molly was supposed to be. I found her seated on the floor and her back was against the wall. I noticed a few small scuff marks in the carpet that would indicate that Molly had originally been near the desk when labor hit. Joseph Patten was kneeling by her and letting her rest one paw on his knee while patting her shoulder reassuringly with one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;George!&quot; Molly gave a grunt as I came down to kneel on her other side.<br />
<br />
I hugged her and nuzzled her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly, are you okay?&quot; I asked, &quot;How close together are the contractions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They just started,&quot; Molly said weakly, &quot;I was going through the day's activity when it hit me... knocked me off my feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you walk?&quot; I asked, &quot;the hospital won't be sending an ambulance to get you to Kalispell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Patten gasped sounding more surprised then I had thought he might be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless our cubs are already on the way out, it won't be an emergency,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only just started,&quot; Molly repeated, &quot;but it hurts BAD when they hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if Molly's only just started having contractions, we have about twenty hours before it'll be over,&quot; I told him, &quot;and Kalispell is only about twenty miles away. All we need is to get Molly to our Transit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your folks should be on their way,&quot; Patten then said after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll probably see them when we get Molly to our &quot;van&quot;,&quot; I nodded and looked down to Molly, &quot;can you stand up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Molly said weakly.<br />
<br />
I then offered her my arms and let her pull herself up. Doing so nearly pulled me over, but I recovered and we managed to get Molly to her feet, though it was also fairly obvious that she was pretty shaky at the moment. That was likely if she was starting to have contractions. I let Molly lean heavily on me, while Mrs. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Patten stood by, looking ready to catch Molly if she had another contraction and was forced down in a way that I couldn't keep her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are your keys, Molly?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're in my purse,&quot; Molly said looking to the desk, where her purse was sitting quietly on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick offered and picked up and proceeded to follow us out as I began to help Molly make her way to parking lot.<br />
<br />
Patten followed behind for a little ways while we made our way out into the hallway. He looked a little bit nervous and yet a bit hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for all your help,&quot; I said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did what I could,&quot; Patten admitted, &quot;I'd wish I could do more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll come see my cubs when they're born?&quot; Molly asked, her breathing a bit easier now as she was between contractions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try,&quot; Patten promised.<br />
<br />
The procession out to where Molly had parked our Transit was a relatively slow one. This was mostly for Molly's ease and to make sure that she wasn't strained any more then what labor would be doing to her anyway. My folks weren't there yet as we arrived at the van, but for the moment that wasn't a concern. Mrs. Fitzpatrick dug Molly's keys out of her purse and then unlocked the doors. I then helped Molly up into the front passenger seat and helped her buckle in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that okay?&quot; I asked her, &quot;it's not too tight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine, George,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;Let's just hurry to the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We still need to wait until my folks arrive,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
I backed up and let Mrs. Fitzpatrick then come up and hand Molly her purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you, dear,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick said to her, &quot;and don't worry. I'm sure you'll be a wonderful mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
It was that moment that my parents arrived in the parking lot in their car. My mother was driving and pulled into a nearby visitor's parking space. Once she came to a stop, she leaned out and looked to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she okay?&quot; Polly Wayne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's doing fine,&quot; I answered, &quot;but it would appear that today is the day. We're getting ready to head to Kalispell now. If you can follow me, I'll take you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Polly Wayne answered, &quot;lead the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and got ready to head over to the Transit's driver's side when I was met by Mrs. Fitzpatrick, who was still there. She had one hand held up, and in it were Molly's keys.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd think you'll need these,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick spoke.<br />
<br />
I quietly took the keys and then moved to get into the driver's seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; I said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no problem,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick said politely, &quot;Drive safe, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and started the Transit's engine. We were soon driving on out way to Kalispell where Molly's and my cubs would be born.</p>
