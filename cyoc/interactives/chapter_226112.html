<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while, Sarah looks at Jeff, “IF I say “yes”, and you somehow transform into Amy, I want you to be aware that you, like the original, HAVE to do what ever I say without question!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I’m aware of that,” he says, “everyone who knows you, Amy and your friends, all know that Amy does anything you say, because she wants to please you and not make you in some way mad. I promise to try my best, but if I get something wrong or something confuses me, please don’t get mad.”<br />
<br />
“How about,” Sarah says, “rather than risking you fucking up, after you transformed into Amy, I’ll explain how it works. I’ll also set a few rules, also you need to know how she talks, walks, you need to have some knowledge of woman’s fashion, and so much more. I don’t want you to ruin our reputations.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I’m not planning to do such a thing,” he says, “I promise to follow your lead and rules you’ll set.”<br />
<br />
Sarah looks at Jeff, she then sighs, “fine, I guess for a day, I’ll be okay with a boy transforming into “Amy”,” she says, “I hope I won’t regret it.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “I promise,” he says, “by the end of the day, you’ll be a lot happier.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll see,” the girl says, still not convinced, ‘I can’t believe I’m letting myself been talked into some loser-sci-fi-shit by this nerd,’ she thinks to herself, “so, how are you going to transform into her? It’s not like you can copy-paste her body onto yours!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “well, there are three way to do this,” he says, “the first and second option are that one of us edits my file. The third is: there is a search function on the App, that allows me to search for an individual, and save that person’s body in the App without needing to scan him or her.”<br />
<br />
Sarah thinks for a while, ‘I’d love to edit the nerds file,’ she thinks to herself, ‘that would give me the chance to… change “Amy” to my liking. But, I doubt he’ll hand me his phone, I can’t blame him, I’m not easy to trust.’<br />
<br />
The girl looks at Jeff, “I think the fastest way would be the search function,” she says, “once you have transformed, we’ll just edit your file to match the original’s.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I agree,” he says, the teen looks down at his phone and opens the search function, “her full name is “Amanda “Amy” Thoams”, correct?”<br />
<br />
“Correct,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and types the name into the search bar, after confirming it the App gives off a “ping” sound, “wow, that was quick,” he says, “okay, got her, now to save her body in the App and… done.”<br />
<br />
“So, Amy, or rather her appearance is stored in the App,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“So, what now?”<br />
<br />
“Now, I’ll go to the “saved bodies” option, select “Amanda” and finally select myself, then all I have to do is confirm and I’ll transform into her,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“What about your clothes,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“No worries,” Jeff says, “I can have the App adjust my clothes, while my body transforms, my clothes will adjust to my new gender.”<br />
<br />
“So, you male uniform will end up becoming the female’s,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yes,” he says, “so, ready for “Amy” to “show up”?”<br />
<br />
Sarah actually is starting to feel nervous, on one hand she feels disgusted that a BOY will be transforming into her female friend, but on the other hand, the girl had planned a fun day to spend with Amy, but since Amy fell ill, those plans were out of the window, but now, with Jeff becoming “Amy”, those plans were back in play.<br />
<br />
The girl sighs, “I guess I am,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, he then types into his phone, once everything is set, the teen takes a deep breath, “well, here goes nothing,” he says and taps the confirm button.<br />
<br />
After confirming, Jeff feels a tingle run through his body, causing him to shiver, “okay, that felt weird,” he says.<br />
<br />
“What felt weird,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I just felt a pins-and-needles-sensation run through my body,” Jeff says, “according to the manual, that means that the transformation, or change, is about to start.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Sahra says, raising an eye brow, “you don’t look any different than before.”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “patience,” he says, “it’s not like a magic trick, you know: abracadabra, poof of smoke, then suddenly I’m a girl.”<br />
<br />
Sarah just rolls her eyes, “yeah, yeah,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff then notices something, “um, Sarah,” he says, “is it just me, or do you seem taller?”<br />
<br />
Sarah looks, her eyes widen when she realizes that Jeff seems at least half a head shorter than before, then she notices that Jeff’s hair, which is still blond, seem a little longer, “no… way,” the girl breaths as she watches the boy slowly transform into “Amy”.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly doubles over, groaning, “th-that feels… so… weird,” he says, “a-almost like… my insides are on… fire!”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I can feel my… organs shifting,” Jeff says, “s-something… something is growing in my… stomach… pushing my insides out of the… way. I… I think… I think it’s… the… my womb forming! I… I can even feel my… boy-parts shrinking… my balls are… being pulled back into my body!”<br />
<br />
Sarah blushes, “to many details I’d rather NOT know,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes himself, “s-sorry,” he says, his hair has by now grown past his shoulder blades and styled themselves into twin tails. The transforming boy then feels the pain in his abdomen subside, he straitens himself, looking down at his pants, no bulge is to be seen, “welp, looks like I’m all “girl” down there,” he says, “feels so weird. Feels as if I’m “missing” something, but… it actually feels… um… nice not to have something… um… dangling between my legs.”<br />
<br />
“You know, I’m still here, right,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes and rubs the back of his head, “he… s-sorry Sarah,” he says, “it’s… it’s just so… well… new and alien to me.”<br />
<br />
Sarah simply nods, then she notices Jeff’s shirt starting to puff out, the girl actually grins at this, “looks like your boobies are forming,” she says, pointing.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks down at his chest, his eyes widening when he watches the breasts grow from his body, stopping at a nice B-cup size, “damn, they look bigger than I thought,” he says.<br />
<br />
Sarah snorts, “not as big as mine,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff opens his mouth to respond, but just then he feels his adams apple desolve, causing him to cough, “I… *cough*… think… *cough*… my voice is… *cough*… changing!”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “you sound more like Amy now,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff clutches his throat with a small feminine hand, “feels weird having a high voice,” he says. Then he feels his bum grow more round and firm, while his hips widen, giving him a beautiful hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
Sarah actually smiles, “you are looking better with every second,” she says.<br />
<br />
“I can feel the change slowing down,” the “girl” says, “only thing left now are my clothes,” he adds.<br />
<br />
Just as Jeff says that, his clothes suddenly glow white, both watch with their eyes wide in amazement as Jeff’s clothes change into the girl’s school uniform: miniskirt, the shirt and vest taken on a more feminine appearance and the tie a little smaller. Jeff then feels his boxers become panties and a bra forming around his new breasts, then it’s all over.<br />
<br />
“So, I’m now “Amy”… this is… so weird,” he, now she, says. The “girl” then looks up at Sarah, “so… um… what do you think? How do I look,” she asks, sounding a little nervous, being suddenly shorter than Sarah, causes the “girl” to feel a little intimidated.<br />
<br />
Sarah is at a loss for words, the pink haired girl is stunned at the fact that a boy, she dislikes, suddenly is replaced by her friend. The girl walks around “Amy”, taking her whole body in, “I… I can’t believe it actually worked,” she says, stopping in front of the “girl”, “this is so crazy! If I wouldn’t have witnessed it with my own eyes…!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “yeah,” she says, “I got to be honest. Being a girl doesn’t feel as weird as I thought, I mean, the only difference is that I have boobs and no… you know… but other than that… this body feels totally natural.”<br />
<br />
Sarah scowls, “just don’t think you can “investigate” your BORROWED body, just because it’s “yours”,” she says, “that means: NO TOUCHIES!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” rolls her eyes, “really, Sarah,” she says, “you really think I’m that kind of guy?”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t all males perves,” Sarah asks, “I mean… you are always hanging around the biggest perv in this town.”<br />
<br />
The “little girl” snorts, “that doesn’t make ME a perv,” she says, “I may be curious, BUT I would not dare doing anything with this body WITHOUT permission. So, you don’t have to worry, besides, I’ll be back to my old “nerdy”-self before I need to get ready for bed.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll take your word,” Sarah says, “but, it’ll take more if you want me to trust you, which means: I’m not letting you out of my sight!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” raises an eye brow and smirks, “but Sarah, you NEVER let Amy out of your sight anyway!”<br />
<br />
Sarah scowls, “THAT is beside the point,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Amy” giggles, “anyway, we still have some stuff to discuss and we need to adjust my file so that I can do my “Amy-job” appropriately.”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “okay, make sure that you change your personality, Amy is shy and obedient, she is straight and attracted to athletic boys, she is single and finally I want you to add “female fashion” and how to put on and remove a bra to your knowledge.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” frowns, “do I really have to be straight? Why can’t I just be lesbian? I mean… I don’t want to risk falling for some boy!”<br />
<br />
Sarah rolls her eyes, “well, you ARE a girl now, Amy,” she says, “I’d rather you not be lesbian, because I KNOW who you really are, and I don’t want to end up in bed with some loser, and if you EVER tell ANYONE that I’m a lesbian… I’ll make your life miserable! NO ONE knows, not even the real Amy! Also, I doubt you’ll fall for a boy, you’ll be back to your boring boy-self this evening!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” sighs, “okay, I guess I’ll survive a day as a straight girl, and I promise not to tell anyone,” she says, typing in the change, “anything else,” she then asks.<br />
<br />
Sarah thinks for a while, ‘if something is not accurate, I can still have her change it later,’ she thinks to herself, ‘that App is amazing, I need to get my hands on that App, either copy it over or download my own.’<br />
<br />
“Sarah,” the “girl” asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry, I was just thinking if there’s anything else,” Sarah says, “but, I think it’ll do for now.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “okay, if anything needs to be adjusted later, just let me know,” she says, confirming the changes.<br />
<br />
“Will do,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, then she groans as she feels the new knowledges flooding into her mind, “whoa… now I know all sorts of stuff about clothes I would otherwise never consider or care about,” she then says, her eyes wide, “I mean… stuff like… what’s new and what’s outdated.”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “that is a good start,” she says, “now, come on AMY, we don’t want to be late for class.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” the “little girl” says, “let’s go. Oh, by the way… I haven’t set a timer, so I’ll stay “Amy” for as long until I manually transform myself back. That way we won’t need to watch the time.”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “good, because I really don’t want to be under any sort of stress,” she says, “before you ask, no, I am NOT happier and I don’t feel better than before. BUT we’ll see how the day turns out.”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amy” nods, “alright,” she says, with that the two head to their first class.</p>
