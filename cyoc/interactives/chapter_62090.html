<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I saw on the news last night that the people suing Ms. Washburn over the distribution of the serum won,&quot; Officer Jenkins said to me as I made my way in to the station the next morning.<br />
<br />
Things were likely to be quiet. We would hold MacClure until the first day of his trial began and a bail was posted. After that point, if he could meet the price of the bail, he'd be in his own custody and responsible for bringing himself to court. If he couldn't, we'd continue to hold him until the trial was complete. However since a date for the opening of MacClure's trial hadn't been set yet, we didn't entirely know what we would be doing beyond basic patrolling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw it too,&quot; I replied, &quot;both Molly and I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ha, and what did you think?&quot; Officer Jenkins wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;About the results?&quot; I shrugged, &quot;I would have preferred that Leona won... but that is my personal preference, obviously... but I suppose the result of the lawsuit is acceptable. I personally feel there is a risk of danger in doing this, but the government will try to regulate the distribution of the serum to make sure that no one becomes an animal that would not survive at the size of a human at least... or becomes an animal that would have to live in the ocean, which we've thoroughly polluted...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that a whale, fish, or shark people could potentially be caught in fishing nets,&quot; Officer Jenkins commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, &quot;and the government will regulate against that... and maybe with their regulations, the people who become animals will know precisely what they'll be getting into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still don't agree with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The people that filed the lawsuit filed it because they think being animal people will make them happy,&quot; I replied, &quot;giving up one's species won't make you happy. Happiness is an emotion, not a physical state. I do not NEED to be a tiger to be happy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins then nodded for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But with the regulations,&quot; I commented, &quot;that could make it acceptable... after all, I may feel some strong instinctual urges, but I'm not lost to them. The next wave of animal people won't be any different, and thanks to the regulations, they will know what is coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That almost sounds supportive,&quot; Officer Jenkins quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't agree with their position, but from what I've seen,&quot; I sighed, &quot;their representatives made a good and logical argument. I can't argue with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins nodded, &quot;So, for the sake of a joke, George, would you think a Cheetah person would make a good cop? They wouldn't need a car for high speed pursuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only for short distances,&quot; I replied, &quot;cats aren't known for their stamina... and how do you expect a Cheetah person to stop a car if it catches it? I doubt I could stop a moving car if I tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hadn't thought of that,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied with a shrug.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Officer Howard was waiting for us when we entered the station. He brought things quickly to business and avoided anyone from commenting further on the news results of Leona's lawsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Officer Jenkins, Officer Wayne,&quot; he spoke as we checked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, sir,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;How has the timing for the trial going, sir?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually have a start date for that now,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;I just got that call. The trial will be in Kalispell, with the first day of the hearings at eleven AM this Friday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friday, sir?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a problem with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; I answered, &quot;just curious as to why they're starting the trial on what is the end of the work-week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the way the ball rolls sometimes,&quot; Officer Howard shrugged, &quot;Not every court case begins on a Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins and I both nodded in response to the comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;it's the way curiosity can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don't get curious about an electric socket,&quot; Officer Howard replied with a chuckle, &quot;that could quite literally kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I managed a slight chuckle and nodded in response to the joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will be on patrol duty until then, sir?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;you will go with the official guard for MacClure Friday morning, and will be there for the trial, since Officer Wayne's ears will be needed... or at least what they heard will be needed to testify. Until then, you two can get back to what is your routine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins nodded. Officer Howard then dismissed us to our work, and we set out to our patrol car. We found it where we left it. In need of some cleaning, but needing nothing else.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here we go,&quot; Officer Jenkins gave a soft chuckle.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of the week before the trial went by fairly quietly. Officer Jenkins and I ran our patrols, which came across very little in the way of action. The worst was a case of speeding in which the person attempted to give Officer Jenkins the fine payment before she could return to our patrol car. I fielded more questions from people curious about the results of Leona's lawsuit and my opinion on it. I answered these questions as honestly as I could, without sounding offensive or irritating. I also found out that Molly had fielded several similar questions from the staff at the school. She also took a few questions from students, but from what she told me, they were mostly asking her if she would transform them into tigers. I guessed that was a sign of how much the kids liked her.<br />
<br />
On the Friday of the trial, Officer Jenkins and I rode down to Kalispell in our patrol car following the car being driven by two of the officers that had participated in the search. It gave us the manpower to make sure that MacClure couldn't do anything. Once there, MacClure was lead to the defendant's chair where he met with his lawyer. Officer Jenkins and I took seats behind the prosecution's table.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, the bailiff entered the courtroom to announce the judge for the case.<br />
<br />
&quot;The case of Columbia Falls versus Dusty MacClure will come to order,&quot; the bailiff spoke, &quot;All rise for the honorable Gregory Pax.&quot;<br />
<br />
We all stood up as the judge who had heard Ebenezer and William Smith's case entered and took his seat. He gave me no second look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be seated,&quot; Judge Pax spoke.<br />
<br />
Once everyone sat down, Judge Pax began the official business of the trial.<br />
<br />
&quot;The prosecution may state the charges,&quot; Judge Pax spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;The listed charges include Murder, Assaulting an Officer, and Illegal Weapons Possession,&quot; the DA answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the plea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not guilty, your honor,&quot; Dusty MacClure spoke for himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Judge Pax replied, &quot;the prosecution may state its case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor, we are here today to try a man who murdered a fairly close personal friend over an argument when the two men had a falling out over the actions of Pierre Beauregard,&quot; the DA spoke, &quot;given the character of the defender, it is likely that the argument was preplanned, making any violent actions resulting from it, unavoidable. And it is character that is at the heart of this case, ladies and gentlemen, for in the course of the search for evidence that would confirm the defendant as guilty or innocent, when it became clear that evidence that could convict him was discovered, he assaulted the female officer in the hopes that he would be freed in doing so. The attempt failed, and the investigating officers found evidence of just how violent the defendant is... with a virtual stockpile of illegal arms and ammunition kept on the property.&quot;<br />
<br />
The DA then looked up to Judge Pax, &quot;and all of that paints the image of the character we are trying. An opinionated and violent man, who easily snapped when things got tough. And it is that character that is on trial here today.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the DA sat down. As he did so, MacClure's lawyer stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor, the present case is a misunderstanding,&quot; the attorney spoke, &quot;the weapon used was stolen... there was no witness to the actual murder... and as for assaulting an officer... that was a mere mistake where my client became frightened and he regrets it deeply. He wishes for the true murderer to be found, but he did not get the chance to help find the murderer... and with the weapon's charge, I believe the court should review the Second Amendment... but with it all being a misunderstanding, I move that an easy bail be set and we may work together to find the real killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bail is posted at six hundred dollars,&quot; Judge Pax answered, &quot;we will reconvene on Monday to begin the presentation of evidence, both for and against the defendant.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, he brought his gavel down and the day's hearing ended.</p>
