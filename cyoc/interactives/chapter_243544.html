<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back at the Inn&#39;s bar, both Amy and Jeff were taking their sweet time at the table, waiting until later in the night to settle into their room and take a nice long soak in the room&#39;s personal Jacuzzi.  However, that didn&#39;t mean that they would be hungry as they decided to order their entrees after having nachos.  For Jeff, it is a meaty burger with the works and fries on the side, drinking a tall glass of beer.  For Amy, she has the healthier option of a chicken Caesar salad and a glass of Merlot.  Clearly, the alcohol in their bodies was starting to kick in as the two of them were starting to get a little smitten to each other.<br />
<br />
Jeff especially as the combination of the cocktail and beer was affecting his own self control with Amy.  He knows that she was his sister, he knows it feels wrong to fall in love with her despite what they were just yesterday.  But the more he drinks, the more that barrier continues to disintegrate.  Combine that with the fact that the thought of them in the jacuzzi would make his nether regions stir.  With his shoulder on the table and head on the hand, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel turned on by Amy&#39;s lustful demeanor, so much so that the thoughts of memories of their old lives were starting to get fainter and fainter as the alcohol and metal restraints beginning to take a toll on him.<br />
<br />
Amy turned to see him starring on and could tell that he was a little out of it.  &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked with her voice a little slurred.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled and was a little red in the face as he answered, &quot;Nothing, dear...  Just couldn&#39;t help but to admire how beautiful you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy blushed a little as she leaned back and swipe her hair to the side while crossing her legs very seductively.  &quot;Ah...  Jeffy...  You know how to treat a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down as his half eaten burger, she noticed the side of fries and came up with a good idea.  Leaning forward, she grabbed one of the fries with her fingers and presented it to her husband.  &quot;You hungry big boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to the fry and nodded in response.  With a devilish smirk, she slowly placed the fry in between her massive breasts and got up to bend down close to his face.  &quot;Then what are you waiting for.  Dig in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could see Amy&#39;s huge assets with the fry in between and could feel another stiffy happening.  But with his drunk nature and the husband side controlling him, he slowly moved his head towards Amy&#39;s chest and got a good bite out of the fry while nestling his face within her huge boobs.  Amy moaned a bit while Jeff was making muffling sounds on top of her assets.  Quickly, he got his face off her chest and got the fry, sucking what&#39;s left in his mouth and was satisfied.  &quot;That was so...good...&quot; he said chewing and then drinking his beer.<br />
<br />
Amy was also satisfied and decided to say, &quot;If you think that&#39;s good.  Just wait until we&#39;re at the jacuzzi tonight.  I have another idea to wedge something else in between my beauties, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
That soon caused Jeff to nearly choke on his beer and coughed, knowing what she meant by that.  Amy saw that and asked, &quot;You&#39;re okay, Jeffy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff pounded his chest and cleared his throat, saying.  &quot;Yeah...  I&#39;m good...  I...  I need to use the rest room.  Wait here for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled and held her wine to say, &quot;Oh, darling...  I&#39;m not going anywhere...&quot; she soon sipped her wine as Jeff left to take a piss.<br />
<br />
Finished drinking her wine, she rolled her eyes and said, &quot;Silly Jeffy...&quot; before going back to sipping.  What she didn&#39;t know is that a group of college boys were close by as they dared one of them to do something risky.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
In the restroom, Jeff left the stall after pissing most of what he drank.  Getting to the sink, he watched his hands before splashing his face with water.  Turning off the faucet, he looked to himself and could see that he was a little shitfaced.  But in his mind, his teenage side was trying to process what he just witnessed.<br />
<br />
&#39;What is wrong with me?  Saying those things to Amy, giving out advice to a young couple, imagining use in the jacuzzi, even eating a fry between her breasts.  It&#39;s like I am not myself.  Why&#39;s that?&#39;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the husband side rang out in his head.<br />
<br />
&#39;Because you&#39;re in love.&quot;<br />
<br />
The physical Jeff shook his head and he teen side knew what is going on.<br />
<br />
&#39;Look, I don&#39;t know who you are or how you got in my head, but you have overstayed your welcome.  Get out!&#39;<br />
<br />
The husband side chuckled and said to him, &#39;Don&#39;t you get, little man, I am you, the real you, the one you keep fighting against.  Why are you struggling?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Because you&#39;re not me.  I&#39;m the real me.  The one that uses the Chronivac just to give mom a life of a teenager.  It was meant to be just she and I as twins, but then things escalate and now...&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You are a devoted husband and father with a lovely wife and a sweet teenage daughter.  Admit it.  You like this life.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s not true.  Amy is my younger sister, she&#39;s not ready for adult things and now thanks to the Chronivac, it turned her into...&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;One hot wife that is madly in love with you.  You saw how she was excepting that life you gave her.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Cause she wasn&#39;t aware of any of it.  Only me and Jamie are aware of what is happening and yet all the memories we use to have...&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Are becoming just flights of fancy?  Of course they are.  You feel it.  The more you are in my body, the more you accept it.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s my body!  Not yours!  And I want you out, NOW!&#39;<br />
<br />
The husband side chuckled and told him, &#39;You say it now, but soon you will enjoy it as much as I do.  And when that day comes, you and Amy will have the greatest time of your lives.  Enjoy the ride.&#39;<br />
<br />
The voiced in his head stopped as Jeff still stare at the mirror.  He has no idea what is going on, but he knew that the Chronivac has something to do with it.  He needs to get to the bottom of it before these effects are permanent.  But for now, he needs to be with his wife.  Or was it his sister?<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Back at the table, Amy was waiting for Jeff to return as she was eating her salad.  Tapping her fingernails, she sighed and said, &quot;Hmm...  Jeff is taking his sweet time in the restroom.  Wonder what he&#39;s doing?&quot;  A thought occurred to her as she bit her lip.  &quot;Mmm...  Probably coming up with provocative moves for us to do in the jacuzzi.  I can only imagine what he has in store for me...&quot;  She rubbed her pussy and thought of things to do tonight as well.  Suddenly, her thoughts were interrupted with a voice close be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey good looking...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy stopped feeling herself and tilt her head to the side to see a young college guy next to her with a lean athletic body, buzzed black hair, and chiseled looks.  She starred at him and was silent for a bit before asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...  Can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The college guy just walked over to the side and leaned down with his elbows on the table, trying to act all sware.  &quot;Oh...  It&#39;s nothing.  I just want to ask, are those things real, or have you gotten implants.&quot; he asked pointing at her chest.<br />
<br />
Amy wasn&#39;t amused by him and looked to her own chest, placing on hand on it and squeezing it saying, &quot;Oh, there&#39;s nothing fake about these knockers, boy.  They are 100% natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
The college student look at her squeezing her breast and asked, &quot;Can I feel them too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy was starting to get uncomfortable and told him, &quot;Sorry, boy.  You&#39;re not allowed to touch these beauties, only my husband is allowed to touch them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, &quot;I saw your husband.  Definitely not interested in what you are planning to do for tonight.  But for me, I have a clear schedule tonight.  Let&#39;s say you and I go somewhere and get a little naughty.  You know I&#39;m into MILFs with fuckable bods.&quot; he told her, leaning closer to her face.<br />
<br />
Amy was starting to feel awkward as she tried to tell him to leave.  &quot;What part of no don&#39;t you understand.  I&#39;m married and have a kid.  I&#39;m not interested in you dumb jocks.  Buzz off!&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy though was starting to get too close to Amy and said with a chuckle.  &quot;Ah...  Playing hard to get, huh?  I love it when a lady got some bite.  Come here and give me a smooch.&quot;  He soon placed his lips together and was about to plant one on her as Amy was holding back.  But just as things were about to get a little cringy...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
He stopped and turned to the direction of the voice, only to see Jeff there with a pissed off look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; he asked with a booming and pissed off voice.<br />
<br />
The guy sighed and got off Amy&#39;s back as he walked down with a bit of swagger.  &quot;Why, I was just trying to woo this find lady here.  I mean, why waste time with a stick in the mud like you when you have a hottie like me?  You feel what I&#39;m saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t buying it as he cracked his knuckles and said, &quot;No...  I don&#39;t...  That&#39;s my wife you&#39;re trying to woo and I think you overstayed you&#39;re welcome.  Now leave or you&#39;ll regret it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy laughed it off and was woozy, probably because he drank too much, and told him, &quot;Listen bud, I don&#39;t know who you are, but the lady needs a real man to comfort her.  Not some middle age, overweight looser to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, Jeff punched the guy in the face when he got too close and he was knocked down and knocked out completely.  Jeff looked down at the unconscious person and yelled to him, &quot;I&#39;m her fucking husband you prick!  You touch her, you get knocked out!  Now leave or else!&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy was a little woozy and slowly scampered away from his guys that were laughing their asses off.  Jeff looked on and realized that the guy was hitting on Amy on a dare.  With that, he pointed to the group and told them, &quot;And if any of you even think of hitting on my wife, you all will be eating food through a straw.  You got me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The group heard that and froze in their tracks, nodding their heads knowing they don&#39;t want to mess with him.  Two of them soon picked up the semi-conscious guy and they all left the bar, hoping to get away from him.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a sigh and turned to Amy to see her a little startled at first.  But he approached her and placed his hands on hers to ask, &quot;Hey, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked up to him and gave a warm smile, &quot;Better now thanks to you.  You are such a hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and said, &quot;Hey, as long as I&#39;m around no one would lay a finger you your precious body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy soon got off them chair and embraced her husband with a warm hug.  Jeff was caught by surprise, but ultimately hugged her back.  He didn&#39;t know it was the teenager side taking over wanting to protect his little sister, or the husband side wanting to protect his wife.  Either way, he would protect Amy no matter what.  Looking to her, he said, &quot;Maybe we should pay the bill and return to our room early.  We had quite the first day here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked to him with loving eyes and said, &quot;Yes...  Let&#39;s...&quot;  The two soon got close to each other&#39;s lips and gave a long and warm kiss, knowing fully well that they had quite the day.</p>
