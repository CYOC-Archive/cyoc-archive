<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan Lawson parked his jeep at the curb in front of the Anderson&#39;s house. After having to deal with his father, let alone finding out that Mike Lawson intended to stay in Moon Lake at least through Friday morning in hopes of finding a new place to live closer to his remaining family (&quot;If you get into any more trouble, you&#39;ll need local back up fast!&quot; was Mike&#39;s explanation) Evan was looking forward to dessert.<br />
In truth, what he was REALLY looking forward to was &quot;dessert&quot;, picturing his choice of prime were-female pussies (his wife&#39;s, Martha Anderson&#39;s, along with their neighbors Samantha and Frances Twist) to eat. He hoped to at least coax Martha into letting him fuck her too. The werevixen would do almost <i>anything</i> with another woman, but had this hang up of only wanting her husband&#39;s cock, and William Anderson said she was that way long before they came to Moon Lake and joined were society. As a married lesbian couple, having traditional male/female sex with the Twists was probably a lost cause, but Evan still lived in hope.<br />
<br />
As Evan, his wife Maggie, and their daughter Spencer (<i>thankfully</i> Grandpa decided to stay back at their place to watch television) got out, Eric Anderson came bounding out of the house and rushed into Spencer&#39;s arms.<br />
&quot;I missed you!&quot; he announced, hugging Spencer carefully to avoid hurting her injured arm while kissing her muzzle.<br />
&quot;I certainly missed you too Slugger,&quot; said Spencer in return, running a paw through her boyfriend&#39;s brown hair while licking his face. To speed up her recovery, the natural hybrid were wolf/cat was currently the only one in her fursona, but Spencer suspected that would change when the adults got to what they <i>really</i> wanted to do, downstairs in the Anderson family basement.<br />
&quot;Listen, I need to talk to you for a moment,&quot; both practically said in unison, while Eric started dragging Spencer off to one side by her good arm.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll meet you inside. Save me some pie,&quot; requested Spencer, as she told Eric that her grandfather was spending the night with them and the couple would probably have to go back to her place to keep him company, despite the fact that she had her backpack at her feet.<br />
When Eric saw the Lawsons enter his house, closing the door behind them, he told Spencer, &quot;Nate&#39;s here with his new girlfriend, and she&#39;s a were-panthress!&quot; Then Eric proceeded to tell her all he knew about Kenya Adaeze.<br />
<br />
Spencer feigned ignorance and listened to everything Eric had to say, although she already knew some of this because Nate had already confided in her about the panthress when she confronted him about his &quot;mysterious new girlfriend&quot;.<br />
When Eric finished, Spencer said, &quot;That&#39;s very interesting. But even if we can come to an understanding with her and make the necessary... arrangements, since you&#39;ll only have one chance and any change is permanent, are you ready and willing to take the plunge into were society Eric?&quot; she asked, wondering when it would be the best time to tell her beau that while she preferred men, Spencer had enough of her mother&#39;s werecat nature to enjoy the occasional taste of female honey too.*<br />
&quot;Do you love me Spencer Lawson?&quot; he asked, taking her good hand in both of his.<br />
&quot;Yes, I do Eric,&quot; she replied without a second&#39;s hesitation, meaning every single syllable of every word.<br />
&quot;Once we&#39;ve both graduated high school, if I was to ask you an even more important question, what would your answer be?&quot;<br />
Spencer was shocked that Eric had even thought that far ahead, let alone was willing to brooch the subject now, so it honestly took her a moment to decide upon her answer. &quot;Career wise, I have absolutely no idea what I want to do beyond high school. Dad&#39;s hoping I&#39;ll follow in his paw prints and join some branch of the military, while mom&#39;s hoping I develop an interest in some branch of the medical field. I think the only way those two will be truly happy is if I become a military medic. But if your question involves the two of us spending the rest of our lives together, count me in.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then, if you think panther is the right choice, and Kenya is the right one to help us, then I&#39;m ready to become a were. For me, you, and <i>us</i>,&quot; said Eric, before they kissed again, not noticing a car pulling into the Twist family driveway next door, with Ben and his boyfriend Alex Ramsey inside.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Being the &quot;new girl&quot;, Kenya was the center of the Lawsons&#39; attention as they entered the Anderson&#39;s house. She was polite, introducing herself as everyone found out a bit about each other, but the look on Evan and Maggie&#39;s faces made her wonder if more than the usual after dinner dessert was on the menu tonight.<br />
But while Kenya Adaeze would love to sate her sexual appetite, she was more interested in seeing, let alone meeting the natural hybrid were that was Spencer Lawson.<br />
Maintaining her part of the conversation, Kenya slowly worked her way to the Anderson&#39;s living room window so she could sneak a peek outside. She couldn&#39;t hear a word Spencer and Eric were saying between the distance, the closed window, and all the background noise, but that didn&#39;t keep her from staring.<br />
<i>She is so beautiful,</i> thought Kenya, taking in the mixed beauty of the lupine and feline features. <i>And even if it&#39;s because of an injury, to be so free and open about who you TRULY are inside,</i> was the envious thought, as Kenya had to keep her own were nature suppressed until she was either in a more private place with Nate, or events at his parents house allowed her own fursona to come out and play.<br />
___________________________________________________________________<br />
*While Maggie Lawson is a were-panthress too, there is also some domestic werecat in her family tree, hence both ladies liking female honey, although Maggie&#39;s bi desires are <b>MUCH</b> stronger than her daughter&#39;s.—tmw.</p>
