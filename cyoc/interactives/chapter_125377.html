<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite everything that had happened yesterday, Brody managed to wake up after a mostly good night. Having his friends going to the dogs still weighted him, but he felt like there was nothing else to do with the phone gone, apart from fully enjoying his life.<br />
Since he might be the next one to turn.<br />
Shivering, he dismissed this thought, believing it&#39;d bring nothing but misfortune.<br />
Once he had breakfast and clothes, he immediately left for High School, while momentarily greeting his former comrades at their home.<br />
<br />
Arriving on the School field, he caught on to Maggie, tired.<br />
&quot; I still haven&#39;t managed to fetch it back &quot; did she say. &quot; I looked beforehand at the library and outside, but I kinda think it&#39;s hopeless, and I&#39;m saying that while there&#39;s still places to check... &quot;<br />
&quot; You&#39;re still looking for that phone ? &quot; asked Brody, dubious.<br />
- Yes, indeed. And I&#39;ll continue in parallel to my lessons...<br />
She seemed determinate, as if she held herself personally responsible for everything that had happened. He couldn&#39;t help himself but admire her and feel sorry for her condition. He wished he could help her overtime...<br />
He thought of it while the bell rang. Arriving in the classroom, he went to the professor, and made himself look sick.<br />
The teacher looked concerned about this, but said nothing apart from the explicit authorisation of going to the nurse&#39;s. He was keen on making sure his students would be fine, since two of them crossed the other side of the canine realm...<br />
<br />
Leaving the room, Brody immediately inclined himself to leave the grounds in direction of the library.<br />
But as soon as he started to walk, a excruciating pain rose from his bowels. He groaned while clutching his abdomen, before going to the bathroom, hoping it was nothing but one of those urgent needs.<br />
Locking himself up in a cabin, he patiently waited for relief.<br />
But nothing happened. His bowels still were still hurting like hell.<br />
And then he felt quite a itching.<br />
All over his body.<br />
He grew more and more concerned. What was happening to him was quite unclear, but something inside his mind nurtured.<br />
Even more when he raised his shirt and saw strands of black fur on his thorax.<br />
Holding a scream, he watched in pure dread the progression of his fur, reaching out for the topside and upside of his body.<br />
He remenbered the psychologic drills in class : if it happens, one must get rid of it&#39;s clothes to not get stuck inside.<br />
He threw off his shirt and shoes, unbuckled his pants, and got rid of his socks as fast as he could, before his body went completely dark, save for a few spots on his hands, feet and partially his face.<br />
Only his boxers remained, but he was caught by surprise by a newly founded stiffness coming from it&#39;s hands : they altered greatly, losing a good lenght from his fingers and his whole thumb, gaining paw pads and claws, becoming non-dexterous paws.<br />
The same happened to his feet, but his attention was craving to his former appendages.<br />
Now that he couldn&#39;t even unlock the bathroom stall, he  was somewhat trapped, unless he did not mind crawling low like a dog.<br />
He though about the irony of such a catchphrase.<br />
His arms bended the other way, stiffening to the point of becoming strong front legs. There was not much to do with them. Not even jacking off could work out.<br />
His hips altered greatly, which made him stand in a ridicule position over the toilet since the quadruped stance fitted him more realistically. His junk throbbed up, gaining a sheat that wrapped it up, and morphing to satisfy doggish desires.<br />
While the idead of mating gave him some concerns, he felt his butt melting, showing up his anus, and his tailbone getting a slight boost, stopping abruptly.<br />
Trying to see how his new «tail» formed out, Brody only managed to make himself fall, whining as he landed with force on the porcelain floor.<br />
Trying to get up proved to be of no avail. He was locked on all fours.<br />
Brody let himself lean the wall, backside, having a great oversight of his front legs, his legs whom became hind ones, and of course his newly doggy junk.<br />
His torso shifted greatly, expanding his ribcage and adjusting to his organs, which had been the first thing to ever change.<br />
From the neck down, one could easily identify a Doberman.<br />
Said neck got coarse, making Brody cought a bit. But his coughing got more and more bestial and canine, while his teeth felt painfully sharper.<br />
He tried to say something, express his feelings, anything vocally speaking. Only a doggish bark filled the room.<br />
Brody kept barking. He needed some help at this point, and there was no use hiding it anymore.<br />
But his body silenced him temporarily : his tongue felt out of his mouth, slobbering and drooling clumsily.<br />
He felt stupid at that moment, panting and staying this way without doing anything. But he couldn&#39;t help himself with that : his shift wasn&#39;t giving him more choices.<br />
The finishing touches left him with a protuded muzzle, greyish vision and perked ears.<br />
He had finally morphed into a Doberman.</p>
