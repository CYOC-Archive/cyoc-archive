<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
After Martin left, the Twists and Ryan were left alone with Claire. Part of her mind wondered why the mayor had to get back to his daughter. But most of her mind was focused on the decision she had laid before her. <br />
<br />
“Claire, I understand this must be a lot to take in. If you need to talk, I’m willing to listen.” Frances said. Both she and Samantha were still transformed. Claire studied them while Frances spoke. <br />
<br />
Samantha had silver gray tabby fur, while Frances had orange fur that was sort of like a swirl. Their bodies were pressed against the fabric of their clothes, making their changes more obvious. Specifically around their hips and breasts. <br />
<br />
“Claire?” Ryan put a hand on the girl’s shoulder. She was a bit startled, but relaxed upon seeing the concern in Ryan’s eyes. He was obviously worried about her well being. And something about him made Claire feel safe. And not just the fact that he was a police officer. <br />
<br />
“I’m okay, just thinking. Does this mean I don’t have to stay in that cell anymore?” <br />
<br />
“I suppose.” Ryan looked Samantha. She was the chancellor. It was her call. <br />
<br />
“As long as she’s with you, then it’s okay.” Samantha said. Clare and Ryan both got similar looks on their faces when Samantha said yes. The Twists couldn’t held but wonder if after the night, Claire would be were. <br />
<br />
They shifted back, and left the two alone. Frances and Samantha waited until they were outside the station to talk. <br />
<br />
“That went surprisingly well.” Samantha said. <br />
<br />
“Definitely. I didn’t think Martin would let her off that easy. With everything else that’s going on, I figured he’d just want to turn her and get it over with.” Frances said. <br />
<br />
“Ryan and Claire, when do you think that happened?” Samantha was more curious about HOW it happened. The two young adults only knew each other a day and a half. Then again, with weres, relationships moved <br />
<br />
“I don’t know. But from the looks they were giving each other, I’d say there’s a good chance Claire’s assimilation will go much smoother. She’ll still need some counseling though. I might introduce her to Jenny* if things go well. They’re the same age, and both were brought into this life against their will. Granted Jenny is perfectly happy now, but she wasn’t always.” Frances said. <br />
<br />
Samantha nodded, and asked if she needed to be at the hospital again. <br />
<br />
“Couldn’t hurt. I’d like to hear what Dr. Curry’s findings are.” Frances not only noticed anxious look on Claire’s face, but on Martin’s as well. He clearly wanted to be with his daughter at his crucial moment. And Frances wanted to see how Julie was, now that she’d been sufficiently calmed down. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
While the two Twist women went back to the hospital, Ryan took Claire around the office to gather some of her belongings. And then he offered to take her back to his apartment so she could clean herself up, and have something more than biscuits and cartons of milk. <br />
<br />
“How are you feeling?” Ryan asked as they climbed into his police cruiser. Claire shrugged. She was feelings lots of different things. And the most prevalent was a growing attraction to the handsome police officer who just stuck his neck out for her. <br />
<br />
“Alright, all things considered. It’s a lot to take in. And I’ve got about half a million questions.”<br />
<br />
“Ask away, that’s what I’m here for.” Ryan said. <br />
<br />
“Well, for starters, what’s with the K-9 unit? I’m guessing it has nothing to do with police dogs.” Claire asked. <br />
<br />
“Not exactly. Only the canine weres are registered under the K-9 unit. Though there are a few normal officers who do have dogs working with them.” <br />
<br />
“So are there a lot of… weres in the police?” Claire had to start getting used to saying that word. It was like admitting Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny was real. And Claire was really starting to wonder about that second one. <br />
<br />
“It’s a pretty even mix. Every officer has to know about weres, just makes things easier. But there’s a pretty decent normal population in town.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” <br />
<br />
“Oh sure. We have a small college here. Most out of town students are normals.” <br />
<br />
“Huh. So how exactly someone become a were? Aside from the scratching or biting.” <br />
<br />
“Well, there’s always blood transfusions. And if a normal has sex with a were…”<br />
<br />
“Sex?” Claire repeated. <br />
<br />
“Ya, sex. If fluids are exchanged then… you know…” <br />
<br />
Ryan and Claire were both blushing now. Claire got the just of what Ryan was saying. The conversation was suddenly just as uncomfortable as the sex talk she’d had with her parents when she was thirteen. <br />
<br />
Claire stared out the window to avoid Ryan’s intermittent gaze. She saw they’d arrived at a three story apartment complex with a FOR RENT sign in front of it (hint hint). Ryan escorted her up to the second floor. Claire noticed a few tenants looking at her peculiarly as she walked down the hallway with Ryan. She wondered what kind of were they might be, assuming they were weres.<br />
<br />
“Home sweet home.” Ryan said, holding the door for Claire. The apartment wasn’t anything too special, Ryan hardly spent any time there. He worked nights and late afternoons, and then used the rest of his day to sleep. Or have some recreational fun. He was glad he hadn’t had any recently, because chances were there’d still be a mess. And he didn’t think Claire was ready to know about weres and their heightened sex drives yet. <br />
<br />
“That’s a whole other bridge to cross.” Ryan thought, watching Claire take in her surroundings. He couldn’t help his eyes drifting up and down (more often down than not). He literally tried shaking the thoughts from his head, reminding himself that this wasn’t the time to be wondering how Claire was in bed. <br />
<br />
“Though if she makes the change…” he thought longingly. When Claire turned around, she noticed Ryan was standing with his legs crossed, and his face was flushed. Whatever she’d done, it had seriously turned him on.<br />
<br />
“He certainly is cute.” she thought. But after what he told me about the weres and sex thing, she knew the possibility of them having an intimate relationship was out of the picture. Unless she became a were…<br />
