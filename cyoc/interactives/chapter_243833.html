<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some time later, Lucy is sitting alone at a table in the school’s cafeteria twirling her hair, “man… I’m bored,” she grumbles, “not a single stranger randomly asking me to be friends, no boys trying to flirt with me, no open-minded girls,” the girl sighs. Just then a movement catches her attention, when looking up she sees a boy with short brown hair and light brown skin walking towards an empty table. Lucy recognizes the boy as Tim, a boy who she has a crush on for a long time, but never got the courage to start a conversation, “I got to finally get his attention before some bitch takes him,” she mumbles to herself, getting to her feet and walking towards the 13-year-old. “Hey Tim,” Lucy says as she approaches the table Tim is seated at, “how’s it going?”<br />
<br />
Tim looks up, ‘this can’t be good,’ he thinks to himself, ‘a hot chick is walking towards me! Girls never walk up to me, they all avoid me for some weird reason’.<br />
<br />
Lucy, thinking Tim didn’t hear her, repeats her sentence, “hey Tim… how’s it going?”<br />
<br />
“Um… s-sorry… do I know you,” Tim finally says.<br />
<br />
“I… my name is Lucy,” Lucy says, “I… we passed us a few times in the halls”.<br />
<br />
“And how do you know my name,” Tim asks, tilting his head.<br />
<br />
“I… um… I’ve overheard you talking with a friend of yours and he called you “Tim”, that’s… that’s how I know”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Tim says, “and… what do you want from me? Have… have I done something?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean,” Lucy asks, tilting her head.<br />
<br />
“Well… I mean…,” Tim takes a deep breath, “girls… especially hot ones like yourself… usually avoid me”.<br />
<br />
“Oh… no, don’t worry,” Lucy says, “you haven’t done anything”.<br />
<br />
“Then why are you talking to me,” Tim asks.<br />
<br />
“Well… to be honest,” Lucy says, “I… I have a crush on you… but… but I was to afraid to approach you, fearing you might… well…”.<br />
<br />
Tim’s eyes widen, “y-you have a crush on me,” he asks in surprise, “how… how long?”<br />
<br />
“Um… six months,” Lucy says.<br />
<br />
Tim’s eyes widen even more, “that long? Why approach me now?”<br />
<br />
“Be-because… because I’m tired of being afraid… and I don’t want another girl getting you,” Lucy says, “but… I can tell that you have no interest in me… well, at least I tried, sorry for bothering you,” the girl then turns and walks away, leaving a stunned Tim behind.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the 13-year-old, who Lucy had transformed into a girl that morning, is walking along a corridor, ‘I can’t find her anywhere, does that mean I’m stuck like this,’ the former boy, who’s name is Mason, thinks to himself, ‘I hope I’ll find her soon and that she changes me back. Or will, whatever spell she put on me, revert itself? That’s… that’s how stuff like this works, right? I mean… I am the school’s best basketball player, I can’t be a girl, I don’t WANT to be a girl, I want MY life back!’<br />
<br />
“Hey Madison,” a female voice suddenly calls out, looking up she sees a 12-year-old girl running up to her, “what’s keeping you? Practice will start any minute! Come on,” the girl, who Mason doesn’t recognize, grabs the former boy’s arm and starts pulling him along.<br />
<br />
Mason doesn’t notice Lucy walking past him as he is tugged along the corridor, “prac-practise? B-but… I’m not a cheer…”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t be so modest,” the other girl interrupts, “have you forgotten that you have passed the addition with flying collars, Madison?”<br />
<br />
“B-but my name is not Ma…,” Mason tries saying.<br />
<br />
The other girl, however, cuts him off a second time, “come ON,” Mason lets out a sigh as he continues to get drag down the corridors and towards the exit of the building.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, a girl with long red hair, who looks exactly like how Mason is looking now, is looking up at her dad, tears in her eyes, “wh-what do you mean, daddy: we’re moving to Alska,” the girl asks, “we can’t move! I just made the squad at my school!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, princess,” her dad says, “I got a new job which pays three times more than my previous job. I am not letting this pass, just because you managed to get a slot as a cheerleader at your school, Madison! We are moving, and that’s final!”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mason has been dragged all the way to the football field where the practice is supposed to be held. The former boy, now dressed in a cheerleading uniform, is currently running laps with the blue-haired girl, having decided to just give up trying to tell the girl that he is not who she thinks he is.<br />
<br />
“By the way,” the blue-haired girl suddenly says, “I love how you dyed your hair”.<br />
<br />
“Hu? What do you mean,” Mason asks, “this is my natural color”.<br />
<br />
“Oh? Natural blond,” the girl asks, “wow, maybe that explains why you are acting so weird today”.<br />
<br />
Mason blinks in confusion before letting out a sigh, “look, I really don’t think I know how to be a cheerl…,” he is interrupted as a whistle is heard.<br />
<br />
“ATTENTION,” a female voice then booms.<br />
<br />
‘Aww… crap,’ Mason thinks to himself, turning towards the sound of the voice.<br />
<br />
“Begin training, you know what to do,” the woman, Mrs. Johnson, booms.<br />
<br />
To Mason’s surprise, as soon as the teacher blows her whistle, he finds himself instinctively grab some poms and start doing jumps, splits, somersaults, and other cheerleading exercises.<br />
<br />
Finally, after two hours, the teacher blows the whistle, “alright, that’ll do for today, good job girls! Keep it up, and you’ll go far,” she says, “now, head to the showers and get changed, then head to your next classes!”<br />
<br />
“Yes ma’am,” the girls, including Mason, say before heading towards the showers.<br />
<br />
Mason gulps hard and blushes as he enters the girl’s changing room and showers, ‘I shouldn’t be here,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but… I’m currently a girl, so… I guess I’m allowed to be here’. The former boy finds a quiet spot and starts to strip out of the sweaty uniform, ‘man, that was so exhausting,’ he thinks to himself, ‘my legs feel like lead! But most importantly: how on earth did I know what to do? It… it felt like I’ve been doing cheerleading all my life!’<br />
<br />
The former boy lets out a sigh as he steps into the showers, staring down at his body, at HIS B32 breasts and HIS pussy, ‘I miss my dick,’ he thinks to himself, ‘and these… things on my chest… how the hell can girls live with these?! And I thought having a cock was annoying!’<br />
<br />
Mason steps out of the shower a few minutes later, he grabs a towel and dries himself off, biting his lower lip as he accidentally lets out a soft moan, luckily there is no one nearby, ‘fuck… a girl’s body is so fucking sensitive,’ he thinks to himself, ‘no wonder they ALWAYS moan when being touched lightly!’<br />
<br />
Mason wraps a towel around his head and one around his body, ‘and WHY do I know how to wrap myself in towels,’ he asks himself, ‘what has that… girl done to me?’<br />
<br />
The former boy walks over to where he had left his school uniform, he grabs the bra and, without difficulty, fastens it behind his back, ‘I hope I’ll change back soon… this shit is freaking me out,’ he thinks to himself as he pulls up the panties.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” a familiar voice suddenly says, when Mason looks up he sees the blue-haired girl, wearing only a bra and panties, walking up to him, “I can’t stop wondering why you are acting so weird today, Madison”.<br />
<br />
Mason sighs, deciding, instead of trying to tell this girl who he really is, just to go along with it, hoping that tomorrow, everything will be back to normal. “Sorry, it… it’s just been a weird day,” he says, “maybe I got some sort of sunstroke”.<br />
<br />
“Would make sense, you are completely out of it today,” the girl says, “maybe you should go and see a doctor?”<br />
<br />
“Nah… I’ll be fine,” Mason says, “school’s almost over anyway, I’ll just head home straight away”. The former boy then thinks, ‘how am I gonna explain THIS to my parents?!’<br />
<br />
“Alright, if you are sure,” the girl says, “my name is Natsumi Sato, by the way!”<br />
<br />
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Natsumi,” Mason says.<br />
<br />
Natsumi smiles, “same, let’s head to the sinks, we need to hurry and finish up,” she says.<br />
<br />
Mason nods, following Natsumi to the sinks, when he sees himself for the first time in the mirror, the former boy lets out a gasp, ‘w-wow… I… I’m actually super hot,’ he thinks to himself, luckily Natsumi doesn’t seem to have noticed the gasp, ‘god… please don’t let a boy start flirting with me! I am NOT gay!’</p>
