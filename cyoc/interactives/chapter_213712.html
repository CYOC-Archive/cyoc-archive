<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather woke several hours later, refreshed and ready to experiment with her newfound knowledge of her diapers. She carefully checked her door and found that it was still locked, though she gave the knob a solid twist to be sure. Then she looked down at her diaper. It was still dry and it seemed a waste to throw it away unused. With a frown, Heather focused on her bladder, willing it to release. Just like when she tried her brother&#39;s diapers the day before she found it surprisingly easy to just let go. Unlike her brother&#39;s diapers these ones readily took all that she had to give, swelling up quite a bit but nowhere near as much as the other ones she had worn yesterday. Satisfied that she had gotten her full use out of this diaper she pulled the tapes and let it fall to the floor. It landed with a sodden thud and Heather just left it and walked over to her desk.<br />
<br />
She had been thinking last night about totems and agreed with the website that a bracelet was best. Apparently it would stay on her wrist no matter what she did so it would always be ready for her to make a quick escape if needed. She dug around in a drawer until she found one of those charity wristbands that had been popular a while back. She pulled it onto her wrist walked back to the bed. She picked up her phone and confirmed in the app which scenario she was going to try this time. She had liked the Best of Both Worlds, even if it had its drawbacks, and had chosen a similar one called Padded Paradise. Unlike BoBW which had two distinct modes that you could switch between, Padded Paradise blended both together with some extras. For the most part she would be treated her normal age, but she would be diapered and dressed as a baby. She would be mostly independent, but would have to rely on others to feed and change her. She had turned incontinence off, preferring to know when she needed to pee and making a conscious choice rather than just letting it happen. Finally, she had debated about whether or not to turn off sexual scenarios but in the end she decided to leave it be. She would be in control this time.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of other settings like diaper thickness, non-user awareness of her state, history in the scenario. It was a lot to go through and Heather was slightly worried that she may have misunderstood the meaning of a toggle or set a slider too high. In the end she decided that she was just wasting time and set the app to ready. She set her phone down on her desk and grabbed a fresh diaper from the box.<br />
<br />
She realized as she was laying it out that she had forgotten to clean herself off after removing the previous diaper, but the only wipes in the house were in her brother&#39;s room and she couldn&#39;t risk going to borrow some. Deciding that it would be a non-issue once she had triggered the scenario she chose to just ignore it and deal with it later. She sat down carefully on the new diaper and the tingling feeling was in full force. This time however it seemed to be focusing on her wristband. Heather took it as a sign that it was accepted as her totem. The app had told her that the changes to Padded Paradise she had made had been accepted and to focus on the scenario name to start it so she did so now as she applied the last tape. She closed her eyes as the room began spinning again. Since she had experienced it before she knew what to expect and simply lay back and let it happen. When the world stopped spinning she opened her eyes and confirmed her new surroundings.<br />
<br />
Her bedroom had reverted to the setup from BoBW, except her desk had just gotten smaller instead of transforming into a toybox. She hopped off the bed, noting that the diaper had thickened but not so much that she couldn&#39;t walk, and began checking drawers. Her dresser contained much the same type of clothing it had the last time, though she noted that there was an almost complete lack of more teen-oriented clothing. Though smaller, her desk contained everything it should without a single sign of the adult toys that had been in the box previously. She did find her small dildo, tucked away in its usual hiding spot, but it was completely unchanged. She picked up her phone and checked the app. It had a grey overlay with the words &#39;Scenario in Progress&#39; in bold red letters. No editing a scenario while it was running, just like the app said. She closed it out and checked her social media, getting quite a shock.<br />
<br />
Her Instagram page was still there, but the photos now showed her dressed in diapers and onesies. She flipped through her photos and found some from the trip to the beach earlier that summer. There were all of her friends, plus a few parents that had come along to chaperone, exactly as they should be. She saw Mel in that racerback onepiece that had looked so odd on her tall frame. She also saw many pics of herself in what was clearly a swim diaper... and nothing else. Blushing, she flipped through furiously, trying to find any picture that didn&#39;t show off her rather small chest. She finally found one from the morning when they were loading the cars. She was wearing a rather short sundress that didn&#39;t quite cover the thick diaper that peeked out from under it. A few photos later she was lying on a towel in the sand while Mel removed her sodden padding. You could see everything. Blushing even harder she found one of her in a fresh swim diaper getting sunblock rubbed onto her chest by Mel. She zoomed in. Her nipples were definitely erect. Mortified, she checked the settings and was relieved to find that her account was set to private and that only her friends could see it. Apprehensively she checked the comments but found them to be just the same as she would always get, though baby themed emojis were sprinkled liberally throughout instead of the usual ones.<br />
<br />
Deciding that Insta was a minefield she flipped over to FB instead. There was surprisingly little change there. Her profile pic had pigtails and a pacifier and the header was now of her in a playpen with her brother instead of holding him. Her posts were mostly unchanged except the memes had many more baby things in them. The pictures were just like the ones on Insta so Heather tried to avoid them but she got caught up by a tagged post from her own mother titled &#39;Baby&#39;s 15th B-day!&#39; She remembered her birthday. She definitely hadn&#39;t worn that party dress that was cut to show off a thick diaper, but here were the pictures. She flipped through until she found one of herself sitting in a highchair, in just a diaper, with cake smeared on her face and hands.<br />
<br />
Heather locked her phone and placed it back on her desk. This was a little too much. She briefly considered using her totem to escape this, but that nagging little voice in the back of her head came back. It was alright, none of this was actually real. She could enjoy this strange world for as long as she liked and then go back with no consequences. All those photos would simply cease to exist. All evidence erased. She took a deep breath and picked her phone up. She went back and looked through all the pictures again. These were nothing. They were nothing this morning and they would be nothing again later. She let the breath out.<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s kind of a pity though,&#39; thought that unrepentant part of her mind, &#39;Some of those pictures are kind of cute.&#39;<br />
<br />
She had to agree, and found herself reflexively hitting save on quite a number of them.<br />
<br />
Putting her phone down again she walked over to her dresser and pulled a drawer open to find a shirt. Her mind blanked as she stared at the clothing neatly folded within. Then she remembered the setting she had chosen. She didn&#39;t dress herself. It looked like the app interpreted that as she *couldn&#39;t* dress herself. She shrugged and considered her options. She could call for her mother, or even her sister, to help her. She could just wait until someone came to get her. Or, and Heather blushed all over again at this thought, she could just leave the room as she was. The pictures proved that &#39;being dressed as a baby&#39; included all baby outfits. Even just a diaper and nothing else. Feeling suddenly daring, she made up her mind and opened her bedroom door.<br />
<br />
The house was quiet as she crept along the hallway. It was still early on a summer morning so most of her family probably wouldn&#39;t be awake. She walked past her sister&#39;s open door and peeked in. Hillary was fast asleep on her bed, dressed in her usual summer sleep attire of tanktop and boyshorts. She sprawled on top of the covers, snoring lightly but loud enough for Heather to hear it. Heather chuckled and moved on, down the stairs and into the kitchen. There she found her mother, always an early riser, fully dressed for the day and making coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning babygirl.&quot; She said quietly, not batting an eye at her daughter&#39;s state of undress. &quot;You&#39;re up early today. Want me to get you some breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather nodded, not trusting her voice at the moment. Her mother indicated the highchair, which sat open and waiting for her. She clambered into the seat and was buckled in, the tray swung into place and locked with a click. Mandy puttered around for a bit before placing a bowl of warm oatmeal onto the tray. Heather didn&#39;t wait for a spoon, she knew one wasn&#39;t coming. She plunged her bare fingers into the warm goop and began scooping it into her mouth. Mandy finished making her coffee and sat at the table across from her daughter to drink it. Heather suddenly felt self-conscious with her mother watching her. She hunched down into the seat a bit. Mandy didn&#39;t seem to notice her discomfort, she just sipped her coffee and watched Heather dribble oatmeal down her chest.<br />
<br />
When she was about halfway through the bowl she heard the unmistakable thumping of her sister coming down the stairs. Hillary bounced into the kitchen, ignoring both her mother and sister. She hadn&#39;t bothered getting dressed before coming down. Her mother gave her a side-eyed look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t have been bothered to at least put a pair of shorts on I see.&quot; she said sardonically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh.&quot; Hillary replied as she poured cereal into a bowl. &quot;Why bother, it&#39;s not like we have any guests over. Besides, Heather is often in her underwear and no one complains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not the same and you know it.&quot; Mandy sighed. &quot;Maybe I should just put you into diapers as well, you could match your siblings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hillary made a face at her mother&#39;s comment and began shoveling her breakfast into her mouth at lightning speed. She was moving so fast that milk and bits of cereal were being splashed from her bowl and falling from the spoon onto her shirt. Heather watched her sister curiously. She had never been this sloppy before. Were the diapers doing this? Mandy was also watching her youngest daughter and commented again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps a bib then, so I don&#39;t have to wash so many of your shirts every day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hillary looked up at her mother, then dropped her spoon into the bowl, pulled her shirt off, and tossed it into a corner. Both Mandy and Heather stared as she went right back to eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;What on earth has gotten into you today?&quot; Mandy asked, exasperated. &quot;Do you feel like you&#39;re not getting enough attention or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hillary didn&#39;t answer. She finished her breakfast and dropped her dishes into the sink as she left the kitchen. Her shirt remained where it had landed. Heather and Mandy both stared after her, then at eachother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to deal with her later.&quot; Mandy sighed. She looked up at the clock. &quot;Mel should be here any moment. Finish your oatmeal while you wait. I&#39;ll be upstairs getting Derek ready for the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy strode out of the kitchen, leaving Heather to finish her oatmeal. She had just scooped the last of it into her mouth when...</p>
