<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy send a message to Mark, asking if they could hang out over at his. She also came up with a bullshit excuse as to why she wasn&#39;t at school currently. She wasn&#39;t sure if he believed it, but he was more than happy to have her over. With that hurdle out of the way, it was time to wait.<br />
<br />
Once school was almost over for Mark, Amy picked up her sack filled with stuff, and left her house. She did her best to avoid encountering anyone due to her looks, and seemed to successfully get all the way over to Mark&#39;s without being noticed. Then she waited, just out of sight, until she could hear someone come home. &quot;Please be him, please be him.&quot; Amy begged as she peeked around the corner. It was him. She picked up the stuff she brought along and went out to greet him. &quot;Hey Mark.&quot; She waved at him.<br />
&quot;Hi Amyyyyy whaaat are you wearing?&quot; he asked in confusion, his eyes drawn to the little pink slit between Amy&#39;s legs.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kind of a long story. Can we get inside first, though?&quot; she asked him.<br />
&quot;Sure... and that stuff?&quot; he gestured to the sack as he pulled out his keys.<br />
&quot;Part of that story.&quot; Amy replied coldly.<br />
<br />
Once inside Mark&#39;s room, Amy told him about yesterday and what those socks have made her, together with what she knows about her situation. Mark sat there with the looks of someone who is seeing their friend having completely lost it.<br />
&quot;So you want me to believe that you are not wearing a latex suit, but that the latex is part of your skin? You do know how it sounds, right?&quot; he said after Amy was done.<br />
&quot;Of course not. I am going to show you that I am not bullshitting you.&quot; replied Amy as she rummaged through the sack and pulled out a pair of sports wrist bands and put them on right up to her latex clad hands. With a familiar tingle followed by a burning sensation, her wristbands became more black latex attached to her skin. Mark dropped his jaw. &quot;See? So, wanna have some fun with this?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
&quot;So have fun with having you turning into latex? What can I do to help?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
&quot;I would love some input from you. If I am going to be a latex person, I want to be a sexy latex person.&quot; came from Amy.<br />
&quot;So like, helping you determining your breast size?&quot; ask Mark with Amy replying with a purr and a nod. &quot;Your hair?&quot;<br />
&quot;If you want.&quot; said Amy. &quot;If you think that I would look sexy without ears, then we&#39;ll get rid of them.&quot; she followed.<br />
Then Mark chuckled to himself. &quot;So if I want to make you a sex doll?&quot;<br />
Amy replied with a smile. She hoped that his perverted side would show up. &quot;Mark, if you could find a way to make me into your own personal fleshlight, then a fleshlight I would gladly be.&quot; Amy said with her most seductive voice.<br />
&quot;Well then.&quot; Mark said, as he was completely on board with Amy&#39;s plan. &quot;How should we go about this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Where ever you want, Mark. Though, let us leave my mouth for last. When that is turned, I will be mute.&quot; Amy replied.<br />
&quot;Alright. So, I think that we should make you a sex doll.&quot; Mark stated.<br />
&quot;Sounds great. But how about we start by enhancing my human looks, and then dollify me?&quot; Amy suggested.<br />
&quot;Fine by me.&quot; And so they began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, do you have something to slim your waist?&quot; Mark asked. Amy rummaged through her sack and pulled out a corset she had. &quot;So, how are you with breathing right now?&quot; <br />
Amy looked at him puzzled. &quot;How can I say this? As if all of it just goes to my head... And my arms, I guess. I don&#39;t have blood anywhere else. Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because I think we could change your body to be a more accurate fit for&quot; and he made a certain gesture. &quot;hourglass.&quot;<br />
Amy giggled. &quot;I think I can fix part of our current predicament then.&quot; She rummaged through her stuff and pulled out a moisturizer. &quot;This should take care of those fleshy arms.&quot; She opened the bottle, sprayed the contents on her hands and rubbed them up her arms, covering them the entire length. She could feel a tingle from shoulder to fingertip, and then the burning sensation on her arms. When it was over, both her arms were completely latex, but they were shinier than the rest of her body. That gave Amy an idea. &quot;So, you want me more shiny?&quot; she asked.<br />
Mark caught on. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be better to wait, until we have finalized your form?&quot; he asked her.<br />
&quot;I have three extra bottles in there, so there will be plenty.&quot; Amy replied with a smug smile. &quot;So help covering my back side.&quot; She held the bottle forward.<br />
The two started rubbing the cream on her body, Mark taking her backside, though avoiding the inner parts of her ass and went down to her legs. Amy was a bit disappointed that he avoided the area, with what their plan currently was, but she also kind of understood, and did the last parts of her ass, herself. When she went over her little pussy slip though, it got more defined, and she noticed that she now had what could be mistaken for some pussy lips. As they had rubbed her body the tingling began as they moved on to other parts increasing her shine. Amy took a lookover and loved her shiny new look. Both of them had also noticed she had gotten more squeaky. Amy loved it as she moved her hands around her body, making a squeak where she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where next?&quot; Amy asked her companion.<br />
&quot;Well, how about that hourglass. First the waist, then your breasts and finishing off with your hips and ass?&quot; suggested Mark, and Amy agreed on the action.<br />
Amy put on the corset, and Mark started to tighten it. The corset rubbed against Amy as it tightened, making her squeak with each pull Mark did. When it had been reduced to a degree Mark was satisfied with, he asked Amy if she was fine. She was, so they locked the corset in place, and it fused with her.<br />
&quot;Uuuuh.&quot; Amy said as she rubbed her hands around her tiny waist. &quot;I love the feel of these impossible body standards for women.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, let us add to that.&quot; Mark replied as he found a giant bra inside Amy&#39;s belongings. &quot;So, any history about this monster?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom used it for some kind of costume to a company party last year. I was surprised that she still had it.&quot; Amy said.<br />
&quot;So, should we use it, or be a bit more modest?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
&quot;Screw modesty.&quot; Amy replied together with a wide arm movement. &quot;Let us go all the way. Tits the size of basketballs is all this latex girl wants.&quot; She was having fun, and she could see that Mark also was. For once, playing dress-up have been a fun experience for a guy, she thought.<br />
&quot;So, how do we make sure that your breasts will get to the right size? Stuff the bra?&quot; asked Mark, with Amy answering that it was probably the answer. She pulled out shirts and socks and filled it up. She had prepared for the idea of filling, so there was more than enough. She then put on the bra and it didn&#39;t take long for the feeling of fusing began. Once it was over, her tits were gigantic, and also in defiance with gravity. Amy loved it, and Mark found it sexy. They also took note that she was still as shiny as she was before.<br />
<br />
Next Amy took out some oversized yoga pants. They stuffed the upper legs and ass part of the pants with more shirts and used rubber bands to have the lower parts of the pants hug her legs as tightly as they could. Then with a clever use of a g-string, the yoga pants formed perfectly on her ass. As they left it alone for a moment, the pants started to fuse with her, her hips getting wide, her thighs gaining mass, and her ass rounded out everything perfectly. Amy looked at herself. &quot;Mmmhhhh, I look thicc and ready to fuck.&quot; she said as she took note of her pussy which now looked like a tight normal looking pussy, if pussies were made of latex. &quot;Quite litterally.&quot; she added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; Amy asked as she was quite satisfied with how she looked, her face not counting.<br />
&quot;Well, how about we put you in some heels?&quot; Mark asked as he pulled out some high-heel shoes.<br />
&quot;If you want to. We are making me YOUR kind of sexy, so if you think I need heels, then I need heels.&quot; replied Amy.<br />
&quot;Well, I was thinking about where not only did you have some high heels as your feet, but that the foot part have you on the tip of you toes.&quot; said Mark, as he took out a pair which had the smallest of toe insertion at the end, which could be possible.<br />
&quot;You do know that my feet will take the complete shape of those shoes even if they are too big.&quot; Amy reminded him.<br />
&quot;Are they too big?&quot; asked Mark. She nodded. &quot;Then I have a fix for that.&quot;<br />
He left the room and returned some minutes later with a saw and some duct tape. Amy just stared as Mark sawed the toes off and covered the holes with the tape. With his handy-work done, it would really be like walking on the very tip of ones toes in those shoes. &quot;Wanna try them on?&quot; Mark handed her the shoes, she sat down and put them on with ease. <br />
She could feel the shoes fusing together with her feet and when they were done her feet was feeling weird. She took a look at them and could see how it looked like her feet split in two, into a curved heel in the front, and a straight heel in the back. She placed her feet on the floor, feeling the surface with each of the four points. It was strange, but it felt good. She got up and started walking, slowly. For every step she took, her ass swayed from one side to the other, her body squeaking as she moved. She realized that with these feet she was forced to walk in a sexy manner. Something that hadn&#39;t gone unnoticed by Mark.<br />
&quot;So you think I walk seductively?&quot; she asked him in her &#39;sexy&#39; voice as she started circling around him, exaggerating her hip sway. Mark could do nothing but nod. &quot;So you like how sexy I am moving?&quot; Once again, Mark just nodded. She stopped in front of him, leaned into his ear and whispered as seductively as she could &quot;So do I.&quot; She looked down and noticed how tight Marks pants were. She giggled to herself.<br />
&quot;Anything more on my body you want me to change?&quot; Amy returned to her normal voice. Mark shook his head. &quot;Then let us start transforming my head.</p>
