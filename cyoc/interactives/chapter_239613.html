<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Austin is an anthro GSD slave in the community center.”  <br />
<br />
Fuck it.<br />
<br />
Steve selected the space between “GSD” and “slave”, adding the word “breeding” between them.<br />
<br />
Looking up, Steve had expected that, as with the previous change he’d made, Austin would more or less stay the same.  Instead, Steve watched as a look of shock and bewilderment came across Austin’s face, followed by the anthro dog clutching at his stomach.<br />
<br />
The fur on Austin’s belly was pressed outwards by the ballooning flesh underneath it, pressing out into the soon to be bitch’s hands until they went from being pressed flat against Austin’s belly to cupping what looked like a fur covered basketball hanging of the front of his body.<br />
<br />
Steve watched as the bitchifying German Shepard began panting.  Still cupping his now gravid belly with one hand, Austin began leaning over as he used his other hand to balance against the center’s plate glass wall.  Austin’s change in stance resulted in a flurry of motion from the bitch’s chest, drawing Steve’s eyes to the two massive breasts that, unrestrained by a bra, were now swaying underneath him.<br />
<br />
From their position behind the newly forged bitch, the other players all seemed to be unaware of the changes that had been forced on to their friend’s body.  Austin, however, seemed well aware of what had happened as he looked up and seemed to stare straight into Steve’s eyes.<br />
<br />
No, Steve knew, that wasn’t what Austin was doing.  The inside of the glass was acting as a mirror and Austin was just looking into her own eyes.  Still, what Steve saw in the pregnant bitch’s eyes was the same thing he’d seen in his own eyes earlier today – it was a look that spoke of both its owner’s knowledge of the situation as well as their inability to accept it.<br />
<br />
Any doubt that Steve might have had as to whether Austin was finished changing into a full bitch vanished the instant that Steve saw a large gush of water explode out from underneath her.  Austin’s water had broken, marking the transition from Austin’s transition from a gravid bitch to a bitch in labor.<br />
<br />
The anthro cried out as her face contorted and her mouth opened wide.  The hand that had been pressed into the glass flew back to her belly as Austin began staggering backwards.  The other players began backing up as well, both due to their confusion as to what had just transpired as well as their desire to give some space to the unfamiliar anthro in front of them.<br />
<br />
Steve saw the bitch take one faltering step backwards, then another, all while her body visibly contorted by the contraction that was wracking through it.  Austin continued staggering backwards as her chest was pulled further and further forward until she ultimately lost her balance, falling onto her backside.<br />
<br />
Now sitting on her butt, the bitch’s legs flew open, only for her to tuck her feet up against the back of her thighs.  Now sitting spread legged with her knees in the air, Austin wrapped her arms around her legs.  Eyes closed and screaming in agony, she hugged down and brought her torso up until her belly was pressed firmly into the tops of her thighs.  The bitch had brought herself into a position that Steve had seen on the internet many times before – while it wasn’t a stance that a person would normally take, it was perfect for someone who was bearing down as they tried to give birth.<br />
<br />
A few of the other players rushed over to Austin, with one sitting down behind her, holding her shoulders while supporting her partially lifted torso.  The other players stayed to the side of her, leaving Steve with an unobstructed view of the bitch’s vagina.  <br />
<br />
Steve’s instincts told him that, much like the situation that Steve had found himself in earlier, Austin was in a for a long, painful birth.  However, those instincts were dispelled when Steve saw the lips of Austin’s vagina begin to part as a round, brown furred object began pushing out from between them.  Another spasm wracked the bitch’s body and two small ears unfolded from the top of the crowning head between Austin’s legs.<br />
<br />
“Ding”<br />
<br />
The noise brought Steve’s attention to the phone, and he saw the sentence that was currently selected: <br />
<br />
“Austin is an anthro GSD breeding slave in the community center.”  <br />
<br />
Steve sighed.  He’d kind of assumed that Austin would remain a male breeding slave after the changes, but that wasn’t to be.  At least she was already crowning, which meant that her labor would be over in a few minutes.  Curious as to what the app would give for Austin’s current situation, Steve hit the generate new sentence button:<br />
<br />
“The laboring bitch is in agony as the baby’s shoulders pass through her pelvis.”<br />
<br />
*won’t pass*<br />
<br />
What?  Steve felt the miasma explode out of the phone as the car itself seemed to come alive with a black, festering mass.<br />
<br />
*won’t pass*<br />
<br />
I…<br />
<br />
*WON’T PASS*<br />
<br />
The world grew dark as Steve tried to ignore the voice.  His finger moved across the screen as he kept pressing down, trying to hit the regenerate button, but everything was so dark and cold…<br />
<br />
The darkness receded and Steve saw the changes he had made: “pass through” had been changed to “won’t pass” – and Steve’s finger was headed straight for the submit button.<br />
<br />
No!  Steve tried calling out to his body, but the command had already been given.  It didn’t matter how much Steve wanted to stop it, his finger was inching closer to the submit button and the command from his brain wasn’t going to arrive in time!  Steve’s finger pressed into the touchscreen, then immediately pulled back.  <br />
<br />
The sentence on the screen reformed into: “The laboring bitch is in agony as the baby’s shoulders won’t pass her pelvis.”<br />
<br />
Steve looked back up to see Austin’s balled hands banging against the floor as the head crowning between her thighs continued to try to push through a set of feminine lips that had already stretched as far as they could.  Still, although Steve didn’t understand what had just happened, he knew that the app had now made it so that Austin’s tight pussy was far from her biggest problem at the moment.<br />
<br />
So, what had happened?  Was the blackness that had enveloped Steve really some sort of malicious cloud emanated by the app to force Steve to do its bidding?  Or had Steve actually made those changes and his mind had just blacked out on him to keep him from admitting that it was actually him forcing this fate onto a person he’d never met before?<br />
<br />
By now the other players in the community center had divided themselves into two groups.  The first group was huddled around Austin and seemed to be making a confused, albeit good faith effort to do what they could, completely unaware that the app had made it so that no matter what they did, that baby wasn’t going to be able to fit through Austin’s pelvis.<br />
<br />
The other group was mulling towards the back of the room.  A few of them had taken their phones out, only to realize that they had no service.  Another seemed to be searching a row of cabinets in a panic – no doubt looking for the key to the door so that they could get out of there.  The remainder were just kind of standing there in a daze, clearly overwhelmed by the sight of one of their fellow players suddenly turning into a pregnant anthro dog who was in the final stages of labor.<br />
<br />
Steve didn’t know what to do.  Should he keep going?  Did the app even want him to?  Or was what it had done to Austin enough?  She wouldn’t die, Steve thought, since someone would eventually find the key and take her to a hospital.  Then it wouldn’t matter if she couldn’t have a vaginal birth as they would just do a c-section and she’d be fine.  <br />
<br />
Or… no, Steve knew that, just like the police officer turned pregnant vixen, Austin would never be fine.  But she’d be… well… there were plenty of female furries on the internet.  Maybe Austin was one of them?</p>
