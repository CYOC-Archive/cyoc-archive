<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN) This chapter contains some vulgar language, but their is no warning button for it. So I'm putting that warning here.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I getting a bad feeling about this...&quot; Dave said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because you know it isn't right,&quot; I told him...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the local teachers does need a new aide,&quot; Meredeth said slowly, and looking very embarrassed, &quot;but the school won't be settling that issue until closer to start of the next school year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meredeth,&quot; Frank Rhoer said firmly, &quot;You were supposed to be honest with her. She is family... what she does should be her choice. Not coerced out of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, she's just said that she isn't a rancher,&quot; Meredeth answered, &quot;if I told her the truth, she wouldn't have come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would someone please explain to me what is going on?&quot; Molly spoke, the agitation and confusion evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Beauregard saw the news report as well as we did...&quot; Meredeth began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think everyone in America saw some report about about that freak show,&quot; Molly answered, getting up to her full height, &quot;Why have I been CALLED HERE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearly everyone backed away at the near roar that Molly gave. She now knew she had been lied to by her own family, and she wasn't happy with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW DID THIS BEAUREGARD KNOW WHO I AM?&quot; Molly roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be my fault,&quot; Frank Rhoer spoke slowly, &quot;I know your parents and I never saw each other as much you would have liked, but I did like to hear about what you were up to. You are family Molly. I liked to tell him about my family and that includes you and your parents. So, then when the news report came out that you were mutated, he approached me about wanting to hire you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; Molly advanced on him, making her Uncle back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't really know,&quot; Frank Rhoer said nervously, &quot;He simply told me that he wanted to hire you, and asked me to call you to come out. I then got busy bailing one of the early hay crops and asked Meredeth took make the call. I had thought that she would have told you the truth. I'm sorry that you hadn't found out about it this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly then stopped and glared toward her cousins.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why did you engineer the story that the school was looking for a teacher's assistant?&quot; Molly questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nessie and I didn't know why Mr. Beauregard wants to hire you either, but we assumed it had to be something related to his ranch,&quot; Meredeth answered, &quot;and from what dad has learned from your folks, we knew you were interested in teaching or something like that, so we used it as cover. He does pay well, for &quot;ranch labor&quot; and figured it was a good idea... and even if it isn't, one of the teachers does require a teacher's aide. If you have a resume you could drop it off with the teacher anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly then turned to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should I do, George?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not really my place to say,&quot; I answered, &quot;to be honest, if I were in your shoes, I'd repack and go home now. The position can't be good if the recruiter feels it necessary to lie to get you out here... but then that is me. But they are your family, and your Uncle doesn't seem that bad, and there might actually be an opening at the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think I should stay?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe to hear what this Beauregard has to say while waiting to drop off a resume and your address with the school,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
Molly slowly nodded, &quot;I guess I can meet your boss, but George is to be present, and I reserve the right to tell him to buzz off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Frank Rhoer said slowly.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So you went along with it?&quot; Dave asked, sounding surprised, &quot;but they lied to her... to you... it's not right!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly and I both agree with you, but we had already come out this far,&quot; I told him, &quot;and I think Molly was looking for something that would give her reason to trust someone besides me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But to lie that way!&quot; Dave protested, &quot;and to call me nuts besides!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing in life is easy, and the freak show only insured that fact for Molly,&quot; I sighed, &quot;we couldn't just only agree to take the easy path. I know this sounds like I'm repeating what my mother had said... but in some sense both of us were right. Molly needs the open spaces that a place like Columbia Falls can provide for her... but there are problems that we simply HAVE to face and can not run away from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It still doesn't sound right to me,&quot; Dave spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we wouldn't really know HOW wrong it was until we met Mr. Beauregard the next day,&quot; I responded...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next day began early with Frank Rhoer practically yodeling into the guest bedroom that Molly and I shared. I was awakened easily, but Molly only rolled over, and with her arm around me, I was pulled along for the ride. It made me feel like I was a giant teddy bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Molly,&quot; I said, gently brushing her cheek fur with my fingers, &quot;it's time to get up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's still night out,&quot; Molly protested, opening her eyes slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ranchers apparently start early,&quot; I told her, &quot;come on. We stayed to hear what this Beauregard has to say, best not to keep him waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly yawned, showing me her large canines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she sighed and released me and sat up, &quot;I'm up; I'm up.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up to watch her pull on a clean dress and then turn to me as I sat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we doing the right thing, hearing this guy out?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
I pulled on a pair of pants and a shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't really know for sure,&quot; I admitted.<br />
<br />
Breakfast was a fairly silent affair that morning. Both Meredeth and Nessie knew that Molly didn't like being lied to, and I think they were quiet so not to anger her more. Frank Rhoer had made an impressive stack of pancakes, which everyone but Molly ate. Her Uncle then watched in surprise as Molly found what steak was leftover from the night before and finished all of the eggs that were in the refrigerator... raw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tigers are carnivores and need about ten pounds of meat per day to sustain their metabolism,&quot; I explained as Frank Rhoer watched in surprise.<br />
<br />
No one said anything until all the plates were clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Molly, George, we'd best get going,&quot; Frank Rhoer spoke, &quot;Mr. Beauregard will be waiting for us before he begins his day.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
About fifteen minutes later Frank Rhoer pulled his truck into the &quot;driveway&quot; of a large series of buildings. There was one home there, along with a barn, pens and sheds, and it had to cover a fairly large area. It was clearly the sign of a large operation in the ranching business. I sat nervously in the front seat while Molly crouched in the bed of the truck. Thankfully, the speed limit was twenty five miles per hour. As Frank Rhoer pulled his vehicle to a stop, we were met by an older man coming out from the house. He came right up to Molly as she hopped out of the truck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah so this is what they did,&quot; the man spoke and ran a hand down Molly's ar to feel her muscles, &quot;Very good.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then began to do the same thing with her legs. As he did so, I noticed the tip of Molly's tail twitch slowly. She did not like what the man was doing. He then returned his attention to Molly's hands, pressing on the tendons that extended her claws. Molly's tail continued to twitch, and the man didn't notice it. I then gasped in horror as the guy reached up to pull at Molly's lips. He was examining her the way one examined a horse! As he reached up to her lips, Molly gave a hissing growl that finally made the man break of his examination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Temperament needs work,&quot; the man dismissed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, would you be Mr. Beauregard?&quot; I asked getting his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; the man nodded, &quot;Pierre Beauregard, no relation to the Confederate General.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am George Wayne, Molly's boyfriend and &quot;legal expert&quot;,&quot; I spoke, &quot;Molly is not some mindless animal, and you came dangerously close to committing acts of blatant sexual harassment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what makes you think...&quot; Mr. Beauregard began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not like being manhandled by men I don't know,&quot; Molly growled, cutting him off, &quot;and you put your hands on my legs in a manner that I do not approve of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to see that you had good muscle tone,&quot; Mr. Beauregard answered, &quot;and your muscle tone is excellent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Contrary to my appearance, I am NOT a dumb animal,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;You would be better served to explain why you want to hire me. I have already been lied to about why I was wanted here. And if I'm nothing more then an animal to you, then our business is concluded, and George and I will be leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Beauregard stopped and blinked. He clearly did not expect that sort of response, which gave me the impression that he wanted a dumb animal for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see,&quot; Mr. Beauregard spoke, &quot;we have a problem out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is that?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolves,&quot; Mr. Beauregard answered, &quot;Wolves, Mountain Lions, and Grizzlies. All potential threats to ranchers. Now, I took my share in last year's wolf and lion season and I made sure that all my employees took their limit as well. The bears are protected by law, but aren't as common and seem to be more reclusive then the other too. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suppose you've done all you can,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, because they're still OUT there,&quot; Mr. Beauregard answered, &quot;still threatening my cattle. But I've seen the Nature and National Geographic specials, and that is where your girlfriend comes in. My idea is to have her guard my cattle. Tigers are bigger then Wolves and Mountain Lions and have been known to prey on bears. So her presence would be enough to keep them away... and if they do come close, she can kill them... which would be legal since she isn't actively hunting them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The animals here will not know what a Tiger is,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;and by my best guess, I'm somewhere between 300 and 400 pounds. A grizzly weighs around 800 pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But tigers prey on bears,&quot; Mr. Beauregard insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would depend on the tiger successfully ambushing the bear,&quot; I told him, &quot;animal predation is not a boxing match where both sides see each other coming. Surprise is the biggest key, and since predators generally target the sink or injured, the bears that tigers have fed on were not in the best condition. A healthy grizzly will expect Molly to back away, and wouldn't hesitate to kill her if she stood and fought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The biggest problems are Mountain Lions and Wolves though,&quot; Mr. Beauregard answered, &quot;both of which are smaller. Once they see how big and strong your girl is, they'll back down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolves might not,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;their strength is in their pack not in their individual members. I might be able to scare off one or two, but five might be willing to take the chance, and ten or more would be confident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because if I kill one or two wolves out of a group of ten, but the surviving wolves kill me, they would eat well,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah...&quot; Mr. Beauregard dismissed the entire argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you seem so intent on this?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;BECAUSE THEY'RE CATTLE KILLERS!&quot; Mr. Beauregard yelled, &quot;DIDN'T YOU READ LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD? THE THREE LITTLE PIGS? PETER AND THE WOLF? THE WOLF IS A DELIBERATE KILLER OF MAN AND LIVESTOCK! MY GRANDFATHER FOUGHT HARD TO MAKE THE WOLF EXTINCT IN THIS PART OF MONTANA AND NOW THOSE FUCKING LIBERAL TREE HUGGERS BROUGHT THE FUCKING DOG OF SATAN BACK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you've seen the Nature programs you should know that the Grey Wolf is nothing like the fairy tale wolves of Little Red Riding Hood and the other stories,&quot; I told him, &quot;and if you've done research, you'll have learned that here has never been a confirmed case of a health wolf or pack of wolves killing a human in North America.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about Europe then?&quot; Mr. Beauregard questioned, &quot;I know healthy wolves killed and ate people there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Fish and Wildlife officer that I've met told me that that was because of European wars,&quot; I told him, &quot;the armies fought and then left the bodies in shallow graves, or left to rot in the sun. Wolves scavenging after the battle then dug them up and became a accustomed to the taste of humans. If the armies had either buried the dead properly, or collected them to send them to their families... or better yet HAD no war to begin with, Europe might never have had the &quot;wolf&quot; problem that it did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know jack shit about wolves boy,&quot; Mr. Beauregard growled angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to guard your cattle?&quot; Molly growled back, tired of the argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect an hourly wage of nine dollars per hour and the right to set my own hours,&quot; Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect twenty square kilometers of land in that mountainous area, over there,&quot; Molly said pointing toward the forested mountains.<br />
<br />
Mr. Beauregard paused or a moment, &quot;I don't own that land, but I'll see what I can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect you to pay for the construction of a home there and for its furnishings, and making sure that the pipes are large enough to take my fur when I'm shedding,&quot; Molly continued.<br />
<br />
Mr. Beauregard didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also expect the right to take one cow as necessary to provide myself with meat outside of the autumn hunting season,&quot; Molly finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Mr. Beauregard roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a tigress, Mr. Beauregard, every bit a carnivore as a wolf,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;I need ten pounds of meat daily to maintain the muscles you value over my intelligence and dignity. And since hunting outside of hunting season would be a crime...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You propose to eat my profits!&quot; Mr. Beauregard answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it as an investment,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;you'd be providing for a worker that I've heard that you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the cost of my profits,&quot; Mr. Beauregard answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we have no deal,&quot; Molly answered, and turned to walk away, &quot;come along George, we're leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
I followed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly...&quot; Frank Rhoer spoke as we began to walk away. He had stood dumbfounded at the entire exchange and came running after us, &quot;please reconsider. I know he seems rough now, but he really is a good man to work for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle, he lead off the entire interview by treating me like I was a dumb animal... like I was a horse to be sold at auction,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;and the entire job was to have me roam about his ranch killing animals that have just as much right to live as his cattle do. If he wants to hunt them in their appropriate season, that is his business, but I will not become a hired gun for some greedy rancher. You want to work for an ass of a man like that, that is your business, Uncle. I will not work for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that we left Mr. Beauregard's ranch to head back to Frank Rhoer's home. We'd check out the town before returning home.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid ranchers,&quot; Dave grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all of them,&quot; I told him, &quot;just Beauregard.&quot;</p>
