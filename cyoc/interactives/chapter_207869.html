<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike hissed and coiled around Jeff&#39;s leg as he started to walk around the room. His actions speak ‘I want to play with you&#39;.<br />
 Jeff looks down to see Mike coiled around his leg staring at him with his feral eyes with no human intelligence or memories. Jeff understands that Mike is wanting to have fun. &quot;So you wanna play huh? Well do that. Let&#39;s play a game called Mouse and Snake.&quot; &quot;The game is simple Mike&quot; Jeff explained. &quot;All you have to do is locate the mouse I place in the house and then you can eat the mouse.&quot; Mike listened and nodded.<br />
Jeff continued &quot;Since we don&#39;t have a mouse I need to get one.&quot; He says. <br />
Jeff then thinks about how to get a mouse. Maybe I could transform into a mouse and then set the Chronivac to prevent me from dying and transform back. Jeff thought about it for a minute and decided to follow through with the idea. Jeff logs on to the chronivac and selects him on the program and makes the proper adjustments to his newly created form.<br />

Jeff looks at his new stats and finds that he&#39;s satisfied with his new stats for his body. He also finds that the transformation takes ten minutes. He figures that if it takes that long then he&#39;ll be fine. Jeff turns at Mike and says &quot;Mike, your mouse will be ready to be found in ten minutes so stay here until...&quot; Jeff paused and looked at Mike. Mike isn&#39;t as smart as he was when he had his memories as a human. And Jeff also knew Mike wouldn&#39;t be able to count to 10 minutes. So Jeff thought for a moment until he had a solution. He ran quickly into the kitchen and grabbed a timer clock and ran back to his room where Mike was at still. He took the knob and twist it until it read twelve minutes. &quot;Alright Mike, you&#39;ll stay here until the timer goes off. Then you can go and find the mouse.&quot; Jeff explained carefully. Mike nodded to Jeff clearly understanding the simple plan he heared from Jeff. Jeff then left the room to find a place to hide and wait for his transformation to begin. He hid behind the corner of his desk and waited for the timer to go off. He watched the clock and waited patiently for the minute to end. Considering his dad is currently a snake, Jeff wondered if he wants a friend. Maybe he should think about it more after he returns to normal. As Jeff waited for time to pass, he noticed his chest looked big. Jeff looked at his chest and must have realized that since he is turning into a female mouse he must be turning into a girl first. Noticing the chest expanding, Jeff looks around to see if anything else has changed.<br />
His hair is getting longer now, his body hair that has been growing since puberty is receding back, and his voice has changed too. &quot;Looks like I&#39;m almost a girl&quot; Jeff says to himself, and checks his lower part of his body to see if his manhood is changing. At his timing the manhood he had was almost gone and currently being replaced with a female one. Two minutes pass by and Jeff is now a full girl and begins to shrink slowly.<br />
The cloths on her body are starting to loosen and her arms are starting to grow light brown fur. It spread to her torso and up her neck, as well as down to her legs. The fur finally reached her feet and hands and had started shifting into her paws. Jeff then took off her cloths fully and went to look at her change now. She had fur everywhere but her head and her feet and arms are becoming paws. Some time passed, it had been 8 minutes and Jeff&#39;s body had gained a new shape and lost some of her human appearance like her breasts, legs, and arms. Her tail pops out of her butt and stretches out slowly until it reached out until it is two inches long. Her head was her last change before she finished the transformation with reality change. The fur began to reach the top of her head as the long hair she owned now receeded back until it was short. It then turned a light brown and finished becoming fur. The fur reaches her face and her eyes shut for a moment and reopened to find them lost of humanity. She still was there as plans on to stay that way as fur touches the last part of her humanity. Her mouth streaches out and her teeth shifts to a new set of teeth fitted for a mouse. The changes were completed, and finally the reality shift has altered Jeff&#39;s family. Her father turned snake Mike remembers Jeff but not the rest of Jeff&#39;s family and Mike now thinks he&#39;s owned by Jeff & Gregory Anderson.<br />
The Chronivac blasts the screen of Jeff&#39;s computer saying &quot;Changes Complete! Enjoy your changes.&quot;<br />
After the ten minutes where up Jeff takes one look at her new body.<br />
She tries to say something but nothing comes out but sqeeks. Jeff now ready&#39;s herself to hide somewhere until Mike finds her and truly decides her fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness I made sure Mike was taken care of if I were eaten. And only Mike can remember enough about me to play this game.&quot; She says to herself before hiding from the snake predator.<br />
Then she runs and hides somewhere and waits for Mike to find her so she can be eaten. In Jeff&#39;s room, the Chronivac turns off and locks itself, preventing anyone from accessing it. Mike waited patiently for the timer to count down to zero. And after waiting enough the timer finally went off and Mike started slithering off to locate the mouse.<br />
Mike starts to search the room to see if there is a mouse or anything. Mike only sees a pile of clothes under the desk in the corner of the room. That was nothing for Mike to worry about. Mike thinks Jeff is on vacation while his brother is watching him. Mike leaves the room after looking around and heads to the laundry room. He then proceeds to look in cracks and hole of cloths and shoes to see if the mouse was there. Nothing still, he leaves and heads to the kitchen. He heard a loud noise as he slither beneath the table to look. Apparently the mouse just jumped off the counter with a piece of cheese the size of a ping pong ball. Jeff was planning on eating one last thing before he might get eaten by Mike. Jeff hears a sound and sees a movement from the corner of her eye. She looks around and sees Mike slither towards her. Jeff starts to panic and tries to move, but it&#39;s to late Mike is faster. Mike catches up and coils around to prevent the mouse from escaping. Mike then proclaims &quot;Caught mouse now!&quot; Jeff is shocked. <br />
She can now understand Mike now. It seems he&#39;s limited in his communication. <br />
&quot;Yup you captured me Mike. So what would you want to do to me?&quot; Mike is struck. &quot;You sound like owner&quot; &quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s true Mike. I became the mouse I wanted you to find.&quot; Jeff explained <br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Mike replied &quot;Because I&#39;m the mouse and you&#39;re the snake. Plus I wanted you to have fun with me.&quot; Jeff says. <br />
Mike then proceeds to ask &quot;What now for you then?&quot;. <br />
&quot;That&#39;s the best part, you get to choose my fate.&quot; Jeff says before waiting for Mike&#39;s answer.</p>
