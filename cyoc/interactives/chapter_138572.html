<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After his rather successful Mental Training class, the rest of the day felt like a breeze to Ty. He chatted with friends as they walked from class to class, enjoying their company and the experience of going to a special school that had classes for metahumans. By the time the day was done, he was relaxing in his dorm room with Steve, Alex, and Milton. They had finished their classes, study period, and dinner, and were chatting about school, the classes and the teachers, and what the next day would be like. <br />
<br />
It took them a moment to notice Clyde, standing in the open doorway to the room. He looked uncharacteristically haggard, but held his head high when he saw they noticed him. &quot;Hey guys,&quot; he said simply, &quot;Hope your day went well.&quot; They looked at each other for a moment, then responded affirmatively. It was unusual for Clyde, the notoriously icy perfect student, to direct such pleasantries toward the other students. Clyde&#39;s eyes were fixed on one place: Ty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Ty,&quot; Clyde said, clearing his throat, after a long moment passed, &quot;I thought maybe we could practice some, like we did in Mental Training today. If you want, that is.&quot; Steve, Alex, and Milton stared in shock. They couldn&#39;t believe what they were hearing and seeing. Perfect Clyde was asking for Ty&#39;s help? To practice with him!? <br />
<br />
Ty just smiled, though. &quot;Sure thing. Why don&#39;t we go somewhere else, give my roommates peace so they can study,&quot; he suggested. <br />
<br />
Clyde quickly nodded and turned to walk away, then stopped. &quot;Bye, guys. Study hard,&quot; he said back to Ty&#39;s roommates, before resuming his walk, leaving the surprised trio behind. Smirking, Ty walked after him, following the taller student down the hall. Clyde moved quickly, taking several twists and turns before finally disappearing through a doorway. Ty followed, only to have the door shut behind him, as an unused office was revealed around him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this about, Clyde?&quot; Ty asked with a knowing smile. <br />
<br />
What little reserve Clyde had left was abandoned. He stepped forward, grabbed Ty&#39;s head, and planted a hard, desperate kiss on the shorter student&#39;s lips. He maintained the kiss for a full minute, until Ty pushed him back. <br />
<br />
Clyde&#39;s face was crestfallen as he took in the quizzical expression on Ty&#39;s face. &quot;I need you!&quot; Clyde babbled, stepping forward again, putting his hands on Ty&#39;s muscular shoulders. &quot;Ever since Mental Training this morning, I can&#39;t think of anything but you! I tried to distract myself, but nothing worked! Not academics, not exercise, not even fucking my buddies... nothing! I feel so empty when you&#39;re gone!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty was taken aback by the change in Clyde. Mr. Perfect Cool Reserve was gone, seemingly replaced by the desperate creature in front of him; Clyde reminded Ty of a junkie craving a hit. A twinge of guilt wormed its way into Ty. He reached his arms around Clyde, pulling the taller student in close, hugging him with his powerful arms. Clyde sighed happily. &quot;I&#39;m going to give you what you want,&quot; Ty purred. <br />
<br />
A moment later, Ty was standing before Clyde&#39;s mental wall. It looked sturdier than before, thicker and more elaborate. But there were also narrow windows in it. Ty stepped forward in Clyde&#39;s mindscape, peering through a window that allowed him to look past Clyde&#39;s mental defenses. Inside, Clyde was lying back on a couch, naked, slowly stroking himself, feeling Ty&#39;s psychic penis rub against his forehead. &quot;More...&quot; Clyde&#39;s psyche begged, writhing with need. Ty grinned, grabbing each side of the window. It was too narrow for him to fit through, but it made it easy for him to grip each side and pull. Ty&#39;s psychic form strained against the reinforced wall, the veins on his big muscles rising under the skin as he exerted himself. &quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; Clyde panted, watching Ty through the window, stroking himself faster. <br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s muscles surged, bloating with size and power as his mind became stronger. A moment later the wall came tumbling down around him, the heavy stone bouncing harmlessly off of Ty&#39;s massive muscles. Clyde cried out, feeling the psychic penis penetrate his head, pushing inside his brain. Ty&#39;s avatar strode forward through the rubble, his psychic dick sliding into Clyde&#39;s head at the same pace. On the couch, Clyde could only beat off furiously, panting with desire, growling with lust. Ty surged toward him, joining him on the couch, kissing him furiously. Clyde screamed with excitement, feeling Ty&#39;s psychic penis hit home, the big balls rubbing his forehead. Having his brain filled so completely... it felt incredible... and strangely familiar. <br />
<br />
Clyde&#39;s hands roamed Ty&#39;s huge form, exploring the massive muscles that adorned the avatar&#39;s powerful body. &quot;Fuck me,&quot; Clyde begged, bringing up one knee, rubbing it against the huge, hard rod that hung between Ty&#39;s legs. Ty didn&#39;t need to be told twice. He easily manhandled Clyde&#39;s body into position, his superior strength making it no trouble at all, then slowly pushed his dick into Clyde&#39;s eager hole. The shuddering gasp that emerged from Clyde&#39;s throat was music to Ty&#39;s ears--he grinned from ear to ear, listening to Clyde whimper in pain and pleasure as he was slowly invaded by Ty&#39;s huge tool. <br />
<br />
Clyde couldn&#39;t deny the ecstasy he was experiencing as he and Ty fucked inside his mind. But there was something else happening, too; he was slowly regaining the memories he lost, the last time Ty was in his head. Although the details were hazy, he remembered that Ty had been powerful--insanely powerful. He also remembered that he had been soundly defeated, and that Ty only seemed to grow more powerful, the more he was opposed. As Clyde gripped Ty&#39;s massive shoulders, holding on for dear life as the other student roughly fucked him, a plan slowly began to form. He would have to beat Ty with subterfuge, not brute opposition. A trap could be set. He would use Ty&#39;s own lust against him!</p>
