<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the backyard of the O&#39;Toole-Kirkman house, Morgan Carlson was sitting opposite of her cousin and apprentice, Anjelica O&#39;Toole-Kirkman. Since she and Stephanie had gotten back from the kitsune realm, Anjelica had insisted that Morgan teach her as much as she could to progress in her magic studies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now just close your eyes and concentrate on someone, anyone, it doesn&#39;t have to be someone specific, just think of someone close to you and try and see what they&#39;re doing right now...OH! and make sure it isn&#39;t anything....embarrassing. I once tried it when I was trying to find out something from my moms and....never mind. Just....be careful.&quot; Morgan warned her young apprentice.<br />
<br />
Anjelica focused her mind now thinking of her boyfriend Mason. He had called her and told her they were going to the kitsune realm for a family vacation a while ago since the war ended and Aaron came back. She now thought of Mason and saw him in the kitsune realm, training with his uncle Fukushu in his hybrid form as a couple of young kitsune girls looked on admiring his appearance and gave the two of them a little wave as they both giggled and walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Mason Harris, how dare he do that.&quot; Anjelica said losing her focus and snapping back to backyard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Morgan asked going over to hold her cousin&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw Mason, he&#39;s on a family vacation with his family in the kitsune realm and I could see him training with his uncle and there a couple of kitsune girls who were looking at him and....he waved back at them....it just made me so mad.&quot; Anjelica pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, jealousy, I get it. Listen, to your wise teacher Anjelica, when I was your age, I had the same kind of jealousy with Lynne from time to time. Making heads turn of the boys at school, competing in school competitions, wearing the exact same dress to prom, even though I told her what I would be wearing, and going out with a guy who for the longest time I just wanted to go up to and....I&#39;m sorry, I think I got off topic, my point is Anjelica, don&#39;t get jealous.&quot; Morgan said reassuring her young cousin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just.....a little worried some fancy kitsune girl will sweep him off his feet and he&#39;ll forget all about me.&quot; Anjelica admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? That doesn&#39;t sound like Mason to me. Trust me, next to his mothers and sisters, and his grandmother, you&#39;re the most important girl in the world to him.&quot; Morgan told Anjelica making her feel a little better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now.....what spell do you want to try tackling next?&quot; Anjelica asked as she shrugged unsure of just what to try next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anjelica, Morgan, come inside, there&#39;s a few people who want to see you.&quot; Jackie called out to her daughter and niece as they went inside to see who Jackie was talking about and gave a large smile when they saw who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings children,&quot; Marilyn proclaimed. &quot;I am Solar Guardian Mars! Protector of love and justice throughout the Solar system. My fires of love and passion will burn away the evils of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am the Solar Sentinel,&quot; Martin proclaimed. &quot;Earth bound Protector of the pretty Solar Guardians. My shield shall block all evil from harming the Solar Guardians on their mission of love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m your daughter, Ann, embarrassed that you two come over here in your youthful magical forms. You know what? I think I&#39;m calling Lisa and Jason, to see if they want to go out for drinks tonight.&quot; Ann said as she shook her head and took out her cellphone to call her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alcohol is almost never the answer to having a good night out on the town, ma&#39;am!&quot; Marilyn proclaimed as Morgan and Anjelica giggled at this, they loved it when they&#39;re grandparents came over in their solar guardian outfits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;ll just have wine.&quot; Ann said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get the car keys, Anjelica, if Morgan, and....grandma and grandpa leave, will you be safe here by yourself?&quot; Jackie asked her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mom, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Anjelica chuckled slightly.<br />
<br />
It sometimes seemed funny to her that despite her age, her mothers still treated her like she was a child, although maybe it was because she had been away in the kitsune realm for a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry ma&#39;am, we won&#39;t be leaving here for quite a while, we just thought it would be nice to visit our granddaughters.&quot; Solar Sentinel said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the more reason for us to leave, darling, come on, Lisa and Jason said they&#39;re up for a little wine tonight and lord knows I could use some now.&quot; Ann said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye sweetie, and have fun with grandma and grandpa!&quot; Jackie said blowing her daughter a kiss as she and Ann went out to their car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, grandma, grandpa, you can stop with the dramatics, my mothers are gone now.&quot; Anjelica said to her grandparents as they both now let out a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, it never fails to make me laugh whenever we come over and have a little laugh with one of the girls.&quot; Marilyn giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the one who laughs honey, the girls are more or less embarrassed.&quot; Martin pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well still, it&#39;s always fun to break out the Solar Guardian forms in front of them. Makes me feel like I&#39;m their young and beautiful sister.&quot; Marilyn said combing her fingers through her hair before shaking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what brings you two by anyway, besides embarrassing my mom.&quot; Anjelica asked half-joking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all our grandbabies are grown up and doing their own things now and well, you&#39;re our youngest grandbaby and we haven&#39;t seen you for a while now. Not since you came back from fighting in that frightening war.&quot; Marilyn said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you know sometimes it&#39;s just nice for me and your grandmother to spend time with our grandkids, even if they are too old for having fun with us.&quot; Martin commented making Anjelica think for a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I&#39;ll be getting home, it&#39;s been nice talking with you grandma and grandpa but.....ah!&quot; Morgan said she suddenly was struck by a spell from Anjelica and began regressing physically.<br />
<br />
Anjelica herself now used her own magic on herself to regress physically and soon enough, Morgan and Anjelica were now both physically ten years old with age appropriate clothing for both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anjelica, what did you do?!&quot; Young Morgan asked in a high voice as Anjelica giggled a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like grandpa said, they don&#39;t get to have much fun with their grandkids anymore so I thought it would be nice if they watched and played with us while my mommies are out.&quot; Anjelica explained as Marilyn picked up the now 10 year-old Morgan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Morgan sweetie, look at you, I haven&#39;t seen this adorable face in years, tell me do you still have your secret tummy tickle spot?&quot; Marilyn sweetly asked as Morgan crossed her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a secret tummy.....HA HA HA! STOP! GRANDMA, STOP IT! THAT TICKLES!&quot; Young Morgan laughed as Marilyn grinned at her currently young granddaughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa! I want to play knights and horses like when I was little!&quot; Young Anjelica said to Martin hopping up and down as Martin put Morgan on her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a brave knight that&#39;s also a magician girl and I&#39;m going to save the world!&quot; Young Anjelica said in a lisp remembering the gap in her teeth that she had at that age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Well I&#39;m your rival magician and I&#39;m going to save the world better than you can.&quot; Young Morgan said as she rode on Marilyn&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? Bet you can&#39;t do this. Water ball!&quot; Young Anjelica said as she conjured a ball of water that splashed onto Young Morgan&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Water ball!&quot; Young Morgan shouted as she returned her water ball fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t reach me!&quot; Young Anjelica taunted as she now created a force field to hold Young Morgan back from entering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? I&#39;ll change my mare is actually a beautiful princess in disguise and I&#39;m going to change her to human to distract your stallion.&quot; Young Morgan said as she used a spell that changed Marilyn&#39;s Solar Guardian outfit into a beautiful medieval dress.<br />
<br />
Martin&#39;s heart was beating seeing his wife in such a beautiful dress as she looked at him with loving eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m going to change my stallion into a handsome prince, so you&#39;ll lose your horse turned....princess.&quot; Young Anjelica giggled as she transformed Martin&#39;s Solar Sentinel uniform into clothes that made him look like a medieval prince.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my love, the spell that the children used to turn us into horses has broken and now we are once more back in each other&#39;s arms.&quot; Marilyn said playing along with her granddaughters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, now we can be married and you shall be my queen with a crown on your head. But whether you be a princess or a peasant, I care neither way, for my love for you burns brighter than anything I&#39;ve ever known before or since.&quot; Martin said as he and Marilyn embraced in a kiss as Young Anjelica and Young Morgan giggled at their grandparents playing along with them.<br />
<br />
Martin and Marilyn now changed their clothes back into civilian clothing as they looked at the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright girls, now what do you want to do?&quot; Marilyn asked as the girls thought for a moment.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there came a loud banging at the front door and Young Anjelica and Young Morgan got a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anjelica, sweetie, were your mother&#39;s expecting company tonight?&quot; Marilyn asked as Young Anjelica looked scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-N-No grandma, I don&#39;t know who that is.&quot; Young Anjelica replied as both she and Young Morgan held onto their grandmother&#39;s leg.<br />
<br />
Martin walked up to the front door and looked through the peephole to see a girl who looked about 17 looking at the door as she knocked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you miss?&quot; Martin called from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m helping my daughter sell girl scout cookies. I have a box right here if you&#39;d like them.&quot; The woman said not noticing the peephole on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not interested.&quot; Martin replied hoping the girl would take the hint and leave, but she didn&#39;t and just stood there for a moment and looked towards the side of the house, it seemed to Martin like she was motioning for someone to move along to the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marilyn, make sure the girls stay safe and out of sight.&quot; Martin said not wanting to frighten the girls.<br />
<br />
Marilyn nodded as she had the girls hide to stay safe prom potential danger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls listen, until we know what&#39;s going on, no using magic, okay?&quot; Marilyn instructed to them as the girls nodded hiding underneath the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
Marilyn now heard a sudden thump and looked towards the back door to see another young woman trying to force her way inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of here, or I&#39;m calling the cops!&quot; Marilyn shouted to the young woman as she broke the glass on the sliding back door and managed to open it as she forced Marilyn down to the ground. Marilyn was trying to fight her off as Martin ran over to help her, but the young woman pushed Martin aside and rushed towards the front door, unlocking it to let her partner inside.<br />
<br />
The two women held out large pocket knives at Martin and Marilyn as Young Morgan and Young Anjelica looked frightened and tried not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, whatever valuables you have, hand them over to us and we&#39;ll leave.&quot; The girl from the front door demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do that. This is my daughter&#39;s house and I won&#39;t steal from her.&quot; Marilyn said defiantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Maybe one of these rugrats will persuade you.&quot; The girl from the backdoor said as she grabbed Young Anjelica and held a knife close to her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, maybe we have your attention?&quot; The girl from the backdoor said as Young Anjelica tried her hardest not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave my cousin alone!&quot; Young Morgan said coming out from underneath the table and stomping her foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do little girl?&quot; The girl from the front door said as Young Morgan now concentrated her magic and began to physically age the girl from the front door into a thirty year-old woman as her friend looked shocked and confused.<br />
<br />
Young Anjelica now gathered her courage and used her own magic to regress the girl from the backdoor physically into a young girl of about 10 years old. Anjelica thought for a moment and then changed the girl&#39;s clothes into an actual girl scout&#39;s uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I see what you&#39;re doing here girls. We&#39;ll take them to the front door.&quot; Marilyn said as she and Martin guided the two towards the front door and placed them outside the front door as Young Anjelica used her magic to make a box of cookies appear in the girl&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
Young Anjelica and Young Morgan now used their magic to alter the two&#39;s memories and histories. Now the woman and child were a mother and her daughter traveling a little late out to sell cookies. Once the two girls were finished with the spell, the two snapped their fingers and looked around in slight confusion before looking at the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so sorry, but my daughter hasn&#39;t had much luck today selling a single box of cookies, do you think you could help us out?&quot; The new mother asked as the girl scout looked a little said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, here you go dear.&quot; Marilyn said as the girl scout was happy about having finally made a purchase.<br />
<br />
Anjelica now used her magic to age herself and Morgan back to their normal forms as they used their magic to fix the mess the two intruders had made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan, I&#39;m sorry, I know I shouldn&#39;t have gotten so scared back there.&quot; Anjelica apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Anjelica, it&#39;s perfectly alright to feel scared in a situation like we were just in. Plus you gotta remember, we&#39;re magic users and grandma and grandpa are basically superheroes.&quot; Morgan reminded her cousin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m the sexiest superhero, according to your grandpa that is.&quot; Marilyn said batting her eyes at Martin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross grandma.&quot; Anjelica said with a little laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t tell your mothers or your sister what happened tonight. You just had a nice time with us and that&#39;s all.&quot; Morgan said giving her cousin a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, we&#39;ve still got some time before your mothers come back, maybe the four of us can watch a movie together?&quot; Martin suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Anjelica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casablanca, starring the second most attractive man behind your grandfather.&quot; Marilyn teased as they went to find it online and watched it on Anjelica&#39;s living room TV.</p>
