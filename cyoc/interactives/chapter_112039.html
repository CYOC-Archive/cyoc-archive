<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In many ways, Melissa felt both in over her head and unready but excited like a kid in a candy store at the same time. The propensity to nudity struck her as fairly odd, but for Trevor, Rob, and Jason seemed more like their were forms were simply too big to adequately wear clothing when transformed. Their bodies had grown too big in order to wear their clothes, and Melissa noted that Trevor actually had to hunch down a little. <br />
<br />
She looked him over, and a private part of her was fairly interested, as while he was big, he wasn&#39;t misshapen in any way. His brownish black bovine nose was surrounded by a band of white fur with dark brownish gray fur behind it, that covered his face and went down his neck and shoulders. Just below his shoulders, the fur was a slightly lighter shade of brown, and this went all the way down to his feet, which ended in two hooves, just like any cow&#39;s foot did, but Trevor&#39;s legs looked fully capable of balancing on two legs, which even Melissa knew no normal cow could do. His ears had two toned fur to it. The outside of the ear was a light grayish brown while the inside of the ear was a grayish white and Melissa noted that Trevor could actually move his ears in his transformed state.  He had modest upturned horns, which she also noticed that Trevor did his best to make sure that they didn&#39;t hit the ceiling or anything else. He also had the biggest brown eyes that Melissa had ever seen that simply made him look gentle, despite his very muscular build for a fifteen year old. Trevor also kept one hand down between his legs, as if in a way to try and preserve his own modesty, though from what Melissa had seen, he had enough size to split a normal woman in half while in his transformed state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though given the size he gained,&quot; Melissa privately wondered to herself, &quot;Even if Moon Lake has inter-racial/species couples... I&#39;d probably need to be something big just to fit him... though I could probably see where the Greeks got their story of the Minotaur...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that she realized that she was borderline staring and looked away. Trevor never said anything and let Melissa sit quietly. Eventually Megumi did return with a soft cover book which she presented to Melissa. Melissa took it and noted the title as &quot;The Moon Lake Handbook.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go,&quot; Megumi said politely as she handed Melissa the book, &quot;This is the full handbook for Moon Lake and all the were species in residence. It&#39;ll cover all the pluses and potential minuses of each were species to a better degree than the introductory pamphlet does. Feel free to hold onto it until you our your dad make your choices on being a were and which.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Melissa answered carefully.<br />
<br />
Megumi nodded, &quot;and hopefully it helps... and even if you don&#39;t join us... hopefully we&#39;d at least get along and be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be nice,&quot; Melissa agreed, as she did genuinely think that friendship wouldn&#39;t a bad thing. Alice and Megumi seemed rather playful, but in the end they were respectful of her and her decisions. Rob and Jason were both friendly and calm as well, though a portion of Melissa&#39;s thoughts always seemed to come back to Trevor, though she supposed that was because Trevor was the first that she&#39;d met.<br />
<br />
They eventually settled into talking about more mundane things as Trevor and his friends turned to keep Melissa company and that everything didn&#39;t revolve around sex or weres or that sort of thing. They even worked on their homework for awhile, though around four fifteen, Melissa realized she needed to get home, as her father did expect her to be home after school and she hadn&#39;t been able to contact him that she was meeting with friends after school. Trevor was quick to turn back and volunteered to drive her home, which Melissa did accept.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Melissa said to him as she climbed into the driver&#39;s seat of Trevor&#39;s pickup with her book-bag and the complete handbook within sitting between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;everyone needs friends, and I&#39;d think with the &quot;weirdness&quot; that goes along with Moon Lake being a were sanctuary requires more of that. I mean there is a lot that is really unavoidable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded as Trevor began to drive along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think the handbook will help,&quot; Melissa commented.<br />
<br />
They rode silently for a few moments. Eventually a new question seized her.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were in my place... what would you choose to be?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Trevor glanced to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were in my place... what kind of were would you choose to be?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I... uh... I&#39;m pretty much comfortable with what I am,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;So, I&#39;d suppose I&#39;d choose to be a werecow...&quot;<br />
<br />
They rode along a little further until Trevor continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably for the fact that werecows are the strongest weres in Moon Lake,&quot; Trevor explained, &quot;We may not be as athletic as werehorses, but we&#39;re certainly stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could notice that, earlier,&quot; Melissa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d include female werecows, not just us bulls,&quot; Trevor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t they be...&quot; Melissa began, nervously and then pulled her hands over her mouth, as she didn&#39;t want to say anything that Trevor could take as an insult to his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over-sized?&quot; Trevor finished and gave a sigh, &quot;If you&#39;re concerned about breast sizes... I hate to tell you this, but the smallest cup size for a were is a D cup.  As I&#39;m sure you noticed, no were is petite. Werefox vixens are the most voluptuous with a perfect hourglass figure and an F cup chest, which Megumi will grow to fill out by the time she&#39;s physically mature. A female werecow will have hips that are just as wide as a werefox vixen&#39;s, but are more top heavy, yes... with their cup sizes ranging from H to J cups, depending on if their breed is based on beef cattle or dairy cattle, but that doesn&#39;t change a were&#39;s strengths or abilities. Alice and Megumi, despite being the closest to human sized in their fursonas are more than powerful enough to hold a human down... and that strength increases with all weres as you get to bigger ones in size, and that is true REGARDLESS of gender... So yes, a female werecow like my mom will have big breasts... but she is still very well toned with regard to her muscles and isn&#39;t burdened by her breasts or impeded by them. Nor would they change who a female werecow is on the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t mean anything mean,&quot; Melissa answered, noticing that Trevor&#39;s answer did sound highly defensive, which meant that what she said had the effect she didn&#39;t want, &quot;It&#39;s just that everything is so knew and different... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa looked down for a moment and then sighed, &quot;I&#39;m just putting my foot in my mouth aren&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand it&#39;s a big choice,&quot; Trevor answered with a sigh, his voice sounding a bit calmer now, &quot;how one looks shouldn&#39;t be the first thing for which were one chooses. I&#39;d become a werecow bull... because it is what I know and the strength that goes with it... not to look good, but to be able to do the right thing... protect friends and family... to be able to work hard and to show that strength can also be gentle. There are a lot of things out there that every where has to be careful with for fear that they&#39;d put too much strength into it and break it. I&#39;ve managed that fairly well and take pride in being able to show that despite all that I have... that I can be gentle too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s always a mix of strength and gentleness for any were in various situations,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;When I was five, a black bear wandered onto our family&#39;s farm/ranch... I was out by the stalls looking at some of our family&#39;s animals. The bear caught my scent... new I was a were and went on the attack...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It attacked you?&quot; Melissa gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It tried,&quot; Trevor nodded, &quot;as weres and mundane animals don&#39;t really mix all that well. Domestic pets and livestock may do fairly well... but mundane deer will fight to the death against werewolves, weretigers, werelions, werebears, and werepanthers to a far greater degree than they would their mundane equivalents and mundane predators may be far more willing to chase out a predatory were as competition or attack a &quot;prey&quot; based were as food. And the bear caught my scent and came charging...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom was close by and heard it coming,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;she shifted took it on head on. The bear roared and growled and swiped at her with its paws... My mom bellowed back at it and punched it twice knocking it back... but now engaged with a fully transformed were, the bear tried again to get at her and at me, but my mom wasn&#39;t going to let that happen and she put one horn through the bear&#39;s chest and lifted it into the air. It died hanging from her horn, but she wasn&#39;t going to let it hurt me. Dad had to pull it off and we had to call the game warden because of the attack... but the thing that I most remember, was my mom hugging me and telling me that everything would be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems like a lot,&quot; Melissa said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was, but it also shows the strength and power as well as the gentleness and kindness that goes for pretty much every were,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;but something that I&#39;d think is a real hallmark for werecows, be they a bull or cow.&quot;<br />
<br />
They rode along quietly for a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can choose to be whatever you wish if you end up being the family were,&quot; Trevor said slowly, &quot;and in the end what kind of were shouldn&#39;t matter... but please don&#39;t let physical appearance be the reason you choose one were species or reject a were species.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor then focused forward and kept to himself that he felt that Melissa was fairly cute and could be something more someday, if he could only help her get used to Moon Lake and all its ins and outs.</p>
