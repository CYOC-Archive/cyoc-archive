<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maybe it was due to the summer heat, but you found yourself absent mindedly wondering around the store. At some point in your wandering, you had apparently entered into the female section by mistake. Thankfully both Jay and Elliott were not nearby. <br />
<br />
You were about to leave the section when the clerk approached you with a soft and friendly smile. She didn&#39;t say a single word to you but just nodded her head understandingly, which confused you. She walked down one of the aisles and pulled a shoe box off the shelf, as well as pick up a package of panties, a frilly tank crop-top with a deep neckline, and some incredibly short shorts that appeared to have a skin tight fit to them. <br />
<br />
You watched her do all of this for no good reason, but what really shocked you was when she returned to you with the items and grabbed your hand. You were pulled along behind her and just did so without putting up any resistance. It was all just too surreal. <br />
<br />
She lead you to a dressing room and brought you inside with her. She then gave you a wink and set down the clothes she gathered. Then she stepped outside, leaving you behind with the clothes. You tried to explain yourself, to correct this misunderstanding, but the words just didn&#39;t come. <br />
<br />
You knew she was still standing there right outside the door, and was waiting for you to come out. So you let out a sigh and looked over the clothes she selected for you. To start with, you got undressed and put the panties on first. It didn&#39;t register in your head that as the panties traveled up your legs, your leg hair vanished. Nor that when you pulled them up, you had pulled your manhood up inside of you too, leaving behind the appearance of a smooth, flat crotch.<br />
<br />
Next was the shorts. They were a perfect fit for you, and even though they hugged each of your cheeks tightly. The minor wedgie didn&#39;t bother you one bit either. The legs were practically non-existent, as just an small bit of fabric formed them. Just enough to call them shorts.<br />
<br />
The white crop-top was easy. Just slide it on and adjust it to give you the best looking cleavage while minimizing the risk of one of your tits from popping out. Quick and simple. Plus it was pretty cute too, especially the lace designs. It was a little uncomfortable feeling the slight draft with your exposed, somewhat tone midriff though. You brushed a long strand of platinum blonde hair out of your eyes and tucked it behind your pierced ear.<br />
<br />
Lastly came the shoes. The cashier had selected a strapy pair of 4 inch tall stilettos that could easily pass for having a &quot;sandals look&quot;.  They fit like a dream too, and while not the most easy to walk in, were still more than comfortable enough to continuously wear them for quite a while. <br />
<br />
You stepped out of the changing room and the cashier nodded in approval. You feel really weird wearing all of this female attire. But her smile reassured you for some reason. She then hands you a thin black choker which you put on right away. She also gives you an extremely thin hoodie that you slip your forearms into the sleeves and just drape the rest around your lower back and waist. <br />
<br />
You take a few steps to show it all off for her, feeling your large chest and peach shaped ass bounce and jiggle with each and every step you take in your new heels. Your thigh length hair which was held within a simple messy ponytail bounced behind your back and your thin, fit waist really accentuated your seductive curves. <br />
<br />
When you returned to the cashier from your brief strut, she suddenly gives you a hug and you hug her back after suddenly feeling like you really wanted to. She breaks away from the hug after a few moments and says the first words you have ever heard from her. &quot;I hope you enjoy your new looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were confused once again by her, and before you can say anything, she leaves. The moment she breaks your line of sight. You suddenly realize the store around you. It no longer is quiet and the sound of other customers and the music on the radio playing can be heard. It was like you just came out of a weird trance or something. <br />
<br />
You look over and see the cashier about half way through some woman&#39;s purchases, which didn&#39;t make sense since she was just with you a moment ago. Then you suddenly remember why you came in here and what you should be doing right now. You look around for your friends and spot them over on the opposite side of the store. <br />
<br />
However, when you go to make your first step, something catches on the ground unexpectedly and causes you to stumble. The sound of heels clacking can be heard as you steady yourself, and you look down. <br />
<br />
The only thing you can see is an impressive rack with a gorgeous amount of cleavage. However, it is facing the wrong way, and there is no one in front of you. Which could only mean... now your face went pale. You grab one of the boobs and wince in pain as you feel your fingers clamp down hard onto your own chest, confirming your fear that these were not just any boobs. They were your boobs.<br />
<br />
The memory of everything that happened with the cashier just a moment ago came flooding back to you in perfect clarity and you wonder how could you have missed all of those signs? It was so blatantly obvious and yet it never registered within your mind. <br />
<br />
You hold up one of your feminine, manicured hands in front of you. It isn&#39;t anything like your former hand whatsoever. It is very clean and the skin is so soft and smooth. The same can also be said about pretty much every inch of your body. <br />
<br />
With no other option, you slowly make your way over to your friends. Even though you feel quite confident with walking in heels for some reason, you still take it slow as you are not entirely sure why you feel that way.<br />
<br />
When you get close enough to them, Jay notices you and waves. &quot;Find anything you like, Hannah?&quot; He asks fairly nonchalantly. Elliott looks up at you, but his face turns a bit red and he looks away. He does share his thoughts though. &quot;You setious Jay? If she wears any less clothing, she would be walking around naked.&quot; They both laugh and wait for you to say something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... what&#39;s going on here?&quot; You ask &quot;don&#39;t either of you guys find it weird that I am a woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I mean, we&#39;ve been friends for years already. So why would it be weird for you to be a woman?&quot; replies Elliott. Jay nods and adds, &quot;yeah, it&#39;s not like you were trying to hide it either. If anything, you seem to love flaunting your sexy body. Not that I mind of course. And if your top gives out from holding back the hopes and dreams of all men, I will gladly offer you my hands as a replacement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My, how chivalrous of you&quot; you say sarcasticly with a smirk. <br />
<br />
Jay then tosses you a balled up bit of black fabric. &quot;By the way, I think you might look good in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You catch it and unravel what turns out to be a micro bikini. The &quot;cups&quot; are hardly concealing and the bottom is just a g-string with slightly more fabric.<br />
<br />
You give Jay a cold look and put a hand on your hip. &quot;Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you? Of course I would look amazing in this. But it&#39;s not gonna happen no matter how cute the bikini you hand me is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t know that, maybe I find the perfect one and you feel so compelled to try it on you do so right then and there? I am not missing out on that view.&quot; Reaffirms Jay. <br />
<br />
You try holding back your laughter. &quot;Your so weird, man. Here, if you love it so much, you go try it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay passes and you and Elliott laughs at him. Then suddenly your awareness heightened once again, and you realize what you were doing once again. And it is becoming increasingly harder and harder to not think of yourself as Hannah.<br />
<br />
Finally, the cashier is freed up once again, so you quickly mame your way over to her.</p>
