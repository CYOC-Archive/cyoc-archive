<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian sitting down at the dining room table, while not exhausted after his first day at work; he wasn’t feeling restless like he has in the past. His mother Emily in her were-otter fursona serves him up a small sandwich and glass of milk and get his to tell him about his day. The first thing he describes is helping the kitchen staff as they prepare evening meals for the prisoners. Emily looks surprised, but the Andrew Curtis who was also there, briefly explained that a majority of the prisoners were the werewolves that killed Alyssa Cooper, while bringing Julie Stovall back to Moon Lake to face up to her crimes.<br />
<br />
Brian go ones to tell his mother how he had to help serve the meals to the prisoners and then met Julie behind bars.<br />
“I take it the young wer-mer,” Emily looking at Brian; “was surprised to see you there?”<br />
“Surprised yes,” Brian pausing between bites of his sandwich; “pleased? Not really. Julie was not happy to see me, but she still tried the proposition herself to me. As well as,” Brain shaking his head; “to my supervisor Steve, who is a wer-horse.”<br />
“How did looking at the card reader go,” Andrew asking; “I heard it went on the fritz again?”<br />
“It’s either an electrical issue,” Brian answering; “or you have faulty parts. The programming looks fine,” Brian explaining; “I couldn’t find anything wrong with the source code.”<br />
“Anything else,” Emily asked.<br />
“There was this hot looking wer-beaver there mom,” Brian smiling; “she knocked me for a loop when I saw her.”<br />
<br />
“Wer-beaver,” Emily looking confused; “they exist?”<br />
“Yes,” Andrew answers; “Brian here must be referring to Patricia. Her family moved down here from Canada recently. Apparently there is a whole colony of were-beavers up there that keep to themselves. Patricia’s family is the only were-beavers here in town at the moment.”<br />
“She said her family was from a place called,” Brian thinking for a second; “Fort Vermillion in Alberta?”<br />
“Yeah,” Andrew nodding; “that is not far from the were-beaver colony.”<br />
“So what else is there to know about this girl you are clearly head over heels for,” Emily asking.<br />
“She is sixteen,” Brian answering; “and will be attending Moon Lake high after winter break.” She also said her father works for Knight Industries as an environmental reclamation something or other.”<br />
“And,” Emily probing.<br />
“We are going to meet up at the lake tomorrow at around ten in the morning,” Brian answering.<br />
“Doing what,” Emily asking.<br />
“Mom,” Brian pleading; “enough. So can I meet up with her tomorrow?”<br />
“As long as you are back in time for dinner,” Emily answers; “I don’t see the issue.”<br />
“Thanks mom,” Brain getting up to kiss her muzzle as he races up the stairs.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
In his room; Brian quickly removes his clothes and assumes his wer-otter fursona. Grinning as he feels the thick brown fur rapidly covering him; making Brian feel warm. Brian then feels the usual tugging sensations as his tail grows out from his spine, ears migrating to the top of his head and becoming rounded while his short muzzle pushes out from his face and his nose reshapes to look like a dull black arrow head pointing up. Whiskers growing out from his muzzle as he flexes his hand as they become paw like and webbed. Looking down at his feet to see they are now paws and that Brain is now upright with a digitigrade stance; he notices his otter member poking out of his sheathe. This makes Brian smile through his muzzle as his change to a wer-otter is complete.<br />
<br />
Grabbing his secret phone and turning it on; Brain is a little sad yet relieved to not see any additional messages from Betty. Turing the phone off, Brian head to his regular phone; looking to see he has two new messages, both from Patricia, makes him growl in pleasure. Reading the first one; Brain nods as it only reconfirms of their meeting each other at the lake tomorrow. Looking at the second message blows him away as it is another photo of Patricia in her fursona. The picture the wer-beaver sent was an image of her furry beaver and furry finger spreading the lips open. Unable to contain himself;  Brian takes a paw to his now erect member and starts to stroke up and down, the picture clearly made him aroused and in need of some relief. Seeing the message below the picture only renews his desire to be with the wer-beaver.<br />
‘Hope you like what you see and can’t wait to explore tomorrow. ;-)’<br />
<br />
Brian moans as he feels his balls clenching, a roiling pressure travelling up his shaft. Quickly tossing the phone on his bed and grabbing some Kleenex just in time as he cums. Standing there and enjoying the self-induced orgasm for a moment; Brain quickly wipes up and head to the washroom to clean up even further. Re-entering his room to see the picture of Patricia’s furry nethers again and smiling; Brian composes a quick message.<br />
‘You are an eager beaver. I can’t wait to “swim” with you tomorrow. ;-)’<br />
Putting his phone down; Brian lays down on his bed smiling as he absently places a paw on his flaccid and receding member. Happily picturing him and Patricia engaging in a wild orgy, of animalistic rutting.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
With Brian upstairs enjoying his transformation and text messages; Andrew was listening to the message that was left on the answering machine. Looking pensive and shaking his head; Andrew could confirm that was George on the line.<br />
“The question now remain,” Andrew looking at Emily; “whether or not he is in town.”<br />
“It’s a shame I can’t afford caller i.d for my house phone,” Emily sighing; “we could do a reverse lookup on the phone number.”<br />
“Assuming of course,” Andrew accepting the decaffeinated  coffee from Emily’s paws and sipping it; “that the number wasn’t blocked.”<br />
“You think he’ll call again,” Emily asking.<br />
“That fact that he called you after ten years of walking out on you,” Andrew answering; “implies as much. Whether or not he knows,” Andrew putting his coffee down; “that he has been declared legally dead is another matter.”<br />
“If he knows,” Emily answering; “then he might be desperate for money. Money I don’t have,” Emily’s anger rising.<br />
“The first thing he’ll want to do is ask for the council’s help in undoing what Brain did,” Andrew speaking; “but once he does that,” Andrew smiling; “he will have a council scroll placed in his paws demanding and explanation as to why he ran out on you and Brian as well as restitution.”<br />
“But that’s only if he is in town,” Emily answering as she sips her decaffeinated coffee.<br />
“I’ll inform Rachael Gauldet about this,” Andrew getting up; “she is the wer-otter rep and will be dealing with George if he does show his muzzle in town.”<br />
“She most likely scare him to death,” Emily smiling as she gets up to escort Andrew out; “with her thick French accent and German vocabulary.”<br />
“If George does call again,” Andrew speaking as he reached the door; “try and get as much information as you can from him. Pay attention to what the sounds are behind his voice,” Andrew placing a hand on Emily’s furry shoulder; “try and get him to meet you someplace here in town.”<br />
“The Local Diner,” Emily sighing; “would seem like the safest place to meet, George wouldn’t try and start a scene there. Not with the chef ready to defend the waitress’s with a meat cleaver if necessary.”<br />
“Well I’ll leave that in your capable paws then,” Andrew responding as he leaves the Walker residence; Emily closing the door behind the wer-mer, she heads back into the kitchen to clean up before heading to bed herself.</p>
