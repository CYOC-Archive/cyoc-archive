<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the two got in the car, Luke noticed that his mom bought a booster seat.  He wanted to give her a hard time about that, but he reminded himself that this is only temporary.  She buckled him in and the two first headed out to buy some new clothes to fit Luke.  Luke didn&#39;t notice until leaving the car how big the world looked to him now, and it has been a while since his mom had to hold his hand.  The first store that they stopped was where they bought most of the boy clothes for Luke, and he could only watch as he had to try on many childish clothes.  This was also the first time that Luke saw himself in the mirror since the changes.<br />
<br />
Luke is now almost 2 feet shorter than he used to be, and he could tell that he made his return to his chubby days as he was slightly overweight as a kid.  His face was much rounder with his body, standing in the smallest underwear his mom could find, lacking any body hair.  His hair looked shorter again as his mom insisted on him keeping it short growing up.  He felt his body and was in disbelief at how smooth his body was now.  His front teeth have only started growing in between the baby teeth that he had been reunited with this morning.<br />
<br />
Over an hour later, Luke was finally finished at the first store, and his mom insisted to buying some nice clothes for pictures in case Luke is still a boy in the morning.  Another hour passed before his mom finally settled on a pair of slacks with a sweater vest and a dress shirt with some dress shoes.  There were plenty that he had to try on, the ones his mom chose were the ones she thought made him look &#39;handsome&#39;.  Luke blushed as his mom ruffled his hair after the comment, but he secretly admitted that he did look a little cute in those clothes.  After the clothes were paid for, Luke and his mom finally left and headed for the nearest McDonalds on the way home.<br />
<br />
The one that they went to happened to have an indoor playscape.  While waiting to order, Luke looked over at the playscape, and was tempted to try it again as it had been a while since he was last in there.  His mom had already noticed him eyeing the playscape.  &quot;Go ahead,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll let you know when the food is ready.&quot;  Not even a second later, Luke gave in to the temptation and made his way to the playscape.  As the minutes have passed, Luke was enjoying himself climbing up and sliding back down again as he was the right age and size to do so.  He didn&#39;t want to admit it, but he did find it fun and nostalgic to play on the playscape again, at least until his mom told him the food was ready.  After finishing his junior cheeseburger and fries, Luke played in the playscape for 10 more minutes before leaving with his mom.<br />
<br />
20 minutes later, the car pulled into the driveway and they were finally home.  Luke was on his way back inside when he eyed a group of some neighborhood kids that looked about his age as they were playing outside.  He was going to just ignore them and go inside when he heard one of the boys call him over.  With his mom not looking, Luke ran over to the boys, where he was quickly welcomed into their group.  He then spent the rest of the afternoon next door with those boys, behaving as if he was supposed to be this young.  When evening came, most of the boys went home, but one boy named Spencer asked Luke to stay for a sleepover later in the week, which Luke impulsively accepted.  He went home expecting his mom to be worried about where he was, but she was okay with what he did.<br />
<br />
When 8 o&#39;clock passed, it was almost time for bed, and Luke was reminded to sleep nude again in case he grows back up in the morning.  Before he was tucked in, his mother hugged him and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  &quot;Mom?&quot; Luke asked, embarrassed by her actions.  &quot;Sorry Luke, but seeing you this young again, I couldn&#39;t resist,&quot; his mom replied, &quot;It&#39;s not everyday that I could have my little boy back.&quot;  His mom then turned off the light and left the room right before Luke fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Luke looked at his body the next morning, and was quickly reunited with his older self as expected.  He remembered that his family had to take their pictures today, but then he glanced at the box of condoms that made him younger.  He could just ignore them for now, or take out another blue condom so that he could play with the neighbors some more.  He can also take out the pink condom and try being Lucy for a day; he was curious about being a girl.</p>
