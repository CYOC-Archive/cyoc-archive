<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary Bates was the chemistry teacher at the school.  Like any chemistry teacher he was pretty nerdy.  He also had never been lucky enough to find love, though it wasn't for lack of trying.  <br />
<br />
Gary had invented an excuse to go into the school library.  Something about making sure that there was enough &quot;academic&quot; reading material in the library's chemistry section.  Really he just wanted to talk to the school librarian, who he had a crush on.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Leah,&quot; he said, as he approached the desk.  &quot;I just came in to check on the chemistry section.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah Gorman, the librarian, was a slender woman with dark brown hair and hazel eyes.  Her face was thin, but quite pretty.  And she always wore those sexy glasses that librarians wear.  She dressed in a black and white blouse and brown pencil skirt, that made her look very sexy.  She seemed to know that she was the stereotypical sexy librarian, and she embraced it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Gary.  I'm sure the chemistry section hasn't changed since last time you checked...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's probably true...&quot; said Gary.  &quot;Say, would you be interested in grabbing a bite to eat this evening?  Maybe we'll even have a bit of chemistry...&quot;<br />
<br />
They both inwardly winced at the attempted joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gary...&quot; replied Leah.  &quot;You know I don't swing that way.  You're a nice guy and all, but I'm sorry, I just can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well... I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And Gary stepped away from the desk and made his way toward the chemistry section.  The thing was, he already knew she didn't swing that way.  And he wasn't really hoping to change that either.  He just wished he could change something about himself...<br />
<br />
Then he saw it.  There, on the desk.  A little note scratched onto a piece of paper.  Ahah!  Now he would find out what is so important to his students that they have to pass notes in class to discuss it.  He went over to the desk to read it.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, weird.  It didn't seem to be an ordinary note.  Those notes tended to be something on the order of &quot;Can you believe that person X slept with person Y?&quot;  No... this was different.  It seemed to be some kind of survey.  He wondered if someone was conducting a study.  Now that would be a first: high school students actually doing something academic?  Not likely...<br />
<br />
Still it was interesting enough for him to sit down and being reading:<br />
<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so bored, just sitting there. Here's a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
Gary read on to the first question:<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was a girl?&quot; thought Gary to himself.  That's an odd subject for a study.  Maybe it was supposed to test how well people understood the opposite gender?  Regardless, it was a very coincidental topic.  Gary had often considered what it would be like.  In fact he longed for it.  Unfortunately science had not advanced enough for him to truly fulfill his dream, so he contented himself with being a chemistry teacher.<br />
<br />
But since it was something he'd thought about, Gary saw no problem in answering the questions.  He dug out his favorite pen from his pocket and began to write:<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be feminine, but neat.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like it, but it wouldn't be my favorite color.&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn't quite realize that his handwriting now was a bit curvier and more feminine than before, and each letter was distinct from the rest.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be wavy.  In long, wide waves, not tight crimpy waves.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ruby red.  Forest green would be my second favorite.&quot;<br />
<br />
His hair, which was straight, curved slightly, falling onto his ears and forehead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark red.&quot;<br />
<br />
He absentmindedly brushed the hair the hair from off his forehead with his hand.  As he did so the color of his hair shifted from brown to dark red.  He was focused on the questions now, and a bit excited, so he didn't notice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Deep emerald green.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pigment of his irises shifted.<br />
<br />
Gary was beginning to craft his perfect image of a woman.  He'd be ecstatic to date such a woman, but the tickling thought of being such a woman was even more exciting to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like make-up?<br />
<br />
Gary liked feminine women, and he considered make-up as just natural for that femininity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  Most of the time I'd use it just to accentuate my beautiful face, but sometimes I'd go all out and experiment with all kinds of different make-up designs and styles.&quot;<br />
<br />
His face shifted and warped, becoming the face of a beautiful woman.  It had a small amount of foundation, eyeliner, and mascara.  Just enough to make his face shine with its natural beauty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty?<br />
<br />
&quot;Somewhat.  I'd stay in shape.  I'd enjoy running, hiking, and tennis.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
Once again, this was something that Gary thought was very feminine, and he liked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually, but not always.&quot;<br />
<br />
His shoes changed into dark purple pumps with a 4-inch heel.  Still he did not notice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt?<br />
<br />
Feminine again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  I'd prefer feminine clothing like dresses and skirts.  Tight jeans that accentuate my figure would be okay too.&quot;<br />
<br />
His slacks were replaced with a wavy emerald green skirt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I would have my ears pierced twice.  I'd wear a bracelet, an anklet, and a necklace, as well as several rings.  I'd also have a small nose piercing where I'd wear a little sparkly diamond.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each piece of jewelry appeared on him, with piercings added as necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?<br />
<br />
The thought excited him.  As he went to put pen to paper, he noticed the feminine bracelet he was wearing...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Gary said to himself.  He looked at his hand, then his eyes fell to his handwriting.  He suddenly became aware of his shoes... and his skirt.  He glanced around, panicked, but there was no one nearby.  As he turned his head his hair fell across his eyes and he saw his rich red locks.<br />
<br />
He couldn't believe it!  The note couldn't be magic, could it?  But there was no arguing with truth.  He had already begun to change.  Frightened he contemplated just throwing the note away.  Maybe he could find a way to go back to normal.  He'd figured it out before anything drastic happened.  But a nagging voice in his head told him this was the opportunity he'd always wanted.  He could finally become the woman of his dreams...<br />
<br />
As he contemplated, some writing appeared on the page:<br />
<br />
Do not stop.  If you continue, your dream will come true.  But if you stop, you will meet an unpleasant end.<br />
<br />
Gary gulped.  He didn't know what kind of magic could be behind this note, but he didn't want to test its wrath.  Plus, the note was right.  He could make his dream come true.  Steeling himself, he made his decision.  He decided to go forward with the questionnaire.  Just the thought of what was to come gave him a hard-on.<br />
<br />
He took a few deep breaths then put pen to paper once again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;C cup, and naturally very smooth, round, perky, and sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at his chest as two amazing C cup breasts grew.  He couldn't believe it.  It was really true!  He touched his new breasts.  He loved the feel of them.  Touching them sent tingles and shivers down his body, and his hard-on became, if possible, even harder.<br />
<br />
Gary smiled broadly.  He couldn't believe his luck!  He eagerly moved on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?<br />
<br />
This he had thought about too.  Gary like girls, and had always liked girls.  Even when thinking about being a woman he couldn't imagine not liking girls.  So he wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I'd be a lesbian, and I'd prefer very feminine girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to change, since indeed, it hadn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
<br />
Wondering about the limits of the magic, he decided to try something.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, because I'd be genetically hairless on all of my body except my head, eyebrows, and eyelashes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hair disappeared from his body.  His male package felt smoother than it had ever been before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?<br />
<br />
Gary knew what this question meant...<br />
<br />
&quot;Tampons.&quot; His hard-on disappeared quickly.  His penis shrunk down and inverted itself with an odd squelch.  Something shifted inside his pelvis, and Gary knew that now, for sure, he had become a woman.  He was now a her, and her heart raced with excitement at the thought.  She could feel the dampness between her legs, but she didn't want to take time out of the questionnaire to fully explore it now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 16: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be wearing an emerald green dress which my current skirt is part of.  It would have frills and a little ribbon, short sleeves, and a low neck line that shows off a bit of cleavage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her button-up shirt changed quickly.  It melded into her skirt and grew some frills around the circumference of the skirt.  Tied ribbon appeared on the front of the dress as the buttons disappeared.  Her sleeves became very short and exposed her smooth, hairless, dainty arms.  Cups appeared on the front and wrapped around Gary's breasts, and the shirt collar disappeared as the neckline moved down to just past her cleavage.  <br />
<br />
It felt amazing.  Gary had tried wearing women's clothing once or twice before, but now it just felt natural.  Her body actually fit into the dress just right.<br />
<br />
She continued to write.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have no specific preference and would wear any of the above.  I'd tend to wear bikini or briefs most often.  Sometimes I wouldn't wear anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her tightey whiteys morphed into a dark purple bikini-style panty.  It felt much better and more natural against her smooth lady parts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
<br />
She was still a chemistry teacher, so smart was definitely a must.  And why not improve a bit?<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Waves of knowledge flowed into Gary's mind.  She realized that some of her memories were being altered as she filled out the questions in order to fit her new self.  They hadn't settled yet since the questionnaire wasn't complete but she was curious as to how she would turn out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;A red, frilly, feminine bra that is cut low enough to show off ample cleavage while still offering support.  Since my breasts are pretty perky I don't always have to wear a bra, but I usually do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary's C cup breasts were suddenly cupped by a red, frilly, feminine bra.  She felt more comfortable with that little bit of support, and she appreciated the way it helped amplify her cleavage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes? (Don't lie)<br />
<br />
Gary put some thought into this question.  As her male self she was middle aged at 41, short for a guy at 5'6&quot;, and a little overweight at 170 lb.  She decided on a definite improvement.<br />
<br />
&quot;28 years old.  5'9&quot; without heels.&quot;  She did a quick calculation in her head and wrote: &quot;136 pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary felt her vantage point grow higher as she gained 3 inches.  Her gut receded into a flat tummy and her clothes resized themselves to match.  Her proportions shifted around; her waste got thinner and her hips got wider as her body took on a feminine shape.  She felt younger and more energetic.  She was pretty sure some lines had disappeared from her face.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 21: If you were a girl... what type of shoes are you wearing?<br />
<br />
She looked down at the shoes that had appeared before and decided she was satisfied with them.  She had other preferences too, however.<br />
<br />
&quot;I currently am wearing my 4-inch dark purple heels.  I love heeled shoes and I have a large collection in many different styles and heights, but I am not a big fan of platform shoes.  I also love boots--especially with heels--and have a good collection of them as well.  My feet are strong and flexible, and are very comfortable with wearing heels of any size or type.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary's shoes didn't change, but a quick search of her developing memories revealed many joyful shoe shopping trips and a closet with a rack full of shoes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 22: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I love lingerie, especially stockings and leggings, so I have a wide collection of them as well.  I am currently wearing thin, black, thigh-high, nylon stockings that come up to just above the hem of my dress.<br />
I also like gloves and wear them from time to time.  I like wearing long silky gloves with formal wear and lingerie, as well as a variety of other styles for any occasion.  Right now I'm wearing thin, black leather, wrist length, fingerless gloves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gloves appeared on her hands.  They felt comfortable to Gary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 23: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
Gary was waiting for a question like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be long wavy hair, that was long enough to reach my bottom.  I would enjoy styling it in a variety of ways, but for simple purposes I would wear it in a pony tail with several hair bands along the length, or as an intricate braid.  I would an expert at styling and braiding hair.  Additionally, my hair would be very soft but also strong and I would not have any problems with frizz or split ends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary's hair flowed out from her head, growing all the way down to her bottom.  It was in a pony tail and wrapped with several dark purple bows along its length.  <br />
<br />
<br />
She was beginning to feel complete.  She felt so comfortable with her new female body.  She didn't know how it had happened, but it was a dream come true.  With these feelings, she looked at the final question:<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 24: If you were a girl... what would your name be?<br />
<br />
She thought about this for quite some time.  She considered and rejected many names, then finally decided.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name would be Katherine Cecilia Bates.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that she was complete.  Katherine looked at the last line on the page.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to have a happy life as a woman, pass this on to the next person.  Male or female, it doesn't matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; thought Katherine.  &quot;I wonder who it should go to.  Who would need it?&quot;  Then she spied a backpack alone near one of the desks.  It looked pretty nondescript.  Who knew who owned the backpack?  Deciding that was random enough, Katherine stuffed the note into the outside pocket.<br />
<br />
Katherine decided she would go take a closer look at her new self and headed for the library restrooms...</p>
