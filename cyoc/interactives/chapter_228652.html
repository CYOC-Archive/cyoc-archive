<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want to know what it feels like to have my breasts grow…” Liz tapped at the remote playfully then looked down at her breasts. “I’ve always been a bit small…” She poked one of her breasts with her finger. Her loose shirt did a pretty good job of hiding the actual curve of her breasts. Todd had a look closely to see the tiny fold in her button-up shirt that her B cup breasts made. “I’ve been content with what I’ve been given to work with here, but why settle when I can have exactly what I want? Let’s have some fun!”<br />
“Oh, I think I can arrange that,” Todd responded. “Scoot over so I can get up.”<br />
<br />
Liz shifted on the couch and raised her head from Todd’s shoulder. Todd stood and walked a few feet away from her. As he fiddled with the remote, he saw Liz was barely able to contain her excitement. She was squirming in her seat and pursing her lips, trying not to look too immature. She was failing. Liz looked like a child on Christmas morning. She was tapping her foot on the ground and eventually her pursed lips broke into a giddy smile. She obviously couldn’t wait any longer. Then, as if to soothe her anxiety, Todd announced that he had finished making the necessary settings. He held up the remote and wiggled it back and forth.<br />
<br />
“You ready?”<br />
<br />
Liz nodded her head, afraid that if she spoke, her voice would betray what her body already had. She glanced down again at her chest. The flat view she had seen every day while tying her shoes, putting on her shirt, climbing into bed; it was about to change. She knew that she was about to feel something that no one else in the whole world had felt and her boyfriend would be the first to see. Her heart started to beat a bit faster thinking about what it would feel like to grow so quickly. Liz started to think about what a scientific marvel the remote was. Then she realized she didn’t actually know how the remote worked its changes. What if it went wrong? HOW could it could go wrong? What if it was actually painful? What if it was something out of a horror movie? She hadn’t seen how the remote interacts with people. She’d only seen the TV grow and the money appear. Dozens of disturbing possibilities flooded the once excited mind of Liz. Then, Todd pointed the remote at her and clicked a button.<br />
<br />
Liz froze. He pressed it. It was going to happen now. She clenched her eyes and tensed up. Whether she liked it or not, the remote was going to change her. She might as well grit her teeth and bear it. At the end of the day, her breasts would grow, one way or another. <br />
Nothing seemed to happen. Liz waited for a few moments, searching for any kind of feeling, any kind of supernatural sign that the process was starting. Nothing. She looked up at Todd, who was staring intently at the remote, eyebrows furrowed. He murmured, “Well that’s weird…”<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” Liz said in a panicked voice, jumping up from the couch. <br />
<br />
“Well, I think it’s out of batteries. I forgot this thing uses them. It’s going to take a few hours to charge back up.” <br />
Liz’s heart sank. <br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me?! You get me all worked up about growing my breasts and you FORGOT that your magic God device takes batteries?” Liz flailed her arms in disbelief. “You built a device that can do anything and somehow you couldn’t figure out how to make it not use fucking batteries?” Liz continued her rant until she noticed that Todd was trying to contain his laughter. Liz stopped and squinted accusingly at him. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t use batteries, does it,” Liz said flatly. She folded her arms and scowled at Todd, who was now fighting a losing battle of containing his laughter. Finally, he broke and laughed heavily. It was infectious. Although Liz was still mad, she realized that she had worked herself so much that the experience was actually scary. She started off so excited and then convinced herself that it was going to be horrible. It took her a minute of sorting through her emotions, but she realized that she shouldn’t have been angry at Todd for messing with her when she was scared about something dumb. Plus, she did think it was pretty funny that she actually fell for such an obvious lie. With Todd still laughing, she found herself starting to laugh along with him. All the fear and nervousness about the process vanished. After a few minutes of laughing, calming down, looking at one another and laughing again, the two calmed down long enough for Todd to talk.<br />
“You looked really scared, Liz. You were so excited but at the last minute, you got this look on your face like you just made a horrible decision. It kind of freaked me out. I didn’t want to go through with it unless you were okay.” Liz wiped away a tear from laughing and explained what she had thought was going to happen. Todd put his hand on her shoulder and spoke gravely. “Yes, Liz. I programmed the remote to make your tits explode out of you with blood and gore. That was my whole plan. I spent all this time buttering you up to kill you when you least expect it.” Todd looked at Liz with a “are you kidding me” face. Liz shook her head and tried to hide how embarrassed she was. Todd continued, “I won’t do anything that you don’t want, Liz. We’re here to have fun, not torture each other. Who would do something like that? I mean, I don’t mean to kink shame fetishes, cause, you know… breast expansion and probably other stuff is going on today, but I’m not into gore and torture. And I hope you aren’t either cause that’s going to suck for me when it’s your turn with the remote.”<br />
<br />
With all doubts gone, Liz sat back down on the couch and put her finger to her lip.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. I don’t THINK I’m into gore, but we can certainly try.”<br />
<br />
“Please don’t.”<br />
<br />
With a smile, Liz waved away the comment. “Fine, if you say so. Now, are we going to mess with the laws of nature or not?”<br />
<br />
“Alright, for real this time. You ready?”<br />
<br />
“Ready. Let it rip.” Liz started to settle back onto the couch when her eyes went a little wide. “Ah, not literally though.”<br />
<br />
With that, Todd pointed the remote once again at Liz and pressed the button, for real this time.<br />
Just like before, nothing seemed to happen initially. Liz was getting ready to scold Todd a second time when she felt something twinge within her. Her heart started to beat a little faster. <br />
<br />
“I think this is it!” Liz exclaimed. “I feel something!”<br />
<br />
Liz shifted back and forth on the couch, waiting for what would happen next. It didn’t take long before her heart beat even faster. Liz started to breath a little heavier, both from the accelerated heart beat and because that twinge had moved to between her legs. It wasn’t strong, but it was enough for her to notice. Liz looked down at her chest, watching it rise and fall. It rose up with each breath, then down with each exhale. Up, then down. Up, then down. Up, then down. Liz started to squirm uncomfortably as the feeling between her legs became stronger. <br />
<br />
“Todd…” Liz breathed out, “This is starting to feel really good…” She started to move her hand towards her pants and started to rub her thighs slowly. She was obviously holding back in front of Todd. Her heavy breathing continued. Up, down. Up, down. Up, up. Liz gasped. She looked at her chest. When her chest fell, her breasts lagged behind. “Todd! They grew a little! Look!”<br />
Todd moved forward to look at Liz’s breasts. He couldn’t see a change. “Are you sure? I set it to start the process but I don’t think they’ve actually grown yet.”<br />
<br />
“Look closer!” Liz stopped rubbing one of her thighs and pulled Todd to his knees in front of her. He was so close to her breasts that his breath was blowing against them. Suddenly, he saw some movement behind the shirt. Small, barely noticeable movement, but it was confirmation that her breasts were indeed growing. “I felt them grow again! You saw, right?” Liz was doing her best to talk between her exhalations growing heavier. If Todd hadn’t been staring at her the whole time, he would have thought she had just come back from jogging.<br />
<br />
“I saw them,” Todd chuckled. “They grew literally right in front of my eyes!” Todd felt a tingle in his chest from his invention working spectacularly. Either that or arousal from being pulled into a woman’s chest. Liz breathed in deep and Todd saw her breasts rise again. They still weren’t big by any stretch of the imagination, but they were visible now. Todd could see them clearly even as he stood back up. The shirt had a noticeable bump where her newly forming breasts laid behind. Todd knew there was going to be more than a bump on the shirt when Liz was done growing. Liz continued to control her breath as best she could, but with the excitement of her breasts growing and the process turning her on, she was having trouble. Then, another growth. Liz moaned and placed her hand over them. They now fit comfortably in her cupped palm. <br />
<br />
“I can actually feel them through my shirt!” she exclaimed. I’ve never been able to do that. Any time I wanted to play with them, I had to take off my top! Todd, you don’t know how good this feels.” With another surge, the breasts continued to fill the shirt out. Liz now had a noticeable bust, even from a distance. Liz started to rub them gently. She realized that as she caressed them, they actually moved a little. She rubbed them a bit harder, soaking in the fact they had some mass to them now. Another growth. Liz was holding them when they grew, feeling the flesh fill them, making them bigger, more plentiful. They were a decent size now, enough for any woman to consider them averagely sized. Liz’s bra was starting to feel a bit cramped, which caused her some discomfort. Todd came to the same realization when he thought about how big her breasts were now compared to the bra that held their original size.<br />
“Do you want to pause the growth and take your bra off? I bet it hurts,” Todd sympathized.<br />
<br />
“No! No.” Liz grunted instantly. “I want to grow out of this stupid bra and break it.” Liz had a face that told Todd “This has been a long time coming”. Todd smiled. If he were in her shoes, or in this case, bra, he’d probably want the same thing. Listening closely, Todd could hear the fabric of the shirt begin to rustle. Their size was now rubbing against the shirt as they grew. With her hands still on her breasts, Liz kept her arms stiff, feeling the flesh push against her hands, trying desperately to grow more. When she couldn’t take it anymore, she laid her arms back down, and her breasts marched onwards once again. The bump of the shirt had now become a hill with dreams of being a mountain. The bra behind the shirt was audibly creaking, holding true to its purpose, but Liz and Todd both knew that it was a losing battle. <br />
<br />
“It’s really starting to hurt. I need this thing to break,” Liz grunted. She stopped rubbing her thighs and looked more serious. Second by second, centimeter by centimeter, the bra held the rising flesh in place. With all possible space in the cups filled, the flesh starting to overflow. Like rising dough, the breasts starting to push upwards over the bra and into the actual shirt. The bra’s band was cutting into Liz’s back as if a much-too-small rubber band was placed around her. Liz’s heavy breathing became shallow. Her own breasts were constricting her chest enough that it prevented her from breathing all the way in. Todd readied himself to jump in and rescue her if this got too dangerous. Liz breathed in as deep as she could, causing the bra to creak louder than ever. It was the sound of a dying soldier desperate to hold on till the very end. Liz began to suck in air as if her life depended on it, which it most likely would in a few minutes. Her breasts wanted to be free. They just needed some help. Liz arched her back and breathed in deeper than she ever had before. The bra was practically screaming. Anyone in the whole room would be able to hear the fabric of the bra begin to tear. Her breasts were practically growing along the length of her body with how much they were squished in the bra. More ripping sounds could be heard from underneath the shirt. The bra was almost gone. Liz started to speak again. <br />
<br />
“Yes! Yes! I. Need. You. To-” With a cry of ecstasy, Liz felt the last of the band wither away and the confines of the bra shatter. “BREAK. Oh God. Oh man, that felt good. I feel- Oh. OH.” Liz stared down at her chest once more. Free from the bra, the breasts’ size became apparent. Their awe was stifled before. Now, they shone with all their majesty. Liz’s hill had rocketed forward into the restriction of the shirt. Women would kill for a chest like the one Liz had. With the bra gone, the true weight of the orbs dawned on her. She had to lean back slightly to offset the two newly grown assets. They were now big enough to properly be called tits.<br />
<br />
Liz was losing her mind in ecstasy. She groped both breasts and lifted them, feeling the weight leave her back and enter her hands. She squished and rolled them, feeling new sensations that she thought only other women would be able to feel. The pride of owning these, the looks she would get when she walked down the street, the turn on of having to buy new clothes that would fit her; all these thoughts crossed her mind as she played with her new tits. She carefully moved them up and down in her hands, feeling the weight shift and wobble. They had grown so much, and they didn’t seem to want to stop growing there. Releasing her prizes, they fell back down. The tits surged forward again in small bursts, each time causing a shot of pleasure run through Liz’s body. The hill was now finally growing into a mountain. Liz watched in wonder as she started to lose sight of the area beneath her engorged chest. She would need a mirror to see that area now. Each growth caused Liz to gasp sharply. Suddenly, Liz felt a breeze on her midsection. She reached down and felt where the hem of her shirt was, only to find that it was lifted away from her body by her inflating tits. They had grown so large that the shirt didn’t have enough fabric to accommodate the bust. The front of her shirt grew taut. There was no more room to grow forward. From one prison to another, though this none wasn’t going to kill her. It was the buttons’ job now to hold the line. Todd, having been silent for a while to allow Liz have her fun, spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Is it everything you’d hoped for?” he said cheekily. <br />
<br />
“GOD yes. This is- hmmm- This is the be-est thing I’ve ever fe-Elt!” From the tone in her voice, Liz seemed to fighting to speak through the rivers of pleasure her new body was giving her. “I don’t want it to stop. Pleasedon’tmakeitstop. Please.”<br />
“I won’t,” Todd promised her. “I won’t stop it until you say so.”<br />
“Good, cause I need MORE of this, Todd. I really do.” <br />
<br />
“I can grow and shrink you as much as you want, Liz. Have fun.” With that, Liz turned her attention back to her tits, which were making a daring move of repeating their battle strategy against the bra. With nowhere to go, the started to rise upwards. Like a 3D movie, Liz saw her breasts coming to meet her though the neck of the shirt. <br />
<br />
Tit flesh was oozing through the front of the shirt, desperate to find another path to freedom. This only worked for a few seconds before they went as far as they could go. The shirt looked like Liz had stuffed large pillows underneath. Every area her developing breasts touched the shirt was pulled until no slack was left at all.<br />
<br />
Something had to give. The button directly over the front of her chest was creaking now. Liz started to antagonize it.<br />
<br />
“Come on you little button! Break! Make room for my tits!” She started to massage her legs again, this time much more sensually. Todd saw that the Liz was getting too horny to care about someone else being in the room. The button continued to creak. The button began to pull apart until it was just a string holding it together. Liz panted desperately like an animal in heat. Todd couldn’t see it, but he bet that Liz was starting to leak. There was no way she wasn’t based off the way her mouth was hanging open. Drool spilled out of her mouth and pooled in her soft cleavage. The button held on for dear life until Liz’s body shuddered from an orgasm. <br />
<br />
*POP*<br />
<br />
The button was there one second and gone the next. It flew so hard that Todd didn’t see it rip off the shirt. He only heard the sound of it hitting something across the room. With freedom in sight, the mountains continued their growth. The open area was quickly filled to brim with creamy tit flesh.<br />
<br />
“Todd! I need you to come-” Liz went silent with a squeak and shuddered from another orgasm. “COME here, ri-ight now.” Todd obliged, knowing that whatever she needed, it was probably going to be something he wouldn’t want to turn down. He took a few steps forward to stand in front of Liz. Fighting desperately to speak intelligible words, Liz continued, “I need you to fuck my tits. Right now. I need you to fuck them! PLEEEEASE fuck my tits!” Without another word, Todd dropped his pants and pulled out his cock. Liz pointed at the newly opened hole from where the button flew off. “Right here. Just jam it in there. I need to feel that warm cock in my tits~!” Todd Once again obliged. He gripped his dick and positioned his head right at the entrance to the crevice between Liz’s pillows. With no hesitation, he thrust in and instantly knew that making the remote was the best decision of his life. The feeling was like no other. The confines of the once-roomy shirt squished the tits together so much that it felt like he was fucking an actual hole. The breasts surrounded him from all angles, even on top of and below his dick. Each thrust in, he felt his dick go from the cool air of the room to a steamy cushion of pleasure. Each pull out rubbed the underside of his head and cooled it off in the air for a brief respite before diving back in for more. <br />
Todd was in heaven. <br />
<br />
He started to moan with each thrust, not being able to contain how horny this was making him. Liz followed in kind. The two adults’ moaning must have alerted the whole dorm room floor of what was going on, but they didn’t care. Even if they didn’t have the remote to remove this from the neighbors’ memories, it would still worth it. As Todd kept fucking, each thrust started to feel tighter and tighter. <br />
Liz was still growing.<br />
<br />
Tighter, tighter. The mountains were practically screaming to be released from the shirt, but they would have to work for it. Liz looked down into her ever-expanding cleavage and saw the top button was about the follow their fallen brother into the afterlife. “Harder Todd! Ram me! Slam my tits!” Liz practically tore off her pants and thrust one hand’s two middle fingers into her slit while she sucked on the other hand’s. Todd fucked even harder, heedless of where his shaft ended and where the tits began. His pelvis slammed into the wall of flesh in front of him. Ripples cascading across the mountains. He pulled out and did it again. He was fucking as hard as he could and the impact was cushioned like air bags. Now he was the one who felt like an animal in heat. All limiters were off. His full attention was on watching his dick disappear in the sea of flesh barely contained by the thin fabric of Liz’s shirt. Each slam into her tits sent a shockwave that he could feel travel from his balls to the head, tits seemingly massaging the shaft as the impact traveled. This seemed to be enough for the top button to lose morale.<br />
<br />
*POP*<br />
<br />
Like the first, it was there one moment, gone the next. <br />
<br />
*POP* *POP* POP*<br />
<br />
Three more buttons followed suit. Todd broke his feverish stare and saw the rising pudding of flesh creep up out of the newly formed escape. He was close. He needed to fuck these tits so hard that the shirt rips clean off. He grunted even harder, using more of his legs to get a rising thrust instead of a straightforward one. Each button ripped off was a victory. Liz looked desperate. Liz cried out, “FUCK. I need more!” She added one more finger to her masturbation and started to practically yell out moaning. Todd was close behind. This was the tightest tit fuck he had ever done. It was getting difficult to thrust his whole dick into her cleavage due to how large her tits were getting inside such a comparatively small shirt. And unfortunately, he was getting tired.<br />
It was do or die. <br />
<br />
With the last of his energy, he gripped Liz’s shoulders for maximum leverage and used both his legs and hips to almost jump into her tits. Todd exploded between the massive jugs in a euphoric climax. The added volume of his dick in the prison of flesh and the unique angle sent a ripple through the flesh that was just enough for the shirt to waive its white flag. The couple could practically see the tits bounce upwards like a wave, snapping each button off on its way towards Liz’s head. Liz climaxed right as the buttons were flying off, flooding her already soaked pants with cum. With that, the shirt was no more. All of the upper buttons were torn off, leaving Liz’s massive tits to rest on a shelf of the bottom half of the shirt for Todd to see plainly. They were perfect. Firm and shapely, but large enough to practically be an ocean of soft and fragrant flesh. They were so large that even without her bra, they still made a deep line cleavage. Liz spoke up after some effort. “These are perfect. St-Stop the growth now.”<br />
<br />
Todd got the remote and dialed a few buttons, stopping the growth, and crashed onto the couch next to Liz. He placed his head on her shoulder and closed his eyes in bliss. He placed a hand on the side of one of the heaving breasts next him and slowly massaged it. Liz stuck her hand into the sticky mess between her tits and licked some of Todd’s cum off her hand. Liz whispered breathlessly, “That was the best fuck I have ever had. God, I love you, Todd.” She leaned her head over, gave Todd’s head a kiss, and cradled his head in hers.</p>
