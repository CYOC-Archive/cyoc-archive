<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the world stopped spinning Heather dove for her phone. At first she was just going to select &#39;force non-sexual&#39; and never think about it again, but some inner voice told her to open the sex menu instead. She gave in and hit the little arrow to see what kind of settings she had been working with this whole time.<br />
<br />
The menu was surprisingly long and had several more sub-menus. Many of the settings had names that she didn&#39;t understand and the ones she did were somewhat alarming. She quickly turned off &#39;force sexual submissiveness&#39; and set &#39;sex toy availability&#39; as low as it would go. She googled several of the others and immediately turned them off after seeing the results. After poking through the BDSM sub-menu she turned that option off entirely. She made her way down the list, tweaking and turning off the various options until she reached the bottom of the page, then went back through and double checked each and every one of them. The only ones she didn&#39;t mess with were the ones that even google had no results for and when she had selected them she got a pop-up warning her to be careful changing them. She would deal with those once she got more information.<br />
<br />
With the sex menu sorted out she turned her attention to the other settings she had skipped over. Most of them were innocuous and Heather left them alone. She found the menu for world effects and turned most of them off. The changes that had been made to Gabby&#39;s daycare scared her a little. The new settings she chose made it so that she would be the only diapered teen in the scenario and the rest of the world would be unchanged. She liked it better that way. She wanted to be unique.<br />
<br />
The next menu she selected was the awareness menu. This one had several pages of warnings about the various side-effects that each setting could potentially have if changed. Heather scrolled through them and decided it would be best to not mess with them at all. Every single one she looked at she could immediately see how it would backfire to change it. At the bottom of the list she found a greyed-out setting titled &#39;tandem play (beta).&#39; She tapped on it and got a pop-up explaining that tandem play was only available to beta-testers and a link to more information. She tapped that link and was brought to the BIG TOTS website.<br />
<br />
The page listed all the various options available to beta-testers including tandem play, persistent effects, timed scenarios, and even one labeled &#39;physical effects (coming soon).&#39; There was a warning about beta features being unstable and that while they would be backed up by BIG TOTS developers beta testers were mostly on their own when dealing with unforeseen side-effects. Heather made a mental note to come back to this and flipped back to the BIG TOTS app.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t much left to look at in the settings menu so she decided to see if the app had anything else to offer. She noticed a red exclamation mark in the upper right corner and tapped that. To her horror she was greeted with a mosaic of all the pictures of herself she had saved from Facebook and Instagram during the scenario. At the top was a message asking her if she wanted to save the pictures to her phone or discard them. Her finger went automatically to the discard button, but she didn&#39;t tap it. As she looked at the thumbnails she was struck with a perverse sense of pride. These pictures were the only evidence of that other reality created by the diapers. She didn&#39;t have to share them with anyone. She began to wonder what would happen if she took pictures herself, not just saved them from the internet. And what about other things like movies and games? Could she create a scenario where diapers were featured in films and save those? She saved the pictures she had now and decided to test her theories later.<br />
<br />
At this point her bladder reminded her that she had been holding it for quite some time now. She closed her eyes, relaxed, and let the warmth spread through her diaper. This was what she liked best. This freedom. This comfort. An image of Mel&#39;s face between her thighs popped into her head. Her eyes snapped open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel.&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
How much of that was the scenario, and how much of that was just pure Mel? The website said that it couldn&#39;t force anyone outside the user to do anything against their will. Did this mean that Mel wanted to do all that with her? She looked down at her phone again. The picture of Mel rubbing sunscreen onto her bare chest was open on the screen. When she had looked at it before she had been focused on herself. Now she looked at Mel. It was difficult to see through the tight swimsuit, but Mel&#39;s nipples were definitely hard. Heather opened up her normal Instagram and found the pictures from that day. One of them was of Mel rubbing sunscreen onto Heather&#39;s shoulders. If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that she was wearing a proper swimsuit instead of a diaper and Mel was rubbing her shoulders and not her chest it would have been a perfect copy. She looked carefully at Mel in the normal picture. There they were, just like in the other one. Mel&#39;s nipples were hard here too. She flipped between the two pictures. Mel&#39;s face was the same in both. There was an odd look in her eye. One of barely concealed lust.<br />
<br />
Heather clicked her phone&#39;s screen off and set it on her desk. She stared at it for several minutes. She was shivering now, and not just because her diaper was rapidly cooling. She didn&#39;t want to deal with this right now. She looked down at her diaper. She could just escape into another scenario, with sexual settings turned completely off. But what would happen when she got bored of the scenario and came back to reality again? She would have to figure this all out sooner or later. She looked at her phone again. As she did the screen lit up and phone began vibrating across the surface of her desk. She caught it as it fell off the edge and looked at who was calling.<br />
<br />
It was Mel.<br />
<br />
Heather swallowed the lump forming in her throat. She had to act natural. Composing herself, she tapped the answer button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mel.&quot; she said with what she hoped was her usual cheeriness.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Sup Heather!&quot; Mel replied, &quot;Where have you been? I&#39;ve been trying to reach you all day but I kept getting an out-of-service message.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Heather said, &quot;I&#39;ve been... busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Busy doing what? What could possibly have kept you from your bestest friend in the whole world? Were you spending the whole day masturbating or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! No! I&#39;ve just been... busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, fine. Keep your secrets. I&#39;m on my way over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Heather asked, shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I&#39;m on my way over. Dad won some tickets to some fancy late-night opera thing in the city so he and mom are going to get a hotel for the rest of the weekend. They&#39;re sending me your way to keep me out of trouble. Apparently they only trust me when I&#39;m around you. They already cleared it with your folks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. No!&quot; Heather was panicking, &quot;I&#39;m not prepared! Give me a minute!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Mel chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ll walk slowly so you have time clean up after your one-woman orgy. See you soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel hung up. Heather was in full panic mode now. She ripped off the diaper and stuffed it into the trash can then pulled the bag out and tied it shut. She grabbed a pair of panties from her hamper so she wouldn&#39;t get pee on a clean pair and pulled on some sweats and a t-shirt. Grabbing the trash bag, she ran out to the side yard and dumped it in before returning to her room again. The box of diapers was still sitting on her bed. She grabbed it and ran to her closet. There was a space on the top shelf that was just big enough. She made sure the label was facing the wall when she set it down and closed the closet door. She looked around frantically and saw the childish clothes she had purchased with the diapers. She grabbed them and buried them at the bottom of her hamper.<br />
<br />
That had to be everything, right? No. Something was off. She sniffed. She still smelled strongly of pee. She ran across the hall to Derek&#39;s room and grabbed a spare packet of baby wipes. Returning to her room, she tore off her sweats and panties again and cleaned herself off as best she could. She buried the panties with the other clothes in her hamper and the sweats followed after when she realized that they had started to stink too. She had just pulled on a clean pair of underwear when her bedroom door burst open and Mel came striding in.<br />
<br />
Heather nearly fainted at the sight of her. At first glance she thought that Mel was wearing her nanny dress from the scenario, but a second look showed her that it was just a normal sundress. She also wasn&#39;t wearing stockings or leather shoes, but her usual loose gym socks and ratty chucks. The bag over her shoulder, though similar to the diaper bag, was just the usual one that Mel used when she was coming over for an extended stay. Mel tossed the bag onto Heather&#39;s bed and gave Heather a confused look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost. Did I interrupt something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel looked down at Heather&#39;s lack of pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather tore open a drawer and pulled out a pair of pajama pants. She nearly fell over as she rushed to get them on. Mel just watched her, amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, I was going to join you, too&quot; Mel pouted. &quot;Well, I guess I still can.&quot;<br />
<br />
To Heather&#39;s horror, Mel began to pull her dress off. As usual, she wasn&#39;t wearing anything under it except a pair of bike shorts. Heather, unable to avoid checking, noticed that just like in the pictures Mel&#39;s nipples were definitely hard. She stared at her bike shorts, wondering if underneath she was wearing ordinary panties, or the rubber ones from the scenario. She didn&#39;t have to wait long to find out as Mel kicked off her shoes and started pulling the shorts down. Under them she wore a rather large pair of cotton panties. To Heather&#39;s eyes they could have been covering anything. As Mel bent over her bag to pull out her own pajamas she caught Heather&#39;s stare out of the corner of her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; She teased, wiggling her hips playfully.<br />
<br />
Heather didn&#39;t know how to react. In a way, Mel was acting the way she always had. Teasing, playing, making rude comments. These were all things that Mel did on a regular basis, but now Heather was questioning the reason behind them. Was Mel just being her usual playful self? Or was she actually flirting and Heather had just never noticed? Mel pulled on a shirt and pants and sat down on Heather&#39;s bed like she always did. She made a big show of removing her socks, wiggling her toes in the air as each one was pulled free. She laughed at Heather&#39;s expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you feeling okay? You don&#39;t seem like your normal self today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I&#39;m fine.&quot; Heather stammered. &quot;I just had a weird day, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? What did you get up to? Come on, dish!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing. I mostly slept.&quot; Heather said truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;So was it a saucy dream then?&quot; Mel grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of, yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then give me the details!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I forgot it when I woke up. I just remember it was strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel looked disappointed. She flopped back and kicked her feet in the air for a moment. Then she sat up again and gave Heather a piercing look.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were asleep all day,&quot; she said with mock accusation, &quot;Then what was going on with your phone? Even if you were just asleep I should have been able to message you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I turned it off. I didn&#39;t want to be disturbed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plausible, plausible.&quot; Mel said airily. &quot;I&#39;m hungry. Does your mom still have those rice cakes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sudden change of subject suited Heather just fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#39;ll go and check. I&#39;ll never understand why you like those things, they taste like cardboard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only to your childish palate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather flinched at the word childish. She knew that Mel knew nothing about the diapers or their ability to create whole other worlds for her to play in, but she was still wary of anyone somehow finding out. She made her way down to the kitchen and found a pack of the rice cakes. She also grabbed a bag of potato chips and a few sodas. She carried her haul back up to her bedroom to find Mel...</p>
