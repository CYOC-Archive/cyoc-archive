<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner was normal, at least as normal as anything could be for Jenny since her life had been turned upside down. They ate hamburgers and watched TV as a family. At 8 p.m. their mother told Jenny and Jamie that they needed to get ready for bed. Jenny started to argue that it was too early for bed, but instead of words a yawn came out of her mouth. She did feel tired, probably a side affect of being 10 years old again.<br />
<br />
As they headed upstairs, Jamie asked, “So, do you want to shower first or should I?”<br />
<br />
Jenny was unsure how long it would take her to wash her new body, and she didn’t want Jamie banging on the bathroom door. “You go first. Let me know when you’re out.”<br />
<br />
Jenny headed back to her room and lay down on her bed. Staring at the ceiling, she mused aloud to herself about her situation.<br />
<br />
“I guess being younger means I need to sleep more,” she said and yawned. “But, having an adult body means I need to take regular showers still--the worst of both worlds. A kid wouldn’t have to shower, and an adult wouldn’t have to go to bed so early.” She sighed. “What a fucking mess.”<br />
<br />
It gave her a little thrill to swear in her sister’s childish voice. It also helped her remember that she wasn’t really a girl with an adult body. She was just stuck that way for a while.<br />
<br />
“I hope Frank calls soon,” she said. She must have dozed off for a little while because the next thing she knew her sister dressed in PJs was nudging her and telling her that it was her turn to shower. As Jenny left her room, she glanced briefly at her Bieber shrine. He grinned back at her from his pictures. Although she hated to admit it, it thrilled her to simply imagine that a hot boy like him could be smiling at her. That she might be naked and wet soon with his smile on her mind only added to the thrill.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Jenny started her normal clean up routine: take a piss, shower, brush teeth, comb hair, etc. Step one was her first reminder of how different things were for her now. She sat down to pee. It felt strange when the stream of piss came from a different hole. When she stood up again and felt piss dripping down her leg, she cursed and grabbed some toilet paper. “Looks like I need to wipe now whenever I pee.” She yawned again and decided to hurry up so she could get to bed soon. Quickly, she took of the rest of her clothes, and started the water for her shower.<br />
<br />
After stepping in, the warm water hit her naked skin and trickled down over all of her new curves. She purred gently as she felt the warmth around her caress her--so comfortable. She felt like she could have stood there for an hour, relishing the feeling of the water flowing over her large breasts and past her new mound below, but she had to remind herself that she was supposed to be cleaning up and getting to bed.<br />
<br />
“Hair first,” she ordered herself. She discovered that needed more shampoo than normal, after she found that the normal amount she would use as Jeff just disappeared into her longer hair. Realizing that Jamie used conditioner on her hair, Jenny did the same. After rinsing, Jenny knew it was time to wash her body.<br />
<br />
She hadn’t consciously touched her new body since earlier in the day when she had tried and failed to convince herself that she didn’t like guys. She still felt a bit weird about being both a hot woman and her sister at the same time, but she couldn’t wash herself without touching herself. “Quit being a chicken shit, and just grab the soap,” she said. She soaped up her face and then her arms, trying to avoid her chest for as long as possible. Her back was next and then her belly.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she went ahead and soaped up her breasts. Between the warmth of the water and the gentle, slippery fondling of her hands, she felt herself getting aroused immediately as she had feared she might. She purred again--Jamie’s voice, yes, but Jamie never made that sound. It was Jenny’s voice now, anyway, her body too. Some residual part of Jeff’s mind in her wanted to stop with the rubbing, knowing all too well where all of this would lead, but she couldn’t help herself. It felt too good. She smiled as she felt herself succumb to her desires.<br />
<br />
One hand kept at her soft breasts while the other hand ran the bar of soap over her crotch. “Oooh, yeah,” she cooed as her crotch radiated waves of pleasure through her whole body. She kept on rubbing and squeezing, all the while, stifling her moans as best as she could. She switched hands and leaned her back against the tiles for support. Her legs had already begun to feel shaky from the stimulation. Now, the soap bar was parting her labia with each rub, as her nipples swelled and stiffened under her slick fingers. She closed her eyes and pictured hands touching her. In her mind, they were his hands. He was there in the shower with her, soaking wet and smiling that smile of his. That smile that he saved just for her, only her. “Yes, more,” she demanded. The fingers spread her open and slid in and out of her. Her hips joined in with the thrusting. She bit her lip to keep from screaming. It was beautiful agony. It was horrible ecstasy. She hated herself and loved every sensation. “More,” she whimpered. “Justin, more!” Those hands went wild: the warmth, the sliding, the squeezing, the rubbing, the thrusting, Justin, Justin, Justin. A lightning bolt of pleasure blasted up through her, and her mind flashed white with joy. She didn’t scream. There were no words or sounds that could express the feeling inside her. It was too big, too wonderful. Her body shuddered a few times and then she slumped down, her back sliding down the wet tiles until her bare ass met the bottom of the tub. The warm stream of water rained down on her as she lay at the bottom of the tub, feeling completely spent and delighting in the white afterglow of her first female orgasm.<br />
<br />
How long she lay there, she couldn’t say, but eventually, she felt her fingers pruning and decided to finish washing her legs and feet. Soon enough, she had finished and was toweling off. As she dried her long hair, her face was locked in a gentle smile. That glow was still with her, but the intensity had dimmed, leaving her feeling just content with the world and everything in it. Some trace of shame nagged at the back of her mind, but she paid it no attention.<br />
<br />
The rest of her time in the bathroom passed by quickly, she figured out how to wrap the towel around her upper body and then brushed her teeth, nothing new in that. She combed out her long hair and then headed for her room. She found a pair of adult pink PJs in her dresser draw very similar to what her sister was wearing. They were flannel and felt amazing on her skin when she put them on. Then, she put away her towel and hopped in bed. Her alarm clock said it was 9:29. It really had been a long shower, she mused. She yawned again, feeling completely spent. Still, she found the energy to pull out her iPod, and slip in her earbuds. Justin started singing to her then. She rolled over and gazed as his shrine. “I love you,” she whispered to his smiling face. Soon enough, she drifted off to sleep and dreamt of him singing to her and her alone.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, Jamie was shaking her awake. “Get up, sleepy head,” her sister said. “Come on! This is the third time I’ve called you. It’s time for school, and we’re not missing the bus again. So, get moving.”<br />
<br />
“I’m up,” she grumbled, feeling half awake and a bit confused.<br />
<br />
Her sister left her room saying, “You better hurry up. We’ve got to go. No time for breakfast.”<br />
<br />
Alone now, Jenny yawned and tried to figure out what was going on. She never rode the same bus with Jamie. What was she talking about? Then, she felt her breasts shift as she sat up, and she remembered what had happened to her yesterday. “Oh, yeah, the Chronivac,” she said and looked down at her cleavage. “I’ve got these to worry about now.” Her hands touched her massive breasts gently. Suddenly, memories of her shower came back to her. She cringed. “God, did I really do that last night? I must have been really tired…” …or really horny, she thought but didn’t say it out loud.<br />
<br />
She stood up and stretched and stretched up some more, way too high. She felt too tall and too young and too old and too curvy and just so very wrong altogether.<br />
<br />
“Come on!” Jamie shouted from down the hall. “Let’s go. Bus is almost here.”<br />
<br />
“Coming,” Jenny shouted back in her identical voice and scrambled to find her clothes. “This is going to be interesting,” she said as she imagined the school day ahead. She found her DD-cup bra and held it up for inspection. She chuckled and then shook her head, smiling. “Fifth grade, here I come.”</p>
