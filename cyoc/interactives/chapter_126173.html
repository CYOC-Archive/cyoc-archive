<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“To be more attractive to the guys. I want to explore this gay thing a bit further before going straight again. You know? Perhaps have some real sex or something”, only blushing a bit. <br />
The genie smirked and nodded. “Your wish shall be granted in the course of the next day. Enjoy!” And vanished back into the lamp<br />
Rick had a grin on his face. The next day would be great, he thought, as he quickly drifted to sleep.<br />
The next day, the only measurable change he found was in his wardrobe, or, to be more precise, in his underwear drawer. All of his comfortable and wide boxer shorts had been replaced by brightly colored slips, even tighter than his water polo speedos. He decided for a baby blue one and went to his first few courses of the day.<br />
He was well into math, as he felt a bit chilly. Looking at his arms, he noticed his flannel shirt had somehow morphed into a tight tank top – black with a bright pink unicorn and the text “Sorry girls…” on it. Looking down, he noticed his jeans had gone through a smiliar transformation: They were really tight and in a bright blue tone matching his underwear. That could be easily seen, as the upper band peeked out of his jeans.<br />
He grinned. This would be fun. It wasn’t exactly the style he had in mind, but hey, he could always undo it if he didn’t like it. <br />
He endured until the end of the course until he practically jumped out of his chair to get outside. However, as he grabbed his backpack, it felt unfamiliarly heavy for some reason. Confused, he checked it out, but couldn’t find anything out of the ordinary – until he saw his arms. He had really skinny arms – all the definition from his water polo training seemed to have vanished all of a sudden, leaving his body skinny and small. He barely noticed his arms were cleanly shaved. What was up with that? He always thought, guys dug muscles (at least he did, he noticed with a twitch in his cock). So what happened to them?<br />
Still in his thoughts, he bumped into someone on his way across campus. It was Marvin, he realized, but something was wrong. He had to look up a bit, as he was now clearly taller than him. No, Rick realized, he had shrunk a bit. He just never noticed, how… hot Marvin was – the defined muscles from the water polo, his body hair… Rick felt his dick getting hard quickly.<br />
“Hey there”, Marvin said. “What’s up?”<br />
“Hey…” Rick stammered as his gaze went down to Marvin’s crotch. God, he felt so horny!<br />
Marvin must have noticed, as he heard a chuckling noise from him. “Hey, my eyes are up here, hotty. Hotty? That was something new, but being called like that sent a shiver down Rick’s spine.<br />
“S-Sorry. I’m just…” He began, but was interrupted by Marvin again. <br />
“Yeah, I can see clearly what you are.” <br />
“How about we continue where we left off yesterday? I know a quiet place behind the building…” Marvin continued, nodding to Rick’s painfully visible erection. He just nodded and followed Marvin around. Once they were out of side, he felt electrified as Marvin slapped his ass (which was quite a bit bigger than yesterday) hard. <br />
“Turn around little bitch” he heard Marvin say and automatically obeyed. This was not how he had imagined it to be, if he was being honest, Rick thought while Marvin roughly removed both of their jeans, but this felt oh so right.<br />
That feeling only intensified as he felt Marvin push his hard cock into him, making him gasp in pleasure. This was a whole new dimension to sex, he decided, as Marvin brought him to orgasm without Rick’s cock having even been touched.<br />
After they were finished, Marvin grinned. “I’m really looking forward to doing that again” and left Rick behind, who was still gathering his senses. He had no idea what he was missing when he was still straight.<br />
The rest of the day was not exactly as spectacular as it had begun, but Rick found himself being looked at with whole different eyes. He appeared to have become even more outgoing, but some people just wouldn’t want to talk to him at all, some even openly hated him. All of that couldn’t really dampen his mood however, until, on the late afternoon, he met Josh.<br />
“Hey there”, the team captain began, clearly having something burden his mind. “I wanted to talk to you for some time now, but I guess now is as good as any time.”<br />
“Sure, what’s up?” Rick said, puzzled.<br />
“There’s no easy way to say that so… I’m sorry, but you’re off the water polo team.”<br />
Rick just blinked and stared at him, confused. It didn’t sound like that yesterday.<br />
“Look, I’m sorry, but this sport requires a certain fitness. And you’re just… not build enough at the end of the day. This has nothing to do with you, and if you had some success in the gym, I’d be really glad to have you on the team again, but…” his voice trailed off.<br />
“Well, that’s what I wanted to tell you. Sorry.” He mumbled, turning to leave before Rick was even finished comprehending what he just heard. So, this new body came with some drawbacks, as it seemed. He needed to fix that, he decided while heading home. Luckily, he still had the magic lamp.<br />
As soon as he arrived, he summoned the genie again, and voiced his wish: “Genie, I wish,…”</p>
