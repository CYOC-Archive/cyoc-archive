<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim Miller was a hard working lawyer and businessman in Montana. He knew hardship through most of his life. He was able to be successful and marry into a wealthy family via his late wife Dianne. His wealth through business was multiplied by his wife&#39;s wealth and he was able to give an amazing life to his Son Chris and his Daughter Gianna. He loved both dearly but wished they would stop fighting so much. Recently the virus has affected his business investments and his employees are hurting too. He wants to be able to fight harder and provide more for his employees because they are like family to him. The past 18 hours have been hell for Jim and he wishes he could be home more with his kids because he knows once the virus is over they are going to be at college and doing internships in New York or wherever there talents takes them and he wants to spend the finite amount he has with them. <br />
<br />
He was coming home after a long day at the office. It was midnight and he was coming home. He was unlocking the door to his mansion and he heard something odd. It was moaning. Jim was starting to get a little furious as he heard what was sex. He had no problem with his kids having sex but the rule was as long as it is in his house he sound not hear it. However, what was getting him even angrier was that they were breaking social distancing guidelines by inviting new people to there house, He was going to explode on who ever of his children were having sex.<br />
<br />
No one could ever prepare him for this. <br />
He saw what appeared to be two versions of his sweet angel Gianna sucking on some weird sex toy from Japan, while both of them were saying &quot;I love you Gianna&quot;<br />
<br />
There was so much for Jim to unpack and then he heard something even more bizarre <br />
&quot;To our late brother Chris&quot; They both said<br />
Wait was Chris dead? Oh dear not another dead family member <br />
Why where there two Gianna?<br />
His head was throbbing he just yelled what the fuck<br />
<br />
Gianna and Gianna heard that and were scared shitless<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi daddy&quot; One of them said <br />
<br />
&quot;I know this looks werid bu-&quot; the other said <br />
<br />
&quot;I AM DONE!!&quot; Jim Snapped he was going to kill everyone <br />
<br />
He ran to the gun safe and got his glock <br />
<br />
The two Gianna saw the gun and had to run<br />
<br />
He was about to shoot then one Gianna used the dildos to strangle their dad Jim <br />
<br />
&quot;Gianna what the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I panicked&quot; She said <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit what are we going to do Gianna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we can use the  Chronivac Version 4.0 &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thinking&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One Gianna ran in haste&quot;<br />
<br />
Gianna quickly typed away on the Chronivac Version 4.0  trying to fix there issue with thier dad. In her haste and with some latent thoughts in her and/or her other self&#39;s mind a big mistake was just made.<br />
<br />
Gianna came down the stairs from the study, <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you fix it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure did sexy thing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love us&quot;<br />
<br />
They kissed <br />
<br />
But then their eyes almost popped out their head when they saw the unthinkable. The big hulk of a 6&#39;5&#39;&#39; man that was their father Jim Miller was rolling around in pain on the floor and his screams were becoming more high pitched. Their fears were confirmed when they saw their dad&#39;s body taking a familiar sexy (yet in this case terrifying to see form) Soon they were greeted with a third Gianna Miller. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why is dad us now?&quot; Gianna asked herself <br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea why&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you do it on purpose&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For all we know you could thought of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Gianna were about to yell and fight a famialr voice joined the room <br />
<br />
&quot;We are all the same person so we were all thinking of it... by the way great tits you two sexy babes&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Gianna were in shock<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you Gianna or dad?&quot; They both asked their new twin    <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Gianna Miller as you two are but I am aware that I used to be our father Jim, Don&#39;t worry I want to stay like this being Gianna Miller is amazing, thank you for doing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOT TO UNPACK&quot; all three Gianna said<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets wear clothes so that we do not feel tempted to fuck each other&quot; All three Gianna said<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed&quot; said all<br />
<br />
All three Gianna deiced that they would wear identical sweatpants but each decided to wear different colored bras and all three of them put their beautiful long hair in a messy bun. <br />
<br />
They then talked it out as a family. They all accessed each others shared memoires and realized the best way to stay a connected family was for all of them to be Gianna and they were all happy with this. <br />
<br />
Then all three Gina let their beautiful flow free and let their hair down at the same time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow that was cool&quot; They said at once <br />
<br />
They then stripped and fucked for hours. They found out by using the memory looping feature they share they can amplify the power of their orgasms by 120000%. After fucking till 4:00 am the three Gianna went to sleep knowing they are a perfect family.</p>
