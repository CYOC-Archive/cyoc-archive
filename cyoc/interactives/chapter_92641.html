<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon went out of the lockers room, and took his time wandering around his high school. He had been going through all those rooms and corridors for years, but now it was completely different. Not only did it feel different in light of his new might, but also his physical appearence caused his schoolmates to see him as someone desirable. He could tell. It was not just that some - most, actually -  women found him sexy. In fact, just about everyone gave out the impression that they were eager to accept him and socially interact with him, if he wished so. This had never happened to Simon in all his life. Not even as a child when, once, he had brought the newest, fanciest, flashiest toy to school. Even then he could see, well, some sort of greedy interest in their minds. Now, it was all genuine, honest interest to include him in high school socialising. It helped, of course, that for the first time in his life, his attire and looks were, by all means, cool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you new around? Because I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you before. I&#39;m Greg by the way&quot;. Just in front of him, one of the most charming and charismatic people in high school was smiling at him, while extending his hand for him to shake.<br />
<br />
Simon knew Greg, of course he did. They had been in the same class in primary school, although, even then, they belonged in different groups. To Simon, Greg was all right. He had never been a jerk to him, he would even make it a point to stop and start some small talk, just to catch up from time to time. But he would never compromise his social position by befriending a loser. There was an enormous distance between showing off the ability to socialise with everyone, and hanging out with the wrong people. Well, as far as Greg was concerned, he had never met the boy he had in front of him, so Simon had the oportunity to make things right this time. He was not worried at all by what others might think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Simon. You&#39;re right, I&#39;m about to transfer here from the Netherlands. I&#39;ve come to get a hold of the place and stuff.&quot; Simon would need to forge some records...<br />
<br />
&quot;The Netherlands? Cool! But you don&#39;t sound Dutch&quot;, said Greg, with a questioning look.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because I&#39;m not Dutch&quot;, Simon said, lightly. &quot;I lived most of my life in Iowa. Whern my parents divorced, three years ago, my father went to live to the Netherlands, and I with him. Now, my mother has settled down here, and I decided to come and live with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s quite a story!&quot;. Greg looked impressed. &quot;Look, now I have to go to class. But when last class is over, some friends and me are going bowling. If you don&#39;t have anything more important, feel free to come with us! It&#39;s the best way to get meeting the people here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! That sounds fun! Count with me, I&#39;ll still be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye, then!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon was amazed. Was it that easy to make friends, to socialise? He knew Greg could be a charming, good guy, if he wanted to, but, still, this had been too much. Maybe, it was his godhood. Maybe he radiated some aura that made ordinary people want to be with him or something. He would have to find out. Suddenly, he was overcome by a feeling of loneliness. He became clearly aware that he was an unique being, that no human could compare to him in any way, that he was now alone for most intents and purposes. Either he would hide his true nature, and then be a secret for common people; or he would reveal his divinity, and asume his superiority over everyone, and then his relation with anyone would be impaired. No, neither was acceptable to Simon.<br />
<br />
As he turned around, he saw the jocks, who he had just punished, getting out of the lockers room. They looked hurt, but they also knew that they still had each other, and that was a lot. Simon could see that. Some jocks were conforting one another, or in small groups, and they did not seem in dispair. At the very least, they could take refuge in their sharers of misfortune. They could do their best to try and win some matches, and feel better out of it. Simon could see that they were reassuring each other that, eventually, they would recover their old lives. &quot;Well&quot;, thought Simon, &quot;you have a long run before that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then, it hit him. He needed a mate. A mate in godhood. Someone he could share his true concerns with. Someone he could trust, absolutely. Someone who he could ask fo advice. Someone who would try to stop his bad decisions, and whose bad decisions Simon would stop. All in all, a peer. But, who could be that person? He thought of Greg, but immediately rejected the idea. He could not trust Greg, at least not yet. What about James, his, well, old Simon&#39;s best friend. He could trust him, that was for sure. But James was a bit of elitist. Simon was not conviced how a mighty James would turn out. Besides, he had friends other that James. Not best friends, but good and honest friends all the same.<br />
<br />
Simon decided to go look for James, and immediately knew he was in the library. As he crossed the door of the library, he got  his old shape back, so as to effectivley communicate with his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, James&quot;, whispered Simon, after stting by his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Simon&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I have something amazing to show you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it this time? A new species of lizard?&quot;. James could be very sarcastic, if he wanted to. He still did not look up from his book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. Just look!&quot;<br />
<br />
As James looked up, Simon made a pencil float a few centimetres over the desk, perform one or two pirouettes on air and the slowly land back on the desk, just in front of James.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Simon could just grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;How the fuck did you do that?!&quot; James was almost shouting. Several people looked up to see what happened, but quickly got back to their homework.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh! Be discrete, for God&#39;s sake! I don&#39;t know the full thing of it, but I was kidnapped by the jocks, they had me all tied up in the lockers room, and then I was sprayed with that deodorant which turned me into a god. That&#39;s pretty much it. Oh! And I used my power to make all the jocks ugly stuttering wimps.&quot;<br />
<br />
James cocked an eyebrow. &quot;You know that what you are saying makes no sense, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait and see&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, Simon got up and, without saying a word, went behind some bookcases and immediately came back, in his new, enhanced shape and sat back by James. His face was struck not by surprise, or amezement, but by his inability to reconcile reality with his knowledge of the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the question is, Mr sceptical, do you want to be sprayed and be like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
James took his time to come back process Simon&#39;s offer, and to answer anything. James decided...</p>
