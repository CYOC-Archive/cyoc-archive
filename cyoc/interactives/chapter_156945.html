<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John swaggered out of his bedroom like a lord surveying his land, it felt good to be king, and boy, was he enjoying it. The house had changed, with the master of the house having his home larger, more modernized to suit a growing man and his &quot;son&quot; and wife to accommodate the spaces necessary. The walls would need to be adjusted, but after all, with a behemoth like himself, he enjoyed being as loud and as dominating as his aura had become. Despite it being his Sunday, John at age 30 had felt like the pinnacle of males in the privacy of his own, now upgraded home. He rubbed the back of his neck, putting both striated arms behind them, his indecency furthered as he sauntered out nonchalantly in the nude as Simon stood slack jawed at the muscle bound Adonis who cockily displayed his proud member for all to see. His face was the picture perfect example of manhood, rugged but handsome features, his beard well trimmed yet enough to seduce even the most prudent of folk, while his milk white teeth had all but confirmed his perfection to the now spaced out Simon, who realized the power the Chronivac had shown him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, sorry about the noise, bro... Look, I know it&#39;s been a while since we both last hung out, but, I&#39;ve been thinking...&quot; He started, pounding his left pec as Simon&#39;s eyes followed the bouncing. &quot;I missed hanging with my fave bro. Me and Kim are together and all, but between the gym, my photoshoots, and the whole advertising, I really wanna kick back with ya.&quot; He smirked, placing his right arm over his &quot;brother&quot; Simon. Simon, still awestruck, politefully coughed and John took the hint, realizing his lack of clothes and chuckled as he grabbed a slate gray towel on the rail nearby and wrapped it around his tight waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell ya what, come down with me and after we get some breakfast, me and my best bro are gonna hit the gym and do some major bro-time. Sound good, man?&quot; John offered, the sheer aura of his manly presence had winded Simon of his senses momentarily. This... Was his father... Er, brother, apparently, as John had regressed and Simon had aged to a point where the difference in age had corrected itself to incorporate a new &quot;bond&quot;. Did that mean that the new feelings sprouting were familial? Were they more? He questioned, feeling hot as John&#39;s musculature had built up impressively and bulged in every direction that made Simon&#39;s body night tremble at the thought of a physique like his caressing him, or the other way around.<br />
<br />
John noticed Simon&#39;s gawking as they came down and chowed down on breakfast, he flexed a brawny arm that nearly encapsulated his entire tank top and chuckled at Simon&#39;s downwards gaze. &quot;S&#39;okay bro, lots of guys envy me at the gym, y&#39;know what I say...!&quot; He grunted, pulling an impressive double bi&#39;s as Simon and he simultaneously shouted,<br />
<br />
&quot;If ya got it, flaunt it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my bro!&quot; John hollered, wrapping his arm once more over Simon&#39;s thinner body and nearly shaking him off the chair. John&#39;s regression had done so splendidly, he hadn&#39;t thought of John&#39;s new interests &quot;rewriting&quot; the &quot;old&quot; John. Did he... Did he remember who he used to be...? As John cleared up the dinner table and took a morning selfie to post on his Instagram page (seemingly everything the Chronivac had thought of and made in advance, including the logo of John&#39;s bodybuilding supplements and his certified page that showed off his bulky, herculean physique and the many collabs he had done prior) Simon furrowed his brows trying to come up with answers before he found himself being taken along to a name branded gym John was ranting about that asked him for an exclusive &quot;workout&quot; video to promote his new success as a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
At the gym, Simon marveled as John easily benched more than he had thought was possible, yelling &quot;LIGHT WEIGHT, BABY BRO!&quot; as he saw Simon&#39;s reaction and heaved 250 lbs on the bench press. Onlookers ooh&#39;ed and ahh&#39;ed as the famous John Sanderson easily made the gym equipment look like children&#39;s toys, one fan nearly even tore off the tank top from his struggling lats as John attempted to claw them from himself, it took John stroking his ego and accepting to sign the tank top and give it away AND an instagram selfie to let the man off him. Despite the show of antics, John had faced them all with a smug smile, all of it was becoming so easy for him... That forgetting his old life was even easier to simply fade away into thin air. Whatever had gone with him was simply just a dream, in the eyes of a man whose entire being and identity was shaped by the Chronivac. Simon&#39;s heart was racing as he saw his father&#39;s... No, brother&#39;s arms pump obscenely on the preacher curls and his beastial grunts as he flexed and grunted for the crowd overlooking their workout. Simon&#39;s physique was by no means anything to scoff at, for sure, but John was at the peak of his game, and at a nigh solid 265 lbs John Sanderson IFBB was a force to be reckoned with both on the bodybuilding scene and in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Simon gulped as he attempted to wash down all the swirling emotions going in his mind in the shower, what else had the Chronivac changed about his father? Was he still the same strict father deep down? Was there any chance of going back? Or was this the new and improved John and was here to stay? Attempting to assuage his fears, Simon quickly finished his shower and pulled out the Chronivac controller from his locker, he could try to fix things if he had just--<br />
<br />
*SLAM*<br />
<br />
The intruding noise jolted Simon from his perch, and in fright of being caught, shut the locker door with his free hand and jumped, towel in the other to hide around the corner from anyone who could see him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man!&quot; John howled, dropping his towel to the ground as he opened his locker and grabbed a jockstrap from the duffel bag hidden within. &quot;Fuckin&#39; perfect workout today... Fuck, I&#39;m still feeling that pump today too,&quot; He flexed his arms, the energy was surging everywhere, and whatever he had, he wanted to use it up. Posing for himself was too easy, and as he slapped his ass just for his show, he realized that his pent up energy was filling up else where vying for attention. But the gym locker room was no place to rub one out, try as he&#39;d like. He&#39;d save it for Kim when she got home and she&#39;d wear the cutest little thing, the darling cougar, smack his ass and pull him close before he-<br />
<br />
John looked down as his foot knocked something gently into view, a controller of sorts, one that could be used on a tv screen. What on earth would such a device be doing on the floor like that? John looked around him, seeing if there was anyone that may have dropped it in sight, but in seeing no one, he sighed, smiling as he picked up the controller and placed it into his gym bag and started getting dressed to leave. Simon was probably already done getting ready, and he didn&#39;t want to disappoint his &#39;lil bro now that he was well on his way to winning the next contest so soon...! Slamming the locker shut and wrestling the tank top over his head, John kicked in his shoes and made his way out of the locker room, before turning to the mirror that called for his attention, smirked, and flexed his mighty arms and exited, chuckling all the way unaware of the prize that laid within his duffel bag.<br />
<br />
Simon revealed himself as he heard the footsteps walking away, he scampered over to his locker, hands trembling as he gripped his towel in apprehension. Getting dressed in a shorts and an active shirt, Simon quickly slammed the locker shut before splashing water on his face as he left the locker room, hoping to wash off any and all matters of anxiety as he continued to worry about the possible circumstances he could have wrought by complete accident. John waited for him at the entrance, waving his large arm at him to meet him as the adoring fans began pestering him for questions and pictures, Simon covered his visage with his hand and was the first to leave, John courteously signing with his hand for the paparazzi and gym goers to leave him and his brother be.<br />
<br />
Later that night, as Simon begged for his worries to end, he tried to collect his thoughts to change things back to a &quot;different&quot; time and perhaps fix what may quickly become a disaster if things were left unchecked. After dinner with John and Kim, Simon raced to his room, hoping to rectify his mistakes with a few changes to the Chornivac, but as he rifled his bag, his heart beat faster as he could not find the controller, his panic reaching a forefront as he went through pairs of socks, underwear, shirts, and shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Where could it be?! I-I couldn&#39;t have lost it, I had it in the locker room!&quot; Simon screamed internally. Had he truly left it at the gym locker room?! His body went cold in fear of being locked in this foreign body and his father... Brother, like that and his mother being... So different and odd. Wrestling on what gear he could, Simon dashed from his room, yelling to whoever could he hear him that he would be back. He had to find the controller, before it was too late!<br />
<br />
While Simon had been out attempting to find the controller, John found himself intrigued by the item he had found in the gym, having gone to his master bedroom not long after dinner with Kim and Simon and leaving his darling wife alone as Kim&#39;s shows debuted in the downstairs tv room, pressed the power button on the controller. Hearing the tv monitor flicker, John&#39;s curiosity grew as the bodybuilder was treated to a modernized display of his name and various stats on the monitor, his height, weight, age, and even &quot;family&quot; relations listed on the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, so this must be some new fitness app...&quot; John mused, flicking towards the stats and reading them up. It had seemed like the perfect fitness application, he could input his age, his weight, and even his family and then make goals for them to achieve! Maybe add in extra workout reps, update his exercises, heck, Lil bro Simon could really pump in a few months if he really applied himself, John thought, as he began to set his own &quot;goals&quot; to gain more muscle and typed &quot;Accomplished IFBB Pro Bodybuilder&quot; on the &quot;Job&quot; statistics. Interestingly, John looked at the family settings and saw confusingly himself labeled as:<br />
---------<br />
John Sanderson: <br />
<br />
Age: 30 (Previous: N/A; Originally: 43)<br />
Weight: 285 lbs. (Previous weights: 265 lbs. 210 lbs.)<br />
Height: 6&#39;4<br />
Family Relationship: Brother (Previous: Father) - Simon Sanderson<br />
Kim Sanderson - Wife<br />
Job Status: Accomplished IFBB Pro Bodybuilder (Previous: Salaryman)<br />
_______________________<br />
<br />
Assuming it must be a bug or a glitch, John went straight to Simon&#39;s profile and saw the same settings that were previously written: John was somehow written as Simon&#39;s father. The thought bubbled in his mind, he could vaguely think about raising Simon and having a very... Different lifestyle, but he attempted to put them away, the call of fatherhood could easily be replaced with the lustful moan of &quot;Daddy...!&quot; and feeling himself grow aroused at being worshipped, John saved his current settings as he unconsciously brought a thick hand to grope his needy nipple. With the gusto of a child who had learned of a secret that could not be revealed, he hid the remote away in a special spot of his: His trophy closet behind his current trophy: The NY Nationals Bodybuilding Pro. Smiling in his reflection, John closed up shop, undressed, and in all naked glory rubbed his throbbing cock as he treaded towards the sound of a running shower that he had left on. Whether there was a dainty older wife... Or a young male paramour, wasn&#39;t known to the newly forged god, but he, nor the occupant if there were any, didn&#39;t mind in the slightest. <br />
<br />
Tonight was a night of triumph, while Simon&#39;s fears had quickly come true with time. <br />
<br />
But this time, the edits weren&#39;t the ones to worry about, it was who changed his settings that was.</p>
