<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harvey put the necklace in a drawer and left it there for several weeks. The prospect <br />
daunted him and it was fair simpler just to forget it existed.<br />
<br />
But then, a week later, he went into work and a co-worker gave him a curious look. She <br />
told him that he'd been let go weeks back. She was sorry but he'd have to leave. His <br />
parents were still away and not answering their phone. Rent was due in a week. <br />
<br />
Back home, he found himself staring at the drawer. At first, he continued to ignore it. But <br />
with nowhere to go he simply sat around the house. And daytime television wasn’t <br />
distracting enough to put it out of his mind. It was another whole day before he worked up <br />
the courage to get it out. And at first he only stood about with it on. Eventually, though, he <br />
found himself standing before the mirror.<br />
<br />
He took one look at his home. It was cluttered, dirty, falling apart. No job, no friends, no <br />
family worth a damn. If he went through with this, he’d never have his life back the way it <br />
was. But would he really miss it? He held the cube between his thumb and finger. It <br />
glowed. He gave it the smallest of shakes.<br />
<br />
He felt a rush of air and nearly lost his balance. The change had taken barely a second. Not <br />
much had changed other than he had grown taller. His clothes no longer fitted him, so his <br />
midriff and ankles were now bare. But he still had the same face, the same basic shape. He <br />
tried again.<br />
<br />
Another rush of air. He was now short and very fat. And on his chin was a layer of stubble <br />
where he’d never been able to grow much hair before. His belt was choking him so he <br />
shook the cube again, a little harder this time.<br />
<br />
He felt a sudden tightness and almighty crack and then nothing. He gasped when he <br />
realised he was naked. He was now a seven foot body-builder. The change had been so <br />
sudden that his clothes had shredded and were now in tatters on the floor. The crack must <br />
have been the elastic in his boxers snapping.<br />
<br />
He examined his new body. His face was the same, though his hair was much shorter. His <br />
skin was lightly tanned and his muscles nicely toned. He found he was able to jiggle his <br />
pecs. And his cock was far bigger than he was familiar with. He could get used to this <br />
body.<br />
<br />
He posed for himself a few times. Then, just to get a feel for it, he began walking around <br />
his house. He lounged naked on his sofa and curled up in his bed, just to see how it felt. <br />
He watched television and stroked his cock gently. It sprung to attention.<br />
<br />
Not caring that it was the middle of the day and anyone walking on the beach would be <br />
able to see him through the window, he began to jerk off. It took him a moment to get <br />
accustomed to the extra length and his firm grip but he managed. As if he were doing it for <br />
the first time, he was a little over-zealous and cum spilled out over his torso far too <br />
quickly. He didn’t mind so much, though. It was still more exciting than he’d had in a <br />
while.<br />
<br />
He went into the bathroom to wipe the cum of his body, finding the towel a little too small <br />
for him. Then he considered going out, testing his new body in public. But as he walked <br />
over to the wardrobe to get dressed, he quickly realised that all of his clothes were now far <br />
too small to fit him.<br />
<br />
He paused for a moment. Perhaps he could go out anyway. It wasn’t as if he was ashamed <br />
of his body now and if anything happened, he’d have the necklace with him.<br />
<br />
Other than that there were only three ways he could leave.<br />
<br />
The first was to keep on changing his body until his clothes fit, in which case he’d be <br />
pretty much the same as he started, so there was no point in that.<br />
<br />
The second was if he changed species, because an animal could go outdoors naked <br />
without a problem.<br />
<br />
The third was if he shook the cube three seconds. The mother load. Completely new life.<br />
<br />
He made up his mind.</p>
