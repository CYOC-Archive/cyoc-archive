<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With their photos plastered all over TVs in Myrtle Beach, Daniella and Tom came to the realization that they would need to change their appearances.<br />
<br />
Tom quickly went into the bathroom, and pulled out an electric razor.  &quot;I&#39;ll do this out here, you can use the bathroom and do whatever you feel you should do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniella took her purse, went into the bathroom and locked the door.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Tom plugged in the razor, and with no hesitation at all,  started the hair shearing process. Tom wasn&#39;t sure how much hair he wanted to cut off, but as he starting the process of buzzing his head, he quickly realized that he wanted all of it gone. Stroke after stroke, buzz after buzz, clumps of hair fell to the floor. In about ten minutes, Tom was done with his hair and felt his newly bald head. He thought he was done, only to realize the photo on the news featured him with his facial hair. &quot;So much for being able to grow a beard,&quot; Tom sighed. Within a couple of minutes, there wasn&#39;t a single hair anywhere on Tom&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
When he went to look into the mirror, Tom was startled. He had a stupid bowl cut for so long, he forgot what his face looked like. Never a very confident person, Tom was stunned to see that he looked...good? The lack of hair exposed his new facial structure and his bright blue eyes. For the first time in his life, Tom liked the way he looked. He started flexing his new bulging biceps, doing as many ridiculous poses as he could think of. He then felt compelled to take his shirt off. Man, he was jacked. Tom looked at his labs and laughed. He had been shoved into so many lockers the last three years; now he was the guy who people would think twice of crossing. Looking at himself more, Tom started to jerk himself off. This was nothing new for him, but it was quite a different experience with his larger cock. Tom laid down on the bed and really started to go to town. Using Daniella as motivation, Tom worked himself harder and harder until his shorts were dripping with cum<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Daniella looked at herself in the mirror. She had always been a beautiful girl, but now she was a gorgeous woman. She took off her jean jacket and admired her new body. Her mother had beautiful curves,  but Daniella felt as if she would never get them. Oh how wrong she was. One of her nicknames in prep school was &quot;pequeno&quot; and now she looked like a damn supermodel. Daniella collected her thoughts and realized time was of the essence. She loved her long, black hair but it was too recognizable, especially where they lived. She found a rubber hand and put her hair in a ponytail up to to her neck. Finding a pair of scissors, Daniella pulled it up to her head. &quot;Here goes nothing.&quot; she sighed. With a couple of snips, fourteen inches of hair fell to the floor. Looking at herself in the mirror, the newly bobbed Daniella gasped. The new haircut framed her face pefectly.<br />
<br />
As Daniella got up to leave the bathroom, she noticed a bottle of hydrogen peroxide near the sink. Daniella had been known as the traditional, conservative Hispanic girl her entire life. Maybe this was a time to reinvent herself. Daniella put her neck to the sink, opened the bottle and poured. As she felt the mixture burning her hair, Daniella closed her eyes and splashed some peroxide on her thick, dark eyebrows and winced. After 20 minutes, she washed her hair and eyebrows, and looked in the mirror. What she was an alien; bleach blonde hair, and bleach blonde eyebrows on dark, olive skin. For reasons unbeknownst to herself, she never felt so confident in her life. She reached into her pants, and felt the compulsion to pleasure herself for the first time in her life.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
As Tom was finished cleaning his shorts off, he saw Daniella step out of the bathroom. The two lovers could barely keep themselves from screaming. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god&quot; they said to each other in unison. Daniella ran her hands all over Tom&#39;s chest. &quot;I never thought I would have a thing for Mr. Clean, but you pull it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked back at Daniella. He had never been so turned on by her in his life. &quot;I&#39;m dating a damn supermodel.&quot; He embraced his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniella, you are stunning.&quot; Tom said<br />
&quot;Tom, you are immaculate,&quot; Daniella replied. &quot;I think this was a blessing in disguise...letting go of our old looks. I&#39;m no longer the cute Hispanic tween.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a dweeb with a bowlcut&quot; Tom laughed.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re new people,&quot; Daniella remarked. &quot;I&#39;m not Daniella anymore...I&#39;m Dani.&quot;<br />
Tom was taken aback but smiled. &quot;I&#39;m not Tom. I&#39;m Thomas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani and Thomas started kissing. After a couple of moments, they looked at the bed then each other hesitantly. They had never had sex with each other before, but they figured this may be the only time they would ever get the chance. &quot;Do you want to do this Dani?&quot; Thomas asked. &quot;I do,&quot; Dani replied.<br />
<br />
The couple got undressed quickly and jumped on the bed. With Thomas on top, he started thrusting himself slowly into Dani, not wanting to fuck this up As they got more comfortable, Thomas&#39;s thrusts became faster and faster. He felt himself get harder and harder. Sweat poured down their bodies. Dani had never felt anything like this in her life. She started moaning louder and louder, tightly gripping the sheets with one hand and Thomas&#39; body with the other as she got further aroused. The bed started to shake as the two got louder and louder. Barely holding himself, Thomas thrust forward once more, and let himself go, ejaculating all over Dani&#39;s body. At that point, Dani reached climax and let go, collapsing onto the bed. Thomas, exhausted, look at Dani and simply said &quot;wow.&quot; Licking cum off her lips, Dani smiled. &quot;I love you Thomas.&quot;</p>
