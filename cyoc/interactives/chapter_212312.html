<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day was another school day at Stokerville Public High School. As usual, Stella Bentley proudly strutted through the hall flanked by Ashlee Kline and Zoey Guthrie, her best friends and loyal minions. Dozens of pairs of eyes were locked enviously on the gorgeous rich girl&#39;s every move. To all the onlookers, Stella seemed to be the perfect queen of Stokerville High: regal, elegant, fierce, and (above all else) confident.<br />
<br />
Stella had never felt less confident in her life, however. For one thing, she never <i>truly</i> felt confident if she couldn&#39;t feel a cock bunched up in her bulging panties. She&#39;d only ever felt genuinely confident that one time she secretly went to school with a banana hidden inside her underwear. It had been such a relief that her mother hadn&#39;t seen her slipping the offending fruit in or taking it back out when she&#39;d gotten home.<br />
<br />
But that was only one time about two months ago. Stella&#39;d gotten somewhat used to going to school without the cock she knew her body was supposed to have. No, the main reason the Bitch Queen didn&#39;t feel like the apex predator today was because of last night&#39;s dream. Even just remembering it now, Stella&#39;s mouth went dry at the thought of the tall, buff girl who sort of looked like Hannah Dershowitz pinning her to the ground and fucking her before turning into a weretiger. Dream Hannah had given Stella the best orgasm in her life... and she&#39;d invited Stella to a sleepover that night at Coach Mitchell-Erickson&#39;s house and find some girl called Selena. If she did, Dream Hannah said, Stella could become a weretiger like her.<br />
<br />
Stella had considered going, but sneaking out of the mansion and going to a teacher&#39;s home along at night had seemed like a really bad idea. What if Stella&#39;s mother caught her coming or going? What if Amber turned out to be a creeper? What if there was no Selena at the house and Amber thought Stella was up to something? Stella had convinced herself that the whole thing was just a weird dream that didn&#39;t mean anything and gone back to sleep.<br />
<br />
But what if Dream Hannah had told her the truth? What if there really <i>had</i> been a chance for Stella to transform herself into a weretiger? She&#39;d blown it! She&#39;d let it pass her by! Stella was terrified that she&#39;d sacrificed her destiny and her one chance at genuine happiness. She tried to shrug off that fear and get on with her life as unquestioned ruler of the school, but it was difficult. Stella began to wish she&#39;d thought to slip another banana into her panties before leaving. It wouldn&#39;t be a <i>real</i> cock like Dream Hannah had, but it&#39;d at least be something. She&#39;d at least have been able to run her fingers over her panties in the changing room after cheer practice and feel a nice, big bulge. Her panties were so frustratingly smooth right now...<br />
<br />
Stella&#39;s reverie was interrupted when Hannah—the <i>real</i> Hannah Dershowitz—came running up to her. The Jewish girl was the same scrawny, flat-chested, freckly nerd with over-sized glasses and frizzy ginger hair that she&#39;d always been, not the hulking wild amazon shapeshifter that Dream Hannah had been. Rather than naked, <i>this</i> Hannah was dressed in a hideous, over-sized orange sweater that looked like it belonged to Velma from <i>Scooby-Doo</i>, a threadbare plaid skirt that would have looked more at home in a stuffy private school, long stockings, and a pair of Mary Janes. The tiny nerd was struggling with an overstuffed backpack that threatened to topple the petite ginger&#39;s dainty body. The effect was rather cute, but Stella forced herself not to smile. There was no way she was letting that dork know she liked her. It could destroy Stella&#39;s whole image!<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Dershowitz?&quot; Stella asked, forcing her face into an imperious scowl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have your homework,&quot; Hannah said as she caught her breath. She opened the backpack and fumbled around inside it until she located her crush&#39;s homework. &quot;I did it all. You&#39;ll get an A+, I swear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella accepted the papers and looked them over. &quot;Very good, Dershowitz. And I hope you did Ashlee&#39;s and Zoey&#39;s work, too. You know Ashlee can&#39;t score above a D- when she does her own homework. You want <i>my best friend</i> to graduate, right?&quot; She spat out the words like a threat. Hannah worked best when terrified, and terrifying the adorable girl was fun... and yet there was a part of Stella that wished that Hannah would terrify <i>her</i> instead. How weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Hannah gulped, her skinny knees knocking together. Stella would&#39;ve felt bad if she didn&#39;t know that Hannah secretly enjoyed being intimidated. That time Hannah had accidentally given Stella part of her secret hentai stash along with the homework last year had been... enlightening. Since then, Stella had made a point of being <i>twice</i> as threatening as before. (If only Hannah could turn the tables on her once in a while!)<br />
<br />
Stella forcefully grabbed onto Hannah&#39;s slight shoulders and squeezed down hard, digging her nails in. &quot;Are you <i>sure</i> you took your time, Dershowitz, because I can send the boys from the football team to snap your scrawny body like a twig if you&#39;re shortchanging us! The teachers have been real impressed by how much &#39;our&#39; grades have gone up lately, and I expect you to <i>keep</i> them up, nerd!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D-don&#39;t w-worry, St-Stella,&quot; Hannah stammered. &quot;I w-was up until five in the m-morning finishing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s awfully late,&quot; Zoey remarked as she checked her Instagram account, &quot;even considering that you had to do our homework for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella&#39;s eyebrows raised at Zoey&#39;s remark. She suddenly remembered the midnight gathering at Coach Mitchell-Erickson&#39;s house that Dream Hannah had told her about.<br />
<br />
Before Stella could say anything, Hannah suddenly piped up. &quot;H-hey, c-can I... ask you something? Okay, don&#39;t laugh. I&#39;ll die of shame if you laugh! I was thinking about... auditioning for the cheer squad. Is that... okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella burst out laughing at the thought of dorky little Hannah as a cheerleader, causing the ginger to bury her horrified face in her hands. But then Stella stopped laughing as she thought about it. Hannah may not be popular or conventionally pretty, but she <i>did</i> have a lean dancer&#39;s body. If she could be trained to improve her physical coordination, she could be capable of some incredible stunts. Also, Stella would never admit it out loud, but she&#39;d enjoy having the cute little nerd prancing around her in a sexy cheerleading uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; Stella said at last. &quot;It might be worth a shot. No, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this either, if you&#39;re asking. You can come to the gym for tryouts after school lets out. Ashlee&#39;ll be conducting the auditions. But let me make something very clear.&quot; She grabbed Hannah by the chin. &quot;Ashlee may be the squad captain, but this is <i>my</i> cheer squad. I just let Ashlee be its face because she has the sweetest smile and the most energy. She doesn&#39;t make a single decision without asking me. You will <i>do as I fucking say</i> if you make the squad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah nodded excitedly. &quot;I promise! Taking your orders is what I do best!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then here&#39;s my first order, Dershowitz,&quot; Stella said, her mind returning to her previous thought at last. &quot;What fucking else were you doing last night?! I don&#39;t want you keeping secrets from me... not now, and not when your one of my cheerleaders.&quot; She narrowed her eyes menacingly at the frightened nerd.<br />
<br />
Hannah suddenly became very interested in her Mary Janes. &quot;I... I can&#39;t tell you, Stella.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer me, freak!&quot; Stella roared, Slapping Hannah hard across her face. That always got results. Stella once thought it was because Hannah was afraid that Stella would slap her again if she didn&#39;t listen. Now Stella understood that it was because Hannah was actually <i>grateful</i> for the slap and trying to reward her. Kinky little weirdo... not that Stella wasn&#39;t one herself.<br />
<br />
This time, however, Hannah sadly shook her head as she caressed the red mark on her cheek. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Stella, but I <i>can&#39;t</i>. I wish I could. You&#39;re the most amazing girl in the world, and I freaking <i>treasure</i> every second that I&#39;m around you, but some of my friends are depending on me to keep this secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella decided to take a crazy chance. &quot;But you can trust me! I... I had a dream about you last night.&quot; She put a hand to her forehead. &quot;Shit! That actually sounded like some creepy dude&#39;s pickup line! But seriously, I really did. I was running naked in a forest, and I saw you, only, only you didn&#39;t look like you. You were tall and muscular, and your hair wasn&#39;t as frizzy and you didn&#39;t have glasses anymore. And you had a fucking cock! A cock! Then you pounced on me and fucked me... and you turned into this furry tiger-girl while you did! And then you said that you were you from the future and that I could look like you if I went to Coach Mitchell-Erickson&#39;s house and asked for a girl named Selena.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you... you wanted to be like the weretiger me?&quot; Hannah gasped, her mind swimming with sexual fantasies of her beautiful Stella as a terrifying, majestic hulk of a weretiger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... yeah?&quot; Stella slowly nodded, her face turning beet-red as she admitted her secrets. &quot;Seriously, you were sexy... uh, I mean... the weretiger from the dream was sexy... and she was you... ugh, shit!&quot; Stella banged her blonde head against a locker door in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be embarrassed, Stella,&quot; Hannah said, putting a kind hand on Stella&#39;s arm. &quot;It wrecks your air of menace. You aren&#39;t scary at all like this.&quot; The ginger sounded disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Hannah,&quot; Stella sighed, &quot;but I feel more scared than scary right now. I&#39;m just not used to admitting all my vulnerabilities to someone I&#39;m supposed to be grinding beneath my high heels.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gonna tell Hannah about you being, like, non-Bidenary, Stella?&quot; asked Ashlee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Non-<i>binary</i>, idiot,&quot; Stella sighed, rolling her eyes at her minion&#39;s limited vocabulary. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m non-binary, leaning female. I love my titties, but I want a huge cock, too. The gender dysphoria&#39;s a bitch, and my awful mom would never buy me a packer in a million years. It fucking sucks sometimes.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s really brave of you to tell me,&quot; Hannah said, smiling encouragingly. &quot;What&#39;s your chosen name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still thinking about it,&quot; Stella answered. &quot;I&#39;m favoring Skyler right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice name,&quot; Hannah said. &quot;What are your real pronouns?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still working that out, too,&quot; Stella shrugged. &quot;Maybe they/her? Don&#39;t start using them yet. I&#39;m not ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Hannah smiled softly. &quot;It&#39;s all true, by the way. My friend Selena really is a weretiger, and so is her friend Jezebel (who&#39;s also a succubus, incidentally). She was born a human into an all-werewolf family and was bullied like crazy. So she went and bought something called the Were-Brush from a witch. If she brushes an animal and then someone&#39;s hair on the night of the full moon, that person becomes a werebeast version of that animal. The best part? Because they brushed a <i>male</i> tiger at the zoo, Selena and Jez got dicks! She&#39;s going to brush me, Abbie, Chloe, Naomi, Charlee, Pradha, Coach Mitchell-Erickson, and Coach Mitchell-Erickson&#39;s wife Brittany on the night of the next full moon and initiate us into her streak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Streak?&quot; Ashlee asked, perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s a group of tigers,&quot; Zoey suggested. &quot;You know, kinda like a pack of wolves or a pride of lions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Hannah nodded. &quot;You&#39;re all invited to come and join if you like.&quot; Hannah blushed. &quot;I especially hope that... that <i>you</i> want to join, Stella. I... I love you.&quot; Before she could stop herself, Hannah leaned in and greedily kissed Stella&#39;s jaw. Once she realized what she&#39;d done, Hannah tore her lips away from Stella and blushed even redder, hiding her freckly face in her hands. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Stella! You probably hate me now! I... I shouldn&#39;t have said or done ANY of that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella playfully ruffled Hannah&#39;s frizzy ginger curls. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever say shit like that, cutie. Maybe I feel the same way as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Hannah gasped, looking up from her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Stella nodded, a warm smile on her lips. &quot;You&#39;ve got an adorable personality, you&#39;re the smartest girl I know, your tiny body&#39;s adorable... and you&#39;re really fun to scare.&quot; Stella flashed Hannah a sinister grin before giggling. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for us to be weretigers together. Who knows? Maybe you&#39;ll be able to scare <i>me</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella couldn&#39;t believe it. She&#39;d just confessed everything to Hannah Dershowitz. Stella had fumbled her way through it all and came out looking like an idiot, but Hannah now knew that Stella loved her. And what a secret <i>Hannah</i> had! The dream was true! The two of them would be weretigers together when the next full moon rose! Until then, Stella was content to simply have Hannah as her girlfriend. She was a little worried about what dating Hannah would do to her status as the most popular girl in school, but popularity was nothing compared to how the cute little ginger made her feel.</p>
