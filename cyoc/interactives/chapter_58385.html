<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This just wont do! Dallas growls at Horst.<br />
<br />
Well I will try.<br />
<br />
Don't try do it and do it now!!!<br />
<br />
Horst did his little machinations and soon a change was happening.<br />
<br />
When Dallas felt Carter flutter from his grasp he thought maybe Carter <br />
was becoming a person again but then he realized he was the one that <br />
was becoming a shell of his former self.<br />
<br />
What the hell have you done to me!?!?<br />
<br />
I told you these things don't always work the way I want them to and <br />
you insisted that I do it.<br />
<br />
Dallas felt himself drop to the floor and Horst picked him up and put <br />
him neatly into a nice gift box. He put a nice red ribbon on it and <br />
put a note on it.<br />
<br />
He set the package on the garbage cans as he left Dallas' place and <br />
watched as the trash man came down the street. He picked up the box <br />
and read the note on top. Merry Christmas. Here is a nice costume for <br />
you. I think you will like it.<br />
<br />
The Trash man looked at it quizzically and tossed it into the seat <br />
next to him and headed off on the rest of his rounds.<br />
<br />
When he got home he opened the box and pulled the Dallas suit out he <br />
held it up to himself and looked at it.<br />
<br />
There is no way this is ever going to fit.<br />
<br />
He looked for a zipper or buttons or some way to open this up. Then it <br />
came to him that he should start at what should be the suit's butt and <br />
pull it over his head.<br />
<br />
Well here goes I am just going to rip this thing to shreds. But he so <br />
wanted to try. Something about the suit made anyone that owned it want <br />
to try it on.<br />
<br />
<br />
As he tugged and pulled it went over his head. He lifted his arms into <br />
the crevasse and one by one they went inside and down the arms.<br />
<br />
The Trash man had pulled his body yup into the suit and stretched it <br />
as tight as possible when he noticed the dangling legs. He sat down on <br />
his lazy boy and lifted one leg and stuffed it in the ass crack and <br />
down one leg and then did the other. When he got himself snuggly <br />
inside of Dallas he pulled the hood up over his head and noticed that <br />
he was now looking out Dallas' eyes and his mouth was where Dallas' <br />
mouth was. It gave him a nice look but the face was rounded and as he <br />
felt around for his dick to work it into the flap for that he noticed <br />
that there were some things along the belly that looked almost like <br />
the fabric was going to tear. The looked somewhat like stretch marks <br />
but that couldn't happen. He had these wild thoughts going through his <br />
head and he didn't know where that was coming from.<br />
<br />
He heard a screaming in his head and a horniness in his groin that he <br />
hadn't felt since he was young.<br />
<br />
The Trash man was as straight as he could be but he had some wild <br />
fantasies building in him that he had never considered before.<br />
<br />
This new suit didn't have a bit of hair on it's body except on his <br />
head and his crotch. This wasn't like him. He had a full pelt since he <br />
was 13 and this was an interesting feeling for him.<br />
<br />
As he sat there drinking beer after beer Dallas could feel the <br />
fullness in the Trash man's bladder needing to be drained. Dallas <br />
screamed at him to release the pressure because it wasn't just the <br />
trash man that was feeling it and holding it in it was Dallas.<br />
<br />
Dallas decided he was going to go out tonight and hopped into the <br />
shower with the Dallas suit on. As he washed Dallas down he started to <br />
crawl out of it and left it on the shower floor as he washed off all <br />
that grime from the day's work. When he was finished he picked up <br />
Dallas and put the ass crack on the shower head and squirted several <br />
squirts of shampoo in and turned on the shower. Dallas filled and the <br />
stretching was noticeable as the foamy water started to come out <br />
Dallas' mouth.<br />
<br />
When the trash man was dry he pulled Dallas off the shower head and <br />
stuck the hair drier up his ass and let it blow till all water was out <br />
of the inside.<br />
<br />
As he pulled Dallas on this time it was a lot easier it seemed as <br />
though he was a lot looser now. And went on a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Those thoughts seemed to be fading or were they just integrating into <br />
him. He got dressed up and headed out to the sports bar he usually <br />
goes to to pic up some chicks.<br />
<br />
As he was heading down he turned off onto a street he had never gone <br />
down. Not as a trash man and not as a cruising man.<br />
<br />
As he pulled up to the bar he noticed a large rainbow flag flying over <br />
the entrance. He had never been into a gay bar before. He was much too <br />
macho for that but a strange feeling came over him and he decided what <br />
the fuck he was going in.<br />
<br />
This body was like sugar to flys. As he waddled in to the bar the <br />
doorman hit on him taking a particularly long look at his ID. Then as <br />
he went to the bar and ordered a pitcher of beer and started chugging <br />
it down. One down and he was soon on his third when he leaned up <br />
against bar his belly projecting out. He had no end of guys coming <br />
along and giving the budda belly a rub.<br />
<br />
As he waddled around the bar he found a little leather shop and tried <br />
on a harness that fit barely and really showed off his smooth body and <br />
a nice pair of tight leather shorts. He put the clothes he came in <br />
with in a bag and headed out in his new attire and started cruising <br />
the men. He had left his dress up clothes in the shop and left them <br />
there when he left with a nice muscle man for the night.<br />
<br />
Tony found a nice dominant man rippling with muscles and in the Dallas <br />
suit he was really very submissive I guess that was one of the side <br />
effects of the change to Dallas.<br />
<br />
As he went off with the Muscle man he left his trash man life and <br />
became the muscle man's slave and a horny filthy pig he was. He showed <br />
the muscle man how he looks in and outside of the suit and the psychic <br />
link between the trash man and Dallas continued even when not inside <br />
Dallas.</p>
