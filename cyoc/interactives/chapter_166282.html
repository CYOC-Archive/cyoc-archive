<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Unfortunately I have some bad news for you Ms. Mitchell. It appears as though your aging has stopped&quot; he informed the two of them with a sympathetic look.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mouth dropped open at the news, her worse fears having been realized in an instant.<br />
<br />
Gideon immediately got to his feet and confronted the doctor. &quot;Hold on...there has to be some sort of mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man in the white coat sighed, &quot;I&#39;m afraid there isn&#39;t, I&#39;ve kept careful track of Ms. Mitchell&#39;s growth since you first brought her in and there hasn&#39;t been any&quot; he replied hating the fact he had to deliver bad news to one of his patients. &quot;I&#39;ve already apprised ReGenesis of the situation. If you&#39;ll both wait here, they&#39;re sending someone over to explain everything to you as well as what&#39;s going to happen next.&quot;<br />
<br />
And after telling them that the doctor promptly left the room.<br />
<br />
Jen sat there in silence for a full five seconds before she let out her anger in the form of a loud scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no! This wasn&#39;t suppose to happen. My regression was supposed to be temporary...Temporary!...Not permanent&quot; she yelled out.<br />
<br />
Unable to control her emotions Jen then proceeded to throw her first ever temper tantrum, swinging her arms and kicking her legs wildly as she vented her frustration at the unfairness of it all. She was so distraught that she even started crying, tearing streaming down her face as she mourned her lost adulthood.<br />
<br />
Gideon quickly came to her immediate rescue, scooping up the black toddler girl before her violent fit caused her to fall off the table. Holding her over his shoulder he gently patted her back while bouncing her up and down. &quot;There, there Jen. It&#39;s going to be alright. You&#39;ll get through this&quot; he told her despite mentally freaking out himself at the fact that his client was going to be a baby forever. Gideon retrieved the pacifier that he usually kept on hand for whenever Jen got really fussy and popped it into the girl&#39;s mouth, effectively silencing her. He was worried that she&#39;d spit it out but thankfully she kept it in, sucking on the rubber nipple as it soothed her infantile rage. Once she had calm down enough Gideon removed the pacifier and Jen had her thumb quickly take its place.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later a lawyer in a suit and briefcase who represented ReGenesis showed up. The man basically told them what Derrick had already told her but in a longer fashion. That because she had regressed herself so many times in a such a short period she was susceptible to a rare occurrence, what they were now dubbing &quot;age lock&quot;. And how they couldn&#39;t simply age her back up because the problem was caused by a age changing procedure and doing another could make things even worse. They did mention however that they could undo and reverse the race change, or do any of their other procedures so long as it didn&#39;t involve altering her age. Throughout the whole conversation Jen kept her thumb in her mouth as she was afraid that if she took it out she would start crying again, instead nodding whenever she was asked a question.<br />
<br />
At the end of his speech the lawyer produced a contract for her to sign, that stated she would be financially taken care of forever so long as she didn&#39;t hold ReGenesis responsible for the permanent regression. Knowing that she had little choice in the matter, the only other option being to try and sue the company which was impossible, Jen signed her name.<br />
<br />
On the way home Gideon tried to make light of the situation by saying that at least she didn&#39;t have to worry about money any more. However Jen continued to sulk and did so for the rest of the day, being completely submissive to the adult when he fed, bathed and even when he changed her.<br />
<br />
Despite her depressed state Gideon managed to convince her to go to shooting the very next day, thinking that maybe acting would help break her out of it. Jen only agreed, figuring she might as well do it as this part was the only good thing she had left.<br />
<br />
After giving a somewhat decent performance Jen found herself sitting in the playpen during lunch with Derrick, who as usual was dressed in his t-shirt and diaper. Currently the toddler boy sitting down on his padded behind and sucking on a baby bottle full of apple juice, much to delight and amusement of two female stage hands who cooed down at him for drinking his &#39;baba&#39; like a good boy. The two girls ended up leaving after he finished his bottle and let out a cute burp, Derrick smiling as they walked away. The three year old then proceeded to lay down on his back and rest his head against a giant stuffed teddy bear, using it like a pillow as he lounged.<br />
<br />
At that moment Jen was envious of Derrick, not only for being happy with his endless babyhood but for also making being a toddler look so easy. Even the way he used his padding was reminiscent of one as earlier the director fed him a laxative for a specific scene in which he had to poop his diaper and then get it changed on camera by the characters.<br />
<br />
Derrick waited for it to take effect, then toddled across the set and without batting an eye filled the back of his garment with a hefty mess. Though he didn&#39;t need to stop or squat down to do it, it was just one moment the seat was empty then the next it had a noticeable sagging bulge. The characters didn&#39;t acknowledge the toddler&#39;s accident until they could smell it at which point they laid him down and disposed of the dirty diaper, with him kicking and squirming just the right amount during the change.<br />
<br />
Remembering how she had already planned on embracing and acting her new age anyway, and wanting the same level of carefreeness as Derrick Jen decided to...</p>
