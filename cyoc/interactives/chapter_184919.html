<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric was out at his buddy Josh’s place for a day of video games, crowding the couch and intermittently stuffing their faces with pizza, chips, and popcorn. All in all, very satisfying, especially since Eric had wiped the floor with him in Mario Kart.<br />
<br />
Josh threw the controller aside and huffed in annoyance. “You know, you’re surprisingly ruthless playing as Bowser. Why don’t you give the little guy a break here,” he gestured to his character, Toad, barely squeaking behind the hulking turtle who dominated in first. Then, as if to give credence to his words, the after-victory lap had the two in-game figures crash into each other, causing Toad to veer off the road entirely, while Bowser had his arms up in boastful pride.<br />
<br />
Eric preened as he manspread, throwing his legs wide and basked in the attention. “it’s not my fault, man, if you got the size, you might as well use it to your advantage.” <br />
<br />
Josh rolled his eyes with a snarky smile before his gaze innocently followed his friend’s right leg over to his crotch. He blinked his eyes as if trying to clear them. Then he rubbed at them and blinked them some more.<br />
<br />
Eric had an innocent-looking smile on his face as he shifted slightly to make his package stand out even better. “What’s the matter, Josh? You got something in your eye?”<br />
<br />
Josh had one eyebrow raised as he explained with deliberation, “dude, I’ve known you since we were in elementary school. We’ve been changing together in the locker room for two years. When the heck did THAT happen?” He gestured to the bulge.<br />
<br />
Eric snickered as he adjusted himself. Now that his dick knew it was the center of attention, it proceeded to throb and reach its full size. Little Josh’s eyes widened in proportion to the cock’s growth. “I don’t know what you mean. It’s just puberty, I guess.”<br />
<br />
Josh bounced up and down on the couch with indignant energy, “I call bullshit! I have an older brother; I know how long it took him to start growing down there. It doesn’t just happen like that,” he emphasized with a snap of his fingers.<br />
<br />
Eric gave his package an affectionate rub before directing his attention at his friend, who watched the spectacle with undisguised curiosity. “Well, it happened to me.”<br />
<br />
“Prove it!” Josh crowed, “and put your money where your mouth is. I bet you still have the same old same old down there. That,” he pointed at Eric’s underwear, “is probably a clown balloon you have stuffed in your pants. And you shifting it around is making the air move.” Josh snickered with a teasing grin, “better be careful that you don’t sit on it too hard and stretch it too thin, wouldn’t want to burst something,” he fell over laughing.<br />
<br />
Eric raised an eyebrow and went to his button and zip and promptly popped it open and pulled it down. Josh instantly shut up as his gaze followed his friend’s fingers slipping down the fly of the jeans. When Eric pulled his hands away, both of them gawked at the impressive package for very different reasons.<br />
<br />
Eric poked at the eight-inch dick that throbbed at being the center of attention. He couldn’t help noticing that the pale cream complexion of the dick, which previously matched Ethan’s skin, had darkened to match Eric’s instead. And even more mindboggling, the pubes. Eric knew that the pubes were blonde; they had to be; Ethan had blonde hair everywhere. And yet, Eric also couldn’t deny that they were now black, just like the hair on HIS head.<br />
<br />
In unison, the two boys said, “that’s not right.”<br />
<br />
Josh boomed with teenage enthusiasm, “I’ll say, jeez man, what the heck? You could be a porn star with a dick like that. You’re only thirteen. How big will you get when you actually start puberty?”<br />
<br />
Eric sneered, “I DID start puberty already, asshole.”<br />
<br />
“Clearly,” Josh agreed in a shocked voice.<br />
<br />
“No, I mean, I already started getting hair on my chin and the BO earlier this year….”<br />
<br />
Josh clonked himself on the head in exasperation, “dude, that’s small change compared to THAT. That’s puberty. So, what’s your secret?”<br />
Eric looked alarmed as his eyes shifted left to right; Josh could practically see the gears turning in the guy&#39;s head. Eric rubbed the back of his neck as he explained with slow deliberation, “uhm, I kind of swapped with my bro.”<br />
<br />
Josh froze as his brain slowly processed the words, “wait, you mean that,” he pointed at the impressive dick, “is your…” the words dangled with unfinished potential.<br />
<br />
Eric interrupted him, “it WAS,” he emphasized as he gave it an affectionate pat.<br />
<br />
Josh shook his head in disbelief, “dude, Ethan’s a blonde; look at those pubes; they’re as black as the hair on your head. And the skin tone, no offense, but Ethan burns in the summer every year because he’s so pale. That thing is as dark as the rest of you.”<br />
<br />
Eric threw his head back in frustration, “I know that, but it’s not supposed to be! At least it didn’t start that way.”<br />
<br />
Josh held up his palms in surrender, “okay, okay, I believe you. So how did this all happen?”<br />
<br />
Eric went on to discuss the ring and the last two weeks of swapping shenanigans. Once caught up, Josh shook his head in disbelief, “man, you lucked out, big time. My bro would NEVER have let me borrow his dick for even a second. But I wouldn’t get attached to it, Eric. He’s going to want it back sooner rather than later.”<br />
<br />
Eric awkwardly chuckled as he rubbed the back of his neck, “let’s just say I think the possibility of that happening is not very likely.”<br />
Eric then explained how the ring worked and how it required an unconscious desire for the change to occur.<br />
<br />
Josh rolled his eyes, “look, dude, I can understand why YOU would want to keep that thing in your pants, but as soon as your bro makes up his mind, he’s going to want it back. I mean, who wouldn’t?” The silence grew into a relatively long and noticeable silence. Finally, Josh’s eyes bugged out, “but he has YOUR dick, why the hell would he want…” he noticed Eric’s tightening leer. Josh backpedaled as he explained, “I mean, it’s a nice dick, I guess, for a middle-schooler, but damn Eric, he’s almost 18. That thing is downright puny for him.”<br />
<br />
Eric sighed, “I don’t know, Josh. But I’m not looking a gift horse in the mouth. We tried swapping back, and neither of us could make it happen. I didn’t think anything of it, but these changes,” he waved his hand across his dick. “This didn’t happen before.”<br />
<br />
Josh rubbed his smooth chin as he considered his thoughts before concluding, “these new changes didn’t start happening until you both lost the ability to swap back, right?” Eric nodded his head, which prompted the other boy to continue. “It’s like you both decided somewhere in the back of your mind that you had the right package for you. Now, it’s like your new dick is trying to better integrate with you. Kind of weird, but cool,” he considered with the detached interest of a scientist studying a new bug under a microscope.<br />
<br />
“Dude!” Eric exploded, “this is NOT cool. This was my brother’s cock. I can’t just have it start changing to fit me.”<br />
<br />
Josh shrugged his shoulders, “are you willing to give it back?”<br />
<br />
Eric froze as he considered the prospect. His thick dick immediately started going soft, taking the wind out of his horny sails. He loved his brother, and yet… he loved his dick too. It was HIS now, goddamnit. Ethan could have just as easily swapped them back if he really wanted to. And the fact he couldn’t spoke volumes. “No,” Eric quietly but firmly declared, which caused his dick to go rock hard.<br />
<br />
Josh smiled with boyish enthusiasm, “Then there’s your answer. Let your older bro figure himself out because you’re rocking what you got there. You know what you want, and you like that,” he emphasized with a look of deep interest.<br />
<br />
Eric smirked as he leaned in closer to Josh and whispered, “ Josh, by any chance, do YOU want to play around with it?”<br />
Josh blushed as he looked down at the throbbing, manly-looking dick jutting out of his best friend’s crotch. He visibly swallowed, his tiny adam’s apple bobbing place. “I mean… yes,” he whispered in an embarrassed voice as he blushed and kept looking down.<br />
<br />
Eric leaned back and spread his legs wide again, fully exposing himself. “Look, I don’t really care for guys like that, but I’m flattered. And I don’t mind if you want to satisfy your curiosity, Josh. So go on; it won’t bite.”<br />
<br />
Josh reached out with a shaky hand and slowly wrapped his hand around the base of the thick, meaty cock. Both of the boys breathed in and sighed. Growing more confident with each stroke, Josh worked it up and down, faster, harder. <br />
<br />
Eric crooned as he closed his eyes and lay back, “fuck yeah, keep it up, Joshie. That feels amazing….”<br />
<br />
Josh smirked when a drop of precum spurted from the head of the dick. He leaned forward, placing one hand on the sofa cushion while using his other hand to direct the cock into his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Ughhh, yeah,” Eric sighed breathlessly as the other boy started spicing up his efforts. He first corkscrewed the shaft. Next, he sucked on the head like an oversized pacifier, and then he laughed, which came out like a rumbling around the big dick.<br />
<br />
“Oh man,” Eric whimpered with need, “better be careful with that. You’re playing with a loaded gun.” His head lolled back and forth as his hands balled into fists at his sides, as he strained to keep it in.<br />
<br />
Josh gave him a saucy smile as he licked the head like a lollipop, “fire away,” he commanded in a teasing tone.<br />
<br />
Eric cried as he felt the familiar sensation of his egg-sized balls lurching up to tuck in under his dick before it proceeded to start throbbing. Josh’s eyes bugged out as his cheeks bulged on both sides. Then, as he backed away and his mouth popped off, the excess cum spurted from between his lips before he managed to swallow the rest. “Holy moly, that was huge.”<br />
<br />
“Phew,” Eric sighed as he lifted his shirt to his forehead and wiped away the sweat. He had a tired but satisfied smile on his face as he patted the spot on the couch next to him. Josh took up the invitation and cozied up to his side. “Man, who knew you knew how to suck dick that GOOD,” his squeaky voice suddenly settled at smooth tenor.<br />
<br />
The two boys shared a glance before Josh snickered, “Eric, I know you got a man-sized package, but you don’t got to pretend; you’ll wear your throat out.”<br />
<br />
Eric cleared his throat and spoke, “who’s pretending? I’m just talking like usual,” yet as his lips moved, the voice that came out sounded like a deeper version of his brother’s.<br />
<br />
Josh’s eyes went wide as he watched his friend’s arms; Eric frowned and crossed his arms, “what are you looking at?” Josh tightened his gaze, causing Eric to look downward, “whaa…?” His voice trailed off as he watched his arms slowly grow a dusty down of dark-brown, blackish hair across the forearms, up the back of his upper arms. The hair seemed to thicken as it forested his pectorals, and where the two swathes of hair met in the middle, they made a thicker heart-shaped patch of fur.<br />
<br />
Their gaze ventured downward as the black hair from the middle of his pecs slowly flowed downward and connected to the dark treasure trail coming up from his groin. <br />
<br />
Eric’s hand ghosted over his new pelt as if unsure he should touch it. Then he took the plunge and pressed his palm against the fur and slowly felt it slip between his fingers. <br />
<br />
Josh broke the silence, “you sure are a hairy fucker,” he started laughing, he fell over gasping.<br />
<br />
Eric let his fingers go from the hair to his nipples framed within it. He twiddled a finger around them and closed his mouth on an involuntary hiss of pleasure. “God damn, that’s not real.”<br />
<br />
“Josh, Eric!” A female voice called from downstairs. The two boys glanced at each other with deer-in-headlights expressions. Eric clamped down on his lips; he couldn’t even speak a word without attracting attention. Finally, Josh piped up, “yeah, mom?”<br />
<br />
“Oh good, you guys are upstairs. You know the way, right, Ethan?”<br />
<br />
“Sure do. Thanks, Mrs. Henderson,” Ethan replied. Eric frowned; his brother’s voice sounded a bit strained and maybe a touch less confident than usual. <br />
<br />
His musing thoughts distracted him, as he didn’t jump into action until two pairs of feet cleared the steps and someone threw open the door.<br />
<br />
Josh jolted to his feet to run interference, but Ethan crashed into the room. Eric only sagged in relief when he realized that the other pair of feet clonking outside belonged to Haylee. When his older brother took stock of Eric, his eyes went agog as he exclaimed excitedly, “Eric? What the hell happened to you?!” His voice which had been a weak tenor cracked into a higher octave and chose to stay that way. Ethan clamped his hands to his mouth, but it had been too late. Haylee winced in sympathy before becoming distracted by Eric’s new developments.<br />
<br />
“What happened to me?” Eric whispered in disbelief in a husky bedroom voice as he pointed at Ethan’s throat. “What happened to YOU?” His voice came out as an impressive boom, “you sound like one of those pre-teen choir boys before their balls dropped.” The comment caused the older boy to blush red as he rubbed the back of his neck self-consciously.<br />
<br />
Haylee watched the verbal ping-pong game with undisguised interest as Josh twisted a finger in his ear as if it was his hearing that was the root cause of this odd situation. “Boys, boys,” Haylee attempted to cut in, with hands up before gesturing her palms down. “Clearly, this has gone a bit far. We need to consider what’s going on here and see what we can do about it. Can we discuss this like reasonable, calm people?” The brothers shared an expressive gaze between the two of them and, in unison, agreed. “Alright, let’s sit down and talk….”</p>
