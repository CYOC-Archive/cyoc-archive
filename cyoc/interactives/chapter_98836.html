<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike Searle stood alone, eyes closed, leaning forward with his forehead against the tiled shower wall of the boys locker room at his high school, letting the warm water hit the back of his neck and flow down back and ass. Hoping it would wash away the funk that he had been in this week as well as the streak of jazz slowly sliding down the tiled wall in front of him. It was only Wednesday, but it already ranked up there as one of the worst weeks he&#39;d experienced in his high school career. &quot;Mike you in there&quot; boomed Couch French. &quot;Yea couch, just taking a shower&quot; Mike replied back defeatedly. &quot;Alright, just checking on you,&quot; answered back, sounding concerned, &quot;shake it off, you can&#39;t win them all, everyone has off games.&quot; before turning to leave. Off games, Mike thought, what had happened tonight was a disaster, and wasn&#39;t isolated just to the game, but to his entire life this week. <br />
<br />
It stared first thing Monday morning. Mike woke up to the alarm like any other day, only today his little brother Ryan wasn&#39;t there to turn it off. &quot;Ryan Alarm!&quot; his twin Aaron yelled, face down in his pillow, but the alarm continued. Aaron raised his head, saw that Ryan wasn&#39;t there and with a, &quot;what the fuck&quot; crawled over from his bed onto Ryan&#39;s and turned off the blaring siren. Ryan never got up early, he was always the last one to shower, it had always been like that. Mike&#39;s didn&#39;t linger on this, as his thoughts quickly turned to the dream he was rapidly forgetting. Not so much the imagery or sounds, he couldn&#39;t remember anything about that, but the feeling. It was like a warm electric pulse spreading through his body, tingling everywhere it went. Mike patted his boxers lightly to make sure it wasn&#39;t a wet dream. It wasn&#39;t, he hadn&#39;t had one of those in years. Mike looked over at Aaron who had returned to his position, face down in his pillow. Mike didn&#39;t want to be the last shower, there was never enough hot water, so he got out of bed, grabbed his towel and climbed downstairs heading out to the barn.<br />
<br />
The barn shower, as they all called it, was a 5x8 foot rectangle of corrugated tin on a concrete slab in the back of the barn next to the the pump house. Some pipes went from the pump house to an old water heater, that was well past its prime, up the outside center of the tin, to a removable hand held shower head. It had a sliding barn door that opened out to the pasture and another on the other side inside the barn. This way you could walk a horse or a cow right in and then out to where ever they needed to go all clean. Mike walked through the kitchen in his underwear past his mother, who had long ago given up trying to make them wear shorts or pants before they showered. Why would I put something on just to take it off a minute later, they retorted, even their father the few times he had to use the barn shower, whenever she protested followed by a just don&#39;t look. Ryan was the only one who actually listened to her complaint and followed her recommendation. As Mike made his way out of the house and towards the barn, his towel around the back of his neck and over his shoulders, warm, gentle summer breeze blew past. The sensation of the slight wind brushing over his skin and almost kissing his nipples and teasing the head of his cock brought him almost immediately to maximum stiffness. His hard dick pressed straight out from his body, straining against his cotton underwear. He hurried into the barn before his mother noticed, he disliked how sensitive his dick was on such moments, his father was already out there working on some piece of machinery, his radio blaring some AM talk radio. He just got a few seconds of some bible thumping preacher, warning about the temptations of this world, before he tuned it out. Mike was still rock hard when he got to the shower, he tossed his towel over the wall and pulled down his briefs. He was considering trying to take advantage of prolonged morning wood, and trying to figure out if he had enough time before Aaron got to the shower to blast one out of his &quot;corn cob&quot; as he affectionately called it that he didn&#39;t even realize Ryan was still in there. He stared at his hard cock, it looked smaller, much smaller even at what he could tell was maximum hardness but much more girthy than it usually was. His cock was his pride and joy, ladies loved it, and guys were jealous of it. He and Aaron had measured each other before and Mike pushed it a little bit he could say he was 10&quot; hard. He didn&#39;t know anyone else who had such a mighty appendage. Today however it looked below average. He walked into the shower and made it a few steps before he heard Ryan&#39;s voice, &quot;Hey! Occupied!&quot; Mike looked up, Ryan was standing there looking like a deer in headlights. Seeing Ryan&#39;s crotch Mike gasped seeing the dangling monster. Mike couldn&#39;t take his eyes off it, so Ryan took after the family after all. Mike had heard rumors that Ryan had a teeny tiny needle dick, but looks like those weren&#39;t true. Or he had grown a lot lately. Ryan&#39;s dick had to be a foot long, and so thick the kid probably couldn&#39;t get his hands all the around it when it was hard. Mike broke his stare, &quot;What the fuck kid, what you doing up so early?&quot; Mike exclaimed. &quot;I woke up early&quot; Ryan said back, &quot;You might want to cover that up.&quot; pointing at Mike&#39;s still hard cock. Ryan turned and took two steps towards him, towering over Ryan he spoke with a deep tone while his cock was still hard. &quot;Get out squirt, it&#39;s my turn to shower, it&#39;s my business what I do in the shower.&quot; Ryan looked at his hard dick. &quot;Huh&quot; Ryan facial expression was as  innocent as he could manage and his tone as lighthearted as he could keep it, &quot;You&#39;re really different down there, huh...&quot; Ryan pointed at Mike&#39;s penis. Mike reddened and called Ryan a fag and grabbed Ryan&#39;s penis pulling it somewhat painfully, &quot;You better watch it before I pull this off&quot; he let go of ryan who was pretending to be cringing pain. Ryan then walked out of the shower unknown to Mike he had a big dumb grin on his face. How the fuck did that little twerp grow such a oversized appandage, and what the hell had happened to his cock? Mike thought about this as he stepped into the still running water. As the water flowed down his chest and around his still sizable, still hard unit, the sensation was too much. Mike let out an audible &quot;ooohhhh, ohh fuck&quot; his ass checks clenched, his hips spasmed, and he fired his load all over the metal wall of the shower. Mike looked around shocked, he caught a flash moving at the door to the shower. Had Ryan seen that? He hoped not. He smashed some water at the mess and tried to get it down the drain, it was almost clean when Aaron got to the shower. &quot;Times up&quot; he bellowed and Mike got out of there and back to the house as fast as he could. <br />
<br />
Mike and his brothers ate quickly, got their cousin Jeff and made it to school in the knick of time. Mike didn&#39;t want to be there any longer than he had too. At school, it was one embarrassing incident after another. He didn&#39;t know what which was worse; his lack of basic coordination, the almost constant erections which left his underwear and pants with precum stains, or the fact that looking at guys that was making it happen. His best friend Peter jumping on his back in the hallway after second period almost made him cum, he got so excited. Peter was a tall redhead who was on the varsity basketball team with Mike. He had quick, muscular, athletic frame and a treasure trail that went from his navel down to an average length but above averagely thick dick. He was the only guy on the team that even came close to Mike&#39;s former thickness. He remembered they use to joke that they ruined women for other men, after they were in there was too much room for lesser dicks. Just thinking of seeing Peter&#39;s fat cock in the shower made Mike&#39;s stiffen and start leaking, spilling out of his underwear and down his leg. Yet when he met up with his girlfriend, Lauren before lunch, nothing. <br />
<br />
Tuesday came and went about the same as Monday. Mike was second to the shower again despite fighting the urge came all again, he spent the rest of the shower tryng push it all down the drain before Aaron came out. He spent the day hiding his erections and fantasizing about different guys he had seen naked over the years, even wondering for a second what it would be like to take it from Aaron...<br />
<br />
Wednesday morning. He and Aaron woke up the same time as they always did. Ryan hadn&#39;t beat them to the shower this time and lay in bed with the top eight or nine inches of his morning wood sticking out of the band of his underwear. Mike looked over at Aaron who was staring at Ryan&#39;s unit, probably wondering the same thing he had on Monday. When did that happen? Aaron looked back at Mike and called &quot;first shower&quot; and started heading down the ladder. Mike following closely behind. Aaron seemed a little sheepish when he saw Mike following him, &quot;I&#39;ll come get you when I&#39;m done&quot; Aaron offered. &quot;Nah, I&#39;m not going last and getting only cold water&quot; Mike responded pointing back up at the attic and Ryan. Mike wrapped his towel around his waste as he watched Aaron almost sprint to the barn. When Mike got there, Aaron was already in and he could hear the almost unmistakable sound of his brother having an orgasm. Mike stood in the door to the shower and saw Aaron&#39;s dick shooting out ounce after ounce of hot white cum towards the center of the shower. Him too, Mike thought, so we&#39;re both going through it. Aaron looked embarrassed, &quot;I&#39;ve been so fucking horny lately, I can&#39;t even stop it from happening&quot; he said quietly his head down towards the floor. &quot;Hey got to keep it in shape&quot; Mike offered, glimpsing at his brothers dick as it went from hard to soft. It was thicker than Mike&#39;s but significantly shorter. He remembered always being way bigger than him but now he was just so average. Strangely enough he didn&#39;t find it strange somehow that he used to be so much bigger than his twin.. Mike stepped out of the room and sat by the door. &quot;Hurry up in there, I want to get out before Ryan gets here&quot; He said around the corner. Aaron left, Mike came, and got ready for school.<br />
<br />
The school day went about the same as Monday and Tuesday. People were starting to notice that he was almost always hard and the &quot;spots&quot; that kept appearing on his jeans near the end of his bulge. He saw a few people whispering and pointing. Tonight, he had a game, so he couldn&#39;t let it bother him too much. He had to stay in &#39;beast mode&#39;. He had to go out then and be an animal on the court. Maybe exhausting himself would help put an end to all this. The school day ended and Mike went down to the locker room to dress for the game. The entire team was there getting each other psyched up, as he walked in Peter came running over to him shouting a vicious war cry, &quot;he grabbed the back of Mike&#39;s head and pushed there foreheads together and yelled something about crushing it tonight, they were so close Mike could have kissed him, he felt his dick harden. Not now he thought. He changed quickly, even putting on one of the a fresh pair of underwear he&#39;d brought since he&#39;s started almost constantly leaking from his dick. The team went out for some pregame warm out, the crowd had already taken its place. Mike felt good in this moment, this was what he lived for, the cheering crowd, defeating another team, feeling like a champion. This was going to set him right, this was his moment. <br />
<br />
Mike and his team were crushed. Mike barely got to play and when he played it was  like he had never even touched a basketball on the court that night.  He missed every pass, every lay-up, every free throw, every three pointer. The other team bulldozed them and won by 40 points. The locker room at the other end of the game was less jubilant. There season was over now, there would be no chance at state this year. Mike sat mostly in silence, offering the occasional good game, and hey it happens to the occasional teammate until they were all gone. He stripped down and headed to the shower, where he came all over the wall as soon as the water made its way over his dick. He put his head against the tile and thought, what the fuck is happening to me. He left the shower, wearing only his towel around his waste, and went to his locker he heard a toilet flush, out of the room within the locker room that had the toilets came Aj, Ryan&#39;s friend. Aj saw Mike and stopped a few feet only a few feet away from him a bit surprised. Aj was a few inches shorter than Mike but in great shape. For someone who claimed just to go for runs and not lift weights, he had a lot of muscle definition. Mike had seen him shirtless before and he had the beginnings of a nice set of abs. Aj looked at him and sighed and walked over to put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t mind it, not everyone is a star basketballer some people just have to work hard.&quot; He slapped his back. &quot;How about you and I go for a drink this evening?&quot; He looked at Aj with a sorrowful smile. Aj&#39;s face was surprisingly soft and strangely feminine to him. He nodded his head. &quot;Yeah, let&#39;s do that.&quot;</p>
