<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(authors note:  Just a recap.  Timothy is normal sized, with a cock as thick as his leg, and just as long (still slowly growing) Saul is a tiny little bunny now, and has stopped shrinking.  Scott is now a 2ft tall muscley but also slightly chubby Raccoon, with a dwindled in size piece.)<br />
<br />
     The three of them decide to try and fix the box.  Something none of them knows anything about.  Timothy looks at the ring of keys for any clue at all.  Each key looked the same as the next.  It was incredibly hard to tell what key went where.  As if the box's creator wanted people to learn by trial and error ... giving the hope that this could be reversed.<br />
<br />
Timothy picked out the one key that had a tiny, almost insignificant difference than the rest of them.  He actually had to use a magnifying glass to see that the handle of the key was shaped moer diamond like than the rest of the circular shaped keys.<br />
<br />
Timothy tried this key in the first lock, it wouldn't turn either direction.  He tried the second, and still no luck.  The third ... nope.  Fourth?  No.  He was running out of locks for this key, and rather quickly.  He picked up the box, and began to study the locks, maybe they had a similar shape to the key? ... No ... They all looked exactly the same as the previous one, in every detail.  Even they key 's cut shape looked identical to the previous one.  All the locks seemed to be identical, yet only one particular key fit in each lock and would turn?  Bizzare little contraption indeed.<br />
<br />
Even the gems were all identical.  Each one was an ovular amber, set in what looked like tarnished silver.  They looked quite nice, but they gave little hint at the box's true powers.  And it seemed more and more like they would never find out, now that the box doesn't work.  Timothy flipped the box onto it's side, then it's back, then back to it's sitting position &quot;It looks so harmless&quot; Timothy whispered to his to small companions.<br />
<br />
Timothy shrugged a bit, and tried that oddly shaped key in every lock, box in hand.  Nothing happened.  Tim was about to put the box down when Scott shouted something.  Timothy looked down at him and listened &quot;Tim, turn the box over, quick!&quot;  Tim cupped his hands on each side of the box, fingers over thumbs, like holding a sandwich, and flipped it over as instructed.  Tim gasped ...<br />
<br />
There was now, right in the process of forming, a little key hole, that was slightly more diamond shaped than the rest of the locks.  Being a curious fox, Tim put the key in, and turned.  Nothing happened ... at first.  Out the top of the box, dropped what looked like a raw, pinkish, glowing crystal.  Timothy watched as it landed ... right on his softened length.  It didn't all quite fit in his sheath.  It made it look more like a furry, overstuffed sleeping bag than it did a sheath, in the process.<br />
<br />
Tim yipped, making the anxious fox noise.  The crystal's glow began to intensify as it seemed to meld right into his length.  As the crystal became smaller and smaller untill it seemed to dissapear completely.  Tim blinked and managed to say 'uhh' before his cock began to glow with the intensity of the crystal.  Tim folded his ears back against his head and howeled!  The combination of fear and awe made him nervous.  He closed his eyes, now not noticing that his cock glowed with the redness of a stove's electric burner on max.  Saul and Scott saw it, and they weren't exactly sure what to do about it.<br />
<br />
When Tim opened his eyes, he saw the glow fading from his length.  No pain, no discomfort, just a fading light.  Reminiscent of a flourescent light on the fritz.  Just enough to be dimly lit, then nothing.  Tim blinked.  There was a calm, errie silence from all three of them.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell just happened?&quot; pipied up the raccoon.  Saul shrugged, and Tim wasn't sure exactly what to say.  It's not everyday a strange crystal hits the oversized length of an anthro fox, while a micro rabbit and a shunken raccoon watched as it seems to sink in and put on a light show the equivalent of a laser light show.<br />
<br />
Timothy reaches out a tentative, shaky paw, and gave his length a feel.  It felt alright.  His sheath and balls felt the same.  So what the heck was that?  Just as Tim was going to set down the box, he spotted a tiny little sheet of paper.  Heck, it was about the size that Saul could probably read it.  Timothy gently handed it to Saul, so that he might be able to read it to them.<br />
<br />
Saul began &quot;To whomever finds this note.  it is not too late for you.  The box has a failsafe.  Simply put in all the keys at once to the box, and press the ges, in order from left to right, and everything the box has done will be undone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy whispred &quot;Can the box be repaired?  What about me, and you, and Scott?  What if we broke the box, and now it cannot be fixed?&quot;  He stammered, breaking into a whimper.  He really enjoyed his new appearance, and especially his package, but living in hiding forever from all his friends would drive him mad.<br />
<br />
Saul shushed the fox &quot;There's more Tim, let me finish!&quot;  Tim nodded and listened.  &quot;If the box should ever become damaged, the crystal within the box, the source of the box's power will be revealed.  It's power will be given to whomever touched it first...  Be forwarned&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott blinked and looked at Tim, half nervous and half in awe &quot;Does that mean you have the power now, or it it whomever touched the box first, like the note says?&quot;  Tim blinked several times and shook his head, rubbing at his temples &quot;I honestly don't know Scott, but in either case, that is both me.  I touched it first, and my length ate that crystal thing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Timothy began to feel funny.  All the color from his face seemed to be slowly wiped away.  Tim's eyes rolled int othe back of his head, and he slumped into the chair behind him, passed out cold.<br />
<br />
Saul and Scott both lookd at Tim.  &quot;What do we do now?  That damn box just gets weirder and weirder each time I see it.&quot;  Saul shouted to Scott.  He just nodded to Saul &quot;Your telling me!&quot; Scott stated, looking himself over again.  He always valued his package and stature, but now he doesn't even have that.  He's still muscular, but he's so short now.  Even Tim's biceps and chest looked bigger, and Tim barely worked out at all.  Scott began to shake Timothy, who snapped to life on the third nudge.  Tim sat up straight and grinned from one side of his muzzle, clear to the other.  two rows of carnivorous teeth making Saul inwardly flinch, even making Scott tak a step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand now.  Us, the keys, the gems, the box.&quot; Tim said, his grin not dissapearing.  Saul blinked &quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Scott nodded to that, he was curious too.<br />
<br />
&quot;The box.&quot;  Tim said again.  &quot;We were meant to find it.  The box finds the good in people, and their potential for greatness.  It's older than perhaps even the human race itself.&quot;  Tim shrugged a bit &quot;It's history is a little fuzzy to me, but I do know that it was the most powerfull thing ever created.  It seeks out the good in people, and brings out their true desires, giving near ultimate power to whomever first touches it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saul clued in, Scott looked clueless.  &quot;So you can do anythign that box could?&quot;  Tim nodded &quot;In fact, the box is useless now.  It can do nothing but hold objects, like any other box.&quot;  Scott looked a little pale.  The fox in front of him with nearly infinite powers was usually the one he dominated with Saul in a threesome.  He decided to speak up &quot;So then, why did I change into a raccoon, and Saul into a rabbit, or you into a fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim chuckled &quot;Because that aparently is what we've always wanted to become.  The box knew that, and inevitably found us, and made it happen.&quot;  Saul blushed inwardly.  He did like rabbits, and was always happy when Timothy would show him pictures of morphic rabbits from the internet, but to be one ... that was the dream, now a reality.<br />
<br />
Scott was having similar thoughts.  He did enjot beign a top, but he really did want to be smaller, and be used and abused.  He longed to be a toy.  His kinks were far more extensive, and the box knew them all.  He wanted to be used in every sence of the word.  To be comletely under someone's controll like that thrilled him to every extent.  His little length stirring to attention as he thought about it.<br />
<br />
Timothy himself aparently got the power because, although he may enjoy playing tricks on people sometimes, he would never ever do anything without someone's permission, that turned him right off.  He even had a little bit of trouble when Scott wanted a rape scene from him and Saul in the bedroom, making them the dominant ones.  However, he knew Scott really wanted to do it, and Saul as usual was up for anything that had him getting some, so he went along with it.  He surmised that the reason his cock kept growing like that was because he had always wanted to be far too hung for his own good, and it looked like now that he was, indeed.<br />
<br />
Timothy grinned to himself.  He had to see exactly what he could do.  He turned to look at Scott, who blushed up at the towering fox.  Tim felt a surge of excitement flow through him, giving him little shakes from it all.  His huge length stirred to life, slowly sliding free of his sheath.  Oh yes ... today would be an interesting day, no doubt about it.  No more tiny Tim.  No more scrawny little weak Tim.  He had power now, and he was lerning at an incredible rate just how to use it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott, my cock demands attention, suck it.&quot;  Tim commanded.  Scott twinged weakly, &quot;But, your so big, how could I please you?&quot;  Tim was about to grumble, but he saw Scott's erection surge, he was enjoying it already.  Scott stepped forward and did as he was told.<br />
<br />
... Oh yes, Tim was going to have himself some fun today, indeed ...</p>
