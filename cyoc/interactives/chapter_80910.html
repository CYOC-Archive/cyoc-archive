<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin entered the number 15 into the remote, figuring it was a logical choice with it being his 15th birthday. <br />
After entering the number, the screen flashed white and the words &quot;Point remote towards person of interest and <br />
press the start button&quot; appeared in black. He felt a bit unsure whether to continue now, seeing as the only <br />
person in the house was him, and would be for the next several hours. He didn't even know what the remote <br />
did. His brother didn't have the time to explain it to him before being ushered out by their stepmother. A <br />
look through the instruction manual didn't really help, sounding more fictional than fantasy. To test it, he <br />
pointed it at the lamp next to him and nothing happened, nor did the screen change from the command. Aiming <br />
the remote at other random objects in the house with nothing happening, he finally gathered the courage to <br />
finally point it at himself. He tensed up and turned his head away before finally pressing the enter button. <br />
It felt like an electrical jolt went through his body, causing him to gasp from the shock. The AP must of <br />
meant something like Advance Power, and the remote was a way to prank people in various ways. A dinging sound <br />
came from the remote. Erin looked at the screen and a progress bar was on it, already at 3%. He shrugged and <br />
guessed it was probably an automatic recharge or something. He threw it onto the sofa and went to get ready.<br />
<br />
Erin entered the bathroom and turned on the shower before stripping out of his pajamas, which must of shrunk <br />
in the wash because they felt a bit tight. Looking at his reflection, he thought he looked a bit taller than <br />
earlier, and maybe a little more toned. Looking closer, he could see he now had a few chest hairs. He grinned, <br />
thinking of how jealous his twin, Sam, would be that he got chest hair before him. He entered the shower and <br />
started rubbing shampoo into his hair, keeping his eyes closed from the suds. It was starting to feel a bit <br />
long, but didn't he get his hair cut just last week? It didn't bother him too much. Next, he grabbed a bar of <br />
soap and lathered up his own body. He had that feeling of uneasiness again as his body felt vaguely unfamiliar <br />
under his hands, like there was more there than normal. Even his cock felt a little bigger, the part of his <br />
body he was most familiar with. It wasn't until he'd stuck his head under the shower to wash out the shampoo <br />
that he definitely knew something was up. Hair was falling into his face, and wiping it out, he only felt more <br />
hair that wouldn't budge. What was going on? He wiped his face free of water, his hand running along hair on <br />
his face, and saw a foreign body. <br />
<br />
He was tall, his head now only inches away from the shower head, but his body had kept its initial <br />
proportions, keeping toned and muscled. The few hairs he'd noticed on his chest before entering the shower had <br />
multiplied and covered his pecs with a light coating, a thick line connected it to the fuzz covering his abs. <br />
Touching his face, he felt it was shaped completely different, and a shaggy beard had pushed it's way through <br />
the skin. His hair had lengthened from the crew cut he was used to, now surrounding his shoulders with curly <br />
locks. He was definitely aroused by the changes, grabbing his erect cock in one of his hands, which had almost <br />
doubled in length to 8 inches, unable to resist pleasuring himself right there. He leaned against the wall and <br />
pumped his cock under the water stream, exploring his hairier body with his other hand, feeling the harder <br />
muscles he now possessed. It was like he could feel the hair grow and spread as he stroked it, making his <br />
heart race and breathing shallow from the stimulation. It wasn't long before he came, large splodges of cum <br />
sticking to his chest hair and beard. he washed the cum out, briefly considering whether to shampoo his new <br />
facial hair, before deciding he should probably find out what actually happened. He turned the water off and <br />
grabbed a nearby towel to dry himself. Whatever happened to him, it seemed to have stopped now. His thoughts <br />
turned to the mysterious remote, that strong jolt he felt after pointing it at himself. The instruction <br />
booklet spoke of fantastical things, but did it really do this to him?<br />
<br />
Erin wanted to see his what his new body looked like, but the mirrors in the bathroom had fogged up, wiping <br />
them only seemed to stain them further. But that didn't matter. There was a full-length mirror in his parents' <br />
room. He opened the door carefully, listening for any sounds that signalled everyone had come back home, but <br />
the place was silent. He walked to the room on the opposite side of the house, feeling his long cock and heavy <br />
balls swinging against his thighs with the movement. He kept his head low, his long hair covering his face, <br />
not wanting to see his reflection until he was directly in front of the mirror. When Erin saw the base of the <br />
mirror at his feet, he hestitated for a moment, then looked up. He was taller than the mirror, possibly 6'5&quot; <br />
and had to crouch to see his face. He gasped. He looked like a homeless man, albeit one who kept clean. His <br />
dark hair, still wet from the shower, strung down past his face, past his shoulders, and stopped a few inches <br />
short of his nipples. His beard was a similar state, looking wild and untamed, his mouth hidden by the growth. <br />
It grew off his face in a mixture of black and ginger hairs, and reached to the same point that the hair on <br />
his head did, mixing with the thicker hair on his chest. He couldn't place the age he was now, somewhere in <br />
his late twenties his assumed. His fluffy beard had a few thin streaks of grey hair breaking through the sea <br />
of dark. He could see lines beginning to form at the corners of his eyes and on his forehead. The rest of his <br />
body looked how he'd guessed based on his experience in the shower, hulking, hairy, and hung. His cock was <br />
already stiff again, turned on by his wildman appearance. <br />
<br />
Erin didn't seem shocked or scared about his sudden change, rather exhilarated at achieving manhood. He found <br />
his stepmom's hair-drier, taking the time to get his hair and beard dry. After he finished, he thought he <br />
looked rather lion-like in appareance. He tied his hair back into a loose ponytail with a hairband. He dug <br />
through his dad's wardrobe, finding the least ghastly looking clothing the man owned and put them own. The <br />
jeans fit perfectly, and the single plain shirt he'd found within the ocean of hideous fabric was a bit small <br />
on him, but it was better than wearing the other options. Looking back in the mirror, he thought he looked <br />
pretty awesome, patting his beard down as it stuck out in all directions. There was no way he was shaving this <br />
off. He ran downstairs, enjoying the way the shirt rubbed his body hair, and grabbed the remote he'd thrown <br />
aside. The screen now said &quot;Changes complete. OK?&quot;, confirming his earlier suspicions. He'd entered 15 into <br />
the device and he guessed it made him 15 years older, thus now making it his 30th birthday. He felt giddy with <br />
excitement. He was 30! His dad and stepmom were only 35, he was almost their age. He could do adult things now <br />
like drink alcohol, and drive unsupervised, and even legally have sex. Nobody would ever mistake him for a kid <br />
again, not with the majestic facial hair he now possessed. But then a crushing realisation hit Erin. His <br />
parents and previously twin brother expected to see his 15 year old self when they got back home. Surely there <br />
was some sort of feature on this remote that could make them think he was already 30. He definitely wasn't <br />
going to go back to his hairless 15 year old self, that was for sure. Looking through the instuction booklet, <br />
there was indeed an option to alter people's perceptions so changes appear normal, but they had to be in close <br />
proximity to the remote when the button is pressed to affect them. He still had a bit of time before they came <br />
back. Maybe he could make another change before they got back. He did wonder what he'd look like a decade or <br />
two older. He stroked his beard like some aged wizard and thought about what to do.</p>
