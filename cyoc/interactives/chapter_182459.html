<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well...” June struggled to think of anything else she could do, “okay then... show me, I guess,”<br />
“O-okay...” Alexis said, letting out a deep breath and looking at her.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t thought about this too hard. Obviously he’d changed his penis, but he didn’t even mean to do that. Then again he made it smaller on command. Maybe this wouldn’t be too hard. Or maybe he was going completely crazy and this was just a random thing that happened to random girls in random bathrooms while giving random guys... maybe it wasn’t so random.<br />
He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, then opened them again. He didn’t know exactly what he he was doing, but he thought really hard.<br />
<br />
June looked at Alexis, seeing him focus intently at her. Right out got her corner of her eye, she saw something. Something dark become much brighter. Her eyes widened and she faced back at the mirror. More and more streaks of blonde started travelling down her hair. Within seconds her hair completely blonde.<br />
<br />
Alexis stopped focussing, letting out a sigh. He was right, it was all real. He really had this ability, and it worked on other people as well as himself.<br />
“Holy shit!” June said, running her hands along her bright blonde hair, “I’m a blonde, oh my god!” She couldn’t believe it, “how did you do it!?” She asked Alexis, still looking at herself. She was even adjusting her hair to what she looked like,<br />
“W-well that’s the part I don’t know,” Alexis started, “I just... I found out this morning when I-” he said, stopping himself when he got to the part he didn’t want to mention,<br />
“When you?” She asked, now turning to him, “what was it?” She pushed,<br />
“I- uh...” he struggled,<br />
“Wait...” she said, thinking about it. Then she smirked, “oh my god,” she said, then proceeded to burst out laughing. Alexis could do nothing but stand there and blush, “typical for a boy,” she said to herself. Returning to look at herself in the mirror,<br />
“I-I mean... I didn’t do it on purpose,” he tried to defend himself,<br />
She continued to laugh, but suddenly stopped as if she realised something,<br />
“Wait...” she said, thinking for a moment, “if you changed your...” she pointed at his crotch. Alexis looked up at the ceiling, awkwardly, “then that means...” she said, again, thinking about it for a last time. Then she looked at Alexis, “you can make my boobs bigger,” she stated,<br />
“W-well!” Alexis shuddered quickly, stepping backwards against the wall,<br />
“You can, right!?” She asked him sternly,<br />
“Well it’s n-not like I’ve tried it before but...”<br />
“But?”<br />
“I guess so...”<br />
“Holy shit!” She said, her eyes lighting up with excitement. She looked at him as they stood there in silence. Alexis didn’t want to make eye contact, but could feel her stare.<br />
<br />
“Come on already!” She said. She grabbed her breasts and lifted them up for Alexis to see through her slowly drying shirt. Alexis was trying his best to not act awkwardly, but he couldn’t stop himself from staring. So much that he felt his penis start to get a little hard. He didn’t think June noticed it, but he was still staring. Then she suddenly dropped her breasts, letting the, bounce a little, “W-why the hell are you getting...” she asked, looking at his bulge,<br />
“W-wha...” he struggled to speak, but brought himself to reality said exactly what was on his mind, “what do you expect me to do, just ignore them!?”<br />
“Well, no. But you’re just starting at them... and...” then something clicked in her head, “oh my god, you’re not gay are you!?” She asked in shock<br />
“What!?” He responded, “I’m Bisexual!” He almost shouted,<br />
“I thought... but your boy...” she was piecing everything together, “is that how it happened?” She asked, a little calmer, “when you made my hair like this, was it because you were turned on or something?”<br />
“Uhm...” Alexis hesitated, “I guess... I don’t know. I made my... y’know,”<br />
“After you masturbated,” she finished the sentence for him, “so it is when you’re aroused,” she said,<br />
“I guess...” he replied, scratching the back of her head. He was a little heated right now, but she seemed to be right.<br />
<br />
“So if I...” she quickly walked towards him and grabbed his head, then started making out with him. He pushed her off, not wanting to kiss her. However, his erection hadn’t died down, it had only gotten slightly harder over time, “dammit!” She said, clearly frustrated, “if you just do I’ll leave you alone, okay!”<br />
“Fine!” He said, angrily. He wasn’t even feeling that turned on anymore. His penis getting more and more flaccid. <br />
<br />
But with his anger and frustration being the leaders of his emotions, he looked right at her boobs and watched as her bra became tighter and her shirt begin to strain at the buttons,<br />
“Happy now?” Alexis asked sarcastically, making his way to the door to leave,<br />
“No!” She shouted at him, causing him to stop,<br />
“What else do you want!?” He asked angrily back at her,<br />
“I want them bigger than this, obviously!”<br />
“Ugh!” He looked at her again. Her bra grew tighter and tighter, causing her to wince. That’s when he stopped her growing. Her shirt was straining, buttons one cup size away from popping off.<br />
She reached behind her back and managed to unhook her bra from the outside of her shirt. She untucked it from her skirt and pulled her bra out from it. Alexis could now see her nipples poking against the fabric. The shirt was less strained without the support. The distraction had allowed him a few moments to cool down, to relax everything... apart from his penis, which was back to where it was.<br />
<br />
“So now you’re not going to try and leave?” She asked, sarcastically,<br />
“W-well...” he stuttered,<br />
“I’m okay with that, I wouldn’t mind if these were Double-D’s...” she asked him, fluttering her eyelashes at him, and stepping closer towards him,<br />
“A-aren’t they already how you-” he was caught off guard by her hand rubbing his thigh, getting dangerously close to his dick,<br />
“They can be bigger, though... can’t they?” She asked him, biting her lip. This wasn’t how he usually saw her... in fact he didn’t even think she acted like this when she was dating Justin. But he was starting to not really care.<br />
<br />
He looked at her breasts as they started getting larger. They were staying firm and round as they grew, but looked natural as they did.<br />
Then the first button came off, then the next. He could see her nipples poking through her shirt much more, they were getting harder too, he slowed down. June had her hand on his cock, but over his pants.<br />
He wasn’t waiting any longer. Without even touching his pants, they unbuttoned themselves, and unzipped themselves. June pulled them down, finding his underwear, which as this point could be confused for a large tent.<br />
<br />
“C’mon!” She yelled at him, “bigger!” She yelled. Alexis was aware that people could be listening, so he looked up at the door and made it sealed shut. Not only that, but he made the walls thick enough for no noise to come in. June didn’t notice it, but Alexis could see the walls compact by a few inches.<br />
“Bigger!” She yelled at him again, he complied. Making her breasts even larger. She was now past DD size, and he was sure of it. They were getting bigger and bigger. Buttons were flying off everywhere. And she had pulled down his underwear and started jacking him off.<br />
He grabbed her shirt and tore it off completely. While she continued to jack him off, he grabbed her growing breasts and started playing with them. He looked at her nipples and said,<br />
“What’s the point in having them if no one knows they’re there,” he made her nipples grow bigger and longer and harder. He tweaked at them, causing her to moan louder, which made her jack him off even harder. He was starting to lose sight of reality as he closed in on his climax. He was losing control of everything.<br />
He watched as June orgasmed before him, throwing her head up. But finishing the job.<br />
<br />
Alexis’ penis felt like a rocket. It was the most amazing and extreme thing he’d ever felt in his life. His vision was completely obscured with the pleasure. He felt everything all at once, then passed out.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t sure how long had passed, but he felt himself wake up. He tried to look around, but his vision was blurry. He was starting to make out the colours when he heard a faint voice say, “Alexis,”<br />
He rubbed his eyes, looking around. As his vision lined up, he saw June standing in front of him. But she looked a little... different.<br />
<br />
He rubbed his eyes one last time before looking up at her.<br />
He saw a woman who looked almost a foot taller than him, her breasts looked like a two bags of basketballs hung of her chest, twice the size of her head. Not to mention her nipples, which could easily be mistaken for dinner plates. Her hips were wider than her shoulders by at least a foot, and she had a fat ass. Her thighs were incredibly thick and perfectly plump and round. And speaking of plump, she was plain old thick. Her belly had extra pudge and padding, as well as her arms had extra padding, and even her face was a little softer and rounder, but not by that much. Her lips had to be at least twice as thick, and little darker in colour too.  But that’s when he realised it. She looked about 25 years older. Her face was wrinkled in some spots, as was her body. And right where her hair had streaked before, on her blonde hair were two silver streaks.<br />
<br />
Alexis stood up, looking at this... this...<br />
“Milf,” June said in a mature voice, “you made me a milf?”<br />
“I-I’m sorry I-” Alexis tried to apologise,<br />
“Don’t say sorry, baby,” she said, her body seeming to affect her words, “I have never felt THIS good!” She said grabbing her breasts and squeezing them together. Alexis’ dick was getting ahead of himself, wanting to get hard but aching from the intense orgasm,<br />
“Wait, you don’t want me to try and fix you?” He asked,<br />
“Hell no!” She replied, “I love this body. These hips, these tits, these lips! Mmm!! I cannot get enough of it,”<br />
“But... what about everyone else?” Alexis asked, “what about your friends, your teachers... your parents!?”<br />
“Honey, I don’t mean forever!” She said, laughing a mature and sexy laugh, “I mean... right here, right now, all I want is... I don’t even know!”<br />
“Well I can’t just leave you here, and we need to go back otherwise people will start to worry!”<br />
“Yeah, I know... I’ve just never felt this good before, and I don’t wanna lose it. I feel confident, I feel strong, I feel powerful,”<br />
“You look it, too,” Alexis said. She giggled,<br />
“You’re funny and you’re hot,” she said. Then covered her mouth, “oops... I guess maybe I’m a tad too confident,” Alexis blushed at the remark, but quickly came back to the serious side,<br />
“I have to fix you, June. I’m sorry but I have to,” he said, sternly. She looked disappointed, but took a deep breath,<br />
“Okay. Fine.” She said, “I don’t know why, but I’ll switch back,”<br />
“Thank you,” he said, “that was mature- well I guess that makes sense,” he said. She chuckled.<br />
<br />
He regressed her back to her normal age, along with her body and her hair. She stood there, back to normal. She looked at herself in the mirror, a little sad,<br />
“Can I just ask to have my blonde hair... just so I don’t ever think that this was just a dream? So I always remember that it was real,” she asked Alexis.<br />
<br />
Alexis smiled. He let her hair turn blonde again, streak by streak, just like before. But unexpectedly, she watched as her breasts grew. Growing until they reached DD size, just how she wanted it. He also added some extra padding on her butt and thighs, plus her lips puffed the tiniest bit bigger.<br />
She turned to face Alexis, and gave him a hug. Her breasts pressing into his chest, making his dick react once again. That’s when he remembered,<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, our clothes,” he said,<br />
“Oh my god, I almost forgot,” June said,<br />
“Well...” Alexis said, looking at the walls and the way he had actually made them thicker. He took a quick breath and stared at the clothes on the ground. The buttons began to fly towards the shirt and it fixed itself. Her torn skirt and panties too. Her shoes and socks, which had almost been damaged were now fixed,<br />
“Wow,” June said, “that power is crazy. And you still don’t know how you have it?” She asked,<br />
“Nope. I found out this morning, I feel like maybe it’s just because I turned 18,” he said,<br />
“Maybe. You have my number, right?” She asked, as she slipped on her panties,<br />
“Um...” Alexis hesitated,<br />
“No, no. Not like that,” she clarified, “so you can explain it to me when you find out,”<br />
“Oh... I think I might have it,” Alexis replied. He reached where he pocket was, but realised his underwear and pants were still halfway down his legs. He blushed and pulled them up. June giggled,<br />
“I don’t think you do,” she said, “but anyway,” she handed him a piece of paper, it was smudged ink but had her name and a phone number on it, “it was meant for this other boy, but it think you better have it,” she said, pulling her skirt up. Alexis folded it and placed it in his pants pocket,<br />
“Thanks, I’ll text you later. I think I left my phone at my desk,”<br />
“Oh shit, the period is nearly over,” she said. Alexis looked at her bra on the ground, and out of curiosity, held his hand out. Her bra floated into his hand as if he had just used telekinesis. He felt beyond cool. Smirking, he handed her the bra, “thanks,” she replied. She did her best to put it over her breasts, but it was just too small for them. Alexis then used his power to change the size of her bra. Suddenly it fit on her chest and she was able to hook it easily, “wow. I might need you to do that with the rest of my wardrobe,” she joked.<br />
Lastly, she put buttoned up her shirt, which again was a little small, but nothing Alexis couldn’t fix. He fixed the walls and the door and they stepped out to see a lot of students going from class to class. They’d just missed the end of the period, “wait,” June said, “aren’t they going to notice my changes?” She asked,<br />
“No, it’s not like anyone really notices,” Alexis reassured,<br />
“No!” She said, slapping his arm, “my hair!” She said,<br />
“Oh, uh...” he said, “okay this might not work but it’s my best effort,” he said. He imagined that everyone would just ignore the changes, as if June had always been this way. He wasn’t sure it had worked, but as far as he could tell, there weren’t any heads turned.<br />
Other than at him. Confused, he looked down. He still had his pants on and he looked pretty clean. Then he realised, he had just left the girls bathroom.<br />
Testing his last theory, he imagined everyone knew that he had gone in there with June to vomit. And like that, everyone’s heads went back to what they were doing and where they were going.<br />
<br />
“Okay, everything seems good,” June said, “as strange as all that was. It was cool, and you gotta let me test it out with you when you figure out what’s going on with it,”<br />
“Uhm... sure, I guess,” he replied,<br />
“Awesome.” She finished, “thank you, Alex. I hope to see you ‘round,” she said, leaning over and kissing him on the cheek. Then she left, joining her friends as they walked away. She looked back, and gave him one last smile before disappearing into another hallway.<br />
<br />
Alexis never used to have feelings for June, but he feels like he might do now. He didn’t completely understand her, but her liked her.</p>
