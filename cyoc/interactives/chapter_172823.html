<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>aiming for a slow-burn and consistency with my contributions, so there won&#39;t be any quick sex here. Got a slower sensual vibe in mind with more buildup -- if that&#39;s not your cup of tea, no worries! If it is, enjoy! :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following morning, Jeff woke in a surprisingly good mood. Though he hadn&#39;t been really tired at the start of the previous day, the stress of his mistake and all that had happened after it had taken a lot of the energy out of him, and combined with the spectacular fantasy masturbation session he&#39;d had after arriving home, he&#39;d been exhausted, emotionally and physically. Now, after a good night&#39;s sleep, Jeff felt much better. It was still early-ish, and he stretched as he lay in bed. Pushing the covers down to stomach level, he rolled onto his left side, feeling warm and relaxed.<br />
<br />
He had worn boxers to sleep, the only underwear that he could still fit at all, and instinctively, Jeff reached his right hand down to scratch his balls. Instead, his fingers landed on a softer shape, and he gave a brief grunt of surprise at the contact, before reality sprung the reminder of his situation on him once again. It was easy enough to forget about his transformation in these distracted moments, but at least he only had to weather it for another two days. That&#39;s all he had to worry about getting past, and then he was free to be himself again. Two days!<br />
<br />
Jeff laid his palm flat on the rounded shape, cupping the crotch-breast&#39;s right half through the material, and he thought back to the previous night. The milking had been just as good as the first time he&#39;d tried it, better even, and the ease with which his fantasy had switched away from penis to breast in mid-thought was a little bit disturbing, but ... it didn&#39;t have to mean anything, right? He was just getting into the sexy mood, and had rolled with it -- it was fine to have those thoughts, because he was going to be back to normal before he knew it! Happy with the rationale, Jeff considered that it HAD felt really good though, and he allowed himself to gently rub the side of it as he recalled the details, the satin boxer material sliding in a soft caress across breast-flesh and adjacent thigh in a sensation that was simply delightful.<br />
<br />
Out of nowhere, he felt it give a placid throb, like a heartbeat, surprising him. Hadn&#39;t he calmed it down enough last night? Momentarily confused, Jeff&#39;s teenage male brain immediately told him why. Morning wood! He had morning wood! Though, his lack of a penis made it manifest differently, it was still the same thing. His hormones wanted him to play, and it took only a second for him to decide that it was something he wanted to do again. Maybe- ... maybe he could milk himself once more, before he had to leave his room and face the world? Maybe he could even spend a lot more of this lazy Sunday playing around with it? What was the harm in making the most of this body part, while he still had it?<br />
<br />
Yeah! Why not?<br />
<br />
Shifting his hips into a slightly different position as he moved to get more comfortable, the crotch-breast pressed tightly against the material. It had barely fit in to begin with, and with his movement, the buttons of the fly were nearly digging into the flesh as Jeff adjusted himself. Then with a slight release of pressure he felt the nipple squeeze out through the material gap, clambering to be free. Oh yes! Excited, he wet his finger with his tongue and brought it back down to stimulate, totally ready to &#39;jerk&#39; himself off. Tickling, swirling, the slippery attention of his digit made the nipple stiffen. Each wiggle, slick and soft, send out little bursts that were like joyful lightning across his crotch and lower body, and Jeff marveled that he only needed a fingertip to do this. A goofy dreamy smile on his face, Jeff stared at the wall opposite his bed, and ... played. This was so good! This was amazing! This was perfect! This was-<br />
<br />
Not going to happen.<br />
<br />
The door to the bedroom abruptly opened, and his younger brother poked his head in, not bothering with the courtesy of knocking this time. Jeff stopped dead, mortified, his expression and hand frozen in place, praying that he wasn&#39;t found out, before his brother delivered the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going on a roadtrip. Mom told me to get you up, and that you gotta come down for breakfast right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Right now?&quot; Jeff squeaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what she said.&quot; Jack frowned at him, shooting him a weird look, which seemed to say &#39;what&#39;s the problem with that?&#39; before his eyes narrowed a little. &quot;Unless you want her to come up and tell you herself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;kay.&quot; With that, Jack closed the door, and Jeff let out his breath, giving a frustrated growl. The nipple gave a demanding pulse, seeming to want his attention to continue, but he reluctantly let go and sat up to get dressed. His plans for curing his morning hardness -- or morning softness, as it actually was -- were gone, along with any chance to spend the day enjoying himself in private.<br />
<br />
Dammit!<br />
<br />
Arriving down to breakfast in fresh clothes, though with another similarly baggy pair of sweatpants, Jeff managed to sidle into the kitchen and safely sit. Jack and his dad had already eaten and were elsewhere in the house, while his mom was cleaning up, with Josh in tow. As soon as she saw him, she set down a plate and utensils, along with a glass of OJ. &quot;Eat up, we&#39;ve got a long drive today to get to the national park.&quot; She went to turn back to the sink, but then paused, an afterthought coming to her. &quot;Oh, and sweetheart, if you feel you have to do things like that, choose an appropriate time and place, okay? Family shouldn&#39;t be walking in on anything you don&#39;t want them to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking in ... ? OH! Jack had seen him and told her! But ... his dumbass little brother hadn&#39;t knocked, and then just opened the door without warning! How was THAT fair to him? Still embarrassed and ashamed at having to hear this lecture, Jeff lowered his head, mumbling as he shoveled in food to try and avoid conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmmm, y-yeah. Sorry mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back to the dishes, she nodded. &quot;Make sure you finish the plate! You&#39;ll want to keep your energy up for the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Energy. He powered through the hot breakfast she&#39;d made, finishing the glass at the same time. Not realising how thirsty the milking had made him, he poured himself a second glass of juice from the pitcher, and guzzled it down, then a final third was enough to hit the spot. Three glasses was a lot, but Jeff wasn&#39;t too concerned about a repeat of the previous day. There would be plenty of opportunity for bathroom breaks, and he could even go before they left the house, just to be sure. There was zero chance he&#39;d get stuck in a similar predicament to the pool shed.<br />
<br />
Standing, he handed his mom his plate with the knife and fork, and the empty glass, and she put them in the sink, continuing the task without glancing his way. &quot;Go grab anything you need from your room, your dad and Jack will be finished loading the car by now. We&#39;ll be leaving in less than ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
With clear orders, he rushed back upstairs, the bouncing weight in his crotch providing the exact incentive for how he wanted to use that short amount of time. Finding the other half of the bra from where he&#39;d stashed it, he quickly began to repeat what he&#39;d done yesterday: create a new bra-holster for his transformed body. It took a few minutes of carefully threading and tying to recreate his previous attempt, but the new version seemed a bit more stable. Satisfied it would hold, he stripped off his pants and carefully pulled it on.<br />
<br />
The breast slid into the bra, the fit adequate, the fat nub nestled safely inside against soft material. Like the first incarnation, the cup was a little smaller than needed, but the crotch-breast wasn&#39;t particularly bloated from either bladder or milking problems, so it didn&#39;t matter. He took another minute adjusting it to get it just right, before pulling on a different pair of pants. Something a bit more presentable than sweatpants, but still loose enough for breathing room, and Jeff also chose a longer tee and slightly oversized sweatshirt that came down over his waist, just for added protection. So long as he took care with how he walked, he was well-placed to manage this genital-centred crisis until the end.<br />
<br />
The close calls at the party had definitely taught him he needed to be prepared -- at least for another couple of days.<br />
<br />
He was almost ready, but then he remembered -- toilet before leaving, just to be on the safe side! Closing the bathroom door, he uncaged himself, carefully pulling the holster away so he could get ready to go. There wasn&#39;t much to pee out anyhow, so it would be easy enough to just quickly milk the urine out before-<br />
<br />
KNOCK KNOCK.<br />
<br />
Shit!<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go. We&#39;re on a tight schedule, so we have to leave now.&quot; It was his mom&#39;s voice, muffled a bit, from outside the door.<br />
<br />
Seriously, just when he was about to ... ?<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffrey, honey, didn&#39;t I tell you earlier? There&#39;s a time and place for that sort of thing. I want you out of there in twenty seconds and downstairs, ready to go! No excuses!&quot;<br />
<br />
Defeated, Jeff reversed course, working the crotch-breast back into the bra, and pulling up his pants, he rushed downstairs as fast as he could safely move. He made for the front door, his mom waiting to lock it with a bundle of roadtrip-related personal items tucked in a bag under one arm. As he slotted into the car next to his brothers, Jeff consoled himself with the fact that there would be other opportunities to pee, and that he was in a better state of mind to face the day&#39;s challenges than he was before yesterday&#39;s party.</p>
