<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle asked, &quot;Transform or Dare? Miss Jennifer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare, Kyle,&quot; replied Jennifer. He answered her, &quot;Miss Jennifer, I dare you to say the line <br />
back to me.&quot; Jennifer smiled and said, &quot;The line.&quot; A split second after she said it, she <br />
wondered why the hell she said that. Liz laughed and said, &quot;Jenn, you told him to dare you <br />
to say 'the line' back to him. So he did, and so did you.&quot; Jennifer threw her arms up, and <br />
wailed, &quot;Oh just great, now the whole thing is fucking ruined.&quot; She started to storm off <br />
angrily.<br />
<br />
Jamie quickly stood up and stopped her. &quot;No it isn't, Jenn. He passed the curse back to <br />
you. Just because he didn't tell you to say it right back to him doesn't mean that anything <br />
is ruined. You can still curse him.&quot; Jennifer, who always recognized that Jamie was smarter <br />
than her, realized she was right. &quot;Oh thank God,&quot; she said, sighing heavily. &quot;Thanks Jamie.&quot; <br />
Now turning back to Kyle she said, &quot;Before we continue there are a few questions I need <br />
ask you. Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he said. &quot;First of all,&quot; she began, &quot;do you know why we're here?&quot; &quot;Yes, <br />
Miss Jennifer,&quot; he answered, &quot;you're here because I cursed you this morning.&quot; She then <br />
asked, &quot;Can you remember everything that you've ever done up to this point?&quot; &quot;Yes, Miss <br />
Jennifer,&quot; he replied. <br />
<br />
She continued her questions, all of which they had planned out earlier in the day. &quot;Now <br />
then, when will your parents be home?&quot; she asked. Kyle said, &quot;Probably not until 6 o'clock <br />
or so, Miss Jennifer.&quot; &quot;These are important questions,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you like being able to <br />
fuck me?&quot; &quot;Oh, yes, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he said. &quot;Would you like to do it again sometime?&quot; she <br />
asked. &quot;Definitely, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he told her.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then said, &quot;Kyle, you can stop calling me Miss Jennifer now. Thanks. Now then, are <br />
you still mad at me for what I did to you? Please be honest.&quot; He looked down at his feet, as <br />
if he hoped the answer would spring up from the floor. He said, &quot;I don't know. Yes and <br />
no.&quot; &quot;Why is that?&quot; she wondered. &quot;I'm mad at you for humiliating me,&quot; he told her, &quot;but I'm <br />
also not since you let me fuck you. And because you could've turned me into a toad or <br />
something like that, but you haven't.&quot; &quot;Do you remember what I told you about being <br />
popular and everything after we're done?&quot; she asked. He simply nodded his head. &quot;Would <br />
you still like to be?&quot; she said. &quot;Well, are you going to be my friend?&quot; he asked. Jennifer <br />
replied, &quot;We all are. Right, girls?&quot; He looked at them, all still sitting on the couch. They all <br />
nodded, saying &quot;Yea, sure, of course.&quot; He told Jennifer, &quot;Yea I guess I would like to be <br />
popular then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now came the important part. Jennifer told him, &quot;You have to accept a change then, OK?&quot; <br />
His mind was in torment. He didn't really want to say yes, feeling he would still be unable <br />
to trust her. He clutched his head again, and said, &quot;I don't know.&quot; Jennifer changed her <br />
wording. &quot;Kyle, you will become popular like us, and you will accept a change to do so.&quot; <br />
Kyle stopped clutching his head, and replied, &quot;Yes, I will.&quot; Jennifer laid it down for him. &quot;OK <br />
then, Kyle, I'm going to ask you the question, and you have to say Transform. Everything <br />
will be fine. We aren't going to hurt you, and you will love our results. After it is done, we'll <br />
share our world with you.&quot; A tear rolled from his eye. He was still trying to fight it, but <br />
could not for the power of the dare. &quot;OK, Jennifer,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then Kyle, from now on call me Jenn. OK?&quot; she said. &quot;Yes, Jenn,&quot; he replied. She <br />
asked the question. &quot;Kyle Perkins, Transform or Dare?&quot; Once again, he clutched his head, <br />
before his lips said, &quot;Transform.&quot; Jennifer and her friends had carefully arranged how the <br />
curse would be read. There could be no going back once it was said. It was up to Jennifer <br />
to get it right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Kyle. Now as I said we won't hurt you. And I'm not really mad at you anymore. <br />
You helped to bring me and my three closest friends even closer to each other. And we <br />
had some fun doing it. So we decided that you should join our little circle, since it was <br />
thanks to you that all of this happened.&quot; Kyle looked stunned. He wasn't sure what the hell <br />
she was talking about. &quot;But, she said, we really can't have a male be in our circle.&quot; Kyle's <br />
eyes widened with fear. He could figure out what that meant. Now more tears began to <br />
well up in Kyle's eyes. He started to protest. &quot;But...I-I don't w-want to be a girl.&quot; Jennifer <br />
rolled her eyes, and said &quot;You don't have a choice now Kyle. &quot;Please....&quot;, Kyle continued to <br />
beg for the preservation of his manhood. &quot;Well Kyle, if you’re so dead set against I might <br />
just let you off&quot; Relief coloured Kyle’s face. “But we still can’t have a male friend, or at least <br />
not one who’s attracted to us,” she continued” It would ruin our friendship”. His eyes <br />
widened. She continued, &quot;That's right, Kyle. You are going transform into a young, healthy, <br />
sexy, beautiful guy, but you will be attracted to men just like the rest of us, but...you will <br />
keep the intelligence level you now possess, since you're smarter than we are. You will <br />
also keep your past memories and experiences. You will also have memories of being on <br />
the cheer squad and outing yourself which everybody will also have and accept without <br />
aggression or hostility. And most importantly, the only people who will have any memories <br />
of Kyle Perkins as you are now will be me, you, Trish, Liz, and Jamie. That will take care of <br />
any problems with your parents, and the rest of the world remembering you as straight.<br />
<br />
 You agreed to it. It will happen as soon; you will become a tall handsome, tanned, queer <br />
cheerleader with a drop-dead gorgeous swimmers build. You’ll have bright blue eyes and <br />
long bright blond surfer hair and excel in all your subjects as well as being athletic and <br />
acrobatic. You will have a lovely bubble butt to go with that lovely long schlong of yours. <br />
And last of all you will become twins, identical in mind and body, excelling in all the same <br />
subjects and sharing the same preferences but having different but matching <br />
personalities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle’ s eyes bugged out at Jennifer’s proclamation, even as they changed to lovely but <br />
almost unnatural shade of blue specified in the curse. His arms and legs lengthening and <br />
his body gaining the muscle required for the acrobatics of cheerleading. His hair changing <br />
to the long, blond, shaggy, surfer spikes specified by Jennifer. Kyle stood up leaving a <br />
copy of his new hotter body sitting there on the couch; Jenn admired the new rear the boy <br />
had just acquired. Kyle turned to find his clone, his new twin brother, occupying the seat <br />
he had just vacated.</p>
