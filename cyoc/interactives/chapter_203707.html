<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy the puppy was conflicted. While playing with the kids was fun, he’d noticed odd changes around the house. At this point, he knew Tex had cast as a spell on…someone. He didn’t THINK it had been targeted at him, he was already pretty screwed with the Command and Familiar spell. But he could feel the spell in the air, it was palpable to him now. A shiver up the spine, a coppery tingle in the mouth like licking a battery.<br />
<br />
Lenny and his wife, Shelly would argue when the kids were playing. He was too distant, she’d make dinner almost an hour earlier than Lenny got home so it was always cold. It was really passive aggressive. Lenny slept on the couch.<br />
<br />
He tried communicating with Lenny after the first 24 hours was up. Use the Alphabet magnets on the fridge to cry for help. Scratch messages in the dirt. It didn’t matter what he tried, it just ended up looking like random words and scratches. He knew how to speak, read, write, but it was like he had Dyslexia now or something, everything was jumbled.<br />
<br />
More terrifyingly, he was losing his ability to comprehend human speech. It wasn’t bad yet, just the really big technical words were eluding him. He figured he’d be fine for a few days, but much longer than that and he might as well just be another dog anyways. Troy thought it might be the distance between Tex and himself-he wasn’t sure how far away he could be to keep the Familiar bond going.<br />
<br />
At the end of the second day, the cubs were dropped off at their grandmother’s house. Troy wondered why at first, and then Rusty arrived at the door. Troy barked happily and was shushed.<br />
<br />
“Hey Rusty, thanks for coming over.” Lenny’s burly form shifted out of the way as Rusty swaggered in.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, thanks.” Rusty smirked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you didn’t tell me your partner was here.” Shelly was confused. “Um, have a seat, I’ll make another plate for you.”<br />
<br />
Troy tried getting Rusty’s attention and it worked-sort of. He was picked up by the muscular Doberman and played with. Troy knew he didn’t recognize him, but being held by his boyfriend made him so happy.<br />
<br />
The conversation continued and…was Shelly giving Rusty bedroom eyes? Oh God, Troy was going to kill Tex. He couldn’t change Lenny’s sexuality or we’d all revert into nerdy gay pigs. But he could change her. He could change Rusty.<br />
<br />
So, when the conversation shifted into what Rusty was really here about, Troy was exasperated.<br />
<br />
“I’m here because I was wondering if you two were interested in…Sleeping with me.” Rusty said.<br />
<br />
Lenny and Shelly glanced at each other.<br />
<br />
“You want to fuck my wife, Rusty?” Lenny demanded.<br />
<br />
Shelly pursed her lips.<br />
<br />
“No, I want to fuck you and your wife, Lenny.” Rusty said. “It’s what is known as a three-way. Menage-a-trois, as the French say.”<br />
<br />
“But…that’s gay!” Lenny sputtered. <br />
<br />
Troy realized Lenny was feigning outrage. How long had these two practiced this little performance? Anyways, he’d seen Chasing Jamie, three-ways didn’t fix broken relationships, they just drove the wedge in further. Even if she agrees, she’s just doing it because Rusty is attractive.<br />
<br />
“So that’s what this is all about?” Shelly frowned. “You’ve been sleeping with your partner?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Lenny’s jaw dropped. “Where the hell did you get that idea?”<br />
<br />
“Please. A wife knows.” Shelly rolled her eyes. “And you think a three-way with your boyfriend is going to save our marriage? Haven’t you seen Chasing Jamie? It never works.”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded. “Figured.”<br />
<br />
“I love you Shelly, I just-.”<br />
<br />
“You got bored and stepped out on me and now you’re putting on a show so…what? So I won’t be mad about it?” Shelly stood. “Like I said, I knew. I’m not going to divorce you, Lenny. I have two cubs to take care of. All I want from you is respect. Ask me how my day is. Put away the dishes. Stop pissing on the toilet seat after I told you a thousand times to stop.”<br />
<br />
Lenny sat silently.<br />
<br />
Rusty stood and gathered his things.<br />
<br />
“Where do you think you’re going?” Shelly asked.<br />
<br />
“Leaving.” Rusty shrugged.<br />
<br />
“No you aren’t. Get up stairs. Now.” Shelly growled. “And you better show me the best action I’ve gotten in 6 months. You too Lenny. And you’d better not sit in the corner and jerk off. I didn’t marry a cuck.”<br />
<br />
All three went up to the Master bedroom. Troy tried to block the sounds coming from the room. Judging from the moans, Shelly was very pleased.<br />
<br />
The next day came and Tex picked him up.<br />
<br />
“Adult.” Tex pointed when they were safely in the car.<br />
<br />
Troy grew back into the muscular Rottweiler he had been, all the training his owner had put him through returning.<br />
<br />
“How the hell did that work?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“RK used his spell to make sure the best outcome would come to pass. Cemented the best future.” Tex shrugged. “They didn’t get divorced.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t even think of using RK.” Troy mused.<br />
<br />
“Neither did I. RK suggested it, since Lenny’s issue was intruding on developing our plan to tackle Myth. Oh, and Todd didn’t show up for work.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Troy’s memories were vague, but he did remember. “No, I gave him a work from home position because I knew he’d be tied up all the time with his boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
“Oh<br />
<br />
“No, I mean literally tied up. He was reluctant to stick dildos up his ass so I’m making his boyfriend and him product testers.” Troy shrugged. “He’s working on Big Bad Tex’s test cock.”<br />
<br />
“Test…cock.” Tex mouthed. “That is a mouthful.”<br />
<br />
“Yes. It’s like, two inches in diameter.” Troy shrugged. “Anyways, back to the point: when do we leave?”<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow.” Tex shrugged. “Which means you’ll be shacking up with Daryl.” <br />
<br />
“Guard dog?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“And a certified emotional support animal. I know you want a quick fix, return to Rusty, but we’re still working on getting you and Rusty together again without breaking anything. It’s like repairing fine china.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to be some fat pig boyfriend or something, right, just a dog?” Troy wanted Tex to be clear with him.<br />
<br />
“The best trained dog on the planet.” Tex hesitated. “But, we’re doing an experiment. Crafting a megabeast. And I need the Familiar spell to control it.”<br />
<br />
“But if you release the Familiar spell, I’ll just be..” Troy trailed off.<br />
<br />
“A regular dog.” Tex swallowed. <br />
<br />
Troy hesitated, and stuck his head out the window, hoping the wind would clear his head. He was afraid.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even notice Tex cancel Familiar as they arrived at Daryl&#39;s farm.<br />
<br />
Troy&#39;s mind slowed to a crawl as he bound out of the truck and up into his Master&#39;s lap. The hog rubbed him happily. Troy snuffled and sniffed him, enjoying his Master&#39;s scent and laid on the ratty couch next to him while he watched the game. All his worries were forgotten. Master stroked his head and the dog sighed, content.<br />
<br />
Tex waved at Daryl and hurried to the meeting. They needed an ace in the hole and RK needed to figure out how to return Troy to his normal life. Tex hadn&#39;t realized what a blunder he&#39;d walked into by making Troy an actual dog.  In this reality, Troy was always a dog. Rusty was the owner of the Book of Beasts. He&#39;d erased him, essentially. Trying to pop him back into place as Rusty&#39;s boyfriend was going to cause massive Paradox.</p>
