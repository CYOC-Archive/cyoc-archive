<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Regret, Dan felt a foreboding feeling of responsibility for what he caused Ian to become, and his situation made worse, when Dan finished speaking the spell and changed a handsome satyr, to becoming then a buck goat.<br />
<br />
Dan wondered of just how much to Ian’s mind had endured the further physical transforming, as if he were mentally as all goat, or partially still as a rational thinking being?<br />
<br />
Even as Dan felt the pains from his body changing, becoming a Satyr, the chrome yellow colored eyes of his buck friend stared at Dan with an evil suggesting of an intention. “What, I said I was sorry, and sorry for me now as I was sorry for spellbinding you to being a goat.” Dan said, and even as he did his friend bleated several times as though he or it were speaking, trying to add a thought to their predicament.<br />
<br />
What Dan saw is what he knew he would be getting, as if his friend Ian had somehow known the correct words to finish the spell he had eaten. The wondrous change had aroused and instilled a personal want for passions similar to those practiced by buck goats. As had Ian, then Dan felt his heart beating faster and his breathing became as rapid. <br />
<br />
Dan smiled and then a frowned as he thought about what he knew was happening and how he wished it was happening in the privacy at home. He felt like his eyes would about pop as leg muscles rippled of drastic contorting, the spell making human tissue that of animal. An ache what Dan could not ignore began with his toes of their cramping, as he watched what looked like a black oozing jell seeping out of under each toenail.<br />
<br />
Then a screaming pain to Charlie-horse cramps hit, and what were five toes did merge, to become as two hoofs, cloven hoofs and a dewclaw; giving Dan a cloven hoof forming at the end to each foot. The legs pains were enraged then by his changing feet, they were growing, as all seemed similar to how Ian changed, but for Dan he felt horrid pains.<br />
<br />
Dan was sweating like a mare horse in heat and with one shaking hand he did swipe the dripping sweat from a aching forehead. Suddenly he felt of something sharp protruding from his forehead. Dan knew it was goat horns, but he had forgotten about what to expect.<br />
<br />
“Horns,” Dan said as if not really wanting them, the pointed as sharp feel of short horns growing out of his forehead, caused him to stand up straighter while his fears increased. &quot;Oh no, I never thought of,&quot; is what Dan you tried to say, but the words came out all jumbled up as lips suddenly could not form the correct manners of forming words anymore. As fear sent his hands to purse about his face, he felt it as covered in inch long fur, while his mouth, lips and nose had begun to merge, as if his changes were continuing, moving beyond him becoming a satyr, but as if he would join Ian as a big buck goat.<br />
<br />
Attentions taken to face, horns, and the lacked ability of speaking aroused an extreme horny desire for wanting something to shiver, shaking, as jutting from the end of his spine. Moaning of delight and mixed with quick pains and jolting muscle cramps, force Dan to look at those changing legs.<br />
<br />
Blinking with disbelief, he saw his feet had grown much longer and the cloven hooves are looking as if they were given to being his at birth. Dan lifted a still changing leg to give his hoofs a wiggle, as from some odd reason from having hoofs, tends to bring on a smile. He combed his fingers through growing locks of goat fur grown from his thighs. As with more arm movements Dan noted a stretching sensation, what makes him to moan as if stiffening?<br />
<br />
Arms suddenly made a horrific snap as they lock to extend out in front of his chest. Arms became aligned as if they were changing, becoming soon to being as his forelegs, and fingers which had moments ago touched at new horns, gained on each a black, hard, cube as if they would soon merge, forming another pair of cloven hoofs.<br />
<br />
The want for becoming a satyr was drastic enough of a changing self, but the idea of becoming wholly a male goat, an animal, was beyond belief. Dan shuddered at the thought of him standing on all fours was becoming a driving desire, he felt a pleasant feeling for liking more the contortion of self to stand as do goats. Shivers of new delights pulse down a still changing backbone as feelings of satisfied pleasures build and build.<br />
<br />
The Billy goat who was Ian did twist his head to look up, as if he wishing to greet a new member of his growing herd!<br />
<br />
Dan felt more care free feelings for the gaining of a life what seemed as euphoric of wonder. The new scents touch his changed sinus causing Dan to sniff, as smelling the rank scent of a Billy goat feeling aroused from watching a friend becoming a goat too!<br />
<br />
The absolute delight in what Dan was at that moment feeling caused his new tail to wiggle. The tail wiggling sends a sensation to cause Dan to crane his head with a longer neck, to peer past a shaggy furred shoulder to view the top half of his cute tail. Walking in circles, Dan eyed his changed and changing self, as he found comfort from becoming more as soon a animal, a buck goat.<br />
<br />
Thoughts became mixed with human rational and goat instincts, as Ian bleats his welcome, Dan sniffed the breeze for the scents of doe goats, of old nannies, he gaining a wanting desire to conquest, dominate, and rule over some female goat. The new as changing delighted desire for smelling of such female scents he would welcome, tickled to wishing he could smile, Dan thought about finding a nanny goat, but then there was Ian, as maybe he wouldn&#39;t care! <br />
<br />
Human moral teachings just flew out the window as animal lusts drive every part of Dan to better appreciating his new form. Rock hard was his male goat member stretching down below, Dan could feel it, if not see it, the fact of what he felt said it was there!<br />
<br />
Horny as hell and feeling the built up desire for release Dan’s mind goes wild with lust as he mounts Ian, and both stand stiff as waiting for the sensation from being joined.</p>
