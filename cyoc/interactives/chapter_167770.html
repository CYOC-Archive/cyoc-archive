<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tokyo&#39;s Horizon Offices shared many of the same goals and ideas that the company&#39;s main offices in the US had followed, and at times gained some notoriety in the realms of working with certain agricultural research that was sought to improve food production on the island nation of Japan and even looking for ways to improve fisheries and things like that. In some ways these projects worked similarly to how the Brown family had initially been contacted to look for a way to improve beef and milk production in the US for the main offices in Lyre, Nevada. However, the birth of Animalia had lead to a great many changes that soon reached out to every Horizon office, particularly when certain groups found the idea of being an Animalian intriguing. And Horizon&#39;s Tokyo offices had been no exception, and here, Dr. Miyamoto was able to look into ways to refine the Animalia Virus, make it easier to distribute, work with more animals, including those from the past, and looking into ways that would let the Animalia Virus naturally go inactive once a new Animalia had been dosed and thus wouldn&#39;t be reliant on yearly vaccines being administered.<br />
<br />
Though while he and Chel had been able to help get Project Mesozoic off the ground shortly after Heather Wilcox had demonstrated that that kind of Animalian transformation was possible, other elements of it had reached no conclusion. Dr. Miyamoto was depressed a bit on that, and would continue to work to find a way, but that would take time... and in some way time that the present global pandemic had also hurt. Unlike in the US, Horizon was able to work on a vaccine in its Tokyo offices and was cooperating with other Japanese medical companies that were working on a Covid vaccine there, though unlike the Russians and the Americans who were looking to rush a product to score political points, the Japanese effort had played heavily to a science lead model. And that was where Dr. Miyamoto had been doing most of his work, though not that things Animalia related didn&#39;t come up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you say he&#39;s come in under Project Phoenix?&quot; Doctor Miyamoto asked to a nurse as they walked along to a conversion room in the Tokyo office  that had been set up. <br />
<br />
Some things were a bit hit and miss with regard to conversions. Technically it would be legal for those that had pet friendly apartments in Tokyo, or for those outside the city, but for the moment until some of the major building renovations were completed to upgraded sizes, large modern animals and most prehistoric life wasn&#39;t going to be workable. Progress was being made before Covid hit, but for a time the virus slowed that progress. This in turn limited the number of conversions in the Tokyo office Most of those that wanted to be Animalians ultimately went to Heiya Island, but there were some times where someone came into the Horizon offices in Tokyo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the nurse answered in Japanese, &quot;though from all the reports.... I&#39;m surprised he hasn&#39;t come in sooner, given his age, cancers, and the lingering effects of radiation sickness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Miyamoto nodded as the reports on the request came it. It was made by an elderly man with the help a senior center that he had been living in. The man wasn&#39;t fully in mental decline or anything, but they&#39;d found that because of his age and arthritis, managing the cancers that had plagued the man through his life was getting more difficult and with no living family, he at times needed help to handle things that needed being done. Though because of other details in his life, the staff that cared for the man had also seemed to call him &quot;lucky,&quot; and largely for the fact of surviving both atomic bomb strikes in 1945. Though, Doctor Miyamoto didn&#39;t find it all that lucky, as yes, the man survived, but he&#39;d lost his whole family, suffered from radiation poisoning, and had developed cancers that were requiring a lot of treatment just to keep at bay. This cancers hadn&#39;t killed him, but that didn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t troublesome. And as a result of this, Doctor Miyamoto figured that the man would have converted the moment Project Phoenix proved it could cure those afflictions. Though he guessed there was something of a lone wolf nature to his personality, especially when related to the animal he&#39;d selected to convert to.<br />
<br />
&quot;He may have had concerns on where to live... as until Chel was uplifted, we didn&#39;t have many areas in Tokyo that would allow for Animalians,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto sighed, trying to reason through why a man who wanted to go through the conversion waited as long as he had, &quot;or the staff that was caring for him didn&#39;t have the funds to fly him to Heiya Island to be converted there... or maybe something happened that just changed his mind. It could be any of those things... and regardless of our surprise... I suppose it would be inappropriate to be too nosy. He will tell us if he wishes to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are curious?&quot; the nurse asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto chuckled.<br />
<br />
The two then made their way in to the conversion room to find an elderly man seated on a bed with a different nurse with him. This other nurse wore a different uniform, and was likely connected with the senior center that the man lived at. The man looked with baggy eyes and glasses that covered them, with only wisps of silver-gray hair on the sides of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will... make me... whole again?&quot; the man asked in a weak and pained voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will cure your cancers, sir and will restore your youth,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto assured him as the nurse with him readied the alcohol swab, &quot;though it will also turn you into an Animalian... a black furred wolf, as you requested with your paperwork.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it would be better than the anti cancer drugs?&quot; the man asked slowly and gave a cough in the end. The nurse that had come with him did her best to steady him to make sure he remained seated and didn&#39;t fall over.<br />
<br />
&quot;In my opinion, yes,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered, &quot;for as an Animalian, you would not lose anything that would prevent you from functioning in society and without all the pain and cancer issues... you could get a restart as it were. Something that the bombs robbed you off...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man gave a small smile while the nurse that was with him began to roll up one sleeve on his shirt so that Doctor Miyamoto&#39;s nurse could then use the alcohol swab there. Doctor Miyamoto, himself, however, had the actual Animalia Virus doses in a plastic box that was small enough to fit in the pockets of his lab coat, and was part of Horizon&#39;s procedures to make sure no samples of the virus were ever stolen. The doctor took the smile a sign of confidence and hope, which was always a good thing, though he did move on to other issues that would have to be addressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... you will be aware that given your age, that conversion into an Animalian could also trigger Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder... do you understand this?&quot; Doctor Miyamoto asked carefully. The man nodded before he continued, &quot;and should you develop the condition after conversion... do you have a preferred therapist that could be familiar with the condition or at least capable of handling the condition?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not by name... but our facility does have contacts with some therapists in the area around Nagasaki and others have connections with friends or family that went to Heiya Island earlier to convert,&quot; the nurse that had come with the man spoke respectfully for him, &quot;and as per the agreement with his conversion request, we will see to either what can be established or to his transport to Heiya Island, if need be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... that will be acceptable,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered, &quot;I will deliver the injections and give the man time to transform in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In private...&quot; the nurse began to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;The transformation is not painful,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered, &quot;and with certain species... they will find themselves larger than they were before converting... particularly with animals larger than Humans. Though there have been cases where the transformation becomes arousing and if you remain... you could end up finding yourself converted as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the nurse answered as she finally stood up and allowed Doctor Miyamoto access to deliver the injections.<br />
<br />
Doctor Miyamoto delivered them and then shepherded the other two women out the door and then shut the door behind him. He turned first to his own nurse to relay the next set of instructions.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will need one dose of the Animalia Virus vaccine, and possibly a change of clothes,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto spoke to his nurse who nodded and then moved on quickly while he remained in front of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;He really wouldn&#39;t go after me like some bad animated tentacle porn monster, would he?&quot; the nurse asked nervously would he.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mindlessly... no,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto answered, &quot;No.  He wouldn&#39;t lose himself to violence or lust. Particularly if you went over the animal instincts wolves have and prepared him for them. But given that Animalians will already have a high libido naturally... if he does develop Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder... he could be a little bit more forward with it that what would be expected from an Animalian. And given that as a Gray Wolf Animalian... he could be a bit taller and more muscular than he was as a Human, his clothes might not survive the transformation. Thus regardless of whether or not he has Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder... both you and he could end up being uncomfortable as a result of him being... naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; the senior center nurse answered, &quot;and you&#39;re certain he&#39;ll be okay until after the transformation is completed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Horizon has converted plenty of elder people... not all of which develop Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder,&quot; Doctor Miyamoto explained, &quot;and a few that had conditions and issues similar to &quot;Lucky&quot; as you&#39;ve called him, and have recovered with no physical difficulty during the transformation. How his mind responds depends more on what the cancers he&#39;s had has done to his mind...&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse sighed as they waited for a few moments while they waited for the man&#39;s transformation to finish. After a few moments there came a howl from within the room and shortly after that there came a soft pawing at the wooden door. It wasn&#39;t as heavy and &quot;armored&quot; as the doors in Animalia or Dino City&#39;s Horizon offices, but withing the main Japanese Home Islands, until some of the apartment reconstruction projects were finished to accommodate Animalians that were larger than Humans by a good size, like Miko Monaka the Gigantoraptor Dinotopian, was completed. The pawing was enough to let Doctor Miyamoto know that the transformation had completed.<br />
<br />
He opened the door slightly to see young and strong looking black furred Wolf Animalian. He was slightly larger than expected for a Gray Wolf Animalian, but not as big as Leon, the Dire Wolf Animalian, but still big.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello...&quot; the new Wolf Animalian said in Japanese, &quot;I believe I am in need of new clothes... and after all the news about the Alpha Female on Heiya Island... I believe I would also be in need of fur friendly paint... and white colored paint.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Doctor Miyamoto wondered, as he heard his nurse coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking,&quot; the Wolf Animalian slowly, &quot;she is a white furred wolf with red painted brush marks... and calls herself Ami. I am black furred... why not paint white brush marks and call myself Tsukuyomi. My parents named me Tsuku anyway.... Oh, and tell nurse Manami thank you for all the kindness she&#39;s shown me over the years. I wouldn&#39;t have gotten this far without her.&quot;</p>
