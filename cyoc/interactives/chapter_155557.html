<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was looking out of the kitchen window, a part of him was terrified of what could be happening to him. With Dakota he had a fantasy of strange proportions. Dakota was his lover, at the time he thought about wearing dresses, and make up, even he was wearing a daisy crown, but......... He was a man!<br />
<br />
His body said otherwise however, his jet black nipples were always erect, dripping breast milk. His body had changed for sure, this was obviously a given. He now realized the cruel sick joke of it all, his body, the breast size, the way his body had been altered..... He looked like his mom!<br />
<br />
This was something Melissa had said yesterday, and he could see it! His face was still a man&#39;s, his hair was still short, but that was about it. It wasn&#39;t like he was becoming a morph of his mom, or something like that. He resembled his mom because he was becoming a woman! What if James was born a girl, instead of a boy? This was his new reality, this is why he resembled his mom before she got to the cabin!<br />
<br />
&quot;When she was pregnant with me, her breasts were probably the same size as mine right now&quot;, James pulled his sundress down, and looked down at his cleavage, he could see his black nipples poking out of his sundress. James was still in denial, and at least for now; refused that he was pregnant. His body was so smooth now also. James pulled his sundress back up, and went to the fridge. He walked over to the fridge, and opened it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really they took all the food?&quot;, James was a little agitated that Henry had took all the Veggies again. It had been 4 days since Joan had her chat with Melissa. &quot;Fine then, some cereal will do&quot;, while James was becoming a horse, he still had the stomach for other foods as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch, chicken shit&quot;, James howled as he sat down, James after this entire time has not actually sat down once. That might sound preposterous, but ever since his experience with Dakota, it was like his brain was rewired to never sit down. He normally squatted down, stood, or layed down, never actually sitting. His leathery horse vagina was in pain.<br />
<br />
Going bathroom was the one other time he would actually sit, but there was no pain when he did. His penis was actually useless now, as he could only urinate with his vagina. It was like the cabin rewarded him for sitting, and doing his business like a woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine cabin you win&quot;, James got up, and ate standing up. Thoughts lingered in his mind though, he could go on all fours and eat like a animal....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How is my son doing? Or do you prefer daughter?&quot;, Joan walked into the kitchen , it sounded like Joan was mocking James, but she actually didn&#39;t know what to call him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, Im a guy, so ya......&quot;, James was blushing, and obviously very nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey..Bleat... This is the one place you can truly find happiness. Don&#39;t..Bleat.. Hide your own desires&quot;, Joan of course said this with her own intentions in mind also. Getting into Melissa&#39;s pants was her first priority, but even with her own desires, she still loved James, and gave him the best advice she could give.  <br />
<br />
James was still shocked at his own mom, she had a goat muzzle, and she was completely naked, her udders, and even that nice pudgy cock of hers......<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you embarrassed mom?&quot;, James could feel his arousal building up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No James&quot;, Joan walked up to him. Joan was still smaller than him, this just meant that she would need to lean up to kiss him. Joan kissed James right on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry said something about needing some help with the barn, you should help him&quot;, Joan gave him an animalistic kiss, more of a parting gift than a sexual endeavor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll do that&quot;, If Joan didn&#39;t stop to speak, James was just about to squeeze his Mom&#39;s ass, and who knows what would have happened after that. James quickly turned around, and headed for the cabin door.<br />
<br />
Joan could smell his sons arousal, she didn&#39;t want to change him any further. She could only stare at his ass as he walked away, it was filling up the complete backside of his dress. He was swaying his butt seductively. He didn&#39;t even know he was doing it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye my son&quot;, She whispered this. Joan felt like this was the last time she would ever see her son again. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Frick, its getting colder out&quot;, James was freezing the minute he walked outside. It was getting colder, the barn would be warmer though. James walked into the open barn door, this was the second time he has entered this building.<br />
<br />
&quot;So thats the milking machine....&quot;, James walked up to the contraption.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this tube would go..... Where exactly?&quot;, James completely bended over as he examined the device. James was obviously not a farmer, and had never worked with this equipment before.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey Jam.............&quot;, Henry walked into the barn from cutting wood, and could only stare at his sons vagina, horse tail was erect, this caused the dress to be raised higher than it should be. Henry could even see James&#39;s thick thighs, and ass. Henry&#39;s cow balls began to twitch, cock was also erect. James&#39;s vagina also looked like what a cows would probably look like..............<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, dad is this what you wanted help with?&quot;, James was blissfully unaware of the show he was giving his father!<br />
<br />
Henry has never had a sexual interaction with James..... Was that about to change?</p>
