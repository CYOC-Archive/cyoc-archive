<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Morgan had pulled into work, she had decided to be Cat Scratch Fever&#39;s Typhoid Mary, creating rubber bimbo kitties everywhere she went. While she was infected, she was not infectious. But the little skin fragment floating in her bottle was a different story, even now the water in that bottle should have enough of a viral load to infect hundreds.<br />
<br />
She scanned into the building and went first to the coffee station. A quick slide down on the brewing temperature (to avoid killing the virus), a splash from her bottle into the coffee maker&#39;s water reservoir,  and she walked away knowing at least a quarter of the office would be infected by lunch time.<br />
<br />
At her desk, she had a little spray bottle of water she used to clean her monitors. A quick dump and refill from her bottle, and she had a handy virus spreading tool. Morgan wandered the building, and at every opportunity where no one was looking, sprayed  handles and other frequently touched surfaces. <br />
<br />
She now resolved to target a few people who had already gotten on her bad side in the limited time she had worked there.<br />
<br />
First was Rasheed, their QA tester, who didn&#39;t seem to understand what &#39;Morgan is a lesbian&#39; meant and relentlessly hit on her.<br />
<br />
&#39;Morgan! You are looking hot and feisty today, rwwww!&#39; The sexist pig said as she walked over to his cube. She ignored this, and started asking some questions about their project. While he was distracted by her (and trying to look down her shirt), she quick sprayed his cell phone screen with the virus laden water. Satisfied that the bastard would soon be switching sides in the war of the sexes, she moved on to her next target.<br />
<br />
Amy was the office manager, and a dedicated political activist. On Morgan&#39;s first day, Amy had tried to get Morgan to come with her to come to an upcoming LBGTQIA+ event. Morgan had explained that while she appreciated such groups, she just wasn&#39;t an activist. Amy took it on as a mission to recruit and convince Morgan, and had been bombarding her with messages by phone, email, and facebook many times each day. Morgan sprayed her hands before helping herself to something from the candy jar on Amy&#39;s desk. Knowing the woman&#39;s sweet tooth, this was sure to get her infected within the hour.<br />
<br />
Knowing it was only a matter of time before this place was ground zero for more shiny anthro amazons, she thought about grabbing a few things from her desk. She stopped herself. She was on borrowed time herself, the smallest cut would have her shedding her old self and the sentiments that she carried. The new Morgan would be strong, uninhibited, and live a simple life of sexual excess. Dumb horny rubber kitty Morgan wouldn&#39;t care about some boring old photos.<br />
<br />
Morgan went out to her car and waited. An hour passed, and she realized that cuts in an office setting might be common enough, but it still might be as much as a few days. Then she saw Thomas, one of the other developers, walking out to his car. She remembered Thomas was diabetic - and had to check is blood sugar levels frequently. If she had managed to infect him, the needle poke of his glucose test should unleash the SkinSplit beast waiting inside him.<br />
<br />
Morgan&#39;s arousal burned at the thought of what might be about to happen. Her hands slid inside her panties.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t disappointed. Thomas was in his car barely more than a minute before throwing the door open and falling out. He clutched his right wrist with his left hand. With a sound like a balloon popping, his right hand burst into tatters, a catcher&#39;s mitt sized white paw swelling out from inside. His face was one of surprise, and not pain. Morgan knew that the change quickly started feeling good as the mental changes kicked in. He pulled himself back up, his arms braced on the hood of his car, his back to Morgan. His left hand tore apart as a big rubber paw formed inside.<br />
<br />
The changes accelerated, a thick white feline tail pushing out between his pants and shirt, whipping back and forth as it grew. His shoes burst as his feet surrendered to digitigrade paws. He rose, his khaki pants straining at the seams as they fought to contain the powerful, thick thighed legs inside. Huge handpaws grabbed at the sides of his face and pulled as he moaned in pleasure. That moan changed to a roar has his face tore down the middle, a shining white lioness revealed underneath.  Powerful arms pulled, and the remaining human skin pulled away from the new feline&#39;s body. Morgan came, brought over the edge by her desire for what she had just witness and her own busy fingers.<br />
<br />
With a few last pulses and surges, the lioness&#39;s body finished its growth. Well over seven feet tall, she was powerfully built with broad muscled shoulders, wide hips, and powerful bulging thighs. Her chest was dominated by two huge tits larger than her head, defying conventional sizing. They stood out proud and firm, with aqua color nipples. Her eyes, lips, and paw pads matched her nipples. Her venus mound was prominent, her sex ready.<br />
<br />
The lioness locked eyes with Morgan and charged. The goth girl slammed her car in drive, knowing what would happen if she was caught. Morgan wanted to infect far more than just her office, and if the lioness caught her, she would certainly join her as a feline sex fiend. <br />
<br />
The lioness almost caught her. She could hear a deep feminine voice from behind repeating &#39;Tammy want to fuck! Tammy want to fuck!&#39;</p>
