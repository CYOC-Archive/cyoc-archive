<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following Rei and Nats misadventures at the mall, the two teens quickly made their way to Rei&#39;s house. Quickly stepping inside, the two girls now tried to quietly make their way to Rei&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reiko how was the mall?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei and Nat paused, glancing into the kitchen as they noticed Mrs. Tomizawa. Mrs. Tomizawa, or Hanako, was a rather exotic looking woman in her mid forties. Despite her shoulder length hair being streaked with grey she possessed a rather trim figure with a face that could pass for someone in their 30s. &quot;Um fun mom,&quot; Rei stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will Natalia be staying for dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Rei replied, her answer coming out as more of a question than an answer. Hanako now stepped forward, a warm smile etched on her beautiful face. &quot;Okay I&#39;ll just let Marisa know,&quot; she smiled. &quot;You girls have fun and try to keep thw noise down please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei and Nat simply nodded, quickly sprinting for the bedroom before closing the door. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe your mom isn&#39;t worried about the two of us being alone upstairs,&quot; Nat stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom knows nothing is going to happen,&quot; Rei replied. &quot;But don&#39;t change the subject. What happened out there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I um used the ring,&quot; Nat replied sheepishly. Rei simply furrowed her brow, casting her girlfriend a critical look. &quot;I know that,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;You turned Cathy into a kindergartener. She went from Social Security to Sesame Street quick. Why you make her so young?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was an accident okay,&quot; Nat groaned. &quot;I was kinda shocked when it happened.&quot; Nat now removed the ring, placing it on Rei&#39;s nightstand. Both teens now hovering over it, staring at it anxiously like it could explode at any moment. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe it worked,&quot; Nat muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I can&#39;t believe we have memories of Cathy,&quot; Rei added. &quot;I mean its crazy! I remember all the times we&#39;ve babysat for her. I even remember her parents paying us really well each time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same, &quot; Nat answered. Gazing at the ring, the damphir teen now bit her lip apprehensively. Vampires and the supernatural were one thing. A ring that could change a person&#39;s age and alter reality was completely different. &quot;Rei we should give it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What! No way,&quot; Rei exclaimed. &quot;I didn&#39;t even get a turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But its dangerous Rei,&quot; Nat countered. Rei scoffed, casting her girlfriend an annoyed look. &quot;That is so not fair. I should get to try it at least once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat now began to fidget in place, she had enough knowledge of the supernatural world to know messing around with all powerful items was a bad idea. Still, she didn&#39;t want to hurt Rei&#39;s feelings, especially when she had a point. &quot;Okay fine,&quot; she sighed. &quot;One time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei now squealed with delight, squeezing her damphir girlfriend tightly before snatching the ring. &quot;You what the problem is,&quot; she stated. &quot;We probably should write down spells or something. You know, like a book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A spell book,&quot; Nat replied dimly. &quot;Rei we simply wish on this thing and besides its a one time only thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just saying,&quot; Rei shrugged. Nat sighed, already a feeling of dread washing over her. Somehow she had a feeling Rei was going to try this more than once.<br />
<br />
As Nat now worried, Rei pondered who to test the ring out on. There was always her mom. Rei had been told stories about how beautiful her mother had been in her youth. Rei&#39;s father, Frank, had been on a business trip when he met her. Hanako had been working as a model at the time with a part time gig as a waitress for business parties. When the two had met, Frank immediately fell in love. Unfortunately for him, he was a bit clumsy and shy.  Inspite of his missteps, and awkward mannerisms Hanako was charmed by him. The two quickly fell in love, dating and then marrying before moving back to the states.<br />
<br />
As much fun as it would be to see what her mother looked like at her age, Rei dismissed the idea. Being the same age as her mom just didn&#39;t seem right. Glancing out her window, Rei smiled as she spied her elderly neighbors in the backyard. &quot;Hey Nat look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat now glanced out the window, spying Miles and Miranda Desoto. The elderly couple were in their 60s and quite friendly despite the Tomizawa only recently moving in. &quot;What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just watch,&quot; Rei smirked as the ring began to glow.Nat now anxiously gazed at the Desoto&#39;s, her stomach churning anxiously as she watched the elderly Hispanic couple grow younger. <br />
<br />
The changes were subtle at first, Miranda and Miles hair growing darker, returning to its original dark brown as their wrinkles began to vanish. By the time the couple reached their 40s, Nat beheld a middle aged couple that appeared to be in much better health.<br />
<br />
Miles hair was darkening, his hairline slowly pushing forward. As that occurred, she could see his body beginning to strengthen, his muscular biceps and chest expanding with youth and vigor.<br />
<br />
Miranda changes were just as amazing. the elderly womans posture straightening, her breasts regain their firmness and losing their sag. Even her body began to tone, losing the lumpy shape of the elderly.<br />
<br />
Passing 40 and racing for 30, Miles and Miranda continued to change. Tbeir skin tone evened, their muscle firmed and expanded, their hair grew out and radiated youth. Soon two very attractive and athletic looking 30 year olds were standing in the backyard. The two looking closer to newlyweds than an ageing married couple.<br />
<br />
Still the changes persisted, Nat growing nervous as the couple descended through their 20s. Miranda&#39;s body continued to thin, her stomach flattening as her curves grew impossibility sharp. Now the woman looked barely old enough to drink, her body amazingly curvy yet her face was rounding appearing quite youthful in comparison to her incredible body.<br />
<br />
Miles too looked much younger, his muscles thinning yet becoming more defined. Nat glanced at the man finding that he appeared much less bulky but possessed a lean body that looked  like it had been carves from marble. Ironically though his face was baby smooth. When Rei had cast the spell, Miles had sported a five o clock shadow. Now, he looked like he could go a day or two without shaving. His face rounding, his cheeks soft as his eyes seemed to brighten with youthful vitality.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re um getting kinda youn now Rei,&quot; Nat whispered in alarm. Rei turned, giving her girlfriend a knowing winner as the couple grew younger.<br />
<br />
Descending into their teens, Rei and Nat watched as Miles and Miranda continued to change. The couples bodies grew thinner, their faces growing rounder and more innocent as they reentered high school.<br />
<br />
Miles face was now rounding in appearance, his height decreasing as his muscles began to thin. Dropping below 16 and becoming 15, Rei and Nat now noticed a skinny teen with thick hair and a bright smile. It appeared that Miles had been a bit of a late bloomer. The teenage boy having a round face without a trace of facial hair. Still, the two girls had to admit that the Puerto Rican boy was quite handsome.<br />
<br />
Miranda too now became 15. Unlike Miles though, it appeared she had been given an early gift by nature. Sporting a pair of near C cup breasts, Miranda was absolutely gorgeous. Possessing the curves of a college student with a skinny teenage waist and stomach, it was obvious that she would be every teenage boys desire. Glancing at her tan skin, long luxurious hair and perfect skin both Rei and Nat felt their faces flush as they admired the teenage beauty.<br />
<br />
As the spell stopped, Rei and Nat now felt new memories flood their minds. Instead of an elderly couple, Miranda and Miles were twins. Both were Freshman like Rei and Nat and much to the girls surprise were on friendly terms with the girls.<br />
<br />
Miles was a musician, the teenage boy a prodigy with both drums and the guitar. Originally having a crush on Natalia, his feelings quickly turned from romantic to friendly. The reason for this was Miranda, his twin sister. <br />
<br />
Despite Miranda&#39;s gorgeous appearance, the girl was painfully shy. Often dressing in baggy clothes, the teen worried that her breasts were too big or that she wasn&#39;t as pretty as some of the other girls. Why the teenage beauty thought this completely baffled the two teens but the quickly discovered that Miranda was a genuinely friendly and kind person. Until Rei had moved into town, Miranda had been Nat&#39;s closest friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap,&quot; the teens whispered. Glancing down at the twins, they could see them enjoying the sunny day. Miles practicing his guitar as Miranda worked on her flower garden in a long sundress. Rei now turned to Nat, a smile like a Cheshire cat on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon Nat let&#39;s go talk with our friends.&quot;</p>
