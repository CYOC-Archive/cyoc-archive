<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor breathed a heavy sigh of relief as he made it to his truck. It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t like or wasn&#39;t interested in Melissa. She was quite beautiful, even if she wasn&#39;t &quot;built&quot; the way female weres were built. However, Melissa had told him that she didn&#39;t want to have sex or enter were society just for the sake of &quot;doing it.&quot; She wanted it to feel right and she wanted it to be romantic, as it would be her first time. However, with the heavy scent of sex presently in the Jenkins house and the sound of two weretigers furiously mating behind it, he knew that if he stayed there, the temptation would be too great to turn Melissa, which wouldn&#39;t be what she said she wanted. The tightness in his pants was more than enough to alert him that his own senses were driving toward that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Mel,&quot; Trevor whispered as he began to drive away from the Jenkins home, &quot;But... I want it to be because it&#39;s right and that you truly want it. I don&#39;t want you to think that I can&#39;t control myself and that.... and that you&#39;d turn away from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He returned home to find that things were calm, or at least as calm as could be in his family as his sister was the first to greet him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, T!&quot; Anna Bell said to him in a happy voice as Trevor came in through the front door. She then looked around him and noticed that he&#39;d come back alone, &quot;You didn&#39;t bring your girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor noticed that Anna Bell&#39;s greeting alerted his brother, Clint, and his father, Jacob. They had been watching television in the living room and both turned to look to Trevor as he stood just inside the entryway with Anna Bell standing nearby looking a bit disappointed that he didn&#39;t bring Melissa back with him. He could soon hear footsteps, which let him know that his mother, Erma, had heard Anna Bell&#39;s comment and was on her way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was only a picnic date,&quot; Trevor said to Anna Bell, &quot;We didn&#39;t have any exact plan for anything more than a picnic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said you liked her,&quot; Anna Bell commented, &quot;I wanted to meet her, say hi, and give her hugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I would like an opportunity to talk with her and her father,&quot; Jacob spoke from the couch, &quot;as she didn&#39;t stay here long enough the other day for us to be properly introduced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor slowly nodded. When he&#39;d brought Melissa up, she&#39;d only stayed long enough to talk with his mom, but Melissa Jenkins had come up fairly frequently over the past few days, usually at dinner. There was just something special about her that had made him want to be with her and make her happy and to do things right by her. She might not be built the way female weres were built, at present, but looks weren&#39;t everything and simply being well built didn&#39;t necessarily make things more desirable. Melissa had warm eyes and her red hair framed her face perfectly and when she smiled, it was like Trevor could see in her... true beauty. He&#39;d mentioned this, in addition to the bond that had been forming between them at school, and from that his family had figured out that he&#39;d found someone he liked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure we could arrange something... we&#39;ll probably see each other again at the Halloween dance tomorrow,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can arrange a big family dinner... though you should know that her father has become a weretiger and we&#39;d need more to feed him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can be done,&quot; Jacob spoke as he got up and came toward him.<br />
<br />
As his father approached, his mother had arrived as well. Jacob slowly moved to one side and ushered Anna Bell toward the living room and gave the offer that she join Clint in watching television. She frowned but did go along with it. Trevor waited until Anna Bell had joined Clint on the couch before he answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;ll be good,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;He does seem like a pretty good guy and is adjusting well to everything that&#39;s happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
His parents both nodded, as they knew about the fight between Virginia McCoy and Alice Decrux being Harold Jenkins&#39;s point of entry into were-society. It was only what would be printed in the Moon Lake city paper and so on, but it was enough to know that while Harold Jenkins didn&#39;t have the best of entrances into were-society.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how did it go, dear?&quot; Erma asked him, &quot;You did treat her right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did my best, mom,&quot; Trevor answered as he moved toward the kitchen with his parents following, &quot;and I think things went pretty good. She&#39;s... she&#39;s definitely the woman I&#39;d like to spend my life with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so long as you don&#39;t force yourself on her,&quot; Jacob Tyson said firmly, &quot;She doesn&#39;t have to become a werecow if she doesn&#39;t want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... I think that she does want to,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;but... well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, son?&quot; Erma asked him as he sat down at the kitchen table. She and Jacob moved to stand nearby and looking down to their son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, anything between us... would be HER first time,&quot; Trevor answered slowly and nervously, &quot;I promised her I wouldn&#39;t force anything and would make her first time romantic when the time is right... as since her father is already her family&#39;s were, she&#39;s not under any pressure become a were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is the right thing to do,&quot; Jacob said with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Trevor agreed and then looked down for a moment, &quot;But... the thing is... neither of us really know when the right moment is and... well... how can I make the moment romantic if I don&#39;t know when it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor didn&#39;t hear an immediate answer and looked up to see his parents looking to each other for a moment. Eventually his father moved to pull a chair over so that he could sit beside his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;The right moment can&#39;t be &quot;made&quot; romantic,&quot; Jacob said to Trevor, &quot;you can plan something out that is romantic, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;d be the right moment. And it could even betray signs that you&#39;re wanting a sexual encounter. Just be friendly and yourself. The &quot;right&quot; moment will come on its own, and if you remain the bright and respecting young man your mother and I have raised, it will be a romantic moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor slowly nodded and continued to listen as his mother as she picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if she likes you... and from what I saw when you brought her up, it did look like she does, she will understand,&quot; Erma said to her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but getting to that could be a bit difficult,&quot; Trevor spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how is that?&quot; Erma asked her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... her father has been adapting well to being a weretiger,&quot; Trevor began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Under the circumstances,&quot; Jacob spoke in correction, &quot;because of that fight between McCoy and Decrux.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which was Decrux&#39;s fault,&quot; Erma spoke with some visible irritation, &quot;She was shameless at the city Fourth of July picnic last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know my eyes are only for you, dear,&quot; Jacob said to Erma.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and that&#39;s why I love you,&quot; Erma smiled to her husband, &quot;but that raccoon was still shameless, if you ask me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Trevor cut in, as the discussion of an incident the previous Fourth of July got away from the subject at hand, &quot;Melissa&#39;s father is adapting well and has fallen for Virginia McCoy. Melissa tells me that she thinks he was starting to fall for her before the fight, and with Ms. McCoy recently cleared of any wrong doing... the two of them have spent much of the day enjoying each other&#39;s company...&quot;<br />
<br />
Erma and Jacob looked to each other with some realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;And new weres can often be overcome with their new libido and new weres in love with the were that turned them... especially so,&quot; Erma said slowly with a glance to Jacob and remembered their own courtship.<br />
<br />
&quot;The scent of sex was so strong that I had all I could do leave without letting things get out of control,&quot; Trevor said slowly. &quot;It... it left me feeling quite eager... and I think it even had Melissa aroused... but it didn&#39;t feel right at that moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that would be right to do,&quot; Erma commented, &quot;but you did tell Melissa that you wanted to wait for the right moment to come up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I reminded her that I&#39;d promised to do that, yes,&quot; Trevor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she understood that you did so because you love her?&quot; Erma asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so... I don&#39;t know for sure,&quot; Trevor admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then tomorrow, you make sure,&quot; Jacob said to him, &quot;You&#39;ll have all day before the Halloween dance. You don&#39;t want to let the love of your life not know that you love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Trevor gave a weak smile.</p>
