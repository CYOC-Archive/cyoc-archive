<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Aaron entered the room he was surprised to find the girl in nothing more than a string bikini, admiring herself in the mirror.  Aaron saw that she was even bigger than he had imagined.  She was just 5 feet tall, but she had huge biceps and very thick thighs.  She flexed, sending ripples down her quads.  Her stomach was ripped, with a prominent six pack.  He breasts were small, but her broad chest muscles made them pop out.  Her neck was thick , with a wide traps.  And her whole body was a deep bronze.<br />
<br />
She turned and looked at Aaron.  &quot;Hey, beautiful.   Like what you see?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
In truth, he did not.  He liked women, very feminine women. And she looked too much like a man for his taste. She could sense his disappointment, and began to gather her clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if you are not interested, it is okay.  Your friend there just made you sound so sexy I couldn&#39;t resist giving it a shot.  But if this is just some kind of sick game between you two,  then I&#39;ll leave now  before it gets any weirder,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please stay,&quot; said Aaron.  &quot;I am a lesbian.  I have just never seen someone as big as you, much less done anything with them.  I am just a little nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl smiled.  &quot;Don&#39;t be.  I must admit, I am a little intimidated by you.  I have never been with someone as beautiful as you.  And so tall.  Let&#39;s just say the girls I usually end up with are a little more butch.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both giggled a little.  The girl sat down on the bed, and patted it, motioning for Aaron to join her. &quot;Why don&#39;t we sit down on the bed and get to know each other a little bit better? My name is Gina, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron sat down beside her. &quot;I&#39;m Erin.  Pleased to meet you, &quot; said Aaron, holding out his hand to shake.<br />
<br />
Gina chuckled, and took his hand.  &quot;Well, Erin, why don&#39;t you lay down, and let me be the one to break the ice?&quot; <br />
<br />
Aaron laid down, and Gina pulled off his clothes. &quot;Ohh, very nice, &quot; said Gina, as she ran her rough hands across his breast and chest. She trailed her hands down to his crotch, and smiled seductively.  She began to lick his cunt earnestly, thrusting her tongue inside, and twisting it around her swollen clit.  It had the desired effect.  His nipples sprang to attention.  Aaron began to moan in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Although Aaron was excited, he was still not attracted to Gina.  He tried to concentrate and swap something with her, but there was just nothing that he found that he wanted from her.  He felt himself on the verge of an orgasm, and he knew he had to hurry.  Gina was sure to break contact after he came.  He looked over her body.  The girl was clearly obsessed with muscles and working out.  Maybe if he took just a little of that desire for power, he would want to get some of her muscles.<br />
<br />
It was getting hard to think.  He was so close to release, and Gina was working him at a feverish pace.  But he concentrated, and wished to have some of her muscle worship.  He didn&#39;t feel anything, so he concentrated harder, pulling more of that need for muscle into his mind.  Suddenly he was assaulted by images of muscular women, each more beautiful in his mind than the last.  The bigger, the better.  The stronger, the better.  He knew it was wrong, but it was turning him on so much he didn&#39;t want it to stop.  These thoughts increased the excitement, and he came with a mixture of conflicting feelings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, &quot; said Gina.  &#39;That was intense.  I have never seen somebody so receptive.&quot; <br />
<br />
Aaron looked down at her and smiled.  Her muscles looked so good, so beautiful.  He didn&#39;t know why he hadn&#39;t seen it that way before.  She was perfect.  Aaron sat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You turn now, &quot; said Aaron, as he guided her to switch positions.  Aaron removed her bikini and saw a surprisingly large clit.  He guessed that it was the result of hormones or steroids or something.  But he didn&#39;t care.  All he cared about was her muscle.  &quot;Now close your eyes and lean back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina complied.  Aaron placed his hands on her thighs.  Her thick, strong thighs.  He began to dart his tongue into her pussy, wishing that he had some of her muscle.  He felt his own thighs begin to expand, getting thicker with well-defined muscles.  His arms felt tight, and his biceps muscle bulged and stretched his skin. The pleasure of his growth was intense.  He understood why Laruen had lost control and took so much from him earlier.  It was even better than an orgasm.  He knew that she only wanted him to take a little.  But it felt so good.  And it was making him look good.  There was nothing wrong with getting a little muscle on his frame.  So he wished for more.<br />
<br />
Energy flowed more rapidly into his body.  He could feel it expanding, stretching larger.  His abs became a tight six pack.  His ass deflated a little as it became more toned. His traps crept up his neck.  It felt fantastic, but he wanted more.  He wanted it all.  He refocused, and more of the wonderful energy flooded into his body.<br />
<br />
Gina felt weak.  She opened her eyes, and stared in shock at the Amazon growing below her.  She would have been excited - the woman was beautiful - but she saw that her own arms were much smaller, almost the size of a young boy.  It was obvious that she was stealing her strength.   She struggled to push her off, but the girl held tight to her thighs, continuing to stimulate her cunt orally.  Even though she was shrinking, she still felt great.  It was like her crotch was on fire.  It was almost worth it to experience that pleasure.  For some strange reason, she almost didn&#39;t miss her muscles.  They made her look ugly, like too much like a man.  She was happy to be rid of them, so she could be pretty again.  She suddenly came, and the Amazon finally let go, allowing her to enjoy the spasms of her orgasm alone. She screamed in pure bliss.<br />
<br />
Lauren burst into the room, worried by the screams she had heard.  She was shocked to find Aaron examining himself in the mirror.  He was clearly more muscular.  But his taller body spread the muscles more thinly, and he looked more like a fitness instructor than a bodybuilder.  Gina&#39;s body, on the other hand, hand had shrunk down to almost nothing.  She looked like a petite 5 foot tall girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron, what have you done?&quot; asked Lauren.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, &quot; said Gina, as she gathered up her clothes. &quot;I don&#39;t mind. I think I look better this way.  I don&#39;t like too much muscle.   It&#39;s not sexy.  So, thanks for the ride, but I don&#39;t think I want to be with you again. You are a little too butch for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina left the house quickly.  Lauren glared at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to her?  You were only supposed to take a little, &quot; said Lauren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, relax.  I was just having a little fun.  Experimenting, just like you said.  Besides, she didn&#39;t seem to mind, &quot; said Aaron. <br />
<br />
He turned and looked at Lauren with envy.  He was big, but Lauren was much bigger.  He wished he had some of her impressive strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to be that big! It&#39;s not attractive, &quot; said Lauren.<br />
<br />
Aaron walked towards her, swaying his wide nude hips as he walked. &quot;Are you sure?  Your little friend here seems to disagree, &quot; said Aaron, cupping her dick.  It stiffened in his grasp. &quot;C&#39;mon.  Let&#39;s have a little fun before we switch back, just like you wanted. I know you want to try it.  I sure do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lauren was a little concerned by Aaron&#39;s change in behavior.  Was the ring affecting his mind?  But she had to admit that he did look good. And she really did want to try out her new equipment inside another girl.  She decided it wasn&#39;t a big deal.  They could always switch later. For now she was going to have a little fun.  She let Aaron lead her onto the bed.</p>
