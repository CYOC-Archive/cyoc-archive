<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This very evening, I wish for my girlfriend&#39;s new boyfriend Thomas to get abducted by aliens and taken away from Earth.&quot;<br />
The genie seemed to think about it.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... quite unusual. I can do it. But it&#39;s rather vague. Please be more precise. Would you like the aliens to eat him, study him or just have him live as their equal on their planet?&quot;<br />
Damon weighed the different suggestions. He hated that prick Thomas but to get him dead, eaten or dissected was a but too horrible, even for him. Just knowing he&#39;d never return was enough. For the rest... He then smiled in a most evil way. Actually, he could decide what the aliens would do to him. Without killing him, that could bring him down a peg or two. Or more. Ways to get him to become less arrogant and more humiliated. <br />
&quot;Let me work out the details, genie,&quot; he grinned as he picked up a notebook to jot down his various ideas. All of them had their merits and after long last, he showed his final scribbled decision to the genie. It would be such a sweet revenge! <br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s better than death, I guess,&quot; she said with still a bit of reproof in her eyes which annoyed Damon greatly. <br />
&quot;A bit of humility will do him good,&quot; retorted Damon. &quot;Trust me. And it&#39;s not like I&#39;m making him completely unhappy.&quot;<br />
&quot;You sound like a child that has just acted like a bully or a brat and then tries to find excuses for his appalling behavior. To adults and himself. As when he insults another person and when asked to explain himself and apologize, cowardly insists that the insult was referring to something positive, attempting desperately to make his mean words into a compliment. All out of cowardice and even self-delusion. You could teach that Thomas a lesson without being so drastic and petty.&quot; <br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; he grumbled, stung. &quot;Do it before I change my mind and do worst things to that rich jerk.&quot; <br />
&quot;Say it out loud, master,&quot; said the genie with exaggerated patience, though understandable.<br />
Damon did, impatient to never see that arrogant jerk again. And with more wishes to come, it&#39;d be nothing to reconquer Monica. And Thomas would be off in outer space, light-years away and never to return. And it&#39;s not like Damon was condemning him to that bad of a life, after all. The genie was being all holier-than-thou and annoying him greatly. He was not a jerk. On the contrary, he was being very generous considering he could have made Thomas suffer a lot more. <br />
<br />
That evening, as Thomas was lying down in bed and getting ready to sleep, thinking of Monica, whom he&#39;d see tomorrow, he felt the strangest sensation. He felt himself floating upwards brutally and he jumped in fright. A blinding light kept him from seeing things clearly and he could feel large shapes moving about him. Impossibly large shapes. He could hear dull noises all around too. He quickly realized that he was stuck within a sort of glass case. He screamed and banged upon it but to no avail. <br />
The next few minutes were terrifying. Suddenly, a huge, green, stubby and three-fingered hand as large as two garbage lids appeared from above him and grabbed him by the waist. He shouted out and tried to pry the immense fingers off of him but he was quickly raised through the air and transported to a white table. Now he could make things out more clearly and the monster that held him was several times his size, spoke in incomprehensible sounds and had a large mouth with flat teeth and a large lump that counted as its nose. It grabbed a huge syringe and it injected some sort of hard thing in Thomas&#39;s neck. The young human screamed in pain. He had had barely time to get scared of the syringe. He thrashed as he was put back in his glass enclosure. Yet as time passed, he came to realize that he could understand now the creatures which were speaking in perfect English. He grunted as as the thing embedded in his skin became dull. He was in a sort of lab, white and clean but in which he was basically the size of a large puppy to the strange monsters. Strange monsters that spoke of gathering different species from various planets and that merchants would. come. Thomas yelled out his panic and finally, a monster approached.<br />
&quot;Who are you? What do you want from me?&quot;<br />
&quot;We are much more advanced beings than you, a long way from your home planet. As we are aware that you are semi-sentient, more or less, the chip we&#39;ve inserted in your body always you to understand us and speak our language. It&#39;ll make things easier for all.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to me? I&#39;m scared, I&#39;m naked...&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be sold, of course. Someone will come to pick you up and give you to merchants at the market.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why!?!?&quot;<br />
&quot;For money. Don&#39;t be daft.&quot; <br />
&quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
&quot;We select random humans and not very often or by large amounts, to keep your species unaware. You were selected, that&#39;s all. And a young, strapping, male, healthy specimen like you will be sure to bring in a hefty sum. Now shush. Not all of us can loiter around in a cage.&quot;<br />
The alien gave him a bowl of water and sorts of pellet, along with some chopped straw. Humiliated, Thomas was left to urinate in it. <br />
<br />
Much later, another alien came in and picked up Thomas&#39; glass cage after staring at him and nodding. He chose other cages containing deer, bulls and pigs, as well as some other alien beings from other planets. The captive creatures were placed in a hovering vehicles and after a long trip, Thomas and the other beings to be sold were examined, passed on and checked with much scrutiny before they were handed over to other similar green giant aliens which were in a immense building with stands and wares. They had arrived. The market with more strange objets and beings than Thomas could ever have imagined. Except he was one of the commodities! He was placed on the stand alongside some of the other creatures. He started to cry. Who would purchase him? And for what purpose? Unbeknownst to him, Damon had already explained to the genie what he wanted Thomas&#39; ultimate fate to be...</p>
