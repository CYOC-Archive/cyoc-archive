<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I get to be YOU?? This is so cool!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, have a seat. Eddie, sit here across from Mr. Russell Boswell. Mr. Sully Fletcher, let&#39;s have you sit across from Lewis here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! How tall are you?&quot; Eddie gushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 6 foot 1. That&#39;s how tall you&#39;re going to be in just a few minutes, bud.&quot; The biker said with a wily grin. &#39;His voice is so deep and scary!&#39; Eddie thought.<br />
<br />
Eddie&#39;s eyes went big as they could go. Eddie actually had small eyes and big ears, and a big sweep of chestnut hair. The boy sitting opposite his dad was light curly blond, and a bit on the small side. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man, glad to meet you!&quot; Russell shook Eddies hand, and it was nowhere near as big as the older man&#39;s. His hand covered Eddie&#39;s hand completely. Russell had long dirty blond-brown hair and had a thick goatee. His breath smelled heavily of the cedar-reminiscent odor of cigar that was so foreign to Eddie, yet he was immediately entranced by it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Lewis,&quot; Mr. Fletcher said, shaking the small boy&#39;s hand. &quot;How old is he?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 7!&quot; Lewis said, holding up his fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s really young for this program. I&#39;ll be one of the youngest ones here, then.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, but we all promise we&#39;ll have your back, brother. You got this,&quot; Russell said, his voice as rough as his many tattoos. Russell&#39;s body was impressively tatted and impressively muscled. He was fingering a cigar. &quot;Actually, I was hoping to smoke a stogie before going in.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t have time for that,&quot; one of the counselors told him. &quot;We have a schedule to maintain.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, fuck. That&#39;s what I get for waiting. Guess you&#39;ll be smoking this later, huh kid?&quot; <br />
<br />
Eddie&#39;s eyes went big and his father narrowed his eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I should say that shouldn&#39;t be the focus, getting my kid to start smoking.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey hey. Relax, amigo. I&#39;ll give you a cigar when this is all over and we&#39;ll smoke out together if you want. Just trying to say the kid is gonna have cravings in my body so it&#39;ll be a good idea to just allow him all the smokes he wants, comprende?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sully was trying not to be rude, but he couldn&#39;t say he really approved much of this man as a father and he didn&#39;t want his son taking up bad habits because of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know you must think that we&#39;re tempting your son to do things he shouldn&#39;t,&quot; the counselor, whose name was Tom, continued. &quot;But it&#39;s good life experience for him to try as many adult things out now as possible, so that he will be ready for it later and can handle doing those things in an adult manner. Especially with drinking.&quot; <br />
<br />
Russell grinned devilishly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I did bring some Jack Daniels.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Eddie asked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something you&#39;re not drinking until you&#39;re older.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Which should be in a few minutes,&quot; Russell said, winking. &quot;So uh, we gonna do this thing or what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...yes. Yes, of course,&quot; Mr. Fletcher said. <br />
<br />
&quot;We still have to go over a few things,&quot; one of the nurses said. &quot;Now, covering your claims...&quot; The rest was run of the mill insurance stuff. Anything you don&#39;t disclose can get you in trouble and result in being deswapped and thrown out. Violations of adults while in children&#39;s bodies doing anything adult was grounds for immediate removal from the camp. Kids in adult bodies were free to do whatever they want within reason. They are considered the parents in charge the minute they wake up from the swap procedure. <br />
<br />
Sully wasn&#39;t so sure about all this but he shouldn&#39;t back out now. He was having regrets over having had the idea to do this but he couldn&#39;t turn back now. Eddie was so looking forward to a summer as a big boy! Everything was already paid for and arrangements were ready to go. He guessed he&#39;d just have to get used to being 7 years old again! Not to mention having his son inhabit this dirty biker&#39;s obscenely muscled body. Was that a tattoo of a naked woman on his chest?? Oh Good Lord, he thought. <br />
<br />
The swap machine was a pair of simple beds. Jacks were inserted into their craniums. A blinking blue light went on. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE <br />
<br />
Suddenly Eddie found himself sitting in another cabin. This must be the virtual cabin, he thought. Suddenly, his father was there, as well as Mr. Boswell, who he was going to swap with, and his father sat across from Lewis, same as they had before. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, I guess they&#39;re getting us all ready. When we wake up, we&#39;re going to be body swapped, everybody! Whoooo! Yeah, this is gonna be wild, brother!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think-&quot; Mr. Fletcher said and then disappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. Looks like he&#39;s been downloaded-&quot; Russell said, before disappearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh! I&#39;m going to be a grown up!&quot; Lewis said. &quot;This is gonna be awesome!&quot; He disappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;m the last one who-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Fletcher? Mr. Fletcher, can you hear me, Mr. Fletcher? Eddie. Wake up, Eddie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? Mmm.&quot; Sleepy. I&#39;m sleepy. Mmmm. Eddie felt himself rise. He was a big groggy. He stood up and wobbled a bit, but the nurse helped him. He was now looking down at the nurse. A counselor was also there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eddie? You okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Yeah, I&#39;m okay. Is that...my voice? I sound so...different!&quot; <br />
<br />
They brought him over to a mirror. There, standing before him, was a fully fledged adult. Scraggly long biker hair, tied up in the back. A big brown-blond goatee. He could taste something on the inside of his mouth, some slick flavor of tobacco he&#39;d never experienced before. &quot;I&#39;m...so tall. I&#39;m tall,&quot; he said, bewildered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s gonna take you a while to get used to it,&quot; one of the counselors said, in a clipped, practiced manner, though still retaining a friendly air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s my daddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the Daddy. Do you mean your new son?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; Eddie was flabbergasted. They had him get dressed in Mr. Boswell&#39;s jeans, shirt and denim jacket. It was the most surreal moment of his life to come out to a waiting room where his father was fully awake and twirling around the lobby in little kid clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, everyone, you&#39;ll have to borrow each other&#39;s clothes so be sure to do the clothes swap tonight, okay? We want you all comfortably dressed. We&#39;ll bring you back to your cabins now. How does everyone feel? Good? Is everyone doing okay?&quot; The doctor went through the routine post body swap checkout more quickly than he would in a hospital. There were too many swaps to spend too much time on any particular group if he could help it. <br />
<br />
Although everyone had different bodies now, they would keep their names. It was camp tradition to use Big or Little with your old name. So the kids would have Big in front of their names and the fathers would have Little in front of theirs. <br />
<br />
Eddie walked as if in a trance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this weird, Dad?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, call me son as long as you&#39;re in that big body.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Dad. I mean...son. This is so different. My voice and...I can&#39;t believe how tall I am. And my muscles!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait until you jerk off for the first time,&quot; Little Sully said, taking his now much bigger new father by the hand. <br />
<br />
Eddie smiled. &quot;My hand is way bigger than yours! Awesome! Okay, come on, SON! Let&#39;s get some dinner after we all swap clothes, okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
The two families swapped clothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m in this little boy body! I feel so tiny, haha! This is pretty crazy, amigos! And what about you? You&#39;re even smaller than me! I&#39;m 9 in this body, and you&#39;re only 7! You know it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a big difference until you actually are that age! Then you can really tell what a difference it is, you know?&quot; Little Russ said to Little Sully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, check me out. I&#39;m a supertall grown up now!&quot; Big Lewis said to Big Ed. Eddie had decided Ed was a more grown up name and so he wanted to change it when he got to be an adult. Now that he actually was one, he couldn&#39;t be happier. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you? Your dad&#39;s body is freaking huge! I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t swap with my dad. this is like...HI I&#39;M BIG ED. I&#39;M A GROWN UP NOW. I&#39;LL HAVE A BEER, PLEASE.&quot; Big Ed said, trying out his new big manly voice out, deepening it even further as he talked. &quot;Wow! I can&#39;t believe I can sound like that now! I sound so grown up!&quot; Big Ed ran a hand through his new beard. He couldn&#39;t believe how much this ruled! <br />
<br />
Eventually it was time for dinner and they could talk with everyone else who had swapped that night. There was excitement in the air as a hundred boys found themselves in big, adult male bodies for the first time. And their fathers or guardians were getting to relive their childhoods!<br />
<br />
It was going to be the best summer ever, Big Ed thought. <br />
<br />
In his new tiny 7 year old body, Little Sully was having doubts. Should he really go through with this? Everyone was so much bigger than him now! It was actually more than a little intimidating to him. It made him feel like looking at the ground rather than straining to look up at all the big adults. </p>
