<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say it was &quot;odd&quot; waking up from a heavy, drowsy nap as a completely different species, would be quite the understatement. It was odd, awkward, humiliating, and terrifying. <br />
<br />
A loud snort woke me up. The nap was wonderfully refreshing, one I didn&#39;t want to wake from. My dick was still a-glow beneath the bulk of my weight. I had the craziest of dreams.<br />
<br />
Stretching outward, yawning, slowly blinking my eyes open, I tried taking a look around. But everything seemed dulled. Blurry. Out of focus. And strangest of all, was the panoramic-like vision I had. I tried reaching up to rub the sleep from my eyes so I could more fully open them, but my arms wouldn&#39;t work the way I had intended. As a matter of fact, my arms didn&#39;t feel like arms at all. Neither did my hands fur that matter......they felt like.....<br />
<br />
I stretched again, trying to gain a grip on something. Anything. But.....my hands....! I opened my eyes for fully, and the limbs I was stretching....They....they were.....LEGS! And my &quot;hands!&quot; My previous &quot;hands&quot; were missing! Replaced by.....<br />
<br />
&quot;HOOVES!&quot; I tried saying, which came out as the most terrifying and humiliating noise to my TWITCHING ears:<br />
&quot;Haaaaaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
I stopped cold to look around, craning my long, thick neck. My body, which was still lying prone on my belly, was that of....<br />
&quot;Heeeeeee,&quot; I breathed in, &quot;HAAAAaaaaaawwwq!!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then it all came rushing back to me! The costume! The letter! It....it was all real! It worked! It really, REALLY fucking worked! That costume dissolved my entire human body into the shape and physiology of the donkey who&#39;s hide I put on! <br />
<br />
That letter! It said the effect would last 24 hours! Well, at least it was only 24 hours.... Or was it? What if it was wrong and I was STUCK like this!? As a fucking donkey! Forever! I&#39;d have to live my life as a god damned ASS! But. No. No! If it was right about turning me into a donkey in the first place, then SURELY it was right about the effect lasting only 24 hours? <br />
<br />
With a &quot;haaaaaawww,&quot; I began to rise from my prone position to my feet. My....FOUR feet! <br />
<br />
Looking around at this god awful body, I thought to myself resignedly:<br />
<br />
(&quot;24 hours, huh?&quot;) As I huffed / sighed / haaawwwwed lightly. (&quot;Well, it better be. Because. This really.....REALLY Fucking. SUCKS!&quot;)<br />
<br />
But.... But the only thing is.... I was supposed to go to work tomorrow! How the hell was I going to even do that? Call off sick? I spied my phone, then looked back down at....my front legs and their fucking HOOVES! And just how the hell was I even supposed to use a cell phone!? <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeeeee.....HAAAAaaaawww!&quot; (&quot;God....dammit!&quot;)  <br />
<br />
I froze in growing dread as I realized something else....<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaaawwww.....heeeeeeeeee hhhhhaaaaawwww!&quot; I tried experimentally. I felt the fur on all over my body prickle up in terror.<br />
<br />
(&quot;Oh god.... I can&#39;t even....fucking.....TALK!&quot;) <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeee hhhhhaaaawww!&quot; I tried again, feeling my large ears flatten on top of my new thick skull. But no! No words would escape my lips! My....my.....DONKEY LIPS! <br />
<br />
(&quot;Oh....oh god! I&#39;m....I&#39;m just a....a....fucking.....braying JACKASS&quot;) <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhhaaawww heeee hhhhaaaww!&quot; I tried speaking again, to no avail! I couldn&#39;t talk! Not a single word was I able to form! Nothing but the irritating noisy bray that only DONKEYS can make! <br />
<br />
I tried &quot;stretching&quot; my &quot;arms&quot; in the hopes that I was just simply stuck inside of a costume and not an actual donkey. But. No. No! I was DEFINITELY a god damned donkey! I was definitely NOT wearing a y sort of costume, and those were definitely legs! Not arms! <br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEEeeeeee HAAAAAaaaawww!&quot; I squealed again, in mental discomfort. Wanting desparately to be able to stand back up on two legs and to have arms, hands, and fingers again! Hyperventilating in growing panic as I realized I was completely incapable to actually use or do anything! Hell, I couldn&#39;t even fucking SPEAK! But less be able to manipulate a phone or drive a car! I was nothing but a dirty, smelly fucking FARM ANIMAL! <br />
<br />
(&quot;Ok,&quot;) I thought to myself, closing my eyes. Trying to calm myself down. (&quot;Alright. So ...I&#39;m....I&#39;m a.....a.....ah, fuck it! So I&#39;m currently stuck as a donkey. That letter mention it was for 24 hours. 24 hours....&quot;) I continued to think.<br />
<br />
Shit! I had to think of a way to call in sick to work. Or at least come up with an excuse for when I turn back into myself! Fuck! My job was at risk, and herei stood as a god damned four-legged beast that can&#39;t even clean itself! Why did I STINK so god damn much!? And my breath! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee hhhhaaaawww!&quot; I squealed again, pounding a hooves right front leg on the floor of my living room. A fucking DONKEY! For the rest of today and into tomorrow! <br />
<br />
(&quot;No wonder that letter also warned to make sure to make proper plans,or however it was worded.... That letter!&quot;) It was still sitting on the coffee table where I had left it!<br />
<br />
With the awkwardness of moving around with the body of a completely different species for the first time, I took my first tentative four-legged steps towards the table. God, my body was now so large and bulky, I was clumsy as hell with it! My vision was strange, and only kept my balance due to my much larger inner ears and my ...my......TAIL! <br />
<br />
A fucking TAIL! The thought brought great deal of sickening humiliation. I have a god damned TAIL! And my exposed gigantic dick and low-hanging grapefruit-sized nuts. I could feel them away and wobble with every little big of movement, hanging low beneath my animalistic anus! Another terrible thought, one I already had:<br />
<br />
What if I DONT change back!? What if I&#39;m just stuck like this!? A dirty, naked animal, with its male equipment wide-open for anyone to see!? Never to wear any sort of clothing! God, I hope not! I hated this form in the privacy of my own home and for the hour or whatever it&#39;s been as it is! <br />
<br />
&quot;HAAaaawww!&quot; I huffed as I kicked the floor with a hoof, trying to remain calm. The last thing I wanted to do was to destroy my home. My job was already going to be at risk. There was a very good possibility this is as only going to be temporary and that I would change back tomorrow as that letter said. I already must have made a really nasty mess on the carpet. I could kick myself as I realized I should have done that on the kitchen or bathroom floors that are made of hard tiled linoleum. Would be much easier to clean up. The carpet would now have to be steam-cleaned. Fucking donkey jizz soaking into it....<br />
<br />
I desparately wanted a shower. Needing to be thoroughly bathed, but there was no way for me to possibly be able to clean myself. At best, I thought at one point, is that I might be able to turn on the shower in the upstairs main bathroom. But the stairwell would prove both too narrow for the sheer width of large donkey&#39;s body, and too steep with steps too narrow for it&#39;s large hooves that was only meant for walking upon open plains. Not walking up narrow steps. <br />
<br />
Growing ever more bored, I next decided to at least try to look at my face in a mirror. I managed to squeeze my long neck and front shoulders through the downstairs bathroom enough to look at my reflection, which I somehow expected to ee myself, despite the feeling of having a long, thick skull, the movement of large ears on top, and the inability to make facial expressions. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, it was a shock to see some random ass donkey&#39;s head and face with its big brown blank eyeballs staring back! The eyes of a normal jackass! Except, it&#39;s my mind, ME! That resides behind those dimwitted eyes! My mind is trapped with the body of a jackass! With no way to communicate or use anything! <br />
<br />
(&quot;Omg, omg, omg! Nobody would know what happened to me if I were stuck like this! They&#39;d be looking at me, but all they&#39;d see would be just some ordinary old donkey! <br />
<br />
&#39;oh god.....oh God! I don&#39;t what to be a donkey! I don&#39;t want to be stuck like this!&quot;) I was thinking. Beginning to hyperventilate. Looking from the mirror down to the bottoms of my front legs, which just ends in two hardened points.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee...eee....eeee,&quot; I choked inward. Feeling big tears coming to my big eyes as I stood there thinking further, while wanting to move and flex a bunch of digits I no longer had:<br />
<br />
(&quot;Hooves.... Oh god! Fucking HOOVES! I can&#39;t....I can&#39;t move....my fingers! I ...I HAVE no fingers! Oh....oh GOD! I NEED to move my fingers! I NEED my hands!!!&quot;) <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee....eee...HAAAAAaaaaawww!!!&quot; I choked them bellowed outward,stretching my long broad neck outward, my teeth and tongue coming as far out as I could stretch them, as if trying to escape this shitty fucking body! <br />
<br />
The more I continued trying to flex a bunch of fingers I no longer had, the worse I felt! It was like having a large pair boots stuck on your feet with your socks bunching between two random toes. You&#39;re trying to flex your toes to remove them, but can&#39;t. Your boots are too restrictive and the more you try, the more desparate you become to remove your boots!<br />
<br />
Except, they were not boots on my hands preventing my fingers from moving. I had fucking HOOVES that have replaced my hands altogether! Nothing but...<br />
<br />
 Big. Blocky. Fucking. HOOOOOVES! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeeee....hhhhaaaawww...heeeee ....HAAAAaaaaawww!&quot; Still unable to speak!!<br />
<br />
I became SO desparate to freely move and flex my non-existent hands and their fingers that I became horny all over again! Without even thinking about it, I collapsed back onto the floor, my big old donkey head still in the bathroom, the rest of my body in the carpeted kitchen to living room hallway. <br />
<br />
I managed to stretch my front legs out into the bathroom. My....FRONT LEGS! And...and....their fucking HOOVES! Useless. Fucking. HOOVES!! <br />
<br />
(&quot;OH.....OH...GOOOOD!!!!&quot;) All I wanted was to be able to.....Fucking.....MOVE MY FINGERS! <br />
<br />
I continued to try desoarately to stretch my front legs and hooves out in front of my. Wanting to.....NEEDNG to....&quot;open&quot; my hands and grip something! Anything! <br />
<br />
There was such a a great tension all over my entire huge dirty donkey&#39;s body and my mind, that suddenly, without warning, I felt a major explosive electrical HAMMERING throughout my entire being! I could hardly breath, and my vision went absolutely NUTS! <br />
<br />
BAM! BAM! BAM! Over and over again! Wave after wave of the most intense and terrifying pulsations emanating from the major male organ beneath me that traveled up my spine, and throughout my entire body and mind! <br />
<br />
Though I could hardly think any thought in actual term, I did manage to think that this was it! That the magic was working to extract me from this costume! <br />
<br />
But...no.....No! It....it wasnt! That crazy energetic feeling began to due down! I felt my dick still somewhat pulsing as I retracted back into its home beneath my heavy body! My mind slowly coming back to reality. The reality that....no....NO! I...I was STILL a fucking donkey!! <br />
<br />
Hee haaww heee hhhaaww heee hhhaaww,&quot; I simply &quot;cried&quot; as I slowly began taking back to my feet again. My....FOUR feet! <br />
<br />
That SMELL! The smell of a very large and very MALE that just got finished doing it&#39;s business came sharply o my large, slimy black nostrils as I stood up, extracted my mead and front legs from the bathroom, backed up, and craned my head down to inspect what sort of mess I just made on the carpet. <br />
<br />
(&quot;Oh....oh God dammit!&quot;) I thought, simultaneously thinking that I couldn&#39;t even take a shower and clean my house, no matter how much I needed to bathe this god forsaken nasty fucking body and chean up after myself! <br />
<br />
But I was surprisingly calmer now. (&quot;Ok....24 hours,&quot;) I thought more clearly. The tension mostly subsided. <br />
<br />
(&quot;That letter. It said 1 day. I&#39;ll pay skend 1 day as this damned animal. That it. Just. 1 day. I&#39;ll be able to rent or buy a carpet cleaner. Hell, I may even want to purchase a new carpet altogether.... But....first, I have to get through this nightmare....)<br />
<br />
My thoughts next turning to how long I&#39;ve been a donkey already. Not much more than an hour or two. Oh god, it already felt like an eternity, and I wanted badly to be able to do something leisurely for the rest of my Sunday. Like, watch TV or play a video game on my computer.... But....No.... I can&#39;t! <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaaawww....&quot; I sighed softly as I realized: <br />
<br />
I can&#39;t DO, like, ANYTHING! Nothing! I had the same exact body of a mindless fucking farm animal, but the mind of a human! All I could do, was just. Like. STAND here! <br />
<br />
And so, I just stood there. In the middle of one of my living rooms. Just stood there on all fours, just waiting. Standing there, waiting. Occassionally snuffling and braying in irritation. Feeling the irritating numbness from my four digitless hooves.</p>
