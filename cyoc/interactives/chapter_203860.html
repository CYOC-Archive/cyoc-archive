<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly we were in a different place. I looked around, recognizing that we were no longer in the fitness store, but I was sitting in the food court once again. I’m front of me was a half-eaten burger and fries, and across from me sitting at the other side of the table with a much smaller, barely touched meal of his own, was a twink I recognized - Dorian, be he looked different than before. He still had the facial and body hair he started with - ‘One last thing to get rid of’, I thought to myself - but he looked, softer, I thought. It took me a minute, but I soon realized the aged qualities he had were now less so - his slight wrinkles gone, along with the peppery quality his hair had - it was now all black. He also seemed to have an air of innocence and nervousness around him, which immediately made the rod between my legs jump with excitement. I smirked, happily enjoying lunch with the adorable young man I had made. I knew that I had just lost some years of my life, but I didn’t care. I was so close to the socially submissive big-dicked twink I wanted, and besides, I knew that I was sexy and I had the confidence to admit it. <br />
Dorian, across the table, nervously prodded at his sandwich - which still didn’t have a bite taken out of it. He looked like he wanted to say something but was too nervous, a feeling I knew very well just a moment ago. “What’s on your mind, champ? Nervous to be eating dinner from such a sexy guy, is that it?” I sat back in my chair, smirking as I reached for a try to stick into my mouth. I reveled in the feeling of my muscles moving against the back of the chair as my arm reached to my mouth. <br />
He spoke, his deep voice seeming to come out of nowhere. “I- well, um, I’m just… surprised that I guy like you even noticed someone like me…” My dick stiffened as he stammered, getting turned on by his nervousness and the idea of him ramming his cock into me. I had never felt so turned on before in my life. <br />
“Don’t worry about it, champ. Little guys like you are exactly my type.” I gave him a wink, which made him visibly blush.<br />
“But- but what did someone sees? I’m… not exactly out to my coworkers… and I have these kids and…” He trailed off. He looked genuinely worried, which concerned me greatly. I didn’t like seeing him scared. I needed to do something to help.<br />
I leaned forward, placing my large vascular hand on top of his smaller, almost child-like hand. I gave him a serious look, dropping the cocky attitude for a moment. “ Hey, look at me.” His gaze sheepishly met mine. “If you spot any of your coworkers and they give you trouble, I’m not going to be okay with that. I’ll make sure they accept you for who you are, I promise that.” A promise I could easily keep, thanks to my ability. “As for your kids, I’d love to meet them someday. I’m pretty great with kids. But if you don’t feel comfortable introducing me as your date, you can just say I’m your work friend or something. I don’t mind.” I gave him a smile, and watched his heart melt and he smiled back. “Let’s just enjoy this, okay? I want to see where this goes.” Dorian’s worried look melted into a smile and I knew my words worked. He also squirmed in his seat, and I felt pride knowing his large dick was hard.<br />
I loved this confident feeling I just was carrying this whole time. I felt like the man I always wanted to be and I loved having this positive self-image i’d never had before.<br />
Now that Dorian has calmed down, we finished our meals while making light converation, and the conversation continued for a while after that. While I was incredibly horny the whole time, I genuinely enjoyed the time spent learning about Dorian (and myself, as I allowed myself to speak freely, revealing some information about myself in this reality.<br />
In this version of reality, Dorian was a 26-year old man, who graduated college at 21 and worked as a personal trainer after that. Despite his size, he was quite successful, and was one of the most successful and desired trainers in the city. He also shared that he had a genetic disease that alternated generations in how it worked. He started puberty when he was 8, but it stopped early for him, only having the puberty effects in his sexual awakening and giving him hair growth. This meant that he was sexually mature at 12, his voice deepened significantly, and had grown a lot of body and facial hair, but the rest of his body remained undeveloped, giving explanation to the odd presentation he had. He also explained that his father and sons had the opposite effects. They still had early puberty, but they matured in every way very quickly except sexually, and their voices would never deepen while they stayed entirely hairless apart from the tops of their heads. I supposed this disease was the result of my meddling, but I didn’t worry to much about it as Dorian seemed fine with the effects. He also talked about his kids just a little since he already mentioned them earlier. He said  the first one was born when he was 15, and the kids’ mom apparently specifically requested his sperm for some reason? It didn’t make sense but not every change always does. Anyways, he stepped in as a father figure even though he was still in high school and is a proud dad.<br />
I was surprised with how much personal information he just shared. I even asked, since that absolutely was not prompted at all, and he just said “I dunno, I guess I just wanted to tell you… and I feel like I can trust you. You don’t seem the type to use this stuff against me.” He wasn’t wrong, and I felt butterflies when he told me this. It felt good to know that not only had the kind of person I am not changed, but Dorian could tell that as well.<br />
As for myself, I was now 43 years old, and worked at the same factory as before. I’m a manager there now though, not a bottom-tier worker. Apparently I studied business management in college and I’ve worked at the factory ever since, and I’m fairly wealthy now. I guess the age was helpful for something! I was also a gym rat now, spending 4-5 nights each week in my home gym (which was also new), explaining my newfound muscles. I decided to share some personal stuff as well, to even out the field, so to speak. Apparently I was abandoned as a baby and I was adopted by my parents (originally my grandparents) when I was 6, making my original father my older brother now. I was the star quarterback of my high school football team, and my first boyfriend was in college, my first roommate who was also a very small guy. While I’d had several boyfriends, and not all of them twinks, I’d never married, even when it legalized, because I never felt like any of them were ‘the one’. <br />
Eventually, we moved topics to shared interests, and we both played the game Valorance, and we talked about our experiences and epic moments we enjoyed from the game. Eventually, Blake approached the two of us, an annoyed expression in his face. “Hey dad, we need to get going. Mom’s already going to be late to her date tonight and we need to get home.” Dorian picked up his phone and saw the time? and I did too. We’d been talking for four hours! “Oh shit, uh, one sec-“ He looked back at me, and I quickly handed him my phone. He entered in his number and slid it back to me. <br />
“I’ll text you later.” I smirked as I opened the camera and took a picture of Dorian unannounced, resulting in him giving the camera an awkward smile and making for an equally awkward photo. He began to say goodbye but before he could, Blake picked up his dad and jogged back to the rest of his family. I chuckled as I stood up myself and began walking to my car, a confident smirk on my face from my first successful encounter with Dorian.</p>
