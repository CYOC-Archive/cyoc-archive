MEANWHILE, I couldn&#39;t post this until after I came home from work for the day, but saw that others had already moved the story beyond the night in question, so I hope everyone enjoys what is now a bonus episode.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
When his penis finally relaxed, the werevixen sighed as the topknot of her husband&#39;s wonderful foxhood slid out of her. Since then, William and Martha Anderson cuddled and necked, gently kissing and caressing each other&#39;s furry bodies. They could hear their dear friends and lesbian werecats Samantha and Frances Twist basically doing the same thing nearby. All were resting after a tremendous round of sex, but the night and the orgy were both far from over.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but I&#39;m still horny as hell,&quot; announced Martha, before passionately kissing her husband.<br />
&quot;Now there&#39;s a surprise,&quot; quipped Samantha, before she started suckling on one of her wife&#39;s breasts.<br />
&quot;Technology is a great thing,&quot; began Martha, as she moved to position herself on the rec room floor on all fours while facing the Twists. &quot;Pseudo penises are far better today than they were ten years ago, and we do have a great time when it&#39;s just the three of us and our toys ladies,&quot; she added, while licking her lips seductively at the Twists, &quot;but they still can&#39;t beat the real thing. William, I want you to give my ass a <i>really</i> good pounding,&quot; she told her husband, while raising her rear and vixen&#39;s tail higher up. &quot;Samantha, crawl over here and let&#39;s 69,&quot; said Martha seductively, while playing with her own breasts.<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; replied the werecat lustily, as she moved to position herself under her bi-lover.<br />
&quot;Hey! What about me?&quot; asked Frances in a mock pout.<br />
Martha moaned as Samantha started licking the wet outer folds of her cunt. &quot;William&#39;s tongue isn&#39;t busy, and we all know how talented he is at oral,&quot; the werevixen reminded her, before Martha lowered her head to start lapping delicious cream out of the furry chalice before her.<br />
<br />
Considering how oversexed his wife could be at times, and how horny they all were, the tip of William Anderson&#39;s hard vulpine penis easily slipped between the folds of Martha&#39;s butt cheeks to start penetrating her anus as his paws gripped her ass.<br />
He turned his head and licked the lips of his muzzle in anticipation of the treat that awaited him, even as his keen ears heard Samantha eagerly enjoying his wife. Whether on accident or purpose, every once in a while William felt the werecat&#39;s talented tongue lick his ball sac, and he wondered once more if he could ever talk the lesbian couple into fully exploring bi-sex with a male, even as he began licking the sweet juices from Frances Twist&#39;s wet cunt.<br />
&quot;Oh William,&quot; moaned Frances, as her paws guided his head to the areas that needed the most attention.<br />
Even as the werefox started fucking his wife faster at the urging of her ass pressing against him harder, the wonderful sensations of his topknot sinking deeper into her rectum driving him crazy with lust, William Anderson started concentrating on Frances&#39; clit.<br />
Soon all three ladies were moaning, practically in unison, over the oral pleasures they were giving and receiving.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before William joined them, feeling his foxhood pulse to fill Martha&#39;s ass with hot werefox semen, even as all four adults shouted out the excitement of their enjoyable ecstasies.<br />
<br />
UPSTAIRS...<br />
Eric Anderson truly did have a little homework left to attend to, but it was soon taken care of. With the school books stored away for the evening, he turned on his computer and started surfing the Internet while waiting for Julie Stovall to join him in chat.<br />
When she finally appeared, Eric could see it looked like Julie had been crying again.<br />
&quot;Your folks again?&quot; he asked, sympathetically, staring at her webcam transmitted image on his monitor.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Dad just announced he has to go on a business trip soon, and will be taking his secretary with him,&quot; revealed Julie.<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Eric, instantly understanding the problem.<br />
&quot;I understand mom&#39;s concerns, but shouldn&#39;t you wait until <i>after</i> the guy has actually done something to be guilty of before you start punishing him?&quot; asked Julie.<br />
&quot;If it was parents versus children, our folks would call it preventive medicine, or some such nonsense like that,&quot; pointed out Eric.<br />
&quot;Yeah. I just love those double standards, don&#39;t you?&quot; asked Julie sarcastically. &quot;If dad hadn&#39;t of waited those ten years to make sure mom was <i>the</i> one while he played the field, maybe they&#39;d be much better off today.&quot;<br />
&quot;And my grandfather has a joke about how if the hunting dog hadn&#39;t stopped to do his business while they were out looking for food, the dinner menu would have been totally different that night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now what&#39;s that got to do with anything?&quot; asked a confused Julie.<br />
&quot;My point exactly,&quot; replied Eric, before changing the subject.<br />
The two high school freshmen talked about more mundane things like school and homework. until Julie inevitably switched the conversation over to her favorite subject. &quot;So, do you think that someday...&quot; she began, while teasingly pulling the top of her nightgown down just enough to bare her shoulders and give Eric more than a hint of what treasures lied elsewhere. The tops of her creamy, alabaster skin breasts were exposed, but left the nipples still covered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie,&quot; began Eric, while staring at the sight before him. &quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like you. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t know whether or not I love you, let alone if I even know what love is to begin with.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sometimes it&#39;s better to listen to your heart than your head,&quot; pointed out Julie, while moving in such a way that pushed her breasts further outward without changing the position of the nightgown.<br />
&quot;Maybe. But then again, there&#39;s also the whole were thing. Now before you respond,&quot; added Eric, raising a finger to keep Julie from speaking, &quot;I have no problem with the basic concept of becoming a were. But as you&#39;ve pointed out before, it&#39;s a one shot deal. Even if things didn&#39;t work out between us, I&#39;d still be a were-merman for the rest of my life and right now, I don&#39;t know what would be the right were for me to become.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric, I wouldn&#39;t care if you became something gross like a werepig or a wererat, as long as we were together. Can&#39;t you see how I feel about you?&quot; pleaded Julie.<br />
But before he could respond, a female voice on her end called out, &quot;Julie. It&#39;s time for bed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay mom!&quot; he heard Julie yell in return.<br />
Eric saw the forlorn look on Julie&#39;s face as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve got to go. See you in school tomorrow.&quot; Then she blew Eric a kiss before breaking the connection for the night.<br />
Eric stared at the blank screen for a couple of moments, thinking how sad Julie&#39;s plight was even without his indecisions and hesitations adding to it. Then he switched back over to the porn website he was on before Julie initiated contact.<br />
He knew what his parents and the Twists were doing in the basement and being 14, Eric&#39;s hormones had already started stirring, as evident by the fact that he was naked from the waist down and the towel draped across his lap was already damp from an earlier release.<br />
Eric took great pride in the fact that he never lied to Julie. Everyone else in his family enjoyed being a were, and he was intrigued by the prospect too. Yet he also knew that if he could find a &quot;normal&quot; girl, he would have gladly lost his virginity ages ago; in part to prove to everyone (including himself) that he wasn&#39;t just a brainiac nerd who never raised his head out of a book.<br />
Other kids at school had mentioned websites that featured &quot;were porn&quot;, and some of that was pretty... fascinating, to say the least.<br />
Yet he wanted to see where love, whatever it actually was, led him.<br />
With that thought, Eric clicked on the nude picture of a gorgeous woman with jet black hair that reminded him of the new girl he met today, and wondered just what kind of were Spencer was.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Nate Anderson, horny werewolf, was on the prowl, yet couldn&#39;t find a female were no matter where he looked.<br />
<i>I know it&#39;s a school night, but is the whole world against me?</i> he wondered. He had met a couple of weres who were out hunting, and even stumbled across a were pick up basketball game at the nearby park that was tempting for him to join in on, but no females!<br />
Frustrated, Nate picked a nice tree in a stretch of forest near his house, sat down against it, and began to take matters into his own paws once more.<br />
He concentrated on the memories of past sexual experiences. It wasn&#39;t quite the same as the real thing, but as his red rocket finally started to rise from its sheath, Nate heard a female voice say, &quot;What a waste!&quot;<br />
Startled, he looked and saw a beautiful and quite naked female standing near a tree across from him. Between the wind blowing away from him and being so lost in thought, Nate wasn&#39;t surprised that he hadn&#39;t sensed the girl earlier. Then Nate revised that thought. He was definitely looking at a woman, probably somewhere in her mid to late 20s, because even the high school senior girls never looked <i>that</i> good.<br />
At least six feet, if not a little taller; she had perfectly round breasts with stiff nipples, long black hair that drifted down to just below her shoulders, shapely curves, a shaven cunt, and rich mocha colored skin. All of which contributed to form the exotic figure before him.<br />
&quot;Allow me to take care of that for you,&quot; she said seductively, eyeing Nate&#39;s now quite hard werewolf cock as she licked her lips.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t catch your scent with the wind against me, but you know what happens if a normal has sex with a were,&quot; Nate warned her.<br />
&quot;Perhaps I don&#39;t want to be normal. Then again, who said I was?&quot; she asked, the lust growing in her voice as she started to approach him.<br />
<br />
As she stepped closer, Nate saw the woman start to change. Black fur began to sprout across her body as she grew even taller. Her breasts enlarged at least another size as her tail began to appear from her rear. Soon hands and feet shifted into feline paws as her ears started to move across her head. By the time she reached Nate, her face had assumed its feline features as the woman fully transformed into a werepanthress.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a nice rod you have there handsome. Allow me,&quot; she said, reaching down to caress it in her paws before bending her head down to give the tip a few licks.<br />
Nate started to moan in pleasure, to which the woman said, &quot;Not yet. This put this where it belongs, and don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m on the pill,&quot; she purred, as she positioned herself to take his werewolf cock into her moist depths.<br />
Nate enjoyed the silkiness of her fur against him as he reached out to put his paws around her waist. What he enjoyed even more was the folds of her hot vagina clamping themselves around his penis as it sank further inside her cunt.<br />
Soon the were couple found a nice rhythm as Nate started licking and suckling her breasts. Yet lust and passion would not be denied, as the werepanthress soon adjusted herself to be on all fours as she demanded Nate to take her.<br />
<br />
Nate eagerly complied, ramming his hard werewolf prick into her hot pussy from behind until both screamed out in pleasure over enjoying a mutual orgasm.<br />
&quot;That was great,&quot; she purred, as they collapsed into each others furry arms. &quot;Soon as you&#39;re ready, let&#39;s see what else you can do.&quot;<br />
It didn&#39;t take Nate long to rise to the challenge, in more ways than one.<br />
The panthress on top. The werewolf on top. Side by side with neither dominant. Anal, with the werepanthress&#39; tail teasing Nate&#39;s chest the whole time.<br />
The were couple were engaged in a mutual session of oral sex when the alarm of Nate&#39;s cellphone on the lanyard around his neck went off.<br />
&quot;DAMN! I&#39;ve got to go!&quot; said Nate, licking his lips after bringing her to another orgasm.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; she moaned, while gently cleaning the tip of his prick.<br />
&quot;When can I see you again?&quot; Nate asked eagerly.<br />
&quot;Actually see me or fuck me?&quot; the werepanthress asked in return, eyeing him closely.<br />
&quot;Either,&quot; he admitted. &quot;The sex is great, but I&#39;d also like to get to know my partner better too.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re starting to know me pretty well,&quot; she teased, running a finger through her wet cunt before brushing it across the werewolf&#39;s lips.<br />
Nate couldn&#39;t resist sucking her finger into his mouth even as she said, &quot;Down boy, or you&#39;re gonna start something neither of us has the time to finish. Now then, what&#39;s your name?&quot; she asked, standing to her full height.<br />
In their were forms, the panthress was just as tall as the werewolf, and Nate knew he was at least a good eight feet. But in human shape, Nate suspected he was shorter.<br />
&quot;Nate,&quot; he replied, staring into her golden eyes.<br />
&quot;A nice, strong name. How old are you?&quot; asked the werepanthress.<br />
He hesitated for a second before admitting, &quot;16.&quot; There was no point in lying to this gorgeous creature before him.<br />
&quot;Good thing I like them kind of young. LOTS of stamina,&quot; she said, kissing Nate even as she reached down to grasp his cock in her paws again. &quot;This is mine now. Understand my handsome wolf?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, you sexy panthress you,&quot; he replied, while putting his arms around her to make the kiss last longer.<br />
When they finally stopped kissing, she smiled at him and said, &quot;Right here. Tomorrow night. Seven at the latest, or I go on the prowl to look for someone else. Understand?&quot;<br />
Nate wasn&#39;t too happy about that last part, but shook his head in agreement.<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t go bragging or talking about me to ANY one, or you&#39;ll never see me again!&quot; she warned.<br />
Nate gulped and nodded his head in agreement again as the werepanthress gave him one last peck on the side of his muzzle. Then she turned and leapt into a tree. Within seconds, the werepanthress had disappeared into the night, leaving Nate wondering what he was getting into and who she was, for the lady had never said her name.<br />
<br />

AFTERWORD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES 2<br />
In my last contribution to this thread, I forgot to mention that the &quot;Earth-1&quot; Martha Anderson kept her bi-ness suppressed until after moving to Moon Lake and becoming a werecat. Reading <i>Foursome, Anyone?</i> reveals that the &quot;Earth-2&quot; Martha has a different back story before becoming a werevixen.<br />
Meanwhile, the &quot;Earth-1&quot; Eric Anderson is truly in love with Julie Stovall, and intends to become her were-merman when the time is right. But he doesn&#39;t know that Julie recently received confirmation that they are each other&#39;s soul mates and destined to be together.<br />
Hope the &quot;Earth-2&quot; Eric figures out what love is eventually.<br />
As for who the werepanthress that Nate encountered in this episode is, that remains to be seen, but she definitely has a vastly different personality than the one who just received permission to start dating Ben on &quot;Earth-1&quot;.</p>
