<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk back to the cabin was a bit awkward for Eric, both physically and emotionally. On a purely physical level, the sensation of walking on half-human, half-reindeer legs still felt a bit unusual, though at least he managed not to fall over again. However, it was the emotional stress of walking alongside Clyde’s big brother that was really getting to Eric. Not only was Rudy really laying on the pressure for him to stay for Clyde’s sake, but he was even offering Eric a chance at a job. It was a lot of responsibility, for sure, but for some reason Eric found himself really considering the offer. ‘<i>They wrote a song about that Rudolph guy… I wonder if I could get one about me someday?</i>’ Eric thought to himself, giggling a bit at the thought as Rudy just looked at him with a bemused expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“Alright, here we are. Home sweet home,” Rudy replied as they stood in front of Eric’s cabin. “I really hope to see you for dinner tomorrow… And my mate’s a great cook, so make sure you work up a big appetite at your lessons.”<br />
<br />
Rudy laughed and gave a short wave and his nose twinkled for a second despite still being in his human form, then he turns to walk back toward the train to Santa’s Village.<br />
<br />
“Oh, and make sure you get lots of sleep, okay? Take it easy tonight and try to stay in, since we want you in top form tomorrow at your lesson. <i>Öitä!</i>”<br />
<br />
The bigger man soon disappeared down the street, fading into the swirling slow with his glowing nose still faintly visible, drawing some attention from the passers-by while Eric headed inside his cabin to relax. He tossed his now unwearable boots to the side, then he walked over to his bed with his new hooves clopping noisily against the wooden floorboards.<br />
<br />
”I just bought those boots, too...” he groaned as he fell over backwards onto the bed, then he sat up immediately as a jolt of pain shot through his backside. ”Tail... Don’t lay on your tail...” he murmured to himself as he laid back down more gently. Even these little changes, although they weren’t affecting his everyday life too much, were definitely taking some getting used to.<br />
<br />
Eric lay back on the bed and closed his eyes, trying to imagine what he might look like once his transformation was complete, if he decided to go through with this. Would he look the same as he did when he wore the magic collar, or would he hold onto a few of his old features? After all, Clyde’s human form still bore an uncanny resemblance to his reindeer self, so maybe the opposite would be true for him?<br />
<br />
Eric continued to concentrate on his imagined self, trying to picture what he’d look like. However, no matter what he tried, the only image that came to mind was Clyde, naked except for his fur and standing over him with a big friendly smile on his muzzle.<br />
<br />
”<i>Enjoy yourself last night, Eric?</i>” his fantasy reindeer mate asked sultrily with his irresistible accent, running a hoof across his chest-fur. “<i>Well, I’ll have you know that I’m a far better lover in my true form than in my human one. Care to compare?</i>”<br />
<br />
His eyes still tightly shut, Eric took a deep breath and felt his cock stiffening immediately. His sheets still smelled of Clyde from the night they’d spent together, so it was as though the reindeer really was right in the room with him, hovering over him lewdly with his erect cock drooling. “<i>You’re my mate, Eric. Your body is changing because of how much it desires me. How much it desires <b>this</b>,</i>” the fantasy Clyde cooed, thrusting his cock closer to Eric’s face. “<i>By the time you’re done changing, your little tailhole will be like a glove, perfectly fitted only for your mate’s cock.</i>”<br />
<br />
Eric knew Clyde would never say anything like this in real life. The handsome reindeer was too much of a gentleman and far too endearingly dorky to be so… aggressive. But it was exactly what Eric wanted to hear, deep down, and it was driving him positively wild. He pressed his nose deep into the pillow, sucking in huge breaths of Clyde’s scent still left there while pumping his cock harder and faster than he’d ever before. “Mate me… rut me… change me, Clyde!” Eric panted, growing more and more aroused by the second until he finally let out a gasp and blew his load all over the bed.<br />
<br />
“S-shit… that was… w-wow,” Eric managed to gasp as he tried to catch his breath. However, his post-orgasmic glow was interrupted by a sudden, unexpected buzzing feeling spreading out from his forehead. It reminded him a bit of a dentist’s drill under heavy anesthetic, painless but still distinctly uncomfortable, and he had a feeling he knew what might have happened. Eric leapt out of bed and ran over to the mirror on the wall and looked at himself, then he let out a groan as he saw what had happened to the tiny stubby antlers he’d grown that morning.<br />
<br />
They were still stubby, but they had grown at least an inch longer and had sprouted the tiniest beginning of a new prong. “<i>Geez, a few more good jerk-off sessions and I’ll have a real nice rack…</i>” Eric thought to himself, running his fingers over the velvety covering of his antlers. As he turned, he caught a flash of brown out of the corner of his eye, then he looked down to see that a short coating of fur had spread out from his tail, covering his butt and upper thighs with the same reddish-brown fur that he currently sported on his ankles.<br />
<br />
“Damn it… I guess any kind of arousal is enough to speed things up,” Eric said, blushing furiously as he realized the consequences of his momentary loss of control. By now, the air in his cabin was positively saturated with the mingled scent of Clyde’s fur and of his own cum, and Eric’s cock was already beginning to stiffen up for a second round. “No, not again, not tonight,” Eric mumbled. He knew that Rudy had said to take it easy and stay in tonight, but with his cabin in its current state there was no way Eric would be able to ‘relax’ without incurring a few more changes to his body in the process.<br />
<br />
No, he’d need to go out for a night on the town. That’s what he’d come to the resort for, after all, right? He quickly wiped up the stain he’d left on the bed as best he could, then he called up housekeeping and asked for his room to be cleaned up and a new set of sheets put on the bed. That shouldn’t take more than a few hours, plenty of time for him to have a little fun and to clear his head.<br />
<br />
As he started to get dressed again, he heard his hooves clopping on the floor once again, then he felt his antlers getting caught on his wool hat as he tried to pull it over his head. “<i>This isn’t going to work. I’m gonna draw too much attention…</i>” Eric thought, then he remembered the magical collar still in his pocket. “<i>…But, maybe one of Santa’s reindeer wouldn’t get too many questions? It would probably be a lot warmer, too.</i>”<br />
<br />
He held the collar in his hands, starting at it intensely as he tried to decide what to do. He knew people would definitely stare at him if he walked outside in his current state, but for all he knew wearing the reindeer collar would make his transformation speed up even more. But, his transformation was already progressing pretty fast, so what was the harm?<br />
<br />
“Oh, screw it. You only live once,” Eric muttered, taking off his glasses and stripping out of his clothes before tossing them aside. He took a deep breath and quickly snapped the collar around his neck, and immediately he felt the warmth of the transformation spreading across his body again. The little antlers on his forehead pushed out into a respectable rack (maybe even a little bigger than before?), and his face pushed outward into a handsome muzzle, with thick reddish-brown fur blooming into existence along every inch of his body. The uncomfortable buzzing sensation returned, this time in his hands, as his bones shifted around and merged into a pair of dark, three-fingered hoof-hands, while down below his cock grew a heavy, fuzzy sheath to protect it from the elements. As the changes settled in, Eric grabbed the shorts and vest that Clyde had given him for modesty’s sake and modeled them for himself in the mirror, shaking his tail playfully as he grinned widely.<br />
<br />
“Looking good… Okay, let’s see what kind of trouble we can get into,” Eric told his reflection. If Eric’s guess was right, Clyde would probably be busy with his work that night, so he probably wouldn’t be recognized by anyone. <br />
<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
Feeling a burst of confidence now that he was in his reindeer disguise, Eric puffed out his chest and headed out of the cabin and down the street, ready to enjoy the attractions of the FoxFire Resort for a couple of hours…</p>
