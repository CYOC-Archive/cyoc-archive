<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle smirked as he saw Jen walking down the hallway.  She was still wearing her cheerleader outfit, which surprised him--a chick with a dick would want loose pants she could hide her cock in, he thought.  But maybe she just hadn&#39;t thought it through.  Fucking stupid blondes.  He&#39;d seen Susan a minute ago, though--he guessed they hadn&#39;t had the chance to meet up yet.  But Jen would have to do something by the end of the day...<br />
<br />
Anyway, he had to hurry.  History was on the other side of the school, and as much as he liked the hard sciences, he wasn&#39;t gonna keep a 4.0 without it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heya!&quot;  Deep in his thoughts, Kyle was completely blindsided when Jasmin body-checked him into the girl&#39;s restroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot;  He asked, furious.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna be late!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Kyle.&quot;  Said Jasmin.  &quot;You&#39;re not gonna need to worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Kyle said, confused.  Jasmin looked...happy.  In the kind of way that shows way too many teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?&quot;  She asked, quickly, and slapped her hand over his mouth.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s eyes widened, and he struggled to move.  But Jasmin had him pinned expertly, and he could barely move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey, don&#39;t worry about me.&quot;  She said, in a voice at once nervous and conversational. &quot;I heard about what you tried to do to Susan and Jen.  They&#39;re helping me out with this.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She waited, and waited...<br />
<br />
The bell rang.  She released his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare!&quot;  He shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late.&quot;  She said.  &quot;You get both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For your transformation:&quot;  Jasmin said, and Kyle felt dread as she spoke. &quot;You&#39;re going to become my penis.  You&#39;re going to shrink down and become a perfectly normal cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked him in the eyes, and she looked excited and nauseous at once as she unbuttoned her jeans, unzipped them, and pulled them down--it was the first view Kyle had gotten of a pussy since he was born, buried as it was under a bush of hair.<br />
<br />
He was terrified.  He couldn&#39;t help himself.  He followed suit, pulling off his pants, his shoes, and then his right sock.  Jasmin looked terrified and excited as he lifted his foot up and brought it even with her crotch.  For a moment, his toes and the ball of his foot rested on the tangle of her pubic hair, and with one big toe he could feel her cleft.<br />
<br />
Her breath shuddering with anticipation, she lowered her own hand to her pussy, and spread her lips apart.  Kyle pushed in.<br />
<br />
Her vagina distended grossly around his foot, even as it felt...comfortable, like stepping into a warm bath and a comfortable shoe at once.  Jasmin didn&#39;t seem to be in any pain, either; she simply leaned against the wall, and her face flushed as she let out a tiny gasp.  Unable to stop, Kyle pulled off his second sock, and holding himself off the ground impossibly, with no more effort than standing on level ground, he stuck his second foot in alongside the first.  Either one should have torn her apart inside.  And neither of them should have been able to hold themselves up, but Jasmin didn&#39;t seem to even waver, as though Kyle weighed nothing at all.  Free for the moment of the compulsion of the curse, Kyle tried to pull himself out of her, only to see his skin and hers fused--her pubic hair actually had already crept up around his ankles.  She no longer even seemed to HAVE a vagina; he emerged from the featureless flesh of her crotch instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for your dare, you&#39;re going be a dick, you might as well think like one.  You&#39;re going to want to get laid.  You&#39;re going to want to fuck women.  And I&#39;m going to feel it, and you&#39;re going to be fine with it, because you want sex?  You&#39;re going to need to get it through me. And we&#39;re going to get laid a lot; you&#39;re going to emit a pheremone that&#39;s going to make all the girls want sex with both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine walked out, her pants still undone, and turned toward her own classroom.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;  Came a call from May, the hall monitor.  &quot;Class started three minutes ago!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot;  Jasmin said, sounding completely apologetic.  &quot;Bathroom emergency!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help!&quot;  Kyle called out.  &quot;Help!  She&#39;s got me glued to her and she&#39;s turning me into a cock!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;...Look, Jazz.&quot;  Said May.  &quot;I&#39;ve let you slide on this like three times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.  Look, I can&#39;t keep pulling your ass out on this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare!&quot;  Kyle called out.  &quot;She&#39;s using Transform or Dare!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ll owe you on this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
May sighed.  &quot;Fine.&quot;  She said.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna call this one in, and you&#39;d better make it worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot;  Said Jasmin.  &quot;Thanks!&quot;  And with that, she took off.  Kyle was in a state of shock.  May hadn&#39;t noticed.  She hadn&#39;t noticed the five-foot-five teenager sticking out of the crotch of the girl with her panties down.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Jasmin&#39;s teacher had left the door open for late students.  She managed to sit down, carefully positioning Kyle so that he was standing on her, in between her chair and her desk.  Curiously, he was still almost weightless, but he did have mass, and she was forced to peek between his legs or around them to see the chalkboard.<br />
<br />
Five minutes into class, Kyle came out of his stupor to notice his change had begun.  His legs had softened, become soft and spongy and hairless, fusing together into an indistinct tube below the knees.  He tried to shake them, to move them, and they did shake.  For a moment he thought he was pulling himself up--possibly even pulling himself free--but even as he rose, he realized his &quot;legs&quot; were not flexing, they were swelling--and hardening.  He  was only experiencing his--and Jasmin&#39;s--first erection.<br />
<br />
He was definitely shorter.  Even erect, he couldn&#39;t be sticking more than four and a half feet out from Jasmin&#39;s crotch.  From this height, he could see down her shirt, and that was his first indication that his transformation into a cock wasn&#39;t the only change Jasmin was experiencing.  As much of a tomboy as Jasmin had been, she&#39;d always had a pretty nice rack, and now...well, he saw her tits;  The bra was fitting loose on her, and her nipples were clearly exposed from this angle.  This was really the best glance he&#39;d gotten at breasts in person in fifteen years.  They might be disappearing, he realized, but for now they were still there, and still round, and the nipples stuck out. <br />
<br />
His legs throbbed involuntarily, and he rocked like a tree in a storm as Jasmin took a deep, calming breath and adjusted her position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Lark, is there a problem?&quot;  Asked the teacher at the front of the class.<br />
<br />
Jasmin pushed Kyle aside to be able to see in front of her, and both she and Kyle flushed a little as she rested her fingers for the first time on her cock. &quot;Ah, no, Mister Grant.&quot;  She said.  Her voice sounded just slightly deeper, husky. &quot;I&#39;m all right.&quot;<br />
<br />
At some point Kyle&#39;s boxers had disappeared.  They hadn&#39;t torn off, they hadn&#39;t fallen off.  He was just aware suddenly of the cool air, and he watched for several minutes the light thatch of pubic hair that had only started to appear in the last year disappeared, his cock fused closed at the tip, and it and his balls lost their definition and disappeared, like candy slowly being licked away.  Like a candy cane being licked, teased with a tongue, a woman&#39;s mouth slipping up and down and up and down...<br />
<br />
Maybe four feet tall now.  He was getting shorter, and his hands were starting to look like stubby mittens on doll arms.  Jasmin, for her part, looked a couple inches taller.  Her jaw looked a little more square, her hair was shorter--the simple ponytail in back had retreated into her scalp enough that the rubber band holding it together in back fell off with a lazy snap and landed on the ground<br />
<br />
Tits.  Kyle was distantly aware that turning into a dick wasn&#39;t something he wanted, but more than that he still saw the mounds on Jasmin&#39;s chest.  He wondered how much of that was just the shape of an empty bra, but he wanted to feel tits at least once, while he could.  Jasmin couldn&#39;t read his mind, but she definitely felt the hormones.<br />
<br />
Tits.  Tits.  Tits.  <br />
<br />
He was on eye level with Jasmin, now.  She looked strongly androgynous, now, and when she spoke she sounded like Kyle had at the beginning of the year.  <br />
<br />
Tits!  <br />
<br />
Kyle swung towards Jasmin, and with one tiny arm held onto her neck and with the other reached down into her shirt to cop a feel.<br />
<br />
Only disappointment waited.  There was a little fat there.  A little padding.  But it was negligible--not a boob by any stretch of the imagination.  Jasmin could have taken off her shirt without anyone batting an eye now, and when Kyle let go--he tried to tell himself that he did it himself, but his &quot;hands&quot; were barely anything now, stubby inflexible paddles with only a little range of motion at the wrists--Jasmin looked at him with a smirk of smug victory.<br />
<br />
The bell went off when Kyle was barely two feet tall.  His arms were tiny, flappy stubs along his side.  He was aware he still had a face--somewhere along the line his heart and his lungs and his gut had become the same hard, spongy mass as his legs, but he could feel warm blood running along the veins beneath his skin, feeding him all he needed.  Besides, for the moment he could still smell and see and was pretty sure he could work his mouth.  <br />
<br />
He had to look up to see Jasmin now.  He couldn&#39;t actually NOT look up, he realized, and he was forced to take note that Jasmin&#39;s chin had the dark hue of stubble, and her arms had taken on hair and muscle tone.<br />
<br />
Jasmin took off down the corridor, and Kyle found himself bounding up and down the entire way.  He was starting to feel sore, he realized, but couldn&#39;t make himself calm down.  He couldn&#39;t relax, and was becoming aware of a tension beneath him as well, something bunched up under where his calves would have been.  At some point, Jasmin had grown a ballsack.<br />
<br />
Jasmin opened a door, and Kyle found himself staring at a plain white ceiling with a light.  She took a couple steps further, and Kyle could see--only out of the corner of his vision, and only for an instant--a row of urinals.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is the boy&#39;s room.&quot;  Jasmin said, and there was nothing girlish about her voice.  &quot;Always wanted to take a look around.&quot;  She looked down at Kyle, and he was only vaguely aware of brightness and dark, now.  He supposed his eyes were mostly gone at this point,and he felt himself involuntarily trying to shrug, or slink away, or hide his face away into SOMETHING that felt like a warm blanket.  &quot;But you&#39;re being trouble. I kind of wanted to break you in after school, but...&quot;  There was the sound of a creak.  A door opened, and then closed, and Kyle was...almost less hearing than simply aware of the rustle of cloth as Jasmin&#39;s pants slipped down to her ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;These things barely fit anymore.  I&#39;ve got a skinny boy-ass now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hand was broad and heavy-fingered, and took Kyle in a strong grip as she sat down on the toilet.  <br />
<br />
Kyle shuddered as her hand slid down him.  Whatever he had slunk away into was suddenly pulled away, and slipped down his length in an erotic, orgasmic rush.  He wanted to gasp, and he felt his jaw trying to work at the same time it was going numb.  Jasmin&#39;s hand slid back up, and the blanket--his foreskin?--slid back over him.  <br />
<br />
He still had hands, but at some point the skin and the flesh beneath had become disconnected, and only felt a little tingle as Jasmin&#39;s hands danced over shrinking, pea-sized bumps.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt good.  He felt AMAZING.  He felt--<br />
<br />
The first pulse of Jasmin&#39;s orgasm caught her by surprise.  Her new balls clenched, something new in her pumped, and a spurt of seed launched out and hit the bathroom stall door. The second spurt hit a bit lower, and Jasmin had to rapidly stand to point her oversized cock at the toilet, running her hand along the shaft a few more times as though she were milking a cow for a few more spurts in the bowl.<br />
<br />
She took a couple deep breaths, and wrinkled her nose at the smell of semen, and took a second to wipe the door with toilet paper and flush it.<br />
<br />
She pulled up her pants--now that Kyle was going soft, and only a little under a foot, she could feet him down a leg--walked out, and then caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Her new body was sexy, she had to admit.  Lean and athletic, a tautly defined set of pecs and a six-pack, virile without being a hairy mess or a nighmarish hulk of a bodybuilder--her armpits had a tangle of black hair that matched the artfully messy mop on her scalp, and she could feel on her lips and chin where she&#39;d need to shave from now on, but she didn&#39;t have a hairy carpet on her chest, and the happy trail of her pubic hair was just barely visible above the beltline.<br />
<br />
She lost track of time, and then something went off in her head, like the bell for class--and she decided it must have been an hour since Kyle had first stepped into her.  She unzipped her pants--somewhere in the last two minutes her panties had mercifully turned into a loose pair of boxers, while her bra had just disappeared--and pulled out Kyle, or at least the cock that had been Kyle.  He was a full eight inches, if not a bit more, and Jasmin wondered how much of a grower he&#39;d be.<br />
<br />
Jasmin wondered whether &quot;he&quot; meant Jasmin or Kyle.  It didn&#39;t matter.  He wasn&#39;t Jasmin anymore anyway.  &quot;Jason&quot; felt better.  <br />
<br />
Jason tucked Kyle away, and grinned into the mirror.  &quot;Susan&#39;s gonna love this.&quot;  He said, loving the rumbling baritone that echoed through the bathroom.  &quot;You and I are gonna get so laiiid.&quot;</p>
