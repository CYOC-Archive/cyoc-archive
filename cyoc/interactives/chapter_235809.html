<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lyn wasted little time basking in the post-orgasm afterglow. Checking the time, she had about thirty minutes until the ceremony started at her sister&#39;s wedding. Lyn hadn&#39;t been invited, of course. Lyn had done so much for her sister, Abby, growing up, been her rock throughout their childhood. Her sister had repaid Lyn&#39;s kindness by going no contact as soon as she left for college. Even at family gatherings, Abby did her best to ignore Lyn. Nothing Lyn did would ever help the situation - Abby made sure their relationship remained at nothing. <br />
<br />
Lyn wasn&#39;t going to give her that choice anymore.<br />
<br />
Lyn stood back up, stretching her four sets of arms as she did. She quickly grabbed a tissue and her clothes, using her bottom left and second-highest right arms to try to clean her cum off. Four other arms grabbed sticks of deodorant and rubbed it into her armpits. Four on the left first, four on the right second.  Eight arms worked towards dressing Lyn simultaneously. Her three upper pairs of arms secured bras on her upper and two lower torsos while her lowest pair slipped on socks and shoes, sitting back in the recliner to finish tying. Then each pair of arms grabbed a special t-shirt: all the comfort of a t-shirt, but with buttons on the front to allow Lyn to put one on each torso. Finally, Lyn grabbed some underwear and athletic shorts, inefficiently waiting while only her lowest pair of arms could finish dressing her while the other six had to wait.<br />
<br />
Checking the clock again, Lyn checked the time - she had only taken 73 seconds to dress herself. Lyn smiled, enjoying the efficiency that came with her new body. Not wanting to waste any time, Lyn headed out the door, jogging straight to her sister&#39;s wedding. Using the address her aunt gave her, the only helpful member of her family, Lyn made her way down Springfield street. Thanks to the curse&#39;s transformation, other pedestrians and drivers didn&#39;t so much as look twice at Lyn, despite her strange humantaur body and eleven-foot height. As long as she remained clothed, other people thought she was normal. Not the luckiest woman on the planet.<br />
<br />
Lyn jogged and jogged faster, trying to get to her sister&#39;s wedding before it ended. She couldn&#39;t fit in a bus with her current body, so Lyn had to make it on foot. Lyn had to keep sticking her arms out, balancing and counterbalancing her very tall body, trying to not to fall over. Nevertheless, Lyn persisted, yearning for her reward.<br />
<br />
Almost an hour of running later, Lyn spotted the wedding venue - a nondenominational church. Reaching the church, Lyn barged into the front door, pushing her way through the heavy wooden doors into the lobby with all eight arms. Trying to catch her breath and following the sounds of the wedding service, Lyn walked towards the church hall. Lyn could hear the pastor talking through the wedding script. Still breathing hard and lightheaded, Lyn pushed the door to the church hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Lyn screamed. The wedding service stopped as she barged in. The pastor, the wedding couple, and every guest looked in shock at Lyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lyn!&quot; Abby screamed, letting go of her fiance&#39;s hands to turn towards Lyn. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Abby&#39;s face twisted from jubilant to hatred in seconds upon seeing her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fixing our relationship!&quot; Lyn screamed back, taking deep breaths as she walked up the aisle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fixing our relationship?!?&quot; Abby yelled. &quot;You ruined it! You ruined my entire childhood by being a narcissistic, psychopathic bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?!?&quot; Lyn laughed at her sister. &quot;This is what&#39;s wrong with the world! Who put those awful ideas in your head? I will - Let go of me!&quot; Two men from the fiance&#39;s family had gotten up and grabbed Lyn&#39;s lowest pair of arms, trying to hold her back from the altar. Lyn grabbed each of them with her middle two pairs of arms, bending over to be able to reach. The men tried to pull her down, grabbing handfuls wherever they could, ripping various items of clothing off Lyn during the scuffle. Lyn, the two men, and three more men who got up to help the first two had successfully pulled Lyn onto the ground, despite Lyn&#39;s best efforts and stream of insults. As they held her down, Lyn felt another part of the transformation activate.<br />
<br />
Looking at her body, Lyn saw that the men had accidentally torn off her bottom two shirts and bras. &quot;Let go of me!&quot; Lyn shouted. This time the five men obeyed, stepping back into the pews. Lyn stood back up, smirking. Looking at the people in the front row, Lyn gestured towards Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring her here.&quot; Lyn commanded. Two of the men from the wedding party obeyed - two of the fiance&#39;s brothers. The brothers grabbed Abby, dragging her down the aisle as she tried to resist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! Stop! James! Dad! Grandpa! Help!&quot; Abby tried calling out for help, from anyone, but a stare from Lyn prevented each person from helping, the curse controlling their mind. The brothers threw Abby onto her knees in front of Lyn. Abby had to look almost straight up to look into Lyn&#39;s eyes. <br />
<br />
Lyn looked into her sister&#39;s eyes, smirking. Lyn issued a command to her sister. &quot;Abby. When I turn around, I want you to pull my ass cheeks apart, then push your head into my asshole. Don&#39;t stop your shoulders touch my ass.&quot; Lyn loved the look of terror, disgust, and hatred on her sister&#39;s face. But Abby had no choice.<br />
<br />
Lyn turned around and pulled her shorts and underwear down. Seconds later, she felt Abby&#39;s hands grasp her ass, pulling them apart and exposing her asshole to the entire wedding ceremony. Then, almost as quickly, Lyn felt her sister&#39;s face pressing into her crack, wet tears smearing onto her ass crack. Lyn felt more and more pressure, until a quick popping feeling as Abby&#39;s head slid into her guts. Lyn let out a deep moan as her sister followed the curse, pushing her head deeper, Lyn felt her sister&#39;s shoulders push up against her rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Bring us up to the altar.&quot; Lyn gestured to the two brothers. &quot;And you.&quot; Lyn pointed at the fiance. &quot;Get her dress off. Its not needed anymore. Cut it off if you have to.&quot; The two men brought Lyn and Abby up to the altar together as Abby&#39;s fiance borrowed a pair of scissors and started to cut his bride&#39;s wedding dress off her body. During the whole process Abby struggled, trying to push Lyn off her shoulders, to remove her head from Lyn&#39;s rear.<br />
<br />
But Abby could not complete her task. The curse made sure of that. <br />
<br />
As the fiance almost finished cutting her wedding dress off, Lyn ordered the two brothers yet again. &quot;Get Abby on her feet. Hold us up.&quot; Following orders, the two brothers grabbed Abby&#39;s arms, pulling her into a standing position. Lyn now sat on Abby&#39;s shoulders, towering even further above everyone. Abby&#39;s arms kept pushing at Lyn&#39;s butt, trying to remove her head, but it was even more pointless now. Even with the help from the two men, Abby could barely support the weight of her sister&#39;s humantaur body. Thirty seconds passed. Then a minute. The two men were clearly getting tired holding up Lyn&#39;s body. But Lyn got her wish.<br />
<br />
As her fiance finished cutting, Abby&#39;s wedding dress fell completely off, revealing nothing underneath. Abby&#39;s chubby body got revealed to all viewers. Her thick thighs, jiggling stomach, fat tits, full brown bush. Nothing could be hidden. As Lyn looked down at her accomplishment, finally putting her bitch of a sister in her place, she felt one of the brother&#39;s slip. Lyn felt herself start to fall, straight down. Abby&#39;s body being in the way didn&#39;t matter at this point. The quick fall ended with Lyn landing on her ass, her lowest torso bulging obscenely, her entire sister now sucked into her body.<br />
<br />
As Lyn lay on the ground, she felt the effects of the curse kick in. Following Lyn&#39;s direction, the curse fused their bodies, permanently. The legs on Lyn&#39;s body transformed into Abby&#39;s thick thighs. Then Abby&#39;s torso appeared, connecting the legs and what used to be Katie&#39;s torso. Finally, Abby&#39;s arms grew out from each side of her torso. Lyn stood up, helped by the two brothers and the fiance, standing on her sister&#39;s former legs, admiring the fifth torso in her collection. Lyn groped at her sister&#39;s tits before feeling around her pussy. The entire wedding audience stared in shock at what had just transpired. Thanks to the curse, all the guests remained solemn, having believed they witnessed some sort of divine ritual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the help, everyone!&quot; Lyn shouted cheerily as she walked off the altar and out of the church, still half-naked. Lyn left the tatters of her sister&#39;s wedding dress on the altar, a symbol of what could have been for Abby. What her life could have been. If Lyn hadn&#39;t gotten the curse, hadn&#39;t run all the way to the wedding. But that hadn&#39;t happened. Abby&#39;s naked tits and stomach jiggled and bounced with each of Lyn&#39;s steps as Lyn walked out of her sister&#39;s wedding.<br />
<br />
Abby had a new place - as part of Lyn&#39;s body, forever.</p>
