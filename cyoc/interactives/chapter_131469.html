<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Lucas entered the house, the smell of years of neglect bombarded his senses. The less than sweet aroma of cigarette buds, alcohol, sweat and probably worse made Lucas want to puke. The decor of the apartment only accented the smell. Random trash was left all over the floor and tables and strange substances had stained the obviously never cleaned carpet. This all had to change, Lucas thought with a gag.<br />
<br />
As they entered into the common room, the foursome was not surprised to find most of the frat in similar states. Most members had some contraband in their hands as they watched their frat president deliver his remarks. As they began to notice the naked man and his twinks, the placid look on their faces quickly turned to sneers out of sheer disgust at their new guests.<br />
<br />
Riley Rider, the thug-like frat president, was the first to speak up. &quot;Ayo, which one of you dumbasses let these fags in here? This meeting wasn&#39;t supposed to have anyone else but us and your brothers,&quot; he explained. Lucas raised an eyebrow as he scanned the seated men. He began noticing the distinction. Many of the first brothers were sitting next to similar looking, slightly younger men. All of them appeared to be old enough to be in college, so this must&#39;ve been an exclusive meeting for the brothers of the frat brothers to potentially pledge. Lucas could barely contain his joy. He couldn&#39;t explain why this had happened, but he also wasn&#39;t complaining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jared, why don&#39;t you show these boys why they should follow your lead and love being on their knees,&quot; Lucas exclaimed in amusement. Jared, almost ready to blow as it was quickly acted on his master&#39;s wishes. As he walked up to the closest two men, a hulking brute with brown hair and his only slightly less buff younger brother, Lucas continued. &quot;Now boys, you won&#39;t hurt my twinks any more than they want to be, right?&quot; he stated with a wink. As Jared wrapped an arm around the older brother named Kevin, the man found his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck you think this is faggot?!&quot; Kevin roared as looked at Jared with pure disgust. &quot;You ain&#39;t doing shit with me. I should beat your fairy asses for coming in here and doing this shit.&quot; He curled up his hand into a fist as he readied his first blow. Without him realizing, however, his hand aimed much lower than expected and uncurled his hand into a palm right as he smacked Jared&#39;s bubble butt. True to Lucas&#39; command, the action shocked Kevin to his core. Years being a drug dealer all on his own vanished as now he was too submissive to handle that responsibility by himself. His younger brother, Dillon, who was currently staring at his thug brother in shock, was the one who had to help him get and sell the meager amounts he could. It wasn&#39;t that their parents weren&#39;t rich; they just wanted even more money, so they couldn&#39;t care less about resorting to less than holy means to get it.<br />
<br />
Kevin was both shocked and angered by what he had done. Clearly, these fags were doing something to him for him to miss like that. Angered and determined, he began spanking Jared forcefully, much to the raven haired twink&#39;s pleasure. Quickly, Kevin&#39;s history was rewritten. Gone were his drug dealing days -- even if he was with someone, he was far too compliant to be in such a business. His notoriety as a bold and cold brute vanished as his timid nature couldn&#39;t possibly allow that. Dillion was now the one who handled the drug dealing. Even their tattoos changed to show it, with Dillon&#39;s becoming more prominent and scary while many of Kevin&#39;s had disappeared.<br />
<br />
As Kevin slowed his spanking (he didn&#39;t have the dominant personality needed to continue), Dillion spoke up. &quot;Bro what the fuck? Are you a fag too?&quot; Dillion asked, clearly angry and embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No bro I swear! I keep trying to punch him but somehow I just can&#39;t. Try it,&quot; Kevin pleaded. As Dillion mimiced Kevin&#39;s actions, he too unable to do more than spank the twink. As he did, he began losing his leadership abilities, as well. Soon, neither of the brothers were able to participate in nefarious deeds. Both were too submissive to do so. They&#39;d probably get kidnapped if they tried, especially with their bulging muscles and overall hot bodies. They only worked out together or with their closest friends as they were too timid to go alone. Overall, they were well on their way to becoming the submissive twinks Lucas wanted.<br />
<br />
More changes were quickly coming, however, as Jared could no longer handle the double spanking the brown haired brothers were giving him. He came in buckets as Kevin and Dillion stopped spanking the twink. They had other plans in mind now. As Derek was still present and happened to be standing right next to the trio, the two brothers began feeling quite aroused and uninhibited. That combined with the fact that had been changed to be more open about their sexualities caused them to decide to take a more active approach to dealing Jared. Kevin rose to stand in front Jared and giggled quite effeminately as he began stroking the twink&#39;s dick. Meanwhile, Dillon cautiously ran a hand down Jared&#39;s back as he used his other hand to insert a finger into Jared&#39;s boypussy. The effect was immediate. Dillion, gaining confidence and losing heterosexuality began to push his finger deeper into Jared&#39;s hole and began pumping more fingers in and out as he used his other hand to feel up the twink&#39;s ass and balls. Meanwhile, Kevin lost nearly all the hair below his neck as his chiseled face became softer and cuter. Even though he had just cum Jared couldn&#39;t take all the hands roaming all over his body and soon came once again all over Kevin&#39;s jeans, not that the brunette was complaining. Now he loved the idea of being covered in cum. He was bisexual now along with his brother, and in their experimentation, he found that he loved everything about cum. He planned to use his family&#39;s cash to create a fragrance that could make sure that he&#39;d always smell his new favorite substance. That is, if Kevin or Dillon could muster up the brain power together to be smart enough to do it. Jared&#39;s latest orgasm caused a fog to develop in the brunettes&#39; heads and it was likely that they wouldn&#39;t even be able to finish their Business majors at this point. Not that they really wanted to anymore. They were much more concerned with learning about the pleasure they were receiving as they played with Jared.<br />
<br />
The rest of the frat was speechless as they watched Kevin kneel before Jared and take a long lick of the twink&#39;s cock. They were even more shocked to watch Dillon, who now preferred Dill, kneel next to his brother and he lick the other side of Jared&#39;s cock, the younger brother&#39;s beard receding as a result. As Kevin began moving towards a combination of licking Jared&#39;s balls and fingering the black haired boy&#39;s hole while Dillion gave the twink a blowjob, one of the frat brothers finally began to find his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what the hell is wrong with you two? Why are you doing this?&quot; he stuttered. The man, named Mark, was horrified at the scene. He and his younger brother, Kyle, were best friends with Kevin and Dill. He knew they were straight, so why were they doing this?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah guys, st-stop it,&quot; Kyle pleaded. Horrified, he watched his best friend&#39;s muscled physique give way to a skinny, lightly toned body while the brunette&#39;s older brother&#39;s hulking mass similarly withered away due to him fondling Jared&#39;s balls and rimming him. Memories of them working hard to achieve their bodies together vanished as now the brunette brothers clearly never went to the gym for another other than swimming. After all, it gave them the cute, toned body they wanted and weights would just ruin it. Mark and Kyle never understood the logic behind it. Not that it mattered; they&#39;d soon be joining them for more than just their swim sessions, as evidenced by their hardening cocks, courtesy of Derek.<br />
<br />
Lucas knew that the blondes who had just spoken up would be their next target, but he wanted to wait until the brunettes&#39; transformations were complete. His wish was soon completed as Jared came a third time, straight into Dill&#39;s welcoming mouth.  Kevy, as he now loved to be called, stopping licking Jared&#39;s ass to fight for some cum as they both cleaned off Jared&#39;s cock. As they did, their transformation finished it&#39;s final touches as they roamed their hands around their hairless bodies (aside from their matching faux hawks), their massive bubble butts and sexy, cute faces. As Jared&#39;s emptied his balls, the gay brunettes began snowballing his load, giggling in high pitched voices as that pawed their each other&#39;s bubble butts. They were both glad that their left cheeks had matching tattoos (Kevy&#39;s reading &quot;Hole 1&quot; and Dill&#39;s reading &quot;Hole 2&quot;) and as they swallowed Jared&#39;s load, the new twinks stared into each other&#39;s brilliant green eyes and giggled uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gawd, that was, like, the best!&quot; Kevy exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally!&quot; Dill responded. He turned to face the rest of the frat, jaws open in shock. Soon they&#39;d be open for cock, Dill thought with a slutty smirk. &quot;Who next?&quot;</p>
