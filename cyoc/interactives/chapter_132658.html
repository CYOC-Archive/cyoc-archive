<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was clear after doing some searching on the forums that something had changed. Sure, there were still posts about conspiracy theories popping up, but every few posts something completely unrelated appeared. The first showed two incredibly small pairs of briefs titled, &quot;Got a big date tonight. Which should I wear? Or should I wear anything at all?&quot;. The next showed a man flexing his massive muscles in a mirror while wearing a tight B&G t-shirt and jeans titled, &quot;Like my outfit ;p&quot;. Johnathan checked on the post, hoping for some form of admonishment. Instead, the top comment said, &quot;Take off the shirt!&quot;, followed by another person saying, &quot;Take off more than the shirt ;D!&quot; By refreshing the page, it was clear that the latter comment would soon win out. What&#39;s worse, Johnathan found himself unconsciously liking the comment. This didn&#39;t make any sense. He knew the man who&#39;d posted the picture of himself and while he&#39;d never seen his face, Johnathan knew the man wouldn&#39;t even wear mainstream clothing, let alone post a picture of himself wearing it. What had changed?<br />
<br />
Johnathan quickly realized he had to remain strong and act fast. It was looking like he might be one of the last sane minds left on the forums. The last of the resistance. Even clicking on actual conspiracy posts only yielded comments about how weak and boring the arguments were. Johnathan shook his head in disbelief as he closed the site. There had to be an explanation. What could&#39;ve caused this?<br />
<br />
His fears got even worse as Dillon and Nicholas entered the room. Both looked like they&#39;d hastily thrown on clothes in an attempt to look presentable. Still, Dillon somehow managed to look incredibly fashionable, wearing matching, bright colors that Johnathan knew he never would have worn a couple days ago. Meanwhile, Nicholas&#39; clothes looked like they were designed to be pulled off in an instant. Hell, there were even snaps along his shorts that could easily pop off, removing the shorts in a matter of seconds if Nicholas wanted. It was madness.<br />
<br />
Johnathan would&#39;ve been surprised at the fact that the two had gone shopping had it not been clear that even his clothes had changed without his doing. More specifically, all he had left in his room were tight tank tops, tiny booty shorts and a massive collection of speedos that were barely covered by the short shorts. Johnathan was not amused, but he was unbelievably turned on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up honey?&quot; Dillon asked innocently. &quot;Why the sudden call?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why the call to action alert?&quot; Nicholas added. &quot;Is that thing really even necessary?&quot; The call to action alert was a concept the four had set up in case the worst was happening. They had all loved the plan before but now support was beginning to waver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicholas, what do you mean? You were the one who thought of it!&quot; Johnathan countered, incredulous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it seems so silly now that I think about it. Besides, we always have our phones on us anyways. You can just call us instead of using those stupid pagers,&quot; Nicholas reasoned, showing the four his brand new smartphone. He always used a flip phone out of safety before, Johnathan thought to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, I called you here because of a very big problem. Something&#39;s changing us. I don&#39;t know what, but we&#39;re all starting to act like dumb faggots and we gotta change that. Fast,&quot; Johnathan explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we do that?&quot; Dillon asked, resisting the urge to paw himself after being called dumb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t know, but if we don&#39;t do something soon, we&#39;re done for. It seems somehow most of the forum&#39;s been affected too, so we&#39;re on our own,&quot; Johnathan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why&#39;s Billy so quiet?&quot; Nicholas asked. &quot;And why&#39;s he wearing a school uniform? Do we even have those? They look hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told him to stop talking, put on some clothes and sit down after he started asking me what my dick looked like. This was the most conservative thing he had,&quot; Johnathan stated, saddened by the fact that an outfit as incredibly slutty as that one was now conservative by William&#39;s wardrobe. &quot;He does whatever people order him to do now, so I made him put it on, even after he tried grinding on me to shut me up. And don&#39;t call him Billy. His name is William.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three boys all seemed slightly disappointed that Johnathan was being such a prude, though they were turned on by Johnathan&#39;s recollection of events. They didn&#39;t truly believe Johnathan&#39;s assessment of the situation. Assuming he was simply overreacting, Dillon was the first to speak up. &quot;So, right now, we don&#39;t have a plan to fix this, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, like, since Bil-- I mean, William, clearly shouldn&#39;t be going outside if he&#39;s that easily controlled, I think Nicholas should stay with him and search the forums while the two of us go outside and search for a solution,&quot; Dillon reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s such a good idea to be splitting up,&quot; Johnathan said anxiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we don&#39;t have any better ideas so, like, let&#39;s go,&quot; Dillon ordered, swishing out the door. Johnathan reluctantly followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay safe, and don&#39;t do anything stupid,&quot; Johnathan pleaded to the other two boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Johnny, we won&#39;t,&quot; Nicholas replied with a wink.<br />
<br />
As the door closed, Nicholas&#39; eyes moved towards William, who stared up at the brown haired man, his eyes pleading for release. There definitely wasn&#39;t going to be any conspiracy theory searching from the two twinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Nicholas began. &quot;You do whatever you&#39;re told now?&quot; William silently nodded his head. &quot;Well, what a nice change from the old Billy. Get up slut. We&#39;re gonna have a lot of fun,&quot; Nicholas stated with a smile as he opened up a new window on the computer. He spanked and groped the raven haired twink as he began searching for the right site on Johnathan&#39;s computer. Meanwhile, Billy could do nothing but let out involuntary moans as he did as he was told and got rewarded for it.<br />
<br />
As the camera turned on along with their stream, Nicholas slipped a finger into Billy&#39;s mouth. They were gonna have tons of fun, Nicholas thought to himself. And once they were done, they would be rich and fully twinks he realized and his cock hardened to begin the show.</p>
