<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the outset of his adventure, Brian then becoming a Percheron horse, learned quickly to act as should a stallion. He did mate with the first mare given to him, and did her several times before he related his forgetfulness of the past as a symptom of his transformation.  Llandros had not made mention as to the minor changes he, Brian would know due to being transformed, but time was on the side of the wizard.<br />
<br />
Day one passed and Brian felt like his old self if but living a heightened sensual existence, he being naked, having a whisking tail, floppy mane, and of course the cock equal the size horse he had become by magic. Life became from the second day being a horse as to awaken, stand, urinate, wait, be fed grain, given a bucket of water to drink, have a bowel movement, wait, stand, wait more, as let out of his stall. Brian watched as a stable&#39;s worker dressed him with leather straps, a head halter, bit tucked inside his mouth, and then harnessed with two other horses of his size for doing work in the farm fields.<br />
<br />
Work was easy when he, Brian was harnessed with two others of equal strength. Although the sun was hot and he did work up a good sweat, by becoming a horse, he an animal, he would do whatever his body metabolism had as a need to expel. Odd to him, but when he would urinate, the odor coming from the foaming frothed puddle he made tended to arouse the two mares he was harnessed to, as they then urinated. The mare urine had its acrid scent and Brian smelling it in the passing breeze, aroused his male sense of lust, causing his cock to become erect. <br />
<br />
Brian would then stand and toy with his massive size horse cock, making it to rise and bump at his furred big belly. The tickle of his body fur to the flared sensual tip of his stallion cock worked to heighten his sense of arousal about wanting to mate with either of the mares in harness with him.<br />
<br />
The man there took note as to the aroused state of the new horse, as Brian was busy trying to masturbate away his emotional state, the man walked up and gave a harsh boot-kick at the male shaft on Brian. The kick had to hurt the stallion, as it worked to cease his thinking about sexual delights and return his mind to the work to be done. Life as a horse became brutal, whether from men or the other horses around him, some becoming jealous would like to bite, kick, or pick a pawing foreleg style of fight.<br />
<br />
Late in the day and the man returned Brian back to the barn, placing him in a corral to cool his body. Brian had there a water trough to drink from, but was left as alone, no mare to fancy his cock with some wild sensual frolicking. It was after dusk when the stables man came to get Brian and lead him into the barn as to his stall. <br />
<br />
Again in what had become by scent know to Brain as his stall, he was fed a ration of grain for his working that day. He had water in a bucket to drink and given a quarter bale ration of hay to munch before feeling tired, he might lie down in the straw covering the stall floor for a night of deep, restful slumber.<br />
<br />
As so it began and continued for Brian, this his existing as a horse, a Percheron draft animal, and he feeling the nagging want of being a stallion to mate then a mare. Brian found much time to stand and think, trying to compare his present self to what little he recalled of when he was a human, he living a human lifestyle. Brain felt bored by being a horse, he but an animal, something less than human in so many ways.<br />
<br />
Sensuality had helped to lead Brian into accepting what Llandros wanted of Brain to become. The delight of a becoming fun fantasy existence was, from the daily existence as a horse and stallion, fast dwindling to a life of animalistic drudgery. <br />
<br />
Llandros the wizard left then Brian to be, live as to what he had become, doing whatever felt natural, as nagged by the sense of fantasy suggested of what it might be like from becoming a male stud horse. Indeed, Brian had become a male horse and used as a stud to breed mares there at the farm. Sexual frolicking and the deep felt thrusting tantalized Brian at the beginning to his becoming a stallion, and was a constant for him to wish as want whenever the situation came his way.<br />
<br />
Although the sense of becoming an ignorant animal was edging Brian ever closer to the kind of indignity Llandros wanted Brian to live, he would so often dream dreams while asleep. Dreaming then of times in his past when Brian the human felt pride for being alive. Llandros if he thought about Brian would see into the degrading mind and view there the dreams what the stallion would recall and relish remembering. As days became weeks and weeks turned into months, Brian tried harder at remembering his fun times when human, and forget the dire indignity it was for him to feel and deal with by being a horse, an animal used by men for some menial purpose.</p>
