<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke stepped out onto the floor of the gym. He felt intimidated for a moment, once more in his mind being the scrawny, unimpressive young man he had been just that morning. Less than a day with the bracelet and he was unrecognizable. He had his face still, sure, from the neck down he was so different. He looked at his pale arms which almost glowed under the artificial florescent lighting.<br />
<br />
One guy was walking his way back to the lockers. Not too tan, just a bit sun-kissed. Hopefully it was real and not spray on. He moved aside enough for the other guy just enough that their arms still brushed against each other, thinking of copying his skin tone. A moment later, his pale skin was taking on the same slightly golden hue. Perfect.<br />
<br />
He may have gained muscles, but he couldn&#39;t siphon of knowledge, and while most of the machines seemed straight forward, others looked like nonsensical torture devices. One thing he did know though was the weights. A few months of weightlifting in gym in high school at least taught him how to use the things, even if he had never really put it to use.<br />
<br />
He looked at the stack of free weights curiously. Unsure of which to even start with. Maybe just begin light and test them until he figured out where he was, then he noticed someone moving onto the bench press set. It was the man who had been eyeing him in the locker room. His black hair was long enough to tuck behind his ears, with a natural loose curl, jaw scruffy, his tank top scooped low enough to show off a hairy but trimmed chest. He wasn&#39;t as muscular as Luke was now, but it was a close thing. &quot;Need a spotter?&quot; Luke asked with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping you would ask.&quot; The man&#39;s English was perfect, though he did speak with a slight accent. Definitely Italian if Luke didn&#39;t miss his guess. He had already set up the barbell with weights and he leaned back as Luke took up position at the top of the bench. &quot;I&#39;m Gio.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, Luke.&quot; The the way the Italian purred his name it almost sounded like Lucca. Where Luke was standing and Gio laying gave the man a perfect vantage point to stare right at Luke&#39;s bulge, something he was taking advantage of. And as Gio began his reps, watching him work out caused Luke&#39;s bulge to just become even more obvious. But watching him work out also gave Luke an idea of what to do when they switched spots, refusing to add more weight when Gio asked.<br />
<br />
From there they did most of their work out together, Gio unknowingly guiding Luke through looking like he knew what he was doing. He also got closer to Luke as time went on, taking excuses to touch him on the arm, or brush up against him. Luke considered maybe copying something from Gio, maybe learning what it felt like to have such a hairy chest, but decided not to, just enjoying actually getting attention from a handsome man for once.<br />
<br />
By the time the two were in the showers they were flirting more openly, and Gio was no longer trying to catch subtle looks at what hung between Luke&#39;s legs, he was outright staring. He should write Dennis a thank you note for the cock he thought. Gio himself was a bit above average, but Luke was just plain old hung. There were others around, and the gym had rules unfortunately, so they kept from fooling around in the showers, but it was clear where the night was going.<br />
<br />
Outside the gym, Gio only made vague allusions to saying good bye to walk back to his apartment, and Luke offered him a ride. It was a song and dance, one Luke had dreamed of having. Ten minutes later they were almost falling into Gio&#39;s apartment, lips pressed together, hands eagerly pulling at each other&#39;s clothes. They barely had the foresight to close the door before they were stumbling through the living room shedding the last of their garments to the floor.<br />
<br />
Gio pushed Luke back onto the couch, then straddled his lap. Their erections pulsed up against each other, shafts rubbing together as Gio continued to occupy Luke&#39;s mouth with his own. Luke held onto Gio&#39;s hips as the other man continued to grind against his lap, hands gripping Luke&#39;s shoulders. No hands were needed, not for this. Pleasure shot through him at the feeling of having Gio&#39;s cock rubbing up against his, slick pre mixing and lubricating their manhoods.<br />
<br />
Eventually twin volcanoes erupted between them, hot cum pouring down over their cocks as they drifted in mutual bliss, mouths still locked in a prolonged kiss. Gio rolled off of Luke&#39;s lap, taking a seat on the couch next to him. &quot;You are a very sexy man, Lucca.&quot; Gio said, his accent a slightly bit more noticeable as he pressed himself up against Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s how you say my name.&quot; He responded with a languid smile, muscular chest rising and falling in deep breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you hungry? I can make us some dinner.&quot; Gio&#39;s hand drifted down Luke&#39;s chest and stomach, then down to cup his balls. &quot;You&#39;ll be providing dessert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke shivered, then nodded.</p>
