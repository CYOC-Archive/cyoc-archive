<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel got up and began unbuttoning his shirt. Sweat pouring down his face.<br />
&quot;It's so hot in here...&quot; he whined.<br />
He tossed his shirt off, his wife beater was completely drenched. He peeled it off and tossed it on top of his <br />
shirt. I saw his biceps swell out slightly, as two more mounds appeared below them.<br />
Daniel downed the rest of his drink before going to get another one. Butch sniffed the air when he returned, <br />
Daniel paused when he looked at Butch. He drank in the sight of the dog. He stared long and hard at Butch's <br />
cock, the red tip was peaking out, and his own member tented in his jeans.<br />
&quot;It's so damn hot!&quot; Daniel undid hid pants, pulling both them and his underwear off. Butch got off the couch <br />
and walked over to him.<br />
All at once, Daniel realized what he was doing. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; he tripped over Butch as he reached for his <br />
clothes, and butch was on top of him before he could get up.<br />
&quot;Hey! bad dog! dude! get your mutt off me!&quot; Butch probed Daniel's ass and finally penetrated him. Daniel's <br />
cries were soon replaced by moans of pleasure as they rocked back and forth.<br />
Daniel winced as his spine lengthened, a new tail forced it's way out. His hands closed into tight fists, the <br />
digits melted into his hands. His socks, which were the only clothing left, were stretched out as his feet <br />
lengthened. I watched the socks slip off. The ball of his foot grew pads, while the rest of his foot thinned <br />
out. he stumbled as his legs shorted. His legs looked very much like dog legs. Daniels yelped as dark claws <br />
ripped out of his knuckles, and let out a whine when more claws pushed his toenails out. The back claws <br />
rearranged, his big toes moved up his legs and became dew claws.<br />
Butch continued pumping as Daniel looked at me pleadingly:<br />
&quot;Wh-what's happening?! Help! Please... help me... ooOOOHH!&quot; Daniel's pleas were silenced as Butch pounded <br />
faster. I looked underneath Daniel, at his dick. Even though it was rock hard, it was only 1 inch long! I <br />
watched it pull into him. Daniel let out a cry of pain as his balls were pulled in with a sickening pop. Butch <br />
pulled out and sat back. A vagina formed, releasing the scent of a bitch in heat.<br />
&quot;You... you did this didn't you?! you sick-AAHHHOOOOOOOooo...!&quot; His chest pushed out, ribs cracked and organs <br />
moved around. his teats moved down to his stomach, they swelled with milk for the pups that would be coming. <br />
brown and black Fur grew down his back, and covered his body. He was now a German shepherd bitch from the neck <br />
down. Daniel collapsed on the floor. He lay there, as he unconsciously began panting.<br />
&quot;Did you like it?&quot; I asked. Daniel got up on, and looked at me with a mixture of anger and fear.<br />
&quot;Yoooo sick bastard!&quot; He barked, his speech had become more like growling. &quot;It was yooo! Loook at me! I'm a <br />
freak! Why the fuck would yoo think I'd like that?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, That is your girlfriend over there. Whoops, I guess He's your mate now.&quot;<br />
Daniel stared at Butch in shock. &quot;Th-that's yooor motherrr?! What did yoo-?&quot;<br />
Daniel stoped as Butch mounted him again.<br />
&quot;Noo! Dearrr, yoo in theirr? It's me Dan-&quot; Butch found Daniel's new hole, and began again.<br />
Daniel's pleas were short lived. I watch as fur spread up to his face. His jaw lurched forward with a loud <br />
crack. It continued pushing forward, teeth grew in to fill the gaps in his mouth. His head began to reform, He <br />
winced as his skull shrank. He looked at me with panic and fear, before his eyes glazed over, turning brown <br />
with a blank expression. His mind was gone.<br />
I watched butch banging away at his new mate. 'Danielle' was panting contently, rocking back and forth with <br />
each of her mate's thrusts. Butch howled as he came inside her. The two of them laid down and licked each <br />
other. I went over stroked the coats.<br />
&quot;There! now you two can still be together&quot; They both wagged their tails before falling asleep, still knotted <br />
together.<br />
*********************<br />
After the pups were born, I sold them off to people for a good price. After I sold the last one, I thought <br />
about what else I could do. I pondered changing the dogs back into my mom and her boyfriend, but I also wanted  <br />
mess around with them some more.</p>
