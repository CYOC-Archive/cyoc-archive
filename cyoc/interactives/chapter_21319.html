<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Here we are. My name's Miss Bussell, by the way,&quot; she explained, smiling, as she lifted a box up from under the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here are your two dresses, Tara. They are to be won for one day only and each one is to be washed immediately the next day. You can either do that in the laundry room or when you've picked up on the skills of the course sufficiently.&quot; With that she placed two plastic packs on the table with blue and green tartan cloth in. They really didn't look big.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now here are your regulation shoes. Size 3 as per the form you signed. These are to be kept polished. There is no need in Stonewood to wear socks or tights. We have our own heating. Likewise we have regulation underwear,&quot; she said, placing another packet on the table. Inside were a collection of black slips which looked just a bit too sexy for a school. Mind you, I was 16 and getting senior. Another packet soon joined them containing bras. &quot;Thank God for that,&quot; I thought, &quot;I hadn't noticed the strain on my chest but I don't think I could have handled it all day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Miss Deane. That is your uniform. Your academic equipment and all you should need will be provided in classes. All that remains now, prior to the personal belongings check in your dorm later is to check you have all your extra-curricular equipment.&quot; Whatever this could be confused me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are an active young lady,&quot; Miss Bussell said. &quot;We are very lucky to have you. Now, here is the cheerleading uniform. You'll need this for the practice and will have to hurry as you need to be on the field in ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
What had Mark been playing at? He'd clearly stitched me up. What other unpleasant delights was he going to inflict on me, as if making me a clone of my step-mom wasn't enough?<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll need these plimsolls too and this sport-bra. For the swim squad we have a new uniform now. The boys would love it if they were allowed to watch. It's the first two piece in Stonewood's history.&quot;<br />
<br />
Great. Now I'd be flaunting in the swimming pool too. It was a good job this wouldn't last for long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, Mr Rodling has asked me to thank you for auditioning for the play. He's giving you a copy of the text and thinks you'll make a splendid Juliet.&quot;<br />
<br />
What? That sadistic idiot was going to push me into being a Juliet!? Before I could even properly deal with this I was being hurried out of the hall, carrying a box of girl's clothing and off to cheerleading practice.<br />
<br />
Having found the locker room, I took the cheerleading uniform out of its plastic and laid it on the bench. It was tiny. Slowly slipping out of Mark's clothes - the thought of him excited me again - I struggled to get on the sports bra Miss Bussell had provided me with. I just couldn't reach behind these globes were so big. In the end I had to fasten it at the front and slip it round so it fit.<br />
<br />
I truly felt the last vestiges of my former masculinity fall away from me as I slipped the tiny skirt up my legs. They were beautifully curved, and the bronze tan perfectly contrasted the red and white skirt. As I wriggled it into place over the school underwear I felt a shiver of electricity through my body. I was so sexy and I knew it. Putting my arms through the holes on either side of the sweater I pulled it on properly positioned it carefully below my breasts. I was really quite nervous. I wasn't used to exposing my body much as a guy, but as such a fit younger version of my step-mom this was just a mind-trip. Fastening my sneakers I trotted out onto the field.<br />
<br />
I stopped and looked at the cheerleaders who were lining up and doing their stretches. I have to admit I watched with more than a little interest, grinning slightly at the thought that in spite of what I looked like I was definitely still partly Roger inside.  Then with a sigh, I glanced down at myself and knew that I'd have to take care of that a little better before giving herself away. I hoped my Simone's great cheerleading skills at school would somehow still be remembered in this body.<br />
<br />
I started nearly skipping towards where the others were. Bizarrely I was feeling lighter and more energetic than I'd ever really felt in my life.  I even giggled again, feeling sort of bubbly inside and joined in with the stretches. The part of me that was girl was really enjoying this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you made it.&quot; one girl said with a friendly grin. &quot;My name's Sandra.&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned back at the girl, at least I'd have one friend. She did look familiar though. Then I realized who it was. It was Sandra from my old college who'd teased me mercilessly about being small! But this time as I looked at her, I no longer felt hostile towards <br />
this girl.  Not in the least. I must be succumbing to Simone's female and slightly bitchy side!<br />
<br />
It was a tough start. I really struggled to learn what this body wanted to do, but as practice went on, I threw herself into all the exercises with great enthusiasm. I couldn't get found out. It seemed I was impressing the coach too. I hate to say it, but part of me definitely enjoyed it! It was surprisingly fun and exciting.<br />
<br />
Finally the coach, a tall thin woman that had been yelling and screaming at them during practice, she blew her whistle. &quot;All right girls,&quot; the coach yelled, &quot;you did pretty good today.  You just might make it as cheerleaders after all.&quot; I grinned, feeling oddly proud of myself. I could do this and pass off being a girl until that idiot Mark got things together. I grinned over at Sandra, who was busy adjusting her sports bra and didn't seem to notice. Then I looked up and noticed that there were several boys on the bleachers watching her and the others. I couldn't help but blush furiously for a moment again. They must have been watching the whole practice. At the thought of some of the things that I'd just done, I blushed even more. But what was worse, I wasn't sure whether the thought of all them watching my body made me more embarrassed, or more excited. Gazing at them, two seemed very familiar. They may even have been the ones I saw on the stairs. One thing was for sure though, this body was interested in boys. The sight of their pumped chests, flecks of hair glinting the sun on tanned necks and shoulders and a firm chin on those two in particular sent a thrill through me. Mark better get this sorted out soon.<br />
<br />
The with a loud sigh, Sandra told me, &quot;I guess I'll see ya later.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wondered over to the locker room, and half-way...</p>
