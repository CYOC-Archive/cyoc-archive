<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ellie rushed off, spotting her friend Jenny among the crowd,<br />
“See ya bubbles!” She said, blowing a kiss at James teasingly. Of course, James knew much better than her that she was more than embarrassing herself already. Nobody would be able to tell that either of them had changed, but that didn’t change the fact that people acted differently around them. James could just feel the stares at his butt as people walked past, even with his loose fitting jeans he’d selected for just this reason. He shrugged, maybe he can get rid of it soon, but who really cares. He walked his way up the steps and into the High School in search for his locker.<br />
<br />
Ellie approached her friend Jenny, calling out her name,<br />
“Jenny!!” She yelled, causing a number of people to look over at her,<br />
“O-oh Ellie!” Jenny replied, immediately looking at Ellie’s belly,<br />
“W-what’s up with the clothes?” She asked, seeing her belly button in complete view of everyone, “shrink in the wash?”<br />
“That’s what I thought!” Ellie replied, “I just woke up and nothing was fitting…” she looked as if she was figuring something out, but before anything could come to mind,<br />
“So how’s Seth?”<br />
“Good question,” Ellie said, “I haven’t spoken to him since yesterday. I mean I’m pretty sure he’s good, but I should totally find him… I wish he was right here!” Ellie announced, pausing for a moment as if something was going to happen,<br />
“Huh,” Jenny said, looking a little puzzled, “what about James?”<br />
“Yeah yeah, James is good,”<br />
“Feeding you well,” Jenny joked, laughing at herself. Ellie instinctively punched her in the arm,<br />
“Not funny…” Ellie said, kind of smiling at the remark, “what can I say, I’m just always hungry! I can’t really help it,”<br />
“I’ll buy you a candy bar at lunch if you let me talk to James?” Jenny bargained,<br />
“Done!” Ellie said, holding out her hand and shaking Jenny’s. She knew Jenny had a huge crush on James, but even more she knew James was far from interested. He’d had his eyes set on one specific girl for over two years…<br />
<br />
“Elizabeth Mitchell,” James said, shutting his locker as she walked past,<br />
“Wow,” a voice said, shutting a locker beside him, “could you sound any more starstruck?”<br />
“I-It’s not…” James tried to excuse, but failing, “you can’t blame me, just look at her!” He said, admiring her as she eventually walked behind a corner,<br />
“You’re into every red-head, I swear,” the friend said,<br />
“Get over it, Nick,” James said, “you can’t pretend you’re not into EVERY guy with glasses,” he shot back,<br />
“Y-y… yeah you got me there,” Nick laughed. He took a glance at James’ butt, “seriously man…” he said, now staring, “Elizabeth might be hot, as far as I hear, but she’s got nothing on your posterior!” He joked, clearly deciding whether or not to slap his friends ass,<br />
“Don’t do it,” James said, being serious, “I get enough of that from Ellie,”<br />
“I don’t blame her,” Nick said, “I’m sorry man, I don’t mean to keep talking about it. But it’s pretty hard to ignore. I mean if I had that grand of an ass I’d never shut up about it!”<br />
“Really?” James asked, intrigued,<br />
“Seriously!” He replied, “I just feel like the attention would be amazing!”<br />
“You really sure about that?” He asked again, “I mean speaking to someone with first-hand experience?”<br />
“Yeah yeah, but it’s different!” Nick said, “I think it’d serve me a lot better than it serves you,”<br />
“Alright, makes total sense,” James said, made up his mind, “I’ll see you later, I gotta go find Ellie,”<br />
“Totally man, see you!” Nick said, locking his locker and going on his way.<br />
James began walking in the opposite direction but stopped, turning back around. Nick was still walking,<br />
“I wish Nick’s ass grows twice the size of mine, and mine goes back to normal… with appropriately fitted jeans,”<br />
Within a moment, James felt his ass shrinking. The stares began to fade, appearing on a different ass. Nick’s ass started swelling like a balloon, almost tearing his shorts at the seams. Luckily they were baggy, but something to note next time. It grew and grew until it was so big that each movement caused an immense jiggle across his body,<br />
“Finally,” he said.<br />
<br />
Ellie continued talking to Jenny about boys, specifically Seth, as all Jenny wanted to talk about was James. Ellie hated talking about James in a romantic way, it was just weird. Even though there was a magical reason why Ellie and James were sexually repulsed by each other, it was still way too awkward talking about him with anyone.<br />
“Do you think James would find me hot if I—”<br />
“Dude!” Ellie called out, “no I don’t… I’ve said to you (and him) that it’d be weird if you dated. He’s not into you, seriously!”<br />
“Yeah yeah,” Jenny continued, “but I’m saying hypothetically, do you think he’d find it hot if I had a button or two undone?” She suggested,<br />
“You literally don’t have any cleavage,” Ellie said, being completely realistic,<br />
“But boys like skin showing, right?”<br />
“I’m telling you, for the millionth time, it’s a pointless battle. He’s just not into you,”<br />
“Alright alright,” Jenny said, seemingly admitting defeat, but then suddenly springing back with, “so let’s say I got implants,”<br />
“Oh my god…” Ellie said, wanting to dissolve into a puddle of awkwardness,<br />
“I’m not saying just James! What about like, other boys. Would Seth find me sexy?”<br />
“WHAT!?” Ellie yelled, <br />
“Whaaaat?” She complained, “if I can’t talk about James who else am I supposed to talk about?”<br />
“ANY OTHER BOY!!” Ellie said, angered, “you always pick either my boyfriend or my best friend! Can’t you just pick someone else,”<br />
“Ugh,” Jenny said.<br />
There was an awkward silence between the both of them. Clearly Jenny had stepped over a line she was not supposed to, and she just continued walking. She’d seen the error.<br />
“L-look…” Jenny said, “I’m sorry. I just got a little crush,” she assured, “I swear, I’m not actually gonna take it anywhere,”<br />
“Thank you,” Ellie said, appreciating the apology,<br />
“But really,” Jenny said, looking at Ellie seriously. She took her hands and squeezed the very minuscule breasts she had together, creating a very faint impression of cleavage, “implants or no?” She joked.<br />
The girls laughed and talked for another few minutes, but Ellie had a good idea.<br />
“I wish Jenny had implants, pretty big ones,” she said under her breath.<br />
As Jenny continued talking, Ellie noticed that Jenny’s chest began to rise and a fair cleavage began to form between her breasts. They were round, large, and almost perfectly shaped. Jenny never wore a bra for her breasts had always been very small, so her nipples poked out like sore thumbs underneath her shirt,<br />
“Getting a little distracted?” Jenny asked, looking down at her cleavage, “I’m tempted to go up a few sizes as well!”<br />
“W-wow…” Ellie said, speechless at seeing her previously flat chested friend sprout two silicon boobs,<br />
“I know it’s expensive and everything, and they can be a little tricky with some chests, but I’d recommend them any day!”<br />
“Y-yeah, I mean they look… great! Really great…” Ellie said, looking down at her own chest. Fairly sized, but mostly because of the weight she’d gained.<br />
<br />
“Ellie!” James called, running to his best friend. As he arrived, he suddenly heard the school bell ring signalling that there were five minutes until class began,<br />
“Oh god…” Ellie said, knowing what was about to unfold. James arrived in front of his best friend. He looked to Jenny,<br />
“Hi,” he said, out of breath, “do you mind if I talk to Ellie alo- woah…” he said, taken aback by Jenny’s suddenly larger chest, “d-did… or am I… Ellie?” He asked,<br />
“Yes, yes, and yes,” Ellie replied, “sorry Jen, I’m gonna have to talk to James alone. We have a few things we need to discuss,”<br />
“Alright,” Jenny said, staring at James. He was almost unable to look away from the perfect breasts in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Eyes!” Ellie called, snatching his attention to her,<br />
“R-right, sorry!” James replied awkwardly, “just a boy thing, y’know… and you totally did that right?”<br />
“Of course I did,” Ellie said, “and don’t you dare judge me for it,”<br />
“I’m not,” James said, “in fact, I gotta tell you to look out for Nick Mulligan. I kinda sorta traded my ass with him, and made his twice as big as mine was,”<br />
“Really!?” Ellie said, a smile appearing on her face, then suddenly a frown, “wait, I thought we agreed you’d keep the butt until I said otherwise,”<br />
“We did. Yes,” James said, “but our main goal was to mess with people, right?”<br />
“Yeah, I know,” Ellie said, “but to make it even again, I wish you had implants twice the size of Jenny’s!”<br />
James’ eyes went wide, preparing for the imminent.<br />
But nothing. Suddenly he burst out laughing,<br />
“It’s not your turn!” James said with a wide grin on his face, “so that means its mine… and I wish…” he stopped to think, Ellie prepared for him to say anything, but instead, “no no, actually I changed my mind. I’m saving it,”<br />
“What!?” Ellie said in surprise,<br />
“Our first period is History, and it’s both of us together, and you’re not gonna know what hit you until I wish it!”<br />
<br />
“God you’re such a dork,” Ellie said,<br />
“Oh you’re gonna love what I have planned,” James said, ruffling Ellie’s hair like an older sibling.<br />
<br />
“You guys done yet?” Jenny asked,<br />
“Yeah, we are,” Ellie said, breaking from James. James looked at Jenny, once again glancing at her cleavage, but keeping his eyes to himself. Jenny had a devilish smile on her face. Ellie watched all of this… maybe this wasn’t so bad after all. She could use this to her advantage.<br />
<br />
Ellie, James, and Jenny walked to their History class, preparing for a boring class… but maybe not so much today of all days.</p>
