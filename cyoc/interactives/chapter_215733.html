<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I cobbled this together from Butterbonerbob&#39;s stuff. Sorry if it&#39;s not very good, but I liked this branch.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Briaden left the sauna, hole feeling nice and raw after being properly plowed by his master.<br />
<br />
He was sweating up a storm and went to the showers. The water was nice and warm, and Braiden found himself basking in the stream of refreshing water as it sluiced away the cum and grime from his rough skin. His hands roamed over his form, enjoying the familiar yet, at the same time, unfamiliar hairy hills and valleys of his burly body.<br />
<br />
Bull might be a slave to a pervy old man, but he was a happy, good-looking slave, at least.<br />
<br />
Still, you realize, maybe now might be a good time to get out of this body. Like, right now, before Braiden’s master farms Bull’s cowhole out to a bunch of bears to plow. Even as you thought that, you see the two older men and Braiden’s master look into the showers and walk your way.<br />
<br />
It was now or never.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want...&quot; you say in Braiden’s deep voice, only to be overwhelmed by a sudden desire, to wait here in the shower for those guys to come in and plow him from both ends--No! <br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to...&quot; go lift weights, pack more muscle on this massive form. Being Bull was amazing, the muscles, the hair! Why would he give it up to go back to being boring old you? His master would be so fucking happy, maybe he’d even let him out of the cage-<br />
<br />
No!<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be ignored!&quot; You finally managed to shout.<br />
<br />
Bull’s whispers dissappeared along with the huge muscles and body hair as the suit deflated. <br />
<br />
The ruddy, rough skin shimmered and shifted into that same strange, light, rubber material. Soon, you were standing in the showers, the boiler-suit limp, hanging off your body. Thankfully it was waterproof or it would be soaked.<br />
<br />
You breath a sigh of relief and pass by the two older men, who were still eyeing you with lust.<br />
<br />
Going back to your locker, you unzip the suit. Underneath was a skimpy, pale-pink stringer tank with a grinning bear on it giving the world a thumbs-up. Below that were your favorite white athletic shorts that clung to your hips and ass tightly. <br />
<br />
You carefully stepped out of the suit and folded it up.<br />
<br />
“You are very scary to work with,” You say to the suit and place it on the bench behind you.<br />
<br />
That thing was only safe to use in a controlled environment. You’d have to tell Jack about it when you got back to his shop. Using it at the gym like that had been reckless as hell.<br />
<br />
You turn to use the sink and smacked directly into a husky middle-aged man, who almost dropped his phone in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry, young man!” The man’s voice was familiar and you looked up.<br />
<br />
“Unlce Jack?” You say in disbelief as the older man fumbled with the device in his hands.<br />
<br />
He was wearing a loosely-belted terrycloth robe, the sides open after the collision. <br />
<br />
You can see your Uncle&#39;s bare torso through the gap in the robe. He had a pair of softly rounded pecs and a small, hairy beer belly. Jack was handsome and had a well-padded dadbod, and you guessed that he might be a perfect silver daddy bear one day if things kept going the way they were.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my apologies,” Jack said, glancing up at you without a hint of familiarity in his eyes. “Didn’t see you there, young man.”<br />
<br />
He sidesteps around you, focusing back on the device in his hands. You noticed it wasn’t a typical phone, but instead an arcane, mechanical device, with multiple silver compass arrows and cogs whiling and spinning in all directions.<br />
<br />
“Damn piece of junk!” Jack mumbles to himself whacking the back of the contraption a few times.<br />
<br />
Wait, why didn’t he recognize you? <br />
<br />
You glance back at the folded suit on the bench behind you. He’d said it was still a prototype! Had it altered reality? But you weren’t a huge muscled bull anymore, so that couldn’t be it. What might have happened? <br />
<br />
Maybe Jack would know?<br />
<br />
“Um..sir?” You ask, “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
Jack barely spared you a glance.<br />
<br />
“If you must know something was taken from my shop and I’m trying to track it down.” Jack said, then went back to observing his device.<br />
<br />
As he walked past the bench the suit was on, Jack’s device made a loud noise, whirling, beeping, and emitting smoking.<br />
<br />
“Ah! So it was the prototype,” Jack said, picking the suit up. “Man, this thing is dangerous!”<br />
<br />
“Why is it dangerous?” You ask, suddenly cautious.<br />
<br />
“Well, the enchantment isn’t stable.”<br />
<br />
“Right, the multiversal refraction is too perfect.” You reply off-handedly, recalling what your uncle had muttered. “It can alter reality by projecting an alternate version of yourself or a possible existence that might fit in with…”<br />
<br />
You trail off. <br />
<br />
Uncle Jack is staring at you in shock. Right, you forgot that the suit had made him forget you were his nephew. That was all the more reason you needed to convince hi to help you.<br />
<br />
“You..how do you know that?!” Jack sputtered. “I haven’t even told the other wizards about-!”<br />
<br />
“Jack you old horn dog!” The old man from before shouted, his green eyes twinkling as he bustled over to where the two of you were standing.<br />
<br />
Jack sighed and turned around “Hello Randolph...”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t seen you in years!” Randolph wraps an arm around Jack’s back, but a fair bit lower than one might do for a platonic friend “When was the last time we saw each other?”<br />
<br />
“When you invited me to that sex party,” Jack responded stepping away, “and after pleasuring you and all your nasty pals, I asked someone to return the favor and none of them were interested.”<br />
<br />
“Come now don’t tell me you still hold a grudge?” Randolph pulled out a water bottle and casually took a sip. “That was just a little miscommunication.”<br />
<br />
“Miscommunication!” Jack huffed angrily. “Was it a ‘miscommunication’ when you told all of them you were bringing a, and I quote, ‘cock-hungry cumhole’? I saw the group chat afterwards.”<br />
<br />
“Where’s the lie? You took all of those cocks like a champ. It was like some kind of sorcery.” Randolph replied, eyes lost in reminiscence. “And I can’t help it if you were too much of a pushover to ask for a blowjob *before* sucking off a dozen old men.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a pushover!” Jack growled a bit too loudly from the other room before his voice softened. “I was...just being polite.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, just being polite, didn’t enjoy it at all.” Randolph chuckles “That’s why you were rock hard the whole time.”<br />
<br />
“You were the one who told me I should save my load for a month before the party!” Jack grumbles. “And then you snapped a cock cage on me!”<br />
<br />
“A lot of cock sluts love that sort of thing,” Randolph shrugged, “how was I supposed to know you’d be so vanilla. Though how you managed to wriggle out of that thing without the key I’ll never know.”<br />
<br />
“And afterwards,” Jack continues, “I found out you were charging all of them money and favors for *my* blowjobs.”<br />
<br />
“What, you’ve never heard of a finder’s fee?”<br />
<br />
Jack rolled his eyes. “I see you haven’t changed a bit”<br />
<br />
“It’s changed about as much as your fashion sense,” Randolph reaches down and opens Jack’s robe, “Still like to go bare under there eh?”<br />
<br />
Jack’s face reddened and he pulled his robe together. “I’m not in the mood, Randolph!”<br />
<br />
“Ok, okay, so I take it you haven’t come back to see me.” Randolph gave his bulge a quick adjustment. “And clearly you’re not here to work out. So why are you here?”<br />
<br />
“For… “ Jack turned his attention back to you, “something that went missing. But I found it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Randolph said, hustling over to you and throwing a hairy arm over your shoulder, “I completely forgot to introduce you to someone. Jack, this is Braiden, my grandson!”<br />
<br />
Wait, you were still Braiden?<br />
<br />
And did Grandpa Randy just call you his Grandson?<br />
<br />
You turn to the mirror above the row of sinks next to the lockers and stare in shock at the reflection looking back at you.<br />
<br />
The person in the mirror was clean shaven, face cute and boyish with a smattering of freckles that made his green eyes sparkle, his chestnut hair in a stylish short cut. A dense chinstrap beard framed his face and hid the soft beginning s of a second chin. His button nose was accentuated by a cute little nose-ring that eerily resembled Bull’s.<br />
<br />
He wore a tanktop that barely concealed his chubby pecs or the soft curly hairs that covered them. The pink tanktop was also a bit too short, the pale crescent of his jiggly little beerbelly peaked through. Below the tanktop was his shorts, which were tight around a perfectly formed bubblebutt. <br />
<br />
Your new body was shorter, thicker and hairier than your old body. As you stared at the old man with his arms around your shoulders, you realized you looked like a much younger version of Randolph, the resemblance strong. Then you looked at the front of your shorts and noticed a bulky bulge. <br />
<br />
With dawning horror, you realize the cockcage Bull had been wearing had also carried through to this reality, as it was perfectly outlined by the shorts.<br />
<br />
“Well, go on Braiden, say hi to Uncle Jack!” Grandpa Randy said, patting your wobbly ass.<br />
<br />
The pat jostled something you’d barely been aware of, lodged deep in your butthole. <br />
<br />
You clenched your hole and gasped. There was something big stretching you wide in there and it bumped something that made your cock twitch mutely in its cage. A wet stain appeared on the front of your shorts.<br />
<br />
“H-hi Uncle Jack,” You blushed, feeling your pucker suckling on the buttplug like a pacifier, sending jolts of bliss to your brain, “I-it’s such a p-pleasure to meet you!”<br />
<br />
Your grandfather turns you around, and in the mirror you see a stylized bear tattooed on your back.<br />
<br />
“I just got him his first tattoo for his 18th birthday last year!” Randolph said proudly. “Picked this one out himself! He’s such a wonderful cub, but he needs a daddy.”<br />
<br />
Wait, were you 19? That seemed wrong, somehow. It was so confusing. Memories of your new life were starting to trickle in. They didn’t replace your old ones, but your old life felt hazy, like a dream you just woke up from, fading quickly.<br />
<br />
“Look, Rudolph, he’s very cute, but I’m not sure if I’m the best man for him.” Jack said.<br />
<br />
“What? You’re a business owner and you’ve always been telling me how lonely you are! And look, it isn’t like you’re getting any younger. Someone needs to inherit your store. Why not Braiden?”<br />
<br />
Jack winced, “Well, you see, about my store… it’s more complex than you think.“<br />
<br />
“So teach him!” Rudolph barreled on, not taking no for an answer. “Make him your apprentice or whatever antique store owners have! You said it yourself the other day you wished you had a capable employee. Make Braiden one.”<br />
<br />
You realized this was the only way for you to go back to your own body. Fucking your own uncle was gross, but… wait, he wasn’t your uncle anymore in this reality, was he? It was kind of reliving to know that.<br />
<br />
“I would love to work with you, Sir.” You said, flashing a polite smile.<br />
<br />
For a moment, you think you consider stroking Jack’s thigh, but it was increasingly obvious that Jack would take that approach as predatory and get all defensive. You would need to take it slow, make it all romantic. Grandpa said Jack’s type always fell for the mushy stuff.<br />
<br />
“Uhhh… this is awkward.” Jack rubbed the back of his head. “Are you, uh… clean, Braiden?”<br />
<br />
Your face burned as you realize what Jack was asking.<br />
<br />
Grandpa Randy stepped forward. “He’s literally a virgin! I’ve never let anyone touch him!”<br />
<br />
“Not even you?” Jack asked with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Grandpa’s face reddened. “No! I’m not that perverted, you old dog! Look!”<br />
<br />
Your grandpa pulls your shorts down.<br />
<br />
“See?” Grandpa Randy pointed at your caged cock, “He hasn’t been able to touch himself since he asked me to train him!”<br />
<br />
You blush, the cockcage tucking your cock and balls close to your shaved groin. It had already been a year since your grandpa had locked you in it and most of the time you forgot it was even there. But now you could feel your cock straining against the metal, unsuccessfully attempting to grow erect.<br />
<br />
“Train him for what?” <br />
<br />
“To be the perfect cub!” Grandpa Rudy said, then barked, “Braiden, turn around!”<br />
<br />
You find yourself blushing harder, guessing what your grandpa wanted to show off next.<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, you turned around, bending over and spreading your furry cheeks. In between your asscheeks, the black knob of your buttplug stood out. It stretched your pucker wider than you had guessed it did. <br />
<br />
Grandpa bent over and pumped the dildo in and out of your hole. It popped out and went back in, your ring slow to resume its tight clench. You shudder and moan as it bumped your prostate.<br />
<br />
“See? Kid’s nice and loose for that fat pecker of yours, Jack.” Grandpa Randy grinned.<br />
<br />
“And you did this all for me?” Jack asked as you hastily hiked up your shorts. “Why now?”<br />
<br />
“I was saving him for your birthday, to be honest,” Grandpa Rudy shrugged, “But then the cub ran into you. He seems to have taken a liking to you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes… “ Jack eyes narrowed at you, “An interest.”<br />
<br />
“I studied theoretical physics. I’m smart.” You say.<br />
<br />
You, of course, never actually studied theoretical physics. But magic seemed to function on stoner logic and you DID smoke a lot of pot. It was a good stress reliever after being edged to orgasm for hours and never actually cumming.<br />
<br />
“Theoretical physics, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, like what you were saying about that suit.” You say, “It’s like quantum physics.”<br />
<br />
Jack studied you a little more. “I’ll take him.”<br />
<br />
“Ah!” Good man, Jack, good man!” Grandpa Rudy grinned and leaned in, “Don’t know if I could have him in my house much longer before I ended up fucking him.”<br />
<br />
“I figured.” Jack said flatly then turned to you. “Alright, cub. Come with me.”<br />
<br />
You followed after Jack as he left the gym.</p>
