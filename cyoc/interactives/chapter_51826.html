<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I guess I'll be a teenage wrestler,&quot; Andy said, &quot;Might as well be <br />
creative.&quot; The amulet on his chest glowed brightly for several <br />
seconds, then subsided.<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, across town, Mitch was reviewing his presentation for the <br />
senior executives who would be visiting that day.  All of a sudden, <br />
his body started to feel tired, and all of his joints and muscles <br />
began to ache.  He felt like he had been through the workout of the <br />
century.  He stood up from his desk, and then gripped it tightly as he <br />
almost lost his balance.  He felt exhausted.  He stumbled out of his <br />
cubicle and made his way to the bathroom down the hall.  He entered <br />
the bathroom and walked over to the sink to splash some water on his <br />
face.<br />
<br />
One of his coworkers and friends, Mark, was washing his hands at the <br />
sink to the one that Mitch was standing at.  “Are you okay, Mitch?” <br />
Mark asked as he dried his hands on some paper towels. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, just tired,” Mitch replied, as another pain swept through his <br />
body.  “I think I’m a little wound up due to the presentation later <br />
today,” he managed to get out, trying to maintain a level of calmness.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure you’ll do great,” Mark replied with a smile.  “Just don’t <br />
overwork yourself, all right?”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, man,” Mitch replied, wishing Mark would just leave him alone <br />
so that he could just collapse on the restroom floor.<br />
<br />
“Hey, it looks like you’ve been working out a lot,” Mark said as he <br />
headed out of the bathroom.  “Trying to get yourself all super <br />
muscular for Karissa, eh?  Just don’t overdo it!”<br />
<br />
Mitch didn’t reply as Mark left him alone in the bathroom.  Working <br />
out?  I haven’t worked out in the past couple of weeks…  Yet, as Mitch <br />
looked at himself in the mirror, he could tell that his body did look <br />
more toned.  His fine white dress shirt seemed tight across his chest, <br />
and even his jacket and pants looked tighter.<br />
<br />
As he looked himself over in the mirror, something odd happened.  He <br />
felt like the sleeves of his shirt were pulling up under his jacket.  <br />
He tried to take off his jacket, realizing how much tighter it had <br />
gotten as he removed it.  He finally pulled it off of his arms just in <br />
time to see the sleeves of his shirt completely disappear.  He let his <br />
jacket drop to the floor, not noticing as it disappeared into <br />
nothingness as soon as it hit the ground.<br />
<br />
Mitch was amazed to see how muscular his arms looked.  He had never <br />
been a hairy guy, but his arm hair had definitely darkened and <br />
thickened slightly, bringing a sharper definition to his muscles.  He <br />
watched in amazement as the knot on his tie completely unwound itself, <br />
and the tie slid its way from around his neck.  It began to move up to <br />
his head, and although he tried to grab it, it seemed to be controlled <br />
by a force significantly stronger than Mitch’s own strength.  The tie <br />
thickened around his ears, turning into a hard plastic, while the rest <br />
of the tie moved itself around the top of his head and the bottom of <br />
his neck, turning into rubber straps.  Mitch watched as his hair grew <br />
longer and shaggier, growing under the straps until they connected <br />
both under his neck and two straps across his head, finishing his new <br />
headgear.  As Mitch looked at himself in the mirror, he realized <br />
without a doubt that he was significantly younger, more than likely in <br />
his late teens.  That’s right, a voice said softly in his head.  I <br />
just turned 17 last month.  <br />
<br />
Wait, 17? Mitch thought.  That couldn’t be right.  But the voice in <br />
his head kept confirming more and more that he was in fact 17, and <br />
thoughts of being on local high school wrestling team filled his <br />
brain.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t able to dwell on these thoughts for long, as the <br />
transformation that had begun on his shirt continued.  Without the <br />
tie, he noticed that the neck of the shirt was lowering, pulling the <br />
fabric tighter around his shoulders.  He felt the back of his shirt <br />
and realized the same thing was happening in the back.  The collar of <br />
the shirt had completely vanished, and it looked like the shirt was <br />
becoming more of a tank top. Instead of turning into cheap ribbed <br />
cotton, however, the shirt felt smoother…Lycra, the voice in Mitch’s <br />
head told him.  The perfect fabric for a wrestling singlet.<br />
<br />
Singlet?! Mitch thought desperately.  He tried to untuck his shirt <br />
from his pants, but found much to his dismay that they seemed to have <br />
merged into one article of clothing. He watched in horror as the white <br />
lycra turned into a lime green color, with the sides under his armpits <br />
becoming a brilliant blue.  This can’t be happening, Mitch thought, <br />
but then realized that his slacks were starting to pull up on <br />
themselves.  They came higher and higher, eventually revealing his <br />
knees, stopping a quarter of the way down his hips.  He noticed that <br />
his legs were a bit hairier, matching the rest of his body.  His nice <br />
pants also turned into a lycra fabric, turning the same lime green <br />
color as his shirt had become, now completely fused together in the <br />
center.  The blue under his armpits proceeded down the length of his <br />
new singlet turning towards his crotch, thinning as it reached the <br />
bottom.  Another blue spot on the sides of his singlet on the bottom <br />
front part of it, while the same blue outlined the seams throughout <br />
the entire piece of clothing.   The singlet finished with the outline <br />
of a blue “E” appearing on the front of his singlet, and the words <br />
“East High Knights” appearing on his back.<br />
<br />
The fabric then began to tighten significantly, showing off his <br />
noticeable bulge.  He realized in all of that happened with the <br />
change, he was now completely freeballing, as his boxers had <br />
disappeared when his singlet had finished forming.  If there was any <br />
doubt, the obvious outline of his penis showed itself proudly through <br />
the tight singlet, revealing a nice bulge.  <br />
<br />
Yeah…freeballin’ is so comfortable when you’re wearing a singlet…The <br />
ever growing stronger voice whispered in his thoughts.  While he <br />
continued to marvel at this change, he felt something thicken around <br />
his knees.  He watched in surprise as Brute Quick Strike kneepads <br />
formed on both of his knees, protecting them in case anyone tried to <br />
take him down quickly on the mat.  He looked down at his expensive <br />
Italian leather shoes and his dress socks, the last things to change.  <br />
They slowly started to change color, turning from black to a deep blue <br />
to match the blue on his singlet.  He watched as the dress socks <br />
shrank down his leg a bit, to where just a bit appeared above the new <br />
high top of the shoes that had formed around his ankles. The fabric <br />
changed to a cheap cotton, barely appearing above the top of his shoe.  <br />
Three white stripes formed on both sides of each shoe, while the <br />
tongue of the shoe turned into a gray mesh and the blue laces laced <br />
themselves up around the tongue. The Adidas name and logo appeared at <br />
the top of his new Adidas Tyrint III wrestling shoes.<br />
<br />
Mitch looked himself over in the mirror.  His skin had tanned <br />
significantly.  The tight singlet revealed his rippling muscles, and <br />
his cock was strongly outlined in the front of the singlet, a damp <br />
spot appearing above the head.  His body had grown a bit hairier, not <br />
excessively so, but definitely thicker than he had been before.  His <br />
youthful face and muscular body, though, made him the hit of all the <br />
girls at school.  He was definitely king of East High.  Slowly but <br />
surely, the old Mitch disappeared, replaced by a cocky new teenager.</p>
