<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Jeff thought to himself: &quot;There sure are a bunch of options to choose from, but there&#39;s one animal I have always wanted to be...&quot;. Jeff navigates to the drop down menu on his screen and clicks on the Gorilla Transformation Package, after which another set of configurable parameters appeared: <br />
<br />
Painful / Painless Transformation<br />
Transformation Duration:<br />
Reality Shift: On / Off<br />
Body Size: Large / Average / Small<br />
Maintain Current Intelligence Levels: On / Off.<br />
<br />
 Jeff stood for a moment, processing the options he is given until he finally settles on a painful, five - transformation with reality shift disabled, a body size of large and opting to retain his human intelligence.<br />
<br />
 He then presses Begin Transformation Process on his computer. He was feeling good about finally being what he has always felt like. But at the same time he was a little anxious about it.<br />
<br />
 The timer on the screen starts ticking down.<br />
<br />
 Jeff stands there unmoving, fully clothed, waiting for something to happen, to hear his clothing to start ripping and tearing, to start buffing up with muscles, to see his skin change color. Fifteen seconds have passed and he doesn&#39;t feel anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it was a scam...&quot; He says while exhailing with a tone of disappointment.<br />
<br />
And then...<br />
He is struck with a stabbing ache on his stomach. He fell to the ground screaming in complete agony, paralyzed as he saw his shirt start lifting up from his stomach, pushed by his growing belly. He feels his internal organs shuffle around his ever growing stomach that has now gotten so big he can&#39;t see over it while lying down.<br />
<br />
His chest follows suit, his pecks growing getting fatter and at the same time more muscular. He feels as if he is drowning as his lungs start to also change size to accomodate for this drastic change. This makes him start coughing harder and harder, thinking he was about to pass out. His pecks, now towering over his comperably small head, are now proportionate to his gigantic fat stomach. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when the next big change takes place, his skin starts shifting to a darker tone until its almost completely black, wrinkled, rough and thick reminiscent of that of a silverback. He tries to touch his new bigger belly and torso, attempting to feel his new skin but his puny little hands can&#39;t reach. Not that he had any time to do so anyway, cause the skin was starting to expand over to his other body parts, something that caused Jeff extreme levels of pain.<br />
<br />
 His new darker skin first started going down towards his legs. They bones in his legs started to expand in diameter causing him to let out a loud scream in agony as his legs started getting bigger and bigger, ripping and tearring his slim fit jeans appart making them nothing more than a few pieces of fabric, to the point where one of his legs was now wider than his entire human body. But this part was not done yet and Jeff knew that. He couldn&#39;t be a sliverback gorilla without some proper fur. As his leg fur started to rapidly grown in, Jeff felt like he was being blasted with bullets or the thorns of a hedgehog because of how thick and plentiful the hairs that comprise a gorilla&#39;s mayne are. Jeff touched his two legs together and felt how thick his leg hair was, it was like a forest of dark black hairs.<br />
<br />
 The next part due to transform then was of course his feet, which as Jeff could see from the side look comically small compared to his massive legs and upper body. First, the bone structure in Jeff&#39;s feet started change to a more hand like joint configuration. He felt his toes start to lengthen and widen with new joints forming between the bones, the nails on his toes starting to get larger and thicker, covering more of his new bigger toes, which were more reminiscent of fingers at tgis point. His toes kept on legthening and getting wider and thicked as he kept screaming, totally paralyzed from the eye - watering pain he was experiencing. And then came the most painful part of the transformation of his feet; the rearrangement of his bones. What used to be his big toes started moving along the side, along with the joints that connected them to his feet, all the while cracking and stretching. His feet reconfigured themselves to look more like hands. For what felt to him like ages, they kept on shifting position going lower and lower towards the bottom of his feet until they basically became a second set of thumbs. That was when the final stage of his feet transformation started to take place, when the dark skin started moving towards his feet, they began getting larger, wider, thicker to fit better with his bigger body. They stretched, his bones becoming thicker and wider getting to the point where one of his toes now had a diameter more than two times that of his eye and one of his feet could wrap round his entire face. Not only that but his feet were now almost four and a half inches thick. Jeff flexed his new toes looking at them from the side of his body, admiring how flexible, big and strong they were.<br />
<br />
The dark skin then began expanding towards Jeff&#39;s back. His back fur was growing at an unprecedented rate causing him to tear up from all the pain. His Spinal Cord cracked as it got thicker and more masive, to support Jeff&#39;s now almost 700 pound - body. As his back thicked, he felt himslef starting to get subtly but noticeably lifted off of the floor. His shoulder plates were next in line after the spinal cord, as they started getting wider, thicked and longer, shifting more and more and simultaneusly broadening his shoulders as they moved towards the outer edge of his body. His shoulders had widened to the point that they were now in line with the width of his torso, his stomach and his legs. Jeff could see how broad his shoulders were and realized how comically small his hands and head were. At this stage in his transformation, his hands couldn&#39;t even reach up to touch his pecks and weren&#39;t long enough to even reach the halfway mark between his shoukders and his belly.<br />
<br />
But that was soon to change. His arms started to expand painfully, his bones becoming more massive and bulky as fur was starting to engulf them. They widened and thickened, becoming bigger and bigger by the second. Jeff watched in awe as his arms were becoming beastly and gorilla - like all the while unable to handle the pain of their enlarging and growing fur. They kept popping and cracking. But the worst part was yet to come. Suddenly, his hands let out a bunch of loud, bone - breaking cracks as they started getting longer at an even faster pace. They expanded rapidly, making Jeff let out a loud agony - fueled scream as they kept on lengthening. When they finally stopped getting longer, they were long enough to be able to touch Jeff&#39;s thighs and as wide and thick as his legs. Jeff was truly amazed and impressed by their length, but know it wouldn&#39;t be long before the next phase of his arm transformation would commence. His fingers started cracking and making horrifying sounds as their bones started to thicken and widen. The joints connecting his fingers to his hands also widened and palms were also heading down the same path, thickening and widening. His fingers and lalm became just as wide and thick as his feet if not bigger and more massive. His hand was now also able to wrao aound his entire head. And then came the most painful stage of his hand transformation. His palms started to stretch and lengthen separating his index, middle, ring and pinky fingers from his thumbs, to the point wgere even his now huge thumbs were barely able to reach the tip of his other fingers. And with that, his hands were now even bigger and more massive, long and wide enough to cover almost two of Jeff&#39;s heads stacked on top of each other. There was one last step however to this stage; the growing of fur at the top of his palm. The hairs that reached up to his wrist and covered the entire perimeter of his arms started expanding into his palms, a process that to Jeff&#39;s surprise was more painful than he expected. The fur reached up to his knuckles and completely covered the entire area of his palm.<br />
<br />
The last and most dreaded part for Jeff of the transformation was now due. Jeff felt his neck lengthen, moving his head away from his body by a small margin. His neck then began growing and thickening as fur grew over it and it became much more fitting for the massive size his body possesed now. It was now a bit wider than his head, but that wouldn&#39;t be for very long. Jeff felt the hair on his body start to fall in large tufs, leaving his scalp hairless for the time being. It wasn&#39;t long though until it got covered with dark fur as it started climbing up from his back, meging with that of his neck and starting to reach up to his puny head, covering its side and top with his dark mayne. But it was far from over, and Jeff knew that. It was then that he felt his skull start to crack and pop as it began expanding outward, getting bigger in all dimensions, all the while Jeff&#39;s eyes were closed as he was trying and failing to contain the pain he was feeling, letting out scream after scream. His head was now as thick thick as the rest of his body and Jeff could now look over his stomach, direclty at his legs. The transformation then resumed as he felt his ears starting to enter deeper into his head, the outer oart of his ear melting into it, and the spot where it once stood now getting covered with the same black fur. He felt his forehead starting to puch a little more into his skull like a real gorilla&#39;s, creating a pointy top to his head. His nose bridge started cracking as it started bending towards the top of his head until the obly thing left were two small holes in his head, which then along with his mouth started protruding from his head, forming a small but noticeable muzzle resembling that of an ape&#39;s. The two nostrills&#39; diameter started expanding until they covered a good chunck of his face while at the same time, his teeth were falling out as he was spitting them and new fang - line ones were coming out of his gums.<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to speak, and to his surprise he was able to if nothing else with a drastically different voice. His voice was now deep, rumbly, more beast - like than any other human being&#39;s. It was so deep he could feel it vibrating his skull and body as he was speaking random words to see how they sound.<br />
<br />
Jeff was now a complete Gorilla, everything he had wanted to be from the beggining. He was hairy, ten feet tall, barely able to fit in his room and with a deep voice.<br />
<br />
Except for one thing that hadn&#39;t quite been completely transformaed anymore; his manhood.<br />
<br />
As he stood up he noticed that it hadn&#39;t changed drastically but that it was different. It had grwon a little, but Jeff could still feel that the transformation wasn&#39;t complete and that this was the last stage. <br />
<br />
And he was right.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a rush hit Jeff in the head. He felt an unbelievable urge to start stroking his cock. He wrapped his large, beastly fingers around it covering it completely. As he kept on stroking, he felt blood rush to it. Under his hands, he felt it growing by more than an inch every second. At some point, it started pushing out of his massively thick fingers and kept on growing still. When it stopped it had reached twenty inches in length and four inches in diameter. He kept stroking it, masturbsting, as he was sputing out cum load after cum load. His fur was covered with it and just as a test Jeff even stroke it with his new giagntic feet, which gave hik even more pleasure.<br />
<br />
He was covered in his cum and was huting constantly, scratching his armpits and his ass, eating bananas with both his hands and dirty feet and throwing the peels on the floor like the animal that he had always felt he was.<br />
<br />
The next week he was transported by animal services to the jungle, where he lived as his true self, a bulky, beastly, dirty and nasty gorilla for the rest of his life, constantly masturbating and living happily ever after.</p>
