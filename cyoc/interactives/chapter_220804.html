<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Chesterton stared at the mess of papers before him. It had been three weeks since his encounter with Ms. Kagawa and he was almost at his wit&#39;s end. He was cooped up in an abandoned apartment complex 15 minutes outside of the city limits. He had been spending the better part of two days pouring through every old religious text he could get his hands on. Most were pointless since they were directly referring to him. He had no possible idea who Ms. Kagawa could have been referring to, but Chesterton had learned to spot liars with pinpoint accuracy and he did not see any reason to believe she was lying.<br />
<br />
Short of finding out what exactly he was dealing with, Chesterton figured his best option was to impede Ms. Kagawa&#39;s daughter, Akari. The mother was right; Akari needed to be severed from Preitha. The two had been inseparable since the failed attack, to the point where Preitha was coming into the pawn shop every single day Akari worked. He was repulsed by their obnoxious public displays of affection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horny little rabbits&quot; he thought to himself. Suddenly, something dawned on him. He didn&#39;t need to separate Akari and Preitha; quite the opposite. He needed to keep them preoccupied, and he had just the thing. <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Preitha and Akari woke up in Preitha&#39;s bed. The two had alternated sleeping in each other&#39;s apartments since the incident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning sleepyhead&quot; Akari said gleefully as she pushed Preitha&#39;s hair out of her face.<br />
&quot;Ugh, good morning &#39;Kari&quot; Preitha said groggily. <br />
<br />
The two gave each other a kiss and got out of bed. Preitha quickly got undressed and ran into the shower. Akari preferred to shower at night. Out of morbid curiosity, Akari opened up Preitha&#39;s closet. &quot;Huh&quot; she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Preitha came out wearing her bathrobe. &quot;What you looking at &#39;Kari?&quot;<br />
&quot;You really don&#39;t wear anything but skirts and dresses, huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;My mother always taught me that the best way for an Indian girl to make her presence known was to dress as femininely as possible.&quot; Preitha replied. &quot;I resent her for it, but she imprinted on me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Preitha, I didn&#39;t mean anything by it.&quot; Akari said. &quot;My father always told me to dress in a way where no one would think I was a whore. It fucked me up too.&quot;<br />
Preitha walked over to Akari and gently grabbed her face. &quot;I would love you if you wore nothing but potato sacks everyday.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe we should show up to the punk club in potato sacks&quot; Akari said. &quot;They might let us in&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe they kicked us out!&quot; Preitha replied, annoyed. &quot;Those IDs worked at like three different bars.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fully dressed, the two headed to Akari&#39;s car and drove off.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The two pulled into the parking lot of the pawn shop. &quot;It&#39;s weird that there&#39;s only ever like two cars in this parking lot.&quot; Preitha said. &quot;You&#39;d think that this guy would get more business with what he offers.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Akari and Preitha walked into the shop, they saw Mr. Chesterton with an uncharacteristically large grin on his face.<br />
&quot;...hey Mr. Chesterton&quot; Preitha said sheepishly. As she turned to walk out the door, Mr. Chesterton asked her to stop.<br />
&quot;Let me ask you two something...I have a friend at Hawkspite, the local punk bar. They told me that three nights ago, two underage girls, one Asian and one Indian, were thrown out for having fake IDs.<br />
&quot;I am so sorry, it&#39;ll never happen again.&quot; Akari replied desperately.<br />
<br />
Mr. Chesterton held his hand up. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not in trouble, and frankly it&#39;s not something I particularly care about.&quot; Mr. Chesterton said. &quot;However...I may have a workaround for you two.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Preitha asked, curious.<br />
&quot;What if I were to offer you something that would make you older? You would never have to worry about getting thrown out of another bar again. <br />
&quot;....you could do that?&quot; Preitha asked, very keenly interested.<br />
&quot;Wait, wait, wait&quot; Akari stopped her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Chesterton but I&#39;m not ready to be middle aged or anything,&quot;<br />
<br />
Chesterton let out a belly laugh. &quot;No, no, no. This would only age each of you three years, so you&#39;d both be 21 or so. Older, but still young enough to do whatever your heart desired. The physical and mental effects would be minimal, and the world would recognize you as 21.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akari and Preitha huddled up closely. <br />
&quot;Do you want to do this?&quot; Akari asked. &quot;This sounds pretty permanent.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do we have to lose?&quot; Preitha replied. &quot;We gain total control of our lives and maybe have a little more fun in the process.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Akari said with a smile. &quot;I would still have plenty of time for the art academy and you could still do fashion school.&quot;<br />
<br />
They turned to face Chesterton. &quot;We accept,&quot; Akari said &quot;....but what is the cost?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Chesteron said. &quot;Consider it an employee perk. Speaking of which, Preitha, if you&#39;re ever interested, I&#39;d like to offer you a position here. I think you&#39;d do good work here and I can tell you the pay is considerably higher than wherever you&#39;re working now.&quot;<br />
Preitha stood there, somewhat shocked. &quot;Give me the weekend, Mr. Chesterton. I&#39;ll let you know Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Chesterton nodded. &quot;Now, to activate the potions, you two must simply drink the potions together, read the incantations from this scroll I&#39;ve attached and perform a physical act of affection, like a kiss. Quite simple.&quot;  He reached into his pockets and pulled out two large purple vials, handing one each to Akari and Preitha. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll do this tonight at your place.&quot; Preitha said<br />
&quot;Cannot wait&quot; Akari replied as she gave Preitha a quick kiss. &quot;See you tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Akari drove home nervously from work. This...thing Chesterton had offered seemed too good to be true. She knew he was powerful, she had seen it up close multiple times, but still, what if this went wrong? What if her or Preitha got hurt? What if it did work and it changed both of them to the point where they wouldn&#39;t be together anymore?&quot; <br />
<br />
As Akari pulled up to her apartment, she saw Preitha standing out front wearing a bright blue summer dress and all her negative thoughts dissipated. She got out of her car and immediately ran to hug her. &quot;You ready for this?&quot; Akari asked. &quot;Absolutely.&quot; Preitha replied.<br />
<br />
They walked inside. Preitha had set up Akari&#39;s kitchen table with candles and plates. She was holding her purple vial. &quot;I figure we could celebrate with a nice dinner after we do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Preitha sat down on Akari&#39;s couch. Akari plopped down right next to her. Reaching into her jean pockets, she pulled out her purple vial. &quot;Oh wait, I don&#39;t have the scroll.&quot; Preitha said. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got it.&quot; Akari said as she pulled out out a scraggly piece of paper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s do this,&quot; Akari said. Nervously, she pulled the cork off of her bottle and downed the whole thing. &quot;Blegh,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;Damn, no hesitation, huh.&quot; Preitha said. &quot;Well, no turning back now.&quot; Preitha removed the cork from her bottle and chugged it. &quot;Ugh, oh god, that tastes like Pepto Bismol that sat out in the sun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akari, with her hands shaking, began to read the inscription on the scroll. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quod spiritus maturitatem perducenda est, caro pie, et libidine insatiabilis&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that even mean?&quot; Preitha asked nervously.<br />
&quot;Absolutely no idea.&quot; Akari replied.<br />
<br />
The two stared into each other&#39;s eyes for a few moments. &quot;See you at 21, &#39;Kari&quot; Preitha beamed. &quot;See you there, Preitha&quot; Akari replied as the two locked into a deep kiss<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Within moments of kissing, something began to feel off for the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;...is it just me or did it get warmer in here?&quot; Akari asked.<br />
&quot;No...no...it&#39;s definitely gotten warmer in here.&quot; Preitha said, as she started to sweat. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go grab some water.&quot; As Akari stood to get up, she immediately bent over in pain.<br />
&quot;PREITHA! Are you all right?&quot; Akari yelled. She rose to get up and made it to Preitha&#39;s spot before collapsing to the ground herself.<br />
&quot;Oh god, did your boss poison us?&quot; Preitha asked, wincing.<br />
&quot;No, no way-AAAGHH&quot; Akari yelped as her body began to spasm.<br />
<br />
The two girls began moaning in pain as their bodies began to grumble. Akari and Preitha could only stare at each other, helpless as their bodies began to vibrate intensely. For a few moments, neither could see anything as their flesh continued to vibrate and almost liquify. Preitha and Akari stewed in their gelatinous state for what seemed like an hour before the rumbling stopped and their flesh returned to normal. Feeling slightly disoriented, the two managed to get up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was it?&quot; Akari asked.<br />
&quot;I guess so, that was&quot; Preitha attempted to say, but was stopped in her tracks as her formerly narrow hips violently jutted outward at that moment. &quot;Oh fuck.&quot; she said. Preitha tried to maintain her balance but couldn&#39;t as her ass rumbled and expanded rapidly, tearing the back of her summer dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Preitha&quot; Akari said,  She looked at her own thin arms for a moment and was shocked as they added pounds of weight, making her arms double their previous size. The same process followed with her legs as her jeans began to tighten rapidly. The fabric on the siding began to tear apart as Akari&#39;s hips extended outward. Her stomach began to push on the jeans, popping the top button.<br />
<br />
Preitha tried desperately to keep her blue dress on, it being unable to compensate for all the new weight Preitha was putting on. &quot;My arms are so fucking big&quot; Preitha wept, as her waist began to extend out and forward. Finally, with a last rumble and push forward, Preitha&#39;s dress ripped completely. Her panties were beginning to follow suit, and Preitha looked down to see her bra holding on for dear life, as her breasts began to take on mass.<br />
<br />
Akari, crying, desperately tried to keep her posture as her jeans completely tore. Her bra snapped as her breasts kept expanding. &quot;No, please no&quot; she said to herself as tried to hold her white shirt on to herself. It didn&#39;t work as in a matter of seconds, her upper torso had put on additional weight, leaving Akari to just desperately cover her chest with her hand.<br />
<br />
In a daze, neither of them noticed the changes to their face. Akari and Preitha&#39;s lips grew somewhat and their cheeks began to fill out with new weight. With Akari and Preitha desperately wishing for the process to be over, they simultaneously felt their nether regions get intense with feeling. They both let out loud moans, with their voices each deepening ever so slightly. <br />
<br />
Once it was done, they each laid on the floor for a while. <br />
<br />
&quot;AKARI, GET UP!&quot; Preitha said as she gathered to her feet.<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Akari replied. She managed to get to her feet but still felt herself shaky.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s take a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akari and Preitha both walked into the bathroom, turned the lights, and looked in the mirror. &quot;My goodness&quot; Preitha exclaimed. Preitha and Akari had started out the day at 107 and 99 pounds respectively. Both had gained at least thirty pounds. Akari and Preitha both possessed DD breasts, far cries from their former A cups. Preitha looked down at her hips and couldn&#39;t believe they were hers. Akari  tried shaking her ass, giggling at how it moved. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think...I think...we look good&quot; Akari said.<br />
&quot;...yeah, we really do.&quot; Preitha said happily. &quot;We were twigs before.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I have hips now.&quot; Akari said to herself. <br />
&quot;...how old are we exactly?&quot; Preitha said in a mix of worry and curiosity.<br />
<br />
Akari ran to the coffee table and picked up her wallet. &quot;It says I&#39;m 21. I&#39;m presuming it&#39;s the same for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey &#39;Kari?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Preitha walked up to her and gave her a surprise kiss. &quot;Why don&#39;t we put these new hips of ours to work?&quot; Preitha said. Akari smiled as she pushed Preitha onto her couch. Akari started gyrating intensely on Preitha&#39;s legs. She put her fingers in Preitha&#39;s mouth and let her bite. &quot;Oh my god.&quot; Preitha yelled, feeling herself get sweaty again. She stuck her hand in her vagina and started rubbing vigorously. Akari continued riding Preitha&#39;s leg, moaning louder and louder. &quot;Oh, oh, oh, OOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH&quot; as Akari climaxed, with cum getting all over Preitha&#39;s torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...was amazing.&quot; Preitha said. &quot;Kari, your new body is amazing.&quot;<br />
Akari gently laid her hand on Preitha&#39;s face. &quot;I didn&#39;t think you could get more stunning, but you have.&quot; Akari told her.<br />
Preitha kissed her on the cheek. &quot;We&#39;re two curvy bitches ready to take on anything.&quot;<br />
Akari smiled for a moment only to realize something. &quot;We&#39;re gonna need to go shopping tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;None of our clothing fits us anymore.&quot;<br />
The two burst out into hysterical laughter.</p>
