<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meeting Hunni Bunni was one thing, and Jessica knew that. She also recognized the problems that came with it in that like Shyra, Hunni Bunni seemed to have Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder, but because of the cancers that Hunni Bunni had had as a result of being born in Chernobyl before that plant melted down and managed to get out after it melted down created other issues. Hunni Bunni had survived the cancers and her conversion into a Rabbit Animalian helped cure off those cancers, which Jessica took as a good thing. However, in the process, it also meant that much of the damage that the cancer had done wasn&#39;t automatically fixed. Conversion had cured the cancer, but Hunni Bunni would still have a lot to learn to essentially recover from the damage done, and that was the thing that Jessica knew would be one of the big problems going forward, particularly if her family was to take on an adoptive role for Hunni Bunni.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to meet mommy Bunni and daddy Bunni?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked to Jessica and Shyra, who&#39;d gotten off shift attempt to ease the introductions to Jessica&#39;s parents. The Horizon Agent also followed along as well, though he was at the rear of the procession for the moment to make sure that Hunni Bunni didn&#39;t wander off.<br />
<br />
&quot;My family name is Mariana,&quot; Jessica corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bunni sounds cuter,&quot; Hunni Bunni said with a confident tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if that is the name you want for yourself, that&#39;s fine,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;but my folks probably won&#39;t change their name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re also not going to be the sort that will just openly talk about sex or their sex-lives,&quot; Shyra added, remembering back on her first meeting with Jessica and her father. It wasn&#39;t necessarily a horrendous meeting, but it was something where she had to admit that she&#39;d let her own case of Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder get the better of her. It was still there, and in a way, Shyra took a great deal of personal pride in being able to teach Jessica the art of seduction, when she could, but she had to admit that a lot of it was only possible due to counseling with Doctor Jones and supervised visits with the Mariana family to make sure that things were kept &quot;clean&quot; while interacting. Though a part of her also figured that if the Mariana family ended up &quot;adopting&quot; Hunni Bunni... some things would be hard to control.<br />
<br />
And looking over her shoulder, Shyra couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit intimidated by Hunni Bunni. Sure, Hunni Bunni&#39;s personality was a bit &quot;innocent&quot; in some respects, but her size was a totally different issue. Despite the fact that like Jessica, Hunni Bunni had gotten her dose of the Rabbit Strain of the Animalia Virus from Judy, a Mountain Cottontail, Hunni Bunni practically dwarfed all the other uplifted Mountain Cottontail Rabbits, and in Jessica&#39;s case converted Mountain Cottontails too. The only Rabbit Animalian that was bigger than Hunni Bunni was Rockwall and he was based of a breed of domestic rabbit that was bred to be unusually large for a rabbit, thus Hunni Bunni&#39;s size made little real sense. And with that size would mean difficulty in handling her, especially if Hunni Bunni put her mind to something that wasn&#39;t wanted. That gave Shyra enough reason to wonder why Horizon really wanted the Mariana family to focus on adopting and looking after Hunni Bunni. But that appeared to be the plan, and if Jessica was willing to help with it... Shyra was willing to offer some support to help sell it. For Shyra also knew that her own past with regard to the Mariana family could prove that they could perhaps help Hunni Bunni.<br />
<br />
Thus they made their way out from the Meat Market and into the more residential areas of Lyre. It was a standard walk and one that before she got her car, Jessica was very familiar with. And if it weren&#39;t for what she had been told about Hunni Bunni&#39;s size... she would have driven her Bug and enjoyed being able to drive. For the moment things were relatively calm, though for many in Lyre and Animalia the rise in cases was something that was leading to some sense of worry. Jessica even got that sense when Sophie and Roland sent their recorded interview with Molly from Skull Island as proof of that. And with cases rising and the government pushing &quot;reopen at all costs&quot; regardless of the issue, that was enough to make Jessica worry. Thankfully her parents were still healthy and Hunni Bunni seemed healthy. All that remained was the introduction, though Jessica still had butterflies in her stomach as they came up to the Mariana home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Dad!&quot; Jessica called as she opened the door, &quot;I&#39;m back... Shyra and a Horizon agent have come along... to talk with you about Hunni Bunni...&quot;<br />
<br />
This was largely part of the plan that Jessica had worked out. She had told her parents about Hunni Bunni&#39;s predicament in adapting to being an Animalian and the consequences of the cancers she&#39;d had, but she did NOT tell them that she would be meeting Hunni Bunni at the Meat Market. Her parents didn&#39;t necessarily have a problem with people going there if they wanted to and they could accept that some Animalians were more than happy to present themselves in such ways, but that didn&#39;t mean they personally liked it or wanted Jessica to get involved in it. And to a great degree, Jessica didn&#39;t want to get involved in that either. Acting could be fun, but she didn&#39;t want to tie herself to a career that would relate to sex or nudity. That was primarily why she didn&#39;t mention where she was meeting Hunni Bunni at. From there the plan was that she would bring at least Hunni Bunni back to meet her parents, which she was doing.<br />
<br />
She entered through the front door to find them seated in a pair of chairs that were in front of the windows and presently protected by the afternoon sun by drawn cloth shades. Her father and mother looked up to her as she entered and held the door open, though their eyes soon visibly bulged in surprise when Hunni Bunni entered with her ears perked and casually sniffing about the room. That had to have been because of Hunni Bunni&#39;s size, though, Jessica had no real clue as to how the other rabbit woman was as big as she was. One of the first things that popped into Jessica&#39;s mind was a sort of &quot;Godzilla&quot; reference in that the radiation made her &quot;bigger,&quot; but then that wasn&#39;t likely. But there still left the questions as to how Hunni Bunni got as big as she was, and Hunni Bunni soon denied her parents the ability to ask any question on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I smell... others... four... no three dogs and a wolf, two horses, something bird-like, and something... something different,&quot; Hunni Bunni stated, &quot;Do you have other guests? Am I intruding? Would they want to have fun? I smell a boy bunny&#39;s scent too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The boy bunny is my bond-mate, Roger,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;the other scents are likely lingering scents from when Animalia Ambassadoria&#39;s had production meetings here at our house. Thus you&#39;re getting Sarah, Malice, and Travis&#39;... two Siberian Huskies and one Dalmatian... Simon... a Gray Wolf... Abby and Samson... American Quarter Horses... JC and Pauline... Microraptor Dinotopians and both are uplifted Gray Parrots... and Sophie and Roland... who are Pterodactyl Dinotopians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinosaurs?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked, still distracted by the scent traces she had picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pterosaurs,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;Sophie says that Dinosaurs and Pterosaurs are &quot;related&quot; but were still distinctly different groups of animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they here?&quot; Hunni Bunni then asked as she looked around the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so,&quot; Jessica spoke as she gently prodded at Hunni Bunni&#39;s bicep to get the larger Rabbit Animalian to move around the couch and sit down while Shyra and the Horizon Agent moved to sit down on a pair of chairs that were on the opposite wall from her parents. Hunni Bunni did calmly move and sit down while Jessica then moved to sit down beside her. As she sat down she then returned to the introductions, &quot;Mom, Dad, this is Hunni Bunni.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s huge,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother said with some surprise clear in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; the Horizon agent spoke, &quot;We have no real idea what triggered this growth... it could be that there was something in her genetic family tree that when it came in contact with the Animalia Virus it supersized her in a way that would not be proportional to the Animalian that converted her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who was that, if I may ask?&quot; her father wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judy, the same Rabbit Animalian that gave me my dose of the Animalia Virus,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;and from what Hunni Bunni&#39;s told me in the same way that Judy converted me. She gave Hunni Bunni glasses of milk to drink... and this was the result.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Made me feel better,&quot; Hunni Bunni added happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;But like with some of those converted that had had lobotomies in the past... &quot;Hunni Bunni,&quot; here has had some cognitive damage that the cancers have done to her. Conversion cured her of the cancers but could not restore the damage done,&quot; the Horizon agent added, &quot;thus why we reached out to your daughter Jessica in the hopes that your family could help her... Just like you and Jessica helped Shyra, here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that was all Regressive Hypersexuality,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father spoke, &quot;and Doctor Jones probably did more than we did...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Shyra said slowly, &quot;but Hunni Bunni may have the same problem... and Doctor Jones may be needed as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But a lot of that may also be related to what has happened with those that had lobotomies in the past,&quot; the Horizon agent added, &quot;Hunni Bunni may actually be running more on a rabbit&#39;s natural instincts than a normal Animalian, like your daughter, would. Thus things like libido, fear of predators, and things like that could drive her more than what those with Regressive Hypersexuality deal with. There may be things that are similar... and I&#39;m not going to say this will be easy for you or for Jessica and her bond-mate. But we think that given what Jessica has reported on Animalia Ambassadoria in terms of their coverage of things like Regressive Hypersexuality and the fact that she is a Rabbit Animalian... that you can help Hunni Bunni.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother commented, &quot;but wouldn&#39;t the Wesleys be better... Sarah&#39;s mother has Russian ancestry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Ukrainian,&quot; Hunni Bunni answered, &quot;Different from Russian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chernobyl is in the Ukraine,&quot; Jessica agreed with the correction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother answered, &quot;you will accept if we make some mistakes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With Ukraine... Hunni Bunni doesn&#39;t mind,&quot; Hunni Bunni answered, &quot;would mind if with Hunni Bunni, things that are cute, or bunnies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I think we can work with that,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you not bunnies like Jessica?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t want to convert,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we like our species the way it is,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother answered, &quot;and that isn&#39;t to say we disapprove of Jessica becoming an Animalian or being with a Rabbit Animalian... shoot, we don&#39;t even mind that Roger is an uplifted Rabbit Animalian. He&#39;s been smart and polite and has made our baby girl happy. That&#39;s what matters... but that&#39;s still separate from our comfort with being Human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have no problem with that, either,&quot; Jessica added placing one hand on Hunni Bunni&#39;s forearm, &quot;that&#39;s all part of being a family. We love each other regardless of our differences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you would love Hunni Bunni?&quot; Hunni Bunni asked.<br />
<br />
There was some unease at Hunni Bunni&#39;s referring to herself in the third person but Jessica and her parents did nod in agreement at this. This lead to an enthusiastic &quot;yay&quot; and Jessica being pulled into a strong bear hug that practically had Jessica gasping for air.</p>
