<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harvey headed back inside his dorm and made way to his bed. He was very exhausted from all the recent event occurring in his life. Luckily he could catch a quick break inside his dorm where he was safe from touching any fabric capable of inducing changes on him.<br />
<br />
At least that’s what he thought until he heard Harri walking quietly behind him. “What are you doin-?” Harvey called out before he felt Harri’s hands quickly drape something over his patka.<br />
<br />
Instantaneously, Harvey felt the feeling he had come to dread as the cloth wrapped around his head and became a turban. Harvey knew what was going to happen to him, he was going to transform into a Sikh again, however he had no idea how considering he couldn’t see the fabric Harri had placed on him. In fact even if he had seen the fabric, Harvey’s realized that his transformations were always completely unpredictable.<br />
<br />
Harvey saw his skin tone turning into a light shade not extremely dark but enough to distinguish himself from being considered White. Almost similar to the hue he had when he had become a fashion guru.<br />
<br />
The rest of the changes were similar to the ones he had always experienced so Harvey knew what was happening to him even without a mirror. His hair darkened to a dark shade of black along with any body hair he currently had. His beard followed as it grew to cover his entire face and below his neck as both his beard and mustache thickened but it was relatively short compared to his prior transformations. However his beard appeared to be well trimmed and groomed completely contradictory to what he had in his previous transformation.<br />
<br />
Harvey’s face continued with the usual transformations as he obtained thick lips, dark brown eyes, and a similar facial structure with more prominent nose and cheekbones. However what transpired thereafter where the new changes that were always the result of the influence of the fabric Harvey had donned. <br />
<br />
First was Harvey’s body as he began to grow to a respectable height of 6’ 3” along with his limbs proportionally stretching to match his new height. Harvey stood straight as his body began to widen, not from fat but from muscle. Harvey’s biceps widened and expanded as well as his legs which have thickened from his recent muscular development. Harvey’s muscles continued to grow as he gained two nice developed pecs on his chest followed by a defined six pack. Now Harvey had gained the form of the warrior he had previously desired but it seemed to be pointless now.<br />
<br />
Thick longs hairs appeared as they slowly covered Harvey’s beefy body beginning at his chest and forearms before moving on to his legs. A huge bush of dark black pubes also developed as they covered Harvey’s new thicker and darker dick with larger harrier balls to match. A comfortable pair of large boxer briefs developed to cover his larger equipment.<br />
 <br />
Finally followed his clothing as Harvey’s shirt changed into a plain black muscle shirt that showed his defined arms along with exposing his much more prominent armpit hair. His shorts also changed into a matching pair of black athletic shorts however they were much shorter than what Harvey was comfortable with but their elastic material helped show off Harvey’s nice bubble butt that protruded from his backside.<br />
<br />
A gold chain necklace appeared over Harvey’s neck along with a few bracelets covering both his wrists. Some donned the rainbow pride colors while other appeared to have something written on them. A waterproof smart watch was also on his left wrist which appeared to have a timer counting down . Lastly Harvey’s shoes changed into a worn out pair of Size 14 athletic shoes for his larger feet covered in Low Cut socks.<br />
<br />
Harvey’s body soon began to develop sweat as his hair dampened and beads of sweat appeared on his body and an aroma of BO emitted from his body but mostly from his exposed armpits.<br />
<br />
“You startled me!” Harpinder said in a slightly accented deep voice, “I didn’t expect my boyfriend to be here before I got back from working out.”<br />
<br />
Now that Harri was aware of Harvey’s changes he could definitely tell the man standing in front of him was not Harvey. In fact he even remembered Harvey’s name regardless of the strange notion to call the man “Harpinder.” Besides the fact he was calling him his “boyfriend” now was the most noteworthy.<br />
<br />
“Wait boyfriend? Aren’t you just my roommate?” Harry asked.<br />
<br />
“Don’t joke babe. Obviously we signed up to be roommates since we’ve been dating for a few months.” Harpinder responded in a amused tone.<br />
<br />
Harpinder then took a look in the dorm’s mirror to see if his pride flag turban was still in place. It was bit more difficult to wear while working out but Harpinder had always made sure it was tight enough to withstand his exercise routine.<br />
<br />
“Honestly I was a bit worried how other would respond to my new turban, but nobody said anything. I guess I was worried for nothing,” Harpinder said. “Sorry for not wearing your gift earlier.”<br />
<br />
“G-gift?” Harri stammered.<br />
<br />
“Yeah don’t you remember? You got it for me since I’ve been feeling so stressed these past few days. It really cheered me up today.” Harpinder said as he stopped the timer on his watch from his jog. Harpinder walked over to Harri and put a muscular arm over Harri’s neck. “But I have a feeling we can do something together that can make us both feel a lot better.”</p>
