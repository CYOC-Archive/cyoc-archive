<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing his dad shamelessly treat his pants like a toilet, Tyronius felt a twinge of jealousy as a powerful urge to do the same suddenly overcame him. Without even giving it a second thought the hatchling automatically began focusing his power in mind, it coming easier to him thanks to the strong desire fueling him. His thoughts quickly became reality as his bowels suddenly became full which he then proceeded to empty with a push of his lower muscles. Thankfully he was still being held up and dangling from his mother&#39;s outstretched arms so neither limb was intruding on the back of his padding as he began to fill it. Grunting softly Tyronius shut his eyes as he concentrated solely on pooping his diaper, tucking in his legs and his tail hiking up just like his dad, all actions that alerted his parents to what their son was doing. A thick log escaped his tail hole immediately colliding with the seat and squishing into a large mound. By the time he was finished his diaper was sporting a distinct bulge similar in size and shape to his father&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes Tyronius gave a smile both of relief and happiness at successfully soiling himself. However that look quickly faded when be realized what he just did and the feeling of embarrassment filled him. Looking at the faces of his mother and father he could they were shocked, both their mouths slightly open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyronius?...Did you poop yourself just now?&quot; Nazara asked in disbelief, her words making her hatchling tremble.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my boy!&quot; Anacal congratulated after recovering from his shock, his expression changing to one of pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear please&quot; she shushed her husband. Sensing her son was scared she pulled him in close. &quot;Tyronius is everything alright? I felt you use your power just now and I&#39;m guessing you caused your own accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know&quot; he whimpered in fear. &quot;I saw dad do it...and I wanted to do it to.&quot; On the verge of tears Tyronius resorted to sucking his thumb, the action comforting the toddler. The dragoness was about to do the same when her husband called out to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey I think I know what&#39;s wrong. Could you please set Tyronius down in the crib with me?&quot; Anacal asked.<br />
<br />
Doing as she was told Nazara set the baby hatchling inside the barred enclosure, Tyronius managing to stand despite his emotional state. Once he was inside Anacal toddled over to his regressed son and embraced him in a comforting hug. &quot;It&#39;s okay, there&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. What you did was perfectly natural for our kind&quot; he reassured.<br />
<br />
Confused a sniffling Tyronius mumbled around his thumb. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Being dragons we have instinctual urges that drive us to indulge in our inner most desires,  particularly the ones that bring us the most joy and happiness. In ancient times we were primarily drawn to greed and lust, thus we hoarded treasure and mated constantly. However in the eons since our desires have evolved and expanded to a variety of things. Me for example my inner desire is to be young and diapered, same as you. And your mother here is particular fond of sex&quot; Anacal smirked while Nazara blushed.<br />
<br />
Calming down enough to remove his thumb Tyronius asked. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t explain why it felt like I had no control. I just went ahead and did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just getting to that. I assume, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that you&#39;ve been keeping your adult hatchling side a secret and never indulged in it until now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I never really had a chance to explore it beyond fantasy&quot; he answered.<br />
<br />
Anacal nodded. &quot;Thought so. That coupled with your form being sealed away led to a very unfortunate combination. You see my son it&#39;s bad for us to repress our natural desires, whatever they may be. Doing so for a long period of time will increase the strength of urges and make them uncontrollable. From the moment your mother gave you your natural body back they must have been slowly reawakening and seeing me go number two triggered a strong one&quot; Anacal explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m going to be stuck with these uncontrollable urges?&quot; Tyronius cried out in worry, pulling away from the other hatchling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not forever. If you just embrace your babyish desires and not try to fight them as they come to you then they&#39;ll decrease in strength and become controllable again. You already used your diaper and are more than comfortable sucking your thumb. Keeping doing stuff like that and in about a week you should be back to normal&quot; Anacal said with confidence.<br />
<br />
Tyronius looked uncertain and Anacal flashed an understanding smile, gently placing a claw on the other&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this must difficult for you, having spent so much time in a world where it&#39;s against the norm to want such things. But I want you to try to learn to let go of such stigmas. Here in this world you will not be judged for your actions, and your mother and I will love and accept you no matter what&quot; Anacal promised and Tyronius felt his heart warmed by his father&#39;s words as the unconditional love of his parents was something he always craved.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try my best to embrace being a baby, and thank you that means a lot to me&quot; Tyronius smiled and overcome with emotion ran foward and hugged the black scaled hatchling tightly. Though caught off guard by the show of affection Anacal eagerly returned it. Meanwhile Nazara smiled at the tender display between the two regressed dragon gods, happy to see such a loving reunion between father and son.<br />
<br />
As Tyronius was hugging his baby dad he noticed that he was a bit taller than the other toddler. He wondered if this difference in height meant he was older than his own father even when regressed back to a diaper wearing age. Surprising, but not as surprising as finding out the all powerful god of dragons chose to be a hatchling, a fact he was still coming to terms with. Tyronius was pulled from his thoughts by a pungent scent reaching his nostrils, the source of which was his dad&#39;s padded rear. Realizing the odor guards in their diapers had started to fail, knowing his own probably smelled too given they pooped at almost roughly the same time, he took a step back from his father while wrinkling his snout. The rancid scent hitting him too Anacal quickly understood his son putting distance between them while blushing awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like I got two stinky babies on my claws&quot; the dragoness announced with s chuckled once the aroma of dirty diapers reached her. &quot;I guess the only question now is which one of you wants to a change?&quot; Nazara grinned.</p>
