<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That same uncomfortable feeling in your gut washed over you, it was working! The relief you felt from that fear vanishing was short lived as the vacuum was replaced with countless other thoughts instantly. What if you are still made of stuffing? What if you crapped yourself while a stuffed animal? As a bear you weren&#39;t hungry or thirsty but you were thinking, that takes calories, so something was being metabolized somehow, right? Oh My God You&#39;re Naked under this costume and Jillian is a female! What if you start turning back into a toy before you can get away from her and change! How focused and detailed do you have to be about your appearance? If you think of Chris Hemsworth will you become Thor? Would that lower your life expectancy? Thor&#39;s wearing a muscle suit, but bodybuilders get to that size, bigger even. Oh no, wait, if I don&#39;t think of my junk will I lose it? Think penis and balls! <br />
<br />
&quot;John take off the helmet before the suit recovers!&quot; Jillian cried.<br />
&quot;Ahh,&quot; you cried, &quot;Oh my god, Thank You!&quot; Which came out a muffled mess as you pulled off the bear head. giving her a winning smile.<br />
<br />
Jillian giggled at the mess you were, &quot;You&#39;re welcome, but you should get the rest of that suit off as soon as possible just in case... and since your clothes are on the floor there, I should be over here.&quot; <br />
<br />
As soon as she was out of the room and shut the door you were naked and fighting with your clothes. Leaning against a wall, you struggled with your socks and moved to your underwear where you realized your roomy boxers weren&#39;t nearly as roomy as you remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...&quot; your voice was deeper and more resonant than your normal 15 year old voice. Your panic began to rise as your hand went to your throat feeling not only a larger adam&#39;s apple, but stubble. &quot;Uhh...&quot; you cinched down your underwear finding the 9 inch penis and bulbous testicles that crossed your mind from a porno, when you tried to think of your penis and balls.<br />
<br />
Less focused on dressing, and more on assessing the damage, you noticed everything about your body was off, your height, your build, body hair... You held your pants up to your legs and saw you were several inches taller, just from the waist down, and trying to get a single leg in felt like you were trying to put on toddler clothes as your calf muscle didn&#39;t want to go past the knee of the pants.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to expose yourself to Jillian, you saw a wardrobe in the corner. Investigating it you found spare wizard robes like your uncle wore, as well as an apron, and a coat. Grabbing one of the robes, you slipped it on and noticed the mirror on the inside of the wardrobe door. Yesterday you were an unremarkable 15 year old, now you looked at least 20. You had a lean muscular build, a huge endowment, heavy stubble, longer sandy brown hair instead of a dark brown buzz cut for summer, and green eyes instead of brown.<br />
<br />
You were handsome... That&#39;s a plus, but you were NOT who you were supposed to be. Grabbing your pants you pulled out your wallet, ignoring the 100 bucks your father gave you to not be too much of a burden, you went to your school ID. You saw none of your normal facial features... finishing puberty and merging your traits with countless men including a Hollywood actor, nameless porn stars, and you think you thought of a couple WWE stars, you are entirely unrecognizable. <br />
<br />
Putting the ID, then the wallet away in your tiny kid pants, you reached out to shut the wardrobe noticing a splash of color on your arm. lifting the sleeve of the robe you found that you also had a tattoo mimicking one of your favorite game characters. You don&#39;t even remember them crossing your mind! Wait they aren&#39;t even a real person!<br />
<br />
Collecting your shirt you closed the robe and exited the room. Jillian was waiting for you and gave a strange look as you exited the room in a robe holding your clothes rather than wearing them. &quot;Hey we have a slight problem with that spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think my mind wandered as I was thinking of my body and I came out different.&quot; You pulled your wallet back out and showed her your ID.<br />
<br />
Her mouth fell agape and you detected anger, shock, concern, and maybe a few other emotions before she said, &quot;You THINK your mind wandered?&quot; and left it hanging there. She closed her eyes and shook her head, presumably trying to find a solution.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are waiting for your uncle to come back.&quot; She finally said. &quot;The spell I cast may have let you change a little bit, but not like this.. even if it was your intent all along you couldn&#39;t have become this. No. There are some major spell interactions going on between the costume and the spell and I&#39;m afraid to add more magic to the mix. You have hands and aren&#39;t made of stuffing, count your blessings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; was all you could muster as a mix of emotions washed over you. Fear of being stuck like this, hope of being stuck like this, fear of your uncle being angry, excitement at being better than average... it was overwhelming. Before you knew it a boner was tenting the robe and threatening to slip out of the robe having already escaped your underwear, thankfully Jillian wasn&#39;t looking at you and was lost in thought. you excused yourself to the bathroom putting your new equipment through its preliminary paces.<br />
<br />
You returned 20 minutes later having waited for your erection to subside after ejaculation. Jillian looked at you with an unsure gaze, &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having just tested the associated equipment you felt you had quite the counterpoint if needed, instead you let her finish her thought, &quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I think you&#39;re you, mixed with the caricature of the idea of the person you got distracted by.&quot; she finished.<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m part Thor or his actor... How does that help us?&quot; You really didn&#39;t want to elaborate on everyone that crossed your mind.<br />
She gave an appraising stare followed by a smile, &quot;Oh, I see it, but not quite...&quot;, she paused thinking of how to explain. &quot;The bear suit didn&#39;t release you, we magically crowbarred it open with a more powerful spell, which forced it to revert because you changed and it had to reapply its magic to you. That&#39;s why you had to take the helmet off fast before it adjusted and turned you back into a teddy bear.&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot; <br />
&quot;SO! I supplied all the crowbar force, you supplied all the concept of who &#39;you&#39; are... Meaning, that by thinking of who someone else is, you probably picked up those traits...&quot;<br />
You gestured to your body in exasperation, &quot;I think I pointed that out to you...&quot;<br />
Jillian facepalmed, &quot;I&#39;m not talking just physically John. Mentally, Emotionally... If you&#39;re more Thor like you may have taken on some non physical character traits of his that you are aware of. If you thought of the actor, the same would apply based on what you know about the actor. I&#39;m trying to warn you to be careful of uncharacteristic behavior or feelings that could get you into trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
This took you aback, you know wrestler&#39;s and porn stars are actors but were thinking of their body, not specifying the role they were playing vs the person off screen. Obviously, all the actors you thought of worked out and ate right diligently, so that&#39;s not the worst trait you could pick up and that was all you knew about them. Your hand moved to the mostly hidden tattoo on your arm, the representation of your favorite video game avatar. He could be a problem... but you feel fine! You&#39;re sure its not nearly as severe as Jillian is making it out to be... your uncle will be back after 3 days. A much more tangible concern is clothes, and boy are you hungry!</p>
