<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tanya let herself into the apartment and dropped her backpack next to the door as she kicked off her shoes and took off her coat. Outer wear put where it was supposed to be, she collected her pack and headed for the living room, where she planned to watch her favourite show as she worked on her take home assignments. Seeing her cousin Damon was home, she made a face at him when he inquired about his mom and her mom, but refused to answer him Disliking him, she couldn&#39;t understand why he continued to live there and why he wouldn&#39;t move out.<br />
<br />
Not having any answer, she continued to ignore him as he demanded she answer his question. Heading into the living room, she flopped down on the couch. Pulling a TV tray closer, she proceeded to empty her backpack as she clicked on the television and thumbed through the channels until she reached the one she wanted.<br />
<br />
The one person he hadn&#39;t expected to run into was his brat cousin. Hoping it was either his mom or Aunt June come home, Damon almost turned around and headed back to his room. But figuring since it was just him and Tanya, he might as well as see what he could do to her. Standing in the doorway to the living room, watching as she upended her bag on the small table, he aimed the emitter at her. Pressing the button to scan her, any sound it made was drowned out by the TV, which Tanya turned up as a way to annoy him and to try and get him to go away. Seeing her profile now loaded on the remote, Damon turned away and headed back to his room, where he plugged the device into the computer.<br />
<br />
Profile appearing on the screen seconds after he&#39;d done this, Damon scrolled through it, reading the various bits of information. Thinking of all he could do, he settled on first switching her sex to male, leaving her gender as female, as he was curious to see what this would do, dropping her weight to about forty-eight pounds and her height to forty-seven inches. Deleting her mother and father, he smiled and resisted the urge not to start laughing as he entered the information her dad was a jackass, whilst her mother was a female jackass, which the Chronivac listed as a jenny/jennet. Going through her profile, he changed her name to Cassia, with no last name, then dropped her age to seven. Giving her the penis of a gorilla, he set her sexual preference to being attracted to male tigers, bears, and otters. Sniggering at this last bit, he made it so only he was aware of any changes, made her a street urchin, set her intelligence in the range of an owl to a turkey, made sure the changes would be permanent, saved the new profile and sent it to the emitter.<br />
<br />
Still trying not laugh out loud, he ejected the device. Sitting for a moment, he waited for a bit for the needed to burst out in a fit of giggles to pass before he stood. Heading back to the living room as quietly as he could, Damon peeked inside. Seeing Tanya was staring at the television, a pencil held loose in one hand, Damon aimed the remote at her. Waiting for a particular moment, the instant there was a loud sound from the show she was watching, he pressed the button to initiate the changes. Wanting to watch them happen, he instead contented himself to allow them to occur without his observation and sneaking away, he headed back to his room.<br />
<br />
From where she sat on the couch, Tanya knew she ought to be working on the assignment for class, but was more engrossed in the programme on the tv. Missing it as her cousin stepped into the doorway and aimed something at her, she blinked when there was a sudden bright flash of light from the show she was watching. Suddenly feeling off, she shifted in place, and as she felt a discomfort settle in her abdomen, then down into her groin, her mind flashed to what her mom informed her as to what girls undergo as they became women.<br />
<br />
The discomfort growing, as well as a sudden need to pee, she pushed away the tv tray. Standing, she hurried to the bathroom, where she just barely had enough time to get her pants and underwear down and sit down on the toilet. Bladder emptying, she groaned as the pain upped and began to grow beyond the two specific areas of her body. Finishing, she reached for some toilet paper, and as she started to feel as if someone was pressing on the top of her head and the bottoms of her feet, she reached between her legs to wipe herself. Dropping the wad of paper the instant it touched the area between her legs, she gasped not only at what she found there, but also what she was experiencing. Leaping up, kicking off her pants and panties, she peered down at her flat groin, which was steadily losing its flatness.<br />
<br />
Internal reproductive organs vanishing or redesigning themselves, her ovaries became testes and pushed themselves outward. As this happened, her clit and urethra fused together and began to migrate forward. Wanting to scream at what she was seeing, Tanya could only grunt in discomfort as her two-inch gorilla cock, complete with a baculum, and her nuts positioned themselves out front. As this happened, her androgen count rose whilst her female hormones dropped. Her body morphing as it became more and more that of a boy&#39;s body, Tanya soon found it harder and harder to focus and understand what was happening to her, now him. Touching the organ he now had which clearly said he was male, Cassia couldn&#39;t grasp why he had such a thing when a part of him insisted he shouldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Mind and age the last things to change, the dim-witted boy Tanya had become continued to stare at his male package a bit longer before he scooped up the underwear and pants on the floor. Not the least bothered they were a pair of girl&#39;s panties, white with a pastel floral print on them, Cassia put them on, then pulled on the jeans and buttoned up the three buttons. Looking about, he glanced at his reflection, and seeing a boy with long, full hair which came down to the midpoint of his back wearing a white shirt with Hello Kitty printed on it, a girls pair of jeans and white socks with a pink heel and toe, he cocked his head one way, then another. Struggling to comprehend what was off, he wandered out of the bathroom after some time. Seeing he was in a strange place, and not sure how he got there, Cassia headed in a direction he hoped was the way out. <br />
<br />
After some time of wandering about, he soon discovered Tanya&#39;s shoes, and not caring the pink, purple and white sneakers with Velcro straps were for a girl, he pulled them on as if they belonged to him, which, in a way, they did. Taking the coat Tanya had removed some time ago, the boy of seven exited the apartment and headed down the hall, not sure where he was going, but at the same time, not caring.<br />
<br />
Damon, who had watched this first from where he could see through his bedroom door, which he’d open a crack, then by following, grinned at the sight of the dim-witted boy his brat cousin had become. Thinking it was hilarious, especially as they were still wearing the same clothes as before, he considered stopping them as they left. But, changing his mind, he made sure the door was secure and locked, then headed back to his room. There, he deleted Tanya&#39;s profile, left the changes, then prepared himself for the next person he wanted to scan, who he hoped would be his mom, but figured he&#39;d settle for his aunt.</p>
