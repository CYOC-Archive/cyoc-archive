<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan listened to how his evil minded sister taunted him, and he would be the first to admit that she was correct in her assumption, as he looking at her his sister, he would rather mate with a doe goat!<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa-Naa,&quot; Dan bleating said to his sister, as much agreeing with her statement about how he had changed enough to prefer doe goats to women as lovers. He had changed with such swiftness that the devils doing the transformation had done their trade so well, Dan was doing some thinking, serious with intent as to how he would live his life being a buck goat. As time passed and dusk became the blacker a night than he ever seemed to remember, Katherine, his witch sister still wanted her big stud buck brother to sensually tickle her fancy. Kat lead Dan by her grabbing hold of one of his goat horns and she led him upstairs and then into her bedroom with such an obvious intent, even a male goat could reason what she wanted of him to do once the two were there.<br />
<br />
Dan stood before his sister, he as relaxed as he could keep himself, while knowing what she wanted of him to do. Dan knew not the word &quot;Incest,&quot; but what his sister was planning for him to do to her was in his half human, half goat buck mindset it seemed improper to as well wrong.<br />
<br />
As Kat slipped out of her clothes, Dan tried to ignore her and he walking, strolled toward the bedroom window, what by the elevation allowed him as a goat to see far as wide to where he might run when freed.<br />
<br />
Momenta later and a evil as seductive sister seeing her brother acting disinterested of her, she approached him from behind. Dan knew by the stronger scent of an aroused female that Kat was getting closer. He remained vigil to his want to deny his sister he delights. Although Kat knew about animals and the male when properly scented would become highly aroused and when blinded by his sex drive, then would mate. She poked two of her fingers up as inside her wetly aroused pussy and coating them with her seepage, she reached the two finger over the back of Dan, to try as smear her vaginal juices on his nostrils.<br />
<br />
Dan could smell what was coming his way and as the hand with the vile bile coated fingers came dangerously close, he stiffened his legs, whirling a turn about and ducking his head, he charged at Kat, giving her tummy a harsh goat buck bucking.<br />
<br />
The buck bucking knocked the wind out of Kat and she toppled over on her back lying then on the bedroom floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no you cannot refuse me,&quot; Kat said as she lied there gasping for her breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naa Baa...,&quot; Dan replied, he stepping over his sister to straddle her body with his four legs. Kat watched her goat-brother take a strange stand over her limp self lying on the bedroom floor. She rather liked the view of seeing just how large were the goat buck balls, and of his sheath, what she knew he held up inside of it, and of how she wanted to see it in action.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden there was an sort of action, but not what Kat was hoping to see. Dan feeling a sense of disdain for his sister as more than usual, he thought then to show his dislike, he released a firm hold of his bladder and from his sheath then rained a hot stream of goatish yellow-green urine what stank like piss and green grass from his having grazed for a while in the back lawn to the family home.<br />
<br />
Kat tried hard to sit up but doing so got her face and long hair as soaked better by the strong stream of stench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop pissing all over me,&quot; Kat as then angry she screamed aloud, or loud enough to awaken the household of her being in some sort of dismay.<br />
<br />
As the goat urine trailed down to being a trickling stream, Dan stepped away from standing over his then naked and well soaked sister. He felt safe in the realization she by her new as limited powers of magic could not do any worse to him, he knowing he would stay, as liking to remain permanently then as is a buck goat. The sounds of their parents getting up out of bed and half dressing before they would soon burst through the bedroom doorway and see there a large breed buck goat and a naked, piss soaked whore sister-daughter as a perverted scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa Naa, BAA...,&quot; Dan as much bellowed at his sister, as she hearing her parents coming along the upstairs hallway, as toward her bedroom, she did not want them to see her in this odd situation. As with a tangled waving of her hands to signify a simple spell of transferring a body from one place to another, Kat sent her big buck brother to suddenly leave the bedroom, the house, and he go as arrive at a goat farm she had seen some many miles from their home.<br />
<br />
As her bedroom door opened and two concerned parents walked into the room, Kat was in bed and under the blanket, she acting as if she had, had a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Kat looked as if she were wet from perspiration due to her wild dream, though the wet was of goat urine. &quot;Sorry mom, dad, I was having a bad dream!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad turned and walked out of the room, he acting as if satisfied by what his daughter said. Mom though being a witch for many a year knew the smell of animal piss, and she stood there as staring at her daughter, she asking said, &quot;Where is he, the animal who soaked your hair and face with his urine?&quot;</p>
