<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty reverted back to his teenage form as he walked down the deserted side street.  Rounding the corner, he passed by the ice cream shop, when something caught his attention.  Michael sat in one of the booths, drinking what seemed to be his fourth milkshake, with the waitress handing him two more.<br />
<br />
  Michael was one of Ty's newer friends.  He appeared to be a gentle giant of a guy, standing at 5'11&quot; and weighing 180 pounds.  He was always polite, and only made remarks when he felt someone was stepping out of line.  Ty also knew he was fiercely loyal to his friends.  It was an admirable quality.<br />
<br />
  He opened up the shop door and sat at Mike's table, curious to find the reason behind the many milkshakes.  Mike greeted him after polishing off number four, with a friendly &quot;Hey, Ty.&quot;  and started into shake number 5.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Mike... why are you drinking all those milkshakes?&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
  Taking one last gulp, Mike gave him the reason.  &quot;Well, there's two really.  First off, Mom and Dad were worried about me sitting around and drawing all the time, instead of having extra-curricular talents like my brothers.  They saw that with my size, I should go out for the wrestling team.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;I don't see the connection yet.  And that's only one reason.&quot;  Ty said.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Well, I was put into the 180-210 bracket.  Which would make me the smallest in that division.  I'll get pulverized if I don't gain some weight, even though I don't want to be on the team.&quot;  Mike said with another sip of the chocolate shake.  &quot;The other reason is a bit more personal.  I don't know if I should tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Come on Mike.  You can tell me anything.&quot;  Ty said with a wink.  Michael didn't know why, but he knew he could tell Ty, and so he did.  &quot;Well Ty... I'm a gainer.  I want to be fat.  With puberty, I've gained a good 50 pounds since the seventh grade, but I've been stuck at 180 since I turned 16.  I just can't pack on any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Ty rubbed his chin.  Michael was a gainer, which was an interesting fact.  Plus, this nice guy was unhappy for a number of reasons involving his weight.  Ty knew he could fix them all though.  <br />
<br />
  &quot;Mike, 210 is the last weight bracket at the school.  Right?&quot;  Ty said.  Michael nodded in agreement. &quot;So... if you were to weigh... say.. 220, Would you be kicked off?&quot;  Michael thought it over &quot;No, they'd probably make me work off the extra ten.  If I were 240 or 250 though, I doubt they could do anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;And as a gainer, you wouldn't be opposed to being that big?&quot;  Ty asked.  Michael chuckled  &quot;Hell no!  I'd fight my way up to immobility if I could gain any more.  Why are you so interested in this?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Ty tossed some money on the table and pulled Mike from his seat.  &quot;Come on Mike.  I may just be able to help.&quot;  He said as they flew out the door.  He dragged him all the way through town to Mike's own house, and they went up to his room.  Mike sat on the bed as Ty paced in thought.  &quot;Mike, you're a good guy, so I'm gonna help you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Ty closed his eyes and made a wish out loud.  &quot;I wish that Mike would gain 70 pounds of fat, within the hour.&quot;  Ty looked at Mike and said &quot;There.  Your problem is solved.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Michael looked at Ty with a look of amusement.  &quot;Ty, it just doesn't work that way. Now, I've got practice tomorrow, so I've got to sleep.&quot;  Ty smiled and said &quot;Yeah, I suppose it can never be that easy.  I'll be seeing more of you tomorrow.&quot;  Ty turned from the door and made a silent wish, and he left.<br />
<br />
  Mike tried to figure out Ty's last statement.  &quot;I'll be seeing more of you tomorrow.&quot;  He thought nothing of it, and went to bed.  <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
  The electric buzz of the alarm clock startled Mike out of bed.  He jumped up to get ready.  He muddled around in the dim morning light for his clothes, pulling out a pair of jeans and a shirt.  He went to the bathroom to put them on.  <br />
<br />
 He pulled on the dark denim, and zipped the fly.  He got to the button, and struggled.  The pants wouldn't cinch.  He looked into the mirror, and noticed something that shocked him.  His stomach was building up over the waist.  He jumped on the scale as it inched up to 190 pounds.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Wow, those milkshakes really did the trick....&quot;  He left the pants unbuttoned, and started to brush his teeth.  He began to feel warm.  He shook it off and turned off the faucet.  He noticed that the sound of the water pouring didn't seem to stop, and he was feeling even warmer.  He looked down as his body exploded with mass.<br />
<br />
  His stomach poured out over his waist band, rolls grew up over the sides of the jeans.  His chest swelled up and became somewhat feminine as he grew breasts.  He tossed off the jeans as they became tighter.  He blew up and out as his weight climbed like an escalator on overdrive.  His stomach flopped down over his groin, and his thighs met for the first time.  His arms became soft as his biceps disappeared below added fat.  His boxers strained under the added weight, and blew off his body.<br />
<br />
  The growth wasn't stopping.  A thought came to him, what Ty had said. &quot;I'll be seeing a lot more of you tomorrow....&quot;  He jumped on the scale, which caused his entire body to jiggle.  His butt bounced with his boobs and belly.  He tried to see over his gargantuan gut, as the scale whirred around to 250 pounds.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Holy shit.... I've gotta call Ty!&quot;</p>
