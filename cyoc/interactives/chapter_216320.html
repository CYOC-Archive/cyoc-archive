<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The claw s reached for the coffin-<br />
<br />
And grabbed Charlie around his waist and neck!<br />
<br />
Charlie yelped and squirmed, but the claws squeezed him tighter, choking him. Charlie felt the serrated steal around his neck threatening to scissor his head off his body, and he begrudgingly went still. <br />
<br />
Its prey seemingly subdued, the Spider Golem lifted Charlie up and over to the processing machine. Keeping a claw around his neck, the golem used its other claw to bring out a fresh crystalline coffin, which Charlie was promptly stuffed inside.<br />
<br />
The wolf tried pounding on the hardened material – to no effect. It had a strange give to it, like his blows were shaking the whole box and not really impacting the area he intended.<br />
<br />
So, magically reinforced, then. Likely dispersing the force of the impacts. Wait, if it was magical, maybe his knife-<br />
<br />
The coffin was jammed into the processing chamber. <br />
<br />
Charlie felt a nozzle poke up from the floor. He couldn’t really see it so well, but with a soft hissing sound, thick vapor spewed forth. The air in the coffin began to fill with whisps of green smoke, and Charlie briefly thought about how the smoke seemed like a cliché movie knockout gas.  Then he realized – that’s exactly what it was.<br />
<br />
Acting quickly, he wrapped a bandanna around his nose and mouth. Then he took out his knife and cut a section of cloth from his shirt. Taking the fabric, he stuffed it into the nozzle’s opening. The cloud of vapor made his leg muscles tingle but rose no further than his waist.<br />
<br />
But even though the paralyzing gas had stopped midway up the chamber, Charlie realized that his hands were growing numb. The knife in his hand grew heavier and heavier as sensation left his fingers and his hands began to relax.  Charlie darted his eyes around the coffin, desperate to find some crack or seem that would let him escape, but as he looked towards the top of the coffin, he found himself staring straight into the red light of the golem’s eyes.<br />
<br />
A red wave washed over Charlie, striking him like a wall of pure tingly pleasure. All his clothing and armor unraveled under the ruby glow, the knife at the bottom of the coffin melting away. Once his clothing had dissolved, the hum increased. His cock went hard, slapping against the soft fur on his belly.<br />
<br />
Charlie whined as that soft fur began to sink into his body, changing from a fluffy, thick coat and becoming dense, short and sleek. The color began to shift, going from midnight black to a near-bone white. His chest rose and fell with every breath, growing a bit larger as he bathed in the warm light.<br />
<br />
The pleasure increased and Charlie’s muscles felt suddenly tense. <br />
<br />
He let out a snarl and flexed, stretching his arms and shoulders. A pop came from his back as the warmth and tingles pulled his shoulder wider, growing further and further apart to match the wolf’s barreling chest. Charlie looked down just in time to watch his feet sink from view as the mass on his chest increased, his pecs gaining more definition before they surged into massive shelves of muscles. The wolf’s eyes bulged in disbelief as he realized he couldn’t see his lower body while standing up.<br />
<br />
The changes swept down his body slowly, centering on his core.<br />
<br />
“Guh-Ungh!” Charlie grunted deeply.<br />
<br />
Charlie shuddered as his back spasmed, then doubled over as his abs tightened and widened in his arms. His abdominals quivered and bulged, going from a solid 8-pack to a hefty twelve, the muscles obvious and defined thanks to the short coat of fur his body now possessed.<br />
<br />
The light hit his groin and a soft whine escaped his lips, his cock twitching and tingling, his body sweaty and hot.<br />
<br />
While Charlie was busy dealing with the incredible pleasure in his dick, the real changes were taking place on his backside. His thick tail grew thinner, limp from the strange vapor. His buttocks grew larger as the wolf’s hips cracked and widened to better support his huge torso, while the muscles of his butt swelled and bulged into a perfectly round rump.<br />
<br />
The warmth tingled in his thighs as they swelled and the thick cords flexed and tensed, growing larger with every movement. They grew so large around that even with his wider hips they started rubbing against each other, forcing Charlie to adjust his stance. <br />
<br />
And as Charlie shifted his legs, he couldn’t help but notice that his paws had grown meatier, growing longer and wider to help support his new frame.<br />
<br />
Charlie whined, the sound a deep reverberation, perfect for the muscular canine he now was. <br />
<br />
His balls churned and swelled, increasing in density and size as they grew larger. Each warm, pulsing wave of light made them bulge from ping pong balls to tennis balls. Lust pounded on Charlie’s mind as his sack grew taut, the mass of his huge balls pulling him forward as they continued to swell to the size of softballs.<br />
<br />
Testosterone flooded through his veins, pumped by his swelling heart. His muscles swelled ever larger and more vascular. His cock felt like it was going to burst, swelling wider and thicker under the tingly ray. It jolted forward and inch at a time, growing more sensitive. His breath came in hot yelps and yips, Charlie’s mind was entirely on his turgid, foot-long dick as his knot inflated.<br />
<br />
His skull began to shift, the wolf’s muzzle growing square and boxy. The warmth increased as his face popped and shifted. His forehead and brow snapped and cracked, jutting forward. His yellows eyes faded, becoming a dull maroon color. <br />
<br />
Charlie wanted to jerk himself off, to touch his dick as the pleasure grew and grew, but his paws were numb, incapable of moving or gripping anything. The red light shut off and the enormous mutt whined as the pleasure vanished, allowing his mind to return from the carnal bliss-induced.<br />
<br />
Charlie was panting. He was still conscious, and he seemed to still have his mind. If he could just last until the vapor wore off, he might be able to get away with his sanity intact.<br />
<br />
The side of the coffin slammed into Charlie as the golem picked it up and carried him over to a slab.<br />
<br />
Charlie gasped as the coffin tipped horizontally and the thick vapor crept up his back and shoulders. The tingling instantly set in, and he soon found himself completely immobilized. But… the vapor was starting to dissipate. He could tell that it might actually wear off.<br />
<br />
He waited for a few minutes and the vapor cleared, though the warm numbness remained.<br />
<br />
If he was right, in another few minutes without the vapor, he should have complete mobility returned to his limbs. The longer it took the Spider Golem to place a disk on his temple the better. It might be close, but if he could move, he could remove the disk.<br />
<br />
He could see the Spider Golem moving out of the far corner of his eyes. It was coming down his row next. He could feel his fingers begin to twitch.<br />
<br />
Just a few more minutes.<br />
<br />
The Spider Golem crept closer and closer. Charlie noticed that it didn’t move to the next coffin until the pitbull inside the one it was currently working on had ejaculated. The time it took was anywhere from a single minute to as long as five. Charlie prayed for more five minute-orgasms, but those were few and far between.<br />
<br />
Then his own lid was lifted away.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep like the others. Charlie could feel the golem’s gaze linger on him, but thankfully there was no ruby glow. Perhaps it was his breathing? He tried to keep his breath as steady as a sleeper.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, he felt the Spider Golem press a cold disc to his temple.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Charlie felt the magical item glow and begin whatever process would turn the newly transformed pitbull into a loyal soldier. Heat pressed into his brain from his temple as the disc throbbed, muffling his thoughts and cutting the connections between past and present.<br />
<br />
Soothing colors bloomed in his mind and it felt like Charlie’s body was slowly being submerged in a warm bath. The pleasant warmth washed over him as the colors shifted to a beat. It was rhythmic and made the former wolf feel more and more relaxed. Comfort trickled down his spine and made Charlie’s toes tingle.<br />
<br />
A pitbull appeared in his mind’s eye, handsome, muscular and regal, fur pale as bone and covered in rich adornments of pure gold and ruby. Or perhaps he had always been there in the shifting patterns of the colors and the pulse of the disc on Charlie’s temple. Whatever it may have been, it didn’t matter, and Charlie found himself being drawn in by the pitbull’s warm, sincere smile.<br />
<br />
“Greetings, Chosen One. I am Ajax Kinderschredder.” Ajax’s voice was deep and compelling and made Charlie’s ears tickle. <br />
<br />
“I am your master.” The pitbull’s fur rippled with color as he spoke. “Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
Charlie could feel the numbness begin to recede. He just needed to resist for another minute or so. The former wolf opened his mouth.<br />
<br />
“My name is Charlie and I’m a wolf.”<br />
<br />
A blast of lights and colors flashed in Charlie’s head. <br />
<br />
The pulse at his temple was so strong that it made his toes curl. His dick was throbbing angrily, so hard it almost hurt. It felt like a large, softly padded paw had gripped it and…<br />
<br />
Fuck, it was Ajax. Charlie could see the pitbull slipping his cock into the pitbulls mouth, those ruby eyes of his staring up at Charlie as he… wait, when had Charlie gotten so hard?<br />
<br />
But Ajax’s voice was in his head, drowning out the former wolf’s question. <br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
Charlie had to fight to ignore the command. But every time he managed to muster a disobedient though, a flash of lights stopped that thought dead in its tracks<br />
<br />
“I’m a wolf, not a pit-!”<br />
<br />
Another blast of lights flashed through his mind. The pleasure pounded through him as Ajax pleasured the… wolf? <br />
<br />
Charlie tried to hold onto his mind, to hold onto himself. He was supposed to do something. I-ignore the pleasure or something, right?<br />
<br />
Another flash of lights while he tried to contemplate his answer made him forget what he was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
If this was a fight, he was starting to lose. The pitbull’s words were so kind yet stern. His tail was wagging, like he was eager for Charlie to just stop fighting him and join him. Why… why was Charlie fighting again?<br />
<br />
“I-I’m Charlie-ungff!”<br />
<br />
The colors were like flashbulbs going off in his head now. Ajax was pleasuring Charlie in every way imaginable. Charlie, in turn, was eagerly rimming his mast-the pitbull in return. His temple throbbed, his own cock throbbing in tandem. <br />
<br />
Charlie wanted to stop fighting, to let go and just give in to the magnificent canine.<br />
<br />
His hips were bucking uncontrollably now. He could try to stop doing that or he could try to remember what it was he was forgetting. But he couldn’t decide, and as the thoughts grew old, Charlie failed at doing either of those things.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
“I’m ngh-guh! I’m unhh..gah!”<br />
<br />
The next series of flashes caused the irises of Charlie’s eyes to begin to grow smaller with every new scenario the colors conjured up. The newly-minted pitbull twitched and writhed with as much movement as the numbness in his limbs allowed. His past life drizzled away as the precum drooled from his cock. It was horrifying but oddly, freeing.<br />
<br />
Charlie’s delighted moans flowed freely as did his precum.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
“I-I-I… Gah! P-please!” Charlie begged.<br />
<br />
Another blast of confounding colors, another wave of pleasurable warmth along with the throbbing lustful images. <br />
<br />
It was like a thousand tongues were licking every orifice of his body. His dick strained so hard, but the orgasm that was just a second away never came. Every time his brain got used to the pleasure, a new wave of bliss crashed through the disc that throbbed at his temple and annihilated any chance he had at collecting himself.<br />
<br />
Charlie’s past life had almost fully faded away now. All he knew was the love of Ajax, the feeling of his cock inside of him, muzzle around Charlie’s own hotly pulsing dick. Ajax was his all, his everything.<br />
<br />
Why was he resisting? What was he resisting? He couldn’t remember anymore.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
“I’m-Ugh!”<br />
<br />
Blast.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
“I’mma wol-Ungggah!” Charlie whined helplessly, his thin tail wagging.<br />
<br />
Blast.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.” <br />
<br />
“Ung unh uh?” <br />
<br />
Another blast came and suddenly the pitbull’s cock was inside of Charlie, stretching him out impossibly, deforming him around its mighty head. <br />
<br />
He knew Ajax’s thick dick intimately, every throbbing inch. The slight bend at the end of his beautiful shaft, the vein that got so big when Master was really turned on. Charlie especially loved the masculine scent of His musk.<br />
<br />
Charlie was like a condom, the pounding in his temple like the throb of the blood rushing through the pitbull’s meaty length. The pleasure was all encompassing, taking up all his attention, all his thoughts-<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me: You are my soldier, my tool, my slave.”  <br />
<br />
“I’m your soldier, your tool, your slave.” Charlie replied.<br />
<br />
The words came out of Charlie’s mouth as effortlessly as breathing. With them came intense relief. Those words made everything feel right, because Master was always right. His voice made everything seem so bright. Charlie was his soldier, his tool, his slave. It was just obvious.<br />
<br />
As Charlie panted, the pitbull’s image wavered. Master stepped forward and gently patted Charlie on his head.<br />
<br />
“Good boy” Ajax said.<br />
<br />
There came a final celebratory blast of color and light.<br />
<br />
Charlie took a deep breath, wanting to howl his pleasure. Instead, a strangled yelp was all that managed to escape from the pitbull’s throat. His entire body shook from an orgasm that could not be denied any longer. Rope after rope of creamy pitbull jism splattered across his abs, his muzzle, gushed across the crystal lid of the coffin. <br />
<br />
He came until he couldn’t anymore, because the Master wouldn’t let him do anything else. With those final spurts of cum, he forgot his name and species, the former wolf’s personality running down the lid of the coffin and pooling in a rapidly cooling puddle around his paws. <br />
<br />
When he was done, all he could do was gurgle in pure bliss. All things considered, it had been the most enjoyable thirty seconds of the pitbull&#39;s life.<br />
 <br />
It didn’t matter that he didn’t know his name. Master would give him one. It felt right to be His big dog and to serve him. He felt like a Good Boy.<br />
<br />

<br />
With a *pop*, a hugely muscled anthro pitbull appeared on the stone floor of Finn’s lair.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, just like that, little one!” Finn groaned, bucking hips into a blue-scaled kobold’s maw while the pitbull waited quietly for the dragon to finish.<br />
<br />
Finn glimpsed the pitbull out of the corner of his eye.<br />
<br />
“Hey Charlie!” Finn cocked a brow. “Gotta say, the brainwashed soldier look suits you.”<br />
<br />
“My name is Charon, gifted to me by the Master.” Charon cocked his head. “Who is this ‘Charlie’?”<br />
<br />
“He’s why you’re here.” Finn said. “You failed.”<br />
<br />
“Failed?” Charon frowned. “I faithfully followed my Master’s orders and converted everyone I came across or captured into useful products or into fellow warriors. We conquered the known world. I believe you are mistaken.”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, I see. Completely wiped clean by that device, huh?” Fin chuckled. “You were a wolf before you were converted. You didn’t win, Charon.  Charlie lost.  You lost.”<br />
<br />
“No,” the pitbull stated bluntly. “I have served my master faithfully for a thousand years.”<br />
<br />
“But… you are here, no? Did you die?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“How?”<br />
<br />
“I swam five miles out to sea for a drowning toddler.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, so you heroically drowned trying to save a toddler.” Finn nodded. “Truly a hero to the end, then.”<br />
<br />
“Save?” Charon cocked his head. “I mean, for later, sure. I wasn’t going to eat him in the middle of the ocean.”<br />
<br />
….<br />
<br />
…..<br />
<br />
The dragon glanced down at the kobold nuzzling his cock and back at the pitbull.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just call it a wash, then. Lucky for you, this isn’t….”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The End<br />
