<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So you really were an actress?&quot; Tricia looked at the picture of the Indian woman when she was much younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The elderly woman saw the picture Tricia was looking at. The young teen had been so polite to get the glass of water for her from the bathroom even though she didn&#39;t have to. &quot;I had tried for a few roles in Bollyworld but I could only get minor parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia was curious about this old woman who was obviously renting the room from the family. This might be what Katie felt about them when Tricia and her friends were older. But she didn&#39;t want to just make her younger without permission but she did need some proof.<br />
<br />
So silently she made the request from the Ring and watched as the woman in her mid-seventies started to get younger. Black hair started to appear where white and grey was previously. Wrinkles started to disappear from her face as she went through her sixties.<br />
<br />
Padma felt so much better than she did in many years. She saw her face in the mirror and gasped. The woman in the mirror was in her early fifties. &quot;But-but how?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia smiled that even though Padma had been completely surprised, she seemed very happy at the same time. &quot;I did this. I&#39;m just wondering, would you like to become even younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma looked in the mirror and thought about it for a minute. She didn&#39;t have any living family or many close friends. But her boarders. . .<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to be young, I can always make it so they think they were boarding a younger person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then yes. Yes so much.&quot; Padma studied herself as the years were peeled away. The matrony woman was slowly being replaced by the woman who wanted to be an actress. She could tell her thirties had been a lot kinder to her than what she had originally though. And her twenties, Padma still thought that it had been her singing that had cost her an acting career not her looks.<br />
<br />
As the eighteen year girl looked over her perky well shaped form, Padma was really excited for the first time in a long time.<br />
<br />
Padma looks over her teenage form with a great amount of happiness. To the India-born woman, this was a dream come true. A second chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;ThankyouThankyou.&quot; Padma leans down and kisses Tricia before she thought about the age difference.<br />
<br />
Tricia was quite surprised but was just barely of the age to enjoy this. Without thinking about it, she kissed Padma back and had the thought that things might&#39;ve been difference if they had met earlier that night.<br />
<br />
Padma felt a bit off as she kissed Tricia a few more times. It was as though she had to adjust her head to keep her lips on Tricia&#39;s, but it was not right to make out with someone that young. Though a four year difference was not so bad.<br />
<br />
Tricia started to really get into kissing Padma as it become easier to do so. Before she had to really tilt her head back. . . wait a moment. Tricia looked down to see her fifteen year old form that was continuing to mature. She thought about stopping her aging but everything felt too nice to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tricia.&quot; Tricia had gotten taller and curvier than Padma as she became seventeen. Tricia&#39;s hands were kneading Padma&#39;s rear as Tricia became the same age and then older than Padma.<br />
<br />
Padma was so happy to become younger but there were a few confused thoughts. Thoughts that more thankful that a college student like Tricia was willing to teach a senior in high school like herself.<br />
<br />
Tricia had been hesitant at first but she was really getting into making out with Padma. The College Age woman quickly stripped off the top of the cheerleader outfit, showing her abundant bust to Padma.<br />
<br />
Padma who was quite apprecative with her kisses leading down to Tricia&#39;s breasts, making Tricia moan slightly as Padma didn&#39;t stop kissing even as she stripped off Tricia&#39;s bra.<br />
<br />
Tricia returned the favor by slipping the loose robe off of Padma, showing that the Indian woman hadn&#39;t been wearing a bra at all.<br />
<br />
The lovers start to the bed when a sudden knocking sounded at their door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey are you in there Tricia. Kellie wanted you to know we are about to leave in a minute.&quot; Tricia knew that Mary Elise would have fun with this if they opened the door like this.<br />
<br />
Tricia quickly put her bra and cheerleader shirt on while Padma retied her robe. They both looked over themselves for any sort of hint of what they were doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn it Tricia, we&#39;ve got to - &quot; Mary knocked the door even harder and Tricia opened the door. &quot;-go soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mary, I&#39;m ready to go.&quot; The redhead in the adorable nurse outfit looked at Tricia and then Padma and then back again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is this Tricia?&quot; Before Tricia could answer Mary gave a knowing smile. &quot;So this is your new gurrlfriend.&quot; Tricia jerked slightly. &quot;I was right. Were you going to invite her to the party?&quot;</p>
