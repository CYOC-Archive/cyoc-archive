<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a stroke of pure luck that Frank and Landen lived a block away from each other. That way, they were able to meet up easily before walking two blocks to the small strip mall where the gym was located. For Landen it had become a daily routine to work out in the gym whereas for Frank it was all new since this was only his first day. <br />
<br />
Over the next three days, Landen would walk over to Frank’s house and knock on the door around 4 in the afternoon, after school was over. The boys would walk over to the gym and have their work out there, which Landen planned out in advance before leaving the house. <br />
<br />
On Tuesday, the boys worked their arms, doing bicep curls and cable pulls, which worked the triceps. They also used dumbbells in the free-weights section for the arm curls, and so far, Frank was comfortable with the ten-pound dumbbells. When Landen encouraged him to try one set using heavier weights, he managed to workout with fifteen pounds. It was a struggle at first, but it became easier as he did more reps. <br />
<br />
On Wednesday, the boys did legs, where they did squats on the smith machine using 25-pound plates and a 20-pound bar, so their starting weight was seventy pounds. Frank struggled at first, but he got better at it during the next set. He upped the weight by adding 10-pound plates and ended up lifting ninety pounds. They also did the leg press, and the leg extension machines, where Frank did well. He didn’t want to do anything with arms that day because his arms and shoulders were feeling a bit sore from the previous day, which was normal for a beginner. <br />
<br />
On Thursday, the boys worked their abdominal muscles, chest and shoulders using the lat-pulldown machine. They also went to the cable tower and used the cable for chest flies. Again, Frank was feeling some soreness in his quads this time, so he wanted to skip doing anything with his legs. <br />
<br />
Finally, when Friday rolled around, Landen was in for a shock when the boys arrived at the gym. Frank was wearing long-sleeved shirt and long sweatpants, which didn’t get removed until the boys were in the locker room before starting their workout. Once the shirt and sweats came off and Frank slipped on a tank top and shorts, Landen saw a significant difference in Frank’s physique for the very first time. <br />
<br />
Standing before him, was the same 13-year-old boy. However, his biceps were big, wide, and round, like footballs. His triceps were sticking out like large mounds from the back of his upper arms. Not only that, but Frank’s pectorals were significantly larger, deeper, and wider than before, jutting out from his frame by a few inches. His broad shoulders gave him a wide V-taper, since his waist was tight and narrow while his stomach was covered by an impressive six-pack of abdominal muscles which resembled a kitchen washboard. His quads were so thick, so deep, and so wide, he barely fit in his shorts. Long teardrops of thick muscle mounds covered the front of his quads as a network of veins ran across his bulging calves, which were as big as soccer balls. <br />
<br />
“HEY! What happened to you?” Landen gasped as he examined his VERY muscular friend. “You’re totally JACKED!” <br />
<br />
“What? Where?” Frank asked him.<br />
<br />
“What? What do you mean? LOOK AT YOU!” Landen shouted as he pulled on Frank’s arm and dragged him towards the large mirror. There, Landen pointed his finger at Frank’s big, bulging bicep and his huge pectorals. “What’s this? And this? Where did all this muscle come from?” <br />
<br />
“I dunno! I’ve been working out here with you every day, nothing else!” Frank shrugged his broad shoulders. <br />
<br />
“WHAT? Are you working out at your house when I’m in school?” <br />
<br />
“No! I’m doing an online class! I’m homeschooled, remember?” Frank explained. <br />
<br />
“Hmm… You’re not taking steroids, are you?” Landen asked angrily, with his arms folded in front of his chest. <br />
<br />
“NO! Absolutely NOT! I don’t have the money to buy steroids and I wouldn’t even know where to get them! Besides, my parents would kill me!” <br />
<br />
“How did you get so BUFF? Come, get over to the table over here!” Landen ordered. <br />
Landen dragged Frank over to a small, wooden table near the corner of the locker room. Then, he placed his elbow on the table.<br />
<br />
“What… What are you doing?” <br />
<br />
“We’re arm-wrestling! I wanna FEEL your strength! Give me a hand. NOW!” Landen ordered. <br />
<br />
Frank sighed as he placed his elbow on the table next to Landen’s. They locked their right hands together and held their arms in the vertical position.<br />
<br />
“Okay, give it all you got to push my arm down. On three. ONE… TWO… THREE!” Landen shouted. <br />
<br />
Landen’s arm shivered as a big ball of muscle swelled up on Frank’s arm. Frank began to push Landen’s arm down, slowly, and gradually.<br />
<br />
“AAARRGHHHHH!” Landen groaned loudly.<br />
<br />
After about four seconds, Frank had easily forced Landen’s arm down on the wooden table. He was not even breaking a sweat. It was easy. <br />
<br />
“Man, you weren’t even trying!” Frank said, as he let go of Landen’s arm. “You let me win!”<br />
<br />
“Bullshit! I gave it all I got!” Landen cried out, still shaking the pain out of his hand. “You… You’re a LOT stronger than me!” <br />
<br />
The two boys just stared at each other for a moment. Frank really didn’t know what to say. <br />
<br />
“So… Are we still working out, or not?” Frank finally asked him. <br />
<br />
“Yeah! Let’s get you to lift MORE weight, this time. I wanna see how BIG you’re gonna get after this workout!” Landen smiled. “I’m gonna make you lift MORE weight and MORE reps!” <br />
<br />
“It’s a deal, Coach!” Frank just smiled. <br />
<br />
“I’m gonna push you to your limits and then some. See what happens!” Landen grinned. <br />
<br />
The boys strolled to the free weights area where they started their workout.</p>
