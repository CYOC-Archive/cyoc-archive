<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When there was finally no screaming, Molly was able to breathe a little. &quot;That&#39;s what you get for being rude!&quot;<br />
<br />
After calming down, Molly looked back at the necklace in her hand and her eyes sparkled with excitement, the face of an excited little girl should be something cute to see, but the boys in front of her didn&#39;t feel so relaxed. &quot;Today is game day, today I want to play fairies!&quot;. Molly finally gave herself the task of taking a close look at the fairy boys in front of her, she felt a little sorry for them for their current state, so first of all, she released them from the grasp of hands.<br />
<br />
The boys were a little happy to see that Molly still seemed somewhat interested in helping them and they were even more hopeful when Molly said &quot;I wish fairies had clothes&quot;, it didn&#39;t last long anyway. Out of nowhere, small items of clothing began to appear on their bodies, they began as a small piece and little by little they took shape, however, the shape it took did not please the boys, when they realized, they all had wearing pretty and colorful dresses with flower-like shapes, even the colors matched they hair color! It seemed that there was no such thing as clothing for fairy men, so the necklace simply gave them &#39;fairy clothes&#39;. Mark&#39;s dress looked like it was made out of roses, it was strapless but didn&#39;t ride down and hit mid-thigh, Evan&#39;s was blue with one strap and came down to her calves, Dan&#39;s seemed to be made of Sunflowers, it was yellow, and it stood up a little at the ends, reaching to her thighs and, like Mark&#39;s, seemed to be magically attached not to slide down even without straps. Bill&#39;s was the shortest of all, it came down a bit below his butt which ironically made him feel more naked than before, it was green and looked like it was from a tree leaf and like Evan he only had a strap. Lots of disgust bells rang after that.<br />
<br />
Molly looked at them in amazement, the four dresses looked super cute, she also laughed a little when she saw the four red boys up to their ears, they even seemed more expressive than before. Still, she felt it was weird to see guys with mostly muscular builds wearing such pretty dresses &quot;The dresses are gorgeous but you guys still don&#39;t look like real fairies... I wish you&#39;d look more like fairies!&quot; The voices / bells were interrupted for a second with a big gasp only to return higher and faster, the four boys tried to tell her to stop but none of her voices managed to form words. They can&#39;t help but watch helplessly as they began to get even smaller, their shoulders hunched, the hours in the gym gone, giving way to cute, slender arms, as well as tiny, delicate hands and feet, and paint on their faces and nails that matched their dresses and hair, their legs widened and their waists shrank, giving them an hourglass figure that made their dresses look even better, their hair grew rapidly, it even reached below their backs. In Bill&#39;s case, her hair was longer than her dress, her hair not only grew but tied itself into a high ponytail. Their faces took on exaggeratedly feminine features, so much so that they didn&#39;t know they were the same, they couldn&#39;t really tell who was who. Then came the worst for them, the top of their dresses moved by themselves to the front, leaving an empty space big enough for them to see their nipples, but little by little their nipples were moving forward, being filled little by little until they were properly formed as women&#39;s breasts, four pairs of C-size tits had appeared! Afterwards they could feel a familiar sensation in their lower parts, they felt how little by little their penises were receding towards their body, Bill, Mark and Dan were able to easily lift their clothes to know exactly what was happening, Evan struggled a lot more but he was also able to say goodbye to the masculinity as it was once again erased from existence. Once there was nothing coming out of them, they can still say that it was not over, they felt how little by little something was spreading inside them, it was their new vagina and womb that were appearing inside them.<br />
<br />
When it was all done they could only look at each other in horror. They had officially become fairies, female fairies. Dan really couldn&#39;t take it and fell to his knees, he started to cry but instead of sobs there were only jingles.<br />
<br />
Molly wasn&#39;t really aware of what she was doing, for while the boys were too busy watching all that was left of his masculinity slip away, she was searching in the basement for something she could play with the fairies. Especially she was looking at the old closet. Suddenly an idea came to her and she said &quot;I want this closet to become a perfect castle for fairies to live in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the cupboard began to change too, its cut wood began to come alive again, it grew as high as the cellar ceiling would allow it, it bent and many green leaves began to grow out of it, even under it it began to grow some grass, until it finally grew into a big tree. At the junction of its strongest branches with the trunk, holes began to form that had a shape similar to an entrance, the perfect size for fairies. Light began to come out of those holes until they were covered by leaves of the same tree as a of door.<br />
<br />
Molly was entranced by this, so she turned to the fairies and decided...</p>
