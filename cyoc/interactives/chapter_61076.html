<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff kept on thinking about all his options in transforming into any type of food.  But as he was looking, he came up with a really good decision.  Sometimes he had the tendencies to eat healthy and tried a number of foods that he liked.  But one of his all personal favorite fruits were bananas.  They always come with skin in them to peel with and bite after bite; it’s always so juicy.  Thinking about it, he wondered what would feel like to be a banana itself.  All covered in the skin itself and not worry about life around you.  It would be really peaceful.  Even if you were eaten alive, it would be a wonderful life, if it was short lived.  So without a second thought, Jeff decided to transform himself into a banana.<br />
<br />
He went to the information section and started to type down what he wants.  First, he typed down what type of food he wants to be, which is of course a banana.  Then he typed how long the transformation would take.  He decided that ten minutes would be an efficient way to transform gradually.  The next is how long he has to stay as a banana.  Though he liked to remain like that forever, he couldn’t risk it even for a once in a lifetime opportunity.  So he decided to stay as a Banana for an hour.  A very reasonable slot for someone who wants to be his favorite food.  Next came the multiple-choice part.  The first one is that if the Chonoviac wants to change him mentally.  If Jeff wants to feel like a banana, he also wants to think like one.  So he chooses yes as his option.  Second was whether or not he should be aware of the changes.  Jeff intentionally clicked yes because he needs to feel everything from beginning to end.  The third option was if he wants to change his reality.  Though he liked being a banana, he doesn’t want to change his reality, since he’s going to remain a fruit for an hour.  So Jeff put no on that option.  Lastly, there was a text box at the end describing how the transformation will be like.  Curious about this, he decided to write down what his change would be like.  First, he wants his clothes to melt away off his body, then as it goes to the floor, they would harden and shape into that of a banana peel.  After that, he wants the change to happen at the tips of his toes to the top of his head.  Plus, when the change the mental change will take place, making him forget about his memories, education, and his livelihood, only to be replaced by one thought, to be a banana.  Once all the information was taken care of, Jeff moved the mouse over to the start button and pressed it.  At that moment, a pop up window came out of it, showing a timer with the number 10:00 on it.  When the window counted backwards to a seconds, Jeff knew that his changes have just started.<br />
<br />
For the first few seconds, he could feel his clothing getting a little wet.  Looking down, Jeff soon realized that his clothing was beginning to liquefy and was loosing its texture.  He quickly got out of his chair and approached the middle of his room to prevent any of his furniture from getting wet.  He kept on watching as his shirt, pants, belt, shoes, socks, and even his watch, turned into liquid and melted off his body, leaving him completely naked.  As the liquid went down to the floor, it grew and separated into four strips.  Next the liquid solidifies, took shape, and changed to the color of yellow.  Jeff was amazed that all the clothes he wore have turned into a huge banana peel with him in the middle.  But that was only the first minute.  He has only nine minutes to go until his change was complete.  Within moments, Jeff could feel his whole body tingling.  He knew his body was beginning to change.<br />
<br />
Since his changes are going to start on his feet, Jeff looked down to see what happened.  What he saw was truly interesting.  First his toenails began to sink right into his skin along with the little hairs that were above it, leaving each of them completely nailless and hairless.  Then each of his toes drew closer together began to stick, forming into a single appendage for booth feet.  Jeff was in awe by this and tried to wiggle his single appendage but it wasn’t working.  What he didn’t know was that his insides were changing as well, with bones, veins, and muscle squishing and merging together into something edible.  But then Jeff noticed the tips of his single appendage skin turning yellow and the turning all moochy instead of hard.  Jeff just keeps on watching as the changes spread through his feet.  All the hair on them shrank back to his skin as the yellow color spread down to the end of his feet.  Then both feet got closer to each other and merged together, shaping into what appears to point at the bottom.  Strangely enough that the heels of his former feet lifted themselves up and snapped at the bone before the bone dissolved into a delicious substance.  Jeff just couldn’t believe any of it, as his feet were now the bottom part of a banana.<br />
<br />
In the rank of two and a half minutes, he watched on as the changes spread up his legs.  All the hair on them vanishes while the yellow spread upwards.  At the same time, his legs merged together and bended back as his bones and muscles dissolved and changed.  The moment the changes reached his knees, they snapped backwards and were curved from behind.  But for some strange reason, Jeff didn’t feel any pain what so ever.  His guess is that the bones in his body dissolved away so that way he won’t feel any pain.  As least he was glad about that, or he would’ve screamed and his family would hear it.  As the changes went up to his thighs, Jeff felt completely aroused by all of it.  He could feel his dick erecting on his own account.  Without thinking about it, Jeff placed his hand on his penis and stroked it to feel the sexual tension.  He continued doing this for another minute until the changes reached up his waist.  He thought he was going to masturbate but no cum came out of his dick.  He look down at it and noticed that the little hole at the end was sealed up completely.  His guess is that the chances have finally reached to his waist area.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched on as his pubic hair shrank back into his skin, leaving it completely bare.  Then he watched as his privates began to shrivel.  His balls were the first to go as grew small and absorbed right into the skin.  After that, his shaft shrank away, loosing definition and shape to become a small tube.  It too sank right into his skin.  Jeff sighed to himself knowing that he lost his little member for this one time opportunity, but at least it’s going to be for an hour.<br />
<br />
He could also feel something happening to his rear.  If Jeff would’ve turned his back, he could watch as his ass was changing too.  The first thing that happened was his asshole as the opening grew smaller and sealed itself up completely.  Next, his ass cheeks glues together and stitched itself up, making it look like he had no ass at all.  But that didn’t stop there.<br />
<br />
He could feel his waist expanding and bloating, shaping into a cylinder.  Not to mention his skin took on a shade of yellow just like his former legs.  Looking at himself, he could tell that his transformation was half complete.  He knows that he has another five minutes until it’s done.  Quickly, the changes went right up to his stomach.  His treasure trail vanished away along with the hair on his stomach.  He could also saw glimpses of his belly button shrinking away and closing itself off completely.  He could also some strangeness in his body.  He failed to notice that his stomach and digestive track merging and mooshing into the insides of the banana.<br />
<br />
As the transformation went up to his chest area, more changes continued.  In his body, both his lungs and heart were long gone, replaces with the fruit’s innards.  He couldn’t breath nor feels his heartbeat, but for some strange reason, he was still alive.  It’s like the transformation kept him functional until the end.  The little hair on his chest was gone as well while his skin continued to go yellow around that area.  During his change, his back arched back as his spine cracked and soften to the same yellow substance.  The hair on his chest was gone as well at the same time his muscles lost their definition.  Plus his nipples grew smaller and smaller until there were no nipples at all.  His upper body did the same as his lower body as it expands and shaped into a cylinder.  But as it stopped at his chest, Jeff’s arms felt weird.  So he looked at them and noticed them changeling right before his eyes.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was all the little hairs on his arms shrunk back into his skin, leaving him completely bare.  Then, his fingernails were absorbed into his finger, just like his toenails.  Each of his fingers then drew closer together and merged to form one appendage.  Jeff just stared on and was amazed by the hands changing but it wasn’t over yet.  He could feel his arms sinking into his body and his muscles were deteriorating.  His arms were becoming nothing but small stumps.  They continued to get smaller and smaller until the last bits of his stumps become part of the banana.  In seven minutes, his entire body was a banana from the head up.  Turning his neck around to view his entire banana like body, he was amazed on all the details that went through.  Now the only thing left of his is his head.  He could feel the tingling and knows what’s going to happen.<br />
<br />
The change starts off with his neck as it grew and expands while his Adams apple disappears completely.  He tried to say something but his voice box was long gone, meaning he can’t make any noise.  The changes then went right up to his face and could feel each aspect of it.  His mouth got zipped up as his lips flattened and looses its color.  In his mouth, his teeth and tongue were expanding and sealing the mouth permanently.  His nose shrank further into his face and the nostrils closed off, cutting all known oxygen.  But he didn’t need oxygen since his lungs were gone so it was okay for him.  With his nose gone, his eyes were the next to go.  Jeff’s vision was getting blurry, as his eyes grew smaller.  His eye lashes got sucked into his skin and his lids closed up automatically, zipping them like zippers.  Now Jim can’t see, but at least he can still feel the changes.  Just then, the sounds around were getting a little fainter, meaning that his ears are the next things to go.  They grow smaller and smaller as his ear holes shut themselves up.  Once the ears were gone, he couldn’t hear anything neither.  The changes then went up to the top of his head as his hair retracted back into his scalp and left him completely bald.  With all of his features gone, Jeff’s head expanded and rounded into a cylinder while the top part of his head compressed and made a pointed shape.  That’s when his brain starts transforming.  It began to mush around, melt away, and reformed into soft insides as his memories, education, and dreams faded out of existence.  Pretty soon, he had forgotten that his name was in fact Jeff and his life.  All he can think of is that he is a banana, now and forever.<br />
<br />
For eight and a half minutes, what stood was a naked Jeff was now the insides of a banana.  But his changes weren’t complete yet.  After the metamorphosis from human to banana, the peel that use to be Jeff’s clothes lifted themselves up and wrapped around him.  It conceals the banana from bottom to top and zipped on the sides just to keep it tight.  Once it reached the top, the banana was complete.  But the problem was is that it was a big banana and people will notice it very strangely.  That will change in seconds.<br />
<br />
As the banana was complete, it then started to shrink down to the size of the very fruit it is.  When it reaches its height, the stood there until it dropped on the floor and remained there that instant.  Soon the ten minutes were up and lying in the spot that was Jeff was now a banana.  But Jeff didn’t care about it at all.  All he cares about is to become a banana forever.  During that time after his change…</p>
