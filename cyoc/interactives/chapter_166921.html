<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The mervillage began to close around them, there was maybe a few dozen people around them at the moment as her friends began to talk with the others merpeople. Damon and Monica began to explain what happened as an elderly merman swam toward them and began to talk to them. He had been transformed almost 50 years earlier when he and his then girlfriend now late wife had found a child similar to Monica and Damon. He was asking them about the human world and if they had flying cars yet. Tim and Ana where polite but didn’t seam to want to get too friendly with anyone. Chloe was getting more upset and the death glares she was sending to everyone sent everyone away. Slowly she began to kick herself ever so gently away.<br />
“Ah…this is embarrassing but the child we found…we don’t know is it a mermaid or a merman?” inquired Monica as a few people chuckled.<br />
“It’s a girl.” Said another mermaid “You can tell by the shape of the scales, females have a rounder scale while males have a more diamond shaped scales.”<br />
“I see…I guess we didn’t notice that.” Laughed Damon as Chloe got far enough away to slip away from the group. She had watched where Cura had gone and followed her, none of these buildings had window glass, some seamed to have wooden or scrap metal flaps to close off windows but this building had all the windows open. She swam up to one of them and heard Cura speaking to someone else.<br />
“Ah…that is too bad for these people.” Said a male voice “I had hoped we would have found the child before something like this happened.”<br />
“Shall I arrange a living place for them?” said a different female voice<br />
“Well since 3 of them where transformed after the baby had transformed her new parents I was hoping that we could get a royal to come up here and transform them back.” stated Cura <br />
“I see…” said the second female voice as Chloe did a quick look to see an elderly green tailed mermaid with reddish hair which was quickly becoming white, she wore a sea weed top which looked like a tube top but was the most modest thing she had seen a mermaid wear yet. An older man maybe about her father’s age with a deep blue tail and a golden neck chain with what looked to be hundreds of blank keys like one would see in a hardware store around his neck. “I am not sure how the royals will go for that…you know the politics right now with the human world.”<br />
“I do, however these people don’t have anything to do with dumping of human trash in our home and…” started Cura as the merman raised a hand. <br />
“I understand and agree with you, I just don’t know if the royals will go for it.” stated the man “Most of all since we just got word an hour ago about one of our villages being attacked by humans dumping barrels of waste, dozens are dead and some of the more war like royals and political leaders are already talking about a counter strike. None of them will be in much in a mood to help humans. I can put you through if you wish but I already know the answer.”<br />
“I must try.” Said Cura “This isn’t right.”<br />
“Unless the mermaid outside the window wishes to speak to them.” Said the older mermaid as she turned and looked at the window. Cura and the merman turned and looked to see Chloe attempt to pull her head away and get out of sight. <br />
“Come in here, child.” Said the mermaid as Chloe seeing that the game was up let out a sigh and swam up to the window. It was a tight fit but she got through it as well.<br />
“The door is around the back but no matter, I assume you are one of the humans?” inquired the merman<br />
“Yes, I am Chloe and I need to get home…my lover is there and I am playing to ask her to marry me tonight.” Said Chloe as she looked at their faces, she didn’t know if merpeople or mersociety accepted gay marriage but they didn’t seam to blink at the idea of two women together. <br />
“I see…well maybe a personal appeal can help convince the royals.” Stated the mermaid “Like I said I don’t think it will happen but there is a chance.”<br />
“Ok…I can speak to the royals.” stated Chloe as she prepared herself. She had expected maybe something a kin to a phone using old wires to communicate instead a large pearl was brought forth and out of it a holographic image of a seal appeared. The seal was of a large sea turtle with two spears behind it. <br />
“We are going to talk to one of the high families, the Sealina family. They are the most pro-human of the families if they don’t accept you none of them will. The Lord is also second cousins to the current Queen so they have major power at court.” Said Cuva as the image of the seal disappeared as the image of a middle age merman appeared. The image was in gray scale so she couldn’t pick out many colors but he had a full thick beard and hard but not unkind eyes.<br />
“Lord Sealina, I am Cuva of the settlement Binaia.” Announced Cuva as Lord Sealina nodded his head and gave her a small smile. <br />
“Ah…Binaia, I haven’t been there in a long time wonderful place to raise a family I heard but no matter what can I do for you?” inquired Lord Sealina<br />
“Well, today we came across five new merpeople, three mermaids and two merman who had been transformed by a lost merchild.” Explained Cuva as Lord Sealina’s eyes seamed to harden a bit but with some sadness in them still. <br />
“I can see where this is going…” said Lord Sealina as he turned his eyes to Chloe “I assume you are one of these humans correct?”<br />
“I am…and I need to go home.” Stated Chloe as she prepared to make her case.</p>
