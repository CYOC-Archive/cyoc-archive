<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Katie!”<br />
<br />
Katie turned, a smile spreading across her face as saw her teenage parents appear. “Mom, dad, you made it,” she smiled. “And I see you brought, Well everybody.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded turning towards and her friends and Jack. “Well I kind of travel with a big entourage now.”<br />
<br />
As Katie and her mother talked she now began to study everyone who had accompanied her. Gloria had already met Kellie and Jacks friends. It appeared all of the doppelgängers as well as Rexie and Ayami had taken the trip. While she was concerned about the presence of an imp and a succubus she had a feeling they wouldn’t cause too much trouble considering who was with them.<br />
<br />
Gloria had yet to meet Lilith, Circe, Baba Yaga or even the other Merlin. As they now stood before her she felt slightly uneasy. If the stories she had heard were true she was dealing with the mother of demons, a Greek goddess, and a Russian witch of legend.<br />
<br />
“Greetings miss so happy to finally make your acquaintance.”<br />
<br />
Gloria jumped, startled by the mechanical anthro fox that now shook her hand. “Hi,” Gloria said awkwardly before turning towards Katie’s mom. “Is that a robot?”<br />
<br />
“Oh this is Vixi,” Kellie said. “She’s an animatronic and um, Circes ambassador. Oh and this is Bob, he kind of watches me to make sure nothing happens until I give birth.” A large anthro zebra demon now stepped through the crowd, looming over a shocked Gloria. Gloria could feel the blood run out of her face as she stared up at the demon anthro. <br />
<br />
“Mom,” Katie said sternly. “Does your personal demon midwife really need to be freaking out my sister.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Bobs harmless,” Kellie said quickly, causing Katie, Kel, And Gloria to give each other dubious looks. “Okay Mom But I do have a question, how come you don’t look pregnant right now?”<br />
<br />
“Illusion spell,”  Kellie said quickly pointing to her now flat stomach. “It hides my pregnancy. Look I know showing up with everybody is a bit much but I want this to be all about you. Today is you day. Besides have no desire to tell my mom I’m pregnant right now.”<br />
<br />
“Speak of the devil,” Kel smirked as she pointed towards another group of cars pulling up. Gloria watched as the teenage Kellie gulped as Marilyn and Martin O’Toole now exited their vehicle. The elderly woman had a smile on her face as she turned back to see Lisa, Jason and Lynne exit their own vehicles. As she looked towards Katie she waved before motioning towards Lisa. “Martin,” she called. “Be a dear and help Jason with our things. Lisa and I want to talk with Katie.” Martin nodded placing a gentle peck on his wife’s cheek before he and Jason began unloading the car.<br />
<br />
Gloria turned back towards Kellie, seeing the teenager fidget slightly as her mother approached with Kellies sister. “Am I missing something,” Gloria asked. “Why is everyone so freaked out,”<br />
<br />
“Grandma knows a little bit about magic,” Katie said quietly. “She actually met Lilith and Circe before, it wasn’t good.”<br />
<br />
“Couple that with the fact she doesn’t know I’m pregnant and you can see why I’m just a bit nervous,” Kellie muttered. As she anxiously awaited her sister and mother’s arrival she could see the woman study the crowd gathered around curiously. “Katie,” Marilyn smiled, hugging her granddaughter. “You And Kel certainly look stunning. How’s that great granddaughter of mine doing?”<br />
<br />
“Morgan is great grandma,” Katie grinned.<br />
<br />
“We’re pretty sure she’s going to start walking any day now,” Kel added. Marilyn smiled broadly before turning towards her reincarnated daughter. “Kellie What a pleasant surprise,” she said happily. “We weren’t sure if you would be able to make it.”<br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world mom,” Kellie said nervously. “Um, not sure if you remember everyone from my timeline but..l.here they are.” Marilyn now studied the other timelines guests carefully, nodding and whispering as her eyes met the doppelgängers of Katie’s friends. “My goodness they certainly look like your friends Katie.” For a moment Gloria Thought all would be well until Lisa noticed Vixi.<br />
<br />
“Is that a robot?”<br />
<br />
Vixi now stepped forward, the animatronics mouth forming into a perfect smile as she curtsied before Lisa and Marilyn. “Greeting my name is Vixi,” she responded in a bubbly tone. “It is such a pleasure to meet you. My goddess Circe and Lady Lilith are honored to have received an invitation to this wonderful event.” Katie and Gloria now exchanged a troubled look as Marilyn’s eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
“Lilith,” she said in alarm, turning towards the sandy haired woman in front of her. “I remember you. You were that woman in the forest, the one that threatened my family.”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit,” Katie, Kellie, And Gloria muttered as they buried their faces in their hands. Lilith now stood tall as she stared eye to eye with the elderly woman, neither one wanting to give an inch. “Yes it is I,” Lilith stated. “When we first met woman I was a different person. I wished to destroy your daughter, granddaughter, and great granddaughter. Now though we have reached an understanding.”<br />
<br />
“I most certainly hope so,” Marilyn grumbled. “You most certainly won’t be hurting any of my family while I’m around.” Lilith scoffed at the idea of this elderly woman offering much resistance to her power if she so choose to use it. “Is something funny,” Marilyn asked raising an eyebrow as she now stood nose to nose with Lilith.<br />
<br />
“If I so choose woman I could destroy you with a flick of my wrist,” Lilith stated with a smile.<br />
<br />
“But you won’t will you,” Marilyn growled, her eyes narrowing as she stared directly into Liliths eyes. The smile on Liliths face now faded as she stared directly into Marilyn O’Tooles eyes. The nerve of this woman, standing before a demon like this. Lilith knew this woman had no magic of her own, she was merely an imposing pretense to mortals. As the two continued to glare at one another though Lilith began to understand something, Marilyn may have no power of her own but her will power was impressive. <br />
<br />
“Now I see why your daughters respect and fear you,” Lilith smirked. “You will is unbreakable. You command respect. Perhaps you and I are not so different after all.”<br />
<br />
The entire group had held their collective breath as Marilyn and Lilith faced off against one another. The last thing anyone wished to see was Lilith unleash her violent tendencies against any of the bridal party. “My apologies for earlier,” Lilith said. “I wish no harm on any of your family. I understand what it is like to hold those your care for above your own needs. Perhaps we can continue this conversation over a cup of tea?”<br />
<br />
Katie, Gloria, Kellie and Lisa gawked at the demon witch as she extended a hand towards Marilyn O’Toole. The elderly woman at first gave the demon a bemused look before a small smile cracked across her lips. “Tea sounds lovely,” Marilyn smiled. “Come on then, I can show you pictures of Morgan. My great granddaughter is quite the beauty.”<br />
<br />
As the two now walked off the others sat in stunned silence, still trying to comprehend what they had just seen. “Did Grandma aNd Lilith just become friends,” Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
“I think so,” Katie said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
“Figures mom and the mother of demons would have a lot in common,” Lisa chuckled as she looked at her sister. The teenage Kellie could only give her sister a short laugh as she watched Lilith and her mother enter the hotel. “Ann is never going to believe this.”<br />
<br />
Gloria could only shake her head as Lilith and her grandmother vanished from sight. They had only just arrived and things were already weird.</p>
