<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I am not totally sure about this.” admitted Atargatis as she stood before a large mirror in the workshop of the human fashion designer who had just made her outfit. <br />
<br />
“You look amazing.” Stated Astaroth as she stood beside her. <br />
<br />
“You look great mom.” Confirmed Rachel as Atargatis looked at herself again. The cloths she had one would have gotten her beaten by her former husband but here in hell they were downright modest. A black leather corset around her stomach pushed up her now much larger breasts, while under it two pieces of green fabric the same color as her scales moved up and wrapped around her neck showing off a lot of her cleavage. She had to keep her back fully uncovered because of her pairs of wings, one upper, one lower. Her dress was long going down to almost the ground and was the same green color but had two very high splits so when she walked the dress acted more like two loss pieces of fabric flapping between her legs. Large knee-high boots made of green and black leather were on her human-like feet. <br />
<br />
“I do.” Confirmed Atargatis as she struck a sexy position leaning toward the mirror so that she could look down her front to see her cleavage all the while blowing a kiss at the mirror While from behind Astaroth had to fight the urge to take her future wife from behind then and there.  <br />
<br />
“One thing.” Said Astaroth as she took off some of her own jewelry and gave it to Atargatis before finally putting on the red necklace that she had given her so long ago as a human around her neck. “Now you are ready to go out and see hell.”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t even seen that much of hell yet.” Stated Rachel<br />
<br />
“Well let my Aunt and I be you two tour guides to the underworld.” Offered Maisy as suddenly multiple demons entered the chamber.<br />
<br />
“What is the meaning of this?” inquired Ataroth as the Princess of the 8th circle glared at the guards. She could see from the armor they wore that these were royal guards. Each of the rulers of hell had their own personal guard, and the personal guard of Lucifer where the best of the best. <br />
<br />
“Princess Ataroth forgive us for interrupting, but we have been ordered to protect you.” Stated the Captain of this guard force as Ataroth glared at her. “All four of you that is, we have reasons to believe Rev. Church and a small force of Iron Knights have made it to hell.”<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Atargatis as she shivered a bit remembering all the beatings, she had gotten from her ex husband in the past. <br />
<br />
“Yes, we eliminated most of the Iron Knights but the local chapter managed to escape and according to General Baal while investigating their local hide out that they managed to open a portal to hell.” Stated the Captain. “General Baal even believes that they somehow managed to transport themselves to the 5th circle.”<br />
<br />
“That far?” inquired Atargatis “That has never happened in history, not even heaven ever opened a portal to the 5th circle. Is he sure?”<br />
<br />
“I do not question the general my Princess.” stated the Captain of the Guard.<br />
<br />
“Baal is rarely wrong.” stated Ataroth “Alright, until we get them, you are to protect these three with your lives.”<br />
<br />
“Princess what about…” started the Captain of the guards as Ataroth extender her hand as a wicked looking Sabre appeared in her hands. She put it on her belt. <br />
<br />
“I am staying with them.” stated Ataroth as she held out her hand as a small portal opened up. The image of a rather handsome red skinned man wearing black leather armor appeared. He bowed his head to show that coming off his bald head was a line of spikes which ran down his back. “Captain assembly the best of my personal guard and bring them to my location at once, there is a threat to my niece and my new wife.”<br />
<br />
The guard’s eyes widened at the news that his Princess had taken a wife after being unmarried for so long. <br />
<br />
“At once.” Confirmed the guard, what more could be said. <br />
<br />
Far away from the 9th circle of hell, Josh or now legally called Thoth was trying on some new cloths of his own. The number of changes he needed made to “normal” clothing was limited because angels were in general far more human then demons. <br />
<br />
“I kind of like this.” said Josh as he showed Penumune the clothes the tailor had made for him. <br />
<br />
He wore a kind of brown leather vest which had multiple pockets in it with a black undershirt. He had on a brown set of work pants with extra padding on the knees and a pair of boots. With his glasses, the only thing he was missing was a hat and he looked like a grad student going out to an archaeological dig of some kind. <br />
<br />
Penumune chuckled a bit. <br />
<br />
“I do like the vest and shirt, not sure about the pants or boots, not much reasons for boots in a library.” explained Penumune “But who am I to judge, I wear glasses and I don’t have to, you be you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” explained Josh “So what now? Do I go meet your parents or do we go back to your place?”<br />
<br />
“Well, that is where I come in.” said a new voice as Remeila stood in the doorway of the room. “I understand from my sister, that you want to see what your mother and sister has become. Luckily for you, as the ruler of purgatory I am one of the few who have access to the highest levels of heaven and the lowest levels of hell.”<br />
<br />
“It would be nice to see my mom and sister to know they are ok.” Admitted Josh “are angels allowed to go to Hell?”<br />
<br />
“Not normally.” Admitted Remeila “And more so the 9th circle where we are going.”<br />
<br />
“I have been meaning to ask, the circles of hell that is like in Dante?” inquired Josh <br />
<br />
“Dante got a few things wrong, but considering his source that isn’t unexpected.” Stated Penumune <br />
<br />
“What was his source?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say, one of our sisters was having an affair with him for a while and she talks in her sleep.” laughed Remeila before she got more serios “Since I will be transporting two others Angels I can’t go right there, I have to go through some checkpoints.”<br />
<br />
“Understand.” Said Josh as Penumune gave her sister a slight nerve look. Like most angels she had never been to hell, yet alone to the 9th circle where the most powerful demons call home. She had hardly left the Archives outside of going to the Palace to record meetings and her time down on Earth. Going to Hell was out of the ordinary. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile in hell, Dr. Bashir moved toward where he was told he would find his “friend’s” daughter. He had volunteered to make contact with this former member of the human race to gain her friendship and trust. <br />
<br />
That was the role he had promised that demon whore Lady Cruciata that that was the role he and his fellow members of the Iron Knights would play. However he knew just like the other members of the Iron Knights that they were going to end up dead and that the Carrionfly would kill them after they carried out the death of Rev. Church turned wife and daughter. <br />
<br />
If there was one thing true about demons, besides them being abomination against God himself and all who stood on his side was that they looked down on humans. They considered humans nothing more than animals they could use for their pleasure. Lady Cruciata’s and her father had proven that by showing them how they treated that human girl they corrupted to make into the sexual play thing of the so called “lady” Cruciata. <br />
<br />
Demons being as high and mighty as they believed themselves to be, couldn’t even comprehended that the humans they find so far below them could possibly betray them. <br />
<br />
It had taken all the effort of him and his fellow knights to convince Rev Church to not waste this chance. Getting revenge on his corrupted daughter and wife was totally understandable and righteous. The fact that his wife and daughter were both corrupted would bring great shame to the Rev. in the grand history book of the order. It was nearly unforgivable and punishable by death or exile from the order. However, the fact that Lady Cruciata wanted Rev. Church’s daughter dead gave them the chance to write their names forever in the greatest event in the history of the order or possibly the history of world.<br />
<br />
So for the moment they would play the part the Carrionflys believed that the humans would play but in time they would do what they really came to do.<br />
<br />
The assassination of the Devil himself.</p>
