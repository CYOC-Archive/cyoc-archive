<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave was sitting at his desk typing up a business report after finishing a late lunch. The day had been like any other except for the fact that he had been promoted out of the blue for his exemplary performance the last few weeks and given his own office and secretary. Smiling to himself at the memory of the whirlwind of a morning he had been through. Congratulated heartily by his boss Joe and then being let in to his new spacious office followed by later the arrival of his new, young and very sexy brunette secretary Janet. Janet was quite nervous in being introduced to him but he did his best to make her feel welcome. Chuckling at the memory Dave typed quickly as it was already almost 2:00 and he really wanted to finish early today in order to surprise his wife with the wonderful news. Only Dave knew what was more surprising at that moment either him finishing the report right as the clock on his computer struck 2:00PM or the fact that as soon as he finished the report with a typed period he lost all feeling in his body and his vision went dark.<br />
<br />
Dave came to in a much different place for as soon as his vision went dark it soon returned a second later with the return of feeling in his body. Dave wasn’t sitting in his office chair anymore in fact for some reason he was kneeling on the ground with his legs jutting open. Nothing felt or looked right not only from the long brown hair hanging down over his vision but also his body weight was off balance and he felt like he was wearing almost nothing. Dave didn’t get long to figure what was going on as a sudden burst of the most incredible feeling of sexual pressure hit his groin and sent him forward onto his hands grasping the floor as a screaming moan unintentionally escaped his lips, a scream that sounded very feminine. Continuing to unintentionally moan as well as huffing and puffing from the incredible feelings. You open your eyes again to see a very frightening sight, “I have breasts!” you scream as another wave of pressure to your groin sends you leaning into your shaking arms as another orgasm hits from the realization of the existence of your breasts. Coming to once again you look over the rest of your body and its no surprise that your rocked by two very powerful orgasms back to back as you find that not only you are a full woman but that you are sporting nothing on except a tight orange thong bikini.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly you don’t fall onto your stomach during the powerfully orgasmic explosions your quivering  arms hold you up during your bliss, your body automatically keeping your kneeling legs spread wide open and your back arched forward with your barely contained breasts full front and center. Recovering your inhibitions after some heavy breathing you know you have to find out whats going on. Leaning back off your hands you look up and see a sight that makes you do a double take. A twin of you is up there at your desk staring lustfully down at you in this form. With your quivering lips you still shout out in obvious distress “oh my god! What’s go go going on here! That voice you notice sounds very familiar. Looking around the room in obvious fright as your position finally hits home you now you have to get out of here and try to stand up to run out of the room but your legs refuse to respond in fact as you try to close your legs and lift them off the ground as well as push with your dainty arms your body seems to do the opposite as it holds itself to the ground spreads your legs to the fullest and holds your leaning arching back in place harder with your heaving breasts pushed out as much as possible. Being alarmed at how your body is acting as you fight against it immediately sends another orgasm throughout your system as this one is felt all over. Along with the all-body orgasm your mind is flooded with all kinds of disgusting sexual images of how a woman can please a man. All these thoughts came into your mind against your will and you fight against them being there but even as you try and forget them a part of you that you never knew existed wants to look at them and likes what it is seeing. This tug-of-war with part of your mind liking what it see is all it takes as the most powerful orgasm you ever had in this form throws your head back and causes your whole body to violently shake.<br />
<br />
“Da Davveeee di did you do this?” you moan after catching your breath but become dumbfounded after you realized that you called this clone in front of you “Dave.” Why can’t I call him something different? You realize in horror as you try multiple different times to call this impostor something else but it always comes out as “Dave.” “Please Dave, its me Janet” you moan but again your dumbfounded and at a loss for words as why you called yourself Janet unless? The long brunette hair, the body-type, the familiar voice it all came to you in one slap in the face “I’m Janet!” you scream out in terror as at that moment another wave of sexual images and a powerful orgasm hit your body and mind and causes you to lunge forward in multiple thrusting motions. Knowing you can’t take this much longer you don’t know whats gonna come next as at this point your bikini bottoms are soaking wet. “Yes of course your Janet who else would you be?” said the new Dave from his chair with a leering smile. At the verge of tears both from the orgasms and from the emotions from your female body you cry out “Pl Please Dave, did yo, yo, you do this? Pleeease ch, ch, change me baaack!” Pleading with your eyes as your sexy body got back into its firm erotic pose the new Dave smiled evilly and stared down at you. “No Janet I didn’t turn you into a sex slave girl you already were one. Trained at a special academy with all the trimmings to make any man or woman happy for the rest of their lives. Janet you can’t escape your training and fighting that body and that mind will just make you more horny and agreeable to service your master which is me by the way, you really should know this already.” At that moment the new Janet knew as if it was imprinted in her brain “yes Master picked me out at the academy and purchased me to be his secretary and slave.”<br />
<br />
Everything made sense to Janet about who she was but she still fought as she knew that wasn’t who she always had been. Fighting against her training and memories brought on another orgasm that scrambled her mind further and Janet knew that she needed to stop them from occurring so rapidly in order to think things through including a way to escape. Smiling down at her from his chair Dave started to undo his pants button and zipper and soon let his penis fall out of his pants. Janet at any other time in her life would have been revolted but her training dictated that she be mesmerized and sexually thrilled at the sight and with her decision not to fight herself anymore that’s exactly how Janet truly felt as she waited on command for her Master to say the words. “Janet why don’t you come suck me off” was all she needed as she lunged forward and shoved his erect shaft into her waiting mouth. Licking and sucking were like second nature to her as she eagerly worked away. With her own orgasm close to bursting Dave blew a huge load into her mouth in a earth shattering orgasm that was only surpassed by Janet’s orgasm immediately at the same time as she hungrily swallowed the warm fluid which had the taste of sweet nectar.</p>
