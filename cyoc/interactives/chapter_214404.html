<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From behind her back, Karen produced a little pinky chastity cage. For a moment, Dylan didn&#39;t know what he was looking at, he was caught up in the moment and just started walking toward her bed, hungry for her body. But then, everything started to click and the little object she was holding in her hands became to come together clearly in his mind. &quot;Is that... for me?&quot; was all Dylan could say.<br />
<br />
Karen nodded with a sly smile. Dylan felt crushed - it had been a prank all along, he should have known. From the beginning his sister was fucking with him, this morning was no accident. Hell, she probably still had that damn coin hidden away somewhere. Dylan knew he should be angry, but with all the feelings he had developed for Karen - tears were welling in his eyes. He turned away. Karen quickly got up from the bed and put her arms around him. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked with sincerity. &quot;You&#39;re fucking with me. I knew it&quot;. Dylan said, and tried to pull away. Somehow he wasn&#39;t strong enough to break away from Karen&#39;s embrace, that was strange. &quot;I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not fucking with you. I promise.&quot; Karen pleaded. &quot;Look, I actually really liked this morning. I didn&#39;t expect to like it this much. I know this is crazy and new and neither of us really know what&#39;s going on right now, but I do like you and I want to see where this goes.&quot; Dylan turned to look at Karen, there was no mocking look on her face or note in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;But then, why that?&quot; Dylan meant the chastity cage. A smile reappeared on Karen&#39;s face. &quot;Well...&quot; she began, &quot;after this morning, I wondered if maybe you weren&#39;t ready for sex yet&quot;. Dylan looked away in slight annoyance. &quot;No, please listen&quot; Karen continued, &quot;I know you will be, and I want to be your first. But, I think you just need a little practice holding it in. This will help&quot;. She shook the cage in her hand, the key that was attached to it by a little ring jingled slightly. &quot;Trust me&quot;, she kissed Dylan, and he kissed her back. Maybe she was right, maybe this wasn&#39;t such a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Together on the bed, they fit Dylan&#39;s little penis into the cage. It was an easy fit, even with Dylan being hard. Truth be told, Dylan almost couldn&#39;t help himself when she had grasped his little member between her thumb and forefinger to guide it in, but he had kept himself together. And now, it was safe from any touch behind a little metal cage. Karen gave the cage a little jiggle, it was roomy. &quot;Maybe a bit big, it was the smallest I could get on short notice...&quot; she said thoughtfully, unaware of the little painful sting the remark gave Dylan. &quot;Maybe we could custom order a smaller one&quot; she said more to herself than Dylan. Karen put the tiny metal key on an anklet and put the anklet on. &quot;For safekeeping&quot;, she smiled at Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;So&quot; Dylan said a little unsure of himself, &quot;what happens now?&quot;. &quot;Now is the fun part&quot; Karen&#39;s mischievous side had kicked in again. &quot;Now we test you&quot;, and with this Karen stood up on the bed and slid down her panties. Her vagina was smooth and fresh, she must have shaved while he was out during the day. She drew herself close to his face, until his nose was touching her skin. &quot;I believe Cindy taught you a thing or two about what to do, right? After this morning I think you owe me an orgasm too. And remember - we&#39;re testing you&#39;re endurance, I&#39;ll be checking that little cage of yours for any messes when you&#39;re done&quot;. She was teasing him, but he didn&#39;t care. She was right, he knew what to do now, and with the instruction from Cindy fresh in his mind he got to work with his tongue.<br />
<br />
The whole practice reminded him of Cindy. Sometimes Cindy&#39;s instructions sounded in his mind, sometimes it was her teasing. &quot;Oh, yes, it&#39;s so much bigger than your cock!&quot; - that&#39;s what Cindy had said about his tongue. There was a bit of tension as Dylan expected the same treatment from Karen, but the teasing never came. Karen seemed to be genuinely enjoying this, from the moment he started, her still standing on the bed and looking down on him, she had been soaking wet. Something about all of this was turning her on, and her being this turned on turned Dylan on in turn. It didn&#39;t hurt to have an erection in his new cage, but instead of the soft silk panties, his little penis was now pressed against cold metal. At this point, Karen was now lying on the bed, and Dylan lay beneath her with his face buried between her legs. She was gyrating on his face making small noises here and there, every so often a little jolt from her pelvis. Finally, the climax - it was more intense than Cindy&#39;s, who simply shook slightly then ordered him to begin again. Karen&#39;s entire body shuddered, a gasp escaped from her mouth, and then she lay in blissful silence for a moment or two, holding Dylan&#39;s head right here it was as she collected herself again.<br />
<br />
Finally she broke the silence. &quot;Now&quot;, she said, assuming gentle control again. &quot;Let&#39;s make sure you didn&#39;t have any accidents.&quot; Together they checked Dylan&#39;s cage. His little penis was hard, throbbing, leaking precum, but he had kept control. Dylan couldn&#39;t help but feeling proud, and Karen shared in his pride. &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you&quot; she said, and kissed him on his lips still wet from tonguing her. &quot;I think I&#39;m ready&quot;, Dylan said, breaking the kiss &quot;Can we try doing it now?&quot;. &quot;Awh, I know you feel like you&#39;re ready, but I don&#39;t think you are yet. Just hang on and wear the cage a little bit longer, okay? For me?&quot; Dylan was surprised, he thought the cage was just to test his endurance. &quot;You mean, continue wearing the cage through the day?&quot;. Karen replied &quot;Yes, it has to be full time. At least for now. That&#39;s how you build your endurance back. Look, you may never get your size back, but that&#39;s not even the issue. You have to be able to last a long time, that&#39;s the real problem here.&quot; When she put it like that, it made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I at least have my underwear back?&quot; Karen had forgotten her little prank. &quot;Oops! Yes, of course you can&quot; she replied. She went up and pulled all of Dylan&#39;s underwear out of his drawer. He was relieved, and he pulled the first pair back on over his waist. The boxers would not stay up by themselves and slid right back down. Karen was just as surprised as Dylan, &quot;Maybe you&#39;ve lost weight?&quot; she suggested, &quot;or maybe your dick was all that was keeping it up before?&quot; she teased. Dylan tried another pair, and then another, but none of them would stay up. Karen went back to her drawer and came back with another pair of panties. &quot;Just for now&quot; she said, then kissed Dylan on the cheek. Dylan put on the fresh pair of panties, and they fit like a glove.<br />
<br />
Dylan left the room and Karen was left alone. Her heart was racing, everything had gone off just as she pictured. He had Dylan wrapped around her little finger, he even agreed to wear the cage full time - she didn&#39;t expect that. She was excited, thrilled, a whole new world had opened up in their relationship, and she had more ideas. The next few weeks were going to be fun.</p>
