<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Curve-ball! This would introduce quite a lot of drama between them.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes please, Master.&quot; Spot requested with a slight hesitance to his request. He was indeed enjoying being a dog, being told what to do. But there was a part of him that felt indignant about this.<br />
<br />
John audibly sighed as he motioned with his hand the order to lie down. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s get this over with then.&quot; <br />
<br />
Spot was more than happy to follow the order, showing his belly over to his Master and wagging his tail, joy unbound in his heart to do this. He then shook his head, and looked expectantly to John. <br />
<br />
Honestly, this had been insane. John essentially forced him into this form and then fucked with his mind using magic to make him an obedient dog! He wanted to be a werewolf!<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, one unzipping coming right up, good boy so far.&quot; John kneeled besides Spot, a robed hand reaching down and giving the Australian Shepherd a quick belly rub that made Spot feel so good!<br />
<br />
Such a fun time being such a good boy! Spot felt the hand clasp his zipper and he barely managed to suppress a whine of displeasure at wanting to go back to his human form. Why was a part of him so upset at this?<br />
<br />
In his mind, Scott was increasingly agitated at this fake part of him that was so happy to become a dog. He didn&#39;t want this kind of obedience to his friend of all people. He had a job to go back to after Halloween for fuck&#39;s sake!<br />
<br />
&quot;And... we go.&quot; The zipper flew down his body terrifyingly splitting apart his chest, though surprisingly inside was his own human chest. His arms began to bloat with mass once the zipper was down, he could feel his body returning to humanoid shape while within the suit.<br />
<br />
Soon, his eyes sunk into his sockets as his real eyes separated from the suit, his arms straightening from the digitigrade stance of the dog. His body enlarged inside the faux real fur as he could feel the modifications, the feeling of his control over his tail diminish and completely cut off.<br />
<br />
With a tug of the head, the head of Spot detached and Scott took a deep relieved breath as if he was drowning in the dog head, throwing the costume headpiece to the floor. <br />
<br />
Hurriedly once the compulsion was gone, Scott began to take off the rest of the costume and dropping it in a messy pile. He was hasty in the whole procedure now that he had fingers again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking hell...&quot; Scott whispered under his breath, taking deep calming breaths. John heard Scott say something and cheerily asked, &quot;So, my costumes are magical and it&#39;s fun isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... yeah...&quot; Once the obedience was fading away with the costume, Scott could finally think for himself once more. He was... rightfully pissed off. There was a compulsion with the collar and once John took that off, Scott turned around.<br />
<br />
In a rapid swing, his fist squarely met John in his face&#39;s left side, sending the robed man onto the floor stunned from disbelief and pain. <br />
<br />
&quot;So... did you like getting something you didn&#39;t want?&quot; Scott asked, breathing heavily from the first fist he launched against his best friend in years.<br />
<br />
John was on the floor clutching his bruising face, the blow serious and angry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, what possessed you to think I&#39;d enjoy being a helpless guard dog stuck at your whims and orders?&quot; Scott rubbed his fist and shook off the pain, angrily glaring at John now looking up in disbelief at the fact that he was punched. &quot;You fucking ordered me to enjoy the damn experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott walked forwards and crouched to be on eye level with John. His face was serious, no mercy present in his smoldering eyes. &quot;Got so high on that magic that my free will didn&#39;t matter?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I made sure you&#39;d enjoy it.&quot; John talked, the weird chipper from before missing from his voice. &quot;I thought it&#39;s what you wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott growled low in his throat, remnants of the suit&#39;s instincts fading away quickly. &quot;Well you thought wrong. You basically raped my mind  bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
John could only look to the floor, recounting the words he so joyfully said to his best friend as orders.<br />
<br />
<i>Down.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Settle.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Enjoy being a dog.</i><br />
<br />
Fuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take that fucking robe off, it&#39;s messing with your mind.&quot; Scott said as an order, this time being the polar opposite of what John had just been. Cold, oppressive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I was just trying to sell you the idea, relax man.&quot; John wiped off the blood from his nose onto his robes, it disappearing just as magically fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take the fucking robes off, and don&#39;t try to magic me into some shit.&quot; Scott demanded with no room for negotiation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, one second. I can recommend you the werewolf cost-&quot; John started up, but Scott&#39;s increasingly angrier face was more like the werewolf already.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine fine!&quot; John disrobed just as quickly, a feeling of not wanting to lingering as he hesitated to pull it off. But with one glance at his friend he took it off, hanged it over his arm and splayed himself to Scott. &quot;Happy?&quot; <br />
<br />
Scott waited and appraised his friend. &quot;Try being all sales wizard again.&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you can buy... that lion costume and be king!&quot; John advertised the nearby lion costume in the bag, and found his mind blank of the usual quick solutions.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was horrible.&quot; Scott said just as John finished the spiel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; John replied back. &quot;That was very bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you&#39;re John my friend again, not that weird ass sales wizard that tried to force me into becoming a real dog.&quot; Scott sighed as he looked over the entire set of costumes around them, the magic in them so dangerous. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you punched me...&quot; John rubbed his swollen face. The punch was dead serious. It had been almost two years since they ever got into a fight. John and Scott was best friends through thick and thin, and, in hindsight, John had overstepped boundaries.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, you were forcing me to become a dog, which I don&#39;t want, but then you ordered me to fucking like it?&quot; Scott&#39;s voice was showing how much displeasure was brewing inside. &quot;Very much rape-y man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, thinking it back I was just feeling all jolly and happy that I wanted to just sell the dog idea to you.&quot; John&#39;s eyes widened as he realized that yes, he did just try to force his friend to become a dog and like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gonna wear that robe again? You pretty much made me weary about the werewolf costume.&quot; Scott asked as he bent down to pick up the high quality werewolf suit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; John was sure the werewolf one was dangerous, but he couldn&#39;t know more now.</p>
