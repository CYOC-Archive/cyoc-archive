<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad&#39;s date with Amy was a bit after Ryan and Connor&#39;s date started, and that gave him some time to get ready. And despite all the stuff that had been going around regarding the reveal and the various pushes back and forth, Tad had been looking forward to it. A long weekend gave him the perfect window be with Amy more and have more fun than he would otherwise. He might still have his own curfew with his mother, whom he wouldn&#39;t go against. Sure he was eighteen and a legal adult, but other events were things that more than enough to keep concern over. And that sort of thing made some degree of sense, and Tad had no desire to put Amy in danger.<br />
<br />
Sure, Amy could probably handle herself well. Like him, she was a werewolf, and a beautiful one at that. Her fursona&#39;s white fur contrasted with his his own&#39;s black fur. Tad privately thought how the two of them together would come off as a yin and yang symbol based on how their werewolf forms looked. But because she was already a were, unless there were rogue roaming tigers or brown bears lose in their part of Washington, which was unlikely, it was unlikely that local wildlife would be a threat to her and with Tad, most weres, regardless of which side of the reveal debate they were on, probably wouldn&#39;t be too eager about picking a fight. That gave Tad a fair amount of confidence, but he&#39;d also been raised to be respectful and try to keep things appropriate to the situation.<br />
<br />
True, most of his the lessons his father and mother had given him growing up were more in line with dating a normal human girl and trying to avoid areas that could be dangerous due to other things. Many of the places Tad had seen while growing up weren&#39;t too bad, but that didn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t have their darker areas or places where crime could occur. That meant that avoiding those areas made any sort of dating a necessity. Certain things about Moon Lake were different, but it still made sense to try and stick with that mentality. It wouldn&#39;t matter how capable Amy was... running into a fight or a riot wouldn&#39;t make for a good date.<br />
<br />
But for the moment there was a lot to do. Leaving Jen and Claire to discuss their day more or what they would plan for dinner, Tad moved to head up to the second floor of the Decker home. He had the time to get ready, but that didn&#39;t mean he could waste it not getting ready. He made his way up and into his room before tossing his backpack down on the bed. He had some homework to work on, but with the long weekend, there would be plenty of time to work with that. Right now getting things ready for his night with Amy was the big thing, and that would mean readying what he would wear and ultimately taking a shower. As he didn&#39;t want to smell bad on what was supposed to be a romantic evening...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you shower already?&quot; Jay complained to Amy as she moved between her bedroom and the shower that was there for the Howler children when she ran into her brothers Jay and Leon who were coming out from their own bedroom and initially looked like they were headed downstairs. Finding their older sister wearing only a bathrobe was enough to get them curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a quick one before school,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;and I had to give you two time to shower as well... This is to get ready for a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grah!&quot; Leon stuck out his tongue making a mocking sound of disgust at that, making Amy roll her eyes a bit.<br />
<br />
She knew her brothers were old enough now that the whole &quot;girls are icky&quot; thing was likely to be dying away. The fact that they had also had their first transformations, a year early like her own first transformation was, would add to that. A part of her was fairly certain that her brothers would begin to take real interest in some of their classmates as they began to mature more too. It wouldn&#39;t be too long from there before many of the things that weres in Moon Lake were known for followed. And the smile Amy gave her brothers reflected that sort of knowledge and with the fact that she also knew that Jay and Leon liked Tad.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I thought you liked Tad,&quot; Amy told them, &quot;he and his mom helped you two when it came to your first transformations and being ready for them...&quot; Amy then added silently to herself, &quot;and pretty much getting through them with crippling pain or sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s okay,&quot; Leon gave a nonchalant wave to it and Jay nodded in agreement beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean we want to date him,&quot; Jay added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would hope so... he is mine,&quot; Amy smiled and then just walked into the bathroom and shut the door behind her.<br />
<br />
As the door shut she reached over to the middle switch on the wall to turn on the exhaust fan before removing her robe and hanging it on one of the hooks behind the door. To some extent, wearing the robe wasn&#39;t super necessary as given that werewolves were among the larger weres and would have to disrobe before assuming their werewolf form, it was not as though Jay and Leon hadn&#39;t seen her naked before. But Amy put that as a difference between her were form and her human form, which she was presently in. In her fursona, unless the clothes were specially made to fit, she wouldn&#39;t fit into her normal clothes and thus nudity was something she couldn&#39;t avoid. And the same would be true for Jay and Leon... or really any werewolf in Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
Being naked in front of her brothers in her human form was different and with her intent to get ready for her date, showing and doing it well was a must. She didn&#39;t plan on anything fancy, as they would only start with a trip to the movies and then catching what would likely be leftovers from either Tad&#39;s house or her family&#39;s before going off for some time in the woods... assuming that none of the various groups squabbling over the reveal weren&#39;t out and about causing trouble. And being with Tad was something that Amy had greatly enjoyed and looked forward to. Sure he wasn&#39;t fully aware of all of Moon Lake&#39;s ins and outs when he first arrived, but he was kind and helpful. It made his character something that Amy liked more than just his muscles or his equipment. He&#39;d helped her family greatly already in helping coach Jay and Leon through their first transformation, and the more they&#39;d gotten to know each other... the more that Amy had the idea that Tad was the one she&#39;d want to marry... And those where her thoughts as she stepped into the tub and closed the shower blind and then turning on the water...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Showering didn&#39;t take too much time for Tad and his mom and Claire didn&#39;t interfere too much in his date preparations as he went through them. He put on some deodorant after drying off and then ducked quickly back into his room to further get ready. And there he found his clothes ready and waiting. It included a clean pair of jeans and polo shirt. It wasn&#39;t the fanciest of things, but Moon Lake had no &quot;high end&quot; restaurant that might have a higher dress code and from what Tad had found out about Moon Lake was that a lot of were&#39;s dates often got hot and heavy without much real provocation. And in some cases this was even done in the woods in the outer areas of town, where the thick trees could obscure the view of anyone from the houses or the streets as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I wouldn&#39;t want to risk losing or damaging anything that would be super fancy or expensive,&quot; Tad thought to himself as he glanced to his closet. He had some standard suits, jackets, and ties, but most of these had been things for when his father had some formal ceremony to attend to and he and his mom were allowed to come along. They fit and looked good on him, but Tad also knew that Moon Lake was a different place and that they might only be needed if the date was to go into Seattle and see some of the sights there or for a more formal occasion, like a wedding. That thought soon let something else creep into his own mind... &quot;I wonder if mom would be alright with Amy coming to the wedding for her and Claire too... but that will be something for later.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced to the clock as he began to dress himself for the date and saw that there was still a fair amount of time before he&#39;d need to go out and meet with Amy. That let him relax a little as he pulled on his shirt and then moving pull his pants up so that his shirt would be easily tucked in. This included making sure there were no wrinkles that would stand out. From there it was easy to collect his socks and put on a pair of shoes. They weren&#39;t the tennis shoes he normally wore to school and probably wouldn&#39;t be super great for wandering around in the woods if things went that far for himself and Amy, but they were clean and didn&#39;t quite smell as much as the shoes he normally wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;There... almost fully ready,&quot; Tad said as he brushed himself off, &quot;just one more thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
From here he turned to his desk and opened one of the lower drawers on its left side and pulled out a modest wallet and an accompanying box that was beside it in the space. Like most people his age, he&#39;d grown up with a steady allowance for doing certain chores. They weren&#39;t too much... keeping his room clean, helping with the garbage, and some vacuuming from time to time fit into these sorts of things. He&#39;d also had his fair share of summer jobs too, most them ended up involving cutting lawns during the summer. It wasn&#39;t much ad Tad never made more than a couple of cents over minimum wage, but it was enough that he could save for certain things and a movie could be one of those things.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t fully sure on how much the movie would cost, but a part of him figured could be fairly pricey, given the limitations that his mom had told him that Moon Lake&#39;s small theater had. Though, Tad wasn&#39;t sure on that. As most of his dates with Amy had been more in relation to doing things that might be more typical to were meetings and exploring the woods and that would mean what would be a &quot;normal&quot; date was not something he was fully familiar with. For all Tad knew the theater might actually have competitive prices in order to attract people to come to the theater, regardless of its size. Thus he set his wallet down on the bed and then placed the box next to it. He opened the box to find the box carefully sorted so that all the bills he had were organized between ones, fives, tens, and twenties and each section as helped along by a wooden partition built into the box. In theory there was also room for change, but Tad generally didn&#39;t get too picky on that and more often not loose change ended up in a proverbial piggy bank. He selected out three twenties and a ten and then placed the box back in his desk. As he finished organizing how he would pay for the date, Tad enjoyed a moment of rest before eventually getting and preparing to walk Amy to the theater...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Getting dressed was easy as much like Tad, Amy had gone for something comfortable and simple. If it were summer and a dinner date exclusively, Amy might have considered an actual dress, and she had some numbers that she was sure would get Tad&#39;s attention. But with winter on its way and the drops in the temperature a bit more visible... the last thing Amy wanted was a clothing choice that would ultimately leave her open to a chill. Being a were, the cold didn&#39;t bother her much, but that didn&#39;t mean she wanted to feel chilly.<br />
<br />
She came down the stairs to find Jay and Leon watching television with their father. The show was pretty simple and didn&#39;t really hold Amy&#39;s attention, but she would need to do something while waiting for Tad to arrive. Her father looked up as Amy came into the living room and gave a small smile. Amy could also hear her mother, Elizabeth, working on something in the kitchen, likely the night&#39;s dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t a fancy date, I take it?&quot; her father, Gary, said with a bit of humor in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a movie for right now...&quot; Amy answered, &quot;what comes next... that&#39;s for whether or not the movie is good and no one causes trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got her father to look up to her with some look of concern in his eyes. That made Amy give a slight sigh as she turned to face him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be careful, right?&quot; Gary asked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... and I&#39;ll be with Tad, you trust him, don&#39;t you?&quot; Amy asked back to her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I trust him... he seems like a smart and responsible kid,&quot; Gary spoke calmly, &quot;but everything has been so on edge... particularly over this reveal and all the nonsense that&#39;s come from it. If there is any protesting, regardless of which way it goes, I want you both to come back. I don&#39;t want my only danger ending up getting caught in a street fight... and I&#39;m sure Mrs. Decker has had enough tragedy in her life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be safe, I promise!&quot; Amy said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise me you&#39;ll come back if you run into anything,&quot; Gary spoke firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Amy protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;He has a fair point, dear,&quot; came her mother&#39;s voice, making Amy turn her head to see her mother, Elizabeth Howler, standing in the doorway to the kitchen, &quot;we may not agree on whether or not this reveal is a good thing... but we will always agree that your safety is important. And things are tense. Maybe not as openly tense as they were at the start of the week... but still tense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy only sighed and nodded. This was one of those things where she privately wished there was a little bit more confidence in her, or her and Tad together, but she had to admit that at least her dad had never gotten into any over protective phase regarding her and Tad. At the same time, she was also grateful that she had parents who did love her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be safe,&quot; Amy promised them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all we can ask for,&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though we would ask that if the end of your date includes any extracurricular activity... that you&#39;re back here no later than midnight,&quot; Gary spoke, &quot;if Tad stays the night with you... that&#39;s fine... since you&#39;re both eighteen. And if you stay the night with him at his house... at least call to let us know. But if you&#39;re just out in the woods... be back by midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Dad,&quot; Amy managed, only to have a knocking come at the front door, &quot;that&#39;s Tad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good night,&quot; Gary said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say hi to Tad for us!&quot; Jay and Leon said together.<br />
<br />
Amy nodded and moved across the room so that she could approach the front door. She opened the door to see a familiar black haired boy standing there with a warm smile and with warm eyes. She returned the smile and then stepped out, shutting the door behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Tad... I&#39;m ready,&quot; Amy declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone okay?&quot; Tad asked her, as he thought he saw Amy&#39;s father and brothers seated on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... they&#39;re just watching television,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;while we have a movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;we won&#39;t know what the movie is till we get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, let&#39;s go,&quot; Amy smiled, &quot;It may not be the newest movie that&#39;s out... but it&#39;ll still be fun. Something that can get us away from all the arguments over the reveal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded and the two set out together with the intent on making it downtown and where Moon Lake&#39;s movie theater was. It wasn&#39;t big and could only show one movie at a time through the course of the day, but it could still provide something that would give some entertainment beyond just the reveal.</p>
