<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Grant was walking over to his friend's house who he normally met up with on the way to school to collect the <br />
pancakes he'd bought from the boy scouts fundraising attempts. He didn't really want to buy them, but Fred had <br />
pressured him into it by going on about the things that his money would improve. He mainly bought them to make <br />
him shut up about it. He knocked on the door and Fred appeared, syrup still around his face from the pancakes <br />
he'd eaten earlier. His clothes looked a bit too small for him. &quot;Hey, here are the pancakes you ordered&quot; he <br />
said, handing over a Styrofoam box to Grant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. I'll eat them on the way. We're already running late and I don't want to get detention again&quot;. Fred <br />
went to grab his shoes and wiped the syrup off his face before running to catch up with Grant who'd already <br />
gone ahead, eating the pancakes as he walked. He didn't have a fork but it didn't matter. The pancakes had <br />
nothing on them, yet tasted very moist. There was an odd twang to them, but they filled him up.<br />
<br />
As they walked, the boys talked about the latest episode of their favourite show, when Fred let out a yelp of <br />
pain. &quot;Ow, my shoes are so tight all of a sudden! I must be having a growth spurt or something&quot;. Grant looked <br />
at his friend and realised he had grown a couple of inches in height, his clothes definitely looked too small <br />
for him now. <br />
<br />
Grant voiced his concerns. &quot;You look taller than before we left. Do growth spurts work that way?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fred shrugged his shoulders and replied &quot;I don't know, I've never had one before&quot;. He could feel that his <br />
midriff was exposed as his shirt was too small. &quot;Look, there's a charity shop nearby. I have some spare pocket <br />
money I could use for new clothes&quot;. He went inside while Grant waited outside, finishing off the pancakes. He <br />
threw the Styrofoam box away just as Fred came out in new, better fitting attire. He looked different, maybe a <br />
bit older? But maybe it was just the light. They had to quickly walk to school now, making it just before the <br />
bell rang. They were in different classes, so separated once they got there. <br />
<br />
Grant sat in his seat while his teacher called out each person's name. One of Fred's boy scout friends was in <br />
his classroom and looked a bit uncomfortable. When the teacher called out his name, he said said &quot;present&quot; in <br />
a deep voice which cracked a bit. He hid his head in embarrassment and other students snickered. The teacher <br />
asked him if he thought he was funny answering in a silly voice and he stammered &quot;No ma'am, I think my voice <br />
is changing&quot;. She gave him a funny look before continuing the rota. Grant thought the boy didn't look like he <br />
fit in the classroom. His clothes were tight on him and he looked like he should be in middle school by now. <br />
While he thought about this, he unconsciously shifted in his seat, feeling like he'd put on the wrong pair of <br />
pants, like they were a size too small. He'd do something about it during recess. The rest of the lesson <br />
seemed to go as normal, until there was a loud rip that echoed through the room. The boy scout's shirt had <br />
ripped along its seams, and he ran out of the room in embarrassment, looking much taller than his classmates. <br />
While Grant pondered what had just happened, he felt his cell phone vibrate. His teacher had gone in search of <br />
the missing student, so he checked the phone. It was a text from Fred which looked urgent. It said to come to <br />
the restrooms immediately. He didn't know how long his teacher would be, so he grabbed a hall pass and left, <br />
hoping she didn't come back. He was starting to feel cramped within his own clothing. He saw an older teenager <br />
run past him without his shirt on in panic, and another teacher followed in pursuit, ignoring Grant. <br />
<br />
He entered the bathroom nearest to Fred's class and called out for his friend. A deep voice called out &quot;is <br />
that you Grant? I'm in this stall&quot;. Grant followed the voice to a closed stall, wondering how his friend got <br />
it to sound so low. He knocked on the door, and a long hairy arm stuck out and pulled him in, covering his <br />
mouth to muffle his screams. It was another teenager, his clothes stretched tight across his lanky body, his <br />
exposed belly had a thin treasure trail on it, and some scruff lined his jawline. &quot;Shhhhh, stop yelling, it's <br />
me Fred! I don't know what's happening, it's like I'm getting older. I texted the other guys and they haven't <br />
responded. I'm so glad you came&quot;. <br />
<br />
Grant looked at the older boy and saw a resemblance to his friend. He was even wearing the same clothes he'd <br />
bought from the charity shop earlier. He remembered the boy from his class having a growth spurt, and that <br />
other shirtless teenager pass by, probably under the same circumstances. Something was happening in the <br />
school. He stopped screaming into the hand and Fred removed it. Then he said &quot;If I hadn't seen two other guys <br />
like you earlier, I wouldn't of believed you. But something's happening. You look like you could be 18 years <br />
old now!&quot;. The teen looked so relieved that his friend actually believed him, then he looked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, two other guys? Do you know who they were?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well one ran by too quick for me to see, but there's one guy in my class who ripped his shirt and left the <br />
room in embarrassment. I think he's in the same boy scout troop as you&quot;. <br />
<br />
It didn't take long to make a connection before they both yelled out &quot;The pancakes!&quot;. Of course, all the boy <br />
scouts had some pancakes from their troop leader, and Grant had eaten some as well. As they spoke, he could <br />
feel his clothes shrink further on him, his arms and legs lengthening. Light hairs were appearing along them. <br />
Fred's body hair was flourishing as well, his flat stomach was getting furrier and his facial hair was filling <br />
in more, looking less like scruff and more like stubble. Whatever was left of his childlike appearance was <br />
quickly fading into the harsh, sharp lines of manhood.<br />
<br />
Fred pulled off his shirt, not wanting to ruin what he'd bought with his own money, revealing a small patch of <br />
hair developing on his chest. He played with the hair, saying &quot;Dude, we look way too old for elementary school <br />
now. How are we going to get out without people thinking we're peverted weirdos?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grant had an idea. He rushed out of the stall, leaving his older friend behind in confusion and left the <br />
restroom. Directly opposite was a fire alarm, which he yanked down before heading back in to Fred. He could <br />
hear the scrapes of chairs as every class evacuated, the sounds of excitable kids running down the halls. They <br />
both waited a few minutes to make sure everyone had left, then ran in the opposite direction to where the <br />
school gathered. They fled the front gates and headed towards a shadowy enclose nearby. Grant ripped off his <br />
shirt in dismay, it was his favourite, and found he was gaining light blond chest hair of his own. He was <br />
probably 18 years old himself now. He felt his face to find scratchy stubble appearing. He looked over to <br />
Fred, who had definitely left puberty behind now, his face coated in a dark shadow whose length was verging on <br />
a purposeful beard. He had left his lanky period behind, now bulking up with large muscle, wiry hair coating <br />
his massive body. His pants had a Hulk-like appearance to them, ripped at the base and clinging to his massive <br />
thighs. His cock was clearly visible through the fabric, straining for release. He had to be 25 at the very <br />
least. They heard someone cough behind them. Turning, they saw 2 other topless men. The tallest looked to be <br />
20 with a slight covering of hair on his pecs, and a patchy beard growing in. The other was shorter and <br />
stocky, looking closer to 30, with thick hair wrapping around his body in contrast the other man. His facial <br />
hair was a couple of inches long, with a few grey hairs on the chin. His hair had already receded a couple of <br />
inches. The older man said &quot;You guys ate the pancakes too?&quot;. They mumbled in agreement and told each other who <br />
they were. The tall man was called Harold, and was the one in Grant's class. The other man was called Peter, <br />
and was the one who ran past in the hallway. Grant noticed they were all aging at different rates. Harold <br />
seemed to be aging the slowest, Grant having already surpassed him in age, meanwhile Fred was aging the <br />
fastest, quickly closing in on the age gap between himself and Peter as grey hairs were piercing through his <br />
hair at an alarming rate. They had to find the troop leader quick before they aged to death, if that were <br />
possible. Grant knew the other boy scouts didn't attend their school. He wondered how they were coping, along <br />
with the others who consumed the tainted food.</p>
