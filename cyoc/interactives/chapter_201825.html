<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Not a native speaker of Spanish so, apologies if my Spanish isn&#39;t the best!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Riley and Emily stayed happily at home, Paul was driving to his job place, with the camera of course. Once he arrived, he decided to see if the camera still worked despite how it looked, so he decided to take a picture of his workplace, accidentally putting his thumb in frame! <br />
<br />
The flash engulfed Paul and the entire construction site. Originally, they had been working on a new office space for the town,  completely modernized for a spoiled rotten child of a CEO but in an instant all their hard work were eradicated as the changes to reality took place. The building and its components eerily vanished, and across the space trees sprouted out alongside grass in the once barren, tilled landscape. Cement and tar mixed as reality forged a paved walkway.<br />
<br />
Gruff workmen all transformed, replaced by different people of different backgrounds and ages. A chubby Asian man’s manboobs blossomed into bouncy breasts, becoming a middle aged light skinned woman, and a stray cat that was chasing after a group of birds quickly sprouted into a large swingset in a newly formed play area. Its prey had frozen, before lurching and twisting into a beautiful stone fountain opposite to the swings, water flowing in and out of their beaks turned into human mouths.<br />
<br />
A snazzy overseer woman that was the CEO’s child’s personal assistant quickly regressed into an adorable baby, being pushed along by a random female jogger who had grown a beard and matured into her new father. A muscular African American shrunk, compacting into a latino teenager, though, his muscles had lingered in the new young man’s tightened physique, his white tank top and jeans melding into a flannel shirt and baggy cargo shorts.<br />
<br />
Nearly everywhere workers had transformed into average citizens enjoying a brisk spring day out in the park, unaware of the previous reality they had hailed from. As Paul&#39;s thumb was in frame, he changed as well, though, in a different manner. In an instant the tall, gruff man expanded outwards as muscular lats spread from his back. His blonde hair re-sprouted, before being buzzed down as his jawline reshaped into a lantern like prominence. His cheap athletic polo shirt tore as Paul’s trapezius muscles puffed up, the rips converting the sleeveless shirt into a tank top that continued to loosen as Paul’s chest heaved forward. Veins criss crossed his biceps and body as Paul’s musculature increased, a solid six pack hammering themselves into his larger gut. <br />
<br />
Wrinkles and age had rewinded in time, Paul was no longer merely a gruff, slightly overweight construction man, Paul had became more and more like a construction of a master sculpturist as his legs thickened into tree trunks. His tacky khaki pants rising in addition to his height as the belt melted into a dark substance. The inky black ichor spread across Paul’s muscular thighs as it reformed into tights, lightening and tinging until all color had been lost, a pearly white. <br />
<br />
Black lines edged across the article as Paul’s gluteus minimus and maximus fought each other for space as they inflated, ensuring Paul had not missed leg day. Splotches of tan sprinkled onto Paul’s alabaster skin, his body coated in tan as his blonde hair darkened into a smooth black. Stubble decorated his thick mug, grooming into a neat form as meaty slabs arose from his chest to caress his jawline, neck bulging obscenely to match the round mass that grew into his vocal box.<br />
<br />
Not to be left behind, as Paul’s biceps inflated to the point he could only hold his arms at his sides, little Paul snaked down his boxers as the cheap cotton reformed and became silken. No longer did they strain to hold up Paul’s massive lower legs, but as the pants snake continued to throb as his balls churned with vitality, the thong proceeded to thin out. It was now hardly noticeable as Paul’s cock had taken on a vastly new form, his eyes changing from a delicate blue color to a smoother dark brown. Tattoos snaked across Paul&#39;s biceps and his ears were adorned with two diamond studs. His nipples tensed as they too were pierced with cold steel.<br />
<br />
Paul had regressed, and while he had once been a builder of apartment buildings or city projects, his new career choice had him focused on building his body to even larger proportions. Of course, with all awareness turned off, even Pablo Dominguez wouldn’t be able to tell that anything was amiss, just as an older woman behind him had also shrunk in contrast, years of living wiped away as she had quickly taken on to a similar skin tone to Pablo.<br />
<br />
Red hair tinted auburn, then brown, to night black as her breasts receded, her genitals slicking and reformatting into a new form as her existence was cemented as <I>his</I>. Her face gained fat as she continued to revert into her formative years, baby fat still clinging to her small form as the new 5 year old boy’s summer dress had contracted and split into a simple Transformer’s t shirt and baby blue basketball shorts.<br />
<br />
Pablo blinked away as his vision slowly returned, groaning deeply in irritation.<br />
<br />
“Qué mierda…” Pablo spoke, before quickly looking in concern around him, iron grip locked onto the camera.<br />
<br />
Johanna, no, Juan, looked about in fear, he was unaware of his original fate, but that didn’t stop him from being a little scared of everything. The world was scary, he remembered someone told him, someone big, and strong, someone he looked up to. He was a brave boy, but he was all alone, he could-<br />
<br />
“Juan!” Pablo called out, massive arms flying up as he smiled widely.<br />
<br />
“Papa!” Juan said aloud, running to his father and hugging his large frame as Pablo ran a hand through his dark raven hair.<br />
<br />
Pablo shook his head and laughed deeply, there was his pride and joy, ever since his mother passed away Pablo was balancing raising his son by himself and his love for the gym. It wasn’t easy, but the heaviest weights can be lifted the highest with the right motivation.<br />
<br />
“My brave boy,” Pablo said. “How are you enjoying the park with your old man?” He said, easily hoisting the small boy with one hand.<br />
<br />
Juan giggled, struggling and calling for his father to put him down. Someday, he was going to be that big too!<br />
<br />
“I like it! But, it’s not the same as playing with my friends…” He said, sadly.<br />
<br />
Pablo smirked. It was easy to change a frown upside down with a simple trick.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you go play with them? We can see if they’re here today, and, if they ain’t, we’ll have some McDonalds. On me.” Pablo beamed with pride.<br />
<br />
“Really!” Juan jumped with excitement.<br />
<br />
“Of course mijo. These muscles ever lie?” Pablo smiled, flexing an engorged bicep as his son attempted to mirror it.<br />
<br />
A dark skin woman, that was originally a white man who was a surveyor whistled intently as she passed by with her gal pals, music pumping in their ears and Paul running in their minds.<br />
<br />
“Haha, looks like I still got it…” Pablo thought to himself, before looking down and realizing the item still clenched in his hands.<br />
<br />
“Eh… Juanito,” Pablo said. Juan looked up with concern.<br />
<br />
“Yes papa?”<br />
<br />
“Do you remember this camera, by chance?” Pablo said, looking into the lens as his brain racked itself trying to find an answer.<br />
<br />
He could feel something there wanting to use it, maybe on him, maybe around him, maybe even on Juan… But for some reason, Pablo could not understand what this camera was for.<br />
<br />
Juan paused.<br />
<br />
“Wasn’t that the camera you said you and mama had, before I was born?” Juanito said, unsure.<br />
<br />
Pablo mused, looking into the piece of tech in his hands… That was when he decided…</p>
