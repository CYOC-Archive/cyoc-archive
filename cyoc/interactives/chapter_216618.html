<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Had Jules been aware that the emerald gemstone he had stolen from the janitor was actually a magical artifact, one that had been slowly charging itself up for a wish while the bully had been silently fuming about his life, he might have chosen his next words differently. He might not have said anything at all, instead dropping the stone on the tile floor of the bathroom and letting the pent up angry energy dissipate before picking it up and inspecting it.<br />
<br />
But the bully had been completely unaware, too caught up in his anger at his so called &#39;friend&#39; Rob Bolstrum and desiring the kind of friendship the kids in the library seemed to share with one another. And so Jules, staring up at the plain ceiling of the school bathroom and completely unaware of the green-gold light streaming out of the cracks in hist closed fist that held the stone, changed his life forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Rob would just be nicer to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The magical power that had been charging within the gemstone was released in a flash of light that, had it not re-written reality in an instant, would have caught the attention of the students in the school library. Instead, they simply continued on with their after-school activities as Jules Harper vanished from the halls of Shermer High, having now never been there at all. And as for Jules, the last thing he remembered before his reality was blasted away, was the feeling of falling, and darkness taking over the brilliant emerald light that was blinding him. And then there was the feeling of soft warmth covering him before consciousness left him entirely as his new reality settled in place around him.<br />
<br />
*BZZ BZZ BZZ BZZ*<br />
<br />
The electronic racket caused Jules&#39;s eyes to snap open, darkness giving way to a softly lit room that, at the moment, more closely resembled a blurry oil painting. The only thing that stood out were the glowing read numbers that read 7:00am, their brightness like knives stabbing at Jules&#39;s eyes. He squinted his eyes shut and shot out a hand, his fingers colliding painfully with hard molded plastic as his brain registered the familiar shape of his alarm clock sitting on the cheap bedside table he&#39;d bought from a garage sale a few years ago, right next to his wallet, pocket knife and the ash tray he&#39;d stolen from said garage sale. He grunted as pain suddenly shot through his skull, a dull pounding that coincided with a queasy feeling in his stomach.<br />
<br />
&#39;Fuck, did I pass out?&#39; Jules wondered, slowly registering that he was,in fact, in bed. How did he get there? Wasn&#39;t he just in the bathroom by the school library? Jules scrunched his eyes as the world swam more into focus, the bathroom seeming more like a fading dream now, but the alarm didn&#39;t wait for the bully to get his bearings as it continued it&#39;s synthesized shriek. He guided his hands across the surface and pushed the Snooze button, the alarm clock&#39;s wailing ending with a low beep as Jules let his hand go slack in relief as relative silence filled the bedroom. Outside were the familiar sounds of the Shermer Fields trailer court coming to life for the day, but everything else was quiet, normal.<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe I just came home and got shitfaced. Probably explains the headache&#39; The teenager said, pulling his arm back in under the warmth of the covers, willing himself to go back to sleep as the limb settled against two mounds of flesh that tingled as he brushed against the shirt that hung over them.<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
Jules&#39;s eyes snapped open once more, his head launching from his pillow as his arm rose upwards sending the small comforter flying off his body and exposing it to the world. Cold air rushed across small bare feet and two slender legs and sent a involuntary shiver through Jules&#39;s body as he stared in horror at himself.<br />
<br />
There, dressed in nothing more than a pair of plain panties and an oversized t-shirt, was a very feminine body that Jules was apparently attached to. He sucked in air as his eyes widened even more, his generous chest heaving upwards towards him as he simply stared in shock at the smooth, tan skin that covered his legs, the small hand that moved in front of his face, the strange tickle as brown hair fell in front of his vision and was now gently pulling at the back of his head. The weight of his large breasts and somewhat tubby stomach that was revealed as the t-shirt settled upon it&#39;s bulging form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Oh god. OH GOD&quot; The boy turned woman screamed, his new higher voice causing him to flail even more as a hand clasped his now slender throat. Another hand shot up to his face, Jules winced inpain as he poked himself in the eye with a nail that was certainly longer than he remembered it being, his tiny palm tracing around a much smaller nose and a set of lips that had no business being that puffy.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT!&quot; Jules screamed once more as he launched himself out bed and falling immediately on his face as his personal center of gravity failed to assert itself. But the flare of pain did nothing to stop him as Jules flailed about on the floor, a hand shooting inside the panties that hugged his feminine hips that simply confirmed what he already knew: His penis had been replaced by a womanly slit.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; Jules rolled across the floor as bile built up in his stomach, and he clambered to his new, tiny feet as stumbled his way out his bedroom door, hitting the hallway wall and guiding himself to the equally small bathroom on his end of the house, flicking on the light and collapsing in front of the toilet, breasts swinging wildly from the erratic movements as he gripped both sides of the porcelain throne and heaved, salty, burning tears filling his eyes as stomach acid made it&#39;s way out of his transformed body and into the water below. His new brown hair hung shook violently around him as his body arched and shuddered until it was finally spent, Jules collapsing in an exhausted heap against the bathtub rim and wiping a thick ribbon of spittle away, his face coated in sweat has he gasped for air, which only further reminded him of the massive orbs on his chest.<br />
<br />
Of course, that was when he was given another surprise; the sound of feet padding down the hallway towards his bathroom, which he was starting to notice was filled with feminine products instead of it&#39;s usual spartan appearance.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh shit, dad!&#39; Jules thought in alarm, staring at the doorway in dread as he struggled to come up with some kind, any kind of reason to explain to his dad why Isaac Harper&#39;s only child, his son, was now a woman.<br />
<br />
But instead of the haggard, bloated form of Jules&#39;s father, instead the hulking mass of someone else slid into view. Someone with a mess of short red hair and a face that looked as if the entire ugly tree had just decided to fall on it. Someone that was wearing nothing more than a pair of underwear that did little to hide the bulge of a cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Rob?&quot; Jules squeaked in surprise as his &#39;friend&#39; or more accurately, his &#39;boss&#39; in the previous reality leaned against the door frame and and rubbed his eyes with a hammer-like fist. &quot;What...What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it that bad this morning?&quot; Rob said with a yawn as he blinked away the last of the sleep in his eyes. The giant&#39;s nose wrinkled in disgust before he reached over and flushed the toilet, sending the contents of Jules&#39;s stomach into the sewer system. &quot;Bleh, must have been. Good thing your hair didn&#39;t get in it&quot;. Rob rubbed his face with a massive palm before stretching it down towards Jules, or rather, Julie&#39;s bewildered form.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, get off that floor and I&#39;ll take you back to bed&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jules&#39;s mind was racing a million miles a minute. How was he a girl!? Why was Rob here!? Where was his dad!? What was Rob talking about!? WHY WAS HE A GIRL!? But despite all of this, the teenage boy turned girl felt himself reach out and take Rob&#39;s hand, bracing for the vice grip the larger bully often used but finding it to be surprisingly gentle, if a little firm. With barely any effort Jules felt himself being pulled upwards, his center of gravity wheeling once more as he fell against Rob&#39;s muscled, hairy chest. He looked up at Rob and realized that his new body was short. Not crazy short, but definitely shorter than he had been before, his head didn&#39;t even clear Rob&#39;s pecs! But the former bully saw something flash in his periphreal vision, and turned his head towards it.<br />
<br />
He heard Rob&#39;s voice rumble something, but Jules never heard what. he was enraptured by the face staring back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit&quot; Jules whispered as he stared at his reflection. Was this what he would have looked like if he was a girl? Large, bright blue eyes started out at him, a narrow, cute nose with nostrils that flared with every breath he took, agape, kissable lips that looked as if they already had an application of lipstick, and small, white teeth hiding behind them. There was a little bit of puffiness to his new face, seemingly because he was a little tubby now, but overall he wasn&#39;t too far from being a total knockout. Almost as if someone had mushed his face up with that Jane chick from Breaking Bad!<br />
<br />
Jules watched one of Rob&#39;s large hands slid into the reflection and cupped his tiny chin, turning his head away from the mirror to look upwards at Rob&#39;s face, locking onto his brown eyes that, for the first time that Jules could remember, weren&#39;t glaring or filled with hate and rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, earth to Julie! you in there? Babe&quot; Rob said, his voice full of concern.<br />
<br />
Jules simply stared upwards for a moment before he realized he needed to respond. &quot;Oh, uh, yes? I mean yeah? It, uh, yeah I must have had too many beers last night!&quot; Jules thought it was a perfect enough answer, but Rob&#39;s face scrunched in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Julie, you haven&#39;t had a beer since you got pregnant!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;PREGNANT!?&quot; Jules screamed in alarm. He looked down in horrified realization at his bulging stomach, and then went limp in Rob&#39;s arms as he promptly passed out from the morning&#39;s final shock.</p>
