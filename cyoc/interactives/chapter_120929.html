<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert or &quot; Rob&quot; Leer was starting his new job. He had been extremely lucky for this opportunity. Even though the recession started ten years ago Robert and his family was still struggling. He had taught business and financial managing at a business school funded mostly through the state. After the recession the state needed to cut &quot; unnecessary assets&quot; so the college instead of facing closure fired almost half of the employees. Robert had worked a series of odd jobs ever sense. No one seemed to be hiring. His wife and three children resented him. That was up until 1 month ago when Wechsler Academy had called him. <br />
 The school&#39;s own principle had personally called him asking him if he would like to work at the school. He had been living in New York at the time but the California based school didn&#39;t see that as an obstacle. The school paid for their flight out west and paid for their new house very close to the school. It seemed as though the school has built and owned the small community with the school centered at it. The community formed a sort of circle with the interstate, county line, suburbs and a lake as the borders. 12 miles in every direction was approximately the distance between the school and the borders. His entire family was provided with a sort of credit card that allowed him to buy practically anything and it had a seemingly endless limit on it. There was a grocery store, gym, mall, and even an airfield. The school had encouraged the family to enjoy this benefit. Robert was hesitant thinking it to good to be true at first but after his eldest son bought a bran new Ford F-150 Raptor. At first Robert immediately called the principle thinking that surely a 50,000 dollar truck was stepping over the line. But when Robert called to apologize for the inappropriate purchase the principle merely laughed and encouraged Robert to spend as much as he liked. Robert bought a 1965 Shelby cobra the very next day.<br />
 It came out the same year he was born making Robert 52 years old. He had an 18 year old boy named Chad, a 17 year old daughter named Stephanie, and a 15 year old boy named Alex. Robert was thinking about all of this as he drove up to the school. Even though he lived a mile away from the school he had never set foot on the grounds. He drove up to the top of the hill and passed through a giant archway withe the school&#39;s named engraved in the stone. He then up to a guard station. He stopped and was greeted by a young man in his twenties. <br />
&quot; What is the purpose of your visit?&quot; the man said with unusually large smile.<br />
&quot; It&#39;s my first day as a teacher hear. I have a meeting with the principle before the first day of school starts in an hour.<br />
&quot; Of course. Of course. Your Mr. Leer. We have anticipated your arrival. Just find a spot in the parking garage under the school and head right on up to the office.&quot; he said along with the smile that always reappeared after every word.<br />
&quot; Thanks I guess.&quot; he said as the guard lifted the metal bar up.<br />
<br />
He followed the road to the main building following the signs to the parking lot. He was amazed at how perfect the campus was. The flowers we neat and bright the grass looked freshly cut. The pavement looked like it had been power washed. The buildings looked so futuristic and clean. He saw a huge auditorium, what sports center, parks everywhere, and even a helicopter pad. He found the underground garage and drove down to find a parking spot. He parked in between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini. He walked to the elevator and pressed the level 1 button. Some cheesy elevator music played as he ascended. He walked out of the elevator and followed the signs that directed him to the main office. He walked into the office and met the receptionist. He told her his name and appointment. She kindly told him to wait and take a seat.<br />
<br />
 Robert was extremely nervous. He got up and walked into the bathroom down the hall. He looked in the mirror dissatisfied with the reflection. The last ten years had taken their tole. He had gained weight, a lot of weight, his receding hairline had been receding faster as well as thinning hair. Wrinkles had lengthened and gotten deeper and were more numerous. His hair had gone from jet black with a few grey streaks on the side to full on grey-white. He looked at him self and wondered why anyone would want to hire him. He noticed a few beads of sweat around his neck and on his forehead. He wiped them off on a paper towel and walked back to the waiting room. After two minutes of mind raking dead silence except for the receptionist&#39;s typing on her computer he was called to see his new boss.<br />
<br />
 He walked in the door labeled &quot; Principle Smith&quot; and saw an extremely younger man than he was expecting. He looked to be fresh out of college he couldn&#39;t have been more than 23. Mr.Smith had coal dark hair cut very short on the sides but longer and styled in the middle. He had striking blue eyes and a pure white smile. He was also shirtless in gym shorts doing pull ups on a bar in his office. He jumped off of the bar and walked over to Robert and hugged him. Despite looking sweaty from a distance he smelled like lemongrass and sage. He was extremely defined with pure discs for pectorals and washboard abs for a stomach. His biceps looked like someone had shoved baseballs inside. When he pulled back from the hug. Robert noticed that Mr.Smith had a treasure trail leading to a huge metal pipe for an erection. Mr.Smith fixed himself and started talking to him.<br />
&quot; Mr.Leer it&#39;s so good to see you in person. What a nice visit to start our first day of the school year. Tell me do you like your new house? I designed it myself.&quot; he said in a manly tone. And took a seat<br />
&quot; Me and Amelia love the house. The kids especially love the pool.&quot; he responded<br />
&quot; I thought you would enjoy that I had it lengthened to 25 meters so that so that Chad can start getting in shape for swim season. But let&#39;s get down to business now I know I have left you in the dark about the curriculum and the classes you thought you would have been teaching this year. And I know that has probably driven you nervous and anxious up the wall but to ease your fears you wont be teaching classes at all.&quot; he said<br />
Robert was confused at first he probably didn&#39;t hear him correctly he was still puzzled as to how he knew that Chad was a swimmer. <br />
&quot; Can you say that again I don&#39;t think I heard you correctly.&quot; he said trying not to be embarrassed.<br />
&quot; You wont be teaching classes at Wechsler Academy isn&#39;t that great? You wont have to stress anymore.&quot;<br />
&quot; That&#39;s what I thought you said. Have I done anything wrong was it the car I bought I promise if I spent to much I will return if that&#39;s an issue. Because I really need this job here Mr.Smith. I don&#39;t want to be unemployed again. This would be my eleventh job in ten years. Please don&#39;t send me away.&quot; he pleaded<br />
&quot; First things first Calm down Mr.Leer. You are going to be working here just not as a teacher. Secondly call me Jason. Thirdly, you can spend as much money as you want with those cards feel free I don&#39;t care.&quot; he said in a calm voice<br />
&quot; I&#39;m sorry Mr.Smi- Jason. I&#39;m so embarrassed and confused. If I am not working as a teacher, what am I doing here?&quot; he said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;ll explain that in a story. I was in a relationship fresh out of high school. We had been dating for almost three years. She was beautiful and smart and everything wonderful in the world. But later she contracted in illness during the first year of college. The doctors didn&#39;t know what was causing it but her heart was slowly beating slower and slower. She was always tired taking naps that could last days. She was never hungry. But she lost so much weight. She started loosing memories first forgetting where she was then who I was then who she was. Then................ one day during her long sleeps she closed her eyes forever.<br />
<br />
 I was broken. She meant everything to me. It was all gone my world gone, my joy gone, my future gone, my love.....gone. I couldn&#39;t feel any emotion. I wasn&#39;t happy all I wanted to do was sleep and remiss. I sank into depression for an entire year then suddenly I woke up. Suddenly I could do anything I wished to have blonde hair I had blonde hair. I wished to be rich and famous. Suddenly I was a famous model in a photo shoot. I had the power to bend reality to my will. It was if some higher power had given me a second chance. But no matter how much I tried I couldn&#39;t bring her back. So instead I tried to prevent another death like hers.<br />
<br />
 I built this school and everything in it and around it to push the limits of education. Here we will create a Utopian community of extremely smart and outstanding minds to solve the worlds greatest mysteries. But I have noticed something; my powers are failing. I didn&#39;t know if one day I was going to wake up with no powers. If that happened my promise to her would mean nothing. I did what little I could and transferred most of my power into two rings. One I have already given away to someone else that will have your job. And this one here let me grab it is for you.&quot; He said as he placed a silver ring off of his finger onto the desk. <br />
&quot; I need people to carry on this mission. I cant make everything perfect at this school but I can try to. I don&#39;t want the regular problems schools face to cripple this one. I need you to protect this school from the people that would seek to disrespect our mission here. Your job his to use this ring to protect the mission and this school. The ring will help you but I am not even sure the limits of its power it could have less or more power than mine. You do this and you can have everything you ever wanted. What do you say?&quot;<br />
&quot; I say your a fucking lunatic who doesn&#39;t know what their talking about. I&#39;m sorry but i need a real job not some fantasy.&quot; Robert said in pure confusion and anger.<br />
He got up from his seat and walked to the door. He grabbed the handle but it wouldn&#39;t open he pulled with all his might but it wouldn&#39;t budge. He turned to Jason but was met with his face mushed against a solid steel pack of abs. He looked up and standing at ten feet tall was Jason all muscled from here to the floor. Robert was left in shock. Jason had gone from sitting at his desk with a defined body to a giant superhuman body builder standing right over him.</p>
