<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your reason for not being an animal are built on strong long learned morals of how things should remain. The conversation with Doc Thule shows an attitude simular to governments worldwide. One can see a pattern forming as his ways and means are bit by bit explained, Its all one sided for a deep dark purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you spending this time with and on me, you don't do with others? I appreciate that I wasn't just sent into some quick and final form but this is so..............!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Doctor looks peeved at you as he begins to speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;You may be quite right, we have spent a lot of time on you and this is taking me away from what needs to be done. I was toying with just adding to your meals the formula and let it sort of sneak up on you when the mind is associated with other matters. Yet you are in my thinking more like one of the volunteers as you use your logical mind  reason why I do this. I do it out of some maniacal love for watching those change. I love to see them fight what they can not control. Then too their own sexual desires build and they are forced to become as perverted in their thoughts by a wild passion for sex. As they try to quell the deires by maturbating first, then humping imaginary lovers the seeds of instincts are sown. As they delight in sex and sensual gratifications the transformation increases. In wild heights of sexual mounting, humping, the mind makes the final acceptance of what they will be and I have a well meaning obediant animal!&quot; explains Doctor Thule as you note his trouser's front now tents quite high.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would really some day like to join them, to become an animal free of all cares except your one lusting desire, sex!&quot; you state as the Doctor gives you a cold stare.<br />
<br />
The golf cart pulls up to a building and stepping out the Doctor turns his back your way to brush down is excited erection. The two of you walk into the building and as the door opens there is a din of moanings, groanings, and bleating.<br />
<br />
&quot;You watch but say nothing as there be here most in their final state of changes. I want nothing more than to show you another fine line of animals but to converse with them at length would be detrimental.&quot; the Doc warns per your common reactions thus far.<br />
<br />
Stepping inside there be goats, and creatures looking mostly like goats but still having hands or semihuman faces. One young looking male creature who reminds you of mythical pictures of Satyrs is humped over a large female goat his rump thrusting his penis deep but acting like its never deep enough. He huffs, the groans, they are mindless other than to be in the throngs of wild procreative sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Bobby a good male on his way to be a fine sire goat!&quot; the doc whispers to you.<br />
<br />
You walk on as the smell is acrid from spurting urine squirts and goat semen plastered everywhere. One looks at these what were humans and sees them as wild brute feeling animals having lost that divine spark.<br />
<br />
Sudenly jumping over one of the barriers seperating you from the action comes a half changed female. Her face is mostly changed, she has ears of a goat. Shaggy hair drapes down off her head, to neck, and shoulders. Her breasts are large but the nipples extend out maybe three inches and are black of color. In the split second as she cleared the wall you note this all and more.<br />
<br />
As she lands on you forcing you backwards and knocking you down to the floor her shapely hips, peaked buttocks, tail and legs which would make any goat proud.<br />
<br />
Moaning she makes one know she wants sex from you and wishes you to enter her stall for wild passionate romps in the straw. You try to ward her off but those fuzzy lips keep oushing their way past your flaying hands to nibble at your lips and cheeks.<br />
<br />
Out of nowhere comes a big brute of a man as he grabs her by the back of the neck picking her right up off the floor. Her goaty legs kicking wildly almost nails the Doctor in his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inject her with the final dose!&quot; orders the Doctor as the female squeals and tries to beg for mercey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, enough of this place!&quot; says the Doc as he heads for the door.<br />
<br />
One can see just how close the females hoof came as there be a dirty spot on the Doctor's trousers just near his right hip. His anger you see while enjoying the sexual depavity roll along he was almost a willing part.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you see how goats can do it and with their changes get into frenzied almost orgy like sexual mayhem!&quot; he says as getting into the Golf cart. &quot;No you walk I have things to care to and your not to be part of them!&quot; says the Doc his voice still showing his anger.<br />
<br />
Off he goes in a cloud of dust ans exhaust in his hot little cart. You now are quite a distance from the mansion and must walk back but with the walking you have time to look around.<br />
<br />
A short distnace from the gooat barn is a very large and tall red barn being the only barn of that color you have seen. Walking through a service door you find yourself in an isleway set between several corals fenced with horizontal steel bars. Inside the first is one huge reddish haired and his nostrils flare as a reddish skin he is a bull. <br />
<br />
You peer through the bars as the big animal snorts and paws the ground as if angered by your presence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take it easy big boy I might be joining you inside a couple of weeks!&quot; you say out loud as there not a human or handler in sight.<br />
<br />
The snorts but its more like a sigh of relief as then slowly it plods your way looking very tame. His huge boned head slips halfway past the steer bars and oggles you with his dark eyes while licking nervously his snot dripping nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn there brother but you are one huge big bull!&quot; you compliment the animal on his beastly form.<br />
<br />
This seems to make it happy and since he doesn't make any threating moves you begin to pet his head and scratch his long floppy ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen, his name is Allen and I know if he's letting you pet him as if an animal he likes you.&quot; says a voice from higher up and behind you.<br />
<br />
Turning to look one spies the figure of a muscle builder type his shoulders must be sixty inches across. He jumps down to the isleway letting you see he is maybe seven feet tall and like his shoulders everything is bursting of mucscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your their caretaker?&quot; you ask timidly.<br />
<br />
He smiles, &quot;Yes I keep this part of the Foundation running smoothly. Your petting the most angry of bulls we have bred here yet! He hates everybody here and I suspect for the simple reason he came here as a drug salesman only to be one of the Doc's fiancial success stories.&quot; says this big man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there others as he?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
The man waves you to follow and walking down the isleway one sees animal after animal standing looking at you seemingly all very nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't know but think your a buyer!&quot; says the man as he walks on.<br />
<br />
A bellowing moo comes from one very red colored cow. She prances about nervously and then approaching the fence near you juts out a hard squirt of urine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luck it missed you or her infected body liquids would infect you and we'd have a new convert in just two weeks. No come along and I'll show you what you asked to see.&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
Walking out a wide opened barn door your eyes widen to see a herd of hundreds. The deep reddish colored cows all stand and look your way as some begin to walk toward you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Red Angus, that's what we breed here as converts come most be bulls, we let them mate and then sell off the calves. As I'm sure you expect everyone of those mature cows was like you and me when first they came here. I know them by name, each ahs here own attitude and most being mated at least twice have slipped past those human bonds to be just nice and loving cows. You factual in telling Allen that your considering joining the herd?&quot; he askes you as if it be like entering a private health club.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, can't tell yet the Doctor has been showing me around.&quot; you remark to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, he never does that unless your somebody real special. You do him a favor, he makes those who favor him become more blessed among animals than most! You keep him in your pocket as long as it hold cause if he gets angry at you your on your way to well, how can say?&quot; tells the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of you, your human and a fine big specimen too! Why do you stay on?&quot; you ask even if you think you know why.<br />
<br />
He smiles and then reaching down unbuckles his belt, pops the snap, and falling to his ankles goes his jeans.<br />
<br />
Your eyes bug out as the sight of reddish hair, deep red skin and of all things in his crotch is a udder of a cow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your....!&quot; you begin to state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, as long as I work good for the Doc I remain upright. If I screw up then to the pasture I go as one of my cows.&quot; he says as hands reach down and hoist up the jeans. <br />
<br />
He wiggles the jeans some to force his udder into the crotch and with a jerk he snaps the jeans top. His belt seals the jeans tight and his narrow waist once again looks very human.<br />
<br />
Leaning over to speak in your ear he says, &quot;I'm almost willing and ready to be a cow after some days of working around here. One be around all the subjects as the Doc calls them and their constant preoccupation with sex, well it can drive you sex crazy too!&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake his or her hand and head out the isleway the way you came inside. Once out side the mooing of cows naer their fence line makes you look but with tails held high you walk away quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn crazy place its like searching for the right car to buy while having to keep you mind off sex!&quot; you think to yourself as one walks down the road.</p>
