<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was certainly an unusual experience, Rachel thought. To be carried like this by someone - carried like a piece of luggage. She could hear Brooke grunting and groaning as she carried her - and the sensations of being jostled around like this were driving Rachel up the wall with pleasure. But that seemed to be true for anything now - this was her new existence, at least for the time being. Every bit of movement seemed destined to make her feel the Most Intense pleasure she&#39;d ever felt. Wrapped up as she was in the blanket, she couldn&#39;t really see or hear much, though she heard Brooke make a laughing comment to someone - probably a neighbor or one of her family members. It didn&#39;t really matter to Rachel much - she was a nonentity in this moment. <br />
<br />
Eventually, she heard a door open and close, and Brooke continued to carry her until she was unceremoniously thrown and dropped onto what she was fairly certain was Brooke&#39;s bed. Rachel felt her silicone body jiggling all over as she settled down, but it wasn&#39;t long until Brooke began to unwrap the blanket, sending fresh new orgasmic sensations rushing over her. <br />
<br />
And then Brooke was there, looking down at you with a lustful expression on her face. &quot;And here we are,&quot; she whispered to Rachel, her breath hot on her silicone skin. &quot;I&#39;m going to take such good care of you.&quot; She giggled - she actually fucking giggled. <br />
<br />
Rachel felt a new wave of anger overcome her. She&#39;d been turned into an inanimate sex toy, and here Brooke was, giggling like a schoolgirl. Like it was just some big joke! Rachel couldn&#39;t do a thing under her own power, and Brooke was getting turned on by it! It wasn&#39;t fair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, that was an effort to get you over here,&quot; Brooke continued. &quot;You&#39;re heavier than you look!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seething, Rachel wished she could respond or punch Brooke. Of course she was heavy - her skeleton had probably been replaced by a metal frame - because of what BROOKE had done to her! I hope your back aches from this for a week, you bitch! <br />
<br />
God, she wish Brooke had just fucking talked to her about her feelings! What did Brooke think was going to happen?? Rachel never would&#39;ve made fun of her for being gay. Hell, she probably would&#39;ve been open to trying things out with Brooke. Instead, Brooke had gone to a fucking witch and the witch had given her something that had turned her into a fucking SEX DOLL. Who the FUCK did that to someone? And - fucking hell, it hadn&#39;t even really sunk in yet - a WITCH had done this to her! Witches were real? And magic was real? And THIS was what it had done to her?? It was insanity! She&#39;d gone from existing in a world where magic wasn&#39;t real to one where, not only was it real, it was apparently capable of ruining your life in a matter of moments. <br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s current train of thought was interrupted by Brooke&#39;s presence returning. Brooke locked her door and approached the bed, straddling Rachel&#39;s naked doll form. Brooke began to massage Rachel&#39;s silicone tits, sending them jiggling atop her frame. Once again, Rachel found herself entering into a state of pure orgasmic bliss - hardly aware of what was going on, but still somehow being aware of every detail as Brooke ground her body desperately against Rachel&#39;s artificial one. God, she must really be turned on by this, Rachel thought. I can actually feel her pussy throbbing against me, and when she looks at me like that...fuck this feels so good...if this is what my life is going to be like, maybe it won&#39;t be so bad...no...I can&#39;t think like that...but it feels...feels so good...Brooke...why...?<br />
<br />
Brooke eventually relented, and left Rachel in the bed, mentally whimpering to herself as the sensations of bliss died down. She could hear the shower running. Eventually Brooke returned, wearing a nightie now, and she snuggled up next to Rachel in bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good night Rachel,&quot; Brooke whispered. &quot;My perfect little love doll,&quot; she cooed, putting her arms around Rachel&#39;s silicone form. <br />
<br />
And then she fell asleep, nestled against Rachel. Rachel could only lie there in silence - cursing at the pleasure she felt, and grappling with another new revelation of her current situation. As a sex doll, it seemed as though she was just...always on. Her mind was active and aware, regardless of her situation. The one exception seemed to be when she was getting so stimulated that it seemed to just override her consciousness. But right now, lying there in the dark, her mind was simply just...active. It seemed sleep wasn&#39;t something dolls got to do. Just fucking great, she thought. It&#39;s bad enough I can&#39;t move - I&#39;m literally just locked in my body now? This is going to be boring enough without having to be conscious all the time. What am I going to do?<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
There was literally nothing she COULD do. Even if someone saw her, they&#39;d never think, oh, there&#39;s Rachel, she must&#39;ve been turned into a sex doll. Who the fuck would think that? No one - well, no one except another witch maybe, but before today, she&#39;d never even thought witches were real, so...who knew how the fuck common they were! No, most people would probably just think Brooke was a weird stalker who had ordered a realistic sex doll who LOOKED like Rachel. <br />
<br />
Her only hope at this point was that Brooke would develop a conscious or guilt about what had happened to her. <br />
<br />
And as yet another mind-numbing orgasm roiled through her inert form, Rachel thought, at least this feels good. And she hated that she thought that. And hated that she was craving the next time Brooke would play with her. Hated that she craved the white hot sensations of pleasure that being used as a doll sent through her. <br />
<br />
But crave them she did.</p>
