<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scene 1: Walter was a very Successful business man. And at age 58 he deserved things he could flaunt around, money, a nice sports car, and of course a &quot;Trophy&quot; wife. The had only been married a week when he wanted to show off the 25 year old Candy to his Friends and Co-workers at a party. 
<br />
As they aproached the condo door Candy said she forgot her purse in the car. Not wanting to be late he went ahead in without her. He put on a big smile even though his smashing entrance was ruin, knowing that the look on all their faces would be classic when they saw his stunningly beautiful young wife. 
<br />
A few minutes later whispers circulated the room. However they weren't the whispers Walter was expecting: &quot;I thought you said Walt got hitched with a chick over half his age.&quot;, &quot;Wow, you know i'm very proud of Walter. He used to be so vain. But obviously love got the better of him, marrying such a heavy woman. &quot;Well thats nothing spectactular, Hell MY wife looks better than that&quot; &quot;Wait I've met walts new wife, that must be her mother. I wonder why she came and Candy didn't&quot; 
<br />
Finally Walter went over to find out what the hell was going on. He looked for Candy frantically. Then fianlly he heard (In a voice that didn't sound quite right) &quot;Yes i'm Walters wife. He's such a wonderful man.&quot; He turn around and what greeted him wasn't the busty young fresh faced blonde he married. But an older, heavyset woman. Her hair was dirty blonde with gray streaks and her body didn't quite fit into her gown which was tear in the seams. Her body was sagging especially her cheeks and her breasts. Her beautiful breasts were now limply drooping and straining her clothing. She looked old. She looked HIS age. What happened?
<br />

<br />
Scene 2: Suddenly every girl in Mr. Daltons sixth grade class squeelled as they aged to 28 years old. Many of them grew up quite shapely, breasts formed where they had only been hinted at before. Their pineing after their good looking teacher was interupted by clothes ripping and bursting and their desks becoming much to small for their womanly bodies. The twelve year old boys grew wide eyed and thank god for this miracle as their female classmates had become half naked adult women. The young single Mr. Dalton stood their mouth agape, stuck with a conflict of interests.
<br />

<br />
Scene 3: Heather had married George for the money. At first. He being a sickly millionaire of 82 years of age and she being a vivacious former model of 22 years of age, it was quite clear the motive. And with a 60 year difference the may/december romance was certainly one for the records. But now after a year she saw a side to George she hadn't seen in anyone her whole life. He was kind hearted, sensitive, good natured. And he put up with him. Yes of course she was beautiful, and what guy wouldn't love her. But she felt like it was more than that. Not quite LOVE on his half, but more like he was giving her a life lesson. And no one had cared enough to do that to her her entire life. So now she loved him, she didn't want him to die. Or at least she didn't want to go on living after he did. And such a large age difference. She'd have decades left after he was gone and she would probably never find a man who loves her for herself ever again. She would find men who shower her with attention because of her large breast and beautiful body. Because of her great hair and firm ass. Because of her long legs and cute feet. She looked at her body up and down in the bathroom mirror, sighing at the thought that no other man would see beyond this. She felt sorry for all the times she cheated on George but with his poor health and age love making was out of the question. 
<br />
She dropped her towel and got into the shower. Still contemplating her new found love for her geriatric husband. When she got out of the shower she rapped her hair in the towel and looked at her nude body once more in the mirror. She gasped. What greeted her eyes was the wrinkled, shriveled body of a woman in her seventies or eighties. Not a young model. Gone was her long legs and smooth feet. replaced by wrinkled sticks and veined feet with bent toes and yellow toenails. Her belly seaped over her pelvis give her a wrinkled paunch and her breasts were barely recognizable. Wrinkled shrivled sacks plopping onto her chest with stretched nipples. Her hair that was peaking out from the towel was all gray and her face was a collapsed mass of creases. Her bent over sagging body look horrible. She looked like that old woman from the titanic. A tear ran down her wrinkled cheek. But it wasnt quite a tear of loss. SHe understood why this had happened. This was her punishment for her vainity and the hurt she caused George. Now they were the same age. they could live the rest of their lives together. She could now relate to the man she loved. And maybe George would love her back. No more taking things for granted. For one of the first time in Heathers short life she was happy. And tonight would be the most passionate night in Georges life, in a long time.
<br />

<br />
Scene 4: Prudence waited all morning for him. He always came like clockwork at 3:00. Of course at the ripe old age of 91 Prudy had been awake all morning. He was the highlight of her day and he reminded her so much of her Harry, god rest his soul. Of course 'HE' Mark Riley a graduate student at the local college, had very little idea he meant so much to the old woman. He would alway show up after his last class during the week to sit with her, talk to her, check up on her, just generally make sure everthing was ok. Usually he'd bring so groceries and magazines for her since she couldn't get out of the house much herself. And even though Mark had been connected to Prudence though a &quot;care for the elderly&quot; program it really made the old girl feel special. If Prudy didn't know better she  would say she's falling in love with Mark. but that would be unacceptable. Mark was a really handsome young man, with a great personality and a bright future. But she was an old old woman who was alive before his granparents were born. She was just happy she was able to have Mark in these last few years of her life. 
<br />
Almost three. Subconciously she freshened herself up and straighted her gray hair. She picked out a nice dress for her to wear. 'Just looking presentable for company' she thought to herself as she checked the mirror for the forth time. Then the clock. It wa already a few minutes past. She was getting anxious. As she was heading out of her bedroom she heard the door ring. Using her cane to get to her walker, then using her walker to get to the door. She couldn't believe how excited she was. 
<br />
Mark waited outside the door. He understood at her age it took her a bit of time to get to the door. Finally her heard the knob turning. He smiled to greet Mrs. O'Donnell but was shocked to see the woman that answered the door was a beautifully stunning redhead in her early to mid twenties. However she was grasping a walker in her young hands and wearing a formless old fasion dress. Her curvacious body was quite obvious though. He stuttered not quite knowing what to say. &quot;H-h-hello....&quot; he began. &quot;Hello mark, how nice it is to see you!&quot; She said noting it odd that her voice didn't quaver as usual. it sounded so much more life like. &quot;I'm sorry&quot; Mark began, very confused. &quot;I'm here to see Mrs. O'Donnell?&quot; He couldn't help but think how beautiful this woman was and how he hoped she was going to be here more often. &quot;Oh Mark, It's m-&quot; She looked down at her hands, her smooth unwrinkled hands. And her chest with firm perky breasts. Her eyes were wide with amazement. &quot;oh my, oh my god! I'm young! I'm....&quot; She grabbed Mark and pulled him inside. the walker and the cane were discarded and so was the granny gown eventually. As Mark and Prudy frantically made out as young couples often do.
