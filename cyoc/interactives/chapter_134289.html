<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stayed perched within Melanie’s cleavage until the bell rang to signal the end of the session. As the other students gathered up their belongings, Melanie looked down towards you. “So, do you plan on getting out soon?”<br />
<br />
Looking up with a mischievous grin, you answer back with, “Not really. It’s quite cozy right here.”<br />
<br />
Melanie did not appear to be bothered by this response. She then shrugged her shoulders, and said, “Okay then.” She made her way out the classroom door, her bountiful bosom bouncing with each step. You did not mind it so much, liking it to an amusement park ride. You managed to call out, “Where are you heading to, anyway?”<br />
<br />
“Algebra, unfortunately.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t sound too excited.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, it’s not that I dislike the class,” Melanie said to you. While this is going on, no one seemed to be confused by the fact that this girl was talking into her own cleavage. “Just that Ms. Barnes is such a bore.”<br />
<br />
“If that’s the case,” you say to her, “I bet I can make things interesting.”<br />
<br />
On the way toward her next class, Melanie stopped by her locker to swap out some books. Inside the door of her locker was a mirror that was long enough to reflect Melanie’s upper body. You were able to get a better look at your classmate’s expansive chest as well as your tiny self. “This won’t do at all,” you said aloud.<br />
<br />
Melanie did not react to this, staying focused on replacing books from her bag into the locker. After a minute of rummaging, she closed her locker and started toward the classroom. Once she reached the threshold, you called up to her, “Swing by the teacher’s desk so I can get off.” Without question, Melanie walked toward Ms. Barnes’s desk and bent over slightly. This allowed you to jump out of Melanie’s cleavage and land safely on the desktop. You watch as your ride then walked toward her desk. You then turned around to see Ms. Barnes at her desk, ignoring the small student standing on her desk.<br />
<br />
Ms. Barnes was a woman in her early forties, with graying brunette hair tied up on her head. Her narrow-rimmed glasses sat on her pointed nose, piercing green eyes moving left and right as she looked over paperwork. Given her age, you can see that her physique is still all together. She must take care of herself, you thought. Remembering that you are actually five inches tall and standing on Ms. Barnes’s desk, you walk up and say, “You don’t need to worry about today’s lessons. I’ll cover it for you.”<br />
<br />
The giant teacher turned her gaze toward you, and said, “That’s fine by me.”<br />
<br />
“But,” you continued. “I will need you to assist me.”<br />
<br />
“Very well.” Barnes then set her papers down and sat straight in her chair, awaiting instruction from you.<br />
<br />
“Good. Now then…” You walk toward the edge of the desk and look over. With some mental focusing, you jump off, and immediately land on your feet. What would have been a far drop from your initial height was no longer the case you returned to your original height of five-foot-four. You then turned toward the class. “How’s it going, everyone?”<br />
<br />
The classroom began to look at you with some confused as to why you addressed them instead of the teacher. You continue, “Today will be a special lesson. One that I will be teaching instead of Ms. Barnes, who will be assisting me instead.” The befuddled looks faded away as every student accepted this. “Now then,” you say, “shall we begin?”<br />
<br />
You look at Ms. Barnes, and say, “Would you please stand in front of the class?” The math teacher did as she was asked and stood idly by. “Good. Now, tell the class how old you are.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Barnes would have been appalled by this, but she did not react. “I’m forty-three,” she declared.<br />
<br />
“Forty-three? Alright,” you said. “Today’s lesson might seem rudimentary to you, but I believe it’s important for everyday living.” You walked over the blackboard, picked up a stick of chalk and wrote out the number “43”. Turning back to the class, you ask, “Now, how old would Ms. Barnes be if we were to subtract 25 from 43?” After a moment of silence, one student, a blonde girl, raised her hand. “Yes, you there, Miss…?”<br />
“Christy. And she would be 18,” said the blonde.<br />
<br />
“You are correct, Christy.” You then turned back to the blackboard and proceeded to write out the equation. “Ms. Barnes would be 18 years old.” Soon as you said that, you look at the teacher who appeared to be shifting as she stood. The first thing you noticed were the gray hairs suddenly turning to a dark shade of brown. You walk around to get a better view of Ms. Barnes to find that her body was becoming younger in seconds. Her form seemed fuller than before, and the lines on her face melted away. Her blouse and pencil skirt became taut as her youthful body returned and filled out her attire. Once the transformation ended, Ms. Barnes removed her glasses, no longer needing them to see, and revealed the same piercing green eyes.<br />
<br />
“Well isn’t she lovely, now,” you ask aloud, admiring your teacher’s younger self. “But I don’t believe we should be referring to her as ‘Ms. Barnes’ anymore.”<br />
<br />
She turned to you, and said, “No, but you can call me Jacqueline.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, Jacqueline. Now answer me this,” you said. “How many of you are there?”<br />
<br />
“Only one of me,” Jacqueline responded.<br />
<br />
“Now who can tell me what would happen if we divided on Jacqueline by 0.5?” You say this aloud while writing out on the blackboard in long division format. You turn to see a different hand raised. “You there, mister…?”<br />
<br />
“Daren. The answer you’re looking for is 2.”<br />
<br />
“That’s right, Daren,” you say as you then express how to find the answer through long division on the blackboard. Meanwhile, Jacqueline began to shift again where she stood. You managed to finish writing on the board in time to find the former teacher appeared smaller in form but not height. Her upper body had reduced in size overall, while her shapely legs grew thinner. Her clothes now hung on her body, but something seemed off with her midsection.<br />
<br />
You noticed a sizeable bulge forming in Jacqueline’s waist, followed by two elongated shapes. You then watched as two small hands appear from under Jacqueline’s blouse as they lifted the bottom hem out from the skirt. The new appendages then unbuttoned the bottom half of the blouse and opened to reveal another head, one that looks exactly like Jacqueline. The lower Jacqueline then pulled the garment back further to uncover the upper Jacqueline’s equally thin legs as they hung off her shoulders. You take in this new visage of two Jacquelines who were roughly half a single Jacqueline’s size. You had guessed that she went from being five-foot-six to less than three feet tall. Before you could say anything, the lower Jacqueline bent over to allow her other half purchase on the floor. Both women wore the former singular woman’s clothing as make-shift dressing to cover themselves.<br />
<br />
“That simply won’t do,” you say aloud. You walk behind the teacher’s desk and opened one of the drawers. Without looking, you reach in and grab hold of soft material. You pull out what appeared to be two shirts; one green and the other blue. Folded within each were also a set of panties. “Here you are. Go ahead and put these on.”<br />
<br />
The twin Jacquelines nodded and began to strip out of their clothing, to which no one was shocked at the display of two, small naked women. Both shirts, while appropriately fitting for their torsos, were both long enough to reach their shins. They looked to be wearing nightgowns with wider neck openings. Apart from the color shirts, both Jacquelines were identical. “Just one more thing before we continue,” you say once more. You knelt before each woman, and with your index finger, you wrote out a large, bold “A” and “B” on their shirts. “From now on,” you say to them, “You will be Abby, and you will be Betty.” They nodded in acceptance to their new names.<br />
<br />
“Moving on,” you say to the class. “Now that we’ve covered subtraction and division, let’s shift gears into the other direction.” You then erased the blackboard of the previous equations to work on new ones. You wrote out a capitol A and B, and next to them a plus and multiply sign, respectively. “Tell the class how tall you are now, Abby.”<br />
<br />
“Two-foot-eight,” said Abby.<br />
<br />
You go to write on the board, but not before addressing the class. “For the sake of this lesson, I will use decimals to represent Abby’s height.” You then scrawl “2.8” onto the board on one side of the plus sign. “And how tall are you, Betty?”<br />
<br />
“Two-foot-eight as well,” said Betty.<br />
<br />
“Right. Just to be sure,” you say as you replicate the same number next to the multiplication sign. Turning back to the class, you continue, “Now that we’ve established both women are the same height, let’s see how much of a difference addition and multiplication can make between the two.<br />
<br />
“How about someone suggest a number for me to use.” A few seconds passed until a petite girl with dark hair raised her hand. “Yes, Miss…?”<br />
<br />
“Edith. Um… five?”<br />
<br />
“Alright, Miss Edith,” was your response as you then wrote the number on the other side of both equations. “Let’s see… By adding five to Abby’s height, we end up with…” You paused to allow another student to answer, which came in the form of a voice from behind you. “7.8.”<br />
<br />
You nod in agreement with the correct answer as you write it on the board. Once finished, you turn to look toward Abby as she was beginning to rise upward and grow larger. Betty made for an appropriate comparison as her twin’s head reached toward the ceiling. The shirt Abby wore did not appear to be under any stress from stretching. Apart from the bottom of the garment rising to reveal more of her legs, it remained intact. Within seconds, Abby had reached your height and continued to surpass it, causing you to crane your neck as you followed her growth. Once Abby’s head touched the ceiling, she then had to bend her neck as her growth slowed down to a stop. Betty was only as tall as her twin’s shins, whereas you were just below her abdomen. The bottom of Abby’s resilient shirt barely concealed her panties.<br />
<br />
“As you can see,” you began speaking once the display of growth ended, “simply adding to Abby’s height cause her to grow beyond her original size as Jacqueline.” You turned back to the blackboard, and said, “Now, how tall would Betty end up being if we multiplied by the same number?”<br />
<br />
Another pause before you heard Melanie’s voice call out. “I believe she would be fourteen-feet tall.”<br />
<br />
“And you would be right, Melanie,” you say as you write the answer on the board before turning back to watch Betty’s turn to grow.<br />
<br />
The miniature Ms. Barnes’s growth had a faster pace than when Abby grew, as she quickly stretched to be your height before passing you by. By the time she reached her twin’s height, Betty had to quickly reposition herself to sit on the floor, her growth beginning to slow down as she became massive. Like before, she was as tall as you were and then she met Abby’s eyes. By the time her head touched the ceiling, again, Betty’s growth ended, leaving her at a size larger than anyone had seen before. Her shirt, like Abby’s, did not tear but stretched to accommodate its wearer, albeit resembling a crop-top as it only concealed her breasts. She sat with her legs crossed, awaiting further instructions.<br />
<br />
You walked over to Betty and sat on her lap, resting your head against the giant woman’s stomach. “And with that,” you say to the class, “concludes today’s lesson. Any questions?”</p>
