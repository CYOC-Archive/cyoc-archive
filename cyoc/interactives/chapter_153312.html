<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I would say the baby should be the person with the same interest, therefore I think that you, Jeremy, are the best playmate Aidan could get out of your group.&quot; While the other six looked a bit calmer not to end as a baby, Jeremy looked horrified and speechless at Mark and Aidans mental threats increased. He looked Jeremys profile over.<br />
<br />
Name: Jeremy Smith<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Age: 27 years, 4 months<br />
Height: 5ft 7 inches<br />
Weight: 157 pounds<br />
Hair: Blond<br />
Eyes: Blue<br />
Orientation: Heterosexual<br />
Skin: Light Olive<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But that needs preparations, just like Aidan had some. Jeremy, your two favorite sets of shirts, jeans and caps beside the clothes you wear will appear before you together with all shoes you own but seven pairs at most.&quot;<br />
Aidan knows already what Mark would do but that didn´t help Jeremy in any way. But only two shirts and jeans appeared together with four pairs of shoes.  Jeremy didn´t wear any caps so he doesn´t own any. Not that that would stop Mark.<br />
He turned to Geoff: &quot;Do you have any caps around?&quot; &quot;Yeah, on top of the closet in my bedroom, why?&quot; But Mark simply went over to his bedroom to get three of the caps. He had forgotten that he would need one for the actual set of clothes as well, but seeing that Jeremy didn´t own any they wouldn´t have appeared any way. He put them next to clothes before looking at the brothers: &quot;As for the missing two pairs of shoes I want both John and Jack to remove the ones you wear at the moment and toss them over.&quot; Both could do nothing as their bodies removed their shoes without hesitation. <br />
Jeremy looked at the gathered clothes before he asked: &quot;What do you need the clothes for? Their shoes wouldn´t fit me anyway, they are to big.&quot;<br />
&quot;You will know in a minute, but now I want you to strip everything you wear at the moment beside your underwear off, Jeremy.&quot; Jeremy looked horrified as his body began to strip. But as unwilling as he was he couldn´t stop until he stood there in only his underwear and a deep blush. But the others weren´t laughing at him for now.<br />
&quot;Now I want that underwear of yours to change into a big diaper, with didn´t leak and is self-cleaning after you finished using it every time. After the diaper is in place you will lose every control you have on your bladder and bowels. That will set the diaper in a test-run.&quot; Mark said smiling while Jeremy looked a mix between turning white in shock and blushing deep red in embarrassment. His underwear bloated in size, hiding more skin than the simple underwear had before and became thicker by the filling material. When it stopped changing he all of the sudden lost everything inside his bladder and bowels, filling it rather quickly. Jeremys skin had gained a dark red sheen of embarrassment when Jack started laughing at the sight, John joining in a second later while the rest remained quiet.<br />
When he had finished emptying the diaper turned white and normal again, no sign of his forced accident. Jeremy didn´t say his thoughts out loud about the laughing man beside him, but Mark did so for him: &quot;You two think it is funny? You know, why not let you have the same experience then. You both will lose control of your bladder and bowels like Jeremy had, but in contrast to him you will not wear a diaper, therefore will mess your underwear and jeans. And when finished it will slowly be absorbed into the underwear, the smell will stay within it. Should your piss leak into your jeans they will absorb it slowly also and keep the smell, but your shit will be locked inside your underwear until its absorbed.&quot;<br />
Both Jack and John looked at Mark horrified when they two let all lose, soaking their underwear. Because their shit was locked inside their underwear and only slowly absorbed they could feel it around their ass, squished and displeasing them. While Jeremy didn´t laugh at them he felt a deep satisfaction that Mark took revenge for him. But Mark turned back to him.<br />
&quot;Now I want you to put back on your jeans, then your shoes, after that you put your shirt back on and fix one of the caps on your head, sun protection to the front. When that all is in place you will put Jacks shoes on your hands.&quot;<br />
While Jeremys body did this Jack and Johns flow stopped, but the feeling kept in place for a couple of minutes. They both were now as deep red as Jeremy had been before. Jeremy was meanwhile trying to understand what Mark needed the shoes on his hands for.<br />
When all was in place Mark continued: &quot;Now the shoes on your feet will turn into baby booties and keep their design while the ones on your hands turn into mittens. The cap will turn into a hood but keep the sun protection. After that the booties, the mittens and the hood will fuse with your shirt and jeans, forming an big yellow onesie with something decorating them on you. The same changes will apply to the other two sets of your clothing and Geoffs caps, changing into an orange and  a purple onesie, also with something decorating them in other colors. They will all be self-cleaning and self-repairing. The shoes from John will get fasteners instead of shoelaces and blinking lights while gain a bright light blue color. Finally they will become the size to fit around your onesies booties.&quot;<br />
The others looked helpless at Jeremys situation. Jacks former shoes shrunk down on Jeremys hands, encasing them and made him unable to grab anything with them. All clothes turned softer while merging into one big yellow onesie with colorful stars and suns. The orange one gained various letters and numbers while the purple one gained clouds and ice-crystals. Johns former shoes turned into replicas of the one Aidan was wearing in the stroller only in blue instead of yellow and a couple of sizes bigger before they jumped on Jeremys feet, fixing themselves on them.<br />
“Now you look like a bigger yellow version of Aidan, Jeremy. Only missing an replica of that bib and the pacifier.” commented Daniel, smiling a bit. Jeremy didn´t look as happy through. “Do you really believe I would wear something like this willingly, Daniel? It´s comfortable, I gave it that much, but I hate it. If I could I would kick Mark in his ass, hoping that this shoes hurt him really much.”<br />
Mark laughed at that. “You know, Aidan also wasn´t happy at that point. But he was disciplined after this point. With you I will wait with that a bit longer.” With that he took the discarded socks from Jeremy up, making gestures too show that the stink. “Have you forgotten to wash them, Jeremy? They stink as if they hadn´t for a week. But maybe you like it that way. This sock will change into your new bib Jeremy. It will keep the smell just for you, others will think its a freshly washed bib.” Mark explained grinning. The smell of the socks intensified while one changed into a light green bib with a rocket motive on it. It wrapped itself to Jeremys neck, letting him wrinkle his nose.<br />
“That was you who intensified that smell, Mark, they were fresh. You don´t believe I will use that anytime? The first possibility I get I will mmhhhh...” Jeremys comment was stopped when Mark shoved the balled sock into his open mouth. “You won´t spit it out. That sock will turn into your new pacifier. And like the bib it will keep that smell and taste just for you, others see it as new. And you will suck on it out of reflex, but never get used to said taste and smell. Finally only others can remove it, but when you don´t have it in and someone holds it near your mouth you will take it back in without hesitation.”<br />
Jeremy looked as if he would strangle Mark if he could while he gagged on the sock. To his horror he started sucking even before it started changing into a big green pacifier, nearly letting him go crazy.</p>
