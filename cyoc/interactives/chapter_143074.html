<br />
&quot;Thanks for doing this, Dan,&quot; a thick, stout, Korean beefcake smiled at Dan the half-bull, &quot;I&#39;m <br />
Sebastian, I&#39;ll be MC&#39;ing the event.&quot; Dressed in sequined short-shorts, vest and top hat, Sebastian made Dan smile with his flamboyant attitude. &quot;Alright, cub, it&#39;s starting...&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sebastian burst onto the stage to cheers and growls from a packed stadium, “GOOOOOOOOD Evening, Bears, Bulls, Cubs, and all the gentlemen in-between.”  Sebastian turned on his heel, daintily clutching his microphone while he gestured at five hulking silhouettes. “Before I introduce this year’s prize, let’s meet our contestants...these are your campus alphas” Sebastian waited for cheers and growls to die down, “the most dominant men on campus, captains of their sport, Valedictorian, or simply the BIGGEST” a particularly large silhouette let out a whimper.<br />
<br />
The spotlight split from Sebastian and illuminated the first massive brute.  “Standing at 7’8” with 30” arms, its the captain of our powerlifting team, PATRICK!”  The massive redhead strutted forward to cheers, flexing his massive arms to moans, and bucking his hips so his massive cock and balls would peak from under his too-short kilt.<br />
<br />
“Now, I understand you’ve already met Dan,” Sebastian peered from his notecards up to the massively muscled redhead.<br />
<br />
“That’s right,” Patricks’ cock stiffened at the thought of Dan...truth be told, he was obsessed with Dan.  “That handsome bull is going to see why I’m the most alpha.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll see about that, big guy...I think contestant number two has you beat for looks.”  Sebastian remarked coyly, his tone was biting and catty.  As the spotlight illuminated the second contestant, the crowd let out a mix of laughs and claps.<br />
<br />
“ALSO standing at 7’8” with 30” arms, its Patrick’s identical twin brother, MARCUS!” The massive redhead fixed his glasses before stepping forward, wearing a matching kilt of their family tartan.  “Where Patrick is easily the strongest man on campus, Marcus is the undisputed Valedictorian.  Do you think you’ll beat your brother?”<br />
<br />
Marcus grinned, “A win for Patty is a win for me--we’re used to sharing” to emphasize the point, Marcus affectionately rubbed his twins’ backside.<br />
<br />
The spotlight split again, revealing contestant number three.  “Standing at 6’8” with the deepest, biggest, thickest pecs on campus, its the captain of our undefeated Water Polo team, ADRIAN!”  A group of water polo studs started chanting his name, only sitting down when the cheering and clapping stopped.<br />
<br />
Adrian was freshly shaven, his thickly muscled body completely smooth.  A lifetime of waterpolo had given him a ripped physique, but in a universe where everyone was a massive musclebear, his abs looked like bricks over a distended roid gut.<br />
<br />
“Adrian, is it true you’re roommates with Dan?”  Sebastian asked the question to Adrian’s overflowing speedo, too distracted by his 25” cock to look up at his clean-shaven, masculine face.<br />
<br />
“Up here, Sebby.”  Adrian flexed his cock, making Sebastian stumble and the crowd laugh.  “We only met each other today...but I intend on spending the rest of my life with him.”  Adrian said confidently, adjusting his package.  Like anyone who had met Dan, he was completely obsessed and falling deeper the more he thought of about that dark bull.<br />
<br />
“Which brings us to our next contestant…”  The crowd hushed as the largest silhouette on stage lit up.  “...despite being the biggest lug on campus, he’s almost too submissive to function, its MAGNUS!”  The giant tried to slink back into the shadows, but Sebastian was quick to pull him out onto the stage.<br />
<br />
Magnus was impossibly huge.  Taller than Patrick and Marcus, and about as wide as the two together. His body was so packed with bloated muscle that it jiggled slightly as he moved. His gut was incredible...a perfect sphere of muscle and fat extending a yard from his body. The weight of it forced Magnus to arch his back in balance, which only made him look more massive. <br />
<br />
Magnus was covered in a dense carpet of platinum blond hair, trailing over his legs, gut, chest and forearms...it looked incredible on his deeply-tanned skin with light freckles filling in the bare spaces over his shoulders and back. He was the only bear on stage with bangs and hair long enough to braid into a ponytail, pulled tight and braided to match his beard. Even his eyelashes and eyebrows were a stark blond...it was strangely exotic...like Magnus was a Norse God.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, big guy--&quot; Sebastian poked his microphone at Magnus &quot;--give the crowd a double-bicep pose!&quot; The crowd cheered...but Magnus, unlike the other contestants, was unsure how to proceed. He blushed hard, clearly embarrassed by the attention. Sheepishly, he brought his arms up, flexing quickly before bringing them back to rest, pushed out by his massive lats. He gulped, looking down...the woofs and clapping were overwhelming...<br />
<br />
Despite his incredible size and handsome features, Magnus was a chronic introvert, and nearly too submissive to function. He knew he wouldn&#39;t have the Alpha-attitude to win, but this was the closest Magnus had ever been to Dan, the love of his life.<br />
<br />
“Annnnnd for our last contestant, standing three-feet soft,” the crowd let out some chuckles, “And 7-feet-tall even, its the captain of our football team, JETT!”  The cocky redhead sauntered forward wearing a pair of lace-up football shorts that barely contained his cock and ass...his massive gut pushed over the waistband. <br />
<br />
“WE LOVE YOU, MASTER JETT!” His team of bulls drowned out the cheering with moos and cries of total devotion and adoration.<br />
<br />
Jett gave the crowd a flex, but didn’t quite get as much attention as the other campus alphas.  He needed to completely dominate the other alphas to win a date with Dan, but the lackluster applause made him feel uncertain about victory.<br />
<br />
Sebastian snapped his fingers and the lights left the alpha bears and focused on him.  “Now that you’ve met our alpha bears, let’s meet the bull of the hour: DAN!”. Sebastian swished stage left where Dan was seated, pulling off his sound cancelling ear muffs.<br />
<br />
With all attention on the opposite side of the stage, Jett pulled out the tablet and entered a new command to ensure his victory:<br />
<br />
>> JETT WILL CHANGE TO BE THE BEST ANSWER FOR ANY QUESTION THAT DAN ASKS<br />
<br />
Jett hit “SAVE” and watched the air ripple around him as he stashed the tablet offstage.<br />
<br />
“Dan, you are just adora-BULL!”  Sebastian had the crowd cheering and whistling at Dan onstage, wearing just a jockstrap that framed his thick bubble butt and pushed his heavy package forward.  “Dan, its only your first day on campus and it seems like EVERYONE is talking about the hot piece of beef.”  <br />
<br />
Dan was blushing, looking down and clopping his hoof.  When he programmed the chronovac to make him irresistible, he didn’t realize how intense the effect would be.  Nobody could take their eyes off of him. Truth be told, he enjoyed feeling like a piece of meat.<br />
<br />
“Here’s how the Alpha Bear competition works, bully boy.”  Sebastian pointed to a wall separating Him and Dan from the five alpha bears.  “Since you’re new, you don’t know who the campus alphas are yet.  We’ll be keeping their identities secret by putting them behind that wall.”<br />
<br />
Dan had a pretty good feeling he knew who was competing, but everyone had such deep, intense voices, it would be hard to identify them from just listening.<br />
<br />
“Each round you’ll ask the alpha’s some salacious questions that we’ve written for you.  At the end of the questions, you’ll pick who THE MOST Alpha amongst alphas, and he will win a date with you.”<br />
<br />
Dan wiggled, letting out an excited moo.  “I’m ready!”<br />
<br />
Sebastian sashayed over to the alpha bears, “Ready, boys?”<br />
<br />
“READY!” They let out a roar in confirmation, sending the crowd cheering.<br />
<br />
Dan lifted the first card, reading in a slightly slow, not-fluid pace.  “Hey, Alphas. I want to get this out of the way first: how big is your cock?”  The crowd cheered and roared with laughter while Sebastian turned to the first contestant, Patrick.<br />
<br />
“I’m 26 inches long and uncut.”  Said Patrick.  <br />
His twin Marcus leaned in to follow, “I’m also 26 inches and uncut.”<br />
<br />
Jett felt his cock swelling, lengthening and thickening to be bigger than Patrick and Marcus.  His shorts shimmered, adjusting to keep his 3-foot-long cock barely contained.<br />
<br />
“25 inches here, and cut!” Adrian adjusted his package through his speedo.<br />
<br />
“Oh...uh…”  Magnus blushed beat red, stepping forward and pushing his package out.  “4-feet long…”  The other competitors’ jaws dropped as Magnus hefted out his oversized cock, nearly reaching the floor.  Suddenly realizing all eyes were on him, he turned quickly, struggling to tuck his meat back in his compression shorts.<br />
<br />
Jett’s eyes went wide, watching his cock gain another two feet to stay bigger than Magnus.  He stifled a moan, feeling it hit the floor, coiling in on itself.<br />
<br />
“Geeze...5 feet long, I reckon?” Jett hefted his cock, releasing it to a loud wet flop. His team of bulls moo&#39;d with delight, while the crowd rooting for Jett seemed to grow with the rest of him.<br />
<br />
Dan shivered thinking about a cock that was nearly as big as he was tall.  “N-Next question!”  He stammered, blushing when he read the next card.  “What’s the biggest thing about you?”<br />
<br />
Patrick flexed, “I’m the strongest at this school--” Jett’s body flexed, he could feel his muscles growing denser in response, the air around him rippling “--right after Alpha Contestant number 5.”<br />
<br />
Marcus fixed his glasses, “Its not necessarily syntactically correct, but I am Valedictorian and therefore BIGGEST in academia--” Jett felt a rush, his mind flooding with knowledge, sharpening, growing smarter and more witty “--right up there with Alpha Contestant number 5.”<br />
<br />
Adrian adjusted his overflowing speedo, “The rumours are true, I am the biggest horndog on campus. My sex drive is so high I have to get off every hour, on the hour.”<br />
<br />
Sebastian interjected, “Hey, could be worse, your sex drive isn’t so bad you have to cum every 10-minutes, like Contestant number 5.”  Jett groaned, feeling his balls swell and inch larger, his cock throbbing free from his shorts.  He could hear his team of bulls whimpering and moaning...no doubt they helped him with this in the new reality.<br />
<br />
Magnus gulped, braiding his beard nervously, “I...I’m not that big or anythi--”<br />
<br />
This time Sebastian cut him off, “Magnus, you’re certainly not up here for being an assertive Alpha-type.”  Sebastian tugged Magnus’ compression pants down, “You’re up here because you’re the absolute biggest guy on campus!”  Magnus blushed, trying to pull his pants up.  “8-foot-8, bigger than our first two contestants combined, even your beard is huge!”<br />
<br />
Magnus tried his best to shrink down, shy from all the attention, “T-That’s not completely true, I’m only the second largest…”<br />
<br />
Jett moaned, feeling his growth come to a stop.  Stronger, smarter, super-charged-sex-drive, and now he was taller, thicker, and more hung than everyone before him.  “Fuck…” Jett said breathlessly, trying to peer past his massive pecs.  Magnus was down by his shoulders...he must be over 9-feet-tall.  And his cock was so big it hung off the stage. “I have a big heart?”<br />
<br />
The crowd shared “awes,” Jett’s contingent bigger than ever, people holding up signs cheering the giant redhead on.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Alphas,” Dan continued, “What exactly makes you so dominant?”<br />
<br />
As each contestant shared a personal story illustrating how dominant they are, Jett felt his own dominance grow stronger, like they were adding to his own.  After Patrick and Marcus, Jett was so dominant he could lock eyes with strangers in the crowd and make them cum.  After Adrian went, Jett’s dominance swelled even more, people in the audience struggled to look directly at him.  For Jett, it almost felt like he could sense the submissive need of those around him...an aching, longing pain tightening in the chest. When he focused on it he swore he could control it, rendering those in the front row powerless.<br />
<br />
“For reasons, we’re skipping Magnus.”  Sebastian continued along to Jett, towering above the other contestants, his cock hard and pumping pre into the first row, every breath sounding like a growl and sending shivers down Sebastian&#39;s back.  “A-And how about y-you, contestant number f-five?”  Sebastian stammered as he approached Jett, the massive, hyper dominant, overly hung, captain of the all-bull football team.  The redhead was drunk with his dominance, and for good reason...nobody could say “no” to him, he was fiercely intelligent, a literal giant, everyone wanted to serve and worship him...his football team had so many extra players, they had three standby teams!<br />
<br />
Instead of a response, Jett just growled.  It was a deep, powerful, rumbling growl that seemed to resonate at the same frequency as heartache.  If you were in earshot, your knees buckled, cock stiffened, and felt a need to serve the owner of that voice.  The stadium filled with needy, longing whimpers and orgasmic moans.<br />
<br />
Even Dan struggled, moaning over the microphone as he came onto himself.<br />
<br />
“Good, bull.”  Jett growled again, eliciting a whimper from Dan, who shivered and tried to collect himself before reading the next card.</p>
