<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ty basked in the afterglow of his impregnation he decided to get a better view of his little bundle of joy showing him a vision of the embryo growing inside his womb. At this point being just fertilized the baby wasn’t more than a few cells rapidly dividing into a small sphere but to Ty it was the most beautiful thing in the world it is her baby. It was at this moment Ty referred to herself in the feminine which she first thought was weird until she gave more time to the idea, why shouldn’t she refer to herself as feminine she was doing the one thing no man can do create a person in her own body and to hell to anyone says otherwise she is this baby’s mother no matter what. Ty has alway been fascinated by parenthood especially mothers how they love a person so dearly they give up months of there life to give them life and then years after for care and wellbeing. To receive, give or feel even a fraction of the amount of love that relationship has alway been Ty’s dream and now although not how she originally envision it she was going to be a parent. As Ty giggled with excitement her adulation was soon turn to worry as she needed so many things in order to take care of a child, she needed to check schools, she needed to think of what to do if it’s a boy or a girl like names, room decoration, toys. Then a most horrendous thought occurred what would her foster family think, would they force her to give it, let her keep it but abuse her child like her or worse make her have an abortion. Even the thought was too much to bear, Ty quickly put on some clothes and very swiftly left the house without even a sound. Ty just walked as far as she could from that house with only the clothes on her back that being a pairs of boxers, socks and sneakers, some sweatpants and a t-shirt but that didn’t matter no one was touching her baby not Mark and June, not CPS, and definitely not Dustin. Luckily it was a sunny day as Ty thought what to do next first off Ty realized she needed to change her body in order to take care of not only herself but more importantly her baby. First thing her lower body although possible to birth with the equipment she now possess it would probably be a highly uncomfortable experience with a good chance of a medical hazard to occur and she was not yet comfortable enough with her new powers to know if she could concentrate enough during birth for safe delivery so to stop a problem from ever happening her legs, hips and ass would need adjustment. As she walked she could feel her legs growing in length gaining a few inches while her feet, calves and thighs shrunk and grew to more fair, smooth, curvy proportions forming a pair of appendages that were quiet flexible and strong. As her legs finished Ty felt a sudden pop in her right hip quickly followed by her left soon realizing her stride as changed now slightly swaying her hips for the sudden widening of her hips to help allow for far more easier delivery with her ass quickly filling out to match her thighs and hips as to help keep her balance. With her lower body complete Ty contemplate what to change next knowing she wants to breast feed she decided to change her torso starting with her waist as it condensed into a hourglass shape next her shoulders shrunk into a more refined shape decreasing some of her new acquired height which caused her once masculine arms to grow slimmer and longer with the hands becoming smaller and refined. With her upper body now the proper size Ty focus on the trait she wanted as the muscles in her chest soften and inflate turning into milk producing breast tissue, perfect for feeding her infant when desiring food, they grew to a modest C-cup but Ty suspects they will grow further as her pregnancy progresses. At this point Ty resemble the gender of her initial transformation than her original sex all that remain is her head and that too was rapidly changing as Ty thought what kind of face she wanted her child to see a face that matched the body she has while also gentle and kind. All the rough lines and textures of the natural male smoothed over leaving behind a smooth neck granting a sweet and melodic voice, full soft cheeks and lips to give the most loving snuggles and kisses, her eyes turned from dull brown to vivid verdant green and her short hair brown grew into a cascade of chestnut strains braided into a loose single Dutch style. As Ty finished her gender transformation she soon realized she may be too young to give birth knowing teenage pregnancy can cause all sorts of health issues for the child and mother and considering she was already surrendering her previous life for this child what were a few years as Ty’s young teen face lost some of its childhood youth but kept all its gentleness and kindness while gaining some aged wisdom, her body soon reflected this as she grew a few inches, her breasts, hips and thighs grew a bit larger and any remaining youth weight had disappeared giving way to an adult grace. With the last physical change Ty decided to change her name as she was not him anymore and her baby deserved better than a lazy horny teen. Where once 15 year old gangly teenage boy Ty had now turn into 23 year old graceful expecting mother Teresa. Teresa continued walking thinking what else she needed for her new life coming to the conclusion that she wanted a house for her child to grow up in, she also wanted a small town environment a place where it isn’t a backwater but still small enough that it doesn’t warrant any attention from outside it small community. As Teresa thought of this the sidewalk slowly turned into the town she imagined with beautiful large house filled with happy families where her child will make friends best part it as far as she could get from her Foster family where they now have to explain where the teen in their care has disappeared to. It was at that time that Teresa came to her house a lovely two story building with three bedrooms, two baths, large lawn with full kitchen, dinning room and living room, a place that Teresa has made a whole backstory for. She is Teresa Summers her parents sadly died when she was young but luckily for her gave her a sizable inheritance and house in their wills to her where she doesn’t has to worry about work and focus on her child, a child she has wanted for as long as she could remember and thanks to IVF technology has now granted said wish, according to the town’s people Teresa didn’t care where they thought the baby came from but it would give her the most peace. As Teresa entered her home she made her way to the master bedroom where she striped her clothes off, the last remnants of Ty from her body the few pieces of clothes disappearing before they even hit the floor whereupon she took a quick shower exploring her body as she cleaned and after finding a nice blue sundress to enjoy the rest of the afternoon on the porch waving at her neighbors while she excitedly await her baby to show signs of its progress, for her belly to protrude into a magnificent sphere, to feel it move inside her and finally to hold when she gives birth. As these thoughts ran through her mind she thought what else her baby needed, should find a boyfriend or girlfriend to be a second parent, go it alone as a single mother, accelerate her child’d growth, just enjoy the day worry about that for another day.</p>
