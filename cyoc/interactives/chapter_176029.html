<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Brandon got back to his high rise he set about checking the serum and the injector. It seemed simple enough, even more so than the steroid shots he had been giving himself for years to keep his physique against the ravages of aging. He pressed the injector up against his neck and pulled the trigger. There was a small pinch and then the feeling of something warm flowing into him. He thought he could feel it coursing through his body.<br />
<br />
Setting down the injector he flipped open the journal and logged the time of the injection. He&#39;d humor Jannes with this little journal, after all, he didn&#39;t know if he would need the doctor for anymore treatments. He turned the TV on, flipping through the channels until something caught his interest, wrestling. It would do. He let it play in the background as he got his dinner and a beer to settle in for the evening.<br />
<br />
Two hours and three beers later, Brandon was feeling pretty good. He didn&#39;t know if it was the alcohol or some weird side effect of the serum but he felt just a bit light headed. He was also way more into the wrestling on the TV than he normally would be, not because he liked the fights, no, these guys were what men should be.. big, buff, strong. It was good to see them strutting their hard earned bodies across the screen in their skimpy spandex outfits.<br />
<br />
Brandon&#39;s hand started rubbing at the bulge in his pants. If only more guys were like that, put in the dedication like him and the guys on the screen. His fingers ran through a damp spot on his pants. God, he was horny. Hornier than he had been in a long time. Jannes did say there would be side effects, and hell, horniness was part of being young again, right? Maybe it was a good sign?<br />
<br />
He unzipped his pants, pushed his underwear down, and freed his stiff cock. It has always been his pride and joy, eight inches of solid iron. His eyes stayed glued to the sweaty, muscular men wrestling on the screen as he stroked his shaft, his thoughts drifting to being up in the ring with them, grappling, fighting, their bodies pressed together...<br />
<br />
He came. He came quick and hard. The orgasm left him shuddering, every muscle in his body clenching as his cock unloaded gush after gush of cum, splattering across his wooden floor and coffee table. It was like being twenty again. His cock softened but not all the way, a little work and he&#39;d be ready to...<br />
<br />
What had he just done?! Did he really just jack off to a bunch of sweaty men?! No.. it was the serum, it was just making him horny and he was getting off on the thought of being young and strong again. That had to be it. He reached forward to grab the napkin from his dinner to clean off his cock and froze.<br />
<br />
The head of his cock was black. Well.. not completely, but it was much darker than it had been. A deep dark brown with a slightly red tinge. He wiped at his cock head with the napkin. The cum came off, but the color wasn&#39;t some stain, it stayed. Then he noticed the hand holding the napkin, his finger tips were darker, too, like some strange form of frostbite. Except he was completely warm, they didn&#39;t hurt and he still had feeling in them. Nothing seemed off but their color.<br />
<br />
He started stripping as he headed towards the bathroom. He needed to take stock of what was going on. He needed to think. By the time he was standing in front of the mirror he was buck naked. Other than his cock head and his finger tips, only his toes showed the same strange coloring. He stuck his hands under the sink and tried to wash them. No luck, the staining stayed like it was. He cursed and looked up at his reflection for the third shock of the evening.<br />
<br />
He looked, well, younger. It wasn&#39;t much, but when you see your own face in the mirror every morning, you notice when things are off. In this case some of his wrinkles had smoothed out and his hairline had reversed it&#39;s retreat. Even with his hair treatments and transplants it was further back than it had been, but now it looked to be reversing course. Only..<br />
<br />
He pulled at a lock of hair, which straightened out as he did, only to pop back into the slight curl it had started in. Maybe it was thicker so it curled a bit instead of being it&#39;s usual straight style. Though plucking at his hair brought his attention back to his fingers. With an annoyed growl he stomped back out of the bathroom and found his phone. Punching in a number he waited through the rings, impatiently tapping his foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Jannes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jannes! Your serum it doing some weird shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you there could be some odd side effects. Just log it in the book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jannes! I want answers. Why is my c.. finger tips turning black.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Black? And numbness? Pain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No..&quot; Brandon could almost hear Jannes thinking on the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;s not an emergency, it&#39;s just an effect of the serum. Everything should settle down by the end. Record the changes. ALL the changes, and if you experience any pain call me.&quot; Jannes said all like he knew Brandon was having issues with more than just his finger tips. Then he hung up. He hung up! That scrawny nerd hung up on Brandon Whyte!<br />
<br />
Brandon gritted his teeth and got a hold of his temper. He wanted to throw that stupid journal out. That&#39;d show that pencil necked... but if he needed it in order to fix any problems? Brandon sighed and flipped it open, recording the time and the changes he had noticed so far. It was more a list than anything, but it would have to do.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt very weary. Maybe a little sleep would do him good. Even through his worry, he fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow. His dreams were filled with wrestling. He was in the ring, dressed only in a pair of lycra briefs and a pair of soft boots. He fought his opponent, the grappled, bodies pressed together, hot and sweaty until he finally managed to pin the other man. The bulge in his briefs pressed up against the other wrestlers muscular rear. He gyrated his hips a little, jerking himself off between those luscious globes..<br />
<br />
And woke to his cock shooting a load into his sheets. He hadn&#39;t had a wet dream since he was a teenager, and certainly not one like that. He crawled out of his sheets, deciding to go to the bathroom and maybe clean himself up before he worried about stripping the bed. He walked into the bathroom, still bleary eyed from sleep. He flicked on a light switch and squinted against the sudden bright glare, but made it over to the toilet. He grabbed his cock, waiting for his eyes to adjust so he could look down and aim, and nearly pissed himself in shock.<br />
<br />
It was black. Not just the head, his whole damn cock was black. It stuck out like an ebony spire from his pale crotch. Even his scrotum was a deep shade of black, and.. even through the shock Brandon thought the whole package looked bigger, or maybe that was just an illusion. The coloration had also creeped up his fingers, darkening his hands right up to just past his wrist, darker skin on the back, slightly paler on his palms. A quick check confirmed his feet were the same until just about his ankles. And his nipples! They had darkened to the same shade as his cock, standing out on his pale white chest like someone had drawn them on with a sharpie. He gave one a pinch, and no pain, in fact, it felt a little good. &quot;Focus, Brandon.&quot; He admonished himself.<br />
<br />
Was he? No.. he couldn&#39;t be..<br />
<br />
He looked into the mirror and his jaw dropped. His face looked off. Whatever was causing his skin to darken hadn&#39;t affected his face yet, but his nose and lips looked.. swollen? No, fuller? He brought his fingers up to his lips, checking to see if he wasn&#39;t just seeing things, then up to his nose and his somewhat flared nostrils. They were definitely real.<br />
<br />
He quickly rushed out of the bathroom, trying to figure out what to do next. He settled on grabbing his phone and dialing up Jannes again. He&#39;d have an answer.. he&#39;d better have an answer.</p>
