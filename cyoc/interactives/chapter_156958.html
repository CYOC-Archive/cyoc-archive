<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The city council meeting went relatively quietly as they discussed some of the standard matters of business that would be pretty typical for any city government. Nothing was too controversial and Tom figured that most people would see at fairly standard, particularly when many of the people who&#39;d come voicing concerns regarding his plan for the big reveal on the were secret didn&#39;t interrupt the proceedings. Some of that might have simply been the result of what he reported regarding things he&#39;d found out while covering some of his other assignments, though the biggest thing that he figured effected that was what the Deputy Mayor had spoke as a side update regarding this new family that had moved to Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
For Tom was well aware of where he likely stood with regard to many of Moon Lake&#39;s residents. Those that were on board with his idea might see him as a visionary or an idealist with a good argument, though because he&#39;d come from outside Moon Lake, the fact that he had a good argument was about the only thing that many of them would see as worthwhile. Largely as small towns tended to have a sense that if you came from outside the town, you didn&#39;t necessarily fit in or represent the town, and that was going to be the thing that also likely drove many that opposed the big reveal in Moon Lake. Tom wasn&#39;t a local and had only recently become a werefox to be with Alice. As such it would be assumed that he didn&#39;t know about the things that Moon Lake&#39;s weres had endured in the past before Moon Lake was established as a town and that the reveal would be little more than an outsider&#39;s daydreams and thus wouldn&#39;t be trusted.<br />
<br />
Now, technically, this new family wouldn&#39;t be fully seen as &quot;part&quot; of Moon Lake, either, but Tom also reasoned that their response being as positive as the Deputy Mayor said it was would be something that would at least chip away at the outright opposition. For the fears and worries that many weres likely had came from the result of past persecutions in which being weres was seen as sinful and threatening, and in an isolated community like Moon Lake, those fears generally stood to become something of a major feature, even as the world changed around them. That fear would also likely operate on the assumption that the best response from humanity would be that of suspicion and distrust, not acceptance, and those cases that would have that would be few and far between and would rely on Moon Lake maintaining some systems designed to retain control with new residents until they accepted that weres and potentially being one weren&#39;t that bad. Thus a report on open acceptance would actually get in the way of those fears. Tom couldn&#39;t say how much it would sway the argument, but the moment, he felt it at least calmed the people there down a bit.<br />
<br />
As the meeting ended, Tom stayed close to Alice and Lucy Stevens while many of the guests that had come in departed. Some glanced to him, and Tom did note some looks of suspicion, but for the most part that was the worst that he&#39;d gotten. He stayed quiet and waited until Harold Stevens approached them. The male wereraccoon hugged Lucy and gave her a small kiss on the cheek before looking to Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it may have been a bit out of place with regard to the scheduling, but your update would be a bit interesting,&quot; Harold stated calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again... I didn&#39;t know that this was one of your normal meetings, I&#39;d only just gotten back from my own assignment in Spokane,&quot; Tom answered weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not complaining,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;the people that you talked with were there earlier than your arrival with Alice and were asking all sorts of related questions. In this... your reveal idea is rocking the boat and they&#39;re worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t back away from it,&quot; Tom answered firmly as the four of them made their way out with Alice on Tom&#39;s arm and Lucy on Harold&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not trying to say you should,&quot; Harold commented softly as they went down the stairs toward the first floor, &quot;I&#39;ll admit that personally... I wouldn&#39;t that in favor of the idea, but neither can I deny the reasoning you gave in the debate. We&#39;ve had some close calls that all had the potential to expose weres to the world and in a negative light. Which means that many of the things we&#39;ve done in the past aren&#39;t working as well as we&#39;d prefer to think they are... and thus coming out in a way that could at least present weres in a positive light must be attempted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded at that as they began their slow walk back to the Stevens house. The night air was still cool and in a way refreshing, which was good as Tom reflected on both the reveal and what had gone on before the present meeting. The issue that weres were reaching a point where they had to come out into the open was a central part of his plan and the need for it. And given how long were society had lived in secret there would be bound to be some kind of resistance to weres coming out into the open, even if it was necessary. The cool quiet air had a bit of a calming affect as they walked along. There was a bit of calm as they retraced their steps back to the Stevens home and as it came into view, there was no crowd of people there protesting the reveal, as Alice had said happened the night before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still a bit sorry over some of the stuff that has been forced on you with this...&quot; Tom admitted to Harold as he looked forward to the man, &quot;the protest and all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing that can be done about that,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;and in the end... no one was hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am glad for that,&quot; Tom spoke...<br />
<br />
&quot;And it will probably be something that will remain something that everyone will have to cope with,&quot; Lucy spoke up, &quot;Not just normals outside accepting that weres exist and welcoming them into society but weres recognizing that the world is changing and that all those changes will have their consequences. Now... let us drop this subject for the evening as I&#39;m sure it will dominate tomorrow night, which should be the first meeting regarding planning this reveal. Best to give everyone a moment of peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Alice answered as she rested her head on Tom&#39;s shoulder, &quot;and I did get some things started with regard to dinner... there shouldn&#39;t be too much to do when we get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good, dear,&quot; Lucy looked back over her shoulder, &quot;It&#39;ll be nice to have a good dinner after a long day...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More after a long drive,&quot; Tom commented, &quot;some restaurants can be pretty good... but a home cooked meal will always have an appeal that a restaurant can&#39;t match.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded as they made their way in. At the rear of the procession, Tom let Alice go as she went forward with Lucy toward the kitchen to put the finishing touches on dinner, leaving Tom alone with Harold in the living room. Both could see relatively well in the low light, but Harold still walked over by a small table and bent over to turn a small plastic knob on the side of the lamp that was on that table. With a small click that light came on and Harold stood up and motioned to the couch that Tom stood near while moving to sit in the chair next to the table the lamp was on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what&#39;s Spokane like?&quot; Harold asked politely and keeping the subject away from the big reveal for the moment, hoping to think things comfortable. Endlessly discussing the fact that many of the potential conflicts that revealing the were secret had already begun, even if it was only debate and resistance from weres opposed tot he reveal wouldn&#39;t make things better. And to a certain extent, Harold meant what he said about Tom having a good argument earlier. There might be some resistance, and the protest frightened him a little, but he also couldn&#39;t argue that things weren&#39;t reaching a point where little to no choice remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit less rugged than it is here,&quot; Tom commented, &quot;there are some mountains that you can see to the north and east of the town... but it&#39;s not like it is here with the down built in the valley between four peaks. And the city can make for an interesting view.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold slowly nodded, making Tom blink with some surprise. The older man&#39;s face showed some interest, but it wasn&#39;t with some familiarity with the eastern Washington city. It was like Harold was wanting to learn about the city.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve never been to Spokane? For any reason?&quot; Tom asked with some wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was born in Moon Lake and grew up here,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;and we&#39;ve had our fair share of wilderness, thus there isn&#39;t the perceived need to go to parks like Yellowstone… and if we were to go to a national or state park, there are some of those that are already closer to us than any of the others in the country. And with regard to work... we&#39;re close enough to Seattle that Moon Lake&#39;s residents can drive to Seattle for work. And with Moon Lake being a college town... most weres that have grown up here tend to go to school here, with the idea that Moon Lake College would allow them to indulge in the things they enjoy as weres that other colleges wouldn&#39;t allow for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t you have some extracurricular events while in school?&quot; Tom wondered, &quot;something in sports or academics? Or even going to see historic monuments in other states that would require you to go east?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some have... though often in wanting to look for jobs that they can&#39;t get here or in Seattle,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;others have because they&#39;ve seen military service, some  of it going back as the American Revolution... or so I&#39;ve been told. But among those that have lived here and not had some other reason to go... no. Most of us have stayed here, because it&#39;s been a place that we&#39;ve felt safe. It may be something that needs to change... particularly now that technology is rapidly changing... but that&#39;s a different issue altogether.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be something to change once things go forward,&quot; Tom commented, &quot;seeing more of the country can show you things in ways that reading news papers and books doesn&#39;t show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Harold admitted slowly as a voice calling them to dinner came from the kitchen and both dutifully followed.</p>
