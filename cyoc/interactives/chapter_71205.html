<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, in that case I want to go next,&quot; Jack heard himself say.<br />
<br />
Being on stage was making him nervous enough and this strange woman with her amazing powers made him want to just get whatever was going to happen over with so he could get back to a normal life. A normal life is a rare thing in the best of times and little did he know that the rest of his life would be far from normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? And what would your wish be?,&quot; said the enchantress.<br />
<br />
Jack took a deep breath, his heart pounding. What did he want? To be a good wrestler, I guess. And to be a good wrestler you needed strength so...<br />
<br />
&quot;I want bigger muscles.&quot; he said, blushing.<br />
<br />
The Madame smiled and some of the audience chuckled. Jack was already pretty muscular for a teen, but like most boys what he had was never enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I-I want to be strong, s-strong enough to defeat any opponent on the mats,&quot; he added nervously. <br />
<br />
Madam Illusia smiled reassuringly, &quot;I can read your mind the same as your friends.&quot; She gestured to the lion cubs, who were playing together blissfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know just the thing,&quot; she said and began waving her hands.<br />
<br />
Jack was awash with a warm and unusual tingling feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
His arms, chest, shoulders and back tensed up, as if he were squeezing his muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. whoa..&quot; he moaned. <br />
<br />
His abs tensed up as well. His dark blue shirt tightened further around his upper body but loosened around his stomach as he gained a much more defined V-shape.<br />
<br />
He looked down at his swelling chest, then held his hands out in front of him as he witnessed his biceps pumping up like a tire.<br />
<br />
He felt an aching in his legs next as his quadriceps began growing. <br />
<br />
His black jeans tightened around his thickening thighs and ballooning calf muscles. His glutes began pressing against the seat. There was a groan of denim as his body changed underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, and like your friends, let's see some of your totem animal. And I do want to warn you, Jack my dear, that our totem animals aren't always what we expect. There will be much for you to learn and quickly,&quot; said Madam Illusia.<br />
<br />
Jack furrowed his brow, not knowing what that meant. His muscular growth was still happening but it was now accompanied by a feeling of warmth. It was very warm. It was like someone turned the stage lights up even brighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-- what's happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Jack slowly sank down to his knees and leaned forward so that he was on all fours.<br />
<br />
The motion caused his shirt to ride up to his nipples, showing the audience his now magnificent washboard abs.<br />
<br />
His body flushed red and he began sweating as if he had a fever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuugggh...&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
A different intensity of tingling began in the tips of his ears. His mouth felt fuzzy, like when the dentist gave him novocaine.<br />
<br />
The Madame produced a stack of index cards and cleared her throat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Jack, let me introduce you and the audience to your new body.&quot;<br />
<br />
A tingling began in his nose. Jack's heart was pounding. This was intense and very surreal.<br />
<br />
&quot;The common pig,&quot; she announced, tossing the first card off the stack. It tumbled through the air and vanished in a silent puff of smoke when it hit the stage<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooooo!,&quot; cried Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shush,&quot; said the Madame with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, NO! What did I do to deserve this?&quot; Jack cried, his pointed ears extending away from his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear, I am giving you a gift. Calm down and I will explain.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... errrrruuughh..&quot; protested Jack. He stared cross-eyed at his nose as it tilted up and shortened into his face.<br />
<br />
The Madame began reading off the card: &quot;Now, it's a common misperception that pigs are greedy. In fact, pigs tend to be quite friendly and generous with each other. They're not unlike dogs, really, except that dogs have been bred for loyalty.&quot;   She tosses that card too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeuuurrrrgh&quot; moaned Jack. His muscles were still growing. His triceps wedged his shirt sleeves to rip up to his shoulders. He arched his back as his shirt ripped right down the middle, causing only remnants to cling to his chiseled form. The collar was still attached to his thickening neck. Stephen dutifully walked over and snipped it off with a pair of scissors.<br />
<br />
Jack's reddened skin appeared to turn pink as short, soft white hairs began sprouting all over his torso.<br />
<br />
The Madame read from the next card: &quot;Another misconception about pigs is that they are fat by nature. This is untrue - they are actually quite lean, although like humans they are all too happy to eat a bad diet. This means that you will still need to watch what you eat, get plenty of exercise, etcetera to take care of your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack whimpered, followed shortly afterwards by a pop as his jeans could no longer take the stress his more muscular thighs and glutes were putting on them. His stretchy white briefs were more resilient, thankfully.<br />
<br />
Jack lifted one hand up in front of his sweaty face and watched incredulously as the skin between his index and middle finger as well as the skin between his ring and pinky fingers began swelling up the length of his digits. His thumb thickened as he held it out in front of his comically piggish face. His ears flopped down by his cheeks.<br />
<br />
He then went back to all fours and leaned forward, crying out as his shoes burst open, followed shortly afterwards by his socks tearing. His ten toes had merged into two large appendages on each foot.<br />
<br />
The Madame read from the next card. &quot;Now you'll notice that you're still sweating. Pigs don't usually do that. My gift to you will be the best of both worlds. You won't be fully a pig and you'll be thanking yourself that you're not fully human when you discover the adversity you will be up against for being different. It will make you strong enough to overcome any opponent though. In addition to your new strength.&quot;  She smirked and tossed that card with a puff.<br />
<br />
An intense itching sensation began just above Jack's ass crack and he was in no way able to bend back and scratch it. With a frustrated moan as he lifted his butt in the air, his massive muscular thighs providing him some modesty from the audience. The underwear rubbing against it brought an instant of relief followed by an intensifcation of the itch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gawd, eeeeEeeeuuuraaagh&quot; he cried in frustration. The elastic band on his underwear lifted up and a small tail poked out. Jack tensed and pushed as it continued growing out. It lazily curled up into a distinctive feature of a pig.<br />
<br />
Jack panted, sweat dripping down his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, no more, please..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but Jack, we're just getting to the best part.&quot; The Madame tapped her stack of index cards and cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would anyone want to be a pig,&quot; she read to the audience. &quot;How could this possibly be a gift?&quot;. She flicked the card away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Uuuunngh!&quot;  Jack was attempting to claw at the stage with his four large fingers. He looked straight ahead and shut his eyes from the sudden increase in intensity from the sensations assaulting him<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at his cock!&quot; shouted a hillbilly from the front row, earning a brief but nasty glare from the Madame.<br />
<br />
His penis was erect and straining against the fabric of his already stretched briefs, which were turning frayed and see-through from all the stress. <br />
<br />
There was a snap as his underwear split in the front, his member freed and continuing to change.<br />
<br />
Scotty bit his lip as he watched the spectacle, getting a bit hard himself as he imagined what it must be feeling like for his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please, I, I, I, urgh!...&quot; Jack pleaded. Two white tusks slipped their way past his lower lip. He opened his mouth and drooled a bit as his jaw pushed out slightly.<br />
<br />
He coiled back slightly, his hugely muscled and slightly furry frame quivering.<br />
<br />
The Madame grinned and read from the last card. &quot;That's because the best part of being a pig. Is that an orgasm can up to THIRTY. MINUTES!&quot;  She tossed the card while holding both arms over her head triumphantly.<br />
<br />
With a shout from Jack, his legs splayed outward, instantly tearing away the remnants of his underwear. His hips thrust forward and his now curly penis straightened to erupt with a load of cum.<br />
<br />
He continued thrusting, his eyes closed and shouting, &quot;Ahhh! Ahhh! *snort* AAAAAHHHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience broke out in applause and cheering as the huge bodybuilder pigman continued thrusting on stage, a puddle beginning to form underneath him. <br />
<br />
Stephen appeared out of the wings wheeling a bucket with a mop in it. Eric and Riley continued playing, too engrossed in their new forms to have been paying attention to their friend.<br />
<br />
The Madame turned to Scotty. &quot;Well, your friend is going to be a while.&quot;  Jack squeal-grunted on queue, unleashing another torrent of semen. The embarrassment of this happening on public taking a back seat to the mind-blowing pleasure he was experiencing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what will it be for you?&quot;</p>
