<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin felt like he was far too drunk. The party had already taken a turn for the bizarre when a couple of gay dudes in Speedos started having aggressive sex on the balcony right in front of them. They had managed to lock them out, or so Colin and the others had thought. Cam was SUPPOSED to be keeping an eye on them, but then, how did that explain how they'd managed to get back into the apartment without breaking the door?<br />
<br />
But then the situation got a whole lot worse. Most of the party members had moved to the kitchen and living area. One of the Speedo clad men bound into the room on all fours and leapt onto one of Colin's mates. Colin was so drunk that he laughed at his friend as the gay guy began to kiss him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-OUCH!&quot; his friend exclaimed. Colin figured he must have been bit or something. Alright then, he thought, better cut in now before shit got out of hand... <br />
<br />
And then...huh? His friend wrapped his hands suddenly around the Speedo man, sliding a hand into his Speedos and rubbing around his asshole with his index finger. The Speedo man moaned, and ripped his friend's shirt open and began to suck at his nipples. Colin and the others were bewildered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...hey that's Cameron!&quot; Colin slurred, recognising the muscular Speedo man as his friend. &quot;Wha-what the fuck are you doing to him?&quot; Colin couldn't figure out how Cameron had grown so muscular or what the hell was happening. The room was getting loud with shouting and swearing.<br />
<br />
But neither of the two men were listening. His friend ripped out his own belt and tossed it to the side. Muscles began to bulge out of his chest and arms. Cameron eagerly tore open his jeans now and furiously pushed his face into his friend's balls, sucking and nibbling at them whilst his friend began to pant and groan. Precum was noticably stained against the front of his friend's white briefs, and his hard on had grown huge. <br />
<br />
Colin began to back away, confusion mingled with disgust. He bumped into someone behind him and turned around in a daze, only to be met by a Speedo man sucking another friend's cock. His friend was holding his shirt up and rubbing his own nipples; his jeans were shucked around his ankles. Colin noticed one strange detail though, that his friend had a bright red Speedo on that was tucked under his balls whilst the Speedo man continued to suck him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're...they're doing something to us! They're making us turn into 'em!&quot; Colin shouted. &quot;DON'T LET THEM TOUCH YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
There were about 12 men in the room. Colin bolted as best as he could in his drunken state past Cameron and his friend (who was now also sporting a red Speedo; Colin did a double-take, having been convinced the friend was wearing white briefs only a moment earlier). Most of his friends followed quickly as possible, tripping over their own feet, furniture and the men starting to fuck each other. Colin heard a muffled yell, spotting his brother Michael stumbling right over Cameron and his other friend and landing amidst the two in a tangle of limbs. If Michael thought he'd be able to escape unscathed at this point, he was mistaken. He'd interrupted their fucking, and it looked like they were hungry for more. As Michael struggled to get up, Cameron yanked him backwards and shoved his Speedo-clad ass onto Michael's face, effectively holding him in place by sitting on him. Colin yelled at Michael to get up, but the situation was getting frantic. He turned to make his own escape, not looking back to see what was happening.<br />
<br />
Colin and the remaining guys made for the door of the apartment. The way was blocked by two Speedo men waiting, growling and stroking their hard ons. Precum was glistening on the front of their Speedos, and it was clear they were horny and ready to attack even before they lunged at Colin. <br />
<br />
Colin fell completely backwards in shock; his other mate Kyle standing right next to him had been able to maintain his balance, but this turned out to be for the worse. As Kyle was closer, the two Speedo men landed on Kyle's arms and pulled him to the floor. One of them held Kyle's arms tightly at his side, whilst the other tore open Kyle's shirt. Buttons popped off and Kyle was utterly beside himself in fright. He gasped as the Speedo man ran his fingers through his chest hair, smiling widely as he watched Kyle react with a twitch to his touch. Then, squeezing Kyle's chest hair, the Speedo man dove in and bit into the side of Kyle's neck. Colin barely looked back as he heard Kyle's gasping turn to moans of pleasure, hearing the sound of Kyle's zipper being opened behind him as he ran back into the apartment looking frantically for another way out or a place to hide. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quick!&quot; Colin yelled groggily, still feeling drunk. &quot;The bathroom has a lock on the door! We can seal ourselves in there!&quot; <br />
<br />
The Speedo men blocking the door were too busy with Kyle and each other, their eagenerness to finally being able to blow their loads of cum getting the better of them. Kyle's chest itched madly as the hair across it began to suck inward; at the same time, muscles began to push outward like crazy. An urge grabbed at Kyle; he needed to taste cum. Right now. He fought one of the Speedo men off of the other, freeing his throbbing cock from the red Speedo and began to suck his former captor off. He felt his shorts burst out suddenly from behind as his ass broke through the material. He briefly stopped to look back, seeing that the shorts had been ripped clean off his body by the burst of muscle in his legs and ass, but he was now outfitted in a red Speedo. Now he was clad just like his captors. He turned back to the cock, licking up the shaft before swallowing the whole thing. He felt the waistband of his own Speedo getting lowered from behind, and then moaned with excitement as the other Speedo man began to eat out his ass. <br />
<br />
Colin and the remaining 7 or so of the guys made it to the bathroom.</p>
