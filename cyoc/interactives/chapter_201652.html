<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derek Hallman wasn&#39;t on the team - he was a friend of a lot of the guys who were - and so as he watched what went on, it seemed to click in his mind. He knew what was happening - as slow going as it was - and it kind of amused him that it was going on. He&#39;d see what happened in the long run, but for now he was intent on enjoying the show. Derek was somewhat of a reclusive guy - a platinum blond haired rich boy who often lived by himself while his parents were out of town doing business in another state. He had muscled up his body with both artificial additives as well as natural weightlifting and some basic good genetics for it.<br />
<br />
The result was a gelled back, muscular young man with well formed features, intense aesthetics, and just enough of a roid gut to make it a little obvious to those in the know about how exactly Derek got his mass and tone developed to such a degree. &quot;Welcome, welcome to the party Matt,&quot; He said at the door as he welcomed his friend in. &quot;Josh and Eli are already in...I think they&#39;re relaxing by the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek watched the dirty blond lineman walk in with interest. He knew to a decent degree what was happening here. It seemed he was exempt purely due to not being on the team. And the way things were going…well, it might not be friendly of him to just not tell them.<br />
<br />
But fuck if it meant that he could really enjoy the end results.<br />
<br />
Josh Banyon, the fellow lineman, was lounging around outside with Eli while the party went on around them, mostly people leaping into the pool and others dancing in the house. Josh usually cut his black hair short, which made it somewhat surprising then to Matt that it was looking a good bit longer than usual. His thick, strong features also looked somewhat more angular and trended more toward pretty than handsome conventionally. And Matt <i>swore</i>, Josh had some very nice looking pecs. Though his nipples really were looking larger and more sensitive.<br />
<br />
Eli Morne the runningback was thin and good looking usually, but today Matt swore there was more to Eli&#39;s ass - the young man was making out a bit with one of the partygoers on a pool chair nearby a bit before they separated and she went to go join the dancing going on indoors. Eli&#39;s thin and handsome looks seemed if anything a bit more feminine - the goatee he usually wore was gone more or less, or just reduced to being very thin indeed, and his hips looked oddly womanly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Eli chuckled as he got up and got another drink from a cooler not far away, &quot;Are you checking out my ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; Matt said with a dumb smirk, &quot;If you didn&#39;t have a bad case of lady butt, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do <i>not!</i>&quot;,&quot; Eli jabbed back, &quot;I just have some extra cushion back there now. By the by,&quot; Eli walked over in a way that kind of confused Matt sexually, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be talking about my butt when you have these tits on your chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re my sweet, awesome pec---&quot; Matt was cut off when Eli openly groped his chest right then and there. At that point in the transformation, they were not wholly breasts yet, but they had developed sizable, sensitive nipples - and extra sensitivity in general. So when Eli touched him like that, Matt froze up, groaned, and immediately felt himself twinge with pleasure. &quot;Ahh...f-fuuuuuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Dude, that was unmistakable.&quot; Joshua chuckled, even as he pawed lightly at his own chest. Transparently enjoying the sensation of his fingers rubbing against his nipples. He then suddenly gulped, and shifted awkwardly in his seat - outside anyone&#39;s sight, Joshua&#39;s balls had slightly reduced in size. Despite the nature of such a change, it registered to Joshua as a spike of pleasure that rushed through him, head to toe indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fuckin&#39; hypocrite,&quot; Matt said as he watched Joshua settle back into it, &quot;You&#39;d like it, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would not!&quot; Joshua responded, &quot;I have way more self control than you, bro. No wonder you&#39;d just fire off if you had sex with Bree. Me? I&#39;d be the stud she needs---&quot;<br />
<br />
It seemed though that the argument was interrupted yet again by Eli this time. He visibly swayed on his feet with his drinks - it looked like, going by the sudden suppressed look on his face, a slight smile, and the quiver in his step that he had experienced something. His own chest had just started rubbing against his shirt, and the nipples began feeling tight - sensitive - and he immediately guessed he knew what Matt went through just then.<br />
<br />
Not that he felt sorry in the least for pushing Matt’s buttons like that.<br />
<br />
Matt took a seat before long to chat with them, and sighed, “You guys uhh…have you seen Bree anywhere here at the party?” He didn’t take the needling they did back and forth too personally. After all, it was what guyfriends did, right? Girls had their girlfriends - guys…guys had their guyfriends, right?<br />
<br />
“Nope,” Joshua replied, “I don’t think she got here yet. I know she’s coming to the party, and I know she’s lookin’ to get a hook up in after that crazy football win. Better hope it’s with a man like yours truly.”<br />
<br />
“You wish!” Matt leaned back and flexed a bicep, “She’ll bring me upstairs.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, what if she wants both of you guys?” Eli asked with a mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
Both Matt and Josh looked at each other briefly, as if contemplating whether they’d be willing to do something like that for the sake of sleeping with Bree. Their changing minds and bodies, still mostly in the configuration of decidedly “dudebro” jocks, were conflicted. Most of all by the implementation of the changes to their gender and their presentation.<br />
<br />
“I think I’d be willing to do a threesome with another guy,” Matt said as he took a more interested move forward, “If it meant getting to be with Bree. I mean, what does it matter? Long as it feels good for us in the moment, I figure we don’t need to talk about what we did to get there. You know?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno if I’d be willing to get naked and sexy with you, Matt!” Josh awkwardly chuckled, even though the idea was appealing to him on surprisingly many levels. He publicly denied it, but deep down, he was more than a little curious about the concept of man on man as part of sex with a woman.<br />
<br />
“And if she went for me,” Eli chuckled as he fully reclaimed his confidence in movement, “I’d go as far as she’d want me to, even if that meant I had to stick my dick in either of you two big old fucks.”<br />
<br />
“You know you just wanna fuck me!” Matt snidely responded, slapping his knee as he laughed at the idea. He and his bros were just…screwing around. Having some fun with the idea. They didn’t even know who Bree might want to go out with when she got here. Though he did admit that as much as they vocally opposed it initially, the idea was…appealing, in its own way.<br />
<br />
She’d get more of the men of the football team, and they’d get to—to explore things. That was a valid kind of thing, wasn’t it?<br />
<br />
The party meanwhile started to liven up as someone from Derek’s circle of friends ran through the crowd of excited partygoers to shout outside to the changing jocks, “Guys! Bree’s car just pulled up outfront!” Which neatly explained how the party - already raucous and thrumming - seemed to go ahead into the next gear.<br />
<br />
Matt stood up and eagerly started moving - Josh and Eli shortly behind him as they realized he was moving to greet Bree on her entrance to the party. He felt a sense of utter excitement to see her there, to really try and get this party date going. He had utter confidence she’d choose him. He was the most ripped, muscular and—and hot looking one out of all the football team.<br />
<br />
True to form for the hero of the hour, Bree arrived at the head of a storm.<br />
<br />
The partygoers mostly made way for her - either letting her by or offering the dark haired, beautiful first female quarterback some drinks or shouting their congratulations. She paused when she saw Matt, Eli and Josh. She briefly seemed to realize something as she stood there, taking in their changed appearances.<br />
<br />
She knew something was up. Something was different from the way it should be.<br />
<br />
But as she stood there, the sensation diminished for the moment. And she was left smiling and looking at the guys, “Thanks for the welcoming committee, boys. You three wanna have some fun here at the party?”<br />
<br />
All three gazed at one another briefly, and then she got three excited nods from the…mostly men. <br />
<br />
“Great,” She glanced into Matt’s eyes, and yet again the lineman found himself gulping as he imagined some of the more torrid things that might happen. “How about we all head upstairs? I think there’s a private dance room going on up there.”<br />
<br />
All three of us…? Matt looked at Eli and Joshua for a moment. None of them even said a word though, as when Bree gave them a come hither look and motioned toward the stairs heading up, none could object. Even if their feelings toward it were changing, none were sure what to do in such a situation. “We’ll uh, be right up babe.”</p>
