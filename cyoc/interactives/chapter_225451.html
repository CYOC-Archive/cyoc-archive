<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Returning Randy Whiptail back to the high school; Officer Louis Whitefur talked to the Raven furry receptionist in regards to those who chose to play hookey. Despite it being nearly the end of the school day, Officer Whitefur was still duty bound to find the students and return them to school or if required, home to parents that will want to talk to their child concerning education and responsibility. Now that he was an anthro snow leopard furry; officer Whitefur also wanted to make sure they became furries so as to not try and expose the town’s rapid transformation. Thanking her for the list and wishing Principal Whiptail luck in reconciling with his ex-wife; Louis made his way back to his patrol car.<br />
<br />
“Officer Whitefur to dispatch,” Louis speaking on his radio; “I have a request from high school administration in collecting truant students.”<br />
 “Officer Whitefur,” the sound of the police sergeant coming through the speaker. “What of the horny animal disturbance at the high school? Do you have a report?”<br />
“It’s a 10-4 over here,” Officer White fur responding; “student body and faculty all have been given our gift. Save the truant students,” Officer Whitefur responding.<br />
“How many students,” the sergeant responding.<br />
“Four missing students, per the attendance rolls,” Officer Louis answering; “it’s the usual delinquents.”<br />
<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
“Are you sure its safe Scabs?” The goth sixteen year old tossing rocks at the abandoned structure. A dirty broke down cabin in the middle of a wooden area behind the school.<br />
“If it wasn’t, they would have torn it down already.” The teen called scabs; sporting a denim jacket with the anarchy symbol and assorted other punk regalia; he pry’s open a loose board and shimmy’s his way in. “Now stop being a wuss and get in here, Pus.&quot;<br />
“Fucking hate that nick name,” the sixteen year old mutters as he follows his friend; “should have stuck with the other two. They are most likely shitfaced on weed by now.”<br />
“Boring,” Scabs retorting; “unless of course they managed to score liquor to go with the blunts.”<br />
“They why the hell are we here,” Pus trying not to trip over fallen debris; “this some sort of secret club house you trying to make? So juvenile.”<br />
<br />
Scabs ignored Pus’s last jab; the only one of the group that had a modicum of originality. However, looking at the goth sporting a purple streak in the middle of his black hair made him snigger at his questionable fashion sense. The white pancake makeup and black mascara, made the teen look like a walking mannequin. Couple with the trench coat of dubious provenance. Scabs still found the tale of it once being worn by a member of the Hitler Youth prior to end the World War 2 questionable at best. Scabs knew that coat was an Ambercrombie and Fitch original; he saw the tag one day. It led Scabs to believe that Pus was a poser; but seeing the sour boy’s closet full of black clothing befitting a funeral parlor, the punker had to at least give him credit where credit was due.<br />
<br />
‘Committed to his style,’ Scabs turning around. “Its not far,” Scabs speaking up; “I discovered this place last year and have been hanging out here since.<br />
Pus just rolled his eyes as they slowly headed down a set of stairs.<br />
“Great,” Pus groaning; “you discovered a basement, in a dilapidated cabin that could collapse on us in a moments notice.”<br />
“If it does,” Scabs chortling; “at least your get that morose end you’ve been pining for.”<br />
Pus just snorted; pausing his movement as he watched Scab pull out a key to a lock that looks new compared to everything else.<br />
<br />
“Security,” was all Scabs said as he opened the door. He steps in and flicks on a light switch. Pus was stunned that this hovel had power. He soon learned that Scabs jury-rigged an extension cord and is leeching power from the school. The small room had a well use coach, a few milk crates and a stack of pallets being used as a table. Pus just flops on the sofa while Scabs grabs a bottle hidden under some random trash.<br />
“Mescaline,” Scabs grinning; “while Lankey and Slag are trying to score beer to go with their weed, we shall truly get hammered with magic fun juice.”<br />
“Then lets set the mood,” Pus smirking as he pulls out his smart phone; “Some music to set the mood. You have any requests?”<br />
“Metal,” was all Scabs said as he took a swig from the bottle before passing it to Pus; &quot;Preferably Ghost or King Diamond.&quot;<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“Officer Whitefur,” the radio blaring in the police cruiser; “you are familiar with the delinquents so you will need to apprehend them solo. All other officers and state troopers are currently busy.”<br />
“Affirmative Sergeant,” Louis Whitefur responding; “over and out.”<br />
Turning to his computer, Louis Whitefur punches in the names of the four missing students. He had a good ideal where Adam Framble aka “Lankey” and Travis Gamble aka “Slag” are.<br />
“If they aren’t at the back of the liquor store, then they are passed out in Lankey’s Parent’s pool house,” Officer Louis musing.<br />
“As for these two,” Louis looking at the screen; the information of Henry Babbins aka “Scabs” and Rudolph Vonhess aka “Pus”, Officer Luis could only guess. “Let’s collect Lankey and Slag first,” Officer Whitefur making sure his cuffs are at the ready as well as a second pair.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
Slag and Lankey were giggling as they went to town on the bong filled with weed. Slag scoring it from a supplier he had up in Canada; he was finding it real easy to smuggle the product since it became legal up there. Having to pay a bit of a premium to get across the border was a worthwhile investment. Far cheaper than some of the more hardcore drugs that Lankey has been known to dabble in from time to time; still the two were enjoying the product with a high THC concentration.<br />
“This Canadian shit is awesome,” Slag coughing as he exhales; “Scabs and Pus are missing out.”<br />
“There loss,” Lankey struggling to stay awake; “why did they ditch again?”<br />
“Who cares,” Slag passing the bong over; “More for us.”<br />
<br />
“All too easy,” Officer Louis smirking as he observes the two high as a kite. Using his runes to make him invisible after parking the cruiser beyond the entrance to the large manse; the anthro snow leopard furry made his way to the pool house. He was watching them for the pass twenty minutes as they slowly got stoned, hoping they would offer up some information as to where Scabs and Pus are; but not getting anything.<br />
“How about a different approach,” The furry officer walking towards the two. Still invisible thanks to his runes, Louis Whitefur scratches the two with his claws. Both react thinking they got stung by a mosquito and continue to smoke it up.<br />
“Now we wait,” Louis musing as stands back and observes,<br />
<br />
Lankey and Slag continue to pass the bong back and forth for a few more times before Lankey stumbles to get up. “I need a drink,” he stammers as he makes his way to the bar. “Hope dad restocked,” Lankey slurs as he opens the mini fridge.<br />
“Beer me,” Slag shouting as he refills the bong with another ounce of weed.<br />
“On it,” Lankey responding as he shuffles the soda out of the way to get at what he hopes are suds in the back. “Score,” Lankey grinning as he pulls out a couple of bottles and hands one to slag.<br />
“Pale ale,” Slag looking at the bottle before removing the cap and taking a sip; “at least it isn’t a cerveza.”<br />
“Yeah,” Lankey beginning to feel relaxed; not knowing that the furry virus is starting to take hold; “those Mexican Beers taste like piss.”<br />
<br />
Both continue to sip in silence before Lankey gets up and sits next to Slag.<br />
“Is it just me,” Lankey looking at Slag; “or is it getting hot in here?”<br />
“I am feeling a bit warm as well,” Slag putting down the beer and removing his shirt; “did you turn the heat on?”<br />
“No,” Lankey also removing his shirt;” missing the small patch of fur sprouting from where he was scratched. Both boys now bare chested staring at each other and feeling aroused.<br />
“Dude your pitching a tent,” Slag being the first to break the awkward moment as he spots the bulge in his friend&#39;s pants.<br />
“Same with you,” Lankey breathing hard; trying to look away, he turns to his bottle of beer and takes a long sip. Looking back, Lankey can see Slag has already removed his pants and is working on his socks.<br />
“Seriously? put your pants back on,” Lankey looking stunned; unaware that he was removing his pants  as well.<br />
<br />
Soon the two boys were completely naked and then embracing each other in a mad fit of unbridled passion. Falling to the ground, both wrestled each other to establish dominance. In the end, they positioned themselves in a sixty nine position; each other staring at the others massive erection. With a heavy pause, each begin to take the others penis into their mouths and start sucking. The sensual act helping the furry virus take further hold. <br />
<br />
Officer Louis removes his invisibility spell and approaches the two boy as they are furiously sucking each other off. There moans denoting pleasure as their body begin to shift and change. Lankey growing a pelt of silvery gray fur; a small button tail forming above his ass. His hand and feet becoming paw like as black claws form at the end of each digit. His ears becoming rounded as his nose pushes and flattens; his face looking more and more Koala like. Slag’s skin was looking dry and flakey; Officer Louis soon notice that the skin was peeling off and underneath a shiny coat of copper scales appear. His face flattening and becoming snake like; Louis Whitefur notices a forked tongue flicking out of the reptilian muzzle as it tickles Lankey’s now animalistic shaft. Slags hands and feet develop sharp looking claws as his balls become internal like that of a reptile. Slag&#39;s shaft become tapered and emerging from a horizontal vent. Both shudder as they each cum in unison. Runes appearing on each other’s wrists and ankles, as they each pump cum in each other’s maws.<br />
<br />
Officer Louis Whitfur was able to tell that Lankey became an Anthro Koala Furry. But slag as he stood up looked like a bipedal anthro copperhead snake furry. Approaching the two as they slowly came to their senses; the two have a satisfied look on their faces as the furry virus finishes their transformations.<br />
“You two have been caught skipping school again,” Officer Whitefur looking stern; “so unless you want to be in detention until you graduate, you better tell me where your friends Scab and Pus are.”<br />
“It’s better if I show you,” Lankey speaking slowly; “but don’t let Scabs know I had a paw in telling you. He has no idea that I know of his little flop.”<br />
“I’m coming two,” Slag hissing thanks to his forked tongue; “lets both give Scabs and Pus this gift.”<br />
“Then afterwards,” Louis whitefur grinning through his muzzle; “the four of you can work off some of your community service by assisting the police.”<br />
“What as deputies,” Lankey feeling compelled to cradle his new furry balls; “what happened to your nuts?” Lankey looking at Slag.<br />
“I think they are internal,” Slag’s lisp disappearing as he gets use to speaking with his new forked tongue.<br />
“Explore your new bodies later,” Louis whitefur growling; “now show me where Scabs and Pus are.”</p>
