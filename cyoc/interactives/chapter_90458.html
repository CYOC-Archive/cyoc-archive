<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer recalled that she felt that her powers were similar to Clayface, or that her body was now somewhat like clay, and she really wanted to act upon that idea. Since clay is more moldable and pliable that human flesh, maybe she could get away with more realistic forms, although the ones she can produce now were also very detailed. She really wanted to try out her body as Clayface, but she also liked her body. She then realized there was a simple solution to this. Make 2 bodies! Jennifer did this once before, when she had sex with herself, and oh it was great. But Jennifer focused on her task on being a clay based body, which may bring up more possibilities to her. She focused on her whole body, and felt a fissure going through her body, from the tip of her forehead, down to her crouch, the feeling intensified until Jennifer ripped herself apart from the middle. All that took a matter of seconds, but it felt like a long time to Jennifer. When she separated, strands of flesh clung together, and she plucked them away. She then grew the other half back and she had two bodies and she can control at the same time. She then left one of her bodies at home sleeping, and took her current body out to the convenience store, shifting into clothing whilst she was walking towards the store. She went in and asked for as much brown soft clay as possible, and the guy at the register got her boxes of the soft clay that she wanted. She paid for all of it and brought it back home. She asked the cashier guy to help her move the boxes outside, and just put the there. She then thanks the guy and waited for him to walk away back into the store. Then Jennifer detached her arm, and grew another pair of arms on where her original pair used to be, then the attached her original arms on the middle of her torso. She then elongated all of her arms and split each arm into 4 tentacles, she had 16 functioning tentacles at her disposal. She then whipped all her tentacles to grab a box, and went home. She felt like a tree that had branches carrying boxes. She went to the front door, and from her torso she stretched her flesh to insert into the keyhole, and formed her key. She unlocked the door and went in the house, and closed the door, walking up towards the bathroom whilst doing so. She then opened all the packets of soft clay and dumped them into the tub, sealing the plughole whilst she was at it. She filled the tub with the soft clay, and shifted back to her naked form. Jennifer decided to choose the soft clay since she knew that soft clay was very easy to mold, and that there was more flexibility in it, which meant that her forms could move easier. Jennifer looked at the tub that was filled with clay and pondered on how she was going to do this. <br />
<br />
She knew that she could still eat, which meant that she still had a working system. &quot;I&#39;ll just replace every part of my body with this clay!&quot; Jennifer first pealed off her skin, revealing muscles and bones. She then step into the tub, and submerged her whole body in the clay. The clay shifted and replaced her skin. Then Jennifer took out her skeletal system, and the clay replaced that too. Then her digestives, blood system, lymphatic system, execration system, and finally her nervous system, all replaced by the soft clay. Finally Jennifer felt that every part of her body was replaced by the clay. She clenched her fist, and the clay responded! &quot;YES!&quot; Jennifer cried as she rose from the clay in her tub. But when Jennifer tried to rise, the clay was much more dense that her human flesh, and only a head like structure rose up, until it snapped off and fell back into the tub of clay. Jennifer concentrated and tried to get use of the clay&#39; weight and density, and tried to rise from the clay again, this time she succeeded. But when Jennifer looked at the mirror, what she saw was a clay monster. Her head and torso was basically joined together, a large lump that had holes and mouths for eyes. Jennifer tried to talk, but al that came out was a very raspy voice. Jennifer knew that getting used to this new clay body was gonna take time. Jennifer tried to move out of the tub, but her body was heavy and Jennifer simply melted her clay body down, and flowed out of the tub. The grey clay moved and it slowly slid on the sides of the tub, defying gravity, then at the edge, curving down the side of the tub and onto the floor, pooling on the center of the bathroom. Jennifer spread across the floor as she stared at the ceiling, she tried to focus and formed her body. She then felt her mass slowly shift back into a humanoid shape. She felt that that was her body and she stood up successfully. She looked at herself. She was still grey. &quot;What the hell?&quot; Jennifer ask as she tried to revert back to her original body. She then realized, this was her default body! Her body was replaced by all of the clay, and she also took out her sex organs, which meant that her whole body was composed of this clay, and she didn&#39;t have a gender, which also explains why she couldn&#39;t feel her pussy or see her breasts. She was a living lump of clay, moldable by her thoughts, and now her true form was this! Humanoid figure, no sex orientation, no hair, grey colored skin. She looked in the mirror, and saw that she didn&#39;t even have eyes, but only two holes on the upper part of her head, and a larger hole as her mouth. She tried to speak, but a raspy whisper came out. Jennifer tried to form her girl body, and she picture herself in her mind. She then felt a violent shifting of her skin, and she looked at the mirror, the clay was swirling around! Her body thinned down, two bumps appeared on her chest, hair grew from her scalp and her eyes mouth and nose and ears formed on her head. She jumped, this is working to her greatly! She then formed her skin tone, and the grey of her skin shifted into her slightly tanned skin. She looked in the mirror, and focused on more details. She formed the color of her iris, her vocal cords, the color of her hair, her nipples, her pussy. She got everything back together and she finally saw herself back in the mirror. She tried to speak and her voice came back! &quot;Now thats what I&#39;m talking about!&quot; Jennifer said as she touched her body. She touched her skin and it felt like her skin, but when she tugged at it, it didn&#39;t hurt, instead she ripped her skin off, another patch forming in its place. Jennifer knew that she had to be carful in this body, since her body was more malleable, she might need to practice more on her form. She went out of her bathroom and into her room. She looked at her original body, and herself. She called herself to wake up, and put her body into the self made wardrobes. She wanted to make more bodies out of different materials, but this had to wait. Jennifer then started practicing her new clay body. <br />
<br />
Jennifer first pulled the blinds, no one wanted to see a mud monster! She then stood at the middle of her bedroom with loads of empty space and a large mirror in front of her, and she reverted back to her genderless grey clay body. She wasn&#39;t used to this form, but she would have to if she wanted to keep this body. Jennifer then tried to form limbs on her body, and surprisingly, it didn&#39;t take her long to form another pair of arms, it felt like someone pulled on her armpits and another arms simply stretched out. Jennifer figured that her clay body should be an upgrade to her old body. Jennifer then changed her hand into a mace, and her palms ballooned out into a ball, and spikes grew all over it. She tried smashing it into a brick, and it broke in half, her hand not hurt or dented. She then tried hardening her form, and her form went from a soft clay like substance that had grooves, into a more blocky rigid form, and it withstand much more pain. She tried to break herself apart in this rigid form, and she literally cracked into dust, and she moved around in her broken clay form. She could actually scratch someone in this form, and she swirled around, and once again condensed to form her body. She reverted to her soft clay form, much more soft to touch and pliable. She melted down into a puddle of clay, and easily done that, and grew more mass, which was also easy. She reformed her body and stretched her head across the room. Instead, her body shifted her head into a blob and her &quot;head&quot; flew towards the window. She didn&#39;t loose her sight but Jennifer knew that she can be more stretchy now. Jennifer felt that her clay body wasn&#39;t much different, except for the hard clay form, which is very useful if her body was a weapon. Jennifer liked this form, but felt that her default clay body seemed somehow weak. Jennifer looked at the mirror, and bulked up. She grew more mass, and clay began pouring out from her back and stomach, covering her legs. Her torso grew, and her head joined her her shoulders, loosing her neck. Her eyes widened and her mouth did so too. She now also hit the ceiling, and she stopped. She was now a monster, which looked more towards the guy side. Jennifer didn&#39;t mind, she didn&#39;t wanted to consider her self a girl now anyways, or a boy. She can be both genders now, so forcing her to be a specific gender would hinder her mind in being a male. Jennifer looked at herself, she had a hulking body, every part of her boy was big. She forced her mind to accept that this hulking mass would be her default form if she weren&#39;t mimicking anything. She then opened the blinds and window, and she jumped out of the window. She landed on the ground with a wet sticky SPLAT as her body compressed on itself. She forced her default face, which she reminded to herself this IS her face. She leaped forwards, her clay body stretching up and landing 5 meters ahead. She thought &quot;this is much quicker&quot; as she moved. She wanted to try out her body, maybe kill someone again like this morning! She pondered over where she should be to get someone, until she decided &quot;Why not have someone go towards me?&quot; and she went towards town. <br />
<br />
She figured that although her way of moving was quick, she wanted to be quicker, and opened the manhole, melted her body down, and slid inside the sewers. She didn&#39;t have a sense of smell, so she continued moving, and moving, until she saw more lights shining down into the sides of the canal. She slid up the sides of the canal and went up into the world. Jennifer then quickly zipped across the pavement and into a dark alleyway. There she reformed her youthful body and clothes. She went out and walked along the pavement, pondering on how she should get someone to get to her. She then saw some young gangsters walking across the street, and she went back into the alley way. She grew a small eyeball on her ankle and saw the boys walking towards her. She went into the alleyway and waited for the boys, ballooning out her breasts whilst waiting. She then feigned her surprise when the boys walked up on her. &quot;Money or your life&quot; The leader said as the pushed her towards the corner. Jennifer played along and said &quot;I don&#39;t have any money!&quot; The boy then said, &quot;Well, with such a good body&quot; poking her breast, &quot;You can pay up to us with that&quot; They dragged her up a stairwell and into a room. They bolted shut the door and the leader and his gang proceeded to take off their clothing and pushed her onto a bed. Jennifer faked her resist and struggled, keeping her form together. The gang leader ripped off her &quot;clothes&quot;, leaving her with her lower layer of skin, which was her grey clay body, or maybe she might regrow her clothing again. Thankfully Jennifer quickly formed her flesh colored skin, nipples and pussy to avoid suspicion. The gang member slid his dick into Jennifer, and Jennifer made space around his cock, just enough for him to thrust in, since Jennifer basically is a lump of clay, she didn&#39;t have her sexual organs. Jennifer did however made her pussy able to suck the man&#39;s dick, so to lower his suspicion. The other gang members fondled with her tits and made her blow them at the same time. She actually didn&#39;t mind, since she knew that in the end, she was going to have the last laugh, so she went along with it, attempting to struggle, but secretly loving it. Her disguise worked until one of the members clenched her boobs too hard and he squeezed a part off. The lump of clay remained as her breasts, but Jen knew that her disguise was busted, so she quickly acted before the guys could rat her out. She quickly grew teeth around the inside of her &quot;pussy&quot; and she clamped down on the guy&#39;s cock. He definitely felt that since he screamed in pain and rolled around on the floor. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?!&quot; as they whipped out their guns and fired at her, the guys with part of her clay body threw it back at her, and she reabsorbed it. Jennifer knew that the bullets cannot kill her, and simply let the bullet fly through her into the wall. She reverted back to her hulking mass, and said with a deep man voice &quot;You messed with the wrong man!&quot; as she flooded more clay from her body, coating the walls of the room to hide evidence. She then grew spikes along her arm and whipped her arm across their faces. The guys recoiled in pain but kept firing. Jennifer absorbed the force of the incoming bullets, and let the bullets stretch her body, until she was able to ricochet the bullet back at her prey. The gang was riddled with bullets as the writhed on the floor in pain. Jennifer then divided her body into 5 lumps, and slid into each person. She went in and ripped their internal organs, the guys screaming it pain whilst so, and finally Jennifer erupted from their hearts and they fell limp. The leader regained his conscious, only to find a looming clay monster, as she said &quot;You get what you deserve!&quot; whilst growing multiple tentacles from everywhere on her body, and they punctured his body. Blood flowed out from the corpses, as Jennifer stood in the room. She experiments with her prey&#39;s corpses, and she used the lumps of clay to eat up their insides, and then they filled out the bodies. She made the bodies move, and they worked pretty well, until the skin started breaking down, and Jennifer just ate them by absorbing the skin into her clay mass as she shredded it into pieces. Jennifer then reabsorbed her clay coving the walls and with the blood into herself. She looked at the room without her clay and it was as if nothing ever happened. Jennifer melted down and slid out of the door and flew down to the bottom of the alleyway, and reformed her youthful body. She walked out of the alleyway and into the street. <br />
<br />
The street was empty and no one should see her, and she shifted back into her original form, her features twisting and contorting, disfigured and reforming her clay body that was who she truly is. She felt like a monster, which she actually is. But Jennifer wanted to lay low, and just enjoy her life. What the hell was she thinking about killing people? She must be out of her mind! Jennifer felt a twinge of guilt. She continued walking along the pavement, and reduced her size into her feminine form. She leaned against a wall, and sobbed quietly. She wanted stop this. Yet her body has so much potential. She didn&#39;t want to lose her body because of her desires. But then again, her desires can be limited to just pleasuring herself. She decided that she should use her powers just to have fun and enjoy life. She had eternity for that since she can&#39;t age, she could just reshape her body to become more young. She felt tired, and wanted to go home. But she didn&#39;t have money to ride anything. Jennifer then decided to shape shift into an animal to get home. But since there isn&#39;t anyone on the streets, she could choose any weird form she likes. She had so many forms in her head, she wanted to try them all out. She went into the alley way, and first stretched her legs into a snake tail, and even has the scaly feeling to it. Jennifer melted her clothes away and grew two more pairs of breasts, giving her six breasts in three rows of two. She even forked her tongue and grew fangs. She was a naga. She slithered out into the streets and slithered along the car roads, not worried about anyone seeing her. She slithered along the cold street roads, and was trying to think of more interesting forms. Her tail was at least 30 meters long, and she was more that 4 meters tall from the ground. She moved her tail across the ground and thought of more forms in her head. She then thought of another form and she stopped in the middle of the road. She reabsorbed her tail and her snake parts, leaving her a nude girl on the streets. Jennifer expanded her butt until it was as long as her torso and shaped like her torso. She then grew another pair of legs at the end, and grew a tail with the consistency of her hair. She grew another pussy on the other end so now she had two crouches. She then grew the same amount of breasts on her torso, but 4 pairs on her bottom torso. She ran along the road, and the crisp night air blew across her nipples and her two pussies, and she was getting hornier by the second. She then extended her nipples into tentacles, and plunged them into each of her pussies. She fucked herself whilst she ran, and her nipples turned into cocks, whilst her pussy grew their respecting parts. She blew her load whilst she was halfway to her home, and she was exhausted. It was midnight, and she had arrived into the rural areas, close to her house. She changed her form again, and reabsorbed her extra body parts, so that she was just a normal human. She then tried out a spider body form. She ballooned out her ass, and sealed the crack. She then absorbed her legs and grew four spider legs along the bulb. She then tried walking with her spider body, and it quickly scuttled forward. Jennifer like this body but felt that it was bland. She grew 3 more pairs of eyes on her head, forming 8 eyeballs. Her vision widened considerably and she scuttled along the road. Not long, she reached her home. She went to her window, still unclosed, and stretched her clay body up into her room. She reformed her default form and looked at her original body. She like her old body better. The clay body was too violent. She went into the wardrobe and controlled her original body and shut her clay body into the wardrobe. She looked at her original body. It felt normal and great. Jennifer figured she could make for bodies of different materials, but that would be left for later. She grew her snake tail again, and curled her body up and slept on her bed, pulling up her bedsheets.</p>
