<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-ho, was feeling good after his last hookup with the Ian. After getting dressed and saying goodbye Jae realized he needed to use the app again, his new life and sexual interest would be too much to manage and it was too risky to trust that Ian wanted something long lasting. So he opened up his LoveRacoon app. <br />
<br />
He immediately  was assigned to Peter. Peter was a 50-year-old man who was looking for some company. Jae-ho was intrigued. <br />
<br />
He messaged Peter, and within minutes, they were chatting away. Jae-ho liked the way Peter talked dirty to him, and he was excited to meet him. As he walked to Peter&#39;s house, he felt that strange sensation in his body again. Slowly, he felt his muscles shrink and his skin lighten. <br />
<br />
He saw his reflection a few times as he walked, he saw himself turninhg more into a twink, and maybe more European.  And he felt a strong desire for older men as his interest in nerds fell away. <br />
<br />
New memories filled Jae&#39;s mind that had never felt so free. He loved hooking up with no strings attached, and Peter was the perfect guy for that. As he arrived at Peter&#39;s house, he felt a rush of excitement. He could feel his cock hardening, and he knew he was ready for some fun. Peter greeted him at the door, and Jasha felt a shiver down his spine. Peter was even hotter than he imagined. They barely talked, and honestly Jasha was fine with that he was horny and his English wasn&#39;t so good, and didn&#39;t seem like Peter new Russian.<br />
<br />
They went straight to Peter&#39;s bedroom, and Jasha wasted no time in getting naked. He could feel Peter&#39;s eyes on him as he revealed his slender body. Peter was impressed. He took off his clothes and lay on the bed, his cock already hard. Jasha crawled over to him, and they began to touch each other. <br />
<br />
Jasha&#39;s hands wandered over Peter&#39;s body, feeling his chest and abs. He could feel his cock getting harder and harder. Peter&#39;s hands went straight for Jasha&#39;s ass, and Jasha moaned with pleasure. Peter knew exactly what he was doing. He fingured Jasha&#39;s hole, and Jasha felt a wave of pleasure wash over him. <br />
<br />
They both started stroking each other&#39;s cocks, and Jasha could feel himself getting close. He didn&#39;t want it to end too soon, so he pulled away from Peter and started to kiss his way down his body. He got on his knees and took Peter&#39;s cock in his mouth. It was big and thick, and Jasha loved the taste of it. <br />
<br />
Peter was moaning with pleasure, and Jasha could feel himself getting harder and harder. He wanted to feel Peter inside him. He lay on his back and spread his legs, inviting Peter in. Peter didn&#39;t need any more encouragement. He got on top of Jasha and pushed his cock inside him. <br />
<br />
Jasha could feel every inch of Peter inside him. It felt amazing. He wrapped his legs around Peter&#39;s waist and pulled him in deeper. They moved together, in perfect sync. Jasha could feel his orgasm building, and he knew he was close. <br />
<br />
Peter could feel Jasha getting tighter around him, and he knew he was close too. He leaned in and whispered in Jasha&#39;s ear, &quot;Cum for me, baby.&quot; That was all it took. Jasha exploded, his cum shooting all over his chest. Peter followed soon after, filling Jasha up with his hot load. <br />
<br />
They lay there, panting and sweaty, enjoying the afterglow. Jasha couldn&#39;t believe how good it felt to be with Peter. He knew it was just a hookup. It was barely a few minutes passed and hardly any words before Peter and him were clothed again and back at his front door.<br />
<br />
Jasha realized this was fun but whatever remained of Jae, Josh whoever he was before worried this would get old after awhile. Maybe I could stay like this for awhile Jasha thought, but he did see he now has 2 out of 24 arrangements and those were guaranteed hook ups.</p>
