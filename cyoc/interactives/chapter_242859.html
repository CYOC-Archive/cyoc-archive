<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Amy were cruising along in their car, driving down the freeway to reach the Inn they will be staying at.  As they were driving, Jeff was in deep thought about what he just did.  The fact that his husband side took control twice, he knew that this husband side really wants her bad.  He knew the reason was because the Chronivac aged not only their bodies, but their hormones a swell.  And giving that they are in their mid forties, it was obvious that their biological clocks were ticking like a time bomb and they needed to do it now before those clocks exploded.  He need to keep control of that animalistic nature, or face fucking his actual younger sister, now wife.<br />
<br />
So he needed to find a way in diverting to that urge and looked at the review mirror at the back seat.  That&#39;s when memories were appearing in his head.  Believe it or not, the car they were in was the same car that had owned since Jamie was a toddler. Memories flooded into Jeff&#39;s head of putting Jamie in her car seat and playing games in the car with her which he chuckled at, as well as her earlier years of listening to her problems she would sometimes have in school and now he found he was getting a little misty-eyed thinking about all of it. Amy looked over from her seat and saw him wiping away his tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong? Are you feeling alright?&quot; Amy asked putting her ring hand on her husband&#39;s muscular arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I am, it&#39;s just....I&#39;m going to miss our baby girl is all. I was just thinking of seeing her growing up in this old car of ours. Remember when we played the car color game with her?&quot; Jeff asked as Amy chuckled recalling the memory as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes. She had such a fun time with that. Oh, it does make me miss those times we had with her. Sometimes it seems like she&#39;s....you know?&quot; Amy asked looking to Jeff for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too much of a teenager?&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Amy said with a nod as she looked at their surroundings now.  &quot;Now she has a life of your own.  Top student, head cheerleader, and independent to boot.  Now all she needs is a boyfriend.  Oh, I wish that when we get back, she will have one in no time.  Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Jeffy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that and was a little concerned.  Jamie was now a teenager when she was once a middle age mother.  And if he was ramping middle age hormones, he could only imagine what it would be like for Jamie and her teenage hormones.  With a sigh, he said, &quot;I just hope that doesn&#39;t happen.  I could only imagine who the boyfriend will be?&quot;  Unfortunate for him, Jamie will have a crush, and it would be his best friend.<br />
<br />
The rest of the trip was quiet as they were reaching their destination.  They were going into a forested area as Jeff followed the map directions on his phone. Amy was incredibly amazed at the sight she saw now of the beautiful inn they were driving up to.  From the look of it, there were quite a few people there as well, but not too many.<br />
<br />
The two soon got out of the car and were next to each other as they observed the Inn, amazed at how it looks.  &quot;Oh, Jeff, it&#39;s amazing! I can&#39;t wait to get inside!&quot; Amy said excitedly. &quot;And I can&#39;t wait to get into our bedroom.&quot; Amy said as she kissed Jeff and Jeff was surprised when Amy used her tongue.  But Jeff&#39;s husband side took control once again and he kissed back and dove his tongue deeper.  Pretty soon, they were both hugging and groping each other as Jeff hand glided down her huge pear shaped ass and held it tightly.  Amy was shocked by that at first, but felt more turned on as she placed her busty and saggy chest on his man boobs.  At the same time, she secretly brought her hand down Jeff&#39;s crotched and give it a good grip, feeling it erecting at the palm of her hand.  Jeff could feel the grip and was on autopilot.  Slowly, they approached their car as Amy started to lay on the hood.  As they contiued to grope.  But as they were reaching  that distance, teenage Jeff immediately realized what was happening and got off of her, letting go of her completely.  Jeff was adjusting his clothes as Amy sat on the hood and looked to see Jeff looking a little excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;re getting in the mood, but sweetie, you have to wait until we get to the bedroom.  Besides, we have people around us. &quot;. Amy said with a seductive look.<br />
<br />
Jeff adjusted his tie and try to keep himself under control.  &quot;Sorry, sweetie.  Guess I was a little excited that we made it.  I can&#39;t wait to see what we do for this week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy chuckled and got up from the hood, with a devious thought.  &quot;Oh...  You think you are excited, you haven&#39;t even seen my swimsuit yet.&quot; Amy teased winking at Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your....swimsuit?&quot; Jeff said with a bit of a red face.<br />
<br />
&quot;But of course, in fact, it&#39;s the same swimsuit I wore when we were at the beach.  I always wear it from the time we were dating to when we had Jamie.  And despite my age, at least I still look good wearing it.&quot; she said, posing like she was wearing a swimsuit.<br />
<br />
Jeff was trying to keep their composure as he now recalled a memory of the two of them going to the beach and how gorgeous Amy looked in her swimsuit. Jeff tried to remember a time with him and Amy at their ages before he used the Chronivac, but it seemed all he could think about was their times on the beach with himself and Amy or himself, Amy, and a toddler Jamie at the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...  I will never forget how you look in that swimsuit.  Can&#39;t wait to see it again.&quot; he said as he felt the husband Jeff trying to surface.<br />
<br />
Amy chuckled and got off the car.  &quot;I&#39;ll grab our bags, honey.  You go check us in.  Can&#39;t wait to start this romatic week with my lovely and hot husband.&quot; Amy said as she walked away and let her ass shake with each step, causing Jeff to feel his heart beat loudly for his wife.  The teenage Jeff was able to hold the husband side off as Amy and her way in words and body language was not helping.  He shook his head and needed to take a breather before checking in.  Looking to the review mirror, he could see his face.  But then something strange has happened.  He could see the Jeff in the mirror say something to him.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why are you fighting back?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff saw that and rubbed his eyes to see himself in his shocked expression again.  He didn&#39;t know how that happened, but it was like the husband Jeff was telling him to accept it.  But that&#39;s not possible, is it.  Trying to forget it, he headed to the the reception of the Inn with Amy next to her with some of the luggage with Jeff helping with the rest.  This was going to be quite the week for the two.  And for Jeff, let&#39;s hope to control these urges until the week is over and the Chronivac would return them to normal.</p>
