&quot;Da-&quot; Jen started to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Times up&quot; Kyle interrupted. &quot;For you transformation you will become a copy of Juri from the TV show Yu Yu Hakusho, but with 3x bigger breasts, 3x longer tail, and the inability to wear clothes of any kind. Your breasts won't need a bra, however they will jiggle uncontrollably when you move. Next you will combine with 3 other randomized anime characters. The number of breasts you have will increase with each female character. Once a single character is<br />
complete, 3 hours will pass before the next transformation. You will revert to and remain at age 16 forever. Everyone except you, me, and because I'm merciful, your friends will think that nothing has changed. As far as they'll know you were always like that. Have fun.&quot; There was a click as Kyle hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;As if any of that will ever happen&quot; Jen said then yelled &quot;Ahhhhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

      By anonymous on 06/28/08 at 02:23:55 PM<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels like second grade all over again, major wedgie&quot; Jen said. She reached back to fix it. &quot;AHHHH! My butt crack is gone! How am I supposed to use the bathroom!?! Wait, the curse! It's real!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen fell to the floor in pain as her spine extended out of where her butt hole used to be. Then it covered itself with strong muscles and sea green scales. It was like a 10 ft long cone placed perfectly on her ass. At the tip was a small fin that looked like the tail of a tadpole. The pain subsided.<br />
<br />
When Jen stood up she said &quot;Wow! I can balance myself way better than I ever thought possible. Kyle said people I don't know personally will think I was always like this. As long as my friends understand I'll be cheerleader captain in no time. I bet I could do the same with the school's gymnastics team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHH!&quot; Jen screamed as her clothes vanished. She looked in her closet, panicking. &quot;The curse got rid of all my clothes. And because of it I can't buy new ones. I'll be naked for the rest of my life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AHH!&quot; Jen screamed again as her breasts began to grow. They  each grew to the size of a cow's udder before stopping. Her back strengthened. She took a step toward the mirror. Her breasts swayed back and forth sending waves of pleasure through her body. She fell to the floor and orgasmed. Then she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Jen woke up to the sound of someone knocking on the front door. She got up and looked out her bedroom window. It was Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, perfect&quot; Jen said. &quot;She's always been a know-it-all when it comes to Japanese anime. She can help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen ran to the bathroom grabbed 2 towels, wiped up her mess, wrapped the other towel around her waist to cover her privates, and ran downstairs ignoring her breasts. She got to the front door and talked through it. &quot;Gina?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, open up!&quot; Gina said. &quot;I heard that the guy you pantsed was talking about getting revenge before school today. Are you ok?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gina!&quot; Jen said. &quot;I'm going to open the door but you have to promise not to freak out.&quot; With that she opened the door.<br />
<br />

      By anonymous on 06/28/08 at 04:24:10 PM<br />
<br />
&quot;JEN,! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!?!&quot; Gina shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle got his revenge&quot; Jen explained. &quot;He used the town curse. But, besides being unable to wear any clothes, it isn't so bad. Well, I guess it is a bit hard to sit down. Come on in, I'll give you the details.&quot; Jen explained the conditions of the curse. &quot;And I still don't know why he didn't use the dare yet, but I need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I'll help&quot; Gina said. &quot;You want me to figure out what you are after each transformation, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, and tell me when I'm done transforming&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, why don't you sit down&quot; Gina said. &quot;You need to save your energy for the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still figuring out how to sit down&quot; Jen said. &quot;The base of my tail covers my entire butt, that makes a lot of things difficult. AHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is it happening now?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everywhere below my armpits&quot; Jen said. &quot;Except the top half of my breasts and my stomach. What's happening to me?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're skin is turning pitch black&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Jen's skin turned a very dark black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry&quot; Gina said. &quot;Just a few more parts to the transformation, hair, nails, age, and ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Jen said. &quot;AHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where now?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My head&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your ears will turn fin-like and your hair will turn green&quot; Gina explained. &quot;You'll still be able to hear, don't worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
It happened, Jen's hair grew longer and turned green. Then her ears grew longer, and thinner, becoming fins. The fins turned sea green. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nails next, right?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe&quot; Gina said. &quot;The transformations keep getting more rapid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems so&quot; Jen said. &quot;AHH! My nails!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen's nails turned sea green and grew 2 cm longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHH! I'm shrinking!&quot; Jen shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No your getting younger, and tanner&quot; Gina explained.<br />
<br />
Jen shrunk 3 inches and her skin that didn't turn black turned tan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I done with Juri yet?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep&quot; Gina said. &quot;3 hours and the next transformation will begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any ideas as to what I'll turn into?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Gina said. &quot;I don't want to make you worry, but there's 1000's of different choices. It could be a boy, or even a machine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!!!&quot; Jen exclaimed.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
&quot;I could actually become a guy or a robot!?!&quot; Jen exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, technically you'd be a hermy or a cyborg&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'S EVEN WORSE!&quot; Jen shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, I didn't say it will happen&quot; Gina said. &quot;I only said it could happen. Besides, cyborg wouldn't be so bad, it's hermy that you need to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess your right&quot; Jen said. &quot;What do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We call all of your friends&quot; Gina said. &quot;Your parents won't be back till Monday right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't matter. The curse said me, Kyle, and my friends, remember&quot; Jen said. &quot;They'll freak when they see me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that&quot; Gina said. &quot;You need more help than I can provide alone though. You could shrink down to an inch tall, or lose your legs to a tail, or worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I get it&quot; Jen said. &quot;Hey, why didn't you go to school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure&quot; Gina said. &quot;The police surrounded the school. When I got there, they told everyone to line up, go through a strip search, go home, and not come back until Wednesday. I didn't have to because my dad saw me get off the bus and gave me a ride here in his police car. I got out of there without getting a strip search.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he tell you what happened?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot;Gina said. &quot;He was kinda... off. He acted like he was possessed or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be something really bad happening there&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Gina said. &quot;We really should call your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, My Circle Text Message, it's faster&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
*2 hours 50 min into the 1st waiting period*<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, they're coming up to the door now!&quot; Gina said. &quot;Hide!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen!&quot; one of Jen's friends called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in!&quot; Jen called back.<br />
<br />
<br />
      The Next Transformation<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 06/29/08 at 02:26:42 AM<br />
<br />
&quot;Why'd Jen call us over here?&quot; one of Jen's friends asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tita, Sam, Alex, Tiffany, do you remember the Sisterly Pact we made in 6th grade?&quot; asked Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Stick together through thick &amp; thin&quot; Sam said. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, prepare for the thick&quot; Gina said. &quot;Jen, you can come out now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen crawled out from behind the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHH!&quot; everyone except Gina screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks for the screams&quot; Jen said sarcastically. &quot;Now I have a migraine. I think my new ears are more sensitive&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Jen, but... your... a-&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fish girl?&quot; Jen asked sarcastically with her eyebrows raised. &quot;I had no idea. How long do I have, Gina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...9 minutes&quot; Gina said. &quot;We should head to the indoor pool, just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK&quot; Jen said. &quot;My scales are getting dry anyways. Let's go. I'll explain on the way.&quot; Jen explained how she was cursed on the way to the pool. &quot;So once the 3 hours are up my next transformation will begin&quot; Jen finished as they entered the pool room. &quot;Gina, how much time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;6 minutes&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK I'll take a 5 minute dip&quot; Jen said. &quot;Time me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen jumped in and 5 minutes later Gina said &quot;Jen, get out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming&quot; Jen said as she got out of the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scales nice and moist?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'm ready for whatever happens to me.&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;3, 2, 1!&quot; Gina counted down.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHH!&quot; Jen screamed as she fell to the ground in pain. A pair of pure white feathered sprouted from her back. They were almost as long as Jen. &quot;Gina, want to explain the wings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Setsuna Sakurazaki, Mahou Sensei Negima&quot; Gina said. &quot;A little known show. Only aired 26 episodes. However, the manga book series has yet to be finished. My guess is that we can start the clock again. The wings are Setsuna's only feature that stands out.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      The Next Transformation, Almost There<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 06/29/08 at 04:58:46 AM<br />
<br />
3 hours passed by quickly. Gina read her manga, Jen swam and groomed her wings, Tiffany also took a dip in the pool, Alex and Sam took a dip in the hot tub, and Tita meditated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok everyone, 5 minutes&quot; Gina said. &quot;Jen, get out of the pool!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jen got out Tiffany asked &quot;Hey Jenny, have you tried flying yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm a little scared to&quot; Jen said. &quot;Breathing underwater is enough as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;3...2...1!&quot; Gina counted down.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHH!&quot; Jen screamed as she again fell to the ground in pain. She grew 2 more breasts directly below her original breasts. Then they grew to the same size as her upper breasts. Her back strengthened to support the weight, as did her wings. Her hair gained orange highlights. &quot;Gina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Breasts, orange hair, I'd have to say Orihime Inoue, Bleach&quot; Gina said. &quot;Right, that's it for now I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      The Last Waiting Period<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 06/30/08 at 12:31:52 AM<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, Setsuna is a girl, right?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah, she is&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why don't I have 6 breasts instead of 4?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had to guess, it would be that the curse can't create anything that there isn't room for.&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't make sense&quot; Jen said. &quot;Setsuna came before Orihime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I don't have a clue&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen&quot; Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Tiffany&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been thinking&quot; Tiffany said. &quot;You should try flying before you transform again. Otherwise you might become too heavy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess your right&quot; Jen said. &quot;Fine, I'll try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys!&quot; Tiffany said raising her voice so the others could hear. &quot;Jen's gonna fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try to touch the ceiling&quot; Jen said. &quot;It's only 2 stories. That's a reasonable goal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen flapped her wings as hard as she could. After a minute of effort, she touched the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did it Jen!&quot; Tiffany exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...but... I'm... ex...haus...ted.&quot; Jen said before she lost consciousness and fell like a rock. She hit the floor so hard that the ceramic tiles cracked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of the way!&quot; Tita shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can you do Tita?!&quot; Sam asked panicking<br />
<br />
&quot;I graduated from Medical College 3 years ago&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your 18!&quot; Sam exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I went to a different school&quot; Tita said. &quot;It just so happens that it was Harvard. Jen! Are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't...move...it...hurts.&quot; Jen said with difficulty.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least your alive&quot; Tita said. &quot;A fall like that would kill a normal person. Tiffany! Help me lift her. We need to carry her to that hammock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHHHH!&quot; Jen screamed in pain as Tiffany and Tita lifted her up and carried her to the hammock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lay her on her stomach&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHH!&quot; Jen screamed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carefully!&quot; Tita exclaimed.<br />
<br />
*5 minutes later*<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judging by the muscle strain in her wings I'd say she overexerted herself&quot; Tita said. &quot;Her wings are broken, her tail is broken, and her back is sprained. Let's just say, when the next transformation comes, she'll be begging us to kill her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T...ti...time?&quot; Jen asked with difficulty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen! Stop talking!&quot; Tita scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;She still has to know the time&quot; Gina said. &quot;2 hours, 50 minutes. Shouldn't you be wrapping her up right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't&quot; Tita said. &quot;I don't have the materials.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then improvise!&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I could probably make a splint for her tail and wrap up her back but, her wings will have to heal on their own&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;B...Bathroom...Garage&quot; Jen said with difficulty.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK&quot; Tita said. &quot;Gina, you and I will stay here and watch out for Jen. Everyone else search for rope or medical wrap and something short and straight. Go!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      Help Jen!<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 06/30/08 at 02:22:20 PM<br />
<br />
&quot;Tita, will Jen be ok?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anytime soon if that's what you mean&quot; Tita said. &quot;Even if the curse has healing powers, with these injuries it'll take a few days before she's able to move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about talking?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll let her talk when she calms down if she doesn't cough up any blood&quot; Tita said. &quot;What's our time limit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;2 hours, 10 minutes&quot; Gina said. &quot;OH MY GOD! I can't hear Jen's breathing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; Tita exclaimed. &quot;I'll check her pulse... It's okay. Her pulse slowed down dramatically. She finally calmed down, she's asleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should she be sleeping?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no harm in it&quot; Tita said. &quot;There's not a scratch on her head so no chance of a concussion, but that's the mystery. How did she avoid hitting her head?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can answer that if you'll let me talk&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen! Your awake!&quot; Tita exclaimed startled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have gotten the number of that bus, it hit me hard&quot; Jen joked. &quot;I regained consciousness just before I crashed. You never checked my right arm. I can't move it. If it didn't take the hit for my head, I would've cracked my head open for sure. I think my arm's broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see...&quot; Tita said. &quot;Jen, If I x-rayed this it would look like a window that tried to stop an asteroid from falling. Your arm isn't broken, it's shattered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought as much&quot; Jen said. &quot;So are you gonna wrap it up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Jen&quot; Tita said. &quot;As soon as your done transforming you're going to the emergency room!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't go there&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen's right&quot; Gina said. &quot;At this point she's more suited for a vet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, that's even worse!&quot; Jen exclaimed. &quot;I'm not going to a vet either!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Jen, Gina's right&quot; Tita said. &quot;Remember Josh, your old boyfriend? Your still friends with him, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Jen said. &quot;We broke up but remained friends when he left. He said he ended up transferring to the same school you were going... HE'S A DOCTOR NOW!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said you could talk, not yell!&quot; Tita scolded. &quot;Yes, Doctor Batin, Vet. His office is downtown. Works alone, lives alone, he's still your friend. He'll believe that the curse did this and he'll help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't you treat me?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;2 reasons&quot; Tita said. &quot;1st, I'm a people doctor. No offense, but I can only do so much for an animal. 2nd, I was fired so I no longer have the materials to treat anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why were you fired?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dating the other doctors&quot; Tita admitted blushing. &quot;The point is, Josh is more qualified to treat you than I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny! Are you home!?!&quot; someone called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God that's Josh!&quot; Tita exclaimed. &quot;Gina! Grab that tarp over there and put it over Jen. Quickly, he's coming this way. Jen, be very quiet, he can't know what's happening, not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina was able to get the tarp over Jen before Josh came into the pool room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, Tita&quot; Josh said coming into the pool room. &quot;I didn't know you were here. Have you seen Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Tita said not looking at Josh and twirling her finger in her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tita, we played poker at Harvard&quot; Josh said. &quot;I know your tell. You look away and twirl your finger in your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a tell, Tita?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Body language&quot; Tita answered. &quot;It shows your lying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!&quot; Alex said in a raised voice. &quot;I found some medical wrap and metal bars for Jen- oh Josh, what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Way to go Alex&quot; Tita said rolling her eyes. &quot;You blew our cover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Medical wrap?&quot; Josh asked with a quizzical look on his face. &quot;What happened to Jenny!?! Is she hurt!?! Tell me the truth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story short, Jen's not feeling herself today&quot; Tita said. &quot;Gina, remove the tarp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; Josh exclaimed. &quot;Is that Jenny!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's me&quot; Jen said and then explained the curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think someone needs a hug&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can't hug you, or anyone for that matter&quot; Tita said. &quot;She's severely injured. See the cracks in the floor. Jen tried to fly. When she touched the ceiling, she passed out due to exhaustion and fell like a rock. Her back is sprained, her tail and wings are broken, and her right arm is shattered. She needs a vet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't she go to the ER?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm more animal than human&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take the job, no charge&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but it'll have to wait&quot; Jen said. &quot;Gina, time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;1 hour&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
<br />
      Transformation Early?<br />
<br />

<br />
'This is strange' Jen thought. 'Why am I able move? I shouldn't be able to even lift my head. My wings feel stronger than they were before the fall.' She looked at Gina's watch. '45 minutes left. 10 pm already? Good thing everyone is asleep, for now. I'll just take a quick dip in the pool.'<br />
<br />
Jen got out of the hammock as quietly as possible and tiptoed over to the pool. She slowly got into the pool but she slipped off the ladder. 'Crap. I forgot this ladder was just waxed' she thought.<br />
<br />
Alex woke up when she heard the splash. &quot;Who got in the pool?&quot; She asked. &quot;Huh? GUYS! JEN'S GONE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone woke up when Alex yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not! I'm right here&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING!&quot; Tita yelled. &quot;YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE HAMMOCK! HOW ARE YOU EVEN ABLE TO MOVE!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit yelling, my ears are sensitive, remember&quot; Jen said. &quot;Great, now I've got a headache.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, are you feeling ok, any creaking or cracking noises when you move?&quot; Tita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine, really&quot; Jen said. &quot;Actually, I feel stronger than I was before I fell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, Josh, you're the experts here&quot; Tita said. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me take a look at her first...&quot; Josh said. &quot;No broken bones, bruises, scratches, bumps. It's like she was never hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Impossible!&quot; Tita exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, Gina?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Josh, She could be developing Namekian DNA&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Dragonball Z, right?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on Gina&quot; Jen said. &quot;What's a Namekian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Nameki-&quot; Gina began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, can I answer this one?&quot; Josh asked interrupting Gina.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can Josh&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Namekians are an aliens from the planet Namek, which of course, doesn't exist&quot; Josh said. &quot;Their DNA is similar to plants, in fact, you can see what appear to be giant plant cell mitochondria on their arms and legs. In several episodes of Dragonball Z and in one episode of the prequel series Dragonball, a Namekian got an injured arm. They ripped off the remains of it if there were any, and grew a<br />
new one. That's because as long as their brain remains intact, they can regenerate damaged or missing cells at will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well put Josh&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Gina&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we know if Jen is developing Namekian DNA?&quot; Tita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medically, we can't&quot; Josh said. &quot;But with a simple mental experiment we can. Gina, do you have a manga book on you that contains Dragonball Episode 142?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was reading it a few hours ago&quot; Gina said. &quot;Here you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, here's the page&quot; Josh said. &quot;Jenny, The Namekian language is programmed into their DNA. If you can translate these lines into English, then your developing Namekian DNA.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      The Last Transformation<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 06/30/08 at 09:50:58 PM<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see...No, I can't read it&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there's your answer&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, to prevent more injuries, I'm going to practice flying and exercise my wings&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
*43 minutes later.*<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys! I've got a problem&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Tita asked. &quot;You don't sound out of breath or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not&quot; Jen said. &quot;I seem to be accident prone today. I just forgot, Martha put a strong adhesive on this part of the ceiling that my back and wings touched to fix a leak. Apparently it didn't dry until now. I'm stuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;3...2...1!&quot; Gina counted down.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHH!&quot; Jen screamed. Her thumbs disappeared,as did her big toes. Her fingers and toes became stiff and cold. They turned yellow and were now made of metal. Her hands and feet turned blue and were also metal.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME!?!&quot; Jen asked panicking. The blue metal spread up her arms and legs to her elbows and knees. Her knee joints reversed direction making them look like some animal cyborg.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP ME!!!!!&quot; Jen screamed. Blue metal patches spread over her cheeks. Metallic blade-like whiskers grew from her metal cheeks. The blue metal spread to the rest of her face below her eyes, not touching her ear fins. Her metal jaw pushed out, turning into a metal snout. All of her teeth were yellow metal. Her eye teeth grew into cat-like fangs, longer on the top than on the bottom. Her eyelids became orange, indestructible glass covers. Her eyelashes fell off. Her pupils became slits. Her nose vanished completely.<br />
<br />
Jen found she was still able to talk properly when, once again, she screamed,&quot;HELP ME!!!!!!!!&quot; Her tongue became metal with hundreds of joints. Blue metal patches appeared on her sides. Retractable yellow blades grew out of the patches. She found she was able to spread them out until they were at a right angle to the rest of her body. She looked at them, they were sharp and glowed when extended. Throughout the whole process her muscles were getting denser and stronger, without gaining size. Blue metal covered her 4 breasts. Though the transformation was incomplete, she fell (still with a chunk of the ceiling stuck to her).<br />
<br />
This time when Jen hit, she made a small crater in the ceramic tile. A thin metal beam fell out of the ceiling and stabbed her right paw, pinning her to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch. That's gotta hurt!&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
The chunk of ceiling crumbled, leaving small pieces attached to her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she ok?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so, but she's still changing&quot; Gina said. &quot;Look!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen's lower back shifted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, she'll be on all 4's!&quot; Josh exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Blue metal spread around the base of her tail then halfway down it. Joints grew in so she could bend it no differently than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, are you ok?&quot; Tiffany asked. When she didn't responded Gina said &quot;Check her pulse!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't have one!&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;JENNY!&quot; Tiffany shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, look at her stomach&quot; Tita said. &quot;She's breathing, just unconscious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is she, Gina?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Zoid, a Blade Liger to be exact&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you just fell again&quot; Tita said. &quot;Can you move?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Not sure if I'm too heavy or too injured to move&quot; Jen said after trying to move. &quot;Get me to the water...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding, look at you, you weigh a ton!&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smooth Josh, that's exactly what you want to tell a girl&quot; Alex said.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Leave Josh alone Alex!&quot; Jen snapped. &quot;He's right, I weigh about that much now. If I ever go to school again I'll need my own big rig. Just dump some pool water on me. My scales are getting dry. Also, this adhesive comes off with chlorine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't risk it Jen&quot; Tita said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Why not Tita?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you feel anything?&quot; Tita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;...No&quot; Jen said. &quot;Even my flesh is numb. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess you never noticed the metal beam through your right paw, sparks are flying&quot;Tita said. &quot;You'll be electrocuted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen starts crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think she's in pain?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just sad&quot; Tita said. &quot;You can't blame her, just look at her. She doesn't need a doctor or a vet, she needs a mechanic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually at this point, she still only needs a vet&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about, Gina?&quot; Tita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zoids, especially Ligers, have an uncanny ability to heal a minor injury such as those dents and the hole through her paw&quot; Gina said. &quot;Besides, it looks like her metal parts took all the damage. She'll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, physically, but she's still going to die, in her mind&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that mean, Tita?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I've known Jen since preschool&quot; Tita said. &quot;Her mind's tough, but it can't take a punch like this. Look at the way she's crying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's crying her heart out&quot; Gina said. &quot;What's strange about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but now you can see through her eyelids&quot; Tita said. &quot;She's looking away from us, and not hearing anything we're saying even though were 3 feet away from her, as if she's in a trance. Didn't you notice how delayed her reactions were when we spoke to her? She's obviously deep in thought. If I know Jen as much as I think I do, she's questioning who she is as we speak.&quot; 'And she'll be gone by morning, I know it' She silently added.<br />
<br />
&quot;What'cha thinking Tita?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing... We should get some rest&quot; Tita said. &quot;It's gonna be a long day tomorrow. Martha will probably be back. Jen told me she scrubs the hot tub on Saturdays. We'll need to hide Jen. Martha's a close friend of Jen's and she'll have a heart attack if she finds out.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      On The Run<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 07/01/08 at 12:02:29 AM<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we go to bed, we need blankets, dinner, and rubber gloves&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why rubber gloves?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To get that beam out of Jen's paw without shocking ourselves&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, where are the rubber gloves?&quot; Josh asked. When she didn't answer Josh asked &quot;Jenny?&quot;. When she still didn't respond Josh started to ask Jen again but was interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave her alone&quot; Sam said. &quot;I found a pair in that closet over there.&quot; Sam went to get the gloves and handed them to Tita.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen&quot; Tita said. &quot;We're gonna get this out, it might hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tita carefully pulled the metal beam out. Jen's muscles tensed up as if she was in pain, but she didn't even blink. All the dents were already gone and the hole in her paw healed quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let's get this adhesive off of you&quot; Tita said as she poured a bucket of pool water on Jen's back. The chunk of ceiling fell off.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's better&quot; Tita said. &quot;You should start moving about now.&quot; When Jen didn't respond Tita said &quot;Or just lay there and stare at the floor. Whatever you think is best.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Late That Night*<br />
<br />
'I can't stop it' Jen thought. 'There's someone inside of me, controlling me. I have to leave, quietly.'<br />
<br />
Jen left the pool room through the back door as quietly as a 1 ton girl possibly could. She headed out toward the forest.<br />
<br />
'This feeling, I'm losing myself in it' Jen thought. 'Just keep running, don't look back.'<br />
<br />
*The Next Morning*<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys! Jenny ran away!&quot; Tita exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?!&quot; everyone exclaimed at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see her tracks leading toward the forest&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
<br />
      A Proposal? What Does Gina Know?<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 07/01/08 at 12:58:41 PM<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to get her back!&quot; Sam exclaimed. &quot;She'll never survive out there! She'll get shot! It's Open Season!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; Josh exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right, she won't survive, but not for the reason you think&quot; Gina said. &quot;She's more of a danger to herself than to anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean Gina?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zoids have animal instinct&quot; Gina said. &quot;I think Jen realized this and ran away fearing for the lives of everyone around her. If she gives in to those instincts, she'll survive out there, but we'll never see her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh starts crying silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, are you ok?&quot; Gina asked. She noticed something shining in his pocket and asked &quot;What's that in your pocket?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny's gone so it doesn't matter anymore&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ring, isn't it&quot; Gina said. &quot;You didn't come here to check on an old friend, you came here to propose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh takes the ring out of his pocket and clutches it in his fist. &quot;...I'm going after her&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody dare to try and follow me.&quot; He runs out the door, following the tracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll need our help&quot; Gina said. &quot;Jen isn't herself right now, she might attack him. If that happens, Josh will die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know all of this Gina?&quot; Tita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've all been involved in this the minute you walked through the front door yesterday, so you have a right to know, but none of you are ready to know the truth, not yet&quot; Gina said. &quot;Let's go help Jen!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      Open Season<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 07/01/08 at 03:13:24 PM<br />
<br />
'It's strange' Jen thought. 'I don't have a nose anymore, but I smell people, they're following my tracks, 2 of them. They're in possession of... gunpowder? Oh no! I forgot, It's May 1! This month is Open Season! Just perfect! Now I'm fair game! That other person in my head seems to have calmed down. Now I can formulate a plan to get back home.'<br />
<br />
&lt;Fly&gt; a voice said in Jen's head.<br />
<br />
'Who said that?' Jen thought.<br />
<br />
&lt;Fly&gt; the voice said again.<br />
<br />
'Of course!' Jen thought. 'Maybe I can fly home.'<br />
<br />
Jen flapped her wings as hard as she could. She got 10 feet off the ground and passed out. She fell again. She made a crater when she hit.<br />
<br />
'Ugh, what?' Jen thought. 'Great! I'm too heavy to fly more than 10 feet. How am I supposed to get home without getting shot? What the!?!'<br />
<br />
Jen roared like a lion from the pain of another transformation.<br />
<br />
'I'm transforming again?' Jen thought. 'But I thought the curse was over!'<br />
<br />
&lt;Adapting&gt; the voice said.<br />
<br />
'What?' Jen thought. 'Adapting? Oh, I'm adapting to my situation! Perfect! Maybe it'll help me get home!'<br />
<br />
Blue metal spread just below the base of her wings. 2 metal elbow tubes grew from them, the mouth of them were facing backward, like rocket boosters.<br />
<br />
'What are those?' Jen thought.<br />
<br />
&lt;Ion Boosters&gt; the voice said. &lt;Fly&gt;.<br />
<br />
'Ion Boosters?' Jen thought. 'Wait a second! I can use these to help me fly?'<br />
<br />
&lt;Speed&gt; the voice said. &lt;Fly&gt;.<br />
<br />
'I can increase my speed too?' Jen thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT IS THAT THANG!?!&quot; someone shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's a monster&quot; someone else said. &quot;What are you waiting for, shoot it!&quot;<br />
<br />
'Oh no! I've been spotted!' Jen thought. She got up out of the crater, fired the Ion Boosters and ran away.<br />
<br />
One of the hunters got out a cell phone and dialed a number. &quot;Yo Billy you huntin?&quot; he asked. &quot;Cause there's some freakish animal in these here parts. No, really. We seen it! It was covered in blue metal armor with rocket boosters, wings, and a fish tail. No! I'm not crazy! We really seen it! The sumbitches at city hall oughtta know 'bout this! Look out for it, it's fast! Later Billy!&quot; He hung up his cell phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That thang isn't too fast for old One-shot Billy though&quot; the other guy said. &quot;He'll get that thang.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
      Strange Reunion<br />
<br />
<br />
      By anonymous on 07/01/08 at 05:05:12 PM<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, where is she?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be patient, Blade Ligers are extremely agile and cunning&quot; Gina said. &quot;If she gives in to her instincts, or learns to control them, tracking her down would be almost impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you tell us that, Gina?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's too heavy to fly&quot; Gina said. &quot;Eventually she'll get tired and stop to rest. Then we grab her and take her home, if we find her in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How're we supposed to move her?&quot; Tita asked. &quot;She weighs a ton!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I brought this chain for a reason&quot; Gina said. &quot;We hog tie her and talk her into going home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we can't get through to her?&quot; Tiffany asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's where Josh comes in&quot; Gina said. &quot;If he proposes, she should regain complete control over her instincts and come back with us. That'll be a last resort though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that a last resort?&quot; Tita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tita, you're a girl too&quot; Gina said. &quot;You should know the answer to that. A proposal is supposed to be romantic. This situation is not romantic in the least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wrong&quot; Tita said. &quot;I say it was extremely romantic for Josh to run off the way he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess so&quot; Gina conceded. &quot;That's Josh up ahead. Hey, Josh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you guys not to follow me!&quot; Josh fumed<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! We have a plan&quot; Gina said and explained the plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;That should work, Jenny's coming home&quot; Josh said. &quot;Hey! Someone's up ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You people should leave!&quot; one of the two hunters said. &quot;There's a monster up ahead. I almost shot it but it used rockets to run away! What the? Gina? What in Sam Hill are you doin' here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vic? Bob? I haven't seen you guys since training&quot; Gina said. &quot;Well, no time for small talk. That 'monster' is the rich friend I once told you about. Code 12.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!?! CURSEMASTER STRIKES AGAIN!?!&quot; Bob exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I'd say he's outdone himself this time&quot; Gina said. &quot;The good news, we finally tracked him down. Kyle Perkins, Sector 908.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What are these civilians doing here!?!&quot; Vic asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok&quot; Gina said. &quot;They're E22's.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you 3 talking about!?!&quot; Alex asked raising her voice. &quot;Civilians? Are you in the military Gina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't tell them yet?&quot; Vic asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not ready&quot; Gina said. &quot;Come on, I need backup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What were the curses terms?&quot; Bob asked. After Gina explained the curse he said &quot;You know more about him than I do. Why didn't he use the dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mental torture&quot; Gina said. &quot;Also to steal the power back after a few days. We should go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Vic agreed.<br />
<br />
<br />
      Another On of Kyle's Victims<br />
<br />
<br />
      By loony28 on 07/02/08 at 08:57:48 AM<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on Gina&quot; Tita said. &quot;What is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not ready to know&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The girl I love is out there somewhere and it's open season&quot; Josh said. &quot;I think we have a right to know what's going on here. What training did you do? And what is an E22?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An E22 is someone that the curse affects indirectly as part of the curse&quot; Vic said. &quot;Like friends knowing about the changes or someone else changing when the transformed individual comes in contact with another person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there Vic&quot; Gina said. &quot;They're not ready yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, we need to know what's going on here&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
Before Gina could say anything else there was a 'bamfff' sound and some blue smoke. Out of this blue smoke emerged a girl. This girl was strange though. Her skin was blue. She had a tail that looked like a typical devil tail except that it was also blue. On her back were a pair of white wings. Her irises were yellow. She had flaming red hair down to just above the point where her wings attached to her back. She was also completely naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here Rachael?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was looking for Bob&quot; Rachael said. &quot;I heard that you almost shot a monster. At least that's what Billy said. I figured that it was one of the Curse Master's victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she is&quot; Gina said. &quot;He got Jen. At least we know who he is now. Kyle Perkins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must have been in retaliation for the pantsing last week&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will someone tell us what's going on here!&quot; Tiff screamed. &quot;Who are you people? Are you in the military?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine I'll tell you&quot; Gina said. &quot;First though I need your word that what I'm about to reveal to you goes no farther than right here. It's a matter of security.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't tell a soul&quot; Tiff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither&quot; Tita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have my word&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Likewise for me&quot; Alex said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Jen?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can tell Jen since she's the one that's been transformed&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then&quot; Josh said. &quot;You have my word also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then&quot; Gina said. &quot;You need a little background to understand. No one knows exactly how or when the curse started. What we do know is that one hundred years ago a group of people decided to band together to protect innocent people from being hurt by those that were transformed or dared. Sometimes that involved killing them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Jen will be killed!&quot; Josh shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the last resort we employ now&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway&quot; Gina said. &quot;Since then there has been a group to handle the effects of the curse. A few years ago a guy gained the curse's power. We don't know why but the first person he asked the question to didn't answer within a minute and the guy never gave them the dare. It seems that there's a loophole in the curse. If someone gets both and the one who wields the power doesn't give them both within<br />
a few days, then that person retains the power. After a few transformations we had reason to believe that it was the same guy and started calling him the Curse Master. He seemed to choose his victims carefully, only asking those that wouldn't answer within a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're part of this group&quot; Tita said. &quot;How did you become part of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Curse Master had gotten me after training&quot; Gina said. &quot;I was a thirty-four year old guy before last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can that be?&quot; Alex asked. &quot;What about our Sisterly Pact?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The terms of the curse didn't include anyone else remembering me the way I was&quot; Gina said. &quot;I had already gone through the training so the curse left that part of my life somewhat intact. As for our Sisterly Pact, Jen was the one that had suggested it. The curse just added me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's Rachael's story?&quot; Tita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as you might have guessed the Curse Master got me too&quot; Rachael said. &quot;I was a thirty-four year old guy before. The terms of my transformation was that I'd become a female comic book character and then I would gain the powers and abilities of three other comic book characters. I would also remain completely naked and no one would remember who I was originally. Also I'm forever sixteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't seen you around school though&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you have&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I would have noticed a naked blue girl around school&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you show them Ray&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
Ray nodded her head and then she began to change. Her skin became a more Caucasian color. Her wings and tail shrank into her body. Her irises became green. Clothes appeared on her. The whole transformation last less then a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Sam said. &quot;Is that really you Ray?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; Ray answered. &quot;Sorry to deceive you for as long as I did. Gina and I have been looking for the Curse Master since we figured he might be in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you have clothes on?&quot; Tita asked. &quot;I thought the terms of your curse included you being completely naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm still naked&quot; Ray said. &quot;The clothes that you see is really<br />
my skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The female comic book character must have been Mystique&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Ray said. &quot;Now can you guess what the other three are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well with the tail and your entrance I'd say Nightcrawler is one&quot; Josh said. &quot;The wings would be Angel I believe. I can't figure out the last one though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're right on those two&quot; Ray said. &quot;For the third one I'll show you.&quot; She held up her hand and suddenly three blades came out from between her knuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, you have Wolverine too&quot; Josh said. &quot;Does that mean you have his mutant healing factor and adamantium skeleton?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep&quot; Ray said. &quot;I'm virtually indestructible. It has saved me on more than one occasion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm a little confused&quot; Josh said. &quot;Wolverine's claws come out of the top of his wrists. They don't come out from between his knuckles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They do in the movie version of X-Men&quot; Ray said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, Jen is still out there&quot; Tiff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiff's right&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is Jen now?&quot; Ray asked changing back to her blue skinned form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she's part Juri, part Setsuna Sakurazaki, part Orihime Inoue, and part Blade Liger&quot; Gina said. She said the last part with her head down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Ray groaned. &quot;That means we can't use the tranqs safely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't told them?&quot; Ray asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I should&quot; Gina said. &quot;There's a chance that we may not be able to save Jen. Zoids are intelligent machines but they need a human pilot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Zoids are battle machines&quot; Gina said. &quot;If they didn't have a human pilot they may go on a rampage after a battle. Right now Jen has probably developed a dual personality. One is the Jen that we know and the other is the Blade Liger. If we use tranqs that could put Jen and the organic parts to sleep but the Blade Liger would still be functioning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it would be functioning without a pilot&quot; Ray said. &quot;In that case the Blade Liger would likely attack and kill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to warn Billy&quot; Bob said. He pulled out his cell phone and said &quot;Billy, that monster is one of the Curse Master's victims. Also part of it is a Blade Liger. Do not try to shoot it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do?&quot; Vic asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that we can get her back&quot; Gina said. &quot;If we can find her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we need to get going&quot; Ray said. &quot;These woods are too thick to see through from above so I'm stuck on the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have Wolverine's heightened senses Ray?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why yes I do&quot; Ray answered. &quot;I should be able to track Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's go&quot; Gina said.</p>
