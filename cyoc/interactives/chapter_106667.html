<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay. We&#39;re in luck,&quot; Henry (Huck) Jenkins, Junior said to his father. &quot;It looks like whoever originally built this house planned for the possibility of the space over the garage someday being used as a residence. Everything looks up to code, just unfinished.&quot;<br />
&quot;So does that mean we&#39;ll have an easy time of it?&quot; asked Henry Senior.<br />
&quot;Only structurally. Despite the fact there&#39;s no true ceiling, let alone insulation over us,&quot; said Huck, staring up at exposed roof rafters. &quot;Depending upon what Harry and Jenny decide on a floor plan will determine where the walls go, but that should be easy. Plumbing and electrical will still be their usual headaches, since other than a couple of bare bulbs overhead and the occasional stray outlet, there&#39;s nothing up here yet. It remains to be seen if I can squeeze a full size tub into wherever the bathroom goes; but we can make sure they have a toilet, basin, and shower at least, as well as a sink in whatever becomes the kitchen. However, all the appliances will have to be electrical, since there&#39;s no natural gas line in the area and a propane tank wouldn&#39;t be practical since you&#39;d need too long of a supply line from the ground to up here. When the time comes, would you like a separate electrical meter for this place, or are you going to just split the electric bill every month with Harry and Jenny?&quot;<br />
&quot;Which do you think is better?&quot; asked his father in return.<br />
&quot;Even if you keep all the utilities in your name and split amicably with Harry, I&#39;d get a separate meter. That way, if this place ever gets rented out to others, you&#39;re all set up and will just have to alter the payment arrangements with the electric company, but I&#39;ll make sure the garage itself stays on the existing meter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; agreed his father.<br />
&quot;Plus, you and mom will have to share the laundry room in the garage with them, but I can rig a dirty clothes chute for their stuff. That&#39;s another arrangement you can change too if this apartment ever takes on other tenants, but even without the laundry issue, we&#39;ll have to get the house a better water heater than what you already have,&quot; said Huck.<br />
&quot;All of this is beginning to look more expensive than I first thought,&quot; admitted his father, while sitting down on a couple of old boxes.<br />
&quot;Maybe, but you&#39;ll only be looking at materials. We can work out the expenses over time. Besides, a lot of this stuff I can get at strictly cost. Time and labor is on me. My crew has banked some serious overtime credits over the last few years. Since everyone just collects their full 40 most weeks and leaves any overtime hours as an unpaid credit*, that money&#39;s been sitting in the bank collecting interest until they actually need it during either the slow times or family emergencies. Then again, there&#39;s one laborer who&#39;ll be working for free, provided I can enjoy some of mom&#39;s home cooking every once in a while.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think something can be worked out,&quot; said his father with a smile.<br />
<br />
Then Henry Senior decided to change the subject. &quot;I saw the way you were looking at Miss Tachibana.&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Mrs.</i> Tachibana,&quot; his son politely corrected him.<br />
&quot;You still haven&#39;t found anybody...&quot;<br />
&quot;Not since Jill decided being engaged to a carpenter with his own construction company wasn&#39;t prestigious enough for her,&quot; said Huck, sadly.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s plenty of fish in the sea,&quot; said his father, trying to cheer him up.<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I certainly haven&#39;t found the right one yet,&quot; replied Huck. Sure, he had more than his share of &quot;fun&quot; at pack meetings, but sex in general just didn&#39;t beat that wonderful feeling from being in a relationship with someone special, like he observed between his younger brother and Jenny.<br />
&quot;Just give it time son. Things will work out when they&#39;re supposed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry Jenkins, Junior bit his lip and stayed silent. He was in his early 30s now. Harry just barely 20. Both, even if they weren&#39;t weres, still had long lives ahead of them.<br />
But their parents were normal human beings near 70 who preferred to live their lives as is and never wanted a fursona of their own. <i>How much longer do they have?</i> he couldn&#39;t help asking himself. Huck took the plunge after the family moved to Moon Lake to comply with the town&#39;s Mandatory Were Law**. Harry became a werefox to be with the one he loved when Jenny was intentionally changed by the rogue were-vixen Yvette Smith in hopes of creating a distraction and avoiding capture by authorities.<br />
Yet, while he respected his parents&#39; wishes then, now...<br />
<br />
&quot;Son? Didn&#39;t you hear the question?&quot; asked his father.<br />
&quot;No. Sorry. Lost in thought. What was it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I asked what about the architect and building permits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. I&#39;ve got enough graph paper with me to start some preliminary sketches,&quot; replied Huck, holding up the clipboard he got out of his truck, along with the 100 foot tape measure, before they entered the garage. &quot;I&#39;ll use the company&#39;s staff architect, since he only works for us when he&#39;s not teaching architecture at the college, and once we&#39;re ready to submit formal plans, permits will take about a week before we can start actual construction. Although since there&#39;s only the interior staircase within the garage right now, we&#39;ll have to establish an exterior staircase too. In front of the garage would be the best for that, since putting it on the other side of the house opposite the roof extension that connects the garage with the house would have it too close to the neighbor&#39;s property line.&quot;<br />
&quot;But we get along fine with the Jones,&quot; pointed out his father.<br />
&quot;And if they ever decide to sell their place?&quot; asked Huck in return.<br />
&quot;I see your point.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry dad. It may take longer than we first thought, but Harry and Jenny will have a cozy little love den to call their own by the first of the year,&quot; promised Huck.<br />

The employees were paid their overtime hours whenever needed at the full rate they earned them at, but the company kept the bank interest earned on the unpaid salaries during that time.<br />
