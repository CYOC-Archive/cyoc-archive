<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She hit call and put the phone to her ear. She still hadn&#39;t sat up. I pushed slightly on her shoulder, and her face slightly fell, but she sat up.<br />
<br />
The phone rang for a moment, and then I heard someone pick up. &quot;Hey, Kathy!&quot; said a quiet, tinny, masculine voice. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm,&quot; she looked at me with wide eyes. &quot;I umm, mom and dad --&quot;<br />
<br />
He cut her off. &quot;I was starting to wonder if something was up. What do you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CanIcomelivewithyou?&quot; she blurted.<br />
<br />
I smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, that bad? Yes, absolutely. Do you need help getting your stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and looked around. I&#39;d originally been downtown to meet up with a friend, but she had shown me up. It wasn&#39;t like her, so I figured she must be sick. My car was parked along the side of the road a couple blocks further from downtown.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? Your parents won&#39;t be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy bit her lip. &quot;Umm. I&#39;d like help, actually. Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. It will be okay, Kathy. I&#39;ll come over to your house later today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, I&#39;m actually not home,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need a ride?&quot;<br />
<br />
I stood up and pulled out my phone. 3:27 pm, a timer that was almost up, and hundreds of messages from Instagram. I rolled my eyes. I&#39;d posted a kissy face a few hours ago - I loved some of the attention, but I couldn&#39;t seem to get it into my head how over the top the responses always got. I put my phone in my purse without checking any of the messages. <br />
<br />
&quot;Umm,&quot; Kathy was saying, looking at me. She tilted her head at me slightly. &quot;A ride sounds good. Unless, um, Chloe wants to?&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought for a moment. &quot;No, I think I need to get home. It was nice meeting you, though!&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at me sadly and continued her conversation.<br />
<br />
Just then, I had an idea. I glanced around for something to test it with. I looked back into the bushes and trees behind the bench.<br />
<br />
[I wish my name was written on the tree I&#39;m looking at with gold letters,] I thought. And just like that, it was. I cracked a wide smile and thought a moment longer. I considered what could go wrong and added a few words.<br />
<br />
[I wish that neither Kathy nor anyone who observes it will think the next 20 minutes of things Kathy and I do are out of the ordinary for people to do in public, and I wish that Kathy will not feel rejected or invaded by me, only happy for passing love from a stranger,] I was really on a roll, [And I wish that when I kiss Kathy it will be as intense as if her lips were made of clit.]<br />
<br />
I finished my wishing and came back from staring into space. Kathy had hung up and was staring at her phone in her hands. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m so needy right now, I&#39;m not normally like this,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
I took her hand and pulled her into standing. &quot;It&#39;s ok. I can tell you have a crush on me. I don&#39;t return it, but you deserve to have good in life.&quot; and I pulled her into a deep kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
She gasped, opening her lips and practically shoving them into mine, her whole body twitching slightly. I smiled internally and pulled her body tight, holding her thin, wiry form close. She kissed me viciously, both of us trading tongues and dancing around each other&#39;s as she moved her lips over mine, repeatedly, both of her hands on my face.<br />
<br />
[I wish my lips were as sensitive as hers,] I thought in passing. And then they were! I gasped between kisses and sped up, my whole body feeling intense with a focal point around my lips as they overwhelmed me with the sensation of her lips&#39; loving motion over mine. I put a hand on her clothed ass, which wasn&#39;t as large as I&#39;d like, but I kept myself from changing it.<br />
<br />
As I did, she sped up again, moving a hand to one of my boobs, which she practically tore out of my top. I had my boob hanging out downtown and nobody was going to care. I grabbed the back of her head by the hair and pulled her still, moving my lips over hers slowly as I felt a rush of euphoria pass from my lips and down my body, my shape singing itself to me in a wave of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Neither of us were done. I was really properly horny now, my desires reshaping themselves like they always did when I was really going. She moved her hands to my ass and pulled it wide through my underwear and skirt.<br />
<br />
[Underwear. I wish I wasn&#39;t wearing underwear.] And I wasn&#39;t. [oh geez. I also wish both of our bodies were totally clean.] And the sweat and grime of a day disappeared from my ass as well. <br />
<br />
I stuck my hand down the front of her jeans, wrapping it around and grabbing her inside with my fingers. She moaned into my mouth and reached under my skirt, doing the same to me. I went still in overwhelm as she wiggled her fingers around inside me, gasping faster and faster as waves of euphoria passed through my body from my hips and my face.<br />
<br />
I realized my other hand was still on her ass. [I wish her ass was just a little more full and shapely,] and it was. I grabbed it in delight as I came, muscles all over my body twitching. She joined me, both of us kissing and tickling each other&#39;s insides and holding each other&#39;s asses.<br />
<br />
We were standing on the street, gasping, as we came down. I took my hands away from her hips and pulled her back into a soft, continuing to kiss her softly, all my neck and face muscles slightly twitching as my sensitive lips kept me in a continuous low-key orgasm.<br />
<br />
She pulled away and put her head on my left shoulder, sighing happy. I put my right hand up and rubbed her back softly. She sighed again, and I hummed a happy tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was.&quot; I agreed. &quot;I wish you the best of luck in your move and I wish you&#39;ll always remember this not as an experience to compare to, but as a wonderful thing in your memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hugged me tighter, then pulled away and looked me in the eyes. &quot;Thank you for coming over to talk to me. This is -- unexpected, but this is so much better than I thought today was going to be.&quot; She kissed me on the lips again, and both of us crumpled slightly at the knees with the intense simulation.<br />
<br />
We held each other for a few minutes longer before her phone buzzed. &quot;Alright, he&#39;s here. Bye!&quot; She blew me a kiss as she walked away.<br />
<br />
I giggled, slightly love-crazed, and waved excitedly. &quot;Bye, Kathy!&quot;<br />
<br />
I walked over to the bench and sat down. It felt strange and sexualizing, but I liked having my ass touching the wood of the bench. I pulled out my phone and checked it again. New messages from Dan! I opened them.<br />
<br />
Daniela, 3:46 pm<br />
Sorry to miss you, I got home really late last night. Can you come over? Christoph is missing</p>
