<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Is this him?&quot; the sketching officer asked Big T as he finished describing the man that had hired the gang to try and kill someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's him,&quot; Big T answered with a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Beauregard!&quot; I growled, recognizing the image immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he ever tell you who he wanted dead?&quot; Officer Barnes asked, &quot;any name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never said any name,&quot; Big T answered, &quot;But he wanted both your partner and the other tiger here dead. Talked a lot about you perverting &quot;God's&quot; or &quot;nature's&quot; law or something like that. It was someone's law.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a low growl, which actually startled the sketching officer and Big T.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't mind that,&quot; Officer Barnes tried to calm them,&quot;The guy has been leading his own little anti-animal person hate group for a while now. Officer Wayne and his wife have been the chief targets of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we don't act like a mundane animal and do what he says,&quot; I growled, &quot;stupid jerk that he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll try to get a deal arranged that will allow you and your compatriots to get a lighter sentence for cooperating,&quot; Officer Barnes told Big T, &quot;considering that you three killed four people, wounded two more, and conspired to kill two more, you may still be looking at a pretty hefty sentence... probably from going across state lines after the first part of the crime, but we might be able to urge the lawyers to get the the point of conspiracy watered down because you didn't consider committing any of the crimes until Beauregard committed the crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of us?&quot; Big T spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;The three of you are small potatoes in comparison to Beauregard,&quot; I told him, &quot;Very small potatoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So it was Beauregard that hired them,&quot; Officer Howard sighed as Officer Barnes and I relayed the information that Big T had given us.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what the sketch would indicate,&quot; I grumbled looking down at the sketch put right on his desk, &quot;that looks identical to him. Dirty...&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest was an indiscernible growl because I didn't want to really swear on the issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe he would have done something like this,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;he will lose EVERYTHING if convicted, and can be looking at life in prison. And especially immediately after R.A.M.'s little stunt with the Smiths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The attack in Peoria occurred while the trial was still ongoing,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;if he did truly organize this, it was likely because he though he could get away with it. His bid to get rid of George in the counter suit in the trial would have worked and he wouldn't be under some suspicion because of Judge Pax removing him with the threat of bribery charges. The attack in Peoria was likely intended to be outright terrorism. Leona and her parole/probation officer would be dead, and all of her serum would be contaminated...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Insuring that no new animal people could possibly be created,&quot; I commented, &quot;though also insuring that no cure can be developed with Leona dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With the amount of hate that man has been putting out, I doubt he cares about a cure,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;If all went to plan, with Officer Wayne in jail and Molly Wayne likely killed by the gang eventually, there would be no animal people in Columbia Falls and he would complete a localized genocide, which the Feds wouldn't even consider calling genocide because the numbers killed would only be two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;I... I can't believe all this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither can I,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;but the man seems to have no bounds to his hatred, and seems to think that because he has the most money in the area, he can get away with anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This should be enough to bring him in,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be enough to search his property for anything incriminating,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;he can easily deny that that is him on the sketch, but merely a man who looks like him. We may have motive in his fairly obvious hatred, but that won't be enough with only a sketch that looks like him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get us a search warrant for all of his property, and I'm sure we'll find something to justify his arrest,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two might want to hang around for awhile,&quot; Officer Howard spoke, &quot;Since Regus didn't rush to take this case, the DA can prosecute in the case against Beauregard, but he's still dealing with the can of worms Beauregard opened up on him, and it is looking increasingly likely that he's looking at being removed from office already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can wait,&quot; I told him, &quot;speaking honestly, there is nothing I would love more then to take Beauregard down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just maintain your cool, Wayne,&quot; Officer Howard warned, &quot;the man may have caused us a ton of trouble since you and Molly moved out here, but he's still powerful. You betray your personal feelings, and we will end up a ton more trouble then he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; I promised.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It took until after lunch for the open ended search warrant arrived at the station. It allowed us to search all of Beauregard's property and books. Any payments he made could be checked and anything that could be considered criminal would be enough to arrest him. As Officer Barnes and I drove out toward his ranch, I knew that we likely wouldn't find anything that directly linked Beauregard to the gang. Gangs could process credit cards, Beauregard likely paid them in cash, if he'd paid them yet at all, and I had doubts he had anything lying around that said &quot;I hired criminals to try and kill a local police officer&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... here we go,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke as we drove past the main gate to Beauregard's ranch and came right up to driveway and front yard of his home.<br />
<br />
Beauregard was not in the area but Nessie and Frank Rhoer were. Both of them came nervously from the field they were stacking hay bales in. Both of them looked on nervously as Officer Barnes let me out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you officers?&quot; Frank Rhoer said nervously as we approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a warrant to search the property and residence,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;where is Pierre Beauregard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he's in one of the barns right now,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;but I'm afraid now is not a good time, if you came back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The law does not care about your convenience,&quot; I growled, &quot;he hired the gang that attacked Peoria, Illinois and then had them try to kill myself and Molly. We will be searching NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank gave a slight gasp, though Nessie made no reaction that was visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, officers,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then began to walk toward the nearby barn. Officer Barnes and I followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nessie, you can return to stacking the bales,&quot; Frank Rhoer said calmly.<br />
<br />
Nessie moved off while Frank Rhoer lead us into the barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is Molly?&quot; he asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; I said icily.<br />
<br />
We continued through the barn, that the moment had several cattle in pens in the barn. Beauregard was looking into them from a raised platform along the edge of the pens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, these two officers have business with you,&quot; Frank Rhoer announced.<br />
<br />
Beauregard slowly turned and gave me a very icy glare when he saw that I and Officer Barnes were the investigating officers. After a moment, he managed to regain his composure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officers, what can I do for you?&quot; Beauregard asked.<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes pulled the warrant from his shirt pocket, &quot;we have a warrant to search your residence and property. That is your copy of the warrant for your records...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a separate copy of the same warrant,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Beauregard said slowly and put on a fake smile, &quot;and what did I do that warrants this investigation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Testimony that you hired the gang that committed the attack in Peoria,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;and you will comply with the warrant to allow us access to all facilities that we require.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My doors are unlocked,&quot; Beauregard answered, &quot;go on ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then turned and walked away from him and moved toward the house. Beauregard did not follow us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think he'll run?&quot; Officer Barnes wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I answered, &quot;I think we'll be luck if we find anything. If we find something, then I'll worry about catching him.&quot;<br />
<br />
We made our way to the house and found the door was indeed open. We easily went in and began to go through the house. We started with Beauregard's office which was likely where we would find anything that would be incriminating.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll check his desk, see if he has any receipts,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke, &quot;you go through the bookshelf.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a single high shelf containing a series of books. Most of them were adventure westerns or biographies of Reagan, or books that buy their titles supported Right-wing politics. The last was a spiral notebooks next to an iron bookend. Pulling it off the shelf, I read the title, written in black Sharpie ink: &quot;R.A.M. Manual, Goals, and Mission&quot;.<br />
<br />
I pulled the &quot;manual&quot; of its shelf. And I began looking through it. The first page read: &quot;God created the Earth in seven, twenty four hour, days and made it so that all animals were subservient to man. Now, thanks to some Furry fanatics, someone has attempted to pervert the world's natural order. Making animals equal with men. This is an utter perversion, for they will destroy us all in their mindless search for blood. They have already threatened to eat all of my cattle, and brothers, they will carry out that threat because that is what mindless animals do. Our only solution is to remove that which threatens us and our ranches. We must do anything and everything possible to kill Molly Rhoer.&quot;<br />
<br />
It then continued to list members and donations made for activities. It then carried in to a long hand written plan. The plan read: &quot;The city of Columbia Falls has rejected God's law of Nature that humans outrank animals and refuse to arrest Molly and George Wayne for being animals. And to make it worse, the Liberals in Congress have declared them protected under the Civil Rights Act. We must make them appear criminal and make it impossible for the Furry freak to make more Animal people. PHASE ONE is to set up a supposed &quot;attack&quot; that we can frame George Wayne for. PHASE TWO is to hire someone willing to make great sacrifices for humanity's cause and kill Leona Washburn and destroy her lab utterly. PHASE THREE is to be the execution of the first threat Molly Wayne and her imprisoned mate. PHASE FOUR is to elect a new sheriff and Chief of Police that is in agreement with R.A.M. protocols. PHASE FIVE is to buy up Micheal York's land to insure that a proper businessman controls good ranching land and shuts down that moron's vineyard for good. As God wills it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we got him,&quot; I commented holding up the manual and tossed it to Officer Barnes, &quot;he's written down his plan. Has it all down in phases and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes looked through the notebook and then sighed, &quot;Damn.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then double checked something. He began checking several receipts he had with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The guy's a swindler,&quot; Officer Barnes commented.<br />
<br />
I came closer. Officer Barnes held up two receipts for me to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;He had R.A.M. members give donations for the survival of the organization, and according to the list, all the members made donations on the same day,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke, &quot;likely the first day they met, like dues to a union or a club or something of that nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes then motioned to the receipt, &quot;the first is dated the day after the date the donations were made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; I nodded again, &quot;and the other comes from about two months before. Molly and I hadn't come out here yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at the account number,&quot; Officer Barnes urged, &quot;clubs that take membership dues generally keep their own books and have their own account. Beauregard took all of their donations and put it in his OWN pocket. Not into a separate account that he just happened to control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; I spoke as noticed the same account numbers, &quot;he swindled his own people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means he likely fed then nothing but lies to begin with,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;I trust you and Molly never threatened to eat all his cattle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say Molly did, but that was when we first arrived here,&quot; I answered, &quot;I was still human at the time. He offered Molly a job attacking bears, wolves, mountain lions, wolverines... basically any predator that came on his land. We took offense to it, and Molly made him a deal. She'd do it so long as he built us a home on ground we wanted, paid her well above minimum wage and allowed her to set her own hours, and allowed her to kill one cow a month to suit her needs as a tiger for fresh meat, knowing he'd reject the deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he did reject the deal?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is the first time I've been on his land since then,&quot; I told him, &quot;Molly still has not been back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wanted Molly to attack predators on his land?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He claimed they would be a direct threat to his cattle and would allow her to skirt the laws against poaching,&quot; I answered, &quot;but I assumed he was trying to set up some way to have an excuse to wipe out the reintroduced wolves in this area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes then turned to his walkie-talkie and contacted the station, &quot;Dispatch, you may want to send a Game Warden or two to Beauregard's ranch. Tell them to check his sheds and buildings for any possible signs of poaching wolves and or other predators.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then made our way out. As we made it to the front door, we were greeted by a gunshot.<br />
<br />
BLAM!<br />
<br />
It was a shotgun blast that caught Officer Barnes in the gut. The shot sent him tumbling back into me, and blood pouring out of the open wound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid fucking Liberal turd!&quot; Beauregard growled, holding onto a shotgun, &quot;you think because you can lie to earn a badge and get some judge to scribble on a peace of paper makes you think you can take me in? You got no right, boy, never have, never did!&quot;<br />
<br />
I backed up as Beauregard advanced, gun aimed at me. I could see Officer Barnes chocking on his own blood, spitting it into the air as he tried to breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried to make it so that you and your little fucking girlfriend could live and enjoy your bestiality in some other place where people are just naturally stupid,&quot; Beauregard answered, &quot;really I did. But you and that fucking girlfriend of yours refuse to listen to reason. I am the richest man here in Columbia Falls. By that right I am the &quot;king&quot; here. Not you. Not the chief of police, arrogant turd that he is. Not the judge that refused to listen to my money. Not the mayor and the city council who got scared of some fucking liberal who can't even solve a gang attack in his own town, let alone understand where animals are supposed to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave my father out of this,&quot; I answered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Beauregard roared and slammed the barrel of the shotgun into my gut.<br />
<br />
Stronger muscles aside, the blow to the wind out of me and dropped me to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid fucking liberal,&quot; Beauregard answered, &quot;you're what's wrong with this country! You fucking liberals. You all argue for animal rights and all that sort of bullshit, and what you never learn is that animals have NO RIGHTS! None whatsoever. God didn't give animals rights in the Bible. He made them for man to control and sacrifice to him! But you fucking liberals refuse to put animals like you and that Lion in their place.&quot;<br />
<br />
I answered with a defiant growl. It didn't sound like much, but I also hadn't gotten my breath back yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, now, I'm going to do just that,&quot; Beauregard vowed and raised the barrel of the shotgun so that it was between my eyes, &quot;first you and then that whore you call a wife!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you say that about my niece!&quot; came Frank Rhoer's voice from the background as he suddenly appeared from behind Beauregard and tackled the man from behind.<br />
<br />
Frank's sudden attack sent the shotgun flying through the air, and discharging into an open doorway. Frank tried to pin Beauregard down, but the crazed man managed to elbow him in the face, and began to look for his gun again. He never got the chance as I grabbed him by one wrist as I got back to my feet and swung him in the hallway until he hit the wall to the right of me like Beauregard was a man sized doll. I heard a sicking crack come from his arm near the shoulder when he hit the wall. The man screamed with pain as I began to drag him out of the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you broke his arm,&quot; Frank Rhoer said from behind me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; I answered, &quot;He killed my partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nessie is giving him first aide, and an ambulance should be on the way,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully he makes it,&quot; I sighed, &quot;at my size I can't drive a normal car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nessie will do her best,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;He'll live to make it to the hospital. It'll be up to them once he gets there.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't answer as I carried Beauregard out. He was still screaming with pain as I tossed him into the back of the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;George...&quot;<br />
<br />
I then looked up to Frank Rhoer who was standing nervously by me as I stood next to the car. I could see Nessie putting pressure on Officer Barnes' stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never intended for him to do what he's done to you or to Molly,&quot; Frank said slowly, &quot;I only staid here because Beauregard's the only one who gave me a job and the only one that would keep me and my girls on. I've tried other places. Really. Beauregard's been the only one who gave me a job, a livelihood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I commented, &quot;then why didn't you tell him he was wrong? Tell him you disagreed with him? Defend Molly or myself? He came after Molly right away and she was your blood family and you did nothing. That had to have given him a sense of power that he didn't deserve, and look what it's led to. One officer seriously... probably mortally wounded. Your boss looking at criminal charges, and you and your daughters have in a sense lost your jobs. Was it really worth the lack of effort you made to defend Molly when you had the chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Frank Rhoer answered slowly, &quot;...but I never thought him capable of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you do,&quot; I answered as I leaned into the front seat of the car and activated the radio, &quot;dispatch, we have evidence and Pierre Beauregard in custody. The lunatic has shot Officer Barnes. A ranch hand has already called for an ambulance, which should be on its way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gut-shot with shotgun at moderate range,&quot; I answered, &quot;a different ranch hand helped in his arrest and capture... though I think I ended up breaking an arm in the struggle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll get units out there pronto,&quot; the dispatch officer answered.</p>
