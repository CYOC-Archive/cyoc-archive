Instagram: simple_smiles_everyday </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan drifted into sleep with excitement of the freedom he will be having this weekend at home alone and also with his newest game. Waking up, he realized he was holding his phone with the app open. Thankfully charged, he stretched his 5&#39;2&quot; self on the Disney sheeted bed and let out a morning moan in his soft voice. Twiddling on the phone screen with his thumb, an idea had struck him. Waking up home alone as a kid is exciting sure but imagine the life of a full-grown man waking up on a weekend off. This calls for a fun time to touch the Chronviac. With a quick few strokes, he entered the age 25 over his current 10. The stats begin to string around data as it auto adjusted to what he would become giving his current state. It seemed like a fine form, but Ethan wanted to dramatize the experience by fully morphing himself into the peak of masculinization. A walking Adonis of a man instead of a normal 10-year-old boy sounds like fun to be. It would feel like he had become his strong Warrior Avatar from some games he previously played. These characters had always sparked certain emotions within him that was hard for him to talk about with his best friend, but the Chronviac seemed to know all information and because of that, there was nothing to hide here. In an adult body, perhaps he could express himself different. Ethan decided to adjust his stats of his future body to that of his fantasizes that lived within his dreams.<br />
<br />
Height: 6&#39;6&quot;<br />
Feet: Size 15<br />
Body Type: Muscular, Broad, Toned, Cut, Vascular, one of a Herculean God.<br />
Body Hair: Light Hair to compliment all muscles <br />
Libido: 9/10<br />
Cock: 7 inches soft, 12 inches hard equipped with tennis balled sized balls for max production of testosterone and hormonal perfection.<br />
Features: Deeply cut, furrowed brow, smooth voice, diamond cut jawline, light colored eyes, strong nose and luscious lips.<br />
Hair: Blonde (He had enjoyed how he looked last night, might as well take it into his adult form he thought.)<br />
<br />
Hitting enter, the screen flashed blue and beginning typing out &quot;Shifting in motion&quot; with his 3D model behind it beginning to take form. With a sudden gasp, Ethan arched his back as the changes began to feel intense with a tingling energy begging from his small crotch and expanding through his slender body as if it was a flower blossoming outward. Puberty struck as his own DNA and hormones began to restructure thanks to the altering technology of his new application. With another deep breath, the sensations began to focus on his boyish feet as his overall frame began to slowly elongate to add inches in height one by one. His size 5 soles began to expand, and his toes gained some strength in their joints to elongate into the sizes of a man&#39;s. They began to grow and push forward through his socks, tearing them quickly as they expanded wanting to be freed and ready to support the hulk of an Adonis. One by one his toes fill in just a tad more and extend themselves away from his soles. He flexed his feet and with a pop and an alarming gasp, Ethan&#39;s boyish feet shoot up to size 12. With a second moan they quickly push outward to make up for its sudden length and once the wideness of his new soles set in, his new foot sized settled at 15.  His smooth calves began to quake with power and the shin bones lengthened and the muscle began to fill in to create a diamond cut piece of meat that seemed as if it was crafted to run for decades straight. Ethan&#39;s knee&#39;s buckle to prepare for the incoming man weight that was about to explode onto him. With a thrust upward, his childish hips expand to make room as well for his lower body to be completely transformed. <br />
<br />
His starry skied PJs begin to strain as manly thighs begin filling and expanding with raw power. With a shudder, his ass beings lifting him higher up from the bed and his hole even changing in size becoming more sensitive for the future of exploration. With a moan, two bulbous manly cheek burst outward, revealing themselves and tearing behind of the PJs apart. Ethan&#39;s balls began to suddenly fill with Jock seed at such a rapid rate that he could look down and see the bulge in his crotch growing ever so quickly. Every heartbeat filled his growing cock with blood as it hardened for the first time at 4 inches. Ethan could not help but giggle at the site of his boyish torso being attached to such a powerful lower body. He knew he was finally growing into the man he really wanted to be. Pleasure filled his veins, and he throws his head back for the first time moaning and filling the room with his soft voice. It immediately lowers in octaves as his balls drop and fill to tennis ball sized cum factories looking for release. Ethan had to reach down and feel how massive his new genetic maker felt in his baby like hands. These were his and were part of what a Godlike Man needed. He giggled in excitement of the testosterone he could feel beginning to course through his veins.  Every thrust upward with his new strong legs tear his PJ&#39;s apart and add an inch his new manhood. 5, 6, 7 ... eventually Ethan stares in awe at his new meat stick of 12 inches. Rock hard and thick it glistened as he witnessed pre-cum leaking from its large mushroom head. He had not known his body could produce this before. Almost instinctively he reached towards it with his small hand, with a light touch his body convulses again in pleasure wanting to complete his transition into manhood so that he may feel his first and full release of power.  <br />
<br />
Ethan arches his space and stretches his arms behind him allowing for his spine to begin cracking and elongating slowly to push him upwards to his new height. With two sudden jerks, his shoulders broaden left and right, tearing apart his thin starred shirt to expose a new frame that was ready to pack on mass of man muscle. Before that, he lifted his arms in awe to watch as his palms pulsed outward to large sizes enough to palm a basketball. His fingers aggressively contorted as if they were broken, Ethan felt no pain but instead pleasure as they suddenly shifted back but into a larger and longer size with knuckles balancing themselves into place to adjust to their knew size. Manly mitts for holding and lifting is what he now owned. Forearms extending as if they were putty and elbows suddenly shifting to his side as his upper arms make room for what would be propelling strong movements forward. A rumbling began again from his stomach, but not one of hunger, one of desire and lust ready to burst out in physical form to take over Ethan and form him into the peak of masculinity he believed in.<br />
<br />
His waist began to tighten with muscle to prepare for anew core that would grant Ethan an immovable support. With every breath, waves of muscle were beginning to layer over themselves on his abdomen. First an Adonis belt began to cut itself into this groin area, leading all down to a Godly cock. A two-pack formed beginning from the bottom set and then slowly reconstructing themselves as ridges of muscle and cobblestone shapes began to dance among his forming 8 pack. Ethan could not help but crunch and as he did, his eye sparkled at the shapes of his washboard abs. He ran a finger along them and shuddered at how solid they felt. When he reached the top, he suddenly was pulled to the sides again feeling as if he was expanding. Ethan&#39;s traps begin to pulse outward and filling him with power that he did not know one could have His back followed from his traps as the muscles began to fan out to leave behind a skinny frame and to form a broad one of a hunky man. He felt as if he had wings with his traps size and could not help but reach around his now toned obliques to feel pure man muscle in his large hands. He chuckled and with now warning, one pectoral burst outward with muscle, shoving his growing quarter sized nipples down and forward. Ethan gasped from the new sensitivity his man nips seemed to exude. He giggled and reached for his strong pec and as he did, the other followed at a slower pace which allowed him to watch as two bulbous manly pecs created a shelf of meaty muscle right in his field of view. Suddenly they bounced as if they had a mind of their own. Ethan&#39;s jaw dropped; he had seen men who could bounce their chests on cartoons but now he was big enough to where he could. With every flex he chuckled, one muscle tit and the other follows, flaring forward expanding his manly form even more. Ethan proudly clasped his chest like a Gorilla to feel how the large muscle deflects his hand. &quot;Yes! I am so strong!&quot; He could not help to yell and was startled at how the room vibrated at his now baritone and smooth silky voice that would charm anyone&#39;s ears. He placed a hand on his shifting neck to realize his Adam&#39;s apple had pushed forward tremendously. He had no idea he even had one! &quot;So big. Strong. Hot...&quot; he says, his new cock leaking pre-cum just from hearing the voice of the body it was made to serve. Groping his new meaty pecs, Ethan began to watch as his thin arms flexed ever so slightly as muscle began to target his noodle like arms that were attached to jockish hands. <br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s forearms began to pulse forward and gain vascularity to compliment the large muscles that would deserve all sorts of attention. Clenching his large hands causes Ethan&#39;s forearms to pulse outward and his triceps and biceps as well as if they had been in the gym with endless manly grunts for many years. Ethan could feel his triceps fill behind him and with a chuckle he knew it was time to do a double bicep pose which pushed his wingspan outward with the shifting sounds of his growing bones and his biceps tearing itself apart to suddenly peak upwards into meaty biceps a Roman Gladiator would have to lift his large weapons. He remained in this pose for a moment to bask in the strength he now acquired. Another wave grazes his back and as he arches it backward in a stretch while extending his large hands up to his boyish face; muscle begins layering over itself behind him which has Ethan feeling his new strong core thanks to his new upper torso. He would never feel the aches or pains of a normal body as he forever placed his new form in its healthy and virile prime time of existence. Just by flexing his back in a forward motion, he could feel his mass expand as the muscles peaked from enjoying being used to show off so others could marvel at his alpha male size. He reveled in it for a moment by twisting and stretching to his new height to feel all of who he had become. With a sneeze of energy that quickly invaded his nostrils, facial features began to leave behind boyhood and shift into that of adulthood. A soft nose grew and became long and strong complimented by a furrowed brow, high cheek bones and deep eyes that now seemed to glisten with any hint of light. Lips became plump for kissing and his jaw aggressively shot outward and piqued in a way to from a diamond cut jawline that all would envy. His ears shift into a cute size that move along a new hairline that thickened with brown youthfulness and volume as it lengthened slightly and fell to the right to create an attractive hairstyle inspired by modern looks.  &quot;Wow...&quot; Is all Ethan could say in his new deep voice. The changes almost felt complete, but he knew what he had to do to complete this transformation. His cock twitched with pleasure as it begged for attention. Ethan licked his lips and reached slowly with new long arm and grasped his manhood and began thrusting with new strength, eyeing every new muscle that would flex with just a simple thrust. Subtle details began to fill his body as he felt his orgasm build up. Body hair appearing on every muscle to compliment them even more, so they look bigger, stronger and more masculine. Every edge of muscle became cut, so that no matter which way Ethan moved, his Jockish form would dance and show off in a way that would inspire sculptures. A smile is flashed to reveal his new adult smolder that could be on billboards. No pain was ever felt, just the pleasure of becoming the man Ethan wanted to finally be.  The moans of a man began to echo in the house and the app clicked with a happy chime saying &quot;Complete.&quot; A question appeared on screen as our new Hunky Ethan fell into a haze of masculine self-love. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any other changes?&quot;</p>
