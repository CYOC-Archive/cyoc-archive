<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brent, Elise, Danna, and Mikkie all went to New York. What they seen was a surprise. Somehow, someone got some dino DNA and copied what Snowy and Maurice had done for Elise. They had made it to JFK airport, and had hoped that it hadn&#39;t spread outside of Manhattan, but, sadly, it did. Brent was reluctant at making sure shi could use hir stinger to vaccinate. Fortunately Dave had made an adjustment to turn hir venom into the vaccine. They had walked out and they knew the first target was to be at the UN building. Once there, they had to go inside to find the only people inside were the consulate, and... they were all various dinokats and they were... fucking each other. Brent walked up to one and stung the Chinese Ambassador. Once the vaccine took hold shi fell back rubbing hir head. Having blacked out, shi didn&#39;t know what shi did. But it was good news that the vaccine had worked. Once they were sure they started to vaccine all those there.<br />
<br />
Once the ambassadors were vaccinated they took into account of what had happened. Mikkie spotted only one had not changed. And shi began pursuit. However the others were making sure the rest were okay. Once the consulate was calmed down, they had asked what was going on. Danna had told them that they had guessed that the North Korean government was behind it, but not for sure. The Russian Ambassador made a phone call to the president of Russia, who was friends with the North Korean Government, and told him to send some troops in to investigate. If it were true, the North Korean Government would be placed under international arrest.<br />
<br />
Danna looked at them as they had sat down and made the building a headquarters. As all settled down, Mikkie came back with two people, dragging them by the collar of their shirts. Shi tossed them down. When they realized it was both North and South Korean Ambassadors, they had ordered the governments nearby to put both North and South Korea under international arrest. Until further investigations were conducted. Danna had explained that they had planned on such an incident occurring, so had prepared a spare building in Janace for them to meet. They had escorted them out, the Ambassadors bound and dragged to go face punishment in the Janace Prison. Once they were safe they had set to work on the vaccination of the worlds largest city. New York.  But first they had to figure a perfect place to get a view of the area they had to work with. So they scaled the Empire State building. Once there, they had looked around, and as they did, it had seemed the entire city was now outbreak central. Brent had been using one of them view things and spotted something. &quot;Shit. Danna, you may want to look at this. I don&#39;t think New York is the only one infected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Shi walked over to look. &quot;Fuck. We&#39;re going to need help.&quot; Shi then called home.<br />
<br />
The only one shi was able to reach was Maria. &quot;Hello, Danna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria, we got a problem. The outbreak is big. I mean all the other outbreaks were minor compared to this. We are looking at the extent of the outbreak now. We are going to need anyone who isn&#39;t pregnant.&quot; Shi said. &quot;We are looking into New Jersey, and.... well, seems that it goes further than that. I would advice having Casey looking at the extent of the outbreak via satalite. We also have good news. The vaccine works. You may need to have Charlie go too. My advice is head to DC, and have a team head to Phili and we do a back burn, vaccinating the full area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear you loud and clear,&quot; Maria responded as the two hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s get to work.&quot; Danna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you tell hir that the UN will be there with two prisoners?&quot; Mikkie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. I&#39;ll call on the way down. Come on you three.&quot; Danna started down. Brent had decided to literally test his new found legs and scaled the walls of the Empire State Building. Vaccinating everyone they met on the way down, Brent had made it down before them and set to work. Danna, Mikkie and Elise soon joined in. &quot;Okay, here&#39;s the plan. We can&#39;t do this together. So, all four of us will go our own seperate ways. Remember, they are lust filled, don&#39;t hold it against them if you get raped attempt. Unless you see they are lust filled. Snowy did show that we can prevent by extra muscles in our pussies, so they&#39;d only rape our asses. So let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna had headed north, Brent headed to Jersey, by way of the tunnel, and considering Shi&#39;d out do anyone who&#39;d attempt to rape hir, Mikkie went east and Elise went South.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
When Night came, Mikkie had made it to the water, having vaccinated people, fortunately shi still had plenty of vaccines left. Shi, however was tired and had to rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boo.&quot; Came Chris who popped out of the water.<br />
<br />
Mikkie looked. &quot;Hi Chris, Perfect timing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that, Mik?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The outbreak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Raul told me. That&#39;s why I made a trip to Miami to get my friends who were the dolphins turned Dolpkats. Christina is helping Brent, with some sharkats. Also my bros are here too, also to lend a hand. So let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikkie smiled and was relieved so radioed that help had arrived in the NYC, well Manhattan anyway.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brent had hir hands full when backup arrived. Christina and the other Sharkats had started to vaccinate to help hir out.<br />
<br />
Brent was full of relief that this wasn&#39;t going to be getting out of control. &quot;Good of you to show, Christina.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think we&#39;d let you all have all the fun, Brent?&quot; Shi giggled. &quot;Look, we&#39;re here to help, besides, why should the US become Kats States of America?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent giggled. &quot;True.&quot; Shi was walking, and stopped by an alley. Shi had spotted a child, scared half to death. Shi was very young, and about.... six years old. Brent knelt down and rubbed hir cheek. &quot;Sweety, where&#39;s your mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi looked. &quot;Mommy threw me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Where?&quot;<br />
<br />
The little girl pointed to the door as Brent walked to the door. Shi knocked on it and a woman walked up. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, your daughter is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You fuck, I have no daughter.&quot; Shi held up a bat and swung. &quot;Fine, if you don&#39;t care that much, you bitch...&quot; Shi backed up and walked to the side of the house and picked up the little kat. &quot;Come sweety, I&#39;ll take you to a place you&#39;ll be loved.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kat had climbed onto Brent&#39;s back as they continued their job. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kila.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Brent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kila had hugged Brent and even through hir tough exoskeloton, shi felt hir purring. Shi had saber teeth, a sign that some of the kats may be saberkats. But it wasn&#39;t just the purring shi felt. It was the fact this child felt safe. Brent had smiled and kept going. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to love being a mom. Starting with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi said, Kila having fallen asleep. Brent and Christina, along with the sharkats had made a huge dent in the area, but once they got to the edge of the city, they found that they were just beginning in Jersey.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Danna didn&#39;t run into such luck as back up until shi found hirself heading into Brooklyn. Once there shi met up with some millitary personel who was more than happy to lend a hand. Danna had walked up to the General, and found him to be the Secretary of Defense. &quot;Hello sir, what brings you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Maria got hold of us, we were just north in Buffalo when we got the call so... figured we&#39;d help. Right about now, the FBI should be meeting Elise as well. So, shall we kick this in the ass?&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
They had began to make progress going through New York.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Just as the Sec Def said, Elise had encountered the Feds in the form of Maria and Juan. The two smiled. &quot;Hello Elise. Need an extra pair of hands? How about twenty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Yes I do.&quot; Shi smiled. Unlike the others however, Elise, and the reason behind hir becoming a Rapkat was hir speed. Shi had gotten into Queens fast, vaccinating as shi went along. But now, shi can be sure to catch it as shi went.<br />
<br />
However a discovery came when Juan told them DC just got hit too. And it was spreading south.<br />
<br />
Elise looked.&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we had foresight enough to predict it. Danna called home to let them know the possibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. That is very good foresight indeed, Elise.&quot; Maria said.<br />
<br />
As they battled their way in New York and New Jersey, making progress in their areas, the Virus had struck hard. The most populated area in the country, had the largest outbreak in the world to date. And now, They were just making a dent in it.</p>
