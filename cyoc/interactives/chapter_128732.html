<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A man walked down the street one rainy evening. He was a normal man with a normal life, 1.7 meters tall with short cut medium brown hair and green eyes. He was not ugly, he was not handsome. He went to wait for the bus back to his apartment in the rain shelter near the bus station bench. sharing the bench in the corner was a woman, quiet and still with her hands on her knees facing away from him. She had a thin athletic build on the tall side, wore a woman&#39;s business suit, professional shoes, had dark brown hair in a bob hair cut. At first glance bob thought that she was rather pale. On a second glass she looked chalk white. That was enough to get him a proper look at her. She not only had alabaster skin, but it was glossy and rubbery.<br />
<br />
This was enough to get him interested. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; He said, not knowing how to follow it up. While he was gathering his thoughts she stirred and tilted her head towards him and he saw it. Or rather the lack of it.<br />
<br />
She had no brows, no nose, no mouth, no eyes. No face. Just a heart shaped blank expanse of mannequin like rubbery skin. Then suddenly she darted out. Two nailess hands darted out and grabbed his wrists, pulling them apart with more strength than he imagined possible. She brought the front of her blank head in closer as he felt a strange sensation as liquid poured out of her fingertips through thousands of small pores onto his skin and burrowed. He wanted to scream, but the words for some reason could not clear his throat. For ten seconds she held her grip before releasing him, back on the bench. She (whatever she was) stood there facing him with her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
After a few coughs his voice came back &quot;Who...WHAT are you?!&quot; He said as his put his hand to his face. Then he noticed something was off, it seemed small and...rubbery. He pulled it back and watched as his hands changed. They became pale as chalk, gained a glossy sheen and slimmed. He rubbed them together and felt a squeaky smooth surface. Then he felt other changes happen. His waist suddenly tightened, his shoulders narrowed, his hips bubbled out slightly, two mounds formed on his chest and he felt shiftings in his nether regions as his penis and testacles gradually receded into &#39;his&#39; body.<br />
<br />
He looked up at the strange faceless women. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot; he said in a softer higher voice. With that she reached down to his increasingly pale softening face and laid a single finger on his lips for an second. As she removed it, he felt a strange sensation as his mouth began to shrink. He let out a feminine scream as this happened which was muffled. Soon it had shrunk to the size of a navel, then the skin nearly fused together melted away. Inside his mouth he felt his jaws lock into place and his tongue inflate to fill the cavity until there was nothing he could precieve of it. His nostrils sealed up at the same time and his nose soon receded. To his suprise he did not choke, or feed a need to breathe at all. But those thoughts were soon burried as he blinked in fear, but his right eye refused to open and his left eye. The last thing that he (who was now distinctly a she) saw was the strange women waving.<br />
<br />
Then came a new sensation came to her. Faint at first, but growing in clarity. She could sense the bench. It&#39;s shape and it&#39;s texture, which resonated as a 3D object in her mind. Then the concrete and the glass of the shelter and shortly after that, the strange women, staring at her with her arms crossed. She sensed her form, her clothes, her body. Then she sensed herself and found that beyond the hair, which was still short cut but growing out. She rubbed her smooth face, confirming it. But to her surprise she did not fear anymore. She found it&#39;s smooth form a thing beyond beauty, it was a thing of magnificence.<br />
<br />
Then a thought came into her mind *I knew you would like it.* It was not words, it was a shadow of sensation and ideas. She knew that it had come from without, from the strange woman.<br />
<br />
*What are you? What are we?* He asked?<br />
<br />
*I, like you, have been refined. Perfected. Made into a being of strength, grace, intelligence and beauty, complete and flawless. My old life is not important. Nor that sound that I used to identify myself. Nor is yours now.*<br />
<br />
The newly created duplicate thought about this. *Yes. I agree fully.*<br />
<br />
*I know you would* The older one replied. *Why would anyone want to be human when they could be like us?*<br />
<br />
*Of course. But there are a few things you should know before we continue...* With that, the older one gave her a deluge of information, of a great plan. A dozen faceless ones had been brought into this city alone, with thousands of them deployed around the world. There were more now, the one that had just made her into what she is now had made three more faceless ones already. Now was the time to fix all of humanity. Soon there would be no more hatred, no more crime, no more division, no more war, no more poverty. Just seven billion identical interchangeable loving sisters just like her.<br />
<br />
The bus stopped then. Two Faceless Ones got on, twenty three Faceless Ones soon got off.</p>
