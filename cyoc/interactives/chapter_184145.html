<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>About the word Râkshasa, I took the name from an Hindu myth that has little to do with the species described here. (Although their &quot;combat form&quot; look a bit like creatures in some RPGs video-games that use this same name.)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After having improved the life of everyone&#39;s in his family, Colin decided to put the Journal of Facts for the time being. He needed to think carefully of his next move.<br />
<br />
Once they were finally at home, the first thing Colin did was to place the Journal of Facts on the table so he would have his hands free to help his family transport their baggage in the house. But said journal was bored and, as a result, used its powers to make the first person to see it unable to resist the urge to use it, even if they wouldn&#39;t be aware they would rewrite reality.<br />
<br />
Said person just happened to be Jane, Colin&#39;s super-star twin-sister. Her life as a teen-star might be exhausting, it still made her happy, and she wished her brother would find something that would made him as happy and fulfilled as she was. Why not finding himself a girlfriend?<br />
<br />
Under the influence of the Journal of Facts, Jane started not only writing about the ‘imaginary’ world in which her brother had a girlfriend, but also illustrating it.<br />
<br />
She knew how much he liked fantasy, (to be honest, so did she) so she wrote that magic was real, but very few human had the ability. But human weren&#39;t the only humanoid species able to create civilizations. Some of these other species had an easier time doing magic, but not all of them. But all those ‘civilized’ species were genetically compatible, but the offspring of a mixed couple would generally end up being of whatever species was dominant in its DNA. True hybrid were rare, only born when the DNA strands specific of each parent species where present in equal numbers in their child.<br />
<br />
That said, Hybrid couples were rather rare. Not so much because of xenophobia, even if it did exist (and was generally considered a problem in modern days) than because each species had their own cultures and technologies.<br />
<br />
Somehow, it didn&#39;t stop Colin from finding himself a non-human girlfriend. Aditi is what some humans derogatorily call a ‘beast-kin’, the proper name of her species being Râkshasa. Ordinarily, a Râkshasa look mostly human, just with canines a bit more prominent, often with a slightly pointed hears and sometimes with cat-like iris. But Râkshasas have more than one form, which had caused most other species to see them as monsters in the past.<br />
<br />
They also have a ‘combat form’, which look like an humanoid feline, and a fully animalistic form ideal to go somewhere fast. In this second form, an adult can transport a person on its back. (Two if they don&#39;t need to go too far.)<br />
<br />
While Râkshasas generally have a lot of magic, few of them are able to cast spells, and only minor ones. Their magic is used more innately. Not only do they use their magic to transform, but it also grant healing propriety to their saliva, and let them make their retractile claws poisonous if they wish to do so. With the appropriate training, they could do the same to a blade.<br />
<br />
But Aditi is a special case. Kidnapped at 3 by a malevolent wizard who used a forbidden magic to turn her into his slave and experimented on. And even her name, she only remember it because the other slaves/guinea pigs used it to call her. The wizard for his part insisted in using a number to call her.<br />
<br />
5 years later she met Colin, a 8 years old human freshly kidnapped by the same wizard. (He experimented on <strong>every</strong> sentient species.) Thankfully, it only took one month after his kidnapping to find him.<br />
<br />
The police was able to free most of the evil wizard&#39;s slaves, but not all. Some because they were members of a long-lived species who had been turned into slaves generations ago, the wizard being only their latest master, others because the enslaving spell had been cast on them very young. In both cases the spell had integrated itself with their inner magic, to the point it couldn&#39;t be dispelled anymore.<br />
<br />
Usually, when a slave can&#39;t be freed, the government of their species call upon a trustworthy person to be their master, someone they know will offer them a life as normal as possible. But during the month they had known each others, Aditi & Colin had become more than just misfortune companions, they had become close friends and the young Râkshasa was so fearful of loosing her friend, it became impossible to make anyone but Colin her master, not without causing her a slow and painful death.<br />
<br />
After debating with the Râkshasan government, and since Aditi had clearly no recollection of Râkshasan culture, to the point she didn&#39;t even remember their language, and after testing Colin&#39;s character, and explaining to him and his parents the situation and why he shouldn&#39;t abuse his powers over Aditi and do everything to give her a life as normal as possible. While Colin wasn&#39;t happy with this responsibility, he would have been even less so if his friend died, and his parents didn&#39;t want to be the one who killed his friend, someone he had found comfort and had comforted while in the hands of a madman.<br />
<br />
When Colin&#39;s parents firs saw the young Râkshasa, they first believed her to be a boy, albeit one with long hairs, but seeing the wizards other slaves it was clear the madman thought cutting their hairs would be a loss of time he could otherwise use to experiment on them. The mages sent to help with freeing the slaves and ‘transferring’ the ones that couldn&#39;t be freed then prepared Colin so he could be liked to Aditi as her master, the spell also making a mark appear, covering the back of his hand, indicating that he was authorized by the USO (for <strong>U</strong>nited <strong>S</strong>pecies <strong>O</strong>rganization), to have a slave, before doing the actual transfer.<br />
<br />
As soon as the transfer was done, Aditi hugged Colin, crying, calling him &quot;Master, master, master&quot; not realizing how she would grow to despise her newfound inability to call him by name, nor that Colin already did hate it.<br />
<br />
Nowadays Aditi is still a tomboy, albeit a cute one.<br />
… At least when she don&#39;t disguise herself as a man. (Albeit a girlish one.) She started doing this once Colin and her got enrolled in the International School of Magic. (More about the ISM another time.) At first it was for fear of being separated from Colin, not wanting to sleep in another room, let alone another dorm. Now it&#39;s because she decided to act as his bodyguard (not that he really need one) and being a girl nobody took her seriously, regardless of her far greater strength as a Râkshasa.<br />
<br />
She has a dark skin and black hairs in a short and messy cut, blue cat-like eyes, the muscles of someone practicing a martial arts, small B-cup breasts, but still have a nice hourglass figures (even if she became an expert at hiding it). She&#39;s very intelligent, but also very protective of Colin and very insecure about their romance, always fearing that Colin would find himself a more feminine girlfriend, (even though he prefer tomboys) with a bigger chest (forgetting he prefer smaller boobs), and the fact she will always see him as her master first and foremost would help the other girl taking her place as his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
In her ‘combat form’ she is covered in black fur, with tiger-stripes of a slightly darker shade black the way black panther have similarly darker spots on their already black fur. A more feline face with triangular hears on top of her head, retractile claws in her fingers and toes but still walk like a human would, and have a long cat-looking but prehensile tail which end with a black tuff of fur in similar a similar way to a lion&#39;s. Her last form is just a cat big enough to be used as a horse, but still with black stripes on black fur and a black tuft at the end of her tail.<br />
<br />
Whatever the form, she is stronger, faster and more nimble than any human can ever hope to be.<br />
<br />
She is Aditi, the one that love Colin, the one Colin love back. Sure, its tiring him always needing to be careful how he say things to her, so he don&#39;t say something that sound like an order, and it hurt them both that she can&#39;t call him by name, even if ordered to. But those are the cards dealt to them, and all they can do is accept it.</p>
