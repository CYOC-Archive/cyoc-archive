<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen kept her eyes firmly shut as she waited for her body to do whatever it was going to do next, she couldn’t bear to watch what else her body, or whatever was controlling her body, was going to make her do. She couldn’t help but feel guilt, fear and shock all rolled into one that she was so powerless to control her own limbs.<br />
<br />
She felt herself turning, her bare feet padding through the grass as she walked around the cow, “Im sorry… im sorry… please… I don’t want to do this…” Jen begged quietly, hoping whatever force was controlling her might listen and release her from this bizarre nightmare.<br />
<br />
But things were about to get much worse, Jen’s eyes shot open in alarm when her hands, instead of reaching for the cow, reached up to her breasts instead and gave them a playful squeeze in her bra before sliding around her back and undoing the garment, tossing it aside. <br />
<br />
Jen, now topless and exposed, without the use of her arms to cover her nudity squealed in shock and fear, “no no no… clothes… I need clothes…” she pleaded weakly with her body even as it ignored her and stroked sensually down her sides, doing a strip tease to no one but the cow and removing her skirt, which she stepped out with a little skip. Now totally naked in the middle of the field Jen mewled and shivered, at least her head did. “p-please let me go…” she begged the air as her hands reached up and started toying with her breasts.<br />
<br />
Jen moaned softly, scared whatever was controlling her body had plans for her beyond just taking the cow apart, “I don’t want… this…” she gasped. But her gasps became screams again when her hands tugged firmly at her breasts and, with an alarming ease her breasts popped off in her hands. Dangling by the nipples, they sloshed about and jiggled as she held them, warm and wobbly, leaving her chest completely flat.<br />
<br />
“No… no please… not me… not my breasts! Please not my breasts!” Jen wailed and begged but her hands ignored her and she could only watch in horror as her hands bounced her breasts playfully back and forth. The second they had disconnected from her body Jen realised she could no longer feel them and she sobbed harder at the loss. She expected her hands to put her breasts with the cow parts, her imagination racing that eventually she and the cow would be nothing but a pile of bits in the middle of this field, but what her body did next was even more terrifying for the teen.<br />
<br />
“Oh no… please no… no… PLEASE… HELP ME!!” Jen begged and then screamed desperately as her hands took her breasts down and lowered them under the cow, holding them side-by-side and then pushing them upwards to where the cow’s udder had been. With a sense of total horror Jen could only watch on when her hands let go, leaving her beautiful perky breasts stuck between the legs like an udder.<br />
<br />
“… my breasts… my beautiful breasts…” she whimpered quietly, watching them get squeezed slightly as the cow took a step with its stumpy back legs. Before she had a chance to process what had happened her hands swept up her tummy and over the flat region of her chest to her face and then around to her ears, rubbing her earlobes briefly before tugging them both, detaching them with a pop.<br />
<br />
Jen’s world was plunged into silence, total and complete silence and she screamed desperately, unable to even hear herself inside her own head, the entire structure of her ears now gone, held in her hands. Tears streamed down her face as she panicked, thinking this was it, she’d be deaf forever. Her hands reached up and attached her cute human ears to the side of the cow’s head, replacing its own and the cow shook its head happily and raised its mouth in a moo that Jen couldn’t hear.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want this!” Jen screamed to the air, not knowing if she was even making a sound. But her terror only grew when her hands suddenly and roughly clasped at her stomach and, with a violent pull that briefly blinded her in a confusing shadow Jen watched in horror as her skin came off in a clean sheet, just as the cow’s had done moments earlier. Beneath, and just like the cow, Jen looked down to see her body was the same white porcelain and she realised without her skin she had lost her sense of touch completely.<br />
<br />
Her hair was still there, blonde and beautiful as it cascaded over her shoulders but Jen now felt even more disconnected from her body, without sound or touch it was like she was watching a horrific nightmare play out in front of her.<br />
<br />
She wanted to close her eyes, not wanting to watch as her body lifted her skin up like a sheet and brought it down around the cow but her eyelids had gone with her skin and she couldn’t look away no matter how hard she tried. Her skin seemed to ripple as it landed on the cow, stretching subtly as it draped over the animal, wrapping around its head and legs and then, without Jen being fully aware of what had happened she realised the cow now had human skin… her skin. Its hairless bronze tan was what she was familiar looking at on her own body, on a cow it looked absurd and yet she was staring at it. A cow, with human breasts where its udder should be and human ears on its head.<br />
<br />
Jen didn’t have to be a genius to guess what her hands would take from her next, even as she cried desperately and begged it not to, “please not those… please… please not my feet…” she sobbed but it was no use, her porcelain white body walked around the back of the cow and stood for a moment, before her hands reached down and disconnected her feet, stepping backwards onto her ankle stumps and leaving her feet behind. She could only watch on in misery as the Cow took a step backwards itself, it’s rear leg stumps fusing seamlessly with the cute human feet that rapidly grew to be covered in their normal skin again.<br />
<br />
In her silent world Jen watched her feet wriggle under the cow’s control and she cried harder, wanting this nightmare to end. But her hands had one final thing to take from her and the cheerleader wailed desperately, thrashing her head left and right trying to stop the inevitable. But it was useless and she whimpered in total sorrow as her hands pulled at her pussy lips and detached it, moving it to the cow and attaching it in place of its original. It looked completely insane, her tiny cute pink little pussy, hairless and glistening, so so small compared to the legs either side of it, her breasts pushed just in front of it, squeezed by the cows huge legs.<br />
“P-please…” Jen begged quietly to the air, “I want my body back…” <br />
<br />
But Jen’s prayer went unanswered and, with all the appropriate parts now on the cow, it seemed to regain its self-control and slowly started to walk away. Jen screamed, wanting to reach out and chase after the animal, watching in horror as its legs squished and squeezed her breasts with ever step, her pussy on total display on its rear, her skin and feet brushing through the grass.<br />
<br />
“This is a nightmare… im dreaming… im dreaming…” Jen mewled to herself as her body turned towards the pile of disembodied cow parts left behind…<br />
<br />
“Oh No… please no…”</p>
