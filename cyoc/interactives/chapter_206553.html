<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the currently paper thin layer of new skin spreads further down her body rather quickly, Anna could no longer see the expansion hidden by her tight minidress but she could feel it. It was warm and it felt surprisingly pleasant, like an affectionate hug. She smiles under the still mouthless, featureless fake face and wondered what she would look like in the end. This was exciting to her almost as much as it was unsettling. <br />
<br />
She suddenly feels a mildly uncomfortable pressure in the chest area and she tenses up. The layer of new skin started pushing down on her breasts with surprising strength as if wanting to compress them, to push them flatter! Her hands shoot to grab at her chest only to meet with an already flat surface. &quot;Mmpf!!&quot; She protests with her muffled voice and rubs her hands frantically up and down over her now breast-less chest. Her slender arms and hands were fully encased in fake skin also by now. <br />
<br />
Anna continues to rub her hands over her chest but slower realizing it won&#39;t accomplish anything. She jolts her eyes toward the Wizard inquisitively. &quot;Mmmph!?&quot; She gives him another muffled protest which sounds both surprised and distressed. She felt so uncomfortable with her chest bound so tightly! <br />
<br />
The Wizard smiles and shrugs. &quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Anna shakes her head &quot;no&quot; but her light blue eyes communicate discomfort and confusion. &quot;Just soldier through it, Anna. I&#39;m sure once you get used to it you&#39;ll feel less constricted.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna nods hoping he&#39;s right. She was in for another shock though as the fake skin reached below her hips, encasing her pelvic area and ass and going over her pussy. She can feel the warm organic substance entering her while simultaneously starting to apply the same constricting force on her nice round butt. &quot;Mmmh...&quot; She moans experiencing both discomfort and sexual stimulation at the same time. Although Anna is a pretty petite, slim young woman and her butt is not particularly big, it&#39;s not flat either and it&#39;s unmistakably feminine so it needed to be reduced and reshaped a bit so it wouldn&#39;t stick out as much. With her breasts bound tightly and her butt nice and flat, Anna now presented much less like an attractive lady, in fact at this point it wasn&#39;t obvious she&#39;s a woman at all which was a big step in the direction the Alter-Ego Mask intended for her to go in. <br />
<br />
As the fake skin continues to quickly travel underneath her black silk panties and latex leggings, expanding down her smooth, thin but shapely legs, Anna gasps when she feels something tingling in her panties. Her pretty blue eyes go wide when she sees a bump starting to form right in the center of her crotch, tenting the form-hugging dress! &quot;MMHH!! MMM!!&quot; She moans in shocked realization and hurries to unzip the tight dress, desperate to better see what was happening to her. She obviously knew the skin-suit was about to give her a penis, it just made sense with the way it first compressed her boobs and ass... She felt an adrenaline rush and her heartbeat accelerating. She wasn&#39;t expecting this, it hadn&#39;t even crossed her mind, she wasn&#39;t ready for this gender-bending twist! And yet it&#39;s happening now whether she is ready or not, whether she likes it or not... Can Anna avoid panicking? <br />
<br />
She fumbles with the zipper on the back of the tight dress, clumsy from the haste so the Wizard decides to help her out. He calmly unzips the dress and pulls it off her over her head then proceeds to hum an eerie tune while he folds the garment neatly. <br />
Feeling sweaty underneath the skinsuit which now covered her body entirely, Anna breathes audibly in a frantic rhythm. Her eyes pointed downwards and transfixed on the growing bulge in her latex tights. Since the latex was so thin and stretchy, she can see the lump of fake meat&#39;s outline begin to refine once it reached an impressive size and stopped growing further. <br />
<br />
At first it was one undefined mass but now she could clearly make out the outline of a full set of male genitalia... a hefty but firm scrotum and a shaft. Although the cock was limp and bended downward over the scrotum, it appeared to be of a very respectable size and pushed the tights forward into a bulge that was hard to ignore. Anna shivers at the sight of it and she is confused on how she was supposed to feel about this... Should she feel repulsed, or maybe...thrilled? Sure she is a pretty kinky lady but is this going too far into weird territory even for her? &quot;Will I be expected to pretend I&#39;m a guy now?&quot; She thinks to herself. She isn&#39;t sure she can pull that off adequately enough. She could still try though, right? Maybe she might actually surprise herself and everyone else, subvert all expectations when it turns out she makes for a good guy... She weirds herself out to think that. &quot;Am I a...trans person now?&quot; Another weird thought popped into her head. <br />
<br />
Anna never in her life thought about this sort of thing, she&#39;s a completely typical, straight woman. A woman can&#39;t just decide to be a man, can she? Still she couldn&#39;t deny the newness of this unexpected turn of events did have some appeal worth exploring... Maybe it&#39;s just a new fetish she was just beginning to develop? Maybe not just a fetish? She can&#39;t be sure, she definitely wasn&#39;t trans though so maybe it&#39;s just her perverted mind finding a new game to play. <br />
<br />
Anna looks into the mirror as she gently explores the new equipment with a fingertip. She runs the finger lightly over the length of the shaft and traces over the ridge of the cock head. She carefully cups the balls and she&#39;s surprised at how sensitive they felt. Yeah, although this is like a sort of costume encasing her body, it&#39;s magical and made of real skin and she can feel through this skin as if it were her own. Well it IS her skin, her new skin technically! <br />
<br />
She can feel the skin tingling again promising further changes and frankly Anna was just curious to let this play out and see the final result. She unclasps her now redundant, loose and empty black bra and hands it to the Wizard feeling new layers of muscle and fat starting to develop between her real skin and her new skin. She caresses her bare chest slowly and watches it expand with some new definition. The shape of masculine pectoral muscles emerges along with a pair of small, dark nipples. It wasn&#39;t overly muscular, just the right amount of definition but considering this new anatomical structure was built on top of a quite prosperous female breast the result was an impressive, fully convincing male chest. <br />
<br />
New volume is added to her waistline to correct that pesky slim hourglass figure, filling it out to achieve the straight, boxy torso Anna needed to become a proper male. Now her body is equally wide from hip to armpit. She even had a bit of love handles and a slightly protruding stomach now like an average guy who eats healthy. Additional muscle padding is also added to fix Anna&#39;s rather narrow and sharp, very lady-like shoulders, expanding them outwards enough to make them appear wider and more rounded like they should be. Her upper back is also expanded just enough to grant her that slight V shape. The slender arms become thicker next, not a lot thicker but just enough to be of appropriate male proportions. The hands follow suit as an extra layer of volume makes them appear a bit bigger, meatier and the fingers shorter and thicker with clipped fingernails, Anna&#39;s black nail polish now hidden from sight. <br />
<br />
With the entire upper body now looking much better, her legs and feet were up next. Similar to her arms, the entire leg just generally thickens all over, erasing the shapely feminine contours in the process, granting her a pair of sturdier, thicker legs. Anna kicks off her black, shiny platform pumps just in time for her dainty feet to grow bigger and decidedly masculine. Her new toenails also clean and cut short just like her fingernails. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m probably a men&#39;s size 9 now.&quot; Anna thinks to herself and she playfully kicks the discarded pumps away from her. &quot;Love these shoes but...yeah... I&#39;m gonna be a guy now so I&#39;m due for a radical change of fashion...&quot; She finds herself musing about trying on and purchasing men&#39;s clothes and honestly it sounded kind of fun! <br />
<br />
Now that Anna the stereotypical and clichéd, hot goth chick was hidden head to toe from sight, bound tightly in layers of new flesh and skin, she was unrecognizable. No one would even suspect that inside this clearly masculine body hides the beautiful, feminine Anna. Even the few tattoos she has were obviously now concealed which is probably for the better to be fair. A tribal, gothic tramp stamp, a black thorny rose right on the left hip and an edgy black cross on the right thigh would no longer fit with the new look... <br />
With the final addition of light body hair all over the now darker skin, only the neck and head were left &quot;unfinished&quot;. It seems the Mask intended to leave that part for last on purpose. <br />
<br />
Anna can see it start to shift, she&#39;ll finally get to have a new face! The neck bulks out a bit to make it appear thicker and shorter, then the adam&#39;s apple forms, pressing against Anna&#39;s real throat. The fake adam&#39;s apple would function like a device to disguise her voice. <br />
She reaches to feel it and instinctively coughs a few times just in time since a mouth opening had finally appeared, allowing her to part her lips and even speak again properly... <br />
When she coughs she can feel her voice start to break, like a teenage boy going through puberty. It took a few seconds for her voice to fully alter into deeper, more masculine tones. &quot;Ahem, testing, testing... Oh wow, this is so weird!&quot; She speaks and she sounded like an actual guy now. <br />
<br />
She feels an intense tingle all over her face and the featureless expanse of skin covering her entire head quickly sculpts itself into a brand new face. It happens so fast and before Anna can observe the process it was already done! She gets closer to the mirror and explores the new features with her hands. <br />
<br />
Her new face looked rather average: Full rounded cheeks as opposed to her elegant fine cheekbones, a more pronounced and a bit wider jaw compared to her own but not by an extreme amount. The chin wasn&#39;t too much bigger than her actual chin but it had more character. The skin on the chin and jaw also looked like she recently shaved. Anna thinks this face might be able to grow a decent amount of facial hair but probably not really a bushy beard. The mouth had fuller lips than hers, though no where near as contoured and kissable... The nose was dramatically different though, her real nose is thin and pointy and petite but now she sported a slightly big nose, nothing ridiculous but it was wider, fleshier and not as straight. <br />
<br />
The eyes were still her sky blue of course since the skinsuit left them uncovered. This was the only part of Anna to remain visible, well along with her teeth, tongue and inner mouth. But even if she had the same eye color the effect was very different under thick male brows and without her long dark lashes, the eyes looked smaller in relation to the thicker, wider face. Even her ears were a bit bigger now and she had no sign of piercings. The hair on her new scalp was a regular brown and cropped short in a modest and practical look. <br />
<br />
She touches her new face all over. Of course she wanted to get well acquainted with this face, this was her face now, in a very practical way this was the new her, well... maybe the new &quot;him&quot; might be more accurate?...</p>
