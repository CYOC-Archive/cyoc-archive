<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everyone had chosen a costume and left for the changing rooms leaving Ryan with only a bikini, Ryan reluctantly picked it up and put it in his pocket. Suddenly Riley ran out of the changing room saying &quot;it was the best thing ever&quot; and things of the such when you asked him what happen&#39;d though he simply stated &quot;grab a costume and find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Unfortunately Ryan had work in 10 minutes so he decided to leave the shop, when Ryan got to work he was glad he left instead of trying on a costume as it was 8:59 a.m. Ryan was a cashier at a clothing store, and so he went on with his day. At 12 p.m Ryan&#39;s 45 min break began and he ate lunch, but still had 2 minuets, so remembering the costume went to the men&#39;s washroom and put the bikini on under his work clothes. He slid the basically panties up his legs after getting fully nude, then after seeing nothing happen reluctantly put the bra on just as he clicked it in his co-worker knocked on the door and informed him break was over, Ryan quickly put his work clothes on top of the bikini because his manager was really strict when it came to clock in times a few minuets late and you would get an earful .<br />
<br />
Ryan rushed out of the stall and back to his register, lucky his boss let him of with a warning of &quot;go to the washroom earlier in the break please.&quot; Thankful Ryan came to his register when he noticed a small bump in his clothes, when he tried to smooth it out he realized that they were his breasts, though to small for Ryan to think his gender had changed, he instead thought his time at the gym was paying off and he was getting pecks.<br />
<br />
The next issue came when an old man came to Ryan&#39;s register, you gave your normal &quot;Hello, how are ya&#39;&quot; as he put his clothes on the counter, Ryan then thought his voice was a bit higher pitch then normal, but nothing to worry about. The old man man responded with &quot;oh good just need some formal clothes is all miss.&quot; Ryan was a bit offended the old man thought he was a woman but, not wanting to cause a scene never said anything. Ryan thought maybe the effect of the clothes is changing how strangers perceive you, if so he got unlucky.<br />
<br />
Ryan went through the day as normal, he didn&#39;t go to the washroom, because if people thought he was a girl it would be weird for the customers plus he didn&#39;t really have to go all day. Ryan got in his car to drive home when he noticed it felt different to sit, Ryan thought he would check when he got home Ryan didn&#39;t get home though. while Ryan was driving home he saw a driver swerving in front of him, Ryan tried to memorize the license plate, but unfortunately the car was to far ahead of him to fully read it. suddenly the driver swerving in front of him stopped, blocking both lanes quickly though Ryan managed to swerve into the ditch causing the airbag&#39;s to go off and everything for him to go black<br />
<br />
Ryan woke up in a hospital bed 1 day later, he was informed what happen&#39;d Ryan got discharged. Before Ryan got discharged he went to the bathroom only to realize he was now a woman, though strangely he was never asked for personal i.d. Though now fully aware he was now female he didn&#39;t mention that to the nurse in case she didn&#39;t know, he just wanted to go home. Ryan was still wearing the costume now for 32 hours, when he got home he took all his clothes off to see boobs and no bulge on the costume Ryan went to bed hoping that this was just a hazy fever dream.<br />
<br />
Ryan woke up bright and early at 6 a.m and called into work, his manager was surprisingly sympathetic and was all for him taking the day off. Ryan now with breasts and a box decided to just accept it, he put some clothes on and went to a clothing store different from his work and got fitted for bra&#39;s and panties. now he had a supply 6 bra&#39;s 6 panties, Ryan then went home. he wonder&#39;d what effect Riley got, so he picked up his phone and called Riley. Riley answered and when asked about it Riley told Ryan about the massive cock he got and how the effects work (i.e the effects will last the same amount of time the costume is worn) Ryan was incredibly relieved by the news. but didn&#39;t tell Riley the confusing hell he had been through.<br />
<br />
Ryan now occasionally changes into a women and &quot;experiments&quot; but other than that he was relieved it was over</p>
