<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was another hour before you changed back. Ember had undressed before the two hours were up and laid you on your bed, expecting you to change back into human form. As you were no longer blind, you could see she became very worried when you didn’t change back. However being an inanimate bra there was nothing you could do. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, after 15 minutes of waiting she thought to check the settings on the magical printer and saw that the duration of the previous sticker was 3 hours and not 2. <br />
<br />
She berated you “Why did you do that? You should have told me that you had extended the duration of your change. How am I going to get home at 10 O’clock at night? I’ll miss the last bus! You will owe me a taxi fare!”<br />
<br />
You couldn’t reply, you couldn’t defend yourself. All you could do was look through your one eye and hope like hell that your mother didn’t come and investigate as to why Ember was still in your room. If she did you decided you would just have to come clean.<br />
<br />
The last half hour went very slowly. Ember had apparently found a book or magazine to read. She was silently reading and you were bored stiff lying where you had been discarded on your bed with a view of your bedspread and the door.<br />
<br />
It was with great relief that you finally re-emerged from the bra. It took a while to reorientate yourself. The feeling of being able to move again was tremendous.<br />
<br />
Ember was not happy with you “How could you do that? I thought I must have somehow got you wet and you were never going to become human again!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. I should have told you I had changed the duration. Please forgive me”<br />
<br />
“I forgive you. It was actually fun to be wearing you and I had a great time until you didn’t change back. How was it for you?”<br />
<br />
“To be truthful, not great. I mean it was fantastic when you first put me on but once you put your shirt over me I became blind. If I ever get worn again make sure I’m something you wear on the outside so I can see what is happening”<br />
<br />
Ember looked dissappointed “Could you hear me?”<br />
<br />
“I could. But I couldn’t reply to your questions. It would be nice to be able to communicate”<br />
<br />
“So you haven’t even seen the shoes I bought?”<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid not. I saw the shirts you were trying on before you buttoned them up. Which one did you end up buying?”<br />
<br />
“The blue satin shirt”<br />
<br />
“Yeah that felt really nice”<br />
<br />
“I think my eyes were the little fabric rose between the bra cups”<br />
<br />
Ember looked puzzled “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“My vision was from between the two cups of the bra. When you stood in front of a mirror I could see a little fabric rose where I thought my eyes were. Mind you my vision wasn’t great. I only had one eye and it was hard to focus. Everything was a bit blurry. It might have been a bow”<br />
<br />
The bra was still lying on the bed. Ember picked it up. “This bra doesn’t have a rose or bow between it’s cups” She showed it to you.<br />
<br />
There was nothing but standard cloth between the two cups “I don’t get it? I’m sure there was something there. Right here” You touched the bra where you had seen the rose.<br />
<br />
Ember appeared to have a lightbulb moment “That’s where the sticker remained after the bra absorbed you. It shrunk to a tiny black square. About so big” she showed the approximate size “I know because I looked carefully. I didn’t want the sticker to be damaged”<br />
<br />
“So it sort of went into camouflage?” The sticker had apparently dissappeared once you had re-emerged from the bra<br />
<br />
“You could say that”<br />
<br />
“We should try again. Do you want a turn? I’ll carefully watch what happens to the sticker” <br />
<br />
“No it’s late. I need to get home. I have my cousin’s wedding tomorrow. I have stayed here long enough. Your Mum will think we are a couple”<br />
<br />
“Would that be so bad?” You held your breath. It was the first time you had hinted that you wanted to be more than a friend to Ember<br />
<br />
Ember looked carefully at you for several seconds before replying “Actually it wouldn’t” a smile came over her face. “But I’m not staying the night. I do have a wedding tomorrow”<br />
<br />
“So would you like to do this another time?” You pointed at the printer<br />
<br />
“Most certainly. Just not tomorrow. I’d invite you to the wedding but I told my cousin I wasn’t bringing a partner. It’s a bit late to add a guest. I’m a bridesmaid”<br />
<br />
“Maybe on Sunday then?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I think so” her face beamed with a smile<br />
<br />
You decided to take a risk and pulled Ember close to you and gave her a kiss on the lips. She didn&#39;t object and kissed you back. It was the positive response you had hoped for.<br />
<br />
However she eventually pulled back “I had better go. It’s late and I’ll need to get a taxi”<br />
<br />
“I’ll ring for one” you immediately dialled for a cab. <br />
<br />
“Thanks”<br />
<br />
“A taxi will be outside in 5 minutes” you informed Ember a minute later<br />
<br />
“Tonight has been fun. I really wish you could be at the wedding with me”<br />
<br />
“Yep…. I wish I could come as well”<br />
<br />
You walked Ember to the front of your driveway. Soon enough a taxi turned the corner. This time Ember initiated the kiss. <br />
<br />
“Actually….. Maybe you could come” mused Ember as she broke off her embrace</p>
