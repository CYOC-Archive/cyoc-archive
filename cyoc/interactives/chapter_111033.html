<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sure I guess.&quot; Jesse said, unsure if he actually wanted to change back. Nick noticed that and smirked. &quot;Actually I have an idea.&quot; Nick said as Jesse looked up, his breasts jiggling as he did so. &quot;What idea?&quot; Jesse asked as Nick smirked. &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; Nick said as he walked over to his room before closing the door. Jesse huffed as he went back to sitting in the sun, twirling his finger through his vines like it was natural.<br />
<br />
Inside his room Nick was typing away at the chronovac. He wanted to try changing himself... but this time to match Jesse. It would be fun, being a watermelon girl like Jesse for a while. He edited his profile so that it would take him ten minutes to change before going to hit enter, before he stopped. &quot;Wait... watermelon girls, Jesse sounded male and he still looks male except for... well his things.&quot; Nick muttered as he quickly made a few changes to himself and Jesse that would happen over the ten minutes. He also changed it so that once the change was done, he would be Nicky.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now everything is set.&quot; Nick said as he finally hit enter before leaving for the living room to let the chronovac do it&#39;s thing. When he entered the living room Jesse was playing with her hair. &quot;So Nick, what did you do?&quot; Jesse asked as she looked up at him, Nick getting comfortable in his chair as he smiled at Jesse. &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; Nick said with a smile as Jesse shrugged.<br />
<br />
Nearly a minute in Jesse turned to look back at Nick before blinking. &quot;Nick...&quot; Jesse started as Nick looked up at her smiling. &quot;Yeah  Jesse?&quot; Nick said, smirking as she pointed at his chest, where a pair of B cup lay, and were growing. &quot;You&#39;re growing breasts...&quot; Jesse said as Nick smiled. &quot;You noticed. At least this time you did.&quot; Nick said with a chuckle as Jesse pouted cutely before blinking. &quot;Wait my voice...&quot; she muttered, her voice was softer and more serene. &quot;You changed my voice into a girls?&quot; She asked as Nick smirked. &quot;That&#39;s not all.&quot; He said as he motioned her to look in the window.<br />
<br />
Jesse turned to the window and gasped as she looked at herself. Her face had become more girly, and her shoulders had crashed inward like a girl&#39;s, her arms were shrinking and she slowly turned towards Nick. &quot;Nick... what have you done?&quot; She asked as Nick chuckled, a slight green tint visible on his skin as his breasts inflated to a D cup, his belly starting to budge slightly. &quot;Just made things a little more fitting for us. Have you noticed yet?&quot; Nick asked as Jesse frowned. &quot;Noticed what?&quot; Jesse asked, looking over her own body as Nick tapped his head, his hair slowly changing into vines and leaves. &quot;You&#39;ve been referring to yourself as a girl instead of a guy.&quot; Nick pointed out as Jesse gasped, she hadn&#39;t even noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you changing into?&quot; She asked, confused as Nick&#39;s hair continued it&#39;s change, his skin becoming even more green as his breasts finished inflating at a triple D cup. &quot;A watermelon girl just like you... I even have memories flooding in... and it&#39;s kinda strange.&quot; Nick noted as he started to slim down himself, except her his stomach, which continued to bulge as his shirt was lifted up, revealing the watermelon patterned belly he had. &quot;What did you change your mind too?&quot; Jesse snarked as Nick nodded. &quot;Yep, pretty soon I&#39;ll be referring to myself as a girl as well.&quot; Nick said as his feet became petite, and his belly finished growing into it&#39;s ripening state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just.&quot; Nick started as he slowly pulled his pants off. &quot;One.&quot; He said as he got them off and tugged at his under where turned panties. &quot;Last.&quot; He said as his green dick stood erect, Jesse blushing for a moment as Nick leaned back and sighed, throwing his panties on the floor. &quot;Change.&quot; She said as Jesse watched it happen.<br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s penis started to change, slowly shrinking and bulging at the same time as it started to retreat inside him. It didn&#39;t take long for his dick to become a flower like Jesse&#39;s, but it actually retreated inside her opening that allowed it somewhere to hide. &quot;Much better...&quot; Nicky sighed as she leaned in the sun, adjusting herself so that the maximum amount of sun would hit her body and vines. &quot;Wow Nicky...&quot; Jesse said, catching herself when she said that. &quot;What, Nicky?&quot; Jesse asked as Nicky nodded. &quot;Changed my name too, bit more girly don&#39;t you think?&quot; Nicky said as Jesse chuckled. &quot;Fits.&quot; She said as she looked Nicky over.<br />
<br />
She looked similar to herself, but there was a few differences, like her eye color, size and the pattern of her belly. &quot;You&#39;re smaller then me.&quot; Jesse noted as Nicky sat up slowly. &quot;More adorable as well.&quot; She giggled before standing up. &quot;I actually wanted to test something.&quot; She said as she bent over and picked up her panties before pulling them on, followed by her shorts. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; She said as Jesse huffed. She had been enjoying the sun, and now she had to get up? But she got up and followed Nicky into her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Nicky was already standing at the chronovac, two pages open with timers on them. &quot;What are those going to do?&quot; Jesse asked as Nicky stood aside. &quot;These timers are set for a week. They&#39;re for our awareness options. It means that we aren&#39;t going to be aware that we changed for a week until these go off again.&quot; Nicky said as Jesse stared at her. &quot;And you want us to do that?&quot; Jesse asked as Nicky nodded. &quot;It&#39;ll be fine, besides, it&#39;s a chance to do something fun. We&#39;ll remember what we did afterwards, but for a week it&#39;s just us and the memories of our altered selves.&quot; Nicky said as Jesse rolled her eyes. &quot;A pair of melon girls, literally.&quot; Jesse snarked as Nicky nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine we&#39;ll do it.&quot; Jesse said as Nicky smiled. It&#39;ll take a few minutes for us to lose our awareness, so let&#39;s go outside into the living room.&quot; Nicky said as Jesse walked out into the living room, Nicky hitting the start button as the timers started, the smaller melon girl leaving the room and entering the living room as well. Jesse was once again sitting in the chair with the most sunlight as Nicky sat down as well, enjoying the sunlight as well as Jesse made a comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m already losing it.&quot; She said as Nicky tilted her head. &quot;Why?&quot; She asked as Jesse shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry what?&quot; Jesse asked as Nicky shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She said as Jesse leaned back. &quot;So Nicky, what&#39;s our schedule for the week?&quot; Jesse asked as Nicky started talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we have tomorrow as a free day, so I guess clothes shopping. Then we have school, fun.&quot; Nicky said rolling her eyes, Jesse chuckling as Nicky continued. &quot;After school we could go to the park I guess, soak up some rays and nutrients.&quot; Nicky suggested as Jesse nodded. &quot;I want to go to the beach, get a bikini and what not.&quot; Jesse suggested as Nicky nodded. &quot;We can do that too.&quot; Nicky said as Jesse sighed. &quot;This is going to be a fun week...&quot; She complained, not even remembering the chronovac or her previous self.</p>
