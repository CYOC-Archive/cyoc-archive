<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s Note: I hope you&#39;re enjoying this branch. Feel free to send feedback to s-ox on deviantart. Also I am doing my best to keep this branch incest free. Sticking the protag with a supporting cast of family is difficult, but I for one would like to promise no cousin kissing as long as I&#39;m an author. Or Uncle for that matter. <br />
I would also like to note I do not possess an actual penis, so this is guesswork and Reddit.<br />
Petition CYOC for a Sissy tag &#127872;)<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking for Clown Shoes.&quot; she said getting drawn to the back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geez...&quot; You saw on the wall there was an actual Clown Costume, but that&#39;s not what she was asking for. What would the difference be? Was this just gonna make her feet big? It WAS in the magic section. &quot;You know I actually recommend-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would not believe how hard it is to find specific shoes for a costume. But I have a party to go to that&#39;s specifically Circus and Clown themed. I already had enough mismatched clothes to kind of DIY a clown costume, I really just need the shoes.&quot; She cut you off looking over the shoe section of the costume parts. <br />
<br />
The shoe section was separate from the rest of the accessories. A small wall of cubbies each containing a different type of shoe. Some you could probably find at other stores, stripper heels, tap shoes, ballet pointe shoes, punk boots. But this lady was right, chain costume stores didn&#39;t typically sell specifics like this. You saw talons, paws, hooves a possibly actual glass slipper, all as options. <br />
The customer reached for a pair of bright red clown shoes, very classic. She flipped them over, where the size would have been was a 72 embossed in a circle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um what kind of sizes are these in? Do you have more in the back?&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
You hadn&#39;t actually been to the back yet. There were a couple of sections you hadn&#39;t been in, the back warehouse, and the beaded adult section. But you were pretty sure it was mostly actual non-magic stock in the warehouse. <br />
<br />
However at moment you were trying to discourage her fate. <br />
&quot;Um, nope. We have a pretty limited shoe section. I bet you could probably find something at the thrift store or eBa-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wait, the sign says one size fits all?&quot; she cut you off again, pointing at a little sign above the storage cubbies &quot;I find that kind of hard to believe, that these-&quot; she pulled out a pair of Mary Jane&#39;s, ones that would match your outfit a lot better. &quot;Would fit you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you&#39;d be surprised!&quot; Another voice cut in. It was Jess. She stood looking at you amused near the dressing rooms and strode over. Taking the Mary Jane&#39;s out of the customers hand and handing them to you. &quot;Why don&#39;t you show her how flexible our shoes are John?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at your comfortable sneakers. Then at the little kitten heel Mary Jane&#39;s. They looked like the kind stuck to your original Maid costume. <br />
<br />
&quot;John?&quot; The woman stepped back realizing you had a male name&quot;Oh I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked you up and down. From your tennis shoes to your stockings to your frilly dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;My boss encourages us to wear a different costume every uh... week.&quot; You lied. You sat on the shoe bench, trying to think of how to get out of this one. Looking at the cubbies, kicking off your sneakers &quot;I think those boots would actually fit me better...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, John. How are we going to show the customer how stretchy our shoes are if you try on big boots like that.&quot; Jess smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean she could just try the clown shoes-&quot; You were interrupted by Jess pulling the aptly named kitten heels over your foot. Though you were a lot smaller and more feminine than you had been when you first arrived in this building. You were still at least a head and a half taller than Jess when male. Thusly, you had at least a teenage boy&#39;s sized feet. The shoe that looked like it was maybe meant for a 12 or 14 year old, somehow magically fit. <br />
You sighed, and put the other one on, standing back up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ta dah.&quot; you said unenthusiastically, as your outfit now matched. As suspected as you tried to pop them off, you found it to be sticking. Shooting Jess a look. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah that&#39;s crazy.&quot; the woman plopped the clown shoe on the ground and slipped her foot in, now believing. <br />
<br />
Your heart sank. <br />
<br />
But then she pulled it back out. <br />
Huh? <br />
But your&#39;s... <br />
Jess escorted the lady back to the register while you tried harder to pry the heel off. They fit perfectly. Maybe too perfectly. Like glue to your stocking. You even tried to pull your stocking off but it got stuck on the shoe. Grumbling as you went to the mirror to pull your garter&#39;s straight. <br />
<br />
You hovered near the register while Jess checked the woman out, getting her a shoebox and bag. <br />
&quot;John can you get the register tape down? We&#39;re almost out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slunk behind Jess to reach to the shelf she couldn&#39;t reach. One that honestly you could barely reach, to grab a roll for her and put it on the counter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you look at that! Only $13 dollars, what a steal.&quot; Jess said, beeping the shoes that had no barcode. Still the register showed $13.33 on both the computer and the read out on the customer&#39;s side. The receipt paper ran red as she printed it out. &quot;Oh and we&#39;re giving these out free. Overstock&quot; Jess placed a pair of big red wax lips on the counter, which the woman happily stuck in her bag. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks have a nice day&quot; said the customer leaving the store.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too~!&quot; replied Jess in her best customer voice. <br />
<br />
The door jingled shut and you tapped your foot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok what do the shoes do?&quot; you asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mm Clown stuff I&#39;m guessing.&quot; Jess replied opening the register to reload the thermal paper. <br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean the ones you stuck on me.&quot; You huffed &quot;You know my costume magic stuff is messed up as it is. And no one&#39;s even explained to me how the accessories come off without a zipper.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Turn your shoe over.&quot; <br />
<br />
You flipped it over, where the size was going to be was an embossed 12 in a circle. <br />
<br />
&quot;You got 12 hours, then you can take them off. I just thought they&#39;d match your outfit.&quot; she shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are all the accessories time based?&quot; you asked, feeling your ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Most of them. Some activate if you&#39;re holding or let go. Like the feather duster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um how long did the cat ears say then?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, probably said on the headband.&quot; Jess shrugged, then opened the new receipt tape &quot;Oh, you grabbed the shipping labels. They&#39;re almost identical. The receipt tape is riiight next to it.&quot; <br />
<br />
You rolled your eyes and turned around, reaching for it. Then caught site of your fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; you flinched back, looking. Your hands were suddenly more petite, with shiny french tipped nails. &quot;Ugh I knew these shoes were gonna do something...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting...&quot; Jess said squinting, then got out a notebook and wrote down what she was seeing. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Did you not know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a LOT of magic costumes John. I think Dad knows what most of them do, but I can only find out by experimenting. I was scared they&#39;d turn me into Shirley Temple or dance til my feet fell off or something. So I never tried them on.&quot; <br />
<br />
Something else was bothering you.<br />
&quot;Ok explain why my shoes stuck to me, but that lady could get her foot out of the Clown ones&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s easy. She didn&#39;t put both on. Honestly I wasn&#39;t sure if you were going to put the second one on by yourself. But you did. And it was great. See you can&#39;t even say this is my fault. I only put the first one on you, Cinderella. The second was your decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
You made a grumbling sound that almost sounded like a growl. <br />
Then turned back to grab the receipt tape with your newly manicured hand. Except. <br />
Ok just a second ago you were able to reach it, just barely with tippy toes. <br />
Now?<br />
<br />
You stretched your feet up, and missed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jess...&quot; you accused. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked actually not noticing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I ... can&#39;t ... reach the receipt tape.&quot; you crossed your arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Sure you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean. I could...&quot; you left the implication in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait are you saying they&#39;re making you shorter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I hope not by much! But yeah! I think so!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess made you stand back against the mirrored column and stuck a tiny price tag sticker above your scalp, not counting the ears. <br />
&quot;Ok well now we&#39;ll have it notated. Come stand over here in an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if it goes faster than that...?&quot; your ears flattened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geez it&#39;s not a shrink ray. Relax&quot; Jess said, grabbing the broom to knock down the receipt tape to refill the register.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just use magic for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic activates the thermal paper and ruins it.&quot; she said nonchalantly. <br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure if you believed her. <br />
<br />
You looked at the price sticker left on the mirror, wishing you had an actual ruler around. But not sure you wanted to know how short you were going to get. <br />
<br />
This was the whole point of staying in male form!<br />
<br />
Well... that and your penis. <br />
<br />
Speaking of, you squinted at Jess<br />
&quot;Hey is there a bathroom in the backroom or do I have to go all the way upstairs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah there is actually, but it&#39;s a little cluttered with cleaning supplies so watch out.&quot; She handed you a key on the lanyard &quot;You can keep that by the way. It also locks the dressing rooms but I usually leave them unlocked. And if there&#39;s a kid about to wet his pants, escort him and his mom back there. I don&#39;t want to mop that up.&quot; <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The backroom was exactly what you expected it to be. Unfurnished, barely lit, mostly boxes of inventory, cleaning supplies and dead bugs. You had to shove a pallet of toilet paper out of the way to get to the door, but it was otherwise a functional bathroom. Could maybe be cleaned more often, and had some dead crickets lying around, but it was private. Possibly more private than the upstairs living quarter&#39;s bathroom. <br />
<br />
Not that you needed to rub one out or anything, but you could still feel that plug inside. You&#39;d been throbbing that whole customer interaction. You weren&#39;t like an excessive masturbator or anything, but a whole month of no privacy with family around, you had anticipated was going to be a little rough. Sometimes a guy just wanted private time. <br />
<br />
You lifted your skirt trying to tie it back to pee, what a ridiculous life you were leading...<br />
And unpacked from your lacy underwear. Taking a leak. But... something was off. <br />
Yes sure you were trying to get soft enough to pee comfortably, but that wasn&#39;t it. <br />
<br />
As you were finishing up you looked at your member. <br />
REALLY looking at it.<br />
The light wasn&#39;t the best in here, but you could have sworn your dick was currently at least half the size of your hand. Now... <br />
<br />
Fuck.<br />
&quot;God damnit!&quot; you shouted holding it against your finger to measure. <br />
Where as it had been 3-4 inches before, you were certain. It was under 3. Maybe even... fatter? Like squatter. <br />
<br />
You really needed to find measuring tape or something. <br />
This wasn&#39;t even one you could complain about vocally. Well maybe in a whisper to your Uncle if he asked. <br />
Your face was red from embarrassment and anger as you packed your boy back in and washed your hands. <br />
<br />
When you got back to Jess she wasn&#39;t sure why you were so upset but did ask one thing that confused you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, it&#39;s okay if you did but did you grab those from the back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grab what?&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked over and tugged on something near your ear. You looked in the mirror seeing white ribbons tied in bows at the base of your cat ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; You unknotted one, the silk came undone easily. <br />
You tried to take it out, but pulled scalp. <br />
You leaned in to see closer, tugging more, but it was tugging your skin, as if your hair had turned to ribbon and was currently growing out of your head. You stumbled back, checking yourself over for any other freaky changes. <br />
Your collar! You grabbed for it. Your collar had formed a bow too!<br />
<br />
&quot;Here let me retie that&quot; Jess said, pulling your head down to retie it. You were too stunned to object. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jess. Measure me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah ok. You weren&#39;t back there that long though.&quot; <br />
<br />
She pushed you back against the mirror, and stuck a price sticker up against your scalp again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow 1 inch in under 20 minutes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;1 inch down?&quot; you stepped back horrified, seeing the sticker a little ways down from the last one. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how short you&#39;re gonna get&quot; Jess asked, then cackled. <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t funny..!&quot; you huffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok ok, don&#39;t try to run away again.&quot; Jess rolled her eyes &quot;You&#39;ve only got 12 hours with these. That&#39;s like the shortest an accessory even stays on for. Relax. It&#39;s like 3 now? You&#39;ll probably kick them off in your sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
You let out a sharp breath. Not wanting to admit you were scared. <br />
<br />
And got back to work.</p>
