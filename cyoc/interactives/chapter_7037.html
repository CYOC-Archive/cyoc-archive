<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, it took a little while for me to change,&quot; Brenda recalled.  &quot;I can't remember exactly how long it was, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray smiled.  &quot;I've got an idea, then.&quot;  He got off the bed and walked into his closet.  Brenda could hear him rummaging through something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you looking for?&quot; Brenda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My camcorder,&quot; Ray called over his shoulder.  “I think we should get this on tape.”<br />
<br />
Brenda got off the bed and walked over to help him find the camcorder.  She couldn’t actually get into the closet, though, as he was blocking the entrance and there was too much junk at the front of it.<br />
<br />
He glanced up to see that she was standing behind him.  “Here,” he said, “Take this.”  He handed her a mid-sized tripod.  She gave him a questioning glance, and he said, “Gotta mount it somewhere.”  A minute later her found the camcorder.  “Come on, let’s set it up quick.”<br />
<br />
Brenda opened the tripod and positioned it in front of the edge of Ray’s bed.  Ray set the camera down on the bed and adjusted its height.  Then he attached the camcorder to it, and made sure that it was steady.  He looked through the small LCD screen at the side to make sure that it was lined up properly.  “Here, can you come sit on the bed?” he asked Brenda.  She did, and Ray made sure that he made the shot wide enough for both of them to be seen clearly.  “OK, here we go.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you need a tape?” Brenda asked.<br />
<br />
“Got a blank one in there already,” Ray said as he took a final look at the beautiful woman through the camera.  He stood up straight and looked at her sitting on the bed.  “You’re so beautiful.”<br />
<br />
She blushed.  “You’re just being silly.”  Her face turned serious again.  “Now come on over here before it starts and you miss getting taped,” she said.<br />
<br />
Ray pressed the record button on the camcorder and sat down in front of the camera.  He looked into it and said, “Brenda tells me that I’m going to change into a woman.  So I decided that I should videotape it and preserve it.  Also, because if Brenda’s demeanor tells me anything, it’s that I’ll probably enjoy this change.”  He looked at Brenda and said, “I think I love you.”<br />
<br />
Brenda was stunned by his statement.  But she was stunned in a good way.  She didn’t expect him to say something like that so soon.  “I love you too,” she repeated, and they kissed.  Just as their lips parted, Brenda noticed something happening to his body.  It was starting in his chest.  “Ray, look!”<br />
<br />
He looked down to see that his nipples and areolas were growing in diameter.  “Well it appears,” he cleared his throat, “that I’m going to be growing breasts soon.”  His voice rose in pitch when he said ‘breasts.’  He actually squeaked the word out.  “And my voice is definitely changing.”  By this time it was completely feminine.  “Oh, my God.”<br />
<br />
His gaze, as well as Brenda’s, was fixated on his chest.  His nipples, which had grown considerably, now pushed out from his chest, beginning the formation of his breasts.  “Ooh, this feels nice,” he said.<br />
<br />
“I told you it would as long as you don’t fight it,” Brenda said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, God, it does,” Ray’s higher, sexier voice cooed.  His breasts reached B cup size and showed no signs of slowing down.  His light brown hair started to grow thicker, eventually tumbling down his shoulders as his breasts finished swelling to D cups.  His hair took on the same glorious shine that Brenda’s hair possessed, looking just as full.  His hair remained straight, however.<br />
<br />
The next changes happened in his groin.  He spread his legs out a little bit, wanting the camera to catch the change.  “It appears,” he continued in his documentary like tone, “that my penis will soon be no more.”  He was right.  Already his scrotum had split apart, the testicles shrinking into nothingness.  The rapidly shrinking flaps of skin withdrew to either side of his still erect cock, forming his vaginal opening.  Once that finished altering, his cock began to push into his body.  “Ohhh, this feels…amazing,” he cooed as his eyes closed, the lashes now growing longer.  His cock was sucked back up into his vagina rapidly, rearranging itself into his female pleasure organ.  “Oh,” he shouted in a combination of pleasure and amazement as his eyes opened wide.  “Oh, yessss!” he screamed as he came.<br />
<br />
“No fair, that didn’t happen to me,” Brenda whined jokingly.<br />
<br />
Ray did not hear her, however.  The changes continued.  His hands and fingers decreased in size, the color of his fingernails turning red.  His feet, toes and toenails followed suit, with his toenails turning the same color.  The hair on his body, including his pubic hair, retracted into his skin.  <br />
<br />
“Well, that feels interesting,” he spoke again, not being able to think of anything else.  The camera now saw his arms and legs thinning.  However, they remained slightly muscled just as his arms were now.  It was obvious he was still going to be physically fit.  <br />
<br />
His waist narrowed as his shoulders and stomach crunched smaller.  “Ow,” he said.  “This isn’t too good.”<br />
<br />
“Just relax,” Brenda warned.  “It will be over in a minute.”<br />
<br />
It did end in just a minute, his upper body now showing totally feminine proportions.  His hips now expanded out, causing a look of slight pleasure to wash back over his face.  “This is better,” he said.  His previously linear figure had now been reshaped into a curvy, hourglass figure like that of Brenda.<br />
<br />
The only thing that had not yet changed was his face.  Brenda noticed this.  As he recovered from the changes of his hips, Brenda grabbed his face, kissed him, and said, “Good bye, Ray.”<br />
<br />
Ray knew what she meant, and said, “Good bye Brenda.”<br />
<br />
His face underwent the final stages of his change.  His eyes changed color from brown to a somewhat muted green.  His nose narrowed and his lips grew fuller.  His cheeks and jaw rounded, losing signs of masculinity.  The slight stubble on his chin that had somehow remained when the rest of his body hair vanished, now also retracted into his skin.  It left behind a silky smooth complexion for the whole of his face.  His cheeks twitched slightly, as had happened to the others.  He opened his mouth wide, causing the final alterations to be somewhat blocked.  When his lips met each other again, his face was finished.<br />
<br />
He breathed in heavily for a few minutes, recovering from the incredible changes.  He looked at Brenda and asked, “So what should we call me now?”<br />
<br />
“I already know,” Brenda smiled.  “I hope you like it.  ‘Raysha.’”  <br />
<br />
Ray smiled.  He did like the sound of it.  He was now Raysha.  “Hi, Brenda.  I’m Raysha,” she said.  Then she added, “Your new girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
Brenda smiled wide.  “Hi, Raysha.  Nice to meet you.”  They fell into each other’s arms and made love for the camera.  Both of them had forgotten that it was still on.  Not that they cared.  For as much desire as they felt for each other right now, it would be something hard to explain to anyone else.  The tape that was recording would be as much tangible proof as they could ever give.<br />
<br />
After they finished, Raysha looked up and said, “Oh, shit, we never turned the camera off.”  She moved to the camera and stopped it from recording.<br />
<br />
“So what?” Brenda asked.  “Now the other girls will get a nice treat to watch.”<br />
<br />
“You want them to watch us having sex?” Raysha asked ponderously.  <br />
<br />
“I’ve had sex with two of them,” Brenda said.  Raysha frowned.  That was not something she wanted to hear.  “You don’t need to worry about that,” she added.  “That was before all this with you.  And anyway, they’ll probably want to have sex with you, too.”<br />
<br />
Raysha’s expression brightened.  “You’re right.  That could be fun.  We know that we’re for each other, what would it hurt to have friends like that?”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you feel that way,” Brenda said.  “Because I know I might still need it from one person in particular.”  She was thinking of Tabitha.  She still found it so hard to believe that it was her mother she was talking about, but she could not deny the feelings that she had in that regard.  <br />
<br />
“Who’s that?” Raysha asked.<br />
<br />
“We’ll tell you later,” Brenda quickly replied.  “It’s a little complicated.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” Raysha said.  “So what do we do now?”<br />
<br />
“Get you some clothes and get over to my house,” Brenda said as she got off the bed and put her jeans back on.  “Do you have anything that might fit over your…assets?”<br />
<br />
“I can probably find a pair of sweatpants that will fit over these hips,” Raysha said as she shook them to and fro.  “And I have some big T-shirts.  What about bras?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t have one.  Just gonna have to be that way,” Brenda said.  She buttoned her jeans and put on her socks and shoes.  She walked into the other room and found her shirt lying in a heap.  She picked up the shirt that Ray had worn and walked back into the bedroom.  “Won’t this still fit?” she asked Raysha who was pulling a pair of sweatpants over her bare lower body.  <br />
<br />
“Yea, I guess so,” Raysha said as the pants covered her ass.  “Toss it here.”  Brenda did so and put her own shirt on.  Raysha’s shirt actually ended up leaving her belly button exposed.  “Guess it was a little too small for these,” Raysha lamented while she pointed at her breasts.<br />
<br />
“So what,” Brenda said.  “I think you look sexy.”<br />
<br />
Raysha laughed.  “You’re the only person that finds sweatpants arousing then.”  Brenda laughed with her.  “We need to pick up your car first,” she added.<br />
<br />
“You’re right,” Brenda said, having completely forgotten about her vehicle.  “Make sure you grab that tape.”<br />
<br />
“I need the whole thing actually,” Raysha said, disconnecting it from the tripod.  “Otherwise it won’t play.”<br />
<br />
“Ready to go?” Brenda asked.<br />
<br />
“Let’s,” Raysha replied.  They strolled out of the apartment and went downstairs.  Brenda knew that the real work was about to begin.</p>
