<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">      When you awaken in the infernal palace of your patron Anubis, you couldn’t help but feel true bliss as you yawn in contentment. The bed you were sleeping on top of, was quite possibly the comfiest bed you had ever slept in your life. Although the soft material, a strange shadowy substance, appeared to be intangible upon inspection, it proved to be so incredibly soft and perfect you felt yourself faw asleep within seconds of lying down.  <br />
<br />
   You shake your canine head, blinking your eyes as you struggled to shake the sleepiness from your mind.<br />
<br />
    You get up, resting your back against the shadowy pillow of your bed, to examine your room once more. Situated in the heart of your Lord’s pyramid, the room was fit for a king.  furnished with all sorts of luxurative items, including a large sofa facing a blood scryer, a magical invention that resembled a rectangular black screen against the wall, it’s magical properties allowing you to project live images of nearly any location in mortal realm, so long as the areas werent magically protected.<br />
<br />
    Your room also had a separate sauna and bath connected to it, along with a miniature library containing the latest demonic books, all of which, were dissapointingly mostly either about Blood magic or fictional books that told the tales of mortals that give into their temptations and subject themselves to demons. Figuring yourself as not interested into that type of genre, you ignored the books, mostly playing with the scryer, content to explore the world in the comforts of an infernal realm, before you headed off to sleep for the night.<br />
<br />
  Now, awake, a day later, you knew that today would mark the first day in your quest to prove yourself to your Lord Anubis.<br />
<br />
    Getting up, you gather all of the supplies the skeletal servants had given you, including the large travel bag that carried all of your books on blood magic and supplies.<br />
<br />
  You give one last look at your room, although you had only spent a single night there, you had strangely already gotten incredibly attached to it. You sigh and leave.<br />
<br />
     Immediately upon exiting, you nearly crash into two skeletal servants, this time both appearing different from the usual white skeleton guards you had seen before.<br />
<br />
      These skeletons, instead of white bone, their skeletal bodies where instead made up of a black metallic bone, the shape of their skulls also appearing to have some differences from a regular human, being more pointed and less curved, as well as the strange eldritch sight of a blood red gem embedded into each of their foreheads.<br />
<br />
  The two black skeletons also wore, long gold embroidered white robes, that seemed to float aimlessly, as if suspended in midair.<br />
<br />
  The two skeletons both gave you two simultaneous deep bows, before promptly turning, and walking back into the direction of the throne room.<br />
<br />
  You follow them, seeing as they lead you past the throne room into another room, this one much more ominous, the golden walls being replaced by a dark red material.<br />
<br />
    Multiple strange, indescribable arcane contructs stood at all five corners of a large blood drawn pentagram, strange internal symbols decorating the insides of the shape.<br />
<br />
         The two skeletons separate into each side of the room, one of them at the right, the other at the left. In unison, they look towards you, saying in perfect harmony with a coarse flowing voice<br />
    “Our Lord Anubis is busy dealing with another Demonlord, although he is not here, he wishes you grand fortune in the days ahead. He also promises that if you succeed in your challenge, he will ensure you will be able to spend some private time with his “flesh” that he had seen you take interest towards the other day.” <br />
<br />
  You can feel yourself blush slightly at the implications of their words. You didn’t think he had noticed your slight arousal that much, although it did make sense in a way. You did share a fragment of his soul with him after all, perhaps he could sense every one of your thoughts? Was it wrong for a demon to be attracted to what was essentially his soul-father? Technically it could be considered masturbation in a way, so you figured it wasn’t that bad.<br />
<br />
     You feel your naked body get a large canine erection,making you think if anything, you could use your lust as extra motivation.<br />
<br />
          You nod to the two skeletons, acknowledging their words.<br />
<br />
    “Very well then, You have approximately 364 days, 22 hours, 57 minutes, and 32 seconds to complete your challenge, please step into the center of the pentagram and you will be transported into your starting location, once you arrive, the objectives our Lord has assigned you to will be transferred into your mind.” The skeletons explained, giving no reaction or care at your visible erection.<br />
<br />
  Nodding, you step into the pentagram, making sure your travel bag was properly secured to yourself as almost immediately, in unison, the skeletons began chanting in a strange language, one you could instinctively recognize as the language of demons. <br />
<br />
  From the walls, tendrils of viscous blood began slithering towards the pentagram, fully following into the shape’s pattern. <br />
<br />
  You feel powerful blood magic begin to take place, the pentagram starting to glow in a yellow light whilst the gems on each of the skeleton’s skull’s were also emanating a similar yellow light.<br />
<br />
  You feel a sudden flash of wind hit you full force as you feel a strange sensation within your body, as if your blood itself was starting to boil. You close your eyes as you feel your body seemingly move at an insanely high speed, and then stop.<br />
<br />
  You open your eyes, and find yourself in a wide open sunny grass field. Several clouds overhead casted the land in patches of shadows as you turn around and see seemingly endless amounts of rolling hills and tall grass. To the north, about several miles away  you could see what appeared to be a large town while southwards you could see a vast mountain range loom in the distance.<br />
<br />
   Incredible... you think.<br />
<br />
    So that was blood magic. You were going to learn how to do that and more, and you honestly couldn’t be more excited.<br />
<br />
   No more loneliness, even if your Lord was a demanding and punishing one, he saw a potential and worth in you that even your own family couldn’t see.<br />
<br />
   You were excited, and as you roiled in your happy emotions, you sudddenly felt a downpour of knowledge hit your mind.<br />
<br />
  It takes you only a second to process the information before recognizing and immediately perfectly memorizing the knowledge.<br />
<br />
  It was your list of trials and missions, exactly 50 as Lord Anubis had said.<br />
<br />
       Scrolling through the objectives in your mind you found a variety of tasks you were given.<br />
<br />
     Most of them were simple as your Lord said, only including things like performing your first live blood harvesting ritual, others... not so much, missions that gave you a sense of excitement and dread.<br />
<br />
    Kill an Archangel. Retrieve the Shadow Heart from the depths of the Wokurn jungles. Bind a Greater Blood Demon of any deadly sin to your command. As you read the list in your mind, you couldn’t help but get the feeling that you needed to start moving now. You only had a year to ascend to the level beyond what any human mortal could do. <br />
<br />
     Putting your brain into gear, your first main concern was finding information about your surroundings and setting up atleast a temporary base of operations, looking around you decide to...</p>
