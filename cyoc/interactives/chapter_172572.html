<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>To the person who copy and pastes useless chapter additions: have fun!<br/>
<br/>
I write down the chapter branches and cross out what has actually been continued. Regardless of how many times you spam, I am prepared. <br/>
<br/>
I suggest to others who are dealing with this waste of oxygen to do the same so you can continue your story instead of having it suddenly end. Hopefully we can have the moderators of this app to ban this person if they get reported enough.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’ve thought about it, and I want to be four years old again!”<br />
<br />
“So with how this works, you’ll keep your mental state. It will be like you’re a small person who simply lost their bladder control. Now with your new age you’ll have a caregiver who’s there to change you, bathe you, and feed you. Anything else that you wish to do is something you can do by asking them. By the end of this transformation period, you will return to your normal life. I may warn you, some people do have bladder and bowel changes when they return to normal, so I suggest being prepared for that in a few weeks”<br />
<br />
“Ok I’ll try and remember that! So is there a form of payment for this?”<br />
<br />
“No dear, it’s all free! We Godmothers thrive on our children making wishes. Ever wish they grant is another year on our lifespan!”<br />
<br />
“Wow, that’s great. Anyways I’m grateful for you allowing me to have this vacation!”<br />
<br />
“And I’m grateful for you wishing! Have a nice few weeks!” Jonathan hung up the phone. It was 10 pm for him, so he went ahead and got in bed to sleep. <br />
<br />
In the morning, Jonathan woke up to an unusual feeling. His body felt warm all around except for his hands and crotch. He opened his eyes and saw a completely different room. Everything was made for a toddler. Toys scattered everywhere, a changing table, action figures high on a shelf with a tv below it. His own bed became one with a spaceship design. <br />
<br />
His clothes changed too. It went from a white tee shirt and boxers to a full onesie with astronaut bears. Jonathan touched his crotch and felt something thick that stopped him. “A diaper!” He thought.<br />
<br />
To his right was a nightstand with a lamp and what looked like a camera. It was flashing red and facing towards him.<br />
<br />
Jonathan got out of the bed and started looking around his room. He felt uncomfortable with a wet diaper on, but he was unable to take off his onesie. In the meantime, he was stuck with it on.<br />
<br />
His toys consisted of all different kinds. Blocks, legos, action figures, stuffed animals, toy vehicles, coloring books, and even nerf guns.<br />
<br />
“I knew I heard a little rascal moving around!” A man said as he opened the door. He looked similar to Jonathan, except for a few different traits.<br />
<br />
Before Jonathan transformed, he was the type of guy to wear boxers instead of pants when he’s home alone. His body wasn’t too overweight due to him working out on his upper body. He had a full head of hair along with facial stubble where he usually shaves.<br />
<br />
The man in front of him was different. A man with a receding hairline, unshaded mustache and beard, a beer belly and was completely naked except for the classic white briefs. <br />
<br />
The man scooped Jonathan up and placed him on the changing table. He helped take off his onesie and let it fall to his ankles. Both Jonathan and the man saw how yellow his diaper was.<br />
<br />
“Did my little have a flood? Maybe we don’t need anymore milk before bed now do we?” He removed Jonathan’s diaper and cleaned him up. He searched through a drawer and pulled out two different diapers.<br />
<br />
“Are we going to wear a pull-up or a diaper today?” He asked.<br />
<br />
Jonathan laid on his back remembering that he is four, so he probably didn’t get potty trained fully. <br />
<br />
“Diapee!” Jonathan cheerfully said as he pointed to the diaper. The man chucked and changed him into a diaper. After that, he lifted Jonathan and placed him on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Daddy has something important to do today, so can you promise me to be a good boy today?”<br />
<br />
Jonathan nodded his head and gave his new father a smile. <br />
<br />
His father then gave him some clothes to wear and helped him into it. The jean overalls and white shirt helped Jonathan make sure he felt young again. He remembered the last time he wore overalls was at his grandmother’s house when he would help her in the garden. Just like how it is now, he was wearing a diaper under the overalls.<br />
<br />
After that, Jonathan was left in his room while his father left somewhere. He followed right behind him and managed to go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
In his father’s room, he watched as his father changed from his tightly whities to a pair of white boxer briefs. It was unclear what the important thing was, but Jonathan can tell it was work related based on the button up shirt and pants.<br />
<br />
His father turned around too quick for Jonathan to hide. “You can come in!” He said. Jonathan walked in pretending he didn’t see his father change clothes. He was scoped up and was taken in front of a mirror.<br />
<br />
“Don’t we look like handsome men?” He asked. Jonathan didn’t see himself before, but now he was able to fully see himself.<br />
<br />
In front of him was a man holding a boy who didn’t look old enough to be four years old. “Did the fairy godmother make me too young?” He thought.<br />
<br />
“My little man will start school soon! Do you wanna try potty training?”<br />
<br />
“No! I wanna wear diapers!”<br />
<br />
His father chuckled again, “I see! I guess you don’t need to worry about the potty when you’re going to be homeschooled.”<br />
<br />
His father carried him out the room and placed his son on the couch. Jonathan watched as his father went around and grabbed many things. A diaper bag with what looked like children’s books on the inside. Along with the diaper bag, there was what looked like a satchel being filled with a laptop and many papers.<br />
<br />
The man grabbed the bags and Jonathan and made his way outside. He placed Jonathan in a car seat and started driving.<br />
<br />
He kept driving until he arrived at a building. Just from looking at it Jonathan could tell he was at a-</p>
