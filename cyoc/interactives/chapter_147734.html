<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paula was making a good pace, man or woman he had a good start. Extra padding had to be put into Paul&#39;s shoes and things tightened and tucked in. She did not like her constant feeling of wanting a penis inside her moist folds or the fact that her nipples were stiff and the bandages were chaffing like sandpaper. <br />
<br />
She had an overwhelming urge to go naked. Clothes were so cumbersome and it felt as if her pants were sprayed on glitter. Something that her throbbing pussy didn&#39;t need. Paula stripped again pulling on blue Levi jeans and a crop top. She took off her bandages and looked at her pert breasts. The nipples were full and erect and despite the small breasts that ran in her family she had the body of a model, her lithe body was about 5&#39; 9&quot;. Dark hair streamed down her back in the humid jungle as she examined her breasts in a signalling mirror. <br />
<br />
A, B or C cup she could be accused of being anorexic but her body was a reflection of Paul&#39;s. SEALs were not muscle bound Terminators. Such muscle required protean and sculpting, they called BBs or Body Beautiful, Bullshit for Brains. He had been 35 but the change had taken about 10 years off, Paula now looked to be in her early 20s. Face not so lined by the Afghan heat.<br />
<br />
As she pushed on the training of a SEAL had taught Paula that endurance was in the head as much as the body. She pushed on as if she were facing Hell Week. Still wearing her backpack she realized that the ground she covered would be reduced by her size. Women had a place in the SEALs but size did matter, if you needed to lug what Paula had in her rucksack into the jungle, an man&#39;s aging frame was better. <br />
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Il was bound by it&#39;s morality, if you came with violence you had to be turned into something constructive to be part of rebuilding what you had destroyed. The child soldiers were aged up to make them fertile for replanting the jungle. Claire was an example of someone who just needed their DNA spliced so they could become fertile like the jungle. It was also il&#39;s version of rehabilitation, a warrior turned into a woman with a womb.<br />
<br />
This man had been turned into a woman. But the eyes of il&#39;s spies, all the beasts and bugs of the jungle, told it that the warrior was coming towards them, and it wanted her stopped. Only her friend almost full term and ripe as a fat peach could stop the warrior&#39;s progress. It called Claire, she explained that she had warned Paul about what would happen if that rucksack got near il.<br />
<br />
Claire urged il to turn Paula into a heavily pregnant woman. il refused, the warrior wasn&#39;t any where as violent as he had been. <br />
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Charles hadn&#39;t turned into a pregnant woman over the course of hours but minutes. He had his Ak-47 in his shoulder, gunning down LRA soldier, children, when he felt like he&#39;d been stuck in multiple places. Charlies felt as if he had been sprayed by a AK on full auto, or a battery of needles. But soon the pain dissolved into a general feeling of sickness. Running a temperature hot enough to fry an egg on his head he stripped out of his clothes. <br />
<br />
An LRA sniper would have shot him except they were all feeling the same. He staggered around nude, looking like an African tribesman until his left leg gave way. The bones seemed to shaking violently in the skin, but shrinking, as he went down on one knee then his right leg went the same way. He slammed face first into the dirt. His arms started to shake and shorten as he tried to reach for his rifle. He was left with dwarf like limbs on the torso of a man. Toes and fingers jerking and twitching they to started to shrink down to a smaller size.<br />
<br />
A fellow SEAL had been shot across the ass cheeks with a sniper rifle, now the same thing was happening to Charles but he was laying on his back. His hip bones snap, crackled and popped as they flattened and widened to give birth to another life. His muscles were being squashed, like hot irons turning wrinkled fabric smooth, until his arms were bone and skin, with a woman&#39;s muscle on them. <br />
<br />
He got up from the jungle floor slowly and he noticed how his body was smaller, thankfully he was nude, but the AK-47 that had once looked like a toy in his hands now looked like a broadsword in a baby&#39;s hands. He dropped it to the ground knowing the weapon could take it. His voice had changed to that of a boy or a woman&#39;s...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God...&quot; <br />
<br />
He still had his penis but it looked smaller and his thick body hair was missing. His face softened as the hard lines of a Navy SEAL gave way to a woman&#39;s, the face became oval in shape, the chin less visible, as the eyebrows grew, tucked up and back as his eyelids and lashes grew longer and wider. Charles&#39; jaw softened to that of a woman&#39;s and his lips puffed up to a kissable face with their color darkening. <br />
<br />
Charles ran a hand along his law and his beard came off like dirt of an automobile in a carwash. It didn&#39;t drop off, it was like ash, as if someone had painted his face with it. Now a woman with a flaccid penis he hugged his bare chest against what he knew would happen next. <br />
<br />
&quot;No..GOD NO!&quot; he squealed.<br />
<br />
God didn&#39;t have jurisdiction here. His pecks went from flat to fat, Charles hugged himself so hard it was as if he had a straitjacket on but it wouldn&#39;t be denied. He could feel the soft tissue of his breasts pushing into her forearms and her elbows, pushing her arms away from her chest. Her breasts were as large as her twin sister, a 34D. <br />
<br />
She was well and truly fucked.<br />
<br />
With fatalism he accepted the fact that would occur next, his ass expanded out to that of a woman&#39;s with junk in the trunk. With a wet ripping sound her penis withdrew into her groin to be replaced by an opening that led to a swirling of internal organs. Claire (she couldn&#39;t call himself Charles) hit the ground and vomited up blood and other bits of rejected bio mass that belonged to his old body.<br />
<br />
A shadow loomed over him, a nude Paul. White, powerfully built with a flatop hair cut he had when in the Navy Paul pushed Claire onto the ground and with the pure power of his size pinned her there. Paul smothered her face and breasts in kisses, distracting Claire before entering her so powerfully it was as if they had been lovers for years. Despite the pleasure with her hymen ripped by a bareback cock Claire came instantly, his hips thrust deep into her and as he grunted she gasped. <br />
<br />
Her hands on his waist he thrust into her a second time, his sweaty back making her hands slip up the length of his back where his armpits caught her wrists. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; Claire squealed as she climaxed.<br />
<br />
Paul was finished he seemed control by a power stronger than that of a normal man. He kept roaring like a bull, like the most passionate sports fan. Paul wanted to burst cum inside Claire but he seemed unable to do it. He let out a low groan as he collapsed onto Claire, his once best friend, but nothing happened. He rose above her again, ready for another round as she slapped his face to get some response. <br />
<br />
When Paul came it wasn&#39;t the hot stick baby making stuff, but something cold and thicker than the fudge they put on sundays. However she could feel the sperm, imagining billions of them racing towards her newly created and open womb. She hoped that the eggs weren&#39;t fully formed to accept impregnation but  she knew differently, Paul suddenly vanished. As if it were a wet dream, was he gay? <br />
<br />
Did Paul say that while he wasn&#39;t racist he could never marry or fuck a black woman? Wasn&#39;t he in the States, why turn up here several weeks early nude, with a haircut that was from the 1990s to fuck her newly minted body?<br />
<br />
Claire vomited as she felt something moving deep inside her womb, it wasn&#39;t supposed to be this fast!<br />
<br />
Her stomach bulged, first like she had a big hamburger, she fell to the ground again as the belly swelled, her breasts got into the act going up a cup size as they bloated with milk. Soon her belly was the size of a person smuggling a basketball. Claire&#39;s belly button was still an innie, although under pressure, and without stretch marks a thin line of flesh traced her belly above and below the button. She was at least two-thirds of the way towards giving birth. <br />
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Nude and still six months pregnant Claire went into the cave where il lived:<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul is a warrior who will kill you. I trained and fought with him, his backpack won&#39;t contain medicine or seeds. It will contain something that will hurt you all. We must kill him or take more direct action. You have shown me compassion and life, Paul won&#39;t stop, you can&#39;t make him one of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn me back into a man so that I can stop him or do something else to stop this monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
il considered Claire&#39;s</p>
