<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freddy got to his office on the exact second of being on time. He believed in being prompt and available for the many people who needed him. The practice he worked for may have been understaffed, but the work they did was critical. Helping those who were unfairly persecuted by the criminal justice system was a line of seemingly thankless work, but all of the complaints about low pay and long hours went away in his meetings with grateful clients. Many of them would be sentenced to long jail sentences, often times for crimes they didn’t commit, if it wasn’t for his expertise in litigating in the court room. Every defendant in Sacramento wanted Freddy on their case. If he could, Freddy was glad to represent them.<br />
<br />
Travel had become easier in the years leading up to the year 2040. Personal flight, long seen a pipe dream from The Jetsons, had come true not too long after the events of Freddy’s teenage years. By the end of the 2020’s decade, most Americans had converted to flying cars, that could both conduct air and land travel. it allowed people to travel greater distances in a shorter period of time. It allowed workers to commute hundreds of miles in the span of an hour. It allowed people to spread out further and not congregate so closely in tight knit cities. It changed the game for all of society. <br />
<br />
Freddy couldn’t help but think about this on the flight portion of his trip home from work. Though federal guidelines required full concentration, he couldn’t help but get lost in his thoughts. Though the sky was dark this evening, Freddy felt comfortable enough to sort of be on auto pilot. <br />
<br />
Freddy had thought about what Michael and Evan had told him earlier in the day, that he didn’t spend enough time with them. Admittedly, Freddy knew that this was true. He should have been a more present figure in Evan’s life. He owed Michael more time to show his affection and enjoy their marriage. However, Freddy also felt that his clients needed him too. These were vulnerable people put in a bad situation by a terrible system. If he didn’t stick up for them, who would?<br />
<br />
After 45 minutes in the air, Freddy signaled to air traffic control below in a nearby air field that he wanted permission to land. Getting approval shortly after, Freddy operated the flying car to land, with a noticeable skid on landing. After having his vehicle checked by security, Freddy drove off and made the ten minute commute to his house in the suburbs. <br />
<br />
Sitting alone on the couch in the living room, Michael stared out the window as he got lost in his thoughts. Evan had complained earlier in the evening about Freddy’s lack of appearance, again. Michael had tried to reassure Evan that this would change soon, but he was not confident of this. Michael knew he needed to bring this up to Freddy more privately, so he sent his son off to bed, as he waited for Freddy to come home.<br />
<br />
Michael didn’t know how this conversation was going to go, but he knew it had to be done. Soon after, he could hear a car pull in the driveway and a light slam of a car door. After a turn of the front door knob, Michael could see Freddy entering the house, with a slight five o clock shadow and slightly messy hair. He looked exhausted, even with a smile on his face. Taking his coat off, Freddy turned to Michael.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t have to stay up late for me” he said, while taking off his shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to” Michael replied. “Besides, we have to talk.”<br />
<br />
Freddy paused for a moment, as he turned to face Michael head on.<br />
<br />
“Can it wait?” he asked. “I’m feeling very tired this evening.”<br />
<br />
Michael thought for a moment. Though he had a lot of things he wanted to address, he pondered if it was best to wait until Evan was out of the house. That way, they would have full privacy to discuss things in frank terms. After conjuring up a decision, Michael let out a soft sigh.<br />
<br />
“Fine. It can wait until Evan leaves tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled, as he walked over to the couch Michael was sitting on and hovered over him.<br />
<br />
“Come to bed” he said. “It’s late.”<br />
<br />
Freddy extended his hand, helping Michael stand up from his seated position. The two grown men walked upstairs to their bedroom and shut the door. Though no love making occurred that night, after a nice, hot shower, Freddy hoped a cuddle in bed could put Michael at ease. It produced a smile on Michael’s face, but his worries were far from sated. <br />
<br />
The next day, Freddy got up a little later than usual. He saw Michael sleeping peacefully next to him in the bed they shared, so he thought it best not to disturb him. Getting up, he made his way downstairs into the kitchen to make a pot of coffee. Already sitting at the table was his son, Evan.<br />
<br />
“Morning Evan” Freddy said, as he stretched and yawned. “How was school yesterday?”<br />
<br />
“Fine” Evan replied quietly. <br />
<br />
“Do you want me to pour you some cereal?”<br />
<br />
“No. I already ate.”<br />
<br />
Freddy went over to the counter to start up a pot of coffee. As he did so, he watched his son looking down at the floor, with a sense of sadness in his face. Walking over to him, Freddy placed two hands on his son’s shoulders, which caused Evan to flinch. Pulling his hands back, Freddy walked over to the other side of the table and sat down in the adjacent chair.<br />
<br />
“Look Evan” Freddy said to his son, whose gaze averted his. “I’m sorry I haven’t been around as much as I should. I know we don’t get to spend a lot of time together, so I meant it yesterday when I said we should do something together next weekend. I know you like soccer, so why don’t we go to the park and play a match together. It’ll be some good father/son bonding time and give your dad some alone time that he needs.”<br />
<br />
Evan refused to look up at Freddy, but pondered his proposal. Freddy stared at Evan, hoping for a positive show of acceptance. <br />
<br />
“How will I know you won’t blow me off and you’ll actually take me?” Evan asked, still looking down at his feet. <br />
<br />
“Because I promise you I will.”<br />
<br />
“What if you have some sort of emergency case at work? Won’t they just pull you away?”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked at Evan, knowing that what he asked was a legitimate concern. Criminal trials now extended to Saturdays and Sundays, in the efforts of the government to accommodate working people. This meant that Evan was right. If an emergency case came up, which tended to happen often, he’d have to blow him off or risk getting fired. Wanting to acknowledge this reality, but also try to keep a firm commitment, Freddy responded. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that I will be there for you on Saturday. I promise.”<br />
<br />
“But that doesn’t mean you’ll actually be there.”<br />
<br />
“I’m going to do my best, Evan.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t bother.”<br />
<br />
Evan got up from his chair and made his way out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“You’re never around” Evan said scornfully “and I guess that’s just the way it is. You care more about your shitty clients than you do about me.”<br />
<br />
As Evan ran back upstairs, Freddy slouched in his seat. What Evan had said really hurt him deeply. He was feeling torn between wanting to be a good parent to Evan and also serving those who were less fortunate. He didn’t like how his family and his job were in conflict and forcing him to choose his priorities. He wanted to make both work. Unfortunately, this would not be sustainable. <br />
<br />
Seeing that the coffee was done, Freddy got up and poured a cup to drink. Sitting alone in the kitchen, he drank it slowly before hearing a rustling on the staircase. Evan had a backpack over his shoulders, his blanket in one hand and the keys in another. Freddy turned around to look at him.<br />
<br />
“Where do you think you’re going? Freddy asked. <br />
<br />
“Corey’s sleepover” Evan replied. “Remember?”<br />
<br />
“You said that wasn’t until this afternoon.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I can’t take being here anymore, papa. This house is toxic. I need some time away from you. I’ll be back Sunday night.”<br />
<br />
Evan slammed the front door on his way out. A few seconds later, more footsteps could be heard from the staircase. Michael, hearing the commotion downstairs, was aroused from his slumber. When the front door slammed shut, he quickly got up and ran down to see what had just happened. <br />
<br />
“What was that all about?” Michael asked with concern in his voice, as he turned to look into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Evan ran off to Corey’s house” Freddy replied wistfully. “I tried making plans with him for next Saturday, but he just blew me off.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think he did that. I just think he wants to make sure you’re actually going to be there for him and not blow him off like you almost always do.”<br />
<br />
Michael walked into the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee. When he was done, he sat in the chair Evan had sat in a minute earlier. Drinking from their respective cups, Freddy and Michael stared at each other while they both pondered over who would speak first. After a minute of silence, Michael spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Evan loves you, Freddy. He just wishes you had more time for him, that’s all. He’s going to turn 12 this year. Soon, he’s going to be a teenager and you’re going to wish to have spent more time with him when he still wanted to spend time with you. You really don’t want to let these precious years slip away. If you don’t take advantage of them now, he may not want to spend any time with you as an adult.”<br />
<br />
“I’m aware of this, Michael. I’m not stupid. I just get so caught up in my work, that’s all. The people I serve really need me as an advocate. If I wasn’t around for them, a lot of them would end up in jail with long prison sentences, many for crimes they didn’t commit.”<br />
<br />
“There are other criminal defense attorneys, you know.”<br />
<br />
“They aren’t as good as I am, Michael. That’s why all these people desperately beg the firm to have me represent them. A lot of lawyers may be smarter than me, or richer, or went to better alma maters, but they don’t have my charm or my way of talking to people. I know how to put a jury at ease and have them see things the way I do. That’s a skill you can’t teach and that’s why I feel so attached to my work. If I don’t stand up for these people, who will?”<br />
<br />
“Not all of them deserve to be stood up for.”<br />
<br />
“Everyone deserves a defense.”<br />
<br />
“Some of those people you’ve worked with are total bottom feeders and absolute scum.”<br />
<br />
“Even absolute scum are entitled to a defense.”<br />
<br />
“These people don’t need you, Freddy. Your son does. He needs his other father. I need you, I need my husband.”<br />
<br />
“I’m here, aren’t I? I’m not going into work today. I have all day to spend with you.”<br />
<br />
“How often does this happen, Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“What if I served in the military, Michael? How often do you think you’d see me?”<br />
<br />
“You don’t, though.”<br />
<br />
“Military spouses don’t complain that their husbands don’t spend enough time with them.”<br />
<br />
“Of course they do. They may not vocalize it, but they most certainly think it. And it’s not just husbands in the service, it’s also wives.”<br />
<br />
“True, but my point still stands. I’m here a lot more than others, even though I serve the public.”<br />
<br />
“You serve scum.”<br />
<br />
“Michael.”<br />
<br />
Freddy finished his coffee and got up from the table. He walked over behind Michael and pushed him up from his seat.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go in the living room and cuddle” Freddy said with a coo. “We haven’t done it in a while.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.”<br />
<br />
Michael slowly got up, with a quick glug from his coffee cup, and made his way over to the living room with Freddy. When they sat down, Freddy put his arm around Michael, who took a whiff of Freddy’s armpit and crinkled his nose. <br />
<br />
“You stink” Michael said. <br />
<br />
“Do I?” Freddy asked with a surprised tone. <br />
<br />
Freddy put his nose into his armpit and sniffed it briefly, before putting it back around Michael’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“I don’t smell anything” Freddy continued. <br />
<br />
“You usually don’t have the ability to smell yourself” Michael replied. “You become adjusted to your own scent and can’t tell whether you stink or not.”<br />
<br />
“I guess. Hey listen, Michael, I was thinking about doing something for Evan and I wanted to run it by you first.”<br />
<br />
“What’s that?”<br />
<br />
“I was thinking Evan’s been a bit lonely these days and perhaps needs some companionship. I was thinking about adopting a dog from an animal shelter.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Michael shifted away from Freddy in his seat. Freddy tried to lean into him, but he was rebuffed. <br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, Michael?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think that’s such a good idea.”<br />
<br />
“Why’s that, Michael? When I was a teenager, I had a dog and it helped bring our family together. Josh was just about Evan’s age and he jumped for joy the day we brought home Shadow.”<br />
<br />
“A dog you bred, Freddy. And Josh hasn’t exactly been the best example of a well adjusted adult, now has he?”<br />
<br />
Freddy went stoic for a moment, as Michael wondered whether he was out of turn for saying what he said. Josh was a messy individual, but it may not have been his place to say it. Trying to ease the situation, Michael scooched into Freddy and laid in his lap. <br />
<br />
“I’m just feeling some anxiety about the dog thing, Freddy. I never had one as a kid because my dad was allergic and the last time I dealt with one, it was either you or the dog you bred.”<br />
<br />
“I know, Michael. But that was so long ago. I haven’t turned into a dog in over twenty years now.”<br />
<br />
“Still, Freddy, I’ve been trying to avoid tempting fate. I really don’t think having a dog is a good idea. What if being around one for a long period of time triggers the transformation?”<br />
<br />
“It had nothing to do with that, Michael. You know that. It was the ring. If you recall correctly, it has been safely stashed away, along with the evil wizard, for all this time. The odds of someone getting it and changing me back into a dog are non existent.”<br />
<br />
“Not non existent, Freddy. Improbable, yes, but certainly not impossible.”<br />
<br />
“Do you remember me being a dog?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to ruminate about this right now, Freddy. It makes me anxious.”<br />
<br />
“Although the experience made me nervous and scared, it was kind of fun seeing what life was like on all fours.”<br />
<br />
“It was a horrible experience, Freddy. You had sex with two dogs, almost had sex with a tramp and nearly died. The whole thing traumatized me and it took years of therapy to clear myself of the negative thoughts. I don’t ever want to go through that again.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t want to go through the fight with the wizard or nearly dying again either, but I wouldn’t mind being a dog again for a short period of time. The experience was fun. Not having to have any responsibilities. Roaming around the yard. Playing catch. All the things I could smell and hear that I never could with my human senses. Talking to other dogs. It was an amazing experience.”<br />
<br />
“Not for me, it wasn’t.”<br />
<br />
Freddy pulled Michael up from his lap and sat him next to him, placing his arm around his neck as he did so. <br />
<br />
“I’m not saying it’s ever going to happen again” Freddy said. “But it wouldn’t be so bad if it did.”<br />
<br />
“Please stop talking about this. I don’t want to jinx anything.”<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself. I just get kind of nostalgic about being a kid. No responsibilities besides school. No worrying about bills. No chores. No being a parent. Just being young and having fun. I miss my younger days.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Why not? Didn’t you like being a teenager?”<br />
<br />
“No. I hated it. I hated the insecurities. I hated the bullying by your friends. I hated the experience that nearly killed you. I hated how we drifted apart for a while after high school. I never want to go back to those days and I don’t want to be reminded of them either. I want to move forward and think about today. Today is good.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you hate having to parent all the time?”<br />
<br />
“It’d be helpful if you pitched in more.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you wish we had this place all to ourselves?”<br />
<br />
“I love Evan. Even though he isn’t our flesh and blood, for all intents and purposes, he is. We’ve known him since he was just out of his mother’s womb. He’s our little angel.”<br />
<br />
“Still, Michael, wouldn’t it be nice for it to be just the two of us again?”<br />
<br />
“It will be again, eventually. But for now, we’re…well, at least I’m a happy parent and…”<br />
<br />
“I’m a happy parent, too.”<br />
<br />
“Who is barely there.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not entirely true, Michael. I try to be there as much as I can.”<br />
<br />
“Try harder, Freddy. Time is running out. Either you make it a priority to be in your son’s life now or you’re going to regret it later on.”<br />
<br />
A silence fell over the room, before Michael got up from the couch. <br />
<br />
“And please don’t bring up the dog stuff anymore” Michael continued. “Maybe it’s unlikely we’ll ever have to deal with the curse again, but we never figured out definitively whether you were truly freed of the curse or not. I don’t want to take any chances. Let’s not take any unnecessary risk, please. I need my husband around, not a mangy mutt.”<br />
<br />
Michael walked into the nearest bathroom, while Freddy sulked on the couch. Freddy knew deep down that Michael was right. Although he had a hard time bonding with Evan, he knew he needed to make more of an effort while he still could. He didn’t want to end up being rejected by his only son as an adult. He needed to try to repair their damaged relationship now. He knew that he needed to be there next weekend if he was to keep his promises. Unfortunately, circumstances beyond his control would prevent him from spending time with Evan that weekend.<br />
