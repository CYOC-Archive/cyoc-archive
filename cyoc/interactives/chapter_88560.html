<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In Columbia Falls, George and Molly sat quietly as the news program ended. For them, it was more of a curiosity than it was for any educative purposes. Neither of them had wanted to become Animal People. Molly had been grabbed in Eugene Changes&#39; scheme and George was among several people who were transformed because of the Animatrix Serum&#39;s infectious side effects. He might have very well been the first, but since there weren&#39;t a lot of concrete records, that was a relative unknown. After the first of these news segments with the story on the Red Fox Person couple, George privately wondered if then Leona had only come to Columbia Falls because of the fact that his father was the man ultimately in charge of Leona&#39;s probation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s been an interesting segment,&quot; George commented slowly as he shut off the television, &quot;certainly will change how people view growing up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel kinda  bad for their three little ones,&quot; Molly commented, her mind flashing to Machli and Michael, presently sleeping in their crib, &quot;I mean to have had to have surgery just after being born...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were venomous snakes,&quot; George reminded her, &quot;and while they may have greater mental development than other young ones... remember that animal instincts are there and they were born with a venomous snake&#39;s instincts... just like our cubs have a tigers&#39; instincts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly sighed heavily thought back to Clemens and Jenny&#39;s visit to their own cabin. It had been a nice visit, but Machli and Michael seemed to recognize Clemens&#39; scent as the scent of a potential predator and cried out and squirmed for protection. The sigh was a bit frustrating and George could almost tell that Molly was frustrated and perhaps even saddened by it. Machli and Michael had done rather well with the humans that had held them, but were fearful of Clemens. It was an instinctive response, which George and Molly did recognize, but had originally hoped wouldn&#39;t be an issue. The incident had been a sad reminder on how different things were for them and for the world now that there were Animals that had the same level of sentience and sapience as humanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;The surgery was to make sure no one would get bitten and poisoned,&quot; George finished, &quot;and I&#39;m sure the utmost care was given to make sure that the Johansons wouldn&#39;t lose their babies, just as the doctors in Kalispell did their best to look after Machli and Michael while you were recovering from labor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly only shrugged and nodded. The doctors had been quite helpful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they grow up well,&quot; Molly then commented, &quot;as close to normal as can be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How they grow up will probably be normal for them,&quot; George held Molly to him, &quot;Just how how WE live is now normal for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded and rubbed her muzzle to George&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that&#39;ll help Clemens and Jenny with what they want to do?&quot; Molly wondered, &quot;I mean with regard to her becoming an Animal Person to be with Clemens and them having a family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d assume so, though I can&#39;t tell you what their decision would be,&quot; George replied, &quot;Clemens seems to be a very smart man and his fiance was rather sweet. They&#39;d probably do well even Jenny remains human...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think Joseph told me that Clemens had taken steps to allow them to have a family even if Jenny remains human,&quot; Molly commented.<br />
<br />
Both stood up and stretched, giving a loud yawn as they did so. With that, they began to make their way toward the stairs. They had things cleaned up and George still had his work the next morning, and of course, Machli and Michael would probably be ready for their midnight feeding eventually.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how those three will go through school,&quot; Molly commented as they began going up the stairs, &quot;if their mentality is already more mature than our cubs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most likely the same way any other kid would,&quot; George commented, &quot;Remember mental maturity and physical maturity are two different things... and instinct may help prepare them for knowing what to do for survival and things along those lines... but they&#39;d still need to go to school to learn history, science, math, sports, music, art, and so forth... it might even be bigger for them to also learn social behavior... which we&#39;ll need to prep Machli and Michael for when they get older.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two made their way to the top of the stairs and looked over into their nursery/cubs&#39; bedroom. Machli and Michael were cuddled together under their blanket and were still asleep. To them, it was the cutest thing they could see. They then made their way into their bedroom and began removing their own clothing and tossing the dirty clothing into their laundry hamper.<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t that mean they&#39;d have an adult&#39;s mentality by the time they&#39;d be going to school?&quot; Molly wondered, &quot;I mean their aging won&#39;t be any different from a human&#39;s. Ours isn&#39;t. Michael&#39;s and Machli&#39;s aren&#39;t... so if they have the mentality of children now, wouldn&#39;t they be mentally more like adults by the time they go to school?&quot;<br />
<br />
George shrugged as he sat down on his side of the bed he shared with Molly. He figured they might, but he really didn&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, might make learning things they&#39;ll need to understand human society easier... though it might make them somewhat awkward with human kids who want to play,&quot; George commented, &quot;and that&#39;d be something that would be true for any reptile based Animal person... but I&#39;d think Clemens would probably be better suited to answering those questions if you&#39;re wanting answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I will send an email and ask him,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;Let him know how our cubs are doing. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be happy know they&#39;re doing well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; George replied and nuzzled his muzzle to his wife&#39;s.</p>
