<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dinner had gone surprisingly well, and oven baked pizzas weren&#39;t your first choice, they weren&#39;t bad. It made for interesting &quot;chewing&quot; for you, Luna, Kellie, and Roxie. This mostly came from how your teeth worked in your more wolven form at the present. A normal human&#39;s teeth were largely flat and sat on top of one another, and this would allow people to easily rotate the lower jaw to chew food by grinding it down to mush. However, when your teeth sharpened as your face pushed forward into a lupine muzzle, they had taken on the shapes and arrangement seen in wolves. This meant that at present your molars were sharpened blades designed to cut meat into smaller chunks in an interlocking fashion. This was even more true for your presently long canine teeth at the front of your muzzle. Chewing as you did in human form would risk putting a lower canine into the roof of your mouth or an upper canine through your tongue. Thus you could only &quot;chew&quot; in a straight up and down fashion.<br />
<br />
But it worked and you found that your sense of taste hadn&#39;t changed. Thus you liked the taste of the bread and cheese. It was something that showed how werewolves and MILF-wolves were still &quot;human&quot; in a way, just with some extra abilities. That then also allowed for polite small talk at dinner and Kellie and Roxie also shared their home phone number and the times of the day when they wouldn&#39;t be working if your father and step mother wanted to visit and the four of you wouldn&#39;t be in your transformed state and with a MILF-wolf&#39;s lusts at their peak. That was accepted and made you feel quite good, as it eased a lot of the fears you&#39;d had about your father not responding well to you becoming a MILF-wolf and all the other issues that related to it. As you finished eating, Kellie did stand up first...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mr. Maxwell, thank you for the dinner and the polite conversation,&quot; Kellie said to your dad, &quot;and thank you for accepting your &quot;son&quot; for who she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will always support my family,&quot; your dad answered, &quot;I may not always understand things perfectly... but family is family. That goes for Nick... Nicki. And it will go for her and Luna&#39;s child when she is born.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna smiled at that and squeezed your and in hers. The two of you then got up as it was about time that the four of you were going. Both to get the things that you would be taking to the Vaxer house and to return to other activities that you knew that MILF-wolves were reported to engage in.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s probably best that we get going,&quot; Kellie spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; your father answered, &quot;if someone could help me with the dishes... you can then be on your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help,&quot; Roxie stood beside Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can get your PlayStation and the games,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;you go get your duffel bag and the rest of your things that you&#39;ll be taking.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and then made your way back toward your bedroom where your things were at the moment. As you walked though, you caught the sound of footsteps following you. As you got to the hallway that lead to where your room was and where your father and stepmother&#39;s room down the hallway, you stopped and looked back over your shoulder to see your stepmother, Abigail Druthers had followed you. You gave a modestly warm smile, as while she wasn&#39;t your biological mother, she had made your father happy again and had likely been a moderating force on some of the things that often gave your father reason to be upset or angry. Privately you may have wondered if your stepmother had had a heart to heart with your dad while you were out and that was why he&#39;d been as tolerant as he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; you asked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Abigail answered, &quot;though... I would like a word in private... if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; you nodded and lead your stepmother back into your bedroom with a look of curiosity on your face, lowering one ear as you did so.<br />
<br />
As you both entered the room, you turned back to her and noted a clear look of worry, which only raised your own curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure nothing&#39;s wrong?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At this moment... nothing,&quot; Abigail said slowly, &quot;but I would like to make sure you understand all the risks that are out there.&quot; You watched as she paused for a moment before continuing, &quot;you&#39;re sure you&#39;d want to go and live with the Vaxers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be with Luna, yes,&quot; you answered, &quot;what is all this about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just something I&#39;ve overheard,&quot; Abigail said slowly, &quot;particularly with some that come through my gardening shop...&quot;<br />
<br />
That again made you blink. Abigail ran a relatively decent gardening center shop. She sold flowers and seeds for private buyers who wanted to plant their own gardens and did some work to provide flowers as decorations for shops or other buildings. This included the city&#39;s police force, the schools, and some of the private banks. They&#39;d ultimately have to maintain the gardens on their own, but Abigail often still put those things in place when they contracted her to put in some flowers or something else to make their grounds look nicer. In all of this, you didn&#39;t really expect there to be any riffraff coming through her shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is all this?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know who the &quot;Wolf Hunters&quot; are, Nicki?&quot; Abigail asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some tidbits of them being some sort of anti-werewolf group,&quot; you answered, &quot;basically what they&#39;ve said on the news when you and dad are watching it after school.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was a potential big thing. A lot of it went back into the religious lines of thought that werewolves were bloodthirsty monsters that got their power from Satan. In the Middle Ages, werewolf hunters often got a lot of praise because of the perceived religious problems they posed. Things began to change after the hunt for the Beast of Gévaudan ended, with Jean Chastel&#39;s actions proving that werewolves weren&#39;t mindless. And in rescuing a nobleman, Chastel ultimately gained royal protection for his heroism from those that were surprised by his secret. That lead to progress, particularly as werewolves often found those in power that they could prove their honor to or to groups that were more open about certain things. By the twentieth century, that often meant that countries had made sure that werewolves of all kinds had some form of civil rights.<br />
<br />
But that didn&#39;t change the hatred and fear that some groups had. Many of them didn&#39;t give up on the religious arguments and some were just bitter over things werewolves had that they didn&#39;t. In America this lead to various groups like the KKK and others actively hunting and murdering werewolves for their own reasons. They were often small in number, but potentially frightening and dangerous in their tactics. You remembered reading somethin in high school that they were a big part of why things like the Civil Rights amendments were ratified and why various governments ended up trying to respond with legal force to deal with these sorts of bands of killers. The latest of these groups was known simply as the &quot;Wolf Hunters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if what I heard is true... that means some of them might be coming into town or are already in town,&quot; Abigail answered, &quot;and given that the MILF-wolf strain started here... and with Luna&#39;s mother, she may be the reason they&#39;re here... or are coming here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That they would purposely target MILF-wolves?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More that MILF-wolves are the only ones they can easily identify,&quot; Abigail answered, &quot;remember that since mundane werewolves aren&#39;t as horny as MILF-wolves can be, don&#39;t cause gender changes, and don&#39;t cause a permanent line of lactation, having &quot;werewolf&quot; on an ID card isn&#39;t a requirement. The mutation in the were virus, that led to Kellie becoming the first MILF-wolf changed that. MILF-wolves must have their identities registered and allowed to be public. In this, anyone that knows how to use the internet can get those public records on who MILF-wolves are, and thus our town is an easy target for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You knew of the regulations. It was another thing that was there in the high school science classes that dealt with the were virus, werewolves in general, and MILF-wolves specifically. It was sold as a means to assure people that if they didn&#39;t want to become middle aged female werewolves that there would be some measure of providing for protection. Though, most people didn&#39;t actually use that sort of resource. You hadn&#39;t and you doubted most others in high school had either. You figured that whole rule was more something for parents to feel &quot;safe&quot; about so that their children wouldn&#39;t get exposed. Though, your changes also meant that you would have to abide by those rules.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I take it your concerned that if I leave this house to be with Luna that this gang of thugs would come and kill me?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot; Abigail answered, &quot;and all I have are just rumors that I&#39;ve overheard. But it&#39;s come from policemen as they&#39;ve gone about their rounds, so it&#39;s not as though what they suspect is just random conspiracy theories. And I know your father loves you... and it&#39;d hurt him to have you killed and being unable to protect you himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about Luna and her family?&quot; you asked, &quot;what about the baby she is carrying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Abigail actually sniffled and came forward and hugged you, &quot;I don&#39;t know... I wouldn&#39;t want them hurt, either... but... I don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with my being a MILF-wolf now... I&#39;d likely need to register my identity too,&quot; you told her, &quot;so if the Wolf Hunters are in town... they&#39;ll likely know or learn about me anyway. That could make things dangerous for you and dad, too. For the news reports have said those guys have burned houses and buildings down with the expectation of killing werewolves in the blaze.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That only makes me worry more,&quot; Abigail admitted, &quot;for I know your father would be heartbroken if something happens to you... He may have his grumpy moments, but he is ultimately a good man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Losing Luna would hurt me just as much,&quot; you told her.<br />
<br />
Abigail sighed and nodded, &quot;just promise to be safe. For if some chapter of the Wolf Hunters are here or coming here... there isn&#39;t much anyone could do preemptively unless one is in law enforcement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, and so will the others,&quot; you answered as you picked up the duffel bag and then fireproof box, before a thought came to you, &quot;did you tell your worries to dad, yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;d only first heard of it a day or so ago,&quot; Abigail spoke, &quot;and then... it didn&#39;t seem like that big of a thing... Now, though, I&#39;m afraid that might get him overly worried about you... As he won&#39;t know anymore about what to do about this than I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be wise to at least let him know that you&#39;ve heard about them being in the area,&quot; you told her, &quot;as well as to let dad know that we&#39;ll be careful and won&#39;t do anything that would make it easy for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abigail nodded, &quot;okay... but stay careful.&quot;</p>
