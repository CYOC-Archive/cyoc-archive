<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
A large thick boot steps directly in front of your path.  You look up and see someone dressed in what appears to be a cross between a hazmat suit and a beekeeper outfit.  The figure&#39;s entire body is covered by thick pale grey fabric.  The only part of the costume that is partially uncovered is the face.  Behind the thick clear faceplate you see the grim scowl of a gruff man. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve found them, Doctor.  They are in sector 3G.  But it looks like we are already too late,&quot; says the man gravely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilly, what&#39;s going on?&quot; you ask quietly.<br />
<br />
She grips your hand tightly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;There is no time to explain. C&#39;mon, we have to get out of here.  Now! &quot; says Lilly.<br />
<br />
You turn away from the man and begin to run in the opposite direction with Lilly.  But another figure emerges and blocks your path.  Donning the same outfit, you are surprised to see a woman&#39;s face behind the faceplate.  The woman looks at you and crosses her arms against her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, pooh, &quot; says Lilly, as she lets go of your hand and flies up to eye-level with the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilly, what have you done?&quot; says the woman crossly, like she is scolding a child.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I was just having a little fun.  It gets so lonely here all by myself.  And boring, &quot; says Lilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is nonsense.  Haven&#39;t we given you everything you ever wanted?  A nice home?  Nice clothes?  Don&#39;t we take good care of you?  Remember, you volunteered for this, &quot; says the woman.<br />
<br />
You realize these must be people who work for the Zoo,  The people who are keeping her captive.  Your anger boils over and cancels out all the fear you felt before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey listen you jerk!  She isn&#39;t some kind of pet.  You treat her like a prisoner.  And all the fancy clothes and toys can&#39;t make up for that.  She didn&#39;t want this.  You forced her to stay here after nursing her back to health.  Let this fairy go!  Let her go home to her magical kingdom! She should be with her loyal subjects, among other fairies like herself &quot; you shout angrily.<br />
<br />
The woman looks a little confused.  &quot;Fairy?  Magical kingdom?  Lilly what in the world have you been telling this poor girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look up at Lilly hovering in the sky, and she turns beet red as she avoids your gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean she&#39;s not a fairy princess?&quot; you ask, feeling a little stupid for asking. <br />
<br />
The kind woman dips her head down until her faceplate is close to you. She smiles gently, but sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am afraid not.  Everything she told you is a lie,&quot; says the Doctor. &quot;She is not a fairy. And she certainly doesn&#39;t have any magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But....but ... but... why does she look like that?  And if she can&#39;t do magic, how did she shrink me?&quot; you ask with confusion.<br />
<br />
The Doctor sighs, resting her hands below her face as she lays down on the earth in front of you.  &quot;I suppose there is no reason to hide it any longer.  Lilly is an experiment.  Or to put it more accurately, an experimental test subject.  One of our side projects is to blend human and animal DNA. Our latest experiments involved using insect DNA.  We hoped to create a hybrid creature, part-human and  part-butterfly.  And since Lilly loved butterflies so much she volunteered.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are shocked, but Lilly doesn&#39;t deny it.  It must be true.  &quot;Well, it looks like it worked.  Why keep it a secret?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t a complete success.  We used a retrovirus to rewrite some of Lilly&#39;s DNA.  The virus was supposed to die off after it had finished its purpose, but unfortunately it stayed dormant in her body.  When we found out she was still contagious we had to isolate and contain her in this greenhouse.  Can&#39;t have her accidentally creating a plague and turning the whole world into hybrid butterflies,&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I wouldn&#39;t do that!  It&#39;s cruel to keep me locked up here!&quot; says Lilly angrily.<br />
<br />
The Doctor looks at her sadly.  &quot;I&#39;ll admit it is a little cruel.  But it is better than the alternative.  Some argued to have her killed and her body burned.  But I still think we can devise a cure if we just have more time. And you say you wouldn&#39;t do it on purpose, but look at this poor girl, &quot; she says, as her eyes turn to look at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What about me?&quot; you ask with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think Lilly made you small, dear?  Lilly infected you with the same retrovirus,&quot; says the Doctor sadly, as she slowly rises up and stands.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no it can&#39;t be true, &quot; you say slowly.<br />
<br />
You look down at your tiny hands. The color does seem a little off.  Light blue or maybe a light purple.  You feel your ears.  It might be your imagination but they do feel a little pointy.<br />
<br />
Lilly flies down and hugs you tightly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.  We&#39;ll have a lot of fun together.  Sure, the diet takes a little getting used to.  But you have so much energy and the world looks so different now.  And just wait until you get your wings.  Flying is cool!&quot; says Lilly, as she licks your face with a long thin tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilly! Stop that!&quot; says the Doctor angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  She is already infected.  What difference does it make now?  I am just trying to speed it up,&quot; says Lilly.<br />
<br />
You slap her away and try to wipe the slimy saliva off your cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to help me!  You have to get me away from her,&quot; you plead to the Doctor.<br />
<br />
But she ignores you, placing a gloved hand against her head as she listens to the radio in her helmet.  You can only hear one side of the conversation, but you don&#39;t like what you hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  Yes, sir.  That is true.  Two subjects are better than one.  I understand, sir.  I&#39;ll take care of it right away.  And I promise I will personally ensure there are no more breaches,&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
She makes a twirling gesture with her finger and the male scientist suddenly starts to move to the door.  Two other figures in hazmat gear follow him to the exit.  As the Doctor starts to leave you desperately grab at her boot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  Wait!  You can&#39;t leave me!  You can&#39;t leave me here with her!&quot; you plead.<br />
<br />
The Doctor looks down at you sadly.  &quot;I am sorry but we really have no choice.  I am afraid you are contagious now too.  The best I can do is maybe get you your own home away from Lilly.  And anything else you want. Except for contact with other people, of course. But don&#39;t worry!  I know we are really close to a cure. We should have you back to normal really soon,&quot; says the Doctor as she exits the room.<br />
<br />
You try to follow her but fans begin to blow from behind the exit door.  It is not strong enough to bother the scientists, but the wind gusts are powerful enough to keep Lilly from flying out.<br />
<br />
The fans die down and just before the door closes you hear the Doctor speak one last time.  &quot;I really am sorry.  But you should have obeyed the sign, &quot; she says, as the door closes and seals.  You angrily stare up at the clearly marked sign on the door reading &#39;Employees Only&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not much of a warning.  It should have been more clearly marked,&quot; you shout.<br />
<br />
But the Doctor is already gone and you doubt she could have heard you through the door anyway.  You feel two hands wrap around you as Lilly lands behind you and hugs you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Amber.  It doesn&#39;t hurt.  Well, not that bad anyway.  And we&#39;ll have lots of fun together.  We are going to be the best of friends,&quot; says Lilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the hell away from me, &quot; you say as you slap Lilly&#39;s hand off of you and start to walk away.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Amber, I&#39;m sorry.  I wasn&#39;t trying to hurt you.  I thought you really would like being like me,&quot; says Lilly.<br />
<br />
You continue to walk away, not turning around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  Amber, please don&#39;t be mad at me.  Look, that dress you like.  You can have it.  And you can sleep in my bed if you like.  Anything I have you can take.  Just please don&#39;t be mad, &quot; pleaded Lilly.<br />
<br />
You turn and glare at her.  &quot;Listen, I don&#39;t want anything from you.  Nothing can make up for what you did to me.  Do you think I want a reminder of how you betrayed me?  In fact, I never want to ever see or hear from you again.  Just leave me alone,&quot; you say angrily, as you turn your back to her and continue to walk away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  Amber, I&#39;m sorry.  Please don&#39;t go. Don&#39;t leave me alone again.  I just don&#39;t want  to be alone,&quot; says Lilly, as she begins to softly cry.  <br />
<br />
You continue to hear Lilly softly crying behind you as she continues to mutter &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; over and over between sobs.</p>
