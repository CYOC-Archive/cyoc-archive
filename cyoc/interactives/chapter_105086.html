<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad felt a bit better when he came back out to the pool area after talking with his mother. He had no personal desire for revenge or anything, though he did want to see that his father&#39;s murder face justice for his crimes. The biggest thing that had always sat on his mind was being there for his mother, as many of his best memories included moments with both of his parents. Often they were together, and Tad remembered seeing the look on his mother&#39;s face when she told him that his father had been killed. She had looked broken and weak, which in a way was understandable but also something that Tad wanted to make sure that his mom got over from. In time, he&#39;d thought that Jen did get better in that regard to getting herself together.<br />
<br />
There were apparently some issues that had lead to Dr. Frances Twist recommend that Jen attend some grief counseling sessions over Jeff&#39;s death, but Tad did think his mom had come a long way from the day. However, the fact that his dad&#39;s murderer was caught and would pay for his crimes was a great relief and he was pretty sure things would get better. His mom would fully recover and he could go through life without a need to fear anything. That made him feel quite good, and he gave a small and semi relaxed smile as he made his way back to the pool, which his guests did notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what was that all about?&quot; Amy asked to him as he sat down on the edge of the pool and let his legs sit in the water.<br />
<br />
Jay and Leon also came closer. While they didn&#39;t see Tad the way they figured their sister saw him, he had offered to provide what help and advice he could regarding their first transformation, whenever that happened, and even given them the opportunity to have some fun in his pool to help them get their mind off of the possibility of their first transformation being early. That made them fairly curious about what was going on and hoping everything would be okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was an update regarding my dad&#39;s murder,&quot; Tad spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it hunters?&quot; Jay asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;apparently the crook was someone my mom tutored in High School.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was caught right?&quot; Amy asked taking Tad&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tad gave a small smile, &quot;my mom apparently got a call from someone who reported to her that he was caught and will be going away for the rest of his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither Tad nor Jen knew that Agent Green figured that the prosecution would likely try to level the death penalty against Lionel Ulysses, or that his capture wasn&#39;t with some risks of Moon Lake or at least weres being exposed to humanity, but they both took the capture of Ulysses as an opportunity for justice and good fortune. Tad noticed that his girlfriend and her brothers seemed to agree as they gave him some warm smiles as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is good news,&quot; Amy smiled, a part of her even imagining herself going down the aisle, but it was a bit early for that, &quot;it&#39;ll bring that to a close and we can all move forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Tad nodded, &quot;though not too fast. The moment, I&#39;m more content to have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled and nodded, but neither she nor Tad got much of a chance to do anything as Jay and Leon let loose a barrage with their water guns on both of them. Amy was hit in the back and Tad took a shot in the chest. He wanted to shiver a little bit, as the water was fairly cool, but he didn&#39;t want to look weak in front of Amy and neither did he wish to get Jay or Leon in trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all for fun too!&quot; Jay stated as he fired his water gun at Tad. <br />
<br />
&quot;But no mushy stuff!&quot; Leon added, and then drew back his lips and stuck out his tongue as if to say &quot;bleh&quot; to something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! No kissing!&quot; Jay spoke.<br />
<br />
The two kept up their shots on Tad an Amy as the two gave a small laugh at that. Tad did let himself slide into the water and gave a small look to Amy. Amy only gave a mischievous smile in reply and looked toward her brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, no kissing,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;how about splashes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy then turned and with a wide sweeping arch of her hand sent a wave of water back at Jay and Leon. The two got a great kick out of the splash and bounced backward with laughter. They moved to try and concentrate their fire on Amy leaving themselves open to Tad entering the fray. Spreading his arms out wide, Tad lowered them and soon was in position to launch a pair of small waves and splashes at Amy&#39;s younger brothers as they focused their attention on their sister. These splashes did illicit more laughter and more fun, which was the point of why Tad had suggested going swimming earlier. There were potentially serious consequences from the actions that had caught Lionel Ulysses that could be worrying, but that wasn&#39;t known to Tad and for the moment, even if he did know that, he didn&#39;t care.</p>
