<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank was Paul&#39;s commander and could have been the man they sent to Mars but he felt that there was more power in controlling the first man on Mars. He had a program ready to go to colonize and teraform Mars into a new Earth. People thought that they would be going to Mars for years but he had finally convinced Congress and the private sector to get behind Captain Paul Boone&#39;s mission to land on Mars before the Chinese did.  He had a list of appearances for the new hero of their time. <br />
<br />
He noticed that Paul seemed distant and not as outgoing as he was before. Frank knew that the dangers of sending a man on a two way trip like that were difficult. However they had bet the Chinese by about a month. Paul was at a fundraiser, something to do with war veterans. His only interest was the female of the species. He knew that he had an amazing opportunity to create a new race however he had to be careful. Otherwise the Humans would do to him what the Martians did. <br />
<br />
His senses were heightened to a level that no human could understand, he could smell a woman ovulating from a mile away. Hear whispered conversations across the room like the person had a loud speaker. He was already in great shape but the parasite had gone about making him all muscle. His sperm count was now at least a 100 times that of a normal man to overcome contraceptives like the pill or a condom. The recharge on his balls firing was now 20 seconds instead of 20 minutes and unlike most men he no longer felt the need to fall asleep after cumming. <br />
<br />
The parasite knew that any children Paul fathered would be genetically superior to humans. It could be messy, there would have to be a lot of cross-breeding withing his children to increase the purity of their gene pool. While he had all of these new powers he knew that he was facing some 10 billion people who could destroy him. Even with his new found powers a nuclear bomb, like what they dropped on Japan, would destroy him. He had to be careful. <br />
<br />
Paul had been under quarantine for a long period of time and his fiancee wanted to sleep with him. However he knew that if he impregnated her it would be his end, he would save Erika for later. He needed to select woman who were genetically pure, free of diseases and women he could control. <br />
<br />
Megan was a brown eyed and dark haired girl from upstate New York. She was over 30 and her modelling career was becoming harder as more young and artificial women come up to challenge her for work. She was half black/ half white like Obama, but lighter. She was nearly six foot tall and had legs for miles, honed by running and climbing. Her face, when she was in senior high, led her to win beauty pageants across the country and the world but now she knew she needed something. A scandal or more importantly the first Man on Mars&#39; baby. It was a story as old as time, she had seen this man and knew that he was straight. <br />
<br />
Her friend also worked as a maid at the hotel where the VIP fundraiser was being held. She would be able to get access to the very place where Paul Holmes was going to be! With her hooded eyes and high cheekbones her face looked angular and something from a Greek goddess. However as she had aged the lines were starting to appear around the corner of her eyes as the depression of her life got the better of her. The worst part was that she was now losing jobs to her younger, smaller framed and breasted sister Rachel. <br />
<br />
At the fundraiser Frank was giving the warm up speech talking about American space exploration over the years starting with Kennedy and into the modern era. He was looking for Paul in the crowd and he had noticed that the man of the hour had bailed. <br />
<br />
In a back room a person entering would see pair of black high heels moving in time. The sounds of gasps and moans as two people kissed. Those heels were attached to the shapely legs of Marcy as she moved in time to her kissing of Paul. Her right knee was high, as usual when she was close to fucking, in the air. She sat on Paul Holmes lap like they were a pair of horny teenagers at first base. The lips were locked together as Paul leaned into the long body of the woman he had hooked up with. He had followed her scent to this point and from there she was ready to go. <br />
<br />
Frank had finished his speech, delaying for the benefit of his friend. However the crowd started chanting his name. &quot;Paul! Paul! Paul!&quot;<br />
<br />
He reluctantly broke the embrace. Marcy moaned with disappointment. Coming out of her daze from the alien parasites that were already affecting her brain through Paul&#39;s saliva. She could feel his cock engorged with blood. She felt like she was on a rocket about to head towards Mars herself!<br />
<br />
&quot;Kennedy Suite, upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go...&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at him with her hooded eyes grabbed him by the tie of his uniform and present her braless tits into his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-u-r-r-y.&quot;<br />
<br />
She purred with a husky voice. <br />
<br />
Frank was now looking for Paul but an aide got to them first and see the woman. The aide didn&#39;t care, the guy had spent months by himself going to and from Mars. Obviously he&#39;d be horny.<br />
<br />
Paul gave a speech but he found the inspiration coming from the thing that had attached it to himself in orbit around Mars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something went wrong on Mars. We know that once it was a lush planet that held the promise of life. However bad choices were made and now the plant is a freeze dried desert with nothing to offer us as a species. Earth has avoided a similar fate and provides an opportunity to avoid mistakes that were made on what you call Mars. On Earth we must move carefully and cautiously. However do not mistake our prudence for weakness. When the time comes the human race must be ready for the next step in it&#39;s evolution. We must accept that the destruction of the old civilizations and our predecessors is necessary to ensure that humanity and Earth doesn&#39;t suffer the fate of Mars.&quot;<br />
<br />
The speech was interpreted by many experts and talking heads as meaning many things. That he wanted to fix climate change, that the future was female or non-white or a rejection of religion. What he was saying was this: you are about to go the way of the dinosaurs.</p>
