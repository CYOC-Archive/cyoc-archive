<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Switch to Lucas’ perspective)<br />
<br />
<br />
Lucas quickly realized how horny he was from the experience, it was definitely new, and definitely did something for him. Seeing how much pleasure Jeff got, wow, but it was something more than just that. Lucas toweled off his fat dick, glancing over at Jeff’s surgically constructed pussy. His dick was starting to get hard again. Before this summer he would have never dreamed of doing something like this. He didn’t really understand trans anything really, but he felt like he understood Jeff.<br />
<br />
In his memory, he found out about Jeff’s plans for sexual reassignment surgery months ago. Last April, Jeff called his teammates together after practice. “Guys, I wanted to talk to you about something important. I’ve been thinking about my future and I’ve been talking to people about what I want in life, professionals. My therapist thinks the healthy thing is to tell you, my friends: I am transgender and I plan to have SRS later this year. But, I am not a woman, I feel like a man just like the rest of you. She says I might be non-binary but that’s more of a tool to get what I want, I mean it’s what I need.” They were quiet for a while as everyone absorbed the information. As Lucas was processing it, he couldn’t help but wonder if it was all just an act, or maybe someone was playing a trick on him.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued, “Anyway, I’m telling you guys because you are my best friends and I trust you, I know it will be difficult for some of you. I don’t expect anyone to understand but I want you to know that it doesn’t change who I am, my love for football, my relationship with you guys. But, yeah, I can see where that could be an issue so let me say one more thing.” Jeff paused and looked out into the crowd. Lucas stared back at him wondering what the next part of the speech was going to be. Finally, Jeff looked at the team and said, “When I do have SRS, and this is true no matter what you think, I will still consider myself a man. So I will still play on the field, as a man, with you guys, just without my penis, which won’t really make any difference. At least I won’t have to wear a cup anymore.” Lucas wasn’t sure how they responded but he was pretty sure he heard laughter. Then, Jeff smiled and walked away leaving the team stunned. Lucas shook his head, not knowing how he felt about everything. Later that night when he thought about it, though, there was only one word that came to mind. Weird. After the initial shock wore off, everyone returned to normal and played well together. Even up until a few days before, when Jeff kissed him, leading to him kissing Jeff’s Penis goodbye, he didn’t really get it. He was bi but never thought of cutting off his own dick? Now though he couldn’t stop thinking about it.<br />
<br />
It was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.<br />
<br />
Two weeks later, he sat in a therapy session trying to process what happened. This time, the topic was Gender Identity, he had spoken about Jeff before, but never seriously. It started off with Dr. Moore asking Lucas what his thoughts were about Jeff’s transition. Lucas sat quietly, trying to think of what he wanted to say, “Well, um, it was weird, right? I mean I don’t understand. Like why cut off your dick? Does it hurt? Why would you do that to yourself? I mean if I got boobs I wouldn’t cut them off either.” “Lucas, you came to me wanting to talk about this. Surely it can’t be because you think less of Jeff. Tell me what’s really going on, this is a closed space. There is nothing to lose.” Lucas hesitated and sighed deeply. He took a moment to gather himself and told the therapist, “I don’t really know what’s going on. I know Jeff, I like Jeff, I respect Jeff. When we were messing around the other day, though, I really liked it. But it was more than that somehow, all I can think about when I masturbate is being in his body. It’s almost like I was attracted to being him, not just seeing him. Is that possible? How could that even happen? Is that wrong? Is that crazy? I don’t know.” Lucas took another deep breath. The words were coming out more easily now. “The funny thing is, that after he pulled down his pants, I knew that I didn’t really want to myself, didn’t even want to really look at myself down there. It made me feel uncomfortable. So I thought, ‘why do I feel this way? Maybe it’s just curiosity, just curiosity. So then I started feeling bad, like I was stealing from Jeff or something. But I don’t know, sometimes I fantasize about being the one on that operating table, it’s all so confusing. Sometimes I think about what life would be like and those thoughts scare me. Not because I think less of Jeff, I just don’t want to be a girl. And I don’t want people to think of me as one.” The therapist waited for Lucas to finish speaking. She glanced at her notes and asked him a few more questions, probing deeper into his thoughts and feelings. Lucas answered every question honestly, though the answers didn’t seem to help clear things up. Dr. Moore concluded the session by saying, “We need to try something different, here. This strong attraction to Jeff may be because he’s experienced similar feelings. I want you two to spend some time together, and I want you to really explore what it means to ask for what you seem to be asking for. In the mean time I think I have enough here to send you to a surgeon for a consult. Even if it’s not what you end up wanting, the Doctor will help you understand what Jeff went through, and you might get a new perspective.”<br />
<br />
Lucas agreed to follow through and meet with the doctor the following week. In the mean time, though, he found himself unable to focus on anything else. He kept coming back to the same thing over and over again. What did he really want? Lucas didn’t see Jeff again that week, pushing it back was all that seemed to calm his mind.<br />
<br />
The Surgeon, Dr. Smiths, was very professional. He explained to Lucas that he performs gender reassignment surgeries several times a month and has a great deal of experience with young patients. “I’ve spoken to your therapist, Dr. Moore, she tells me your case is very interesting. She mentioned that you are interested in understanding what SRS entails, feels like, and that your situation is unique. Your desire is a good one, and from what she says, you two have already talked through most if not all of the pros and cons of having such a change. I was actually a psychiatrist before changing specialty to gender confirmation surgery. Speaking to you now leads me to believe you’re ready to make an informed decision about whether or not you wish to proceed. We can discuss surgery options and answer any questions you may have, as well as discuss your feelings surrounding the procedure. Do you have any questions about how the procedure works?” Lucas replied, “Yeah, I guess, how long does it take? Is it painful? Do you use anesthesia? Can someone live their whole life and never have a complication? And uh, how much does it cost?” Dr. Smiths continued to explain the process, how many procedures they performed each year, and what the results were. “As far as the operation itself goes, I should be done in a few hours, at most. Recovery takes approximately three weeks. As for the pain, this varies from person to person. Some patients have minimal discomfort after surgery while others have severe pain for weeks or longer. For your sake, I hope that isn’t the case, but we can discuss what you can expect once you are recovered. As far as complications go, I’ve had only a few minor ones in my career, and these issues are rare. With proper follow-up care, however, most complications can be resolved or at least controlled. Now for the price: the average total cost is roughly $20,000. Most insurance companies do cover some portion of the cost, and lucky for you, you’re insurance covers all of it, with letters from Dr. Moore and myself.” Lucas wasn’t sure what to say, “Um, ok, yeah, thank you. That’s pretty awesome.” The doctor paused for a moment, probably gauging the young man’s reaction. “Would you like to know how exactly the operation is performed? I think that would help put your mind at ease. I can take a look at what we’re working with while I’m at it.” Lucas said yes, definitely. He sat down in a chair across from the Doctor, and felt somewhat nervous. Dr. Smiths gestured to the stirrups at the end of the chair. “If you would remove your pants for me and sit over here.” Lucas stood, took off his pants and underwear, and slid onto the padded stool. He spread his legs and placed his feet on the stirrups, spreading them out as wide as he could comfortably manage.  Dr. Smiths looked him over closely, checking his genitals, hips, and even taking measurements of various parts of his body. It wasn’t invasive or uncomfortable, it just made him feel naked and vulnerable. “First, I’d make an incision down the midline of your scrotum.” The thirty something doctor traced his finger down the man’s ballsack. “In your case we would consider relocation of the testicles, but it’s probably easier to take external testosterone, and less dangerous.” Lucas wasn’t quite sure what to say. His cock grew hard at the touch of Dr. Smith, who was very professional. “Don’t worry. That’s normal for a lot of people. Imagining yourself in the body you were meant to have can be very arousing.” Lucas wasn’t sure if it was that, or the young doctor’s pretty face. He continued his explanations. “Then I’d need to remove the skin of your penis to your groin.” Lucas cringed slightly at the thought. Dr. Smiths reassured him, “This isn’t painful, even if you wanted to only do an epidural you’d feel nothing.” He started moving his fingers back up to Lucas’ crotch. “Your excess urethra will make lubrication for the neovagina, so it’s preserved.” The doctor grasped Lucas’ now very erect member and pulled back his foreskin, tracing around the head of his penis, he said, “Your glans will be fashioned to form the neoclitoris.” The sensation and mental image were almost too much for Lucas. He closed his eyes and swallowed a couple times to prevent himself from cumming. He opened his eyes again when he heard Dr. Smiths’ voice. “Once I remove the foreskin and create a clitoral hood, I will make the labia using what’s left of your scrotum.” Lucas flinched, he knew today would be a turning point for him. He nodded yes and Dr. Smith continued, “Finally, I’ll create the vaginal canal from the skin of your penis and position everything accordingly. The catheter can come out after a few days and in a few weeks you can start exploring.” The younger doctor looked him over one last time before finishing up by looking into Lucas’s eyes. “Are there any other questions before we’re done?” Lucas was now very frustrated, and turned on. It may have been a spur of the moment decision but Lucas didn’t hesitate; he immediately blurted out, “How soon can I make an appointment?” <br />
<br />
“I almost figured as much. Your response has been quite positive today. With Dr. Moores letter, and of course my own you already fulfill the requirements for SRS. Since you’re comfortable being made you’ve already lived as your desired gender for enough time, too.”  This news was shocking, Lucas had known this day would come when the doctor started his examination, but did not expect it quite so soon. “Actually, the reason I’ve been able to have such a lengthy discussion with you is because a patient of mine cancelled for this afternoon. I already have the team and OR booked, if we do an epidural and skip the general anesthesia I could have you take her place.” Lucas hesitated briefly, hoping Dr. Smiths was kidding about wanting him to take someone else’s spot. “Of course, you’ll still need the approval of my colleague, but it should be approved in principle.”<br />
<br />
He came in here just curious and was about to make a very permanent decision.</p>
