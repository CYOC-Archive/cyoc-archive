<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Beware of supernatural bargains....</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; laughed Ryan as the spell on him broke.  He leaned back and stretched and looked down at his semi hard cock, and at Chad&#39;s smooth crotch, &quot;Payback&#39;s a bitch, Chad.&quot;  He reached over and texted his teammates to come over and plow his new pussy boi - Chad.  <br />
<br />
&quot;West High&#39;s QB?&quot; asked one text.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s Prepwood&#39;s revenge!&quot; he texted back.<br />
<br />
His fingers danced on the screen replying to all the texts.<br />
<br />
He looked over at Chad who lay with is broad shoulders back on the side of the spa tub.  Then he looked down at the muscled chest, and thought the guy was a total stud.  He snickered at that thought as he saw the clitoris that Chad now sported instead of a cock and balls.  Damn, he was hard again.  It wasn&#39;t the spell, it was that he had Chad pussified, and he wanted to totally own that bitch boi.  Chad would end up in chains as Ryan&#39;s house boy or pool boy or - well, if his parents would let him.  He frowned.  They were out of town for a week, so what they didn&#39;t know wouldn&#39;t hurt him.  Ryan set down his phone, and moved toward Chad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for round two, Chad?&quot;  he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; said Chad dreamily.<br />
<br />
He was soon wide awake.  Ryan delivered rough sex now that he wasn&#39;t in love with Chad, and he knew the power jock could take it.  Damn, he tried this with a girlfriend once and ended up with a restraining order.  He had to find out how Chad became a pussy boy.  He could make some real money and get revenge on all the athletes that crossed him.  Chad couldn&#39;t perform with girls, and he couldn&#39;t play football again.  His only use was as a fuck toy, at least that was how Ryan saw it. He knew his buds would pay good money to own their own musclebound pussy bois.  He just had to get Chad to talk.<br />
<br />
As he pounded Chad&#39;s pussy, Ryan asked, &quot;So what happened, Chad?  Were you always a big pussy, and that stuff about you being a lady&#39;s man just talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah, uh, no man, I am a stud.  Was a stud?&quot; Chad sounded confused, &quot;Karen Sinclair, I think she&#39;s a witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, she did this to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Ryan, that the pussy boy?  He&#39;s really got a pussy?  Cause I ain&#39;t gay, &quot; said Marco hopping over the gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will have to call Karen Sinclair to thank her,&quot; said Ryan to Chad. Then looking up at Marco he shouted, &quot;Yeah, totally pussified.  I sent you a picture!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but - damn, it&#39;s not photoshopped,&quot;  Marco gasped, as he looked down in the spa as Ryan stepped back from Chad revealing Chad&#39;s hootch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, step right up, or into the Jacuzzi, and take your turn,&quot; said naked Ryan as he exited the hot tub, &quot;I had him- er, her three times already, and I gotta take care of something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, don&#39;t pee in the pool.  I won&#39;t either,&quot; said Marco pulling off his board shorts.<br />
<br />
Ryan smirked as he walked away.  He didn&#39;t have to pee, he already had watching the stream underwater pound Chad&#39;s belly button. He picked up his suit from the deck where it had fallen from Chad&#39;s head.  He went over to the gate and unlocked it.  Then he ducked into the pool house to use his laptop.<br />
<br />
He could hear the other guys arriving. <br />
<br />
He Googled &quot;Karen Sinclair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, the coach&#39;s daughter?  Naughty, naughty,  Chad,&quot;  he laughed.  <br />
<br />
He googled several guys from rival teams and printed out their profiles from the net.  Then he googled information on witches. <br />
<br />
When he was ready, he phoned Coach Sinclair&#39;s house.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, may I speak to Karen Sinclair?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
He waited a couple minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is this?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Karen, we haven&#39;t met personally, but I&#39;ve seen your handiwork, and I am impressed,&quot; Ryan said confidently.<br />
<br />
Karen fingered the crystal she wore around her neck, and frowned.  She was unable to see the caller.  That was unusual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which handiwork?&quot; she asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Witch handiwork indeed,&quot; snickered Ryan.  <br />
<br />
She glanced at the caller ID, and then spoke, &quot;Listen, R. Deacon, I don&#39;t like to play games, so what is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ryan sat straight up.  He looked at the circle of salt he had made around his  chaise lounge.  She shouldn&#39;t have able to scry him.  Wait she said R - not Richard or Ryan, his given names. Most people called him by his middle name.  His father was Richard too, but his middle name was different, so Ryan wasn&#39;t a junior.  It had to be the caller ID on the phone.  The protection circle was working.<br />
<br />
He continued, &quot;Now Karen, I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.  I was just so impressed on what you were able to do with Chad.  I was thinking there are few other dicks who deserve the same treatment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You volunteering, Deacon?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, but I thought maybe I could make it worth your while to pussify a few other arrogant jocks. You know Prepwood is an all male school, so guys with pussies would be very popular.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You little fucker,&quot; growled Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Chad&#39;s the one who climbed over my fence, and begged me to fuck him,&quot; Ryan protested.  He didn&#39;t want to piss off a witch who could turn a guy like Chad into a pussy.  &quot;He told me you did it to him, so I wanted to thank you.  Is that alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank me?  Right?&quot; Karen thought about it.  Chad&#39;s teammates hadn&#39;t thanked her for giving them Chad.  Maybe a few of those dickheads should be like Chad?  It wouldn&#39;t be bad to make a little money out of it? She asked, &quot;So you said, you were saying about some other jocks you&#39;d like to see like Chad?  Why should I do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It could be mutually profitable, Ms. Sinclair.  A hot jock turned into a total cock slut - there are some wealthy guys who would pay a hefty price for that.  At your school for example, your swim team just murdered our swim team, and Kent Fujii&#39;s our swim team captain, and his father is a big wig at Sony, so I know he&#39;d pay good money to have that Bruno guy pussified and at his beck and call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruno?&quot; snickered Karen, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure if Fujiisan invited him over, he&#39;d go for free, but I&#39;m not above making a little money.  How much are we talking about, Deacon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan breathed a sigh of relief.  Though if he could&#39;ve seen the expression on Karen&#39;s face, he might have hung up, and hidden under his bed.  Oh, well, he&#39;ll find out soon enough.  Witches are secretive, and don&#39;t like to share.  And they do know how to entice, remember the witch in Hansel and Gretel?</p>
