<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Thursday morning we woke up to the sound of rain on the roof. Sarah had arranged to take the day off work in lieu of working last Sunday at the show. She said she would spend the day rearranging the cupboard space as she wanted to move more of her clothes into the main bedroom. I knew this meant many of the Rod clothes would be moved elsewhere or discarded, however I didn’t care as I certainly had no attachment to them.<br />
<br />
I arranged to meet Sarah in town during my lunch break so that we could all sign the relevant documents needed to facilitate the change in home ownership. The lawyers offices were only a block from the bank, so I was hopeful we could get everything sorted with the one trip. <br />
<br />
The morning at work passed without incident and as the sun had came out, walked from the council building to the lawyers. I was just arriving when I saw Sarah’s car pull into a space out the front. I greeted her “How was your morning?”<br />
<br />
“I’m pleased with what I achieved. I’ll show you when we get home”<br />
<br />
I took her hand and we walked into the lawyers chambers where I approached the receptionist. “Hello, my name is Rod Burton and I’m here to pick up some documents that Max Thomas was going to prepare”<br />
<br />
“Max is expecting you Mr Burton. He asked me to let him know when you arrived” She picked up a phone and dialed a number “Max, Mr Burton is here …………….Ok” She hung up “Max would like to meet with you if you can spare 5 minutes. Take a seat and he will be here shortly”<br />
<br />
Before we could even sit down, a gentlemen in his late 50’s came down the corridor smiled at me and held out his hand “Rodney, good to see you again, you’re looking well” He gave me a firm handshake. ”And this must be Sarah, lovely to meet you. If you have the time I would like to show you through the documents”<br />
<br />
Once we were seated in his office Max showed us the documents and where we and where the bank needed to sign. “Once that is done return it to be and we can get it lodged at the titles office. One other thing though Rod, now that you are engaged, it is time you looked at updating your will” He produced another document “This is the version we created when you purchased your house, in the event of your death everything was to be left to your mother. I suggest we change it so that Sarah is your principal beneficiary. Think about it. I could draft up a new version and have it ready for you to sign when you return” <br />
<br />
He turned to Sarah “Sarah If you don’t already have one you might consider creating a will yourself. Particularly now you have a wedding coming up and are becoming a property owner. You should contact your family lawyer”<br />
<br />
“Yes Max” I replied “I don’t know why I hadn’t thought of that. Go ahead and draft a new version and when I return I can sign it” With that I collected the house documents and we went down the road to the bank.<br />
<br />
We were able to get all the documents signed and witnessed. The banker took copies and we returned with the originals to Max. He already had a new will prepared and I was able to get it signed and witnessed on the spot. I had a very quick lunch with Sarah at a takeaway, very satisfied  with what we had achieved.<br />
<br />
I kissed Sarah goodbye as she dropped me back at work<br />
………….<br />
When I got home I was greeted by an excited dog and an excited woman. “Come I want to show you what I have done” <br />
<br />
I followed her into the master bedroom. “I have put my clothes on this side” she indicated the left side of the built in Robe “And left you that end” pointing to the right end “I have left most of my dresses and shoes in the guest bedroom cupboard” <br />
<br />
That made sense. If she had put all her clothes in here I would not have been allocated half the wardrobe.<br />
<br />
She continued “But what’s got me excited is in this cupboard” she pointed to the smaller robe on the other side of the ensuite door. It was the cupboard where we had been keeping the medallion. “Look” she opened the door. The shelves were mostly empty but there were about a dozen plastic bags. I could see they had labels on them. <br />
<br />
She pulled out one of the bags and showed it to me it looked like the leopard print dress of Amanda’s was inside. The label said ‘Amanda’. “Each bag contains an item of clothing that we can use with the medallion to turn into what the label say’s” She showed me another bag ‘Zach’ contained the sock that had helped me change back into my true form on Wednesday night.<br />
<br />
I pulled out a 3rd bag. The label said “Curly hair. 24 hours period” in was the bra I had worn briefly the other night when I was in Sarah’s body and she had curled my hair.<br />
<br />
“We can build up a collection of items so that we can change quickly whenever we want. For instance I’m going to save something once I am freshly showered and neatly groomed, that I can use each morning before going to work. No need for a morning shower unless I actually feel like it. I can just use the medallion and I’ll be ready”<br />
<br />
“Better yet, I have a regular cycle. When I know my period is nearly due I can use the medallion to turn into a version of myself from when the period has just finished” She grabbed a fourth bag “This is the bra I wore on Monday. The period had finished then”<br />
<br />
I could follow her logic and started thinking up possibilities myself. “I could created a version of myself once I get a haircut and am freshly shaved.”    <br />
<br />
“Yes and we could make a version of you that has not had sex for a month when you are really randy” I was not sure about that one. I didn’t like the idea of abstaining for a month.<br />
<br />
“Could we use the medallion to avoid your fertile periods so we didn’t have to use a condom?”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm Maybe, I hadn’t thought of that” she looked at me with an evil glint in her eye “We could make a collection of other people we could become. How would you like to have sex with Karen for instance? I would just need to pinch something from her such as a hair clip”<br />
<br />
“And I could be Mitch for a night” I said teasing her<br />
<br />
“Only if you wanted to spend the night outside with Biddy” she laughed<br />
<br />
We were interrupted when my phone started ringing, ‘Mum’ was the name on the screen. I  answered “Hello”<br />
<br />
“Hello Rodney, I thought I had better ring you as I haven’t heard a peep all week” It was Rod’s or should I say my mum Hilda.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Mum, I’ve been a bit distracted. Have you heard the latest new’s? Zach has got engaged. Do you remember Amanda”<br />
<br />
“I remember him with a little blond girl”<br />
<br />
“That would be her” They came back from a weekend in Sydney and she had a ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
“That’s good news. Another wedding to look forward to”<br />
<br />
“Oh had I told you we now have a puppy, Biddy is his name. You will have to come around and meet him”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes I must. Are you home on Sunday?”<br />
<br />
“I think so” I looked at Sarah and asked “Lunch on Sunday?” She nodded “Sarah says that would be fine. Come around at 12 for lunch. Maybe I’ll see if Zach and Amanda can come as well”<br />
<br />
“Ok , I’ll save the conversation until then. Love you Son”<br />
<br />
“Bye Mum, See you on Sunday”<br />
<br />
I put down the phone and said to Sarah. “If the weather is good we could have a barbeque”<br />
