<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Technically there is no nudity... but Morgan is pulled into a wet-tee shirt contest, so she might as well be nude once her shirt is soaked.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan Laurens had learned to adapt to many things in her life, and to some degree she had to, given her tastes and desires. To a great degree, she&#39;d wanted to be on the arm of someone wealthy and where she would be free to all the pleasures she could want and take. Though a lot of that idea was more that it would be something &quot;private.&quot; And when she first started dating Lars Sanford, she figured there was the possibility of that. After all, he&#39;d earned a college reputation as being something of a lady&#39;s man and was getting into a business field that Morgan had read could allow for a rapid rise to wealth. However, Lars proved to be a rather cautious businessman, which meant while he did &quot;well,&quot; it wasn&#39;t as good as Morgan had wanted, and she&#39;d also found that he may have had the &quot;reputation&quot; of a &quot;lady&#39;s man&quot; in college, she didn&#39;t feel he was that good in bed. So, when Philip was born, she divorced and left Philip with Lars in favor of resuming her search for someone that would meet her desires.<br />
<br />
This had meant adapting to being single, working, and so on, but Morgan always managed. Though, to a degree, she&#39;d also never met anyone that would last very long. The men she dated that were good in bed proved to not even have Lars&#39; business sense and thus weren&#39;t going to climb beyond lower middle class, and those that had higher prospects economically seemed to treat her as a passing fling or a &quot;gold-digger.&quot; Then came the surprise in that Philip had hit some lucky break that made a lot of money, became an Animalian, and Lars&#39; conversion wasn&#39;t that far behind, though Morgan had gotten mixed up on who the two of them had hooked up with and initially thinking that Lars was doing what she had technically tried to do with him and then thought he was abusing the one he was dating because of her age. That didn&#39;t work out well, and she then figured out a way to try and gain some access to that wealth through Philip and that ultimately didn&#39;t work out completely well.<br />
<br />
While then trying to figure out what to do next and get even with Lars for doing well, and then gaining the incredibly muscular Fennec Fox body, which even to Morgan turned her on, she&#39;d gotten tricked into signing an agreement that had her working as a servant for Joanne Mabel. Technically it wasn&#39;t that bad, as no one had seemed to go out of their way to make things messy for her and she did technically gain access to money that came from Joanne. But it still required a lot of adaptations, particularly in the fact that the conversion she got was not what she thought it was. She thought she would become a Fennec Fox Animalian, like her ex-husband and son, and could get even that way by exposing Lars&#39; own past college behavior. Instead, she&#39;d become a Desert Cottontail Rabbit Animalian. It made her have to adapt to things again, and while she could, that didn&#39;t mean that she liked a lot of it.<br />
<br />
She liked having the curves of an Animalian female, but that seemed to be fairly generic. All Animalian women seemed to have wide hips, a firm rear, and D to E cup breasts. Sometimes the specific dimensions differed, but that was going to be a given considering that a Horse Animalian was going to be bigger than a Rabbit Animalian in every way. The only ones that Morgan knew of that truly &quot;stood out&quot; were the Bovine Animalians, particularly those bred for milk production, that could be into the F cup range and the Sauropod Dinotopian females that took &quot;big&quot; to a whole new level, looking to be in a range where letters no longer really applied, maybe a J cup at the absolute smallest. In that, Morgan actually preferred being a Rabbit Animalian. She might not get even with Lars as one, but she wouldn&#39;t be too overburdened by an enlarged bust. The bigger thing that Morgan was really adapting to the fact that she was now employed by Joanne and had agreed to Animalia&#39;s system of &quot;punishment and reform&quot; that Animalia had gained a reputation for. It seemed to work with those it&#39;d been used on, but that didn&#39;t mean that Morgan had to like it.<br />
<br />
The first of which had to be part of this wet tee-shirt contest on Heiya Island as part of their &quot;Songkran&quot; festival. She was the only one of Joanne&#39;s staff brought along on this tourist excursion around Easter time, to a place that didn&#39;t celebrate Easter, and now had Joanne and Nicole practically dragging her along toward the signup table. The table was manned by a pair of Animalians, both smiling over the small crowd of female Animalians many wearing bikini bottoms or shorts. Their tops were covered by a white cotton shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really don&#39;t have to do this,&quot; Morgan tried to get out of it, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to speak out of turn...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Joanne spoke, &quot;but that isn&#39;t why you&#39;re being volunteered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan didn&#39;t answer as this began to confirm what she suspected.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d abandoned my mate and his father when it didn&#39;t present a life you wanted,&quot; Joanne answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And from what I&#39;ve heard because you didn&#39;t like the way Lars pleased you,&quot; Nicole added, &quot;and I can&#39;t say on his performance as a Human... but as an Animalian... and particularly as a male with Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome... he&#39;s very good. Which is great when compared to a very loving heart is wonderful. And the heart is more attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in this, I&#39;d say this is a fitting first punishment,&quot; Joanne gave a very knowing smile, &quot;you wanted sexual attraction and satisfaction? This might earn you some fans. And if they want to come to Animalia... or have come here from Lyre/Animalia... I&#39;d have no qualms with romance. A few members of my staff are married to each other or married to someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What I wanted was more private,&quot; Morgan thought to herself, but also knew that she wasn&#39;t going to win this one.<br />
<br />
From there, Joanne then signed up for it with Nicole signing shortly thereafter. For the two female Fennec Fox Animalians, it was more about showing off for Philip and Lars and then returning to their respective hotel rooms for some &quot;fun,&quot; which was likely to be enjoyed and followed. Joanne then stepped aside as Morgan came forward and kept a tight glare on the Rabbit Animalian. While Fennec Foxes weren&#39;t big enough to really prey on Rabbits, there was some of the same sorts of instinctive responses that went on between predator and prey Animalians that Morgan did comply. Though as Morgan signed, one of the judges there manning the signup sheet noted something and spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the contest, ma&#39;am,&quot; the male judge spoke, &quot;though it will probably be a good idea for you to change... we have shorts or bikini bottoms you can wear and a white shirt for the contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge then gestured to a set of plastic bins that were just behind him. Morgan nodded and moved to pick them out. She found that they were all female clothes designed for the obvious participation in a wet tee-shirt contest. She slowly picked up the white shirt and black bikini bottoms that would and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The changing booths are left,&quot; the judge said to her and then pointed to row of tents that were set up running along the beach on the north coast of Heiya Island.<br />
<br />
Morgan signed and went toward them. Getting changed wasn&#39;t hard and Morgan sighed at knowing that she&#39;d have to go braless for this. To a degree, she didn&#39;t mind the body she&#39;d gained as an Animalian, but her points on being desire was more to be enticing but always out of reach. The one that would be with her would only get to see her in private, and this contest was going to be very much the opposite of that. She had no doubt that she&#39;d have &quot;fans&quot; as a result of this. She&#39;d seen enough on the news and Animalia Ambassadoria to note that many Humans seemed to have some interest in gawking at nude or near naked Animalians, regardless of gender. Being assigned to wait tables &quot;on loan&quot; at the Meat Market only added to that. This would mean that several of the people there might take interest in her and be someone that she didn&#39;t want to desire her.<br />
<br />
Once changed she came out to find Joanne and Nicole waiting for her with almost predatory smiles. She didn&#39;t fear being eaten, but she knew they were getting a kick out of her punishment. Lars and Philip weren&#39;t too far behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I&#39;m changed,&quot; Morgan sighed, &quot;what about the clothes I came in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole held up a small paper bag that she&#39;d picked up from the judge&#39;s table, &quot;you can put them in this. Lars or Philip could hold onto until you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I did discuss things with the judges,&quot; Joanne spoke, &quot;they know this is all part of your punishment. So... you&#39;ve got the great luck of going first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joy,&quot; Morgan said slowly and figured that some of this had to have been done before they even arrived.<br />
<br />
She placed her dry clothes in the bag and then passed it to Philip and began to trudge toward a series of larger rocks that overlooked the beach and had a large barrel of water on it. Her march took her past some of the others that were in the contest for their own entertainment or from a desire on their part to win fans. No one said anything, but she did pick up a few utterances from the crowd observing and she heard &quot;Busty Bunny&quot; be said at least twice. She also looked up to see who was assigned to handle using what looked like a huge pitcher of water from the barrel was a massive male Water Buffalo Animalian. He wore grey shorts with a red stripe on the outer side and a red tee shirt with a black bull drawn on its chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could help me,&quot; Morgan offered, &quot;you see... I really DON&#39;T want to get wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Had this Water Buffalo Animalian been Nate, he might have understood what Morgan said. G&#333;ngniú, however, didn&#39;t know English all that well and the restaurant he worked for had worked in a special in that the winner of the contest would get a special deal for lunch or dinner for the next week.<br />
<br />
Gongniu then said in broken Chinese, &quot;Please stand still and face the crowd. And smile. All of this is for good fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now the judges were moving over to an area where they could observe things, overheard Gongniu&#39;s attempt and provided the full translation. That did not make Morgan feel better and noting a few Humans among the crowd and a couple of male Rabbit Animalians, made her feel worse. She didn&#39;t know exactly what kind of Rabbit Animalians they were, but she&#39;d also read that some of the Rabbits uplifted when Animalia began were technically hybrids between either Mountain or Desert Cottontails and escaped Domestic Rabbits and that despite coming from different Genus, this natural interbreeding had been there with viable offspring for years. This then presented a loophole in the inter-species breeding edict, because the hybridization was occurring with the mundane animals and viable offspring were being produced. In this, Morgan might not be able to use the edicts as an escape, as technically, they&#39;d still fall within the stated exceptions to those rules.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And to clean up your act!&quot; Joanne called with Nicole giggling beside her from among the other contestants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Gongniu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I&#39;ll ever be,&quot; Morgan managed with a small smile and nodded. The smile was uneasy, but Morgan also had the sense that she wasn&#39;t going to escape this.<br />
<br />
And shortly thereafter, about a liter of water was tossed onto her chest. And even with her fur, and not all of her winter coat out, yet Morgan could feel it was cold. The coldness got her nipples standing firm and that soon raised a few whistles and calls. She could hear, &quot;Busty Bunny!&quot; get repeated again from among the crowd. She looked down to see the front of the shirt soaked and wet and now clinging to her chest to the point where the color of her fur was seen through the fabric as it also seemed to wrap tightly around her bosom while wet. And with her nipples growing erect because of the coldness of the water, she also found herself giving even more of a show to the crowd and that only made Morgan blush harder with embarrassment as more wolf-whistles came her way and &quot;Busty Bunny!&quot; was repeated yet again. The final insult was that she also got a decent score in the contest, with only a &quot;lack of showmanship&quot; being part of what held her score back. With that, for the moment, Morgan just wanted to vanish and what her employer, her employer&#39;s daughter, her ex, and her son wanted to do really didn&#39;t matter.</p>
