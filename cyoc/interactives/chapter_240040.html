<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were somewhat grossed out by your parents having sex, but as you were supposed to be a clueless baby - and asleep - you couldn&#39;t really be mad at them for wanting sex as parents. Your dad&#39;s attitude of putting his own horniness above your needs made you a bit angry though, and you really didn&#39;t know how to feel about Jenny&#39;s desire to give you a sibling. You heard more creaking noises from the bed, but no sounds at all from your parents. Maybe they were trying not to wake you up now, but you couldn&#39;t help feel that they were just going through the motions there, not really enjoying their intimacy. You wanted them to stop, and you felt a vague discomfort in your body, a craving for attention and soothing. You let out a little whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop.&quot;, you heard Jenny say. &quot;He&#39;s waking up.&quot; The rocking stopped. &quot;Shit, really?&quot; - your Dad&#39;s voice sounded annoyed. &quot;Let&#39;s just finish, I&#39;m close.&quot; he added. You dashed his hopes by starting to cry. It wasn&#39;t just a move to stop them, you felt genuinely bad, tears welling up in your eyes as you wailed loudly. A moment later, you were picked up. Not really seeing who it was in the dark, you recognised Jenny by her scent and the softness of her skin as she lifted you to her shoulder, softly stroking your back as she rocked you gently. &quot;Aw, Jeffy, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; She softly spoke into your ear. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m here. Shhhhh. Mummy&#39;s here.&quot;.<br />
Your baby body responded to her soothing presence and you calmed down, sobs turning into sniffles as she tried to figure out the source of your distress. &quot;Are you poopy, baby? Have you made poopoo?&quot; she sniffed the air near your back and felt your nappy with her hand. &quot;Nah, all clean. Clean and snug, huh?&quot; she cooed. You pressed your face onto her shoulder, rubbing your tears onto her skin, and she gently stroked the back of your head with her fingers. &quot;So what&#39;s the matter? Does your tummy hurt? Did you have a bad dream?&quot; she asked, not expecting an answer. You snuggled up to her, fine with being held for the moment.<br />
&quot;Get back to bed, babe!&quot; your Dad said. &quot;Just a minute, I think he&#39;s falling asleep.&quot; Jenny replied, and you thought you heard a slight insecurity in her words. Her grip around you became a little tighter. You felt tired as you probably hadn&#39;t slept for long, but you were pretty sure you weren&#39;t falling asleep this fast. Dad would have to wait.<br />
Jenny was softly humming the melody of &quot;Hush, little baby&quot; into your ear, and although you appreciated the effort it didn&#39;t make you any sleepier. When Jenny slowly and carefully shifted you onto her arm and gently tried to put you back in your crib, you wailed loudly before you even touched the mattress.<br />
She cradled you next to her chest with a big sigh. &quot;Aw, Jeffy!&quot; she cooed. &quot;Mummy&#39;s all tired, let&#39;s just get back to sleep.&quot; she said, and you suspected a blatant lie. The source of the vague discomfort you&#39;d been feeling became clearer - a dull, throbbing pain in your lower jaw. You felt the place with your tongue, and there was a warm swelling in your gum. Apparently, you were teething. You squirmed and mewled softly in her arms, and the smell of milk from the nipple next to your face caught your attention. You quickly grabbed the nipple in your mouth and squeezed, the shallow latch eliciting a wince of pain from your surprised Mommy. &quot;No, Jeffy, let&#39;s do this properly&quot; she said and made you let go with her finger, making you whine in protest.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; your Dad asked from the bed.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe he&#39;s hungry again or just doesn&#39;t feel too good. I guess I gotta nurse him back to sleep.&quot; Jenny said and yawned. Maybe she really was tired. You felt her get back into bed, lying down on her side, with you next to her between your parents.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; your Dad said behind you as you began to nurse. &quot;When do you think he should learn to live without your tits?! Do you wanna breastfeed him in elementary school? &#39;Mummy, my teacher&#39;s mean, I need booby milk!&#39; Do you really wanna raise a kid like that? I sure don&#39;t! Isa never breastfed Lily at all, and she turned out all right!&quot; He said angrily, his voice growing louder. You suckled more intensely. Without the safety of Jenny&#39;s arm around you and the comfort of her milk and her warmth, his outburst would certainly have made you cry. Your Dad using your original mom and younger sister - the family he had apparently dumped in this reality - as arguments against you enjoying your mother&#39;s milk made you angry. &#39;Has Dad always been such an asshole?&#39; you thought, wondering if the Chronivac had somehow made him a worse person.<br />
&quot;Robbie, please! He&#39;s just half a year old, and it&#39;s good for him.&quot; she said softly, defensively. &quot;And don&#39;t you love my full milk jugs too?&quot; she added, sounding way too eager to please him for your taste. &quot;I&#39;d love if we could just fuck like we used to! Really, Jenny, I miss the old, carefree, hot and horny you.&quot; your Dad replied, at normal speaking volume now. The bed squeaked and you felt the vibration as he got up.<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Jenny asked, pain and maybe even fear in her voice.<br />
&quot;To the bathroom. I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s appropriate to blow my load next to a mom feeding her baby - I don&#39;t wanna sexualize you like that.&quot; he said and left the room<br />
You heard Jenny whimpering and felt her ragged breath, trying to hold back tears for your sake. &#39;Wanker!&#39; you thought, quite literally. For a moment you wished your Dad would painfully stub his toe in the dark or something. Then, your mind wandered to the Chronivac. Why was Jenny putting up with this if she had the power to change the situation? Was it what she actually wanted? Did she even remember the option to change reality, or had she somehow become unaware of the changes?  You realized she&#39;d been treating you just like a normal baby since just after the transformation, as if she didn&#39;t remember you having been a teen and still having your teenage mind in your baby body. Over the next minutes, the racing thoughts in your head and the pain from your soon-to-emerge first teeth were sucked away in a vortex of Mummy&#39;s milk, and you fell asleep next to her content and saturated, the other side of the bed behind you still empty.</p>
