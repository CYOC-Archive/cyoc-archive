<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was by the time lunch break came around, that Kyle began noticing a pattern in Jen&#39;s behaviour.<br />
<br />
The two teens were a year apart, meaning that their class hours did not always align, but whenever Kyle made notice of Jen walking around together with her little posse of cheerleader friends, he would watch them from a distance. One perk of being the one to curse Jen was that he could see exactly how the older teenager&#39;s curse came into effect.<br />
<br />
But it occurred to him that Jen was still very much attached to only a single pair of legs... most of the time. He assumed they were Latoia&#39;s, one of Jen&#39;s girl friends. Jen&#39;s new legs were long and slender, and most importantly, they were black, so they stood out a lot underneath her much paler torso. Kyle guessed that his tormentor had become at least a head taller than she used to be with these legs. The skirt she was wearing only barely managed to cover her curvy hips and ass.<br />
<br />
Kyle noticed when Jen spoke another lie, for anytime she did, her new ebony legs would reappear below the torso of one of her friends, the person she so shamelessly lied to. However, Jen would notice herself as well, and with yet another dishonest comments, she would have Latoia&#39;s legs back again. It was definitely a pattern that the boy so attentively noticed.<br />
<br />
It served as a new source of frustration for Kyle. Clearly the vile girl hadn&#39;t learned her lesson, and was now trying to exploit the curse that was meant to humiliate her. Looking at Latoia... whose fat and wrinkly legs were those?!<br />
<br />
The sophomore boy couldn&#39;t believe it. Jen had to be feigning confidence for her to try to work around the town&#39;s curse so easily. There was even a good chance that she already lost her original pair of legs to some random passer-by on her way to school. Perhaps she decided to settle for a lower body befitting a teen model as the only remaining solution instead. Either way, the nerdy, awkward boy was curious. He decided that he was going to confront her the moment there was nobody else around anymore.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s opportunity came sooner, rather than later.<br />
<br />
Through the window by his classroom&#39;s door, he saw Jennifer walking past, alone. With basically the entire student body stuck in class, he grabbed his chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Allen.&quot; He called out to his English teacher, raising his hand. She turned around from the whiteboard to look at him. &quot;Yes, Kyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I go to the toilet?&quot; He asked carefully, trying not to let his eagerness show.<br />
<br />
It was only helpful that he had built a positive relationship with Ms. Allen with his unending curiousity and his clean record when it came to finishing homework assignments, even if he garnered a reputation among his classmates as the teacher&#39;s pet. The middle-aged woman gave him a smile where normally, any other student would get told off and asked why they didn&#39;t go before the class started. Kyle&#39;s English teacher excused him, and he quickly paced out of the classroom, hurrying in the direction Jennifer had walked off to.<br />
<br />
He only just managed to catch a glimpse of the junior girl as she walked her long, curvy black legs into the storage room where the school kept all the study materials.<br />
<br />
Kyle entered the room as well, shutting the door behind him, then locking it from the inside with a twist of his wrist, so that nobody from outside could enter that easily.<br />
<br />
Jennifer jolted up from behind a bookshelf, holding up a history book in her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teach, I&#39;m sorry! I needed a book only for this period-&quot;<br />
<br />
Her wide-eyed expression turned into a glare when she finally noticed who she was talking to. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you.&quot;<br />
<br />
A grin formed on Kyle&#39;s face as he saw the anger on Jen&#39;s face. &quot;Hi Jenny,&quot; he spoke faux-amicably. &quot;Are you happy with the outcome? I noticed that you simply couldn&#39;t stop yourself from lying today, despite the curse I gave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re an asshole Kyle. thanks to you, my friend Latoia is walking around school with what is basically a hernia. I wouldn&#39;t wish that on anybody, and yet you&#39;re laughing about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle clacked his tongue. &quot;Even now you&#39;re being dishonest with yourself. Had you not been such a shitty bully in the first place, this would never have happened to you or your friends. Besides, Latoia was standing around and laughing as well when you pantsed me last week, don&#39;t believe for a second that I have forgotten that.<br />
<br />
Matter of fact. I believe you still haven&#39;t learned your lesson, even now. I&#39;ve seen you walk around with Latoia&#39;s legs the entire afternoon, and I don&#39;t believe for a second that you simply stopped lying since the start of school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you&#39;ve been side-eyeing me and my friends you creep!&quot; Jennifer hissed. &quot;Even my friends were talking about it during lunch break. Ashley mentioned that it seemed as if you were trying to get into my pants. And locking the two of us in this storage room won&#39;t exactly favour your side of the story either. Imagine what the security guard must think when he sees a hotshot and a weird, lonely nerd together in a confined space!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle startled, suddenly worried. Then, before he knew it, Jennifer, who was now literally a head taller than him, stood right in front of him, looking down on him. There was a glint of something in her eyes, but the shorter boy couldn&#39;t place it. <br />
<br />
Her movements had grown slower, and Kyle suddenly become all too aware of the Jen&#39;s heavy breathing in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... you know, there is always that teeny tiny chance,&quot; the cheerleader said with a sultry voice, &quot;that one of the hottest girls in school takes an interest in you, and your reckless actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Plastered to the wall, Kyle could only gulp. Jen bent over, and when Kyle looked down, he saw to his horror, and excitement, that the girl teen was reaching underneath the yellow skirt she was wearing. Like a movie star, Jen moved her thumbs between the elastic band of her panties, which she then proceeded to slide down her legs. She held the offending piece of fabric in front of his face between her fingers. A musky, arousing smell emanated off it. <br />
<br />
Kyle felt himself melt, as Jennifer leaned forward to whisper sweet words in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really, really want to have sex with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, the hot cheerleader girl straightened up again, and Kyle looked down to see that Jen wore an evil grin on her face, just like the one he had worn when he entered the storage room.<br />
<br />
She held up the panties in her fist one last time. &quot;Try not to get caught, loser!&quot; Spat Jen, before she unlocked the door and stormed out, history book underneath her arm, and the panties tucked away inside the pocket of her new boy jeans.<br />
<br />
Confused, Kyle looked after her. When she finally disappeared from view, he let out a breath he&#39;d been holding. His sigh came with a full-body shiver and goosebumps, and he felt like he had gotten out of a dire situation, where Jen had set him up in. <br />
<br />
Then, he looked down at himself. Finally, he screamed, when he saw that he now wore a yellow skirt, reaching down no further than his knees, an attractive pair of long, dark-brown legs sticking out from under him.</p>
