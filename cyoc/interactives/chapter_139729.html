<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided to be a statue, and he wants to be the most famous one: David by Michelangelo.<br />
<br />
Duration: 48 Hours<br />
Awareness: On<br />
Length of Tranformation: 15min<br />
Location: Galleria dell&#39;Accademia, Italy<br />
Sensitvity: 80%<br />
<br />
As Jeff hit enter, he suddenly finds himself in the Galleria dell&#39;Accademia at 3AM. He looks around and the hallways eeriely empty. he is in a room with a giant dome miles above him and 4 giant arches on each one of the walls. The first and second arches lead down long hallways to other artworks. The third one was a mini gallery with many famous paintings. And finally the last one had an empty marble pedestal, where David was supposed to be. Then out of thin air, a slab shaped rock and a tree stump appeared on the pedestal.<br />
<br />
He felt compelled to get on the pedestal, so he climbed up on it. For some reason there was a mirror propped up on the walls, and he assumed the chronviac put it there so he could watch his tranformation. The slab of rock felt cold on the soles of his feet, but not for long as he felt the soles of feet thicken as if he had been walking barefoot his entire life. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s shirt slowly thinned out into a sling and his pants and underwear fused and crumpled into a rock. He put the rock into the sling and draped it over his left shoulder, the as it diagonally crosses his back, he holds the rock in his right hand. Jeff&#39;s feet and legs suddenly moved on their own, and when Jeff looked into the mirror, his bottom half was doing the pose of David with the right leg inside the stump and the toes on his left foot hung of the edge of the slap rock.<br />
<br />
He suddenly felt his lower half swell with muscle, and even his feet were muscular! the stump now perfectly hugged his right calf, just like on the statue. Jeff noticed the stone he was standing on had become the color of the pedestal, and was spreading into his feet. He felt his feet fuse into the rock and his calf fused with the discolored wood. Jeff bent down to touch his feet and they were rock hard and smooth.<br />
<br />
The change reached his balls, and a small, curly, elegant patch of pubic hair grew above his member, but it was oddly flat, sticking to his skin. Jeff&#39;s ballsacks were shrinking in the cold air of the museum, but that was going to change. Jeff watched as his ballsacks started to expand and dangle, but as the white color of the Carrara marble spread, they turned solid and stopped swinging. Jeff&#39;s shaft was in a raging erection as it got smaller, but he expected it because the ancient Greeks saw small members as smart and intelligent and big ones as stupid and lustful, and to add on to it the statue is of David before his fight with the Goliath so his dick is also shrinking in fear. Jeff watched as his dick went flaccid, then rock hard without sticking up.<br />
<br />
The marble stopped at his waist, as if waiting for something. He wondered what it could be, and Jeff&#39;s answer came when his muscles on his arms swelled and a 6 pack rose out of his stomach. His pecs extended a bit at widened as his hands, neck, and shoulders bulged with muscle. Now the wave of marble continued advancing until his neck was also marble, and it paused again.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his face tingling, and in the mirror he saw his hair become curly, and his mouth and nose shrunk until it looked like a cute, handsome face. Jeffs eyebrows got bushier, and surprisingly his pupils moved on their own until he was looking at his left side of him, where the mini gallery was. Jeff couldn&#39;t control his muscles and the moved into the rest of David&#39;s pose, with his left arm coming up to his shoulder until his left hand was equal in height of his shoulder, and the had clenched on the top of the sling. Meanwhile his right arm moved next to his right thigh and was holding the rock in the sling, which was draped across his back.<br />
<br />
With that, the marble continued its march. As it creeped up into his mouth and nostrils, he felt a cold feeling inside himself as his organs, bones, and tissues all turned into solid marble and filled his entire body. He no longer could make sounds, breath, and have his heart beat. When the marble crept over his eyes, there was a brief moment of blurriness as his eyes became stone. His hair became solid marble as well, fusing with the top half of his ears. <br />
<br />
Now that Jeff was a complete replica of David, he waited for the museum to open. As usual he was the most popular exhibit, and when a kid snuck under the barriers and touched him, he was lost in pleasure. There were so many camera flashes, and he wanted to close his stone eyes.</p>
