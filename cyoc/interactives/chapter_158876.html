<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec was left momentarily speechless as he looked into the mirror at the end of the entry hallway to the locker room. The building had a small hallway leading into the locker room, and at the end of it was a mirror, and thus Alec was left looking at what had become of him. He slowly started to grin. He only saw the muscles coming in, forming tight knots of vascular strength that nicely corded his finely muscled ass and legs. He saw his tight calves and flexed his bulging biceps, licking one of them and tasting salty sweat upon his skin - at once reminding him of why he was even there to begin with.<br />
<br />
He proceeded inside, and Alec pointedly ignored the more troubling bits of his changes. He just told himself it was from the sweat he&#39;d made fucking his teacher. Not that that could well and truly explain his slightly more tanned countenance, though it did explain in his mind why his hair was slightly more curly at the tips, stained more dark brown toward the edges and frays. He was enchanted though with what he saw when he stripped down and fetched a towel from his locker.<br />
<br />
Alec saw his hefty manhood, swinging between his finely honed legs, and noted it did seem to be of more pornographic scale as opposed to what he was used to. He didn&#39;t care for the rather caramel hued look to his masculine organ, but a single rub from tip to base made him quiver with pleasure even so soon after sex. Alec was happy there were no other people in and around here for now. Otherwise, they&#39;d see this stud vainly appreciating himself, enjoying every taper and aesthetic edge to his physique.<br />
<br />
This body that he had seemed to come out of nowhere, but he told himself it came down purely to the hard work and dedication he showed to his school sport of being a wrestler. Surely this was the build and body of a primed young wrestler. He told himself that surely this would benefit him in the sport.<br />
<br />
Few other members of the sport in his school excepting Danny, so nicknamed &quot;Muscles&quot;, had a body like this. On some level, Alec was looking forward to wrestling Danny. Feeling their bodies compete against one another in a sport as old as Ancient Greece. And only one of them could end it the victor. It almost chubbed him up a bit. He muttered his &quot;no homos&quot; to himself, even without an audience, and then went about his business.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t care for the bodybuilder types most of the time, but he did find the more aesthetically aligned among them rather more understandable. And hence this was what drove Alec to a shocking amount of appreciation of a body he&#39;d have previously scoffed at. Bringing his arms up, he flashed a broad, pearly whites filled smile as he flexed his arms...<br />
<br />
He thought he heard a noise like someone checking the door, though, and that cut his time for enjoyment down drastically. Figuring he could always enjoy himself at home, when his well shined mirrors were always immediately available to catch his most appealing traits, Alec promptly headed into the shower.<br />
<br />
Washing off his sweat proved surprisingly enjoyable, as it let him well and truly acquaint himself with the body he was SURELY &quot;earning&quot; through his &quot;hard work&quot; as a wrestler. He wondered if Coach would move him up in weight class over this. &quot;He bettah, cuz I&#39;m fucking jacked, son.&quot; Alec didn&#39;t know why he was chattering like that or even talking like that in general, but he shrugged and went on with his shower.<br />
<br />
His slightly more curly, crinkly hair felt good with water flowing through it, and he didn&#39;t even blink at the fact the water seemed to make his tanned body even further shine with this look, rather than abate it in any meaningful fashion. Once he was good and done, Alec dried off with his towel and headed to go put on some other street clothes.<br />
<br />
Noting that his clothes were slightly odd fitting on him and not particularly feeling natural for him, he decided he was going to need to use his parents&#39; money to go buy some new clothes. Hopefully something that more fitted and flattered his physique, as fine as it was. Now dressed in a white tank top, jeans, and sneaker shoes, shuffling his sweat stained clothes into his locker, Alec headed out.<br />
<br />
He heard people chatting about him, girls and even some boys discussing how well his body filled his clothes and his appearance. Some discussions were more flattering than others. But throughout, he got the distinct sensation he was more attractive than usual to his peers.<br />
<br />
Returning to the scheduled class appropriately saw the teacher not even blink at his late entrance, after all, Alec was free to do as he was wont to do. And if he wasn&#39;t, a fancifully large donation was sure to set that to rights. As Alec tried to get his posterior seated right, once again having difficulty getting his seating arrangement comfortable, he mused that the day could not go by fast enough. He was feeling oddly disinterested in school - like he knew all he needed, and anything else was just periphery.<br />
<br />
He shook his head, Alec looking around and feeling tempted to whistle at his usual pining targets within his class...but stopping when he realized making such a distraction was not like him. He shook his head. To be so randy so soon after enjoying his hot MILF teacher&#39;s body...damn, it was like he had a furnace burning inside him.<br />
<br />
Alec thought about what to do from here once the class ended a surprisingly drawn out feeling thirty minutes later...</p>
