<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first few steps out of the house were the hardest for Jeff. But after realizing that he is not only fully naked, but that Emma is resting her cock on top of his head too, he gave up on working about it. No one around is even reacting to them anyways. <br />
<br />
Emma guides Jeff to the right and then down the sidewalk. But after a out 50 steps, Jeff suddenly stops moving forwards and shakes his head rapidly. &quot;Emma, please get it off of my nose. It&#39;s yours anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused by what Jeff means by that, Emma hops off of him and walks around to his front side. She nearly bursts out laughing when she finds a glob of her precum has dripped down onto his nose. She wipes it off, then feeds it to him by shoving her finger into his proper open mouth. &quot;I&#39;ll try and drip it closer to your mouth next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you just not?&quot; Asks Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why? Don&#39;t you like the taste?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the problem here. I don&#39;t want to do this like this. It&#39;s different if I am pleasuring you intentionally. But this is basically you just getting yourself off while riding on my back&quot; complains Jeff with a huff. Emma actually got even more aroused hearing this for some reason and her cock twitched upwards and flung up more of her precum, only now getting over both of them. <br />
<br />
Jeff of course recoiled from being splattered all along his lower half, while Emma giggled as she wiped off her face. &quot;Sorry about that. It just does that sometimes.&quot; She then wipes off what she can from him as well and once again feeds it all to him with her fingers. Jeff licks her clean of course, but is still annoyed by her antics. &quot;Hahhhh, let&#39;s just walk back inside. I can then make a setting change to us to stop your random cock twitches and oozing precum issue or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff goes to turn about but Emma hops onto his back again and turns him back ahead again. &quot;Oh no we aren&#39;t. We are finishing this outing first, then we can do something about this afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff, unable to disobey her steering, just walks in her intended path reluctantly. He doesn&#39;t even get why they are doing this. She made everyone see them as normal, so any possible excitement from humiliation/exhibition play wasn&#39;t even here either. &quot;What is this all about anyways? Was there a need to go out on a walk like this?&quot; He asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to see the town without the altered reality blocking my mind like it was before. Seeing a town full of women, all with varying amounts of breasts and animalistic cock is such a unique experience. Plus I find riding you like a horse is for some reason really turning me on right now. I don&#39;t really get it. Maybe feeling your body move underneath me is doing something for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, I guess that&#39;s a pretty good reason then. But we should get home pretty soon too. Even though you did wipe it off, I still feel kind of sticky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough. Maybe we can make our skin not stick to cum after this? Then cum should just slip right off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far...&quot; blushes Jeff. Emma grins at this, knowing exactly why he would be against it. &quot;Right, you don&#39;t actually hate being like this at all, and it just is the sticky part that bothers you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you even know all of this about me? I don&#39;t even know half of this stuff about myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If I had to guess, perhapse it&#39;s a side effect of you making changes to us? I don&#39;t know really, I just happen to know a lot of your fetishes for some reason. It&#39;s kinda fun to use it to mess with you and since I know you like it, it&#39;s even better then.&quot; Grins Emma as she taps her heels back against Jeff&#39;s breasts, forcing a moan out of him. &quot;Just like that. You asked me not to do it. But you actually like me doing it to you, and would have been disappointed if I hadn&#39;t done it at all, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s prolonged silence spoke for him and Emma knew she was right. She then did it 2 more times before they got back home, both of which were when many people were nearby. No one really reacted outside of giving them an unamused look, but that judging reaction was enough for Jeff, for now.<br />
<br />
When they got back inside, Jeff sighed once the bit was removed and walked over the the sink to wipe himself clean. Meanwhile, Emma had some more ideas and made a beeline for the Chronivac. She first changed everyone&#39;s ability to speak about Jeff and forced them to all use feminine pronouns reguardless of how they felt about it. Only the two of them would notice it though. Next she made Jeff able to consume cum through her skin. She also lengthened Jeff&#39;s tongue significantly so that Jeff can reach every inch of her entire face, including the top of her forehead and the back of her ears with ease. But that&#39;s not all, Jeff could now lick her own pussy with it if she needed to, but it would feel like a bit of a stretch to go further than just inside of it. This way she won&#39;t have to clean Jeff off all the time as Jeff can just lick herself clean.<br />
<br />
As a sudden idea, Emma found that she like the thought of Jeff having a more appropriate length neck. So she made the change, giving Jeff the neck length of a mare who is the same size. Now Jeff also could look behind her own head without as much of an issue, while also being able to reach the ground too with her new tongue. This change she makes Jeff unaware of though.<br />
<br />
Finally, she makes Jeff&#39;s middle breasts each have an outward facing pouch that normally is closed up tightly and hard to see from the outside. However, if she is riding on Jeff, then those pouches will open up, allowing for her to stick her feet into them for balance, kind of like natural stirrups. <br />
<br />
This handles all of her current plans for Jeff. And now it is for her own changes, beginning with lengthening her own tongue too. Now she can reach around her girlfriend&#39;s face while she is mounted ontop of her back. Emma let&#39;s her tongue flop out and begins stroking her cock with it while she continues making some more changes.</p>
