<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, just like when Isaac was reliving visions from the oracle mirror, Dark Isaac now knows what it feels like to relive a memory. He is currently sparing with a wizard looking teenager. If fact, the wizard has similar features to Nathan, even if he looks nothing like him. The person he is currently living as is obviously a teenage swordsman of a similar built to Isaac. Probaly a squire judging by how you he looked but his display of skills tells otherwise.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Calmach and Ederic were once again sparring on the usual spot. Ederic with his knight&#39;s armor and sword and Calmach with his silly wooden staff and funky blue wizards cloths with yellow stars sowed on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Calmach! That outfit is better suited for a jester! Do you honestly expect to wear that! None of the senior wizards I seen never bothered with those things.&quot; Ederic said in between swipes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just receive this standard magic institute uniform today! Just because no one else in the magic institute bothers to wear it doesn&#39;t mean I should follow their example! I tell you Ederic! One day, the Magic institute will be a respected school!&quot; Calmach shouted back. His wooden staff has seen better days...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! That will be the day! Everyone who knows the Magic Insitute knows that everyone there are just phonies, magicians, swindlers. I&#39;ll tell you now, and I&#39;ll tell you for the last time! THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC!&quot; Ederic debated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? Then explain why there are witch hunts! Better yet, tell me how the black death ended if it wasn&#39;t the work of fire magic!&quot; Calmach demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of all the the witches I seen, none of them used magic. And the Black Death was defeated by god. Not some so-called fire magic! Read the right history books!&quot; Ederic shouted back.<br />
<br />
As the wanna-be knight and wizard spared, a dirty teenage girl in peasants cloths calmly walked up to the duo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ederic! Calmach! Stop this instant! I have a favor to ask of you!&quot; The girl demanded.<br />
<br />
The two boys imedily stopped their fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Alice?&quot; Ederic asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My father has made a amazing discovery in the the cave were wizards come to practice their magic!&quot; Alice proudly proclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that &quot;warlock&quot; of a father?&quot; Ederic mocked.<br />
<br />
Alice looked peeved. &quot;My father is a scientist! Don&#39;t you dare compare him to those frauds!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that, yet he has been studying that cave for weeks. What is it this time? Some strange runes from our ancestors?&quot; Calmach asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you still haven&#39;t explained what a si-ee-test is.&quot; Eideric added.<br />
<br />
Alice gave a annoyed snort. &quot;Just come with me. It&#39;s much more then any old writings on the walls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before the two boys could question her anymore, she ran off.<br />
<br />
The two childhood friends looked at each other in confusion before following Alice through the woods.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
When they entered the cave, everything seems as it should. weird glowing runes on the walls. The occasional writings from a long lost civilization, and of corse, there are a bunch of idiots who are pretending to cast magic.<br />
<br />
But as they reached the far end of the cave, things started seeming different from before. At some point, they went from walking through a cave made of stone to a cave made of glass. Reflective glass in fact. The walls, flor and ceiling all look like a mirror. Edenic recalled this area being a normal stone cave lit by torched the last time he been here. How did stone changed into glass over night?<br />
<br />
 It was getting a little hard to navigate. But luckily, it didn&#39;t take them long to to reach the end of the cave and find Alice&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
Alice&#39;s father weares long, white robes, not unlike what the pope wears. The only thing preventing people from agusing him of impersonation the pope is that his robe is missing all the symbols that signifies him as a pope. He also doesn&#39;t were a popes hat. The white robes are also not made by the same material as a pope&#39;s robe. That didn&#39;t stop people from accusing him of impersonating the pope.<br />
<br />
 For now, Alice&#39;s father&#39;s title as a warlock is just that. A title. It only holds meaning in the magic institute. It simply means he is one of the head members of the guild. He might as well be the guild headmaster. The magic institute itself is really a small guild of people who believes in magic. But to avoid persecution, they mostly live in these caves. Calmach himself was born and raised by the magic institute as a orphan. Just yesterday, was he finally recognized as a full fledged member of the guild of wanna-be wizards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Father. I have brought Calmach and his friend.&quot; Alice announced.<br />
<br />
Alice&#39;s father turned around, the robes making him look like the world&#39;s first lab coat scientist. He even has primitive glasses to complete the look. His name is Herald Galestron. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh. If it isn&#39;t Ederic! Finally decided to join the institute?&quot; Herald asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not! You&#39;re not going to convince me that magic exist.&quot; Ederic returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. That kind of thinking will get you killed, boy. But I partially agree with you. In my years of studying, I have discovered that magic is more tied to our world then you think. Evil spirits that causes illnesses can be manipulated and fire is not the only thing the causes heat. A lot of magical occurrences are usually caused by natural things from our world. Heat is also caused by the sun. The condition of the food you eat and how warm you are can help ward off the evil spirits. What did you call magic that came from our world, Alice?&quot; Herald asked his daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Science, father.&quot; Alice happily answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, yes. For now, it&#39;s probably best to call natural magic, science.&quot; Herald declared.<br />
<br />
He waved to the mirrored walls. &quot;Yet, here we have something that was not created naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t these walls made of stone yesterday? How did they transform stone into glass over night?&quot; Calmach asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t yet know the cause, but with some research, I&#39;m sure we will find out soon enough. But I have the sinking feeling that this glass was not created by means from our world&quot; Herald stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t glass created from super heated rock? I learned that from a local smith. Maybe someone left a fire burning last night&quot; Calmach suggested.<br />
<br />
Herald shook his head. &quot;I have more reasons to think that this part of the cave was transformed into mirror glass by otherworldly means.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father. Are you going to show them?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, yes. Darling, fetch me a unlit torch.&quot; Harald asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Alice left the room for a bit, then came back with a unlit torch. Alice handed over the torch.<br />
<br />
Herald held up the unlit torch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Observe.&quot; He touched the unlit torch against the mirrored wall. Herald then closed his eyes in concentration. Suddenly, the torch was instantly lit.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?! Were did the fire come from?! What lit the torch?!&quot; Edenic demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;The mirrors. I wanted to light the torch and the walls provided the energy. I theorize that these mirror walls provides the user what they desire. Go on. Put your hand on it and imagine what you desire the most.&quot; Harald encouraged.<br />
<br />
Edenic was first to touch the mirrored wall. He thought about being the best knight there is. With the most respect and the most powerful to back up that respect.<br />
<br />
The glass glowed momentary as Ederic&#39;s armor changed. It became very shiny and polished and it it reconfigured itself to best help Ederic in battle.<br />
<br />
Edenic stared at awe at his new and improved armor. &quot;Is this real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. It&#39;s real. It&#39;s very real. It seems this glass can materialize the user&#39;s desire into physical form.  Though I don&#39;t think this is science. The fire and your armor has to come from somewhere. Whatever it is, I don&#39;t think the power from this glass is from our world. I thinks the mirror transfers the laws of nature from other worlds and allies it the the user&#39;s desires.&quot; Herald theorized.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean headmaster?&quot; Calmach asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. I can only theorize what this glass is for now. I need more time to study it to confirm any of my wild theories. Say... why don&#39;t you give the glass a try?&quot; Herald encouraged.<br />
<br />
Calmach placed his hand on the glass. As soon as he did, he felt something inside him change. But when he took back his hand, he noticed he looks the same. But he felt different. He held out his his hand in hopes that his dreams came true. <br />
<br />
&quot;IGNIRA!&quot; Calmach shouted. Suddenly, a floating fireball sparked into existence above his outstretched hand.<br />
<br />
Calmach couldn&#39;t believe it! He actually cast his first spell! He&#39;s using real magic! Not just some form of trickery or delusion but real otherworldly magic!<br />
<br />
The group crowded around the floating ball of magical energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I theorized that something like this might be possible, but to think the mirror gave you the power to cast magic?! Can you do anything else?&quot; Herald questioned.<br />
<br />
Calmach closed his hand and the fireball extinguished itself. Calmach feels as though the mirror has transplanted foreign knowledge into his head. It feels like he has all the knowledge he needs on how to cast real magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;STILLERA!&quot; Calmackch shouted. Suddenly, a floating ball of icy energy was floating above his hand. With ease, he casually tossed it at a nearby work bench. The rickety old stool was suddenly encased in ice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calmach my boy! What a amazing breakthrough! To think these strange mirror rocks could bestow knowledge and power in addition to providing energy and enhancing material! There is so much potential we can do with this mirror ore! Calmach, can you teach us what you know of unnatural magic? Alice! Fetch the rest of the magic institute members! They need to hear this amazing discovery!&quot; Herald was blabbering like a child who just got  his birthday present early.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The memory ended and the spirit of Ederic had a knowing look on his face with his arms crossed over his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;And that is how magic was first introduced into our world&quot; Ederic explained.<br />
<br />
Wait a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought Calmach was speculated to be the warlock who started the corruption!?&quot; Dark Isaac exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Ederic was nodding like he already heard that before. &quot;Judging by your memories, I could understand why you would think that. In a sense, that is true, but he and I really just brought magic into the world. You can even say Calmach invented it. The corruption came years after our time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ederic continued. &quot;Herald decided to call the strange new mirror like ore, miracle ore. Shortly after the discovery of miracle ore and magic, we converted the cave into a full blown mining facility. By then, the place was fully transformed into miracle ore. Even to this day, we aren&#39;t fully sure why the cave turned into miracle ore in the first place. The miracle ore only spread to the inside of the cave by the time I died. But then again, the ore probably spread beyond the cave by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When we reported to the king of our discovery of the miracle ore and what it could do, he ordered us to never disclose information about how the miracle ore could grant desires and wishes to the public. After the king found out the miracle ore could show possible pasts and futures, the miracle ore was renamed to oracle ore, and it became standard for royal oracles to be equipped with oracle ore. Despite publicly referring to the ore as oracle ore, some people refer to it as mirror ore due to it&#39;s reflective nature. I believe that&#39;s why Isaac knows it as mirror ore. For years and probably to this day, everyone believed oracle ore was just a means to see possible futures or pasts. The only ones who knew of the oracle ore&#39;s true power was Herald, Alice, Calmach, me and a select few members of the magic institute who was present when we first discovered it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When we told the king what the ore was capable of, he didn&#39;t just told us to keep the ore&#39;s true capabilities a secret. Nor did he just kept the ore exclusive to royal oracles. He ordered a temple to be built over and around the glass cave so it&#39;s power will never be misused. For years, the oracle ore mine was sealed away by the walls of the temple.&quot; Ederic explained. It took a moment for Ederic to gather his thoughts. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think the citadel members occupied the temple soon afterwards, but judging from Isaac&#39;s memories, they have long since moved out. I believe the area is now known as Calmach&#39;s Crypt.&quot; Ederic recalled as he shuffled through Isaac&#39;s memories.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a silver lining to the meeting. The true potential of the oracle ore is to be kept secret, but The Magic Institute was recognized as a official organization once we showed the king the wonders of magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The rest was history.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic became common practice. Even house wives started using it for house work. By the time we were in our prime, almost everyone was using magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was later discovered that my new armor had the ability to assimilate metal and other such ores. My armor was able to channel the power of magic and other otherworldly energy. My pitch black and spiky, almost living and easily reshape able armor has earned me the title of  dark knight.  But before you ask, I never tried assimilating oracle ore. I was afraid of what could happen. I wish I tried though... It could have saved my life...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac sensed that there was more to the story.  &quot;So what happened next? How did you became the possessed armor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ederic let out a sigh. &quot;When me and Calmach were in our mid thirties, we returned to the mirror ore mining facility. We had to break into the temple. A lot of citadel guards died that day. We both intended on granting more of our desires from the glass. But we caught each other, and in our blind greed we fought each other in the mirror cave that started it all. Powerful Magic and Metal clashed as we waged our legendary battle. But in the end, we only succeeded in destroying the glass mining facility and killing each other. I became the possessed piece of dark armor you know today. I don&#39;t know what happened to Calmach&#39;s spirit, but he definitely died that day. I think you can still find the ruins of the mirror cave somewhere in Calmach&#39;s Crypt.&quot; Ederic explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I understand the king&#39;s reasoning. Power corrupts. I think that&#39;s why scholars thinks Calmach started the corruption. Because me and Calmach discovered first hand the mirror&#39;s true colors. The mirror ore grants us our desires and eventually corrupts our souls with power lust... but then again, they probably think we did it because the corrupt appeared in the same area we had our final battle.&quot; Ederic let out a humorless laugh but he quickly silenced himself. He paused for a moment. As if he was ashamed to disclose such humiliating secrets.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac silently digested the new information.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened to Herald and Alice?&quot; Dark Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. Herald retired from being head master so Calmach can take his place. I&#39;ve seen Herald every once in a while afterwards, but not enough for me to pay attention to his whereabouts. But he never seemed to age whenever I do see him...  Alice was helping me break into the temple but we were separated before I entered the cave. I haven&#39;t seen her since. Though that witch from the mansion looks familiar... But that can&#39;t be her. It&#39;s been centuries!&quot; Ederic explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re telling me that oracle ore that formed out of nowhere simultaneously started magic and the order of the dark knights? So you really don&#39;t know were the mirror ore came from in the first place?&quot; Dark Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Of the many years I lived, I still don&#39;t know why a ordinary stone cave suddenly turned into a glass cave that can grant wishes. It&#39;s rumored that someone might have accidentally written runes on the walls that could have changed the stone into mirror ore, but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that could prove that. But thanks to Isaac&#39;s memories, I can theorize. You know how Azaviel&#39;s cum can create purple crystals? What if the oracle ore is a extension of a god-like being&#39;s aurora? A being powerful enough to effect the multiverse. What if the mirror ore was created for the soul purpose to corrupt? To give others enough power to cause other people grief. To Create villains by giving them power. But that was just a theory. A Myth Theory! Thanks for listening!&quot; Ederic finished.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac was not impressed by Ederic&#39;s weak attempt at humor. &quot;Didn&#39;t you say I was running out of time? Why am I still here? Shouldn&#39;t I have woken up by now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ederic waved around him. &quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed the seal that was placed while we were talking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac looked around to see a wall of blue glowing runes surrounding them.<br />
<br />
&quot;With how unstable things were, there was no doubt you were going to wake up. But ever since this strange seal was placed, things has calmed down. Don&#39;t quote me on this but I think you now have the choice to when you wake up. You can stay here as long as you want.&quot; Ederic explained.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac narrowed his eyes. &quot;And why would I want to stay here when I have a body to take back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ederic looked amused. &quot;You wanted to be a Dark Knight right? If you stick around, I can train you in the art of the dark knight. Or at least on how I know it. I can show you creative ways on using the power of lust. Or better yet, how to use the power you obtained from the souls you captured. If you wake yourself up from your coma, I&#39;m not sure you will be able to go back to the state of mind were you can talk to me again. After all, we are two halves of each other now, and its not everyday you can talk to what&#39;s essentially yourself.&quot; Ederic offered.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac weighed his options. Ederic had a good point. If Dark Isaac wakes up now, there is no guarantee that he will be able to communicate with Sir Ederic again. On the other hand, that goody two shoes of a brother is probably regaining control of his body right now. But despite that, Dark Isaac can&#39;t help but agree with one of Isaac&#39;s philosophies. That patience is key. Perhaps it&#39;s best that he trains with the spirit of the possessed armor before he fights Isaac again...</p>
