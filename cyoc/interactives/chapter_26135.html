<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vix had quickly finished reading the note and gazed into Lisa’s eyes. “Dan wants to see you.” Then her attention went towards the red-eyed Solange. “All of you,” Vix said with a sense of finality in her voice. She handed Lisa the note. “He’s going to call you to set up a meeting, in three hours,” she said, checking the time. It was currently 11:30 PM.<br />
<br />
Before Lisa was going to tear the note into shreds, Vix placed her hands on Lisa’s. “We’ll get through this.” Lisa was quivering in anger, in direct contrast to Vix’s calm disposition. What does she know about this, Lisa wondered. She eyed Vix.<br />
<br />
“You’re angry, and you have every right to be. But don’t you see? Dan is playing on your emotions. He wants you to think irrationally.” Vix had a pleading look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Lisa’s temperament started to cool down. With a deep growl in her voice, Lisa asked. “What do you know about this?”<br />
<br />
Vix briefly looked at the crumpled note in Lisa’s hands. She still doesn’t trust me, Vix thought. Deciding to be forthcoming with the knowledge of the situation, Vix told her of what she knew. “Dan was trying to find a way to get to one of you. I thought he was going to try to pick you off one by one, so I stationed officers at all of your homes. Dan must have known about this and decided to go to the places where your pack members worked. Unfortunately, Sharon was the only viable target at this time of day.”<br />
<br />
The rest of group pulls up in their vehicles and ran over to Solange. They all consoled her on the unforeseeable event. Lisa also went over, dropping the note. Vix bent down to pick it up, and saw an image that brought back some of her own memories. She saw all of them huddled together, coping together. Vix stood alone, watching them and reflecting on herself. No wonders why they don’t trust me, Vix pondered, it was the simple matter that they all share one thing in common, lycanthropy. They accepted each other just like how I was accepted before… Vix notices that her mind had started to wander. No, I will never be like them, she concluded while bringing her own thoughts into cohesion.<br />
<br />
Several minutes pass as Vix started to comb the area. She didn’t want to disturb their get together. It was best that they get over it now and be focused later on what’s to come. Finding nothing of particular interest, Vix walked back toward the group. Solange had composed herself and everyone else seemed more settled down than before.<br />
<br />
“Find anything?” Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” Vix replied. “There are no traces of apparent struggle, no cameras taping this area, no shell casings…”<br />
<br />
“That means she’s still alive!” excitedly interrupted Solange.<br />
<br />
“Or that Dan picked up after himself.” Vix realized that losing the little hope they had left may not be wise. “But Dan doesn’t have a silencer and gunfire would have alerted authorities to this area. So, yes she is alive.”<br />
<br />
“What is the FBI going to do to find Sharon?” Debra entered.<br />
<br />
Another difficult question, Vix continued. “Nothing,” she quietly said. There was an apparent shock around everyone including the rising frustration in Lisa. “I’m on my own. I was denied surveillance and backup because someone upstairs didn’t agree of my plan to inform you all on what was going on.” That may not be entirely true, Vix thought, Blackhorn just didn’t want her to be the one to inform them. “I sent a request to my department to have control of the Ranger team, but it’s been over five hours now.”<br />
<br />
Ebony started to voice her opinion. “The police can…”<br />
<br />
“Do nothing,” Vix interjected venomously. “Not only would that complicate matters, but it would risk involving people that have no idea of the existence of lycanthropes. Also, Dan was a federal agent so he’ll be anticipating anything plausible to occur. More than likely, he’ll be monitoring police scanners to check.”<br />
<br />
Ebony was taken back on Vix’s attitude. Calmly, Vix tried to mollify matters. “I’m sorry Ebony, I didn’t mean for what I said to hurt.” Vix looked down for a moment and took a breath. “Please, I’m trying to do whatever I can to help. I’ve declassified information, protected the secret of lycanthropes, and trusted you all with my humanity.” Looking up with resolution, she asked. “Will you trust me?” Vix had played out her cards, it was now or never.<br />
<br />
Lisa contemplated on everything that happened. Some parts of her still blamed the FBI for getting involved in this. Lisa couldn’t help but feel that there was something Vix was holding back, but Vix was the one that shed light on what was going on. Everything she had said and shown made sense. Vix also took a chance of personally getting involved, forgoing backup if what she said was true. There was one other thing Lisa wanted to know before she started trusting Vix with the situation. “This afternoon, you said that you were going to be armed during the meeting. Were you, dear?”<br />
<br />
Taking another deep breath, Vix responded. “No, I wasn’t armed. You said that you would respect my wishes; I didn’t feel it was necessary. If you want to see my crossbow, it’s in the trunk of my mustang.” Vix pushed a button on her remote key that opened her trunk. “I’ll show it to you.”<br />
<br />
They all walked to the black mustang. Vix raised the rear hood. They all crowded around to peer what was under. Several gasped at what they saw. Inside, there was an array of different firearms and weapons, several survival equipments, and an average sized folder briefcase. They all fitted snugly into individual squares of black foam molding to prevent them from bumping around. Vix reached for the metallic briefcase. Anaya was the most curious and was about to touch a polished pistol closest to her. “Careful!” Vix warned. “The pistols are silver plated.” With that statement, Anaya retracted her arm from the trunk. There were several worried glances around the group. Vix pulled out the briefcase toward her, and unsnapped two buckles. Once the briefcase was opened, numerous vials filled with different liquids were revealed. Vix carefully removed the black foam layer inside the briefcase that contained the vials. Underneath it was Vix’s prized weapon, a small retractable repeater crossbow. “There,” Vix said flatly. Everyone else was still in awe of sudden display of Vix’s trunk. “I have licenses for all of them,” Vix said with some humor.<br />
<br />
Lisa was slightly overwhelmed in what she saw. She was right that Vix wasn’t an ordinary FBI agent. Although Vix showed her the weapon in question, there were so many other questions now. This special branch Vix is with, what do they do? Was she really sent here to catch Ramer or was there some other purpose? Why is she so prepared for a war? Or is she always prepared?<br />
<br />
Lisa turned to look at Vix, who also returned her stare. Lisa thoughts then lingered on what’s happening. Vix had just shown something that would be potentially damaging to herself. She had passed the test that she wasn’t armed, and had willingly placed herself in what could have been dangerous situation. Lisa admired Vix’s courage and determination. Oh, the possibilities if Vix were with us, she marveled. It was enough to earn her trust in getting Sharon back, but if there was one sign of betrayal, she’ll make sure Vix will never have a chance to strike.<br />
<br />
“Do you trust me now?” Vix coolly asked as she started putting everything back to the way they were.<br />
<br />
“That’s up to all of us,” Lisa answered. Once Vix had closed the trunk, Lisa went on. “Can you give us a moment, dear?” Vix nodded.<br />
<br />
Lisa moved the away from earshot of Vix and quietly talked amongst each other.<br />
<br />
Vix watched and several of them took a nervous glimpse of her. Vix had planned to gradually earn their trust. Due to Dan’s actions however, Vix needed to risk everything given the time constraint. But, Dan wasn’t the reason that she didn’t bring her crossbow to the meeting. It was something else that she couldn’t understand. Fortunately, it played out to her luck which she seldom believed in. Vix knew she was in deep. There were moments when she doubted herself from the meeting to this. It was typically vengeance that fueled her on the field that pushed her on, but now its hope. Hope that this will all end well. Vix scoffed at herself. Nothing ever ends well, she contradicted. When did a mission ended in a happily ever after? Never… at least, not for me.<br />
<br />
The group dispersed to their vehicles while Lisa approached Vix. “We’re meeting back at the District Attorney’s Office. We’re going to plan how to get Sharon back.” She paused. “Your welcome to come along, dear. We can use your knowledge on Dan”<br />
<br />
Vix smiled and nodded. “I have detailed files.”</p>
