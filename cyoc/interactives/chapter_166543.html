<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Well I don&#39;t know. I feel like I&#39;m made of plastic, but I&#39;m not all plastic. I really don&#39;t know. I give up&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll give you a clue. I bet your mother uses one of what we are but I doubt your father does&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You haven&#39;t turned me into a sanitary pad have you? That&#39;s disgusting&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No. But if I said you are cherry flavoured and I&#39;m apricot does that help?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Lollies? But what if we get eaten?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No. Not lollies. Lipsticks you dufus. I turned us into tubes of lipstick in Gabby&#39;s purse. So all we have to do is stay here and we will be taken to the slumber party&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;How do we change back? How long are we going to be like this for?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I set 12 hours&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well I hope you&#39;re right. I&#39;d hate to be stuck like this. What&#39;s that smell? Peppermint?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah. I smell that as well. I guess Gabby has some mints in the purse&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I think I&#39;m getting motion sickness. All this wobbling about in the dark. I feel like I&#39;m in a washing machine&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Lucky you don&#39;t have a mouth then. I guess without a mouth you can&#39;t spew. Anyhow be quiet. I&#39;m trying to hear what the girls are saying&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;How can I hear you anyway? If I&#39;m a tube of lipstick I wouldn&#39;t have ears and you wouldn&#39;t have a mouth&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just how it is. Now be quiet I think they are talking about boys. I want to listen&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff was quiet. He wasn&#39;t happy at the predicament Marc had got him into. Like Marc he could hear the girls talking it sounded quite muffled and they could only hear about every third word. It became better when Gabby spoke. That made sense as they were in her purse.<br />
<br />
&#39;What about ....... ..... ......&#39; Do you .... him?&#39; That sounded like Maria one of Gabby&#39;s best friends.<br />
<br />
&#39;He&#39;s Adorable but ...... ....... ....... ......&#39; they heard from another female voice. Possibly Susan.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ha I knew you liked him&#39; said a close-by Gabby followed by a giggle.<br />
<br />
&#39;You ...... talk Gab....... ....... so many admirers&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah, but look at the quality of them&#39; said Gabby.<br />
<br />
&#39;...... ....... ........ ...... ....... .........&#39; Jeff couldn&#39;t make out word. but it sounded like Susan&#39;s tones.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ha, your so funny!&#39; Gabby was giggling and the purse was jiggling about. &#39;It can be so embarrassing . Have you seen how they drool if I twist my hair with my fingers?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff thought Gabby was so sexy when she did that. Gabby had long wavy red hair.<br />
<br />
&#39;Enough of ........ ...... nerds&#39; said Maria. &#39;Who do ...... ....... the hot&#39;s for?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Shane, the new guy. He&#39;s such a spunk&#39; That was Gabby once more. All too loud for Jeff. Indeed he had to endure the girls talking about the qualities of Shane, that made him so attractive for the next 5 minutes. Gabby liked the fact that Shane was tall, muscular and dark haired. All qualities that Jeff did not possess. He was relieved when the girls apparently arrived at the party house and the conversation stopped.<br />
<br />
All went well again for 10 minutes. There was lot&#39;s of giggling and and idle chatter than the boy&#39;s heard Linda the host tell the other girls Put your bags in my bedroom then we can go and have a swim&#39;<br />
<br />
Shortly after that the purse was apparently put on a shelf or quiet possibly Linda&#39;s bed. They heard the door close and then silence. They were still in almost total darkness and could no longer hear any conversation just the very occasional giggle or scream from a long way away.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Marc had no way to tell the passing of time. However it seemed like hours before there was any movement. During that time Jeff had a go at Marc once more &#39;Next time don&#39;t put us inside the purse. I&#39;d rather be the purse. At least then I would be able to see&#39;<br />
<br />
Eventually a girl came back into the room. For ages whoever it was, was silent. They could here wardrobes opening and closing and could smell chlorine. It seemed they were now acclimatised to the peppermint smell.<br />
<br />
From a distance they heard. &#39;Linda, are you in there. I need to get my perfume&#39; it sounded like Gabby.<br />
 <br />
Then from closer but no doubt in the room &#39;Wait a minute, I&#39;m just getting changed&#39; That was Linda.<br />
<br />
The boys could hear Linda hurrying a bit more. Then heard the door open and Linda ask &#39;Could you zip me up Gab&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Sure&#39; They heard a zip moving up. &#39;Wow nice dress&#39; said Gabby. <br />
<br />
&#39;Thanks. I bought it for this party. You don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bit risque?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Just as well we are all girls here. I imagine you would be a teenage boys wet dream. Is that real silk?&#39; said Gabby. <br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah&#39; replied Linda. Unfortunately Jeff and Marc could only imagine what Linda looked like. They were still in almost total darkness. <br />
<br />
They were stunned by brightness when Gabby must have opened her purse. Jeff was momentarily touched by Gabby&#39;s fingers as she felt inside the purse. For about 30 seconds he could make out the ceiling of Linda&#39;s room but no vision of either of the girls. They heard Gabby applying her perfume and could smell the strong scent. However all too quickly a glass bottle was thrown on top of Jeff and the bag was zipped up once more. They were back in darkness. The girls left.<br />
<br />
&#39;Did you get a glimpse of either of the girls?&#39; asked Jeff<br />
<br />
&#39;No&#39; replied Marc. &#39;I couldn&#39;t see a thing. I&#39;ll admit turning us into lipstick tubes probably wasn&#39;t the greatest idea I have ever had&#39;<br />
<br />
Indeed it was another eternity before the boys heard anything else. That was the singing of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in the distance. About the same time the faint glow coming through the bag faded. Jeff guessed it had got dark outside. The light must not be on in the room.<br />
<br />
At least Jeff had Marc to talk to. They theorised about how they could communicate with each other, deciding they must have developed some sort of ESP. They certainly were not actually talking however they could read each others thoughts but only if the &quot;sender&quot; wanted to communicate those thoughts. How was as much a mystery as how they had become lipstick tubes in the first place.<br />
<br />
Jeff had just decided that this was the most boring twelve hours he had ever experienced when someone came back into the room. He felt the purse been lifted up.</p>
