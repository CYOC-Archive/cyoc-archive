<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Duke strolled the corridors of the Tepes Manor, he now reviewed reports from within the human and vampire realm. Things were still tense, the Normal seemingly pausing after their attacks on Wyatt, the wizards, and the anthros. Reports speculated that another attack was coming, where though was a matter of discussion. All though were on high alert, making the dhamphir wonder how he had found himself embroiled in vampire politics.<br />
<br />
When Wyatt approached Duke about assisting in protecting his family, he was stunned. The brothers were dyametrically opposed. Duke associated with wizards and despised vampires with Wyatt his polar opposite. The one thing they seemed to have in common was caring for the quintuplets. That Duke would take steps to protect Wyatts children, warmed the vampires heart so to speak. This was how Duke and Sasha found themselves reviewing intelligence reports from various vampires scattered throughout the realms and offering their opinion to Wyatt. This led Duke to a realization, even after the threat of the Normal was neutralized, he would find himself closely involved with Wyatt and his children. &quot;Never thought this would happen,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Wonder what mom would think if she could see me now?&quot; As he now turned the corner, he paused as he watched his girlfriend and niece.<br />
<br />
Andromeda was now waving goodbye, speeding off to join her siblings, leaving Sasha alone once more. Studying his ebony haired girlfriend, he could see her clutching a piece of paper as her eyes appeared damp. &quot;Everything alright,&quot; he asked. Sasha jumped in surprise, quickly wiping her eyes and rubbing her face. &quot;Yeah great,&quot; she said quickly offering Duke a small smile. Duke simply nodded, walking towards his girlfriend. &quot;What&#39;s that,&quot; he asked pointing to the paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this,&quot; Sasha said quickly, trying to hide the paper. &quot;It&#39;s um nothing..just um..&quot; Sasha trailed off as Duke now gently reached for the paper. As he now looked it over a small smile crossed his face. Andromeda had drawn a picture of Sasha and herself, depicting the moment the wizard had given the young vampire her stuffed animal back. Despite the crudeness of the toddlers drawing, Duke could make out two smiling stick figures. One was of Andromeda, the small vampire smiling as Sasha, with her long black hair and blue eyes passed the bear to her. &quot;Thats adorable,&quot; Duke smiled. &quot;She made this for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sasha said softly, blushing slightly. &quot;Dromy even drew hearts around it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dromy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Short for Andromeda,&quot; Sasha replied defensively, noting the smirk on her boyfriends face. &quot;Dont give me that look! She wanted to say thank you so she drew me this picture. I think it&#39;s very sweet. She even hugged me afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is,&quot; Duke smiled, a pause lingering between the two as they gazed at the toddlers drawing. &quot;Had no idea you cared that much about Dromy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Sasha grumbled.<br />
<br />
Duke stifled a laugh, noting the sour look on his girlfriends face. Sasha always projected an air of toughness, a shield she rarely lowered. That the adorable vampire toddler had gotten her to lower her defenses to this degree was astounding. Not wanting to catch an elbow to the gut, Duke now tried his best to maintain a straight face. &quot;Hey what&#39;s that,&quot; Sasha said quickly pointing outside. &quot;Are you trying to change the subject,&quot; Duke asked, instinctively placing his arms around his stomach for protection. &quot;No I&#39;m being serious,&quot; Sasha grumbled, pointing outside. Duke now turned to where she was pointing, noting a carriage approaching the manor. At first puzzled, his face became serious as he noticed Hanako exit the carriage. &quot;They found her,&quot; he said softly. &quot;They found Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
After retaking the manor, Dracula began searching for his missing wife. It was presumed that Sashas spell returning Lisa&#39;s soul was successful, meaning Lisa needed to be found. This eventually led to Wyatt dispatching Ann to assist in the search and later Hanako. Hanako herself had no love for Dracula yet for Lisa it was different. She had heard the stories of Lisa from her own father and the possibility of finding the woman drove the dhamphir. For Alucard, Hanako would make sure Lisa was safe, despite her dislike of the original lord of the vampires. As she now lowered her hood to speak with Wyatt, both Duke and Sasha could see a tense meeting taking place. &quot;We need to move,&quot; Duke said quickly. &quot;Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly racing into the courtyard, Duke and Sasha watched the intense conversation between Kyra and Hanako. Not long ago, the queen of the vampires was Lisa&#39;s prisoner. During her confinement Kyra found herself beaten, brutalized, and in constant fear of what fate awaited her children at Lisa&#39;s hand. She, along with Cheyenne and Duchess, were only too familiar with Lisa&#39;s cruelty. All three now stood before Hanako, Sasha and Duke realizing Wyatt had not told them of his plans.<br />
<br />
Duke watched as the three women&#39;s features now shifted, their eyes becoming pools of inky darkness, their muscles swelling under their dresses as their fangs bared at the dhamphir. &quot;She can not come here,&quot; Kyra snarled. &quot;After what she did to me! To my handmaidens!To my children!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wyatt already stated that Lisa should stay here&quot; Hanako replied, her yellow eyes blazing. &quot;And if you lay a hand on her, I&#39;ll kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyra snarled, looking to her husband Wyatt, who now tried to appeal to his wife. Lisabwas different from last time. The vampires soul had returned,she wasn&#39;t their enemy anymore. She was family. Kyra though was not swayed, calling Lancelot and the other members of the Five to her side, save one. &quot;Ken what are you doing&quot; Kyra exclaimed.<br />
<br />
The blind vampire, turned towards his mistress, his vision obscured by the wrapping around his eyes. &quot;If Ann is by Lisa&#39;s side than I stand with Lisa,&quot; he said. &quot;You would betray your mistress,&quot; Lancelot bellowed, the vampiric knights face twisting into a feral snarl. &quot;No,&quot; Ken replied. &quot;I just no better than to oppose Ann.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke and Sasha shifted nervously, watching the family drama unfold. Kyra, Cheyenne, and the Five glaring at Lisa with murderous intent as Dracula, Hanako, Ann, and Ken stood in front of Lisa. Ann lowered at the Five, the child vampires body coiled like a snake ready to strike. The tension was palatable in this family standoff. Despite Wyatts best efforts to put Kyra at ease, it was proving to be unsuccessful. Duke and Sasha fearing that the family would tear eachother to pieces unless there was a miracle.<br />
<br />
It seemed though that even vampires could benefit from the miraculous.<br />
<br />
In the chaos of Lisa&#39;s return, none thought of placing the quints somewhere safe. As a result the sons and daughters of Wyatt and Kyra now watched the drama unfold.  The children, quietly stared at Lisa, remembering the scary woman who had traumatized them not long ago. While most of the kids seemed frozen in fear, one was not. Unnoticed by the adults, Nyx now began to slowly walk towards Lisa.<br />
<br />
Nyx was quieter than her siblings, yet somehow braver. Adorned in a dress the ebony haired toddler locked eyes with Lisa as she slowly walked towards her. It was only when she stood inches from the Mad Queen did the adults pause in their arguments, fearfully gazing at Nyx. The world now ent silent, fearful that Lisa would tear the child to pieces. Instead thw girl now slowly reached for Lisa&#39;, her tiny hand wrapping around Lisa&#39;s finger as she began to lead her towards the manor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nyx,&quot; Kyra whispered fearfully, watching as her pigtailed daughter now walked with Lisa. The Mad Queen was silent, her eyes wide in shock as this small girl led her home. She had never expected this, not after what she did. Nyx however seemed to forgive her, embracing Lisa as family as she led her to her new home.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened,&quot; Sasha asked. Wyatt smirked, the pride in his children overflowing. &quot;I think my daughter has just welcomed home the matriarch of the Tepes family.&quot;</p>
