<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Francisco waited in his classroom for the last of the people to leave the school.  Finally, the football practice was over and the last of the students and teachers were gone.  The only person that would be left would be the security guard….and he never came out of his office during the summer sessions.<br />
<br />
Francisco grabbed his pants, boxers, shoes, socks, tie and his briefcase.  Clad only in his now too long dress shirt, the thirteen year old man darted out of the classroom, down the hall to the parking lot door and headed for his car.  He didn’t run into anyone, thank goodness!<br />
<br />
Francisco unlocked his car door, threw his clothes and briefcase in and sat in the driver’s seat.  “What the fuck am I thinking!?” he said to himself, “I’m too short to drive now!”  He got out of the car and then he remembered his cel phone in the briefcase.  He could call Marco to come get him!  He had been so upset at becoming a young teen again, he never thought to call from the classroom.  <br />
<br />
He reached into the case in the car, took out the cel phone, popped up Marco’s number and started to hit “talk”….then a hand came from behind and snatched the cel phone.  Young Francisco turned around and was face to chest with Juan.  “I don’t think you need to call anyone little man.  You have an appointment with my fist…remember?”  Francisco pushed Juan with all his might…he hardly budged.  “Give me back my phone you shit!” Francisco said while trying to reach it held up high in Juan’s hand.  Juan’s three stooges…Ed, Dom and Joey…giggled every time Francisco’s shirt tail went up and exposed his lightly haired privates.  Juan grabbed Francisco’s shirt just under the collar and pushed the regressed teacher into a puddle on the ground…hard.  “You want your phone?Here, go get it!”  Juan threw the phone into the parking lot where it smashed into pieces.  Mr. Mendes saw his last chance to contact Marco for help destroyed…of course, he had no idea that Marco himself had been transformed into a nine month old baby at that time.<br />
<br />
Juan turned to Ed, Dom and Joey, “Grab him guys and drag his little ass to the locker room.”  They pulled Francisco out of the puddle and literally drug Mr. Mendes to the locker room.  He tried to fight all the way, but it was no use.  <br />
<br />
In the locker room, the boys threw Mendes onto the floor.  Juan had them hold Francisco down while he balled his hand into a fist.  “Oh this is going to be a pleasure.  I get to beat the shit outta you Mendes.” Juan said.  “I still Mr. Mendes to you Juan!” Francisco shouted.  Juan laughed, “You!?...You’re just barely out of grade school….You’re no mister!”  Juan reached down and grabbed the already tattered and muddy dress shirt.  He ripped the front open taking off the buttons and then ripped the whole shirt off.  Francisco was now totally naked.  “Ok guys…there’s your lesson in puberty for the day…even an adult can be a late bloomer.  Geeze Mendes a guy your age oughtta have more pubes than that.  I got more hair under my pits than you have down there.  Oh yeah….you’re not that old anymore…you’re a little Jr. High twit now!”  “Fuck you Juan,” Mendes shouted.  Juan let out another laugh, “Listen to that guys, even little he’s still a faggot.  Sorry Mendes, I do the fucking and it’s with the opposite sex.  Now back to beating the shit outta you!”  <br />
<br />
Francisco knew it was sink or swim time, “Oh yeah, you’re so big, Juan!  You have to have three guys bigger than me to hold me down!  Why don’t we just do this man to man!?”  Juan looked at him, “Let him go guys.  We WILL do this man to man…or in your case teeny weenie Mendes…Man to shrunken man!”<br />
<br />
Juan swung at Francisco.  Francisco darted out of the way so that Juan missed.  He then butted his head into Juan’s stomach.  It barely pushed the muscle bound, fourteen year old. Juan grabbed Mendes, picked him up and threw him to the ground.  He sat on top of the naked boy and pounded his fist into Francisco’s face.  Francisco managed to push Juan off, grab his legs and get him to the ground.  He punches Juan, but at his size it hardly made a dent in the teen.  Juan pinned Mendes again, punched him, picked him up so that his feet were off the ground and punched him hard and back down onto the floor.  Juan then yelled to Ed, Dom and Joey to hold Francisco.  Juan walked up to him, “You little pitiful boy…you’re just too small to beat me.  Now I’m gonna do this my way.”  Juan balled his fist as his stooges held young Mr. Mendes and then he punched Mendes once more in the Jaw.  It hurt Francisco, but he would not cry.  He looked up at Juan and said, “Fuck you!”  Juan kneeled down to the boy teacher’s level, “See little man, I did it my way and still beat the shit outta you to boot!”  Mendes spit in Juan’s face.  Juan Yelled and wiped, then lunged for the teen being held by his guys.  Then he stopped, wiped the spit from his hand onto Francisco’s face and said, “Get this little man!  You’re a kid again and I can do what ever I want to a runt like you.  I don’t know how this happened, but it’s the happiest damn day of my life, and if I figure out how you shrank back to a little teen, I gonna use it to give you a double dose and put you back into diapers…you got that you little prick!  If I don’t figure it out, I’m gonna beat you every chance I get!”  Juan picked Francisco up and shoved the naked teen into a corner…then he and his boys left.  Francisco cried just a little and then buried his head into his knees.<br />
<br />
Just then, Chris, one of the students who had witnessed his regression in class stepped out of the lockers.  Chris was thirteen, had a light but tone build and was also in the early stages of puberty.  He was in Jeans, a tee shirt, sneakers and glasses.  He had really thick brown hair and blue eyes…he also had a crush on Francisco.  He never wanted to act on it…after all, Mr. Mendes was an adult, but now that Mendes was his age, his insides had started to think of the possibilities…though still pretty impossible.<br />
<br />
He walked over and kneeled down to little Mr. Mendes, “Chris!” Mendes said, happy to see a friendly face. “I’m sorry Mr. Mendes,” Chris said, “I saw you going to your car and I was going ask how you made yourself so young.  Then I saw Juan break your phone and drag you in here.  I..I couldn’t have helped against all four of them and thought if I hid, I could help you later…Guess I shoulda helped.”  Francisco looked up at Chris, his eyes were wet and his lip bloody, “It’s just as well Chris.  You’d be like me now.  I shouldn’t have lost it like that…but right now, I kind of react like my age.”  Chris helped the naked teen stand…he couldn’t believe he was with Mendes at his own age and naked.  He tried not to stare, then he asked, “Can I help you get home.”  Mendes just nodded “yes”.  Chris went to his own locker and pulled out some shorts and a tank top for Francisco to wear.  Chris was a little bigger, but the clothes stayed on Francisco.  They left, no one was around…the Security guard was still in his office and unaware of anything…then they started walking to Francisco’s house.<br />

Meanwhile, at the house, Ric, Josh, Salvador and Peter were playing with nine month old Marco on the floor.</p>
