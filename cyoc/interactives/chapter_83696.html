<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment the two men had claimed their respective beds, a discussion of great importance commenced; who got the first shower. It had been a long flight to Japan, and they both felt a distinct need to clean themselves after spending what amounted to half a day traveling in confined places.<br />
<br />
“You know how badly I sweat, Jack. My shirt is sopping and if I didn’t know better, I’d say my antiperspirant’s been washed off.”<br />
<br />
“First, that is disgusting. Second, it was your choice that we traveled economy. I don’t see why I have to suffer any more than necessary.”<br />
<br />
“You could have taken up that responsibility and had us travel first class; instead you left everything up to me.”<br />
<br />
At this point, their transformations slowly became noticeable. They were fast approaching their teenage years, Jack’s receding hairline ceased to do so, while some of the extra weight on Greg dissipated. Not that either of them actually paid attention to this. The first thing that actually caught their attention was the fact they both sounded like teenagers.<br />
<br />
“Wha-*cough* what’s happening?” Jack squeaked, voice cracking as it rapidly grew higher in pitch.<br />
<br />
Before Greg could answer however, his brown hair shot out in rapid growth and swiftly turned a deep black. Jack’s own hair was quickly brightening to a much brighter blond than it had been while gaining a bit of body and fluff. Quickly passing 13, neither of them had time to notice breasts start to form only to shrink once again. They both stared in shock at each other, noting the youthful and girlish look of the other’s face. It was quite obvious by now that Greg was the smaller of the two, and the difference only grew as they both became young girls.<br />
<br />
As they finally reached the age of 11, Jack managed to finally do something, “W-what the… Gracia, what happened?!” the moment the words left his mouth Jack blinked in surprised confusion. Greg didn’t seem to take notice of the other’s slip, to busy examining the clothes that now adorned ‘his’ body. At the moment, it was a rather simple school uniform; a tan blazer with a red cardigan and an uncomfortably short black skirt, the school board is obviously filled with perverted old men. At first surprised by the thought, Greg concluded that ‘he’ agreed. <br />
<br />
“Gra-I mean Greg!”<br />
<br />
Being shaken violently quickly got Gracia’s attention, “Sto-o-op, Jessica!” though the jostling also made her take note of another new addition, a pair of glasses which had been dislodged during her sister’s assault, leaving her effectively blind. Despite her frustration, Gracia couldn&#39;t help but think of how thankful she was that when she was in her magical girl form they ceased being necessary. Jessica finally relented, quickly grabbing Gracia’s fallen glasses while giggling nervously; Gracia was sure to chew her out for that one.<br />
<br />
Having her glasses once again placed on her face, the shorter girl looked up at her sister, “I don’t know, but let’s find a mirror, I want to make sure everything’s normal. I wouldn’t put it pass you to not mention some weird new addition.” Just as Jessica was about to let out a relieved breath, Gracia sent a withering glare back towards her sister, “We’ll discuss your method of getting my attention later.” The two girls headed to the bathroom and found that it was much larger than before and not just because they were smaller. Jessica hurried over to a full body mirror and started looking herself over, turning her body this way and that.<br />
<br />
“Well, I look like my awesome self, so all’s well that ends well.” She giggled as she noticed her sister’s unamused expression. With the mirror they were able to compare their faces. Despite different hair colors and body types, it was quite clear they were related, they had the exact same face; eyes, nose, mouth, even their ears looked the same. It was an adorable face, the kind high school girls squealed over and old woman wanted to pinch the cheeks of.<br />
<br />
“Ah, better check on our powers.”<br />
<br />
“I’m surprised you came to that conclusion, normally I have to badger you into doing anything sensible.”<br />
<br />
“And you’re a flat chested midget.”<br />
<br />
“J-Jessica!”<br />
<br />
The younger sister giggled uncontrollably as Gracia blushed a bright indignant crimson and folded her arms over her non-existent breasts.<br />
<br />
“Just hurry up and transform, you- you stupid muscle head!”<br />
<br />
Smiling, Jessica quickly snapped into her pose; legs spread, one hand held palm out above her head, the other held stiffly behind herself closed in a fist, “CHANGE!” White light burst forth enveloping the preteen, before forming a sort of ring about the girl and somehow creating a glittering background behind Jessica. Gracia knew from experience that the ‘background’ was always on the other side of her body, regardless of where the viewer stood. The world seemed to slow down, while Jessica sped up, but somehow were still going at the same pace. How this worked, Gracia had given up trying to understand, all that mattered was that the transformation always happened fast enough that if an attack hadn’t hit by the time either of them had finished saying the activation phrase, they’d finish changing before it connected, but the transformation always took the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
The clothes on Jessica vanished into sparkling motes of light leaving Her naked and yet not, yet another bizarre aspect of the ‘Transformation Sequence;’ regardless of where and how you were looking at one of them transforming, you could never see anything ‘private.’ Sometimes it was because of how their body was twisted others because some insubstantial thing was incidentally in the way.<br />
<br />
Starting with her metal boots and moving up, Jessica’s outfit began to materialize on her from flashes of silver and gold light. The finally was her sword, which started as a long glowing blob the seemed to come spinning from nowhere, slamming one end of itself into her open hand which reflexively closed on it. A bright flash of light accompanied each feature of her weapon as it formed from the blob, before finely erupting into a massive blast of black smoke as the large blade came into being. With her transformation finished the background vanished.<br />
<br />
Gracia looked her sister over, “You look alright, how do you feel?”<br />
<br />
“Other than the usual feeling of being able to kick some major butt, no, I feel just fine.”<br />
<br />
“Good.”<br />
<br />
“Well? Aren’t you gonna change?”<br />
<br />
“…right, better check as well.”<br />
<br />
Gracia’s took her pose which consisted of standing with her feet together, head slightly bowed, and hands held out in front of her a few inches apart from each other. “Now.” the actual phrase could be anything, they just had to focus correctly and speak a verbal command. As with her sister, Gracia gained her own background, though it consisted of dark, swirling colors. The actual change started with her clothes evaporating into black smoke, almost as if they unraveled as such. The rest was very similar to her sister’s transformation only clouds of black smoke replacing flashes of light, starting with her boots and ending with her hooded cloak.<br />
<br />
Her staff formed itself from the churning black smoke in between her hands; it swirled and condensed itself starting from the bottom and working its way up to the crystal which itself formed from a nova of light. As the crystal took form Gracia clasped her hands around it, fingers intertwined. With this final gesture, the background faded.<br />
<br />
“Anything wrong?”<br />
<br />
Gracia shook her head negative.<br />
<br />
“Alright then, about who was going to use the shower first; I’m pretty sure we can both fit in this thing together.” Jessica gestured towards the walk in shower that was quite capable of fitting two adults; they wouldn&#39;t have any trouble at all.<br />
<br />
Suddenly becoming nervous, Gracia shook her head as she changed back to her civilian form, which consisted a cloud of black smoke surrounding her before disappearing. “Um, you can go first. I-I have homework I need to finish.” Upon giving her excuse, she immediately tried to slink from the bathroom. Only for her sister’s iron grip to grab the back of her uniform’s neck.<br />
<br />
“I know you got all of your homework done before we came on this little trip. Come on, it’ll be fun. It’s not like were old dudes or something.”<br />
<br />
Wincing at Jessica’s reference to what she was rapidly coming to think of as a past life, the smaller girl struggled valiantly against her tormenter. “Let me go! How dare you manhandle your older sister like this!”<br />
<br />
Jessica’s victory was assured once she managed to wrap her arms around Gracia in a mighty hug, pinning her arms to her side. She giggled as she rested her chin on top of her ‘big sister’s’ head. “Please, Gracia? Pretty please?”<br />
<br />
“No!”<br />
<br />
“Ah come on, we used to do it all the time.”<br />
<br />
“We’re too old for that sort of thing.”<br />
<br />
“We’re still kids.”<br />
<br />
“…..” Gracia grumbled<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Fine! I’ll take a shower with you!”</p>
