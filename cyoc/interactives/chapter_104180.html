<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frieda Knight was about to merge with the oncoming hallway traffic to head for her after Freshman lunch study hall, when someone yanked her into the girls’ bathroom.<br />
When Frieda turned around to see what was going on, she found herself face to face with a visibly annoyed Julie Stovall.<br />
&quot;Just what the fuck do you think you were doing, talking to Eric Anderson?&quot; Julie demanded to know, even as she pushed Frieda against the tiled bathroom wall.<br />
&quot;First off, I don&#39;t care who the hell you are,&quot; growled Frieda, barely able to keep her werepanthress under control. &quot;Keep your damn fins off of me or the cafeteria will be serving sushi tomorrow!&quot; she shouted, batting Julie&#39;s hands off of her.<br />
Shocked, Julie took a step back as Frieda continued. &quot;Now then, don&#39;t you remember the chapters on World War 2 from History class? I&#39;m your mole,&quot; she said, thinking quickly.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; asked a confused Julie.<br />
<i>And to think, until now I thought the dumb blonde jokes were just cliche,</i> thought Frieda as she added, &quot;I pretend to be Eric and Spencer&#39;s friend, all the while keeping an eye on them for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; said Julie with a smile, realizing what Frieda was up to. &quot;Good idea.&quot; <i>Glad I thought of it.</i> &quot;Did you learn anything important?&quot;<br />
&quot;Only that Eric&#39;s confused over what to think about things now concerning you,&quot; replied Frieda, which was the truth.<br />
&quot;Good. Eric surprised me finding another girl so soon because I didn&#39;t think he had it in him, so I&#39;ll have to adjust my plans accordingly, but eventually my ultimate goal of revenge will be mine.&quot;<br />
&quot;And how will you accomplish that?&quot; <i>You&#39;re still grounded for the rest of the calendar year,</i> Frieda reminded herself.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to play this by ear for now and take my opportunities when I can, but when Eric and Spencer break up...&quot; began Julie, then the bell rang, signalling that not only was Sophomore lunch starting, but that all the Freshman not already in their respective study halls were now late.<br />
&quot;DAMN!&quot; said Frieda and Julie practically at the same time, just before Stovall rushed out of the bathroom to head for her destination.<br />
Before Frieda Knight left the bathroom, she did a quick search to make sure that she and Julie were the only ones in there, which they were, before heading off to her own study hall because she didn&#39;t want the lie she told Julie to get back to Eric and Spencer.<br />
<i>Whether you know it or not Julie Stovall, we&#39;re through bitch,</i> vowed Frieda, leaving the girl&#39;s bathroom herself. <i>I may wind up being a mole, but I&#39;m Eric and Spencer&#39;s against you now! NO ONE shoves me around and gets away with it,</i> she swore, entering her study hall and apologizing to the teacher for being late because of &quot;female problems&quot;, which wasn&#39;t a total lie.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Sir, a lady who says she&#39;s your wife is on Line Two,&quot; the soldier answering the phones told Evan Lawson.<br />
&quot;Put her through,&quot; said the Navy SEAL, picking up the extension.<br />
&quot;Hi honey. I haven&#39;t got much time but I need to run something past you right quick,&quot; said Maggie Lawson.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I got a text message from Spencer earlier, saying Julie Stovall is mad as hell at them and is now trying to break Spencer and Eric Anderson up.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Evan in disbelief.<br />
&quot;That was my first thought too. I don&#39;t have the whole story, but Sophomore lunch just started at the high school and Spencer is expecting me to call her with advice, so I was thinking...&quot; before she told her husband her ideas.<br />
&quot;Considering where she is and who she&#39;s dealing with, that sounds pretty good,&quot; admitted Evan, after listening to his wife. &quot;In fact, I&#39;m working on something for the Mayor right now because that damn FBI agent Scott Walker has been nosing around Moon Lake again trying to find out its secret.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; exclaimed Maggie.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve already got an idea how to take care of Walker, but maybe I can work out a deal with the Mayor to get his daughter to back down from Eric and Spencer too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Should I tell her?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Just stick to what you already have, because I haven&#39;t run my idea about deterring Walker past the Mayor yet. Otherwise, since you&#39;re on a deadline, is there anything else?&quot; asked Evan.<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;ll see you when you get home tonight. Hope everything works out for the best,&quot; said Maggie.<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; replied Evan, before hanging up.<br />
<br />
A couple of minutes later, Evan secured an outside line and called the Mayor&#39;s office. Mayor Martin Stovall answered the phone personally on the second ring.<br />
&quot;Your honor? Evan Lawson. I think I have a viable idea. Still trying to work out the logistics on my end, but we&#39;d need the cooperation of your office to pull it off anyway. What if we let Scott Walker discover the secret of Moon Lake, but the secret WE want him to know and NOT the real secret?&quot;<br />
The Mayor thought about it for a moment and then said, &quot;Misinformation, huh? I like it, but what would this alternate find be?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s part of the logistics I haven&#39;t worked out yet, but the idea is that once Walker discovers the fake secret, if he doesn&#39;t keep it, we can easily disprove his findings and discredit him. Then that should get him off of everyone&#39;s backs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Great idea!&quot;<br />
&quot;However, there are a couple of things we&#39;d need from you right off the bat,&quot; added Evan.<br />
&quot;Like?&quot; wondered the Mayor.<br />
&quot;An abandoned and isolated building that still has working utilities. Somewhere accessible but out of the way of civilians and other innocents.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have to do a bit of research, but I&#39;m sure we can find something either within the town limits or right on the outskirts. Anything else?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still going over things on my end to see what there is among the declassified, surplus, and decommissioned materials we can use; but besides the town&#39;s full cooperation when the time comes, there is one other thing I can think of off the top of my head.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
Evan paused before saying, &quot;I need you to tell your daughter to leave my daughter and Eric Anderson alone, no matter what.&quot;<br />
&quot;What does Julie have to do with anything?&quot; asked Martin Stovall, as Evan thought he heard a slight groan in the background.<br />
&quot;I just got a report from Moon Lake High that Julie Stovall is planning something to break up Spencer and Eric in hopes of achieving some kind of revenge goal. I have absolutely no idea why she is mad at my daughter, and Eric broke up with Julie because she was cheating on him.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said the Mayor, with a bit of a more obvious moan now.<br />
&quot;Well, I feel that whatever happens between Eric and Spencer, they deserve their shot at happiness without any outside interference, even from an unhappy ex.&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; replied the Mayor, as Evan&#39;s acute werewolf hearing detected another groan in the background.<br />
&quot;Are you all right sir?&quot;<br />
&quot;Stomach problems. It&#39;s been a pretty hectic day around here already,&quot; was Martin Stovall&#39;s reply. &quot;How soon do you think it will be before you have your plan in action?&quot;<br />
&quot;Depending upon the logistics, within a week,&quot; estimated Evan. &quot;Besides, knowing what I do about the FBI, they&#39;ll keep a tight rein on Walker for the foreseeable future, so it will be at least a month before he can attempt going off the reservation and striking out for Moon Lake on his own again; unless something comes up between now and then that warrants an official FBI presence.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, here&#39;s hoping it don&#39;t. I won&#39;t be able to talk to Julie until I get home from work tonight, but consider it done. Whether or not she actually heeds me remains to be seen though. She can be as headstrong as her mother sometimes,&quot; warned Martin. <i>Besides, I can&#39;t watch her 24/7, I&#39;ve got my own problems to deal with,</i> he thought, while trying to suppress another moan.<br />
&quot;Understood. Meanwhile, I&#39;ll call you back within a day or two when things are more solid on my end,&quot; promised Evan.<br />
&quot;Good. Looking forward to hearing from and working with you,&quot; said the Mayor.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed Evan, before both men concluded the call.<br />
<br />
BACK IN THE MAYOR&#39;S OFFICE...<br />
Martin Stovall leaned back in his office chair as Alyssa Cooper crawled out from underneath his desk.<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve missed my talents Marty,&quot; she teased, while licking the fresh male cum off her lips.<br />
Everything about their meeting had been totally business like in regards to renewing the town&#39;s construction contracts with the firm she represented, until Evan Lawson&#39;s phone call.<br />
Then, distracted talking to the Navy SEAL trying to help protect Moon Lake, the sexy were-mermaid had crawled under Martin&#39;s desk, unzipped his pants, and proceeded to remind him just how good she was at giving sexual pleasures.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not looking for any kind of relationship that involves either a ring or some other form of long term commitment, because I&#39;m far from ready to settle down; but surely there must be a way we can still hook up every once in a while for some fun like we used to,&quot; Alyssa asked in a very seductive tone of voice, even as she raised her skirt and sat down in Martin&#39;s lap without bothering to zip his pants back up. &quot;If we do get back together, you won&#39;t have to worry about any unwanted guppies either. I plan to stay on my were-mermaid birth control pills for a mighty long time, because I&#39;m having too much fun in life as it is,&quot; she added, giving him a quick kiss.<br />
As his cock began to stiffen again between her thighs, Martin quickly realized Alyssa wasn&#39;t wearing any panties, as the head of his penis began drifting in-between the moist, wet folds of her vagina.<br />
His former paramour unbuttoned her feminine business suit jacket just enough to pull a breast out from beneath the material. The fact that she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra either was a moot point as Alyssa began gently running the hard nipple across his lips, even as Martin began to give serious thought to her suggestion of hooking back up again for more extramarital sex.</p>
