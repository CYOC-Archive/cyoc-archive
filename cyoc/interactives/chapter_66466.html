<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kylie moaned softly in her sleep. It was not a moan of fear or discomfort but one of pleasure. She was <br />
dreaming a most wonderful dream, though it was strange and surreal at the same time. And something about it <br />
felt familiar, like deja vu...<br />
<br />
She was back in the halls of Glendale High and dressed all in black. There were Halloween decorations up along <br />
the walls and doors - tacky bats and witch cut-outs, plastic pumpkins and cotton webs. She could see some <br />
people up ahead and calmly walked toward them feeling confident and strangely powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; she called out to them as she approached and they turned. There was a scrawny boy dressed in a shabby <br />
muscle suit as a strongman and a girl with strap-on wings that glittered and bobbing pom-pom antennae from her <br />
headband. She was a butterfly. Their eyes widened as they saw her. Kylie simply looked at them, and watched.<br />
<br />
The boy was first. Sweat broke out across his brow as he grunted in surprised discomfort. He stared as a <br />
meager 5'3&quot; but began to grow, gaining height at a rapid pace. Soon he was over 6' tall and looking down at <br />
his friend in surprise and himself in wonder. His muscle suit was strained against his stretched torso and <br />
lengthened arms, his tiny spandex speedo similarly stretched. His feet were painfully trapped in his now too <br />
small boots. He bent to pull them off.<br />
<br />
Instead his fingers ripped through the leather as they swelled with sudden muscle. It rippled up his arms, his <br />
scrawny frame now doubling in size as he gained mass and chiseled physique. His legs bulged with muscle as did <br />
his feet, now free and shredding any lingering, clinging material from his footwear. The muscle suit ripped <br />
and fell from his body as it was replaced with the real thing, shiny with his perspiration. The boy ran his <br />
large hands over his body in obvious delight having now attained a body he had long been jealous of. But his <br />
expression changed to shock and horror as his hands reached his pecs and they began to push outward. The <br />
nipples were dark and tight, poking into his palms as the flesh behind them swelled. Two large, muscular <br />
breasts now adorned his chest and he felt the weight of them.<br />
<br />
Quickly he reached down to his stretched speedo. His face betrayed what he found: nothing long and rigid. <br />
Instead he felt the hot, fleshy folds of a new vagina that was swollen with heat and arousal, making quite the <br />
camel toe. The new girl's face softened only slightly and she kept the short haircut. The tall, Amazonian <br />
woman grunted as intelligence faded from  her eyes and she proceeded to rub her moistening crotch and grin <br />
stupidly in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Beside her the butterfly girl was shivering. Her eyes were pointed down at the ground and her feet in their <br />
curly green shoes that were part of her costume. She didn't really care about the ground, though, or her <br />
shoes. But her feet... She needed to see them, to... taste them.<br />
<br />
Her moan was wordless as she sat on the ground and tugged her boots off. Her growl was low as she tore through <br />
the nylons covering her legs and freed her sweaty feet from their confines. They were beautiful to her, and <br />
sexy. She leaned towards them, her spine much more flexible than it was moments before, and sniffed along the <br />
arch of her left foot, inhaling deeply. Her eyes fluttered. Tentatively, some resistance still struggling <br />
against the desires consuming her, she brought out her tongue and licked her sole. The taste of her foot <br />
exploded across her tongue. The girl's eyes rolled back in her head. She didn't care, she needed them, needed <br />
them now!<br />
<br />
With a grunt the girl forcefully grabbed her right foot and twisted her leg until it lined up with her crotch. <br />
Then with a quick thrust she shoved it under her sparkly skirt and into her sodden snatch, burying it as <br />
deeply as she could through her panties. She wiggled her toes and shuddered at the sensation. Then she licked <br />
her lips as drool trickled from the corner of her mouth. She opened her mouth. Her jaw unhinged. With a wet <br />
slurp she sucked her entire left foot into her mouth and began to suck and run her tongue along its length and <br />
between her toes. Her body shook with an orgasm and her nostrils flared as she sucked in breath after breath <br />
through her nose.<br />
<br />
Kylie watched all of this with a feeling of wicked satisfaction. They deserved it. She sensed others in the <br />
school changing, their bodies twisting and morphing by the command of her will. They deserved it, too; they <br />
all did! She would punish everyone who had ever been mean to her, who had ever tormented her, who had ever <br />
watched as she suffered day after day.<br />
<br />
But wait... she hadn't suffered, had she? Kylie remembered having a wonderful time in high school. She was <br />
liked, popular. She was beautiful and kind, she gave back to the school, she had great friends and an even <br />
better boyfriend, Tyler. Didn't she?<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a lie,&quot; whispered a voice.<br />
<br />
Kylie looked up. She was in a bathroom, a men's bathroom since there were urinals lining the wall. She stood <br />
in front of a mirror. The reflection was hers but... it was different. It was a guy, a guy who looked like <br />
her. Or did she look like the guy?<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't always popular and loved. You used to be picked on, looked down on. You were the butt of their <br />
jokes. Hardly anyone gave you the time of day,&quot; the image sneered. &quot;You used to be me, until the town curse <br />
changed you into a woman. But you had the power to take revenge until it was stolen from you, locked in your <br />
memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie shook her head. &quot;I don't understand, I don't know what you're talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
The image smiled. &quot;Yes you do, Kylie. You know it deep down. But you're fighting it, hiding from the truth. <br />
It's okay. You'll give in eventually.&quot; He seemed to lean closer. &quot;And until you do, don't worry. You have me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughter filled the bathroom and the dream faded. Kylie woke to an intense, shuddering orgasm that left her <br />
flush and her pajama bottoms sticky with her juices. The memory of the dream was fading. She couldn't remember <br />
what it was about, exactly, but she was left with a feeling that something good was going to happen, and soon.  <br />
Judging from how she felt, she was going to love it.</p>
