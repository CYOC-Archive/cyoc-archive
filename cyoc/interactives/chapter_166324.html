<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner seemed mostly normal aside from being perceived through Mike&#39;s eyes, Jeff could only barely tell that Jacob seemed a little shorter and that was because he was looking for it. Jeff and John weren&#39;t on speaking terms. Jeff rightfully feared that if he became annoying Mike could destroy his personality with an instantaneous snap of his thumb against Jeff&#39;s elastic band.<br />
<br />
Mike assisted Jacob with his homework but mostly just gave the answers, not much sense in making sure he learns when he will be regressing a few more years tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that...<br />
<br />
Jeff felt an overwhelming sense of hopelessness wash over him. He was completely powerless and betrayed by someone he loved, forced to commit sexual acts against his will. Jeff had lost the fire he originally had and had spent hours racking his brain to find no other solutions and near the end of Jacob&#39;s fractions he just broke down. Jeff began bawling from the mental prison he was locked in and ready to ejaculate because it was the only function his body now served. Mike excused himself from the homework and told Jacob he did a good job and that was enough. Jake&#39;s younger body was more easily tired and circles were beginning to form under his eyes.<br />
<br />
Mike was physically exhausted from the day too, it was more physically active than he had been for years, despite becoming younger. He was also emotionally exhausted from sifting through not only his thoughts but Jeff&#39;s and navigating the minefields of his emotions and challenging conversations. On top of all this, some part of him would miss his sons and wife, but he does want Marc, so the sudden confusion and uncertainty has been making him want nothing more than to sleep on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jacob, You look tired, you have a rough day?&quot; Jacob nodded while packing his book bag. &quot;Me too, you think you wanna go to bed early?&quot; Jacob silently nodded his head and plodded upstairs to brush his teeth. &quot;Me too.&quot; Mike walked to his wife in the living room, &quot;Hey Hun, I&#39;m bushed, I&#39;m going to crash early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you feeling alright dear?&quot; she asked surprised. &quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t sleep well last night and spent all day running around and trying to figure some intense stuff out...&quot; She nodded in understanding and tried to hide her excitement &quot;Oh, Alright then. I guess I&#39;ll just catch up on some of my shows then. Promise to keep it down.&quot; Mike smiled. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike grabbed his work laptop and set it on his nightstand as he went to brush his teeth, he could hear Jacob already doing the same. Jeff was still blubbering in the background and it was hard for Mike to chide him because he could feel exactly how betrayed, confused, and hopeless Jeff felt which only added to Mike&#39;s overall confusion...<br />
<br />
Mike wanted this to be something special they shared before everyone gets to be happy. This is supposed to be his last memories of his family before he quietly steps aside, and Jeff is ruining it. Although the thought of being with someone from Marc&#39;s family was enticing, deep down, he loved his children and overwriting Jeff&#39;s whole personality, even temporarily, did feel like he was crossing some sort of line he wasn&#39;t ready to cross.  <br />
<br />
Mike spat out the toothpaste and rinsed his mouth. Retrieving the laptop he opened the program and deactivated the personality overwrite just leaving the reality reset capability. He didn&#39;t hide this from Jeff and asked Jeff to look, the mental sobbing slowed down and Jeff&#39;s mind began to race with questions though Jeff didn&#39;t actually say anything.  Mike peeked in on Jacob who was already fast asleep, no doubt suddenly back in the middle of a growth spurt.<br />
<br />
Mike went back to his PC and for the first time since dinner addressed Jeff again. &quot;Look, I&#39;m going to remember you even after you forget me and I want as much time with you as I can get. I want to spend all this time with you, I was reminded of that after I remembered Jacob being born. You were my first child, and I want you to grow into a strong capable man, able to raise a family of his own.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff was just done, his mind had been used as a contingency plan generator all day and he knew this was coming with some kind of catch. If not, his dad would have turned him back to... whatever age he was supposed to be, by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your first thought was right, we just need to transition faster till we get out of this in between phase. It&#39;s better to keep you as yourself for a short period, than to lose you altogether for a long period. I also think we both need to actually be able to rest tonight.&quot; With that Mike set their libido while under bedding to be normal levels and set both he and Jeff to sleep deeply, then Mike went into his settings and marked that he has 12 distinct orgasms after he climaxes. Because he and Jeff are linked, Jeff will share in the experience with him giving them approximately 2 minutes of bliss... <br />
<br />
&quot;But Dad, that would make us shift a year at a time.&quot; Jeff felt a sinking fear roll over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, we will just need a couple times tonight, then a few times tomorrow morning, and I can reset reality again before Jacob or your mom wake up, changing the transition speed back so we can enjoy our time together. You&#39;ll be calling me bro and won&#39;t be able to help but crave your former mother as a wife.&quot; Mike double checked the settings for Jacob to make sure he can&#39;t regress below 1, and saved the edits.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sick. Look Dad, I&#39;m happy you realize deleting my personality is wro...&quot; Mike repositioned Jeff as he set the open laptop on the nightstand, suffering blue balls himself from an evening of abstinence. This immediately reduced their focus to nothing more than physical fulfillment. Within just a few seconds they jointly reached climax and the next two minutes were a roller coaster of ecstasy. They worked together to get off a second time before Jeff could stop himself and while in the throws of multiple orgasm Mike crawled under the covers,<br />
<br />
As they finished feeling the afterglow both of them were able to suddenly relax as the ever present lust they had felt all day finally subsided. Mike fell asleep within a few deep breaths and Jeff fell asleep shortly after.<br />
<br />
Jeff awoke just a few hours later, Not having a body to maintain or repair meant the only need he had for sleep was for his mental state. He could hear his mom breathing next to him and could feel his body breathing slowly, he realized he was beginning to feel slightly uncomfortable in this position, so he repositioned and considered getting up before he realized... he had moved his dad&#39;s body...<br />
<br />
Gently Jeff reached over to the nightstand and pressed a key waking his father&#39;s discarded laptop. The light came on but his fathers breathing didn&#39;t change. He quickly found his profile and saw there was a &quot;kinky roleplay&quot; template applied to him with a button that offered to reverse roles with user. Immediately he clicked it only to find a screen outlying the changes. Mike to sentient, always clean underwear with the optional fabric genitals, Jeff to human. Jeff didn&#39;t see any of the other settings and guessed they were tied to his and his dad&#39;s profiles directly.<br />
<br />
Without hesitating Jeff clicked save and closed his dad&#39;s eyes hoping that his awareness wouldn&#39;t take back over or stop the process. The computer beeped, Mom stirred, &quot;Why are you on your computer? Its the middle of the night.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Hun&quot; Jeff mouthed as his dad was exhaling making a convincing sleep workaholic. Jeff suddenly lost connection with his dad&#39;s arm which fell to the floor with a heavy thud. Jeff lie there waiting to know what will happen as his consciousness was pulled back down into the underwear. <br />
<br />
Dad&#39;s breathing changed sharply and Jeff could see again, Dad had opened his eyes... Mike reached up and closed the lid to the laptop making the room go dark. He slid out of bed groggily and made his way to the main bathroom to avoid disturbing his wife.<br />
<br />
As soon as they left the covers their libidos sparked to life. Mike quickly whipped his cock out trying to pee before an erection made it impossible. Dads eyes were shut, the bathroom was bright, blindingly so compared to the dark hallway. Without windows, the only options were blinding or complete blackness.<br />
<br />
Jeff still didn&#39;t have control over his dad but was beginning to feel more sensations than just a penis. <br />
<br />
Mike finished peeing and flushed the toilet. As his eyes were now mostly acclimated to the light he examined his face and hair adoring the rapid reduction in gray hairs and wrinkles. A flair of lust flushed his cheeks as Mike realized he would love to watch as the year melted off of him. From the corner of his eye he noticed blue on his chest. Taken aback he leaned away from the mirror.<br />
<br />
He immediately noticed the blue was coming from Jeff, his boxers. He knew he needed to get back to the Chronivac but it was at that moment Jeff had formed legs and feet that reached the floor. Jeff filled with the insatiable power of transformation driven lust, penetrated Mike with vigor sending him bending over the bathroom sink. the blue streaks on Mike&#39;s chest took on definition becoming hands and arms and Jeff caressed Mike&#39;s chest as his torso began to grow. <br />
<br />
Jeff was a large blue humanoid form and as the moments passed his skin became flesh. Mike looked into the mirror as Jeff pounded away vigorously but neither of them could reach orgasm. &quot;What am I doing wrong?&quot; Jeff asked in a frustrated whisper. &quot;Nothing, but I have an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike pushed Jeff a step back and neither noticed as the remnants of the underwear tor away effortlessly and were absorbed into Jeff&#39;s masculine 23 year old body. Mike turned and kneeled taking Jeff&#39;s penis into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t do anything as his fathers body began to warp itself around him just as Mike couldn&#39;t do anything to stop himself. Mike&#39;s arms came up under his crotch wrapped around front and merged together around Jeff&#39;s waist. Immediately his arms began to flatten and Mikes body began rapidly shrinking. Mike was soon pulled from kneeling back to standing position and shortly after that he was dangling while continuing to dwindle. The inside of Mike&#39;s mouth began to take on a texture of soft fabric and Mike&#39;s lower body curled up underneath Jeff causing him to take a partial squatting position. Mike&#39;s legs curled up and forward merging with the parts of his arms forming an elastic band.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s movements were getting weaker now but Jeff took over moving Mike&#39;s face to continue stimulation. The final changes happened rapidly. Mike&#39;s face and body flattened, became a solid piece of cloth, and turned blue. Finally Mikes penis twisted 180 degrees and firmly inserted itself into Jeff&#39;s butt, shocking and horrifying Jeff but immediately triggering the 2 minute orgasm cycle and aging Jeff to 24 years old.<br />
<br />
Jeff was now in control. He sneaked back into his parents room and grabbed Mike&#39;s laptop before taking it into his bedroom. He pulled the program back up and checked the telepathy settings instantly finding what went wrong. The setting was made to allow visual data to pass, but more or less could pass based on the will of the wearer... setting himself to sleep very deeply turned off enough will to allow repositioning and moving of a hand... Jeff corrected this oversight by limiting the maximum access the underwear could have.<br />
<br />
Jeff then curled up on his bed and went back to sleep knowing he had a lot of work in front of him.</p>
