<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen selected the Soccer captain option and blacked out.<br />
<br />
Stephen looked up at the ceiling. He knew he was on the ground. His former house had a white painted ceiling while this one was beige. He lifted his head up higher and looked down at his body. He had a fully formed eight pack and a projected set of pecs. For some reason he was laying down on the carpet. He looked around the room.<br />
<br />
There was one beige walk the rest were all brick. He say two desks on one side of the room and two beds in the other. Cloths littered the floor and there was a certain smell to the room. Stephen presumed that he was in a college dorm room. He walked over to the mirror hanging on the door to check himself out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He was about 5&#39;9 with rich chocolate brown hair covered by a baseball hat. He looked to be about 19 or 20. Stephen flexed his biceps and internally giggled as his arms rose in prominence. Stephen flexed his muscular calfs and biceps and took it that he was clean shaven in his pits and on his legs. Stephen felt groggy all of the sudden and fell back down on the floor. <br />
<br />
Stephen woke to the sound of someone knocking on the door. He opened to find a tall 6&#39;11 man with even larger muscles than him. He had short curly blonde hair and electric blue eyes. He still had to look up at this man but his smile showed boyish innocence. <br />
<br />
&quot; Hey Jason are you gonna let me inside?&quot;<br />
Stephen was confused by the man&#39;s address to him. Jason? Jason Blair? Jason Mathew Blair that was his full name. Stephen was sure of it now. In his confusion Stephen realized he was still blocking the doorway. He stepped aside and let him in. <br />
&quot; So Did you sleep off hangover from the other night?<br />
&quot;Yes I did actually Luke. Did you sleep it off as well?&quot; Jason asked not knowing he already knew Luke&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
&quot; what you don&#39;t remember? You must have been drinking a lot to not remember what happened. We both had stuff to drink but I rarely if ever get drunk so I was still pretty sober. You were so drunk I carried you out of the bar. We then went to my car and made out for a while. You had a very peculiar attraction to my nipples this time I still have the hichies. &quot;<br />
<br />
Jason was confused he knew he had a girlfriend named Olivia. But yet he was still attracted to Luke. <br />
<br />
Luke pulled up his shirt to revel his chiseled pecs and washboard abs. And just like Luke had told him there were a dark red marks on each of his perky tan nipples. Right above his pec was a tattoo. The writing was an entire stanza of Latin verses that Jason couldn&#39;t decipher.<br />
<br />
&quot; I guess I was thinking I was face down in Olivia&#39;s tits I guess.&quot;<br />
Luke laughed at that and took off his shoes and socks and then his shorts. Till it was just him in his white underwear. Luke saw him checking him out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you want to be buried in these again.&quot; He said as he flexed his pectorals again. <br />
&quot; yes!&quot; Jason showed out as he lept onto Luke sucking his face and running his hands through his hair. As they were making out Luke undid Jason&#39;s shorts and through them away. He reached down under Jason&#39;s compression shorts and grabbed a piece of his ass. Jason knew exactly what to do he started to pleasure Luke. He felt his big muscles, he kissed him everywhere and Luke liked a little rough so Jason bite Luke on the ear and  sucked in his nipples to leave a distance feel of pain. Luke Ended up ripping Jason&#39;s underwear but he didn&#39;t care he loved Luke.<br />
Luke lifted up Jason like he weighed nothing and carried him to the bed. Luke got on top of Jason and flipped him over. Jason had already undid his underwear so KNOW if was only a matter of time. His huge cock teased Jason&#39;s hole dribbling pre. Jason was in ecstasy. He wished Luke would shove it in already but loved the act behind this. Luke finally went in balls deep and with each powerful thrust coming from Luke&#39;s body Jason&#39;s would be moved as well. Jason remembered that Luke likes to here sounds of pleasure as he is fucking. So Jason made yelps of pain and desire. Luke came and his load all the way up his ass. Jason felt is butt was internally squishy but he loved it. <br />
<br />
After two hours of rounds. Jason rested exhausted on Luke&#39;s much bigger chest curled up in his arms. Jason loved him so much. He knew that he was bi sexual but he still preferred guys more. Olivia was more like and act. The coach didn&#39;t want a gay man to be captain of the team so Jason dated Olivia to hide the secret. Olivia didn&#39;t know anything about his obsession with men. He crawled up Luke&#39;s chiseled chest and placed a light kiss on his lips. <br />
<br />
&quot; Luke come shower with me&quot; Jason pleaded.<br />
&quot; Fine okay Luke said as he picked Jason up like a doll and marched over to their bathroom. Jason felt deeply in love with this man. He loved him truly and he never wanted to let go. He moved his way down onto Luke&#39;s Monster cock and started to suck away.</p>
