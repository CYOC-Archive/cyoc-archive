<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Say, Chloe, you mind if I borrow that Cone of Fitting for a little bit?&quot; asked Charlee, who was already starting to shift into a werehyena.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s come?&quot; asked Chloe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since I took Samantha&#39;s chance to join the pack today, I owe her big time. And, well, I&#39;m not sure if she can handle my cock,&quot; said Charlee.<br />
<br />
Samantha opened her mouth to protest but then she took another look at the monster between Charlee&#39;s legs. &quot;You might have a point there,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s plenty fair,&quot; said Chloe, &quot;But don&#39;t keep it to yourselves the whole party. There are others who are wanting to try it. And that goes for the earrings too. We want to keep them circulating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Asha thought about that for a moment. Hir geis kept her from having sex with someone else. Specifically, no one else can touch hir with sex in mind. But the earrings would let hir feel the sex without any actual touching. That doesn&#39;t break the rules of the geis, does it? However, shi couldn&#39;t just take one considering how much attention would be focused on them and it would become clear to the other wearer if shi put an earring on. So Asha was going to have to do something that was almost against hir nature: asking politely.<br />
<br />
Asha cleared hir throat and asked, &quot;Uh, would it be ok if I got to wear one of those earrings for a little bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kibibi glared at her and said, &quot;You&#39;re still under a geis, young lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I won&#39;t be touching anyone,&quot; said Asha, &quot;I&#39;d just be feeling the same thing as them. Come on, you guys are about to have all kinds of sexy fun and I don&#39;t get a taste? That&#39;s really unfair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And aging yourself to maturity was a right thing?&quot; snapped Kibibi.<br />
<br />
Chloe was a little more softhearted than that. She didn&#39;t want anyone being unhappy at her party, even unexpected guests. &quot;I don&#39;t think it would be bad if shi got a small sample,&quot; said Chloe.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is none of your business,&quot; snapped Kibibi, &quot;The leaders of the pack decide these matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, Selena glared and said, &quot;And in case you&#39;re forgetting already, <i>I&#39;m</i> the leader here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kibibi looked like she was going to protest for a moment before collecting herself. &quot;Right, my apologies,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I don&#39;t want to get Asha&#39;s hopes up, so I&#39;m just going to check with Morgana to see if that little loophole would work,&quot; said Selena. She got her phone and said, &quot;Kibibi, Asanti, you better come with me. You have a right to hear this out too.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, they walked to another room and Selena called Morgana, putting her phone on speaker. Morgana presently answered. &quot;Selena, is the party going ok? I was just finishing up the testicle-restoration potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Abbie will be glad to hear that,&quot; said Selena.<br />
<br />
Kibibi sighed and said, &quot;And I suppose Enzi will be coming soon for hir treatment. Not looking forward to meeting hir again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You clawed off hir testicles, you do at least owe hir an apology,&quot; said Asanti.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve been thinking about that,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;I may have a solution that will satisfy restitution for all parties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; asked Selena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not sure if such a thing already exists in werehyena law, but when a werehyena castrates another, they would owe more than an apology, assuming the injured one wasn&#39;t doing something like trying to murder someone or stage a coup or something like that. After the castrated one is restore, then the one who did the castrating must then bear hir cub.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; snapped Kibibi.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not suggesting I give up my mate, are you?&quot; asked Asanti.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;But Kibibi will have to carry Enzi&#39;s cub and relinquish it to hir after she&#39;s born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s absurd!&quot; snapped Kibibi, &quot;I&#39;m the daughter of an alpha! I&#39;m meant to sire, not bear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still took hir masculinity,&quot; said Selena, &quot;That&#39;s a pretty serious thing among werehyenas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; said Asanti, &quot;And it would certainly be a case of the punishment fitting the crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You too?&quot; asked Kibibi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kibibi, your sire had to basically exile you for that. In older time, you would have been castrated in punishment. Spending 9 months carrying Enzi&#39;s child is a pretty light sentence compared to that,&quot; said Asanti.<br />
<br />
Selena did see the reason behind this. Of course, she could also think of an ulterior reason to support this. If Kibibi is pregnant, she wouldn&#39;t be able to start as many fights and perhaps motherhood would soften her a little. While a Lady of War should be hardcore, too much hardness also meant brittleness. And Selena would have a much easier time building up her unorthodox werehyena pack if Kibibi were just a little more flexible. &quot;Of course, we&#39;ll have to see if Enzi and Alpha Zuri agree if this is fair,&quot; said Selena, &quot;And we&#39;ll have to run this by Abbie and Riley as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kibibi wasn&#39;t too fond of the idea of being bred by Enzi. &quot;It might not really work anyways,&quot; she said, &quot;Even werehyenas aren&#39;t always lucky when it comes to mating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but Enzi and Abbie would have newly-restored testicles freshly imbibed by tanuki magic,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;That would make their sperm particularly potent for a while. Even if you and Riley weren&#39;t in estrus, you would almost certainly be impregnated by them while the magic&#39;s still fresh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kibibi frowned. She did owe Enzi big, but this was pretty big. But then, her sire may declare the whole idea absurd and nip it in the bud. &quot;We shall see what they say,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So anyways, I&#39;m assuming you didn&#39;t call about that,&quot; said Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, we just want to run something by you,&quot; said Selena. She told Morgana about potentially letting Asha wear one of the earrings without joining the orgy herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...well, technically that isn&#39;t against the geis, but you might have to test it yourself to see if she recoils. Though be careful, a trickster like her would look for any possible loophole to get out her geis,&quot; said Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything that would break her geis?&quot; asked Selena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, an iron will can eventually wear down the geis with time,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;There are some artifacts and spells that could break a geis. A more powerful being than Vivi could break it if they were so inclined. And there&#39;s always the true love clause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The what?&quot; asked Asanti.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if Asha were to truly fall in love with someone and they also loved her back, both knowing who and what the other one truly are, then that would break the spell,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;It&#39;s a pretty standard clause in spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena thought it over and said, &quot;If Asha really does fall in love and break the geis, then I think she would have earned the right to have sex. However, we won&#39;t tell her about that clause. If she&#39;s just wants to fall in love with someone so she can be free to have sex, then I wouldn&#39;t count that as true love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Asanti thought it over and said, &quot;That seems fair. She would have to really mature in order to fall in love like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d probably take years anyways,&quot; said Kibibi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until then, I think we can at least see if the earring would work for her,&quot; said Selena, &quot;Though she&#39;ll only get to have one turn with it before she has to leave the pool.&quot; With that, the three of them returned to run this small experiment.</p>
