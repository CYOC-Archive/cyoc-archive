<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I tried and tried dad. I can't get it to work. Bobby hadn't really tried but he told his dad he had.<br />
<br />
Give me the book.<br />
<br />
No. It's mine.<br />
<br />
GIVE ME THE BOOK NOW!<br />
<br />
Bobby being dad now was able to keep it from his dad.<br />
<br />
It's mine and I am going to keep it.<br />
<br />
If you don't change me back now you are going to be in trouble.<br />
<br />
Dad shouldn't have said that.<br />
<br />
OH! Come here daddy.<br />
<br />
Bobby sat down on the bed and as his dad came to pic up the book Bobby took his dad by the arm and twisted him <br />
around and pulled him over his knee. In moments that big paw of his came wacking down on his dad's butt. Over <br />
and over again until it was quite red and his dad was finally crying. Now don't sas me dad.<br />
<br />
You will give me the book NOW.<br />
<br />
Go to bed.<br />
<br />
Bobby took his dad and put him in his room and locked the door. Now think about what you have done Bobby said <br />
laughing to himself.<br />
<br />
Bobby took his dad's car and looking somewhat drunk took off. Bobby had never driven before and he wasn't the <br />
best at it but he found his way to a bar. That was what daddies do wasn't it. He went in and flashed his dad's <br />
drivers licence and went in and got a drink. Now Richard's body was quite nice and when someone came up behind <br />
him and put their arm around him he looked around and it was a big muscled man.<br />
<br />
Hi... Bobby stammered.<br />
<br />
Hello hansom.<br />
<br />
Bobby's new body wasn't nearly as nice as this man's was, he was just average a few extra pounds and he had <br />
never thought of his dad's body as hansom but this man seemed to think so.<br />
<br />
Hi. Bobby repeated.<br />
<br />
Wanna go somewhere big guy?<br />
<br />
You mean like a sleep over?<br />
<br />
Yea. Like a sleep over.<br />
<br />
Sure.<br />
<br />
Now Bobby didn't realize where he had found his way into and wasn't aware of what this man wanted but he was <br />
excited.<br />
<br />
We can take my car.<br />
<br />
Oh sure.<br />
<br />
Bobby and the big guy headed off and when they got to the man's home he offered Bobby more beer and he drank <br />
them down like they were cool aid. Bobby wasn't use to drinking so he drank a lot but his body was use to the <br />
alcohol so it took several beers before he began to get drunk.<br />
<br />
When Stan realized that he had gotten Bobby to the right level he moved to the next step and started to <br />
undress Bobby. Stan began stroking Bobby and not being able to control it Bobby soon came heavily. This got <br />
Bobby's head swimming more than just the beer and he found himself in Stan's bedroom naked with Stan's cock in <br />
his back end. This was hitting a spot in Bobby that was causing his eyes to roll back in his head.<br />
<br />
Bobby had grown exhausted and went to sleep with Stan's arms around him. He woke the next morning still <br />
spooning with Stan. <br />
<br />
Can we do this again some time? Bobby said.<br />
<br />
I would like that.<br />
<br />
Could you take me back to the bar so I can get my da.. My car.<br />
<br />
Sure.<br />
<br />
They headed back to the bar and Bobby's couldn't find his car.<br />
<br />
I probably forgot where I parked it. Could you take me home please.<br />
<br />
No problem big guy.<br />
<br />
When Bobby got home his dad had gotten out of his room and was waiting for Bobby. <br />
<br />
Where have you been?<br />
<br />
Stan and I had a sleep over. It was so much fun.<br />
<br />
Can we talk a minute. Bobby and Richard went into another room and his dad asked him what happened. Bobby <br />
didn't see anything wrong with it and told his dad.<br />
<br />
Bobby you don't know what you did. That is what gay men do.<br />
<br />
But it was fun. <br />
<br />
I hope you aren't planning on doing this again. Once is ok for experimentation but you can't do it again.<br />
<br />
But I like it and I am the daddy now.<br />
<br />
YOU CAN'T DO THIS IN MY BODY.<br />
<br />
It's my body now. And Stan and I are going to have another sleep over real soon he said so.<br />
<br />
Would you please switch us back now.<br />
<br />
Well Dad there is a problem there.<br />
<br />
What. <br />
<br />
I can't find the car and the book was in the car.<br />
<br />
Richard's face got so red Bobby thought his dad's head was about to explode.<br />
<br />
Don't worry I will find it.<br />
<br />
Are you telling me that the car and the book have been stolen.<br />
<br />
Oh no I think I just forgot where I parked it. I wasn't very good at driving but I made it there.<br />
<br />
Richard left the room and Stan was still there sitting in the living room. He mister, Richard asked, could you <br />
take us back to where the car is so we can look for it.<br />
<br />
Sure no problem.<br />
<br />
Stan got in his car and Bobby sat up in the front seat with Stan. Richard tried to get in the front with them <br />
to keep them separated but he was told to get in the back seat and as they drove back to the bar Richard <br />
watched as Stan fondled his son. He tried to intervene but he was just pushed off and eventually he had to <br />
watch as Stan and his son played.<br />
<br />
When they got back to the bar they walked for blocks around the bar looking for the car but eventually they <br />
realized that it had been stolen.<br />
<br />
Bobby called the police as instructed by his dad and Stan left them there to report the car stolen.<br />
<br />
The police officer, who had seen way too much desk duty and an over abundance of donuts shops, took their <br />
statement finding it odd that the little boy seemed to be answering the questions more than the adult.<br />
<br />
The car had already been taken to a chop shop but the thief was sitting in a car near the parking lot as he <br />
was reading the book that came with the car. He had happened onto the same spell that Bobby had found and the <br />
transformation commenced. He was changing places with the cop. His young muscled and tatooed body was <br />
inflating like a balloon. He had a dirty wife beater on that was riding up exposing a large expanse of belly <br />
and his pants that were already hanging low showing the tops of his boxers popped the button. There was no way <br />
it was going to snap back in place. He looked out the window and there he saw the fat cop slimming down and <br />
looking like he was wearing a table cloth draped around him. His pants had fallen to the ground and he was <br />
trying to pull them up when the thief wedged himself out of his car and ran up to the cop. Pulling the clothes <br />
from the startled cop he ran back to the car got in and left the naked cop standing there talking to Bobby and <br />
Richard.<br />
<br />
The cop went to his car and called for backup. But when they got there they saw a naked guy standing there <br />
that they didn't know and telling them that he was officer Carl. Not believing him they sent him to the psych <br />
ward to have him evaluated. He was committed and the thief began showing up as the cop. He didn't want to be <br />
the cop but when he got out of the car the book fell from the car and was quickly picked up by a passer by and <br />
the thief hadn't noticed it was gone until he was long gone from the scene.</p>
