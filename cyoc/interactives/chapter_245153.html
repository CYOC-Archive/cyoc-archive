<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next twenty-four hours, Richard studied and explored more of the Chronivac software. During this time, he learned of many of the safety features built into the programme which kept too many people from learning about it at once, such as reducing exposure when a subject morphed in a large, crowded area, as well as ways it protected the user, like how it had overridden both the timer and the ratio of human-to-animal mind he&#39;d set.<br />
<br />
In addition, he learned how to tie the timer into the calendar function. In doing this, he could set it so after any transformation he underwent, he reverted back a minute or so after he&#39;d changed. Exploring this option, he discovered it didn&#39;t seem possible to get it so he&#39;d revert back to before any change, as it seemed this would create too much of a paradox. Which was something else he discovered, as it appeared he existed now both as a timber wolf, and would so for the next eight years, yet, at the same time, was his usual human self. Finding this confusing the more he looked into it, Richard eventually ceased trying to figure it out and moved on.<br />
<br />
Thoughts drifting as Saturday evening approached, and he considered what he might use the Chronivac next for. Having lived the life of a timber wolf for much longer than he&#39;d wanted, he wasn&#39;t too keen on becoming an animal again just yet. Wondering if maybe he ought to become another person, he soon asked himself, &quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not able to answer this, he let the matter fester as he went to prepare himself dinner. Going over all of what he&#39;d learned about the software, how there seemed to be even more he could, his mind kept drifting back to the question of what sort of person he might become. Believing if he did, he might try something where he could meet other people, he wondered if maybe this would be somehow unfair, he decided after a bit, if he did use the programme to become another person, it wouldn&#39;t be to form a relationship of any kind. Sitting down to eat, he toyed with the idea of flipping his sex and gender. Having always been male, a man, and never wanting to be female, a woman, or a girl, he was conflicted on the subject, yet could see by doing so, it might give him a new perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like how being a timber wolf did,&quot; he told himself as he recalled all the new memories he had from the past eight years.<br />
<br />
Dinner finished, dishes rinsed, Richard sat down in front of the laptop. Waking it up, he pulled up a new profile of himself and set to work. Deciding a trial run before he committed to anything would be for the best, he decided, first, to go with idea of being a woman to see how it&#39;d play out. Switching his sex and gender to female, he typed in his new name as Bianca Bellerose. Giving himself a slight Hungarian accent, he set the nationality as Grecian. Next, he shifted the skin tone to have a light-to-medium olive complexion with a slight tan colouring, the eyes to a bit more almond shape, nose smaller, more aquiline, with the cheekbones more defined. Switching his hair to a brunette and lengthening it so it came down to the midpoint of his back, he shifted the colour of his eyes to a medium grey.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with this, Richard moved on to work on the torso,<br />
<br />
Breast size he mulled over a bit, and after flattening the stomach and setting it so Bianca would never have even a pudge, he increased the breast size to two, firm B cups. Nipples always erect, he made them and the areola medium red. Removing any arm, under arm and back hair, Richard made sure there was no chest hair, went back to the facial features and removed any hint of a beard and moustache whilst thinning the eye brows and increasing the volume of the lashes. Finishing, he made a few last-minute adjustments on the torso, like the fingernails, which would always be pointed and well-manicured, whilst the hands would be small, dainty, before moving on to work on things below the waist.<br />
<br />
Pubic hair on the crotch altered to a small triangle patch of soft, curly, brunette hair, he then made the vulva a dusty rose hue. Giving Bianca long legs, he went back and set her height at five-foot even, with most of her height coming from the length of her legs. Setting her weight at a hundred and seventeen, he put in the option of how it could fluctuate, increasing up to but never over a hundred and twenty, unless she became pregnant, and dropping as low as one hundred and fourteen, but never any lower. Going back to the legs, he removed any hair from them, made the feet small and dainty as well, and left the toenails as always being well pedicured. With this all out the way, he started to go into further details, such as her age at twenty, menstrual flow as always light, the option she&#39;d one day have children, but only one, a girl, and she&#39;d carry low and not show, details Richard didn&#39;t foresee ever happening, but felt the need to have to make her more realistic.<br />
<br />
After completing these bits, he went back and made sure her sexual attraction was still set to other human females. Conflicted about the idea he might have sex as a woman, he wasn&#39;t sure if he was ready to go all in and do it with a guy. Feeling leaving it so Bianca was a lesbian was the safer option, he moved on.<br />
<br />
For money, he gave her a seven digit, almost eight, bank account, with an income generated from inheritances and investments. Not wanting to be fully dependent on his own funds, he decided it&#39;d be better if Bianca had her own checking and saving&#39;s accounts, as well as investment portfolios, among other means for her to have captial. After doing this, he went back to update a few things, such as her taste in clothes, which he put as dresses, skirts, the occasional jeans and shorts, tank tops and t-shirts, bikini briefs as her main choice of panties, with her secondary selection being boy shorts, followed by thongs or, if she wasn&#39;t having her period, nothing, selected a number of different options of bras he really didn&#39;t understand the differences in, set it so she despised leggings, would wear tights or nylons if called for, chose a couple shoe selections he hoped went with the rest of what he entered, gave her knowledge in gymnastics and ballet, and after he felt he&#39;d reached the point Bianca was going to be as believable as possible, he saved her as a new profile.<br />
<br />
With a final check over everything, Richard decided he wanted to see how well he&#39;d done. Setting the timer for eight hours, he figured this would give him enough time to take care of some other details, then licked the option to initiate the change.<br />
<br />
The effect immediate, he gasped and stood. As he did this, a ticklish sensation washed over him, and shaking his head, he then shivered as he reached down to cup his crotch. Feeling himself get hard, he slipped a hand inside his pants to work at his erect member, and ended up chasing it as it grew thinner, smaller, and retreated down between his legs. As this happened, his nut sack and balls also pulled between his legs, forcing his testicles up into his body. Vulva forming as interior female reproductive organs developed, it wasn&#39;t long before Richard was teasing an erect clit. His pants and underwear dropping to puddle around his ankles, he stepped away from them, and without giving it a second thought, shucked off his shirt.<br />
<br />
Naked, one hand still between his legs, working at his now moist and sensitive female genitals, Richard was barely aware of the way his hair was growing longer and his facial features rearranged themselves. His focus more on his chest, he watched as his waist became pinched whilst his nipples and areola became more pronounced before starting to push outward. Hips, butt, and thighs morphing as his tits developed into two firm B cup mounds, Richard&#39;s adjusted his hand, and with two fingers, began to explore the area now between his legs. As he did this, he continued to drop in height and weight, all whilst his hands and feet morphed. And as Richard, now Bianca shifted his, now her, stance, and began to slip two fingers into her vagina, the last of transformation finished. Climaxing at the exact moment it was done, feeling herself cum, Bianca gasped out in ecstasy as her male mind gave way to her female mind. Giggling, running her other hand over her smooth, naked skin, she briefly touched her erect nipples, and after a bit felt certain the first thing she wanted was a shower. Scooping up Richard&#39;s clothes, thinking she&#39;d need something for herself, Bianca headed upstairs, where she left the garments on the bed before heading for the bathroom.</p>
