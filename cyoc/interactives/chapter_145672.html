<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So let me get this straight,” Sasha said. “Nate and Adams mom found your ring, used it, your mom found her, and the two turned into kids and watched a movie?”<br />
<br />
“Pretty much,” Gloria shrugged.<br />
<br />
“And not only are you not in trouble,” Diane said. “You ur mom and Mrs. Haskins want to do it again?!?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Felicia said sheepishly. “I was just as shocked as the rest of you. Now we got to figure out how to do that. Nate and Adam still have no idea about the rings.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends couldn’t help but chuckle at their latest adventure with the ring, an adventure none of them were actually a part of. Lisa and Maddie’s impromptu play date had at first worried Gloria and the others as they feared the worse. Even after changing the two grown down adults back, they thought they would be in trouble for sure. That Maddie seemed to enjoy being a kid again as much as Lisa had led to the two women growing closer, which had a benefit for both Felicia and Gloria. Maddie now wanted to get together with Lisa more often meaning the two girls were able to see their respective boyfriends more often.<br />
<br />
“So Jackie has Ann said anything to you about this,” Naomi asked. Jackie sighed, blushing slightly as she shook her head. “Yeah unfortunately,” she groaned. “Lisa is trying to rope Ann into this as well. I may end up going on a play date with the three of them sooner rather than later.” The Girls now laughed as they began to tease Jackie about possibly having to babysit three grown down adults who wanted to relive their childhood for an afternoon.<br />
<br />
“Cmon it’s not that funny,” Jackie groaned. “Oh yea it is,” Sasha laughed. “I would love to be a fly on the wall when you have to deal with 5 year old versions of your girlfriend, Gloria’s mom, and Mrs. Haskins.” Sasha smirked as she now gazed at her own ring. “Actually come to think of it I can be.”<br />
<br />
As the girls continued to talk, Gloria couldn’t help but think how much things had changed since the beginning of the year. At the beginning of September she had been gifted the Ring of Age by her sister Katie. Since then she had made new friends, gotten a boyfriend, a new baby sister, defeated an all powerful sorceress, and grown into a very powerful magic user. Gloria and her friends had gone from naive young girls to very capable young women, women who even Katie trusted without question. As the group continued to talk about the last couple of monthes of Freshman year a portal began to swirl inside her room.<br />
<br />
“Looks like we Have visors Glo,” Sasha sighed. As the group of teens now faced the portal they couldn’t help but smile as Lynne and her friends now appeared before them. “Hey Lynne,” Gloria smiled. “Hey sis,” Lynne said. “Good to see you, needed to talk.”<br />
<br />
“Uh oh what’s going to happen,” Felicia groaned. “Don’t tell me I’m dead again.”<br />
<br />
“What no,” Lynne exclaimed. “But needed to talk with you about Lilith and the Kitsune.”<br />
<br />
“What’s a Kitsune,” Diane asked. The raven haired girl paused as she noticed a blond hair girl and a quiet Asian girl now standing with Lynne, Tricia, and Tommy. “Also who are these two? Never seen them before.”<br />
<br />
Lynne looked back at her companions, noting that they had never really gotten to know Gloria and her friends. “Okay don’t freak out,” Lynne said, watching as her sister and her friends rolled their eyes. “I’ll, um let them introduce themselves.” Beckoning the two forward Gloria watched as the blonde girl smiled broadly befor throwing herself into a tight hug on her.<br />
<br />
“It’s so great to see you Aunt Gloria,” she said, confusing her bewildered aunt. “It’s me Morgan.”<br />
<br />
“Wait that girls Morgan,” Jackie exclaimed. “Katie and Kellies daughter! Morgan LeFay Morgan!!”<br />
<br />
Morgan winced, lowering her head and nodding. “Yeah she’s still a bit embarrassed by that,” Tricia sighed. “But this Morgan isn’t anything like the one that was trying to kill you. She’s a sweetheart.”<br />
<br />
“And a dork,” Lynne mumbled. <br />
<br />
“I am not a dork Lynne,” Morgan whined. “Why are you always picking on me?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t take it personal Morgan,” Tommy smirked. “Lynne’s just jealous that the teachers like you more than her.”<br />
<br />
“Hey who’s side are you in anyway,” Lynne huffed. “Your my boyfriend remember? Since when do you take little miss perfects side.”<br />
<br />
“Probably around the time Morgan made the cheerleading squad and you didn’t,” Tricia giggled. Lynne now turned to her friends as the fiery redhead began argueing with them in earnest. As Gloria watched her little sister she couldn’t help but grin. Her sister seemed to be getting along quite well in her future and her future niece appeared to have grown into a beautiful and polite young girl. “Okay you two can we focus,” she smiled. “Seems like everyone is doing well but can you introduce your other friend?”<br />
<br />
Lynne and the others paused as they turned to look at the quiet Asian girl. “Oh,” Morgan said quietly. “Um, this is going to be awkward considering that...well, it hasn’t become official yet.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean official,” Jackie asked. Morgan sighed as she now took her friends hand, guiding her before the group. “This is my best friend Kari,” Morgan said happily. “She’s Mika and Claudia’s daughter.”<br />
<br />
“Daughter!!!”<br />
<br />
“Adopted daughter,” Kari said quietly. “You see, um, I kind of came from the other timeline. You know the one with your Aunt Kellie. That’s part of the reason we’re here.”<br />
<br />
Kari now turned to her friend, a shy look on her face. “It’s Okay Kari,” Morgan said happily. “They’re family. I mean you’ve know them your whole life.”<br />
<br />
“But they’ve never seen one before,” Kari moaned. “You know how much that freaks people out.”<br />
<br />
“Hey Kari,” Tommy said reassuringly. “Trust me when I say they’ll be cool with it. They might be a bit freaked out at first but they’ll like you regardless.” Kari sighed as she now turned to face Gloria and the others. She was always worried about what strangers would think of her. Focusing her magic Kari now began her transformation into a Kitsune.<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends watched as the girls features began to change. Kari’s face now began to extend, a muzzle pushing out with a small black nose as dark fur began to cover her body. Kari’s ears began to shift, moving to the top of her head as they became pointed. Finally a long and bushy fox tail extended out from behind the girl, slowly wagging back and forth as the teenage Kitsune stood before them. <br />
<br />
“Kari’s a Kitsune,” Lynne said. “Kind of a magical fox person as you can see. The five of us grew up together after Lilith trapped her here. She’s been our friend for as long as we can remember.”<br />
<br />
“And my best friend since preschool,” Morgan added, squeezing the anthrofox girls hand tightly.<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friend stared in shock at the shy fox girl before them. She was in shock that she didn’t know anything about this (or the fact that Mika and Claudia had a daughters). “Wow,” she whispered. Extending a hand, Gloria now smiled at Kari. “Is a pleasure to meet you Kari,” she said warmly.<br />
<br />
Kari smiled, taking Gloria’s hand firmly. “Well,” Lynne said. “Now that the introductions are out of the way we need to talk,”<br />
<br />
Gloria and the others nodded as they now looked to Lynne. “Okay,” she started. “Here’s the thing. Another evil sorceress kind of showed up. Her names Lilith and while she hasn’t been as bold as Morgan was she has caused some problems.”<br />
<br />
“Nothing that’s hurt any of you in case your wondering,” Tricia added quickly.<br />
<br />
“Right,” Morgan stated. “And while we can’t really go into the details, we can say she does cause problems not only in the other timeline but here as well.”<br />
<br />
“So she has access to the other timeline just like Morgan did,” Naomi asked. <br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Tommy said quietly. “She figures out a way to cross over.”<br />
<br />
“Because of  me,” Kari said sadly. “I was the reason. They don’t want to say it cause they don’t want to hurt my feelings but this was my fault. That being said though we came up with an idea.”<br />
<br />
“”What’s your idea,” Felicia asked.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Lynne sighed. “The thing is Lilith has opened up a bunch of portals and caused way too much chaos. Nones died yet but we have had some close calls. We were able to figure it out and realized that if we came back to when she was trying to cross over the first time, we might be able to stop her from crossing over at all.”<br />
<br />
“Is tha going to affect any of you,” Jackie asked. “I mean, your saying Kari came from the other timeline. If we close the portal to Lilith, does that affect Kari?”<br />
<br />
“No I’m already here,” Kari said softly. “No one yet realizes it I’m stuck. It will though stop Fukushu from leading his army here.”<br />
<br />
“Whose that,” Naomi asked.<br />
<br />
“He’s bad news,” Tricia said darkly. “Lilith killed his sister and now he wants revenge on humanity. He blames all of us and has been trying to kill us since the day we were born. If we seal the portal before he can lead his arm through, we save everyone a lot of heartbreak.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and the others nodded, while things seemed to be going well in the future they still had powerful enemies to deal with. Once again the girls seemed task with trying to help the future.</p>
