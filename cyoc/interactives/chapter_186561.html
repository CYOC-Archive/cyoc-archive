<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>If you don&#39;t like the options I put up, you can have it as something else.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a warm and pleasant summer morning as the sun was rising. In a house that was like no other in his neighborhood, a boy by the name of Elijah Darmondy woke up in his bedroom. He was very excited as he was awaiting to see “World War Purge”. As he got out of his bed and commenced his morning routine, he then went downstairs to eat breakfast with his family. “Good morning, sweetie. You’re in a good mood today.” His mother, Angela, said to him as he entered the dining room. “Yeah, I’m alright.” Elijah replied to her.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m glad.” Angela said to her son before he sat down next to his father and started to eat his breakfast, which was a bowl of cereal, some eggs, and some bacon. Later as he was almost done eating, he got a text message from one of his friends, Tommy. “Hey Elijah, you’re gonna be ready to see the new Purge movie in a couple hours?” He asked him as he read his text. “Yeah, I’ll see about that.” He responded.<br />
 <br />
“Mom, is it okay if I go see a movie with my friends today?” Elijah asked his mother. “Why of course, sweetie. As long as it’s not a superbly violent movie.” She answered confidently. “It’s not the new Purge movie, is it?” She asked in a stern manner. “Uh… no?” Elijah seemed to respond in a dishonest way. “Are you sure you’re not lying to me?” Angela asked him again. “No, it’s not. I’m going to see a different movie. Honest.” Elijah was hesitant before continuing to eat his breakfast.<br />
<br />
After he was done, he then put his bowl and plate onto the kitchen sink and proceeded to go upstairs before he heard a knock on the front door. “Elijah, can you see what’s happening outside? I’m kinda busy with your sister right now.” Angela asked him before he went to the front door and opened it to see a mysterious looking package with the return address label coming from TransDem Labs. Although it was addressed to his father, he seemed very interested to see what’s inside.<br />
<br />
“Dad has got to be lucky to get this from his mail.” He thought to himself before closing the front door and went upstairs to his room with the package. When he got inside his room, he closed his door so that nobody could interrupt him. What surprised him when he opened up the box was that it was the company’s new Chronivac. “Holy shit, this can’t be.” He then opened the device up from its packaging and immediately turned it on. <br />
<br />
After he was done setting up his new device, he was greeted with a menu that had a plethora of options that were scattered across its new menu. Unlike the previous Chronivac OS versions, it was more mobile friendly and it wasn’t difficult for him to navigate towards what options he wanted to see. While he was browsing through the options for about an hour and a half, his friend Jeremy texted him that he was on his way to his house. <br />
<br />
“I got to have Jeremy see this when I go see him later.” Elijah was really excited for a while. Eventually, Jeremy’s car landed on his neighborhood before he honked the car’s horn for a bit, getting Elijah’s attention. “That must be him already.” He then picked up his phone, his new Chronivac and his pre-reserved tickets to the new Purge movie before leaving his room and went out of the front door. “So, you’re going to the movie already?” Angela asked him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah mom. I’ll be back in a few hours.” Elijah responded to him. “Alright honey, take care.” He was going to open the door before his pre-reserved tickets slipped out of his pocket. His mother retrieved him as she wanted to see what movie he was going to see, that is before she knew about the actual title of the movie. “World War Purge?!” She was outraged. “Mom, it’s not like what it looks like.” Elijah was worried. “I forbid you to go out to see a movie unless you throw these tickets away.” She said sternfully.<br />
<br />
“But mom, I’ve been wanting to see this movie for months. Why are you so hesitant on me seeing it?” He asked her. “Because you’re not old enough to see it. Especially since it’s ultraviolent and will harm your mind.” Elijah disagreed with her. “Mom, I’m 15. It’s not like I’m going to have nightmares just from seeing this film. I’ve seen plenty of them like World War Purge and they didn’t traumatize me.” Angela didn’t seem to be convinced. “I still don’t think it’s a movie that you should be seeing.”<br />
<br />
“God damn it, mom. This is so unfair.” He pouted. “Look I’m sorry, Elijah. But I’m doing this for the best of you.” She told him. “You don’t know that. I’m 13 and you still treat me like a baby.” Angela didn’t like what said from that tone though. “Elijah, if you’re going to speak to me like that again, then you aren’t going to the movies.” He felt like he wasn’t persuading his mom to go to the movies, so he gave up with arguing against her. “Fine, I’ll just see another movie then.”<br />
<br />
Before he opened the front door, he thought of something that involved using his brand new device. “What if I used the Chronivac to change mom into something and I’ll just go to the movies without her noticing?” He thought to himself. “Alright Elijah, come give mommy a kiss before you go, okay?” As he went over to his mom, he brought out his Chronivac and immediately used it to transform his mom to something else.</p>
