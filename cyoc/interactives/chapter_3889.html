<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty, now in Scott's body, rose to his feet. He was smiling at the thought of what he was going to do. <br />
&quot;It's really hot in here,&quot; he said, and he stripped off his shirt. Ty looked down at his chest in admiration, defined muscles under milky white skin. Scott had a nice body, covered in a tiny amount of hair. <br />
&quot;That's a little better,&quot; said Ty. And he unzipped his pants. The other guys quickly caught on. <br />
&quot;Hey man, keep those on!&quot; Alex exclaimed. <br />
&quot;But Alex, you've never complained before&quot; Ty cooed and moved towards him. He positioned his crotch in Alex's face, who was sitting cross legged. Slowly, he slipped the waistband of his pants just below his bulging underwear.<br />
&quot;DUDE!!&quot; Alex screamed. &quot;Get the fuck away from me!!&quot; And pushed Ty back. Ty let go of the waistband, and his pants fell to the floor. He stepped out of them, and walked suductively towards Alex. In his mind, he gave Alex a boost of horniness. &quot;Don't fight it man, I can see you like it.&quot; Ty said, looking down at Alex's tented shorts. Ty again shoved his crotch inches away from Alex's face, but this time, he lowered his body until he was sitting in his lap. Ty placed one hand on the back of Alex's head, and the other slipped under his shirt. He pulled Alex in, and their lips met. Ty could feel Alex resisting, but Ty was stronger than him. He forced his tongue between Alex's clenched lips, and he played with the nipple he had found. Soon, Alex was no longer fighting him. He cupped Ty's ass in his hands, and began to kiss back. Their tongue's writhed around each other as they explored each other's mouthes.  <br />
&quot;I'm so out of here!&quot; Jeff yelled at no one in particular. Ty broke the kiss, it was Jeff's turn.<br />
&quot;Oh, c'mon Jeff, don't be like that.&quot; He said with puppy dog eyes. &quot;I can make you feel REAL good..&quot; He trailed off as he got up. <br />
&quot;Stay away from me Scott.. I'm warning you!&quot; Jeff exclaimed, backing away from his approaching friend. He looked down at his friend's underwear, and saw his dick sticking up above the waistband.<br />
&quot;Jeff, don't threaten me.&quot; Ty said coldly. He mentally upped Jeff's horniness, and made his sexuality to powerful to ignore. Jeff shocked himself when he felt his cock start to stiffen. Ty approached him. &quot;I know you want to suck this&quot; he said, holding his groin in his hand. And with that, Ty stripped off the tight briefs, revealing his stiff, ridgid cock. Despite every fiber in his body, Jeff fell to his knees. <br />
&quot;That's right.. you're a cock-sucker aren't you?&quot; Jeff said nothing, only licked the tip of Ty's cock. &quot;Uhhhn.. damn, that's nice.&quot; Ty moaned. Jeff took it upon himself to engulf the cock in his mouth. Warmth spread over Ty's body, and he had to will himself to pry Jeff off his groin. Ty looked over at Mark, who was already vigorously jerking off to the Playgirl in front of him. &quot;Wow, guess he already had a bit of gay in him&quot; Ty thought to himself. He then focused his attention on Dustin, his brother. An evil smile crept over his face. <br />
&quot;Dusty, Im sorry I excluded you!&quot; Ty said and sauntered over to the bed where Dustin was lying. <br />
&quot;Scott, no.. please.. I'm not gay.&quot; Dustin pleaded. But it was no use, Ty pinned him down on the bed, straddling him. <br />
&quot;Oh, really? Isn't there anything I can do to CHANGE your mind?&quot; Ty said, with emphasis on change. A look of horror and recognition spread over Dustin's face. <br />
&quot;Ty..&quot; He gasped. All too suddenly, Dustin could feel his mind melting. He moaned as his brother, in Scott's body, nibbled on his neck. <br />
&quot;Step 2,&quot; Ty thought to himself. &quot;I want to change mine and Scott's minds so he is in his body and I'm in the body of the dog.&quot; And a blinding light flooded Ty's vision again. <br />
When Scott opened his eyes, he was on top of Dustin, completely naked. He looked around, and saw Jeff and Alex necking. Mark was still jerking off to nameless models in the magazine. And Scott was incredibly horny. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ty opened his eyes to find himself sucking on his dog-cock. &quot;Dammit Scott, you horny fuck!&quot; He thought. It did feel good though. His long agile tongue caressing his own dick, he could barely pull himself off. But Ty had amazing will power, and he did pull off. Quickly, he changed back to his old self. &quot;Man, this is a far cry from Scott's body. I need to start working out or something!&quot; But now was not the time for that. &quot;Gotta find a camera!&quot; He mumbled to himself. He ran to his room and rummaged through all of his random crap, until he found one. &quot;7 pictures left.. I'll make them good!&quot; And ran to Dustin's room.</p>
