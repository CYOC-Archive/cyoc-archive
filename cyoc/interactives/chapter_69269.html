<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you think people will be wondering why Ai isn't in school?&quot; Miya asked as Pimiko drove to the gym. The major problem with 'Chu's self <br />
imposed orders was that 'lots' was a vague term, and didn't have a concrete definition other than 'large number' and larger itself was even <br />
more subjective. So their best bet to please Master was just to contract as many servants as possible in the five days they had left.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so.&quot; Pimiko said, &quot;Remember that chat we all had while setting up shop in the gym? If it's really her clear cut destiny now to <br />
be a server for the house hold, then people won't question her suddenly not showing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just happy that we have Yuriko now.&quot; Bachiko leaned back. &quot;If things do go south, we're gonna need a lawyer and with her, she can <br />
help optimize master's contracts. Which will make things a lot more easy for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pimiko wondered how the master had gotten this power, was it something he inherited, something he learned? Either way, she wondered <br />
why he had gone to such lengths, maybe her Master simply had a fetish? Or maybe he only had enough fiancees to pay his property taxes <br />
and grocery bills and didn't have the money to pay for servants other than with room and board? <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna see if any of the kids at school wanna become part of our family!&quot; Ai volunteered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not so sure how good an idea that is kiddo.&quot; Bachiko said. Sure, being a cat girl maid was the best, but Bachiko worried how things <br />
might go since they had no idea what the limits were of the 'nothing strange here' aura they all seemed to have. &quot;That many parents <br />
suddenly having their kids live at a big house without them? That might be stretching people not noticing us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay! Their parents can become cat girl maids too!&quot; Ai said jumping with the simply logic of any child. <br />
<br />
Pimiko took a moment to smile at her son/daughter/little sister. <br />
<br />
The contract said none of them would ever again age a day. Ai would always be nine years old. She'd never know what it would be like to <br />
be a woman. She'd remain a pure and innocent child forever. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I'll admit that could work, and it might really help us get 'lots' of new servants for master after all. . . . Hmmm. Yuriko got me <br />
thinking. Maybe we should also have a large group of off-site servants to help with the household's infrastructure. After all, we can't have <br />
the mansion in a bubble. No matter how nice that would be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think we can just contract everyone at the electric company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not. But once someone's contract, they're our sister and understand how important what we're doing is. They can then contract <br />
someone else. And so on. For instance, contract a receptionist, then a middle man drone, then contract a secretary, and contract her <br />
boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember they have to consciously know it's a contract they're signing and we can't lie what it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I remember. The point is, even if we just have five days to do, if we can bring some important or useful people into the fold before then, <br />
we being doing master a GREAT service since it's not just by house keeping that we can serve master.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanna clean and tiddy up!&quot; Ai said in total irony to what she'd have said when she was still Davis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear. But what Bachiko is saying that we can have other sisters who can do things to help the household, us, and the master besides <br />
that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Ai nodded. <br />
<br />
Of course, many were trained to not do something as foolish as sign a contract without reading it. So it was going to be a challenge. In <br />
particular when they had just five days to create their horde for master. <br />
<br />
&quot;So our mission is still to contract as many people as possible before the five days are up.&quot; Pimiko said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's start building up our 'horde.' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Kupochu grinned, feeling a powerful emotional high at the vision. Even if they had just five days to pull it off. Every cat girl maid was <br />
another step to having 'lots' and they would all serve a common selfless cause. <br />
<br />
So even as they drove they planned, taking it beyond what would be a small group of servants, and taking it farther to envision a <br />
commune or town community. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Yukiko had been reborn to be an eye candy cat girl maid and she was performing that purpose in life with absolute zeal as she jogged with <br />
her twin, formerly her boyfriend. Her body continued to turn heads, and she felt proud of it. <br />
<br />
Yuriko's maid outfit wasn't made for showing off her body like her twin or made for athletics like Miya, but it held up. Her glasses held on <br />
easily. <br />
<br />
They were certainly attraction attention, sadly it was mostly teenage boys and young men. However none were worried, none of them felt <br />
worried. After all, their contract said they were protected from anyone (even the master) forcing themselves on them. <br />
<br />
And the contract actually came with a hidden invisible (to prevent abuse) clause to give however tried a nasty surprise. <br />
<br />
In fact, any that talked to them, Yukiko would just turn on the charm, while Yuriko turned on the legal babbles, and the befuddled human <br />
would be singing a contract in no time. Yuriko felt proud of that idea, she WAS a lawyer after all, even if she now lived to serve her master. <br />
Getting people to sign something without giving it a good think first was what lawyers did best (that a distorting facts, but that was <br />
besides the point).<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; They turned to see a pudgy pimple faced lad with itchy contact lenses running towards them. He was huffing and puffing. He was <br />
wearing a shirt with a bunch of anime girls on it, and had on short, and black shoes. &quot;What-what con are you going to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Con?&quot; Miya asked back. Worried someone was onto their offer somehow being a 'con' job (not that they were false advertising.). <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know, convention! I've gotta know! I've never seen costumes as detailed as yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three looked at each other. The geek could recognize they were cat girl maids even if he thought they were costumes? Miya guessed <br />
he didn't considered cat girl maids outside his sphere of reality. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are going to be lots of cat girl maids where we're going.&quot; Yukiko whisper sultry in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you're not really a guy are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yukiko blushed. &quot;Dearie, I can promise you, I have never been, am not, and never will have an Y chromosome.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Er, that's good to know.&quot; The geek stumbled.<br />
<br />
No one was paying attention to them. After all, a geek talking to some ladies on the street? Weird, but none of their business. <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna come with us?&quot; Yukiko continued to turn on the charm. &quot;I can see you want to. Like I said, we're going to have lots of cat girls <br />
where we're going. And while it's members only, we're totally non-exclusive. All you need to do is sign, and poof, you're one of us. Done <br />
and done. No payments of any kind.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Yukiko pulled a contract out from between her breasts and a pen from her dress and handed it to the geek. The geek looked over the <br />
contract and asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I going to have wear woman's clothes?&quot; He asked after reading it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm. Yes.&quot; Yuriko took over, &quot;However you won't be identified as male. At all. And you won't be recognized as male. And all members are <br />
of equal standing. And no, you are NOT being set up for humiliation or something like that. We take every member new or old as family. <br />
It's part of the group charter. And we promise you'll look pretty.&quot; <br />
<br />
The collage age geek laughed and signed. &quot;Dudette. If you could EVER to get me to look pretty in cosplay, I'd like to see you try!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not try. Do. And I'm certain you have on-line and real life friends who might want to join in too.&quot; Yuriko smiled. After all, what was a end-<br />
user-agreement that most people clicked when downloading software other than a contract unto itself? Yuriko didn't know if online <br />
versions of the contract would work. But if it did, and with a otaku as vector, they might be able to get their 'lots' of new maids for master <br />
if it COULD work. <br />
<br />
Conversion happened. And happened fast. Pimiko hadn't seen a change happen so fast. The geek lost several years until he was pudgy boy <br />
of thirteen years old. Then the flab vanished and was replaced by toned muscle. The boy barely had time to comprehend what was <br />
happening to him. The conversion to boy to girl and to cat girl was happening just as fast. His hair turned dark and long, taking on a bowl <br />
cut. Hands and feet became dainty but covered with small scars. Her eyes turned a very dark shade of brown. <br />
<br />
Then came the black triangle ears, short and concise, then a black cat tail. The eyes became yellow and feline. Then the changes got more <br />
intense. Dark blue fur covered her entire body as her face became more feline, decidedly being the most 'anthro' of the lot. <br />
<br />
Her cloths shifted and joined together, while having the low cut and fish nets of a typical cliche maid outfit with frills it also had, a <br />
japanese school girl fuku look to it right out of Sailor Moon. That was when the samurai short sword and long sword appeared along her <br />
waist. Feet became paws, hands became paded and with claws. She was more a humaniod feline than a human girl with cat parts added.<br />
<br />
there were a couple tiny colored triangle 'tattoos' on her face fur that served no purpose other than decoration.<br />
<br />
She stood for several seconds looking at them dumbly and blinked and shook her head looking at her surrounded as if she had just been <br />
born. <br />
<br />
She then fell to one knee and said. &quot;I live to serve. To live is to serve, to serve is to live.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your name will be-&quot; Yukiko started.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Mew. I am a saurami school girl cat maid. I live to serve my master and my family and my household. I shall be the blade that will cut <br />
down all that threaten the master's safety and yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mew?&quot; Yukiko echoed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not much imagination from who she used to be. <br />
<br />
No one paid attention to what was clearly just some cosplayers role playing. Even if some people on the street should have seen the <br />
change happen in front of them. The majority pretended they didn't so they didn't have to get involved in the weirdness and just continue <br />
on with their lives. No news reporter or cop saw the change. And being so fast. Many could pretend they hadn't even seen it. And it was <br />
normal anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Mew. We're on our way to the gym to convert more of our family. You better come along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hai!&quot; She nodded at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;And will you hide those things? We don't want to get arrested for carrying around weapons in public.&quot;  Yuriko said at once.<br />
<br />
Mew just nodded and hide them. . .. down her dress. And like an anime character almost they just seemed to vanish into thin air. <br />
<br />
Mew asked as they jogged, &quot;So we are all slaves? Not that I really have a problem with serving master and household with all of you, but I <br />
like to know where I stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko shook her head, &quot;Not really. Since we're not property, we're not technically slaves. And we can still own our own property, slaves <br />
can't. And it's not like we can bought or sold. It's a service contract. And technically speaking it is still a contract with the master <br />
compelled by the Contract's power to obey his end of the agreement just like we're compelled by it's power to be family and serve him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood. I live to serve.&quot; She said and meaning every word.</p>
