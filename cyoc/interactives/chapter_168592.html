<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam nods excitedly, "I found another vial. I think we should use before we start pounding each other," he said, holding up a vial with an image of a virus on it. "It causes any effects we get from the vials to become able to be transmitted through the user's sexual fluids," he noted. "I was thinking we could find some local furries to fuck and get them to spread this gift to everyone who wants it! We can create a world of real anthros!" he said, the thought of executing a plan causing his thick lupine shaped length to drool a long thick glob of pre come. The anthro wolf panted as his orange-sized balls continued to send their overpruction of wolf semen into hyperdrive. Sam finally caught his breath after a particularally large rope of the wolf's pre-seminal fluids was pushed out the tip of his rod, hitting the ground on the floor beneath the two. "I was originally thinking we should pick a few more vials but just this one has worked splendidly," he said, looking to the large pools of pre on the ground and the pulsating muscles and cocks of both him and his lover. <br />
<br />
Mark nodded in agreement, giving his own length a stroke and shivering as a wave of irresistible lust overtook him for a moment. "True, my love. I think if my cock and ass were any more sensitive and ready to fuck I'd never be able to do anything else! Still, I want to check the vials myself. See if we can perfect this sexually transmitted transformation we are creating." The 8 feet tall anthro tiger had to squat down in order to see all the vials, giving his lover a wide view of his perfectly defined hole. However, before Sam could make a move, Mark turned back to his lover with two vials in hand. One has a crowd of people on it with question marks over their heads, the other an ass with some sort of fluid dripping out. Sam smiled, "I say we use these two before we drink the virus potion." He held up the first potion, "This one says it will make anyone who sees the user's new form render the sight normal, appropriate, and unextrodinary unless we intentionally call attention to it ourselves. So we can walk the streets like this and no one will see it as strange. I'm particularly excited about the note on taking a second dose. If you do, any sexual actions made by the user will also be seen as normal and unnoticeable, as long as it's not involving a non-consenting partner. So I could just walk into work compleatly naked and jack off my rod or pound your hole in public and no one would care! Us ejaculating semen all over someone's stuff would be seen as the eaquivalent of us just spilling a drink on it!" Mark said with a grin. "But this second vial is important too. I was reading the virus vial again. Besides noting that the vial causes the user to be immune to transmitting or recieving any STDs other than the new one we're making, I took particular note of the wording of "sexual fluids". That covers semen and vaginal fluids, but it says nothing about someone being able to transmit the virus from the an infected anthro's ass. I mean, I'd be fine spreading this thing only through pounding holes, but the vial's effects of intense sexual sensitivity feels equal if not higher on our prostates. Plus, if we want to really have this thing spread, we cant leave out bottoms who want to give the virus to humans who use their holes. So this vial I found was perfect! It makes the user's asshole produce a sexual fluid equivalent to a slick lubricant. The lubricant also enhances sensitivity hfor both partners. So no extra lubrication is needed for ass play, the experience is enhanced, and the virus can be spread as well!" Mark concluded with a satisfied smirk. <br />
<br />
Sam nodded egerly, "That sounds perfect! Now lets drink those vials before I lose control of my need to ram you right here; I want our first load to be spent on transforming someone together." Mark smiled and kissed the wolf on the lips, "That does sound romantic. Lets do it." They both traded the two vials, each taking two doses of the first and one of the second after the vials magically refilled. Both of them felt a strange tingeling as their asses began to drip a natural lubricant and their cocks drooled with more vigor. However, their pre and slick was soon glowing neon blue, showing it's now magically contagious nature. <br />
<br />
Sam picked up his phone, still just able to use it with his now large wolven pads (he was glad it wouldn't be too much of in inconvenience for all the anthros they would help create), and found the contact of someone he knew. "I want our first reciever to be my friend Bryce, he's always been a massive furry before there was even a well known name for it. It's only fair that he gets first dibs. And he's hella hot, so we'll have a good time," Sam said with a smile. Sam texted Bryce that they were coming over and the two walked nude across the neighborhood to where Sam's friend lived, happy to see no one pay their changed forms any mind. When they got there, Bryce answered the door and looked up at the two without a hint of suprise. "Oh, hey Sam! This must by your boyfriend Mark. Thanks for stopping by!" Mark grinned and rubbed his tiger cock until it stood at it's full foot long erect length, moaning as his grapefruit sized testicles churned at the thought of sliding into Bryce's hole. Sam had a similar reaction, beginning to finger his now always slick ass with his padded claws, his 10 inch wolf cock sticking out inches from his friend's face. Bryce was none the wiser, tilting his head slightly as if neither of his two guests had done anything at all. "So, uh, is there a reason you wanted to see me?" he said in a casual tone. Sam grinned, "Yeah, actually there is. I was telling Mark here about how much of a furry you are. We found out a way to make that fantasy come true, and we want to share it with you. Just look at us!" he said with a smirk. Bryce's eyes suddenly widened as he did a double take of the situation. Two tall anthros, one tiger and one wolf, both staring lustily into his eyes as one fingered their hole and the other fucked their hand, both's massive members nearly dripping their blue pre onto his face. "Holy shit! This is amazing! Y-You mean you can make me like what you two look like now?" he excitedly said. Mark smiled, "Yep, all you need to do is take this blue colored semen up your hole or put your dick up one of our lubricated asses. Though I suppose you could drink it too, wanna try?" he said, shoving his beer can thick cock head up to Bryce's face with a playful thrust, a spurt of thick sticky pre landing directly in the human's suprised mouth. Bryce swallowed it and his eyes widened more, "Y-Yeah, I can feel something wanting to shift inside me. You guys are right! That deliciously thick pre come you just shot down my throat is already making me feel like I'm going to transform!" he said with wide eyes. Sam smiled, "I'm glad you're excited Bryce, but I think it would be more fun if you let us transform you from both ends," he said, turning his back to the human and spreading his legs to reveal his hole dripping with blue slick. "Hell yeah!" Bryce exclaimed, pulling his pants and boxers off and pushing his already moderately endowed 7 inches into the anthro wolf's behind. He moaned along with Sam as the tight slickness of the anthro wolf's ass became more and more pleasurable, the blue slick's effects kicking in with more and more intensity. Not to be out done, Mark let his cock drool pre all over Bryce's hole, smearing it around with his length's head and fingering his ass with his paws before lining up his foot long length up to the human's pucker. "Heh, don't forget about me! I'm sure you want this foot of tiger cock up your ass. Don't worry about getting injured though, the ability for us to transmit this transformation comes with the perk of being able to take any rod and fit in any hole," Mark noted with a tender rasp. Bryce moaned at the thought, nodding eagerly, "As if I'd even care about getting hurt otherwise! Now shove that rod of tiger meat into me!" he said between moans. Mark smirked and slammed the entire length into Bryce up to the hilt, pounding his prostate over and over as his grapefruit sized balls bouced against the human's ass. All three soon came in no time at all, Mark and Sam blasting rope after rope of blue sticky semen out of their lengths as Bryce filled Sam's slicked behind. They all pulled out of each other, observing the strands of blue come that seemed to cover every surface within a ten feet radius. Bryce moaned as his body shook, beginning to change. "Thank you! That was the best fuck I've ever had. N-Now, I feel the power surging into me from your come and slick!" <br />
<br />
Sam and Mark looked on in excitement as Bryce changed into an anthro...</p>
