<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob was in his last class of the day when the announcements came over the intercom.  It was the usual announcements that were typical of a normal high school, although Rob found it unusual that there weren&#39;t many sports announcements.  There was one announcement in particular that he found rather strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, we will address the issue at this year&#39;s Halloween Dance.  It has come to our attention that the punch was indeed spiked by a rogue, and it caused some of our students to act unusually.&quot;  Rob noted how unusual the wording was for this announcement.  &quot;The person responsible for this tried to escape, but was killed in the attempt.  We take the safety of our students very seriously, and we regret that this happened.  We would like all students who were affected by this and who entered into were society to please come up to the counseling office after classes are over.  Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob&#39;s face twisted as he tried to figure out the unusual announcement.  Rob and his family didn&#39;t move in until the following Sunday, so they wouldn&#39;t be a part of the Halloween Dance.  Thus, he wouldn&#39;t know exactly what the announcement was talking about.  On top of that, there were some...rather unusual things said in that announcement.  &quot;Rogue&quot;  &quot;Were Society&quot;.  What did those mean?  Rob scratched his head as he tried to figure it out rather than paying attention in class.  His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the school bell signaling the end of the school day.<br />
<br />
He gathered his things and made his way out of the classroom.  His mind was so engrossed in figuring out the announcement that he didn&#39;t see where he was going and ended up walking into someone.  Rob fell back to the ground, and after rubbing his head, he looked up to see who he ran into.  &quot;Sorry,&quot; he mumbled as he tried to pick himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; a female voice called out, &quot;You should watch where you&#39;re going.&quot;  Rob looked up and noticed the same girl from the library.  She was leaning over him, and he could notice that she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra.  &quot;My eyes are up here,&quot; she said with mock scorn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he mumbled again as he tried to avert his eyes.  She just giggled as she offered her hand to help him up.  &quot;Um...Amy was it?&quot;  She smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, that&#39;s me!&quot; she said, &quot;And I&#39;m glad you remembered my name.&quot;  She took a moment to think and said, &quot;And you&#39;re Rob, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; he said.  He could feel his face getting warmer as he tried to keep from looking at her.  &quot;So, um,&quot; he started to change the topic, &quot;What was that announcement about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that,&quot; she said as she leaned up against the window, &quot;Just some things that happened at the Halloween Dance.  I think a few students got a little too much into it and well...ended up getting fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Rob asked, &quot;What do you mean?  And what&#39;s this were society that I heard about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy paused as she looked at Rob.  &quot;You...don&#39;t know...do you?&quot;  Rob just shook his head as he looked confused.  She sighed and said, &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t know by now, I suppose you&#39;ll learn soon enough.  You can ask Samantha Twist when she comes to visit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The town chancellor?  She&#39;s the one who visits all the new families who move into this town and lets them know...about this town and its secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why are you being so...so...&quot; Rob tried to think of the right word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cryptic?&quot; Amy finished his question.  &quot;Well, let&#39;s just say that it isn&#39;t up to me to say what&#39;s really going on here.&quot;  She smiled and turned to walk away.  &quot;Like I said earlier, you&#39;ll find out soon enough.&quot;  Rob watched as Amy continued to walk away down the hall.  He shook his head as he made his way out of the school building.<br />
<br />
He made his way out of the school and then found his sister waiting for him.  &quot;Hey Rach,&quot; he called out before noticing something unusual about her.  &quot;Umm...something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My best friend is a werecow,&quot; she said rather flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  A were-what?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Werecow.  Or at least that what she said,&quot; she replied as the two of them walked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you believe her?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Rachel said rather thoughtfully, &quot;I mean, have you noticed how unusual the student body looks.  And looking at her, she&#39;s definitely not the same as she was in Michigan.  She&#39;s...gotten bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Puberty tends to do that,&quot; Rob said rather dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but not to that degree.  And believe it or not, she matches the rest of the student body here.  Or at least the female student body. And what&#39;s really strange is she told me that this town is a sanctuary for weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob looked at her with his face twisted in a bit of disbelief.  &quot;Like in werewolves and whatnot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said and sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure what to believe.  I mean, I&#39;m sure she wouldn&#39;t lie to me, and her story does seem to match up with the...strangeness of this town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...werewolves are just fiction.  Stories made up to scare kids like us,&quot; Rob retorted.  &quot;There&#39;s no way that they can be real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure,&quot; Rachel said softly.  &quot;If what she&#39;s saying true, it&#39;d explain so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two siblings arrived at their house.  They noticed their parents and older brother moving things into the house.  &quot;At least tonight we&#39;ll be sleeping in our real beds and not in those sleeping bags.  I wonder if we got the internet.  I gotta be losing subscribers at this rate.&quot;</p>
