<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The Jackass Bar &amp; Grill&quot; It loomed in front of me as I stood on the side street leading only up to the establishments front door. A casual look around from me was brought about as if someone was watching me watch them.<br />
<br />
One need only look at the front of the building to wonder if this isn't a place of skullduggery? A two story head of a jackass sets atop the front entrance. The ears of the jackass wiggle back and forth slowly as if to urge people to check it out.<br />
<br />
Stepping onto the red carpet runner the front doors open slowly giving you the mixed sounds from inside. The bar is the loudest as the rythum of deep soft druming suggest a stripper or worse doing their act or acts. The oposite side is the &quot;Stable Time&quot; lounge a place to have a quiet drink or even dinner. <br />
<br />
I stood looking around and then the sign caught my eye. &quot;Donkey Breath Massage Parlor&quot; a pointer for going upstairs into the huge jackass head and get your needs met and pains rubbed. I shuddered to think what might happen up there, of course if I were maybe twenty years old and looking, I might go check it out?<br />
<br />
Midday hunger was getting the best of me so I'd thought to begin with a good lunch. Turning to walk into the Lounge my arm was touched by a warm and soft hand.<br />
<br />
A jerking surprised twist brought me face to face with of all people a Marcia Caldwell. Marcia and I had not worked the same side of the street since the Ely Kazan investigation two years back.<br />
<br />
We greeted eac the other and I pointed to the Lounge where I'd planned to go and eat my lunch. Marcia on the otherhand pointed me toward the Bar saying &quot;business before pleasure!&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter directed us to a corner table with at least some privacy. The music was to say little louder than too loud and I had to yell to talk with Marcia.<br />
<br />
She informed me of her reason for being there as I did for mine. We were just getting our drinks when the Announcer came on the center round stage to announce Danny the Wonder Pony and his good friend Marsha.<br />
<br />
Marcia hushed me to be quiet and we sat there and watched the passion play to come. Well I was a little taken that this nice lady was at all enjoying the dancing and the sex act which happened before our eyes. <br />
<br />
As Marsha danced and seemly got Danny the pony enthused she layed over a couple of bar chairs her legs spread wide and offering her sex to the pony.<br />
<br />
Danny boy needed little prompting as he stepped forward his pony's cock out rigid as hell. He sniffed her groin and gave a slurping lick to her sexual opening. Then with an agility I'd never witnessed in a pony, horse or any animal he bounced up on the chairs and straddled Marsha's chest.<br />
<br />
Now I would have expected him to set all over her but he didn't! Marcia gave me a punch in the ribs as if to take special interest as Marsha guided the massive cock to touch her, I'd think, moist opening. The pony slowly mover the flared head of his big cock into her and after some slower than slow action he began as a pony might.<br />
<br />
Again I've seen and watched on my Father's farm the stallion mount and enter his mare. The sexual act is quick and rawly harsh causing sme mares to buck and kick from the entry, not so with Danny here.<br />
<br />
The sexual act continued till thin streams of pony stallion's cum and semen erupted out Marsha's sex lips. The pony shortly after stepped down and sauntered backstage, now this was all, all wrong!<br />
<br />
A stallion, horse, jackass, or pony will annoint himself with the nares juices or lick her vulva as a gesture of dominance. He will stand there with his flucid cock out and drying while the mare stands quietly by enjoying the last fire of their love makings.<br />
<br />
The stud always trumpts a whinnied scream of dominance before heading for the pasture, Danny didn't do any of this, nothing!<br />
<br />
Our drinks were finished and marcia urged me to walk outside. The light of day and quiet was a welcomed change from the past hour's feature act.<br />
<br />
Marcia asked me what I thought, and I asked her if she went to see such acts often?  A kick in the shins was my answer. Marcia asked what I thought of the pony and how he acted if normal or what?<br />
<br />
I told her what I've explained thus far to you and she agreed that Danny was very strange acting for a equine born an equine. Then I asked if she being a Para- What's it had some thoughts on the pony.<br />
<br />
We walked off to a secluded park bench and I listened to her yarns.<br />
Her story was that two brothers came to the Park last month. One, the younger returned home with a wild story about this Jackass Bar. Seems that the two brothers entered and sitting down were offered the daily special, &quot;Jackass Punch.&quot;<br />
<br />
One brother downed the punch asking for more since the stuff was free. The other brother not liking hard drinks ordered only water and a Coke. As her story goes the band stopped playing and waiter, band and all employees left all to once. A man dressed in white came out on a balcony and announced to his patrons that they were all going to become Donkeys.<br />
<br />
Everybody thought it was part of the act, but when some poor slob at the bar denoted his donkey ears and tail growing, well the place got a little ugly.<br />
<br />
The one brother who drank the Donkey Punch began to change too. His younger brother aided him to escape the Bar and they ran off into the crowds.<br />
<br />
Now if her story stopped there I'd of laughed. It didn't she had photos of the older Brothers face just two hours after their escape. They got a room at the Chandler Hotel nearby the private lake inside the Park. Camera in hand he took continuous photos of his brothers change from human to a average sized gray male donkey.<br />
<br />
I studied the photos for the normal signs of photo manipulation but found none. I asked her what the catch was? She told me that the Bar and it's grill in question had a long history in people just vanishing off the face of the earth.<br />
<br />
Lookin at the photos I had to say one must agree this is a good place to begin my questioning of Jimmy Winton.</p>
