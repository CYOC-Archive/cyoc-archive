<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Denise watched as the blonde girl with a red one piece swimsuit leaps off of the diving board. Perform multiple somersaults before diving head first in the pool below. Denise watched as the girl swam out of the pool to head to the diving board to perform the maneuver. She scanned the pool area to note a group of roughly twenty elderly women in the shallow end of the pool; performing water aerobics to the tune of terrible dance music from the mid-nineties. On the far side was a few swim lanes. One was being occupied by a thirties something male in a black speedo.<br />
<br />
Denise sighed as she thought the rec center would be busier than what she sees. She went through all the motions when entering the building. Making small talk with the front staff as she paid the fee for entry, was handed a towel and motioned to the women’s changing area. Thanking the person she walked into the gender assigned change area. Denise snorted as she made her way to an empty locker. The Anthro Tigress Furry knew that such notions as single sex washrooms and change rooms will soon give way to communal facilities. As furry’s feel comfortable in their own body; they feel no shame in exposing their genitals. Plus clothing is anathema to furry; the clothing feels constrictive and irritable to the fur. So Denise was disguised as her old human self; thanks to the glamour she cast with the runes glowing softly on her ankles and wrists. They made the illusion the she was removing her clothes to expose a playful looking tiger stripped two piece bikini. Denise giggled at the thought as she closed the locker and walked to the pool area. She was holding an aerosol can hold her atomized mixture of compressed gas and the furry virus in an airborne solution. The can was disguised to look like a towel as she walked to pool.<br />
<br />
She depressed the nozzle to let the air out to mingle with the dense humid air in the pool room. Walking by the exercising group and pretending to accidently bump into the teenage girl; Denise walks to the back of the pool towards the sauna/steam rooms.<br />
‘Perhaps there are people in there,’ Denise mused; as she opens the door and pauses to see a large air grille. It was roughly two feet wide by one foot deep.<br />
‘This has to be for the return air,’ Denise thinking as she removes the grille and discharges the entire contents of the can into the ventilation system. Taking into account for the high humidity, Denise approximates that the furry virus should fully infect everyone in the pool room in roughly twenty minutes. Spotting a life guard approaching, Denise quickly puts the vent back in place and begins to open the door to the sauna.<br />
<br />
As she enters the threshold, the life guard gets a half step from her as she grabs him and yanks the young man into the sauna. She buries her tongue down his throat as she lets her illusion fade so he can see her true furry form. She keeps her tongue in his mouth as he struggles to break free from her strong grip. Ensuring that her infectious saliva mixes with his, pushing small amounts down his throat with her tongue. His struggles soon begin to fade as she sensed the virus taking hold. Pulling back, she allows the young man to rip off his lifeguard shirt and swim trunks. Seeing his plain looking penis at full mast; Denise giggled. <br />
‘Tiny compared to Michael’s,’ Denise smiled as she guides the man down. climbing on top of him, she positions her dripping pussy above his face as she starts dancing her tongue around his shaft.<br />
“Start licking,” Denise growls as she takes in the man’s shaft and starts sucking.<br />
The man moans as his eyes roll back in pleasure. A couple drops of the Tigress’s juice drop onto his lips; instinctively making him burying his face into her swollen feline cookie.<br />
<br />
Denice moaned as she bobbed and danced her tongue around the lifeguard’s shaft. Seeing that his feet were developing webbing between the toes as they shift and sprout thick brown fur. The fur travels up the man’s legs as it his cock and balls. Denise can also feel fur growing on the man’s chest and arms. Feeling his frame broaden and barrel out further; feeling his hand paws get a better grip on her hips as his muzzle pushes out and small round ears grow on the top of his head. The life guard grunted as he blew his load, as he felt the anthro tigress’s snatch quiver and let loose with her fluids.<br />
<br />
Denise enjoyed the afterglow for a few more minutes as she felt the new furry’s manhood retreat into its sheath. Getting up she finally notices that the life guard became a cute looking otter furry just as a thick tail bursts forth and  magic runes appear on his wrists and ankles.<br />
“Not sorry,” Denise looking at the stunned otter furry and smiling; “not sorry at all.”<br />
“Not exactly complaining,” the otter lifeguard cupping his furry balls and admiring their larger heft; “I can’t wait to try out the new equipment.”<br />
“Sorry,” Denise smiling as she puts up a clawed finger; “I already have a mate, and I’m in the middle of some tests.”<br />
“What kind of tests,” The anthro otter following the tigress; ignoring his uniform as he felt no need to wear garments. Observing as she pulls out a canister from the return air duct.<br />
“Finding more efficient ways in spreading our gift,” Denise causing her runes to glow as she reassumes her disguise. A disguise that the otter anthro can naturally see through as it is meant to fool human eyes.<br />
“You might want to disguise yourself,” Denise looking at the Otter; “in case the people out there have yet to change.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” the otter managing the magical spell with little effort; “name is Tommy. Tommy Rudderpaws.”<br />
“Doctor Denise Proudhoof,” the tigress furry answering in return while opening the door back to the pool room. The tigress smiles as she cancels the glamor. She sees that the man that was wearing a black speedo, was now a Anthro Crane Furry; he was on top of a cute looking Anthro Jackal furry. She assumes that this was the girl with the red one piece that is now floating on the surface of the pool. Denise could tell that the swimsuit was ripped apart with sharp claws. The twenty elderly women who were exercising were now causing quite the commotion as newly transformed furries; they dog piled each other in a massive orgy of licking and fingering each other’s hungry cunt.<br />
“I think I will see if they need help,” The anthro otter grinning as he makes a bee line to the group; his barb shaft at full mast, bouncing to and fro as he saunters towards the group<br />
<br />
Denise smirks as she walks into the changing room. Not caring that she went through the men’s change room; Denise was pleasantly surprised to see a couple of men already in mid transformation each stroking themselves as they both turn into an elephant and hippo furry respectively. She walks out of the change room to see the attendant that greeted her, now a basset hound furry; furiously fingering herself and her tongue lolled out of her muzzle. Denise allowed her to finish before coughing to get her attention.<br />
“I believe the changes room will need to be revised to one large communal changing area,” Denise grinning; “no shame in showing off the assets to the opposite sex.”<br />
“I and the rest of the staff will look into it,” the attendant grinning as she understood. The ideal of gender separation was a concept that furrys find silly and archaic.<br />
Denise nods at the basset hound furry as she heads outside.<br />
“I think a lunchbreak is in order,” Denise smiling as she walks to her car and gets in. “Plus I want to meet my mate’s twin sons,” Denise turning over the engine as she make a mental note to document the results of this second test. Pulling out  of the parking lot she begins the short ten minute drive to Michael Proudhoof’s family restaurant.</p>
