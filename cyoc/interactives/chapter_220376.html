<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad left the bathroom, and gaped at what he saw. From the photos and decor, Chad quickly deduced he was in Rod&#39;s bedroom, and Rod was in college, and he was apparently president of a fraternity.  He was in a frat house.  His stomach rumbled. He ran back into the bathroom and vomited again. How many years had past?  It had to be at least 2 or 3, maybe four for Rod Toulemann to be president of a frat house at State. Damn, he and Rod were supposed to be roommates at State after high school graduation.  He looked around the room. Well, he guessed they had been roommates sort of.<br />
<br />
He walked over a neatly piled stack of clothing on the bed. There was an envelope on top of the stack addressed simply, &quot;CHAD&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chad took out and unfolded the enclosed letter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Chad! Bet you thought you&#39;d be my sex doll forever, if you can remember any of that. If you can still read. Rick said he wasn&#39;t sure if the antidote would work after all this time. And neither of us are sure if it will work at all.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m getting married next, so I won&#39;t be needing you after that. So I figured I&#39;d use the antidote on you as a wedding gift. Rick said it would probably take hours, maybe days for it to work. So I&#39;m leaving you this letter, in case you reconstitute when I&#39;m away.<br />
<br />
Rats, there wasn&#39;t enough antidote,  maybe it evaporated, I coated every inch of you down to the Speedo that Lissa insisted I put on you to make you decent. Oh, she does know you are really Chad, she just thought you were my weird sex doll. She made me promise to get rid of &quot;that awful sex doll&quot; before our marriage. It kind of prompted me to give you the antidote now. Anyway I coated your upper body and fucked it down your throat, then did your legs. But there was barely enough to lube up my condom to fuck you ass. Anyway part of you is still blue, but Rick said he thought if the antidote worked it might spread to the blue bits, and he would have another dose of antidote within two to four weeks depending on how long it takes to get the ingredients. Something about wolf&#39;s bane being out of season, and having to get flower shipped from Southern Hemisphere. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s been 3 days since I applied the antidote ointment,  and there&#39;s no sign of change, so maybe we&#39;ll try again when Rick has a fresh batch of antidote. <br />
<br />
Oh, if you are reading this, then put on these clothes.<br />
<br />
See you soon. I hope, Rod.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Chad rolled his eyes. He fingered his blue hole. Nope Rod didn&#39;t run out of antidote. He wanted to have a FWB until his wedding day when Rick would shoe up with more antidote. <br />
<br />
Chad examined the clothes. They confirmed his suspicion,  the shirt and shoes were men&#39;s wear spandex in State&#39;s colors, but the tights were labeled &quot;unisex&quot;, which meant no room for a bulge. It was probably Rick&#39;s nasty idea to not restore my male genitalia until after the wedding.  The only question was how long after.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s stomach rumbled again. <br />
<br />
Once more he knelt at Rod&#39;s porcelain throne. After a couple dry heaves, he washed up and dressed. He found his phone under the clothes. There was a charger on Rod&#39;s desk that fit. He tried logging into Rod&#39;s computer to see what had happened over the last 4 years. It was password protected.<br />
<br />
He sighed. Then he looked at the bottom of the keyboard, and in the desk drawer. Then he spotted a slip of paper taped to the monitor. <br />
<br />
Sure enough Rod had posted his password in plain sight. Chad logged in. First thing he did was Google his parents, his brothers,  and himself.<br />
<br />
His folks had moved two years after he vanished. He did a double take when he read that his brother Brad had been President of Rod&#39;s fraternity.  Ew, that meant Brad had probably used Chad as a sex doll too. He wondered if Brad knew. Brad was still at State, but as a grad student at the veterinary school. He picked up his phone, and tried to ring Brad up. NO SERVICE.<br />
<br />
He read up on Rod and Lissa&#39;s nuptials, but could barely find anything about Rick online.  Chad wanted some solid food, and maybe to reactivate his phone. He needed money. There was some change in the desk drawer,  but he found some cash under the mattress.<br />
<br />
He wrote a note to Rod and left it on the keyboard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rod,<br />
Congratulations on your marriage.  I&#39;m not all myself yet, so I&#39;ll be back for the antidote after I get a bite to eat. <br />
See you soon,<br />
CHAD!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad wanted to write how could you have forgotten about me for 4 long years! But he needed to be on good terms with Rod and Rick if ever wanted to be a man again.<br />
<br />
He quietly exited Rod&#39;s room. The fraternity was on Sycamore Street. Chad had visited when Brad pledged his sophomore year. It looked pretty much the same. It was cold outside, so he grabbed a sweatshirt from the frat house lobby emblazoned with their Greek letters.<br />
<br />
He headed toward the mall food court. The Sears and Bed Bath and Beyond were boarded up, out of business.<br />
<br />
He spotted his phone provider&#39;s kiosk. He went over to ask about reactivating his<br />
phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? Well, I can&#39;t do that. Your account is still active, but your old phone is 3G. Everything is  5 G now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad rolled his eyes. They had been trying to get him to 4G during his senior year, and his parents promised to upgrade his phone for graduation.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much for 5 G, well under your family plan, I can give you this little beauty for free. But you will owe $750 if you cancel the plan. Say are you a member of Gamma house?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Chad asked cautiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m an alum. I&#39;ll waive the activation fee, if you have your frat ID.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my brother Brad was at the frat years ago, I&#39;m thinking about pledging,&quot; Chad said hesitantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah. You look a bit like Brad. So sorry to hear about your other brother. Real tragedy.  Did they ever find the body?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad almost asked what happened to Dylan, then he realized the man was talking about his own disappearance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rather not talk about it. You can activate the phone though, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure. I&#39;ll waive the fee anyway for a future frat bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad left with a working phone.  He was famished now and headed toward the food court.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a hotdog on a stick, a lemonade and a churro, and rolled his eyes at the prices.<br />
<br />
He was still hungry,  but his stomach was making rumbling noises, so he decided to walk around a bit.<br />
<br />
He belched loudly. He decided to visit the restroom.</p>
