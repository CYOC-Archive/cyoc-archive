<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew went to go do some bench press, figuring his chest needed the work, and he got on there shortly after another jock left the machine, giving him a cordial &quot;your go, man&quot;, and then heading to the barbells to do some curls. Andrew found himself staring a little. Damn that was a guy who knew how to work his arms. Girlfriend must enjoy how big and strong her man was. He took his seat and sighed - he wasn&#39;t usually this...prone to gawking, but he guessed maybe muscling up made him a little more naturally randy. It did certainly explain the jocks and how they behaved.<br />
<br />
As Andrew loaded out the bench with a 45 on each side followed by a 10 and a 5, for a total of 165, he did some light stretching and then took his seat, breathing and hoping that his proximity would not be immediately noticed. After all, Steve was showing Brody some other poses he could do. It definitely looked like Brody was pleased to learn all of this.<br />
<br />
Andrew found himself grunting with satisfaction as he started his workout. His muscles were burning with exertion as he took up a more spread out grip, focusing on the more general exercise form for bench, hitting his arms, chest, shoulders and lightly in his rear delt from stabilization. Andrew found himself powering through his former high mark on bench, the 20 new pounds of muscle more than doing their work as he enjoyed the sensation. It was like waking up from sleeping inside of a deep pool, and walking around clearly for the first time.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it was more than a little clearer to the young libertine how and why the jocks were so prone to their showboating. He managed to get to 12 reps, much further than he&#39;d ever managed to get prior to the Chronivac landing on his doorstep. Andrew racked it with a loud grunt and barely thought of the consequences before he saw a familiar shadow looming over him. Ah crap, Andrew thought to himself, just figured actually enjoying himself would see the attention of the bully brought down on him.<br />
<br />
But for once it seemed Brody&#39;s attitude was not focused in the direction of hostility! &quot;Well, do my eyes deceive me or is the nerdy guy I knew buffing up for once?&quot; Of course even his compliments were rather blunt and unkind, but then, such was Brody. The changing athlete continued, &quot;Damn, much as I made fun before, you&#39;re progressing really quickly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting back up, Andrew figured this was maybe Steve&#39;s influence. Or that change that was supposed to be ongoing.<br />
<br />
And you, Andrew thought to himself with a wry grin, cannot progress fast enough. &quot;Yeah...yeah, I just started on a new protein shake. Nice stuff...&quot; Andrew put his arm up to flex, and Brody immediately took the chance and cupped it, pushing on the muscle. He seemed impressed by how tight Andrew&#39;s arms were now, which surprised him because DAMN did that feel tight.<br />
<br />
Brody crossed his arms, &quot;...those are some tight fucking biceps. Shouldn&#39;t be long before you can start working toward gettin&#39; some pythons like these!&quot; He flexed his arms in a showy pose, and Anthony saw that he didn&#39;t seem to mind the bisexual blooming athlete looking a bit long. In fact, Brody even smirked a little, and said outright, &quot;What? You wanna feel em?&quot;<br />
<br />
He got down on his knees beside the bench and flexed again, letting Andrew reach out and gingerly feel at the tight musculature. It was everything Andrew could do to keep himself from springing erect at this. Because he knew even though Brody was acting nice now, that kind of thing would bring out the bully act from him again. Andrew felt the triceps and said, &quot;You&#39;ve...really got well developed triceps...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brody took the chance to brag, &quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;m pretty proud of em. Been hitting both heads.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both heads? &quot;Uhh...don&#39;t see anything like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brody shook his head and stated, &quot;&#39;Course I gotta be the one to explain. See how my arm looks? That comes from hitting two different parts of the tricep muscle. You gotta hit both if you wanna look good. Comprendo?&quot; Brody asked as he clapped Anthony&#39;s back a few times.<br />
<br />
Well, Andrew thought as he rocked back and forth from the contact, you learn something every day. &quot;Thanks man, I&#39;ll uh, try and hit it, so I can get my arms looking as good as yours.&quot; Andrew got up and Brody seemed to pause, as if thinking about something.<br />
<br />
He turned and looked at himself, &quot;Oh yeah...not many guys are as hot as me. You could get there though...not sayin&#39; I&#39;d find you attractive or anything, just...&quot; He faded into some uncharacteristic mumbling, before Steve called him back over to go do some other training. Brody went off and Andrew was left wondering if this was the effect of the 10% change for today taking effect. He watched Brody and Steve joke, talk about sex and girls and pumping iron, all the while he pumped iron on my own and even found himself enraptured by some of their sex talk from afar.<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe while I was changing them, they were impressing on me a more sexually adventurous side to myself. I&#39;d be open to fooling around with Brody when he was well and truly done, but the girls around here...&#39; Andrew thought as he considered his options. Still, the emergent athlete found himself deciding he would muscle himself up a bit more, and then try his luck around here. The girls here were club girls, here honing their builds before heading in at night with the hottest boys in town. They had their standards set.<br />
<br />
And he needed to meet them there, rather than expect them to alter those standards.<br />
<br />
By the time the workout was done, Andrew was red faced for more than one reason. He was excited for the sexual opportunities his recent days represented, and even more, as he went into the locker room, he was faced with two astonishing specimens; both Steve and Brody getting ready for a shower. If Andrew thought Brody was impressive before, it was seeing him denuded that really impressed upon the young bisexual what fortune he was going to have going forward.<br />
<br />
He decided not to try his luck however unless circumstances aligned, and so started changing clothes out of his gym attire back to his street clothes. Andrew looked at his towel and then heard someone say something...</p>
