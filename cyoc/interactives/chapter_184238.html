<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is a POV story that I wrote that comes from a different family. It would still be in the same story as the &quot;Toddling Species&quot; one because some of the characters in the story would be relevant in the one I&#39;m writing.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a sunny afternoon in the roads of the northeastern United States. Jesse, who previously worked at the TransDem Southeast headquarters as a regional manager in Atlanta, has been given a job to work at the company’s corporate headquarters in Cuyawayne, New Jersey. It’s been a long day for them as they were driving up from Georgia, where they had to stay at a motel the night before. With him was his wife Skyler, his toddler son David, and his teenage daughter Holly. “Why couldn’t they get someone else to get that job? It really annoys me that we’re just moving on such short notice.” Holly pouted as she was in the backseat of the car. “Relax, Holly. You should be lucky your dad was given this opportunity to be given a better job after working very hard.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. We’ll get to spend more given with my new salary and you could hang out with some new kids at your new school. Sounds pretty neat if you mention that your dad works at TransDem.” Jesse chuckled as he was driving. “But I miss all of my friends. I even had plans to go to Six Flags in a couple days.” “Well, we’re sorry about that Holly. I know it meant very much to you. But your dad really wanted this job for a very long time.”<br />
<br />
“Hey. Maybe we could go to the Six Flags nearby after we unpack our things for a couple of days.” Jesse tried to cheer Holly up. “But it’s not the same when I can’t see my friends as much anymore.” Holly still felt bummed. “Don’t you at least have them as contacts on your phone?” Skyler wondered. “Yeah, but it doesn’t feel the same when I can’t see them in person.” <br />
<br />
For most of the ride, Holly kept texting her close friends, as she was updating them on how the moving situation was going. Even though she was still in contact with them, she already missed the fun times that they had with her. That peace was broken when her dad went through a speed bump and it caused Daniel’s kiddy tablet to drop from his hands and went to the seating floor. This made Daniel cry as he couldn’t reach the tablet from the floor, since he was attached to the booster seat. “It’s okay, Daniel. I’ll get it.” She reached out to the bottom of her baby brother’s seat, only to find that the tablet’s screen was busted when she picked it up. <br />
<br />
“Oh god no.” Holly worried. “What’s wrong Holly?” Skyler asked. “Daniel’s tablet screen is busted.” Holly was concerned. “Okay, then give him your phone.” She responded. “No, I’m not going to give him my phone.” Holly pouted. “Why is that?” “Because I’m already using it to text my friends.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you texting your friends isn’t going to stop your brother’s crying. Now give him your phone or I’m going to take it away from you.” Skyler demanded. “Alright, I’ll do it.” She then gave Daniel her phone, where it was set to an app that was made for toddlers. Daniel giggled at the cartoons he saw, which was more appealing to the family than his crying. <br />
<br />
After a while, they finally went to the Cuyawayne County line where they saw a “Welcome to Cuyawayne” sign. The parents were already excited as they awaited to start a new chapter with their lives. As they went towards the sign, Holly heard a wet fart that came from Daniel. He had a somewhat relaxed face as he started to grunt and began to push out his breakfast that he had earlier from the diner just a few hours ago.<br />
<br />
He felt a warm poopy log pushed its way past his butt cheeks and fill the empty available space in his diaper. As he was a toddler, he felt comfortable having his business in his diapers since it always felt normal to him. Each passing second of his bowel movement, his diaper became heavier with his doodie. After several seconds, the brown solid was pressing and mushing slightly against his bottom, with the entirety of the poo now completely contained inside the crinkly garment.<br />
<br />
“Eww Daniel, you stink.” Holly holds her nose from the stink before she opened up a window from her seat. Daniel continued to watch his show on Holly’s phone, as he’s used to having warm loads in his diaper. Soon after, he wetted his diaper onto his already messy diaper, which he didn’t mind because that was also normal to him. He didn’t have felt that uncomfortable in his full diaper because he was wearing a Lambies disposable diaper, which was more absorbent than other brands.<br />
<br />
“Can we please stop at a gas station or something?” Holly still plugged his nose. “No, we’re almost at our new house.” Her mother responded. After a few minutes, they arrived in their new neighborhood at Deerville, which was in the suburbs of Cuyawayne. “We’re here.” Jesse said as he and his wife were excited. Holly couldn’t really care less given that she was disappointed. <br />
<br />
As they parked their car into the new garage, Holly thought it would be best to stay inside until her parents needed her help to move in some of their boxes from their rental trailer. But her parents had other ideas.</p>
