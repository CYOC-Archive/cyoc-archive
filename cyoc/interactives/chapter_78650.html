<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually we got up, and Veronica and I led Meagan to our bedroom, where she snuggled in between us. We were <br />
all rather exhausted, so nothing beyond a little stroking or kissing happened before we passed out, surrounded <br />
by the scents of our lovers.<br />
<br />
Veronica and I woke up as the light filtered into our bedroom. Meagan was nowhere to be seen, but we could <br />
smell the mouth-watering aroma of eggs, steak, and bacon wafting into our noses. Veronica and I snuggled <br />
closer together and nuzzled a bit. We were getting set to get up when Meagan walked in with plates and <br />
silverware.<br />
<br />
“Breakfast in bed?” she asked with a smile before passing us each one and saying “Scoot over,” as she crawled <br />
somewhat clumsily up the foot of the bed to wriggle her way in between us, all the while balancing her own <br />
breakfast in one hand. “Sorry..I hope I wasn't over extending my welcome. I just..I woke up and I was SO <br />
hungry..” she said.<br />
<br />
“No dear, that's perfectly fine,” Veronica told her. “The change burns a massive amount of calories. You fully <br />
transformed twice in a few hours.”<br />
<br />
Meagan giggled, “Lycanthropy: your window to weight loss.”<br />
<br />
Veronica nodded. “You laugh, but yes. It takes some time, but you'll start to notice that your body is <br />
changing, even when you're human. Some of those pounds are going to disappear, and you'll find that your tits <br />
are getting bigger. Not massively...but you're what? A B-Cup? You'll go into high-C by this time next year. <br />
It's all the new hormones and chemicals that your body is starting to produce that cause that..and your <br />
metabolism will start to naturally get faster too. While you're probably never going to be what someone would <br />
call 'petite', in a year, you'll have a solidly athletic body.”<br />
<br />
Meagan smiled widely. “Awesome.”  We all continued to scarf down her incredibly satisfying breakfast, with <br />
Meagan continuing to somehow eat and keep a steady stream of questions flying at us, which I tended to let <br />
Veronica answer. First off, I was REALLY hungry, secondly, I was still mostly clueless about the way things <br />
were, though my brain was starting to fill in the blanks about our nature.<br />
<br />
“So obviously, I don't need the full moon,” Meagan said with a satisfied grin, “So I can change like..whenever <br />
I want?”<br />
<br />
Veronica shook her head. “Well, mostly. Many of us have a problem shifting when we're in bright sunlight, <br />
though that can be overcome. The only time that you could say we're truly unable to shift is during the three <br />
days that precede a full moon's rise.”<br />
<br />
“That seems counter-intuitive, almost,” I mused as I gnawed on a piece of steak.<br />
<br />
“Not when you think about it,” Veronica said. “The added height and mass our bodies gain is doubled during a <br />
full moon. Preventing a change during the day keeps our bodies from burning too much fuel, and also prevents a <br />
completely instinctual werewolf from running rampant in the streets. Even in our standard forms, we can do <br />
damage; in our uncontrolled  and boosted forms, we are a terror to behold.”<br />
<br />
Meagan nodded. “Okay, check. If a full moon's gonna happen, I'm stuck in girl form.”<br />
<br />
“You'll also find that changing more than once every few hours..each transformation becomes progressively more <br />
difficult. While Joe and I are able to shift at will under virtually every circumstance, very few other <br />
werewolves are,” Veronica informed her.<br />
<br />
“So why? I mean, once you know how to control it, what's stopping us from doing it whenever we want?” Meagan <br />
asked, once again giving the cocked-head look of mild confusion and intense curiosity.<br />
<br />
Veronica smiled, both in mild amusement at Meagan's unguarded look of curiosity and at the question itself. <br />
“Well, though some werewolves will give you some long-winded mystical philosophy of how why the moon makes us <br />
shift, and what exactly is going on when you shift, the mechanics of the transformation itself can be easily <br />
explained.”<br />
<br />
Veronica put her plate down, and turned her full attention to Meagan. “Lycanthropy is similar to an infection, <br />
or a virus, except this one actually rewrites your genetic code. While you're not gaining extra organs or <br />
limbs, it mutates your adrenal system in particular, though most of your glands are affected as well, and they <br />
start to produce modified chemicals and enzymes. These enzymes are constantly circulating through your system, <br />
but at a low level. Now, when your adrenalin starts to spike, your adrenal glands start pumping out more and <br />
more of this stuff into your system. The more you get running through you, the more your other systems start <br />
to become affected by it. When you reach a sort of 'critical mass' with it,  you shift. The thing is that once <br />
you revert, your body is prepared for a shock..just like how you get scared by the first moment in a horror <br />
movie, but you rarely scream as loud at the second, because you're waiting for it. So the next time you want <br />
to shift, you have to push it harder, until your body resets.”<br />
<br />
Meagan grinned, “That didn't seem to stop me last night.”<br />
<br />
Veronica laughed. “No, it certainly didn't. Last night was a little complicated. First off, your initial <br />
transformation was from the infection taking hold. That's standard. Everyone changes within minutes of <br />
infection. And the second time...we all had a little help. Those drinks had a plant extract in them called <br />
Damiana. It's an aphrodesiac, and it also causes a rather heavy increase in your heart rate, which normally <br />
also causes an increase in adrenal production. To put it mildly, what happened last night was inevitable, <br />
particularly for you once you'd polished off your third glass.”<br />
<br />
“You drugged me??” Meagan said, sounding mildly outraged.<br />
<br />
Veronica laughed, “I drugged all of us. And honestly, I don't think you did anything you didn't want to. I <br />
just made certain things a little..easier.” I wasn't sure how to feel about that, honestly. Veronica continued <br />
to have a certain edge to her, a hunger for control and power that I might have to keep an eye on.<br />
<br />
“Well..I'm not really complaining,” Meagan said. “But you didn't have to drug me..I mean..just regular old <br />
alcohol is pretty much a great way to get my mind into the gutter.” There was a pause as she gave both of us a <br />
mischievous grin. “So..is pack life always going to be this intimate, or was this a one-time welcome to <br />
werewolfiness special?”<br />
<br />
Veronica and I exchanged a glance. Both of us had the same look on our faces-the “one eyebrow raised <br />
suggestively” look. “Well,” she said, “We all did officially claim each other last night.” She traced a finger <br />
from Meagan's bellybutton slowly up and in between her breasts. “And clearly..all of us have an attraction to <br />
each other, even when the change isn't upon us.” She traced the finger along Meagan's collarbone and up her <br />
neck. “And this house..well, there's several extra bedrooms, so we certainly have enough space here.”<br />
Veronica looked over at me. “So what do you say, my love? Can we keep her?” She widened her eyes theatrically <br />
at me and batted her lashes.  <br />
<br />
Meagan beamed and turned her head to look at me, imitating Veronica's big-eyed gaze. “Yeah, can we keep me?” <br />
She then leaned over and laid her head on my chest and stared up at me. “I really..really want to be kept..”<br />
<br />
I smiled; the decision was easy. It felt natural, and had more to do with my new nature than anything <br />
blatantly sex-fueled. She was my packmate, and as her alpha, it was part of my duty to protect her. Meagan <br />
living here made that protection infinitely easier.<br />
<br />
“How can I turn down my two favorite girls?” I asked, getting a squeal of happiness from Meagan, along with a <br />
tight hug. Veronica joined us, turning it into a group hug not unlike the one we'd shared in the club.<br />
<br />
And just like that, I'd gone from being a normal guy one day to a werewolf with a new pack, in addition to an <br />
army that would be reporting to myself and Veronica that night.</p>
