<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You saw your father weeping, and you saw the tears flowing down his face. You remember when you were young your father conditioned you to despise dragons as well, but now that you were one.... things in you mind just seemed more gray than black and white. He told you when you were young that a dragon killed your mother, when you were only around 3 years old in fact, and your little sister was only a year old. It was traumatic just to hear about it then, but now.... seeing your father reduced to a broken man like this was just.... disheartening.... you tried your hardest not to cry as well.<br />
<br />
Soon afterwards the royal guards flocked in to answer your father’s call, but they all just stopped on the edges of the throne room and stared. They all must be conflicted based on what they were witnessing. On one hand, you were a beast that your father tried to vanquish and were a threat to the kingdom, but on the other you knew that these knights heard and/or witnessed your rape before you slaughtered one of the greatest threats to your homeland, and knew that you were royalty despite everything that happened. Even the captain of the guard was stunned, and barely moved an inch.<br />
<br />
What should you do, leave and be written off as an enemy to the kingdom? You know there were many that loved you, and such an act could cause anarchy between the people. Should you stay, and take your chances, despite knowing what you were? The guard after numerous attacks were diminished, and the kingdom was in no shape to defend itself against an assault, but would the people accept you as what you were now?<br />
<br />
Just as you were about to make a decision you heard a familiar voice call out,&quot;Daddy!!&quot; You perked up and watched your sister break through the line of guards and dash up to your father, and you. Your eyes shot wide, did she witness what happened? Did she think you were a monster just like your father?<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy please....&quot; Your sister ran up to him with tears in her eyes before collapsing to her knees in front of him and grabbing his shoulders and sobbed,&quot;D-Don’t m-make us lose another, we already lost mother, so please don’t make me lose my brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
You noticed a few guards urge forwards before the captain with a single gesture ordered them back, and the royal guard maintained their stance. You couldn’t believe your sister would do this, to have the bravery to run out in front of a dragon, in the middle of a battlefield instead of allowing the guards to keep her safe underground. You gritted your teeth and started to quiver, and you whimpered before allowing your tears to roll down your cheeks.<br />
<br />
You started crying as well then and there, your sister was begging and pleading for your safety for your protection, even though you were like this. You couldn’t take this much more, you couldn’t hold it in so you opened your wings and gave a heavy flap and took to the air and made your way to the borders of the kingdom. Once out of sight and alone enough from your father and sister you let out a roar of sorrow before shoving your face into the ground and started crying your heart out.<br />
<br />
You were always taught that you shouldn’t cry, but seeing your father and your own sister like that was just too much. Plus there was the fact that you had become the very thing you were taught to hate and raped during and after before you sank your teeth and claws into the one responsible. You couldn’t take it and clenched your head wallowing in your own pain and sorrow, punching the ground angry at yourself for everything that happened to you.<br />
<br />
By the time you managed to get it together, you decided to just guard the perimeter of the kingdom, and whatever came to you from your home, whether it be a legion of guards sent to slay you, or own father coming to apologize and accept you as his own. But right now you were just a beast, one that pisses and shits in the wild, one that is known to destroy entire kingdoms, and one that raped innocent people and made them into things like you. You were a threat to your own people who you’ve risked your own life to protect time and time again, but now everything wasn’t just black or white anymore just gray and it was so confusing.<br />
<br />
Hours passed, midday turned to dusk, and you had gathered yourself and now sat in front of the castle gates with your tail curled over your front claws. Eventually you were greeted to the sound of clipping and clanking, and turning around you saw the captain of the royal guard and a platoon of soldiers traveling towards you. Sighing you turned around and looked down at them and asked,&quot;Is it time for me to meet god, or am I going to the devil for what I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
The captain and the guard stopped and formed a line just behind you and you tilted your head at this. The captain then dismounted from his horse and approached you on foot, and you leaned down to look at him at eye level. You were the size of the keep inside of your castle and pictured that these soldiers would be sent to kill you, but their stance suggested otherwise.<br />
<br />
The captain took a deep breath and opened a scroll, turning it towards you and saying,&quot;Your father wants to extend his most grievous of apologies, and he wishes for you to return, Princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Princess.....? I-I..... a-apologies I-I.... just...&quot; You  were shocked beyond belief and the captain replied,&quot;Are you not of royal blood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Well.....&quot; You looked down at your body,&quot;I-I guess perhaps at least half, I am still myself after all.... b-but the destruction to the kingdom when..... IT.... took advantage of me.... and our carnage before I took its life.... I-I don’t think I am even fit to enter our kingdom’s borders, and am far too big to do so without unintentionally causing some sort of destruction....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your father wishes to discuss the terms of your return in an old part of the kingdom he condemned when your mother was killed. It is under repair and reconstruction but it is large enough for you, and your father wants you to call it your.... den if you will.&quot; The captain replied and you tilted your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.... pardon me but our kingdom has no such corridors large enough to support someone as large as me.&quot; You replied,&quot;Our kingdom is suspended over a cliffside as well, where would such a place even exist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why over the edge of the cliff of course, the old dragon’s barracks,&quot; The captain replied and your eyes widened,&quot;F-Father never mentioned such a place to me....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The king sought no reason to tell you, there is a cave large enough for you to land in and it has remained stable and was reinforced when at one time. Our history does state that at one point we had an old guardian dragon, however this dragon was killed in battle during your great grandfather’s reign. There are men currently at work to unearth the passage for us humans to access it, please, go there, settle in as much as you can, your father shall be with you as soon as you can. We shall take your place on watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused feeling your eyes tearing up again, but you wiped them away and nodded,&quot;Y-Yes.... and..... th-thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then opened your wings and took off once more and started to scale the cliff off the edge of the kingdom. You spotted the cave beneath the kingdom and it was right under your castle and you landed inside of the mouth, barely making it in and even tumbling a bit and snarling and standing up. &quot;Grrrgh.... Damn wings, how come I can fly so easily when I’m in distress, but when flying normally I land as smoothly as a horse’s shit?&quot; You growled before peering around the room. You could see that this place was built out of an existing cave, but the place did look old. There was a large nest in the rear corner of the cave, and many of the supporting walls looked old and slowly crumbling, and apart from a few abandoned armor stands there was just dust everywhere. <br />
<br />
You figured out about the dust when you started sniffing around but ended up sneezing up a plume of flames. &quot;A-Aack!! Damnit....!&quot; You growled before opening your wings and flapping them a few times, using the wind from your wings to push a good amount of the dust out. Despite basically making a cloud of dust, the cave was much more cleaner and you sighed before looking over at the nest. &quot;Am I really going to sleep in one of these?&quot; You sighed and saw that a lot of the wood was rotting and there was parts of it that had mold on it. Naturally you pushed the nest out and over the edge of the cliff outside of the cave and sighed,&quot;At least this place feels clean now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You walked over on all fours and sat down in the corner where the nest was, crossing your legs and looking down at your body. You started wondering what kind of tastes your rapist had, since you had the thick thighs of a tavern wench, and the plump ass of one too. Then of course there was the plump womanly folds between your legs. You flashed back to the moment that dragon abused you, how he thrusted his meat into your virgin pussy and what came after that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope to god I’m not pregnant with that thing’s vile seed, I don’t deserve something like that, not now,&quot; You growled to yourself before looking outside and seeing the sun set over the horizon. At least that was one luxury you had with this new life, being able to see the sun set over the horizon was actually quite beautiful and comforting.<br />
<br />
You let out a small sigh of contentment before you heard the sound of a rusted door screeching open, and gazing over towards the sound you saw a guard opening the door. It was nobody special you felt, but the person behind him made your heart almost leap up into your chest. It was your sister, and upon seeing you she ran out to you, and you immediately got down on all fours and approached her,&quot;V-Valorie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nathan!&quot; Your sister cheered before tripping two feet in front of you, but luckily you managed to catch her using your snout. &quot;Careful down here, this place hasn’t been cleaned in god knows how long. You’ll ruin your dress if you fall over onto this, and god forbid you cut yourself,&quot; You whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, since when were you the considerate type towards me?&quot; She giggled then hugged your snout and rubbed your cheek,&quot;I love you brother,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I wouldn’t exactly call me a brother now.... even though my chest is flat my..... manhood is gone.... I’m as feminine as you are dear sister, but as a dragon and not human,&quot; You replied laying down on your side, and watched her look down at your voluptuous thighs and crotch, and allow her examine every other part of your body with her eyes from where she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.... I’ve always wanted an older sister, and wanted to know what it was like,&quot; Valorie laughed and you blushed,&quot;S-Sister....&quot;<br />
<br />
You then looked up and noticed your father making his way into the room and your face turned white as you thought back to what he said. &quot;F-Father....&quot; You muttered as you stared at him, curious as to what he might do. Valorie noticed the slight fear in your eyes and rubbed your snout,&quot;It’s okay sister, trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly nodded and took a deep breath and before looking over at your father. Your father walked up to you silently and slowly reached his hand out, placing it on the tip of your snout and rubbing it before walking around and caressing his hand across your face, down your neck and all the way to your wings before he turned around and sighed,&quot;I’m sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Father.... I-I....&quot; You muttered looking back at him and he walked up to your head and said,&quot;I let the past cloud my judgement... forgetting what kind of person you were Nathan..... and no matter what form you take, you’ll always be my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Father...&quot; You started to tear up,&quot;I-I’m n-not a man.... a-anymore. If anything just..... call me your daughter, or... half-daughter....&quot; You sighed thinking back to that moment again.<br />
<br />
Your father looked at the guard and your sister once he saw the look on your face,&quot;Valorie, go to bed sweetheart, have this guard escort you. I need to speak to your sister alone.&quot; Valorie paused then slowly nodded and walked over to the door, and she soon left with the guard. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile your father walked over to the area on your neck where he tried to bury his sword into you. &quot;Thank.... thank the lord your scales are tougher than steel. You barely show a scratch on them...&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Father I..... I forgive you... the day mother died.... affected me too.... I decided to stay and die rather than run away, face my fears... accept my death to make you proud... b-but...... you..... nevermind.&quot; You replied then sighed,&quot;Plus I’m... h-haunted by what that dragon did to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Firstly, thank you.... I couldn’t bear to think of carrying that out in it’s entirety. When the blade struck you and I saw your eyes close.... I wasn’t burying my blade into a beast..... but my Nobel loyal son.....&quot; You noticed the way he clenched his fist, trembling,&quot;I-If my blade would’ve pierced you..... I would’ve thrown myself off of the watchtower overlooking the whole kingdom...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dad.... I.... It’s okay.... let’s forget about it.... we both acted on impulse... and didn’t truly want what we were saying....&quot; You replied,&quot;I will still protect this kingdom until the day I die.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-Thank you for your commitment, but.... let’s move on from this. I did not witness your... abuse let’s call it, from that beast until you were sinking your teeth into its throat,&quot; Your father stated and you slowly nodded, starting to tear up and think back to the moment when you had your virginity taken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Instead of making you describe how it was.... I’ll just ask, did he.... plant his seed in you?&quot; Your father asked and you nodded and whimpered,&quot;I-I was s-scared.... not sure what was even happening... b-but as soon as.... that happened.... everything just went... red and I retaliated as soon as I could. The thought of that.... thing’s spawn.... in me just.... infuriates me. If you want I’ll throw the eggs off of the cliff if it comes to that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father shook his head and you paused,&quot;W-What....?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even I would make a mother do such a thing.... if you do that, it is your choice, if you find a benevolent male who treats you well, then you may bring him here and allow him to give you even more spawn. I’ll allow you the choice of your own spouse, and if you do choose to keep the eggs inside of you, we shall train your young to fight for the kingdom, if that is okay,&quot; Your father exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dad I....&quot; You muttered<br />
<br />
&quot;Today I leaned that you are strong, and that you are responsible enough to control your own life. You cannot be the heir to my throne, and you have accepted that like proper royalty. I will allow you to serve and protect the kingdom as you wish, but if you truly end up pregnant then I wish for you to stay here and rest.&quot; Your father explained and you nodded to him, crying a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-Thank you..... I-I love you....&quot; You whimpered before gently picking him up in your claws and holding him to your chest.<br />
<br />
He nodded and said,&quot;I love you too, my princess, now I’ll leave you to personalize your new home as you see fit there will be guards and builders coming in and out to restore this place to its former glory for you. I trust that your instincts will help you make your choices, and if you think you are always welcome here... many are going to have to get used to having a friendly dragoness around here now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and giggled a bit,&quot;I-I guess it c-could be worse too... I remember all the times Valorie complained about her breasts whenever she hit puberty, and I don’t have any. Not very ladylike but I trust that she can become a nice Queen someday. I doubt I’ll get used to the empty feeling of my nethers though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father chuckled at that and you set him back down on the ground as you wiped your tears. Your father smiled up at you and said,&quot;You make a fine woman as well as a man, if only you had a more fitting name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Natalie? I don’t feel comfortable taking up a draconic name, plus it’ll just be a reminder to everyone that I was human.... right?&quot; You replied and smiled,&quot;I think I might just want to rest here tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father nodded and said,&quot;Goodnight then Natalie, my fair daughter,&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and curled up like a dog, laying your head between your legs for warmth, curling your tail around you, and covering your body with your wings. You heard the footsteps of your father walk away, and the screech of the door close as you started drifting off. Eventually you managed to get yourself to sleep on the ground of the old cave. The next day you planned to try your best to get used to this body... make a nest... but which came first whenever the sun rose over the horizons?</p>
