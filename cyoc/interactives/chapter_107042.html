<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally kept on looking at herself and was amazed by the fact that this program can turn her into an actual human.  Turning to the full-length mirror, she observed every detail and couldn’t help but to feel more…  Free…  Turning to the computer, she could see the program still on, waiting for the next response.  She soon approaches the computer and took a seat to get a good look at this Chronivac, beginning to skim through the options.  Jeff looked to her and was amazed that she’s adjusting to being a human so well.  But she was curious on what she’s doing and asked her about it.<br />
<br />
“So…” he started, “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
Sally looked through the site while answering back, “Oh…  I’m just checking through this program.  Now this program can let you turn anything and anyone into whatever you want?”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked and answered a little nervously.  “Okay…  And why would you be so interested in this?”<br />
<br />
Sally kept looking through the site and found the animal transformation package.  Looking through the options, she turned to him and asked, “You used this program to turn me into a human.  Can it turn a human into a dog as well?”<br />
<br />
Jeff raised an eyebrow and said back, “Yeah…  Why are you so interested in that?”<br />
<br />
Sally then turned to him and crossed her legs in a womanly manner, telling him her idea.  “Well, since you gave me a chance in becoming a human, I do believe I wish to return the favor.”<br />
<br />
“And what favor are you talking about?” Jeff asked, getting more curious.<br />
<br />
That’s when Sally asked an important question.  “Well, ever wonder what it’s like to be a dog yourself?”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that and was a little quiet by that question.  But thinking back, he always wondered how Sally thought to be a dog.  Dogs don’t have to worry about school, or work, or getting married.  They have a lax and simple life.  He always wished what it will be like to in their shoes, or paws for that matter.  So looking to his former pet, he said in a straight answer, “You know…  I’ve always wondered what it would be like to be a pet of someone.  What do you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
Sally gave a quick smirk and told him of her plan.  “Well…” she started to explain, “I was thinking that since you want me to sped some time as a human, maybe you should spend time as a dog yourself.”<br />
<br />
That really got Jeff as he rubbed his chin and thought of her plan.  “Hmm…” he thought, “Switching places with Sally?  Sounds very intriguing.  Still, I’m a little concerned about the fact about me turning into a dog.  What if my family finds out that I’m missing?”<br />
<br />
Sally waved it off and said, “No worries…  You managed to select the option of turning me back; I’ll do the same with you as well.  That way, when your family arrived, we’ll switch back and pretend that nothing ever happened.  Who knows, maybe we’ll keep doing that from time to time when no one is around.  Or better yet, we can keep it permanent and live newer lives together.  After all, the Chronivac does give us a chance to live a better life.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard her and was intrigued with her plan.  To change him to a dog and have the option for Sally and change him back manually sounds like a good idea on paper.  But it depends on what they are going to do.  It would be a risk, but it’s the chance they have to take.  “All right then, let’s get started.” He said with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Sally gave a warm smile and turn to the computer to get started to work.  “All right,” she said at the ready, “let’s get started!”<br />
<br />
She started to get into the animal package and typed down the information necessary.  She started by typing down Jeff’s name followed by his age, and then moving on to setting the mental changes and awareness on to make sure he knows he’s changing, next is to set the reality change off so Jeff’s world won’t alter to something similar to his canine self, and then moving on ahead with setting the time to ten minutes and leaving the option of changing Jeff back manually.  Jeff watched her go and was amazed that her knowledge in working on computers became advanced when he gave her the mental change option.  It’s almost like she was human in the first place.  Though she’s still naked since the change, she’s behaving normally in these types of conditions.  So it’s nice to note that she was getting comfortable with her new look.  He wondered if what he did was good or bad.  That will depend when the day continues.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jeff?” Sally asked, “Can you help me with something?”<br />
<br />
Jeff got out of his trance and headed to her to see what she wants.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what is it?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I put up all the information necessary for the program, but I left the animal section blank.  At first, I want to type dog, but I’m certain they would ask for a certain type of breed.  Can you help me with that?” Sally explained.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to the program and noticed the section where the animal Jeff would change into was blank.  Seeing this, he scratched the back of his head and wondered what dog he can turn himself into.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…  Let’s see…” Jeff wondered.  Just then, he came up with an idea and said, “Oh!  Why don’t you turn me into a Labrador Retriever?”<br />
<br />
Sally turned to him with and raised eyebrow and asked, “Labrador Retriever?  Why would you pick that?”<br />
<br />
“Because they are the most popular breeds along with the most loyal.” Jeff said, “Not to mention every girl would have a Labrador as a pet.  It would be perfect for you.”<br />
<br />
Sally listened to him and smiled in hearing something like that.  “Sounds perfect!” she said as she typed Labrador retriever down.  Once she’s done with that, she looked through the remaining options and was ready.  “Okay…  Looks like we’re ready to begin.”<br />
<br />
She was about to push start on the computer, but before she could do that…<br />
<br />
“Wait!” screamed Jeff.<br />
<br />
Sally turned around and asked, “What is it?  Did you forget something?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to her and said, “Something like that.  Just give me a second.”<br />
<br />
Hurrying to the bed, he sat down and did something unexpected.  He was taking off his clothes in front of a woman who was once a dog.  He started to take off his shoes, then socks, then pants, and shirt until he was in his underwear.  By the time he removed that, he was completely naked and was looking at Sally.  “I can’t transform with my clothes on, it would make a serious mess.”<br />
<br />
Sally looked to the teen and was amazed by how he looked naked.  Sure he was a bit lanky with some muscles on his arms and legs and his chest is a little poked out, but to see his limp penis like that got her a little turned on.  Jeff could see her biting her lip and said, “Hey!  Don’t get any funny ideas missy.  You might be a woman now, but you are still a dog on the inside.”<br />
<br />
Sally gave a bit of a sigh and decided to start.  “Yes…  Yes…  I got it.  I don’t want to have sex when you turn into a dog.  Still, might be interesting to see what having sex is like as a human.”<br />
<br />
“That will be for another time, one that would be until you get use to this human life slowly.  Now shall we begin?” Jeff finished.<br />
<br />
Sally smiled as she moved the mouse pointer to the start button.  “I thought you never asked.” She said as she hit the button and the window appeared initiating the change.<br />
<br />
Once the changes start, Sally turned to see a naked Jeff waiting for something to happen.  So far, she didn’t see much of the changes.  Sally got curious and asked Jeff, “Well…  Anything…”<br />
<br />
Jeff tried feel something, but didn’t get much.  “No…” he said, “I not feeling anything.  Are you sure you got everything down?”<br />
<br />
Sally checked the computer and could see that it started.  “I do believe I got everything together.” she said with confusion, “Maybe there’s a bit of a delay in the changes, like what I had to go through moments ago.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it better happen soon.  Because I don’t want to be naked in this room for-“ before he could finish, he felt a tingle in his stomach.  That tingling soon spread all over his body through his head to toes and the tips of his fingers.  Sally saw this and asked, “Jeff?  Are you all right?  You don’t look too good.”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a little lightheaded as he was trying to gain some balance. “I don’t know…” he said feeling very strange, “I fell like I’m getting sick or something.  I guess the changes are starting.  Don’t know how this will work though.”<br />
<br />
Sally looked to his naked body and wondered where it was going to start.  But then, she spotted something and pointed to it, saying, “Jeff!  Look at your feet!  They’ve starting to change!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to her with confusion until he looked down to see his feet.  When he did, he was amazed at the metamorphosis.  First, his toenails grew pointy and sharp as the color darkened into solid black, forming claws.  Then, his big toe grew smaller and slowly migrated to the back while the other toes cracked and shifted into canine like toes.  During mid migration, he could feel his heels lifting up by themselves and stretching to inhuman proportions.  He could hear the bones cracking during the changes, but he didn’t feel pain, only pure enjoyment.  Soon enough, his heel was high enough while his former big toe shrunk and migrated to the back and became nonexistent.  The skin on the deformed feet then thick dark brown hairs, the same color as his head of hair, and deepened into fur.  Now, what were his human feet has now become a pair of dog feet of a Doberman.<br />
<br />
Sally looked on in delight and was surprised at the start of the change.  “Well now,” she said with interest, “looks like the changes are starting with your feet and moving up to your head.  I could already see the fur slowing spreading up your legs.”  Jeff lifted up one of his dog feet and marveled at the fur spreading up his leg while his muscles and bones shrank and shifted into that of a dog’s proportion.  “I know, right?” said Jeff feeling excited. “It’s almost surreal, but yet at the same time comforting.  Though I am wondering about what other changes you made with the Chronivac.  Are there any other options you’ve made?’<br />
<br />
By the time he asked that, the fur slowly made it up his knees and began another drastic change.  He could feel his bones popping and cracking as the knees themselves slowly reversed directions turning into hind legs of a dog.  Jeff could feel himself loosing balance, but stood upright like a normal human.  It was obvious he will remain standing, as the rest of the body is human, for now.  Sally saw the changes as she explained a few more things.  “Well for one, I did set the mental changes on.  That means that all of your human memories will be wiped out and replaced with memories of a dog.  But I did set the awareness on so you can still remember you were turned into a human.  Just like what you did with me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to look at the mirror and felt the way he’s standing, with his dog like hind legs on his human body.  He watched in fascination as the fur spread up to his thighs watch the muscle mass melted away into that of a dog.  “Hmm…  So I’m going to be a dog both physically and mentally, but remembered being turned into a dog.” He said thinking it through.  “That’s the point…” Sally said, “And since I still have my dog memories, I will know what you want when you are completely turned.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to her as the fur moved up his hips, leaving his legs to be turned completely into that of a dog.  “Well at least I have someone who understands what a dog does for a living.  After all, you were once one and you know a thing to two about…  Ohh…  Urgh…” he cut short as he felt a little warm on his nether regions.  Sally looked to him as he lay back on the side of the bed feeling really aroused.  “Are you okay, Jeff?” she asked a little confused.  Jeff waved it off and said, “I’m fine…  I’m just feeling a little woozy, almost like I’m in some kind of heat.”  Sally could see that he was sweating and knew what he’s going through right now.  It is the dog’s equivalent of masturbation.  Looking down to his lower area, she could see his penis slowly erecting and stiffening.  She felt aroused herself as her nipples poked out and was turned on.  “You’re certainly in heat.” She said in arousment, “You’re privates proves your going through the next phase of the changes.”<br />
<br />
Jeff panted heavily as the changes escalated up to dick.  The fur spread up to his balls while the little pubic hair he had thinned and detach from his skin, floating downwards to the floor.  Soon enough, the dark brown fur covered his balls completely while rest went around his penis, leaving his shaft completely bare.  Jeff left like he needed a release as he wrapped his hand around his erected dick and stoked it back and forth.  As he was stroking it, his penis started to change as well.  It started to get longer as the mushroom tip compressed and merged together with the skin and grew pointy.  The skin then darkens and turned into a red like color.  Soon what was a human shaft has now become a dog’s shaft as Jeff was masturbating to himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff was nearing reaching his orgasm while Sally watched in sheer pleasure to see Jeff’s privates turned into that of a dog.  If it were up to her, she would’ve have Jeff have sex with her.  But Jeff was turning into a dog and she is now human.  Even if she wants to have sex, the cross breeding of species, especially between a human and dog, would be very weird.  Maybe one day she would experiment with that feeling.  But until then, she’ll enjoy the show that’s before her.  Jeff soon screamed as he started to spew up cum from the tip of his dog dick.  He soon took a deep breather after his self-orgy as the dog dick went limp as the foreskin grew in and sucked the shrinking dick until it was covered completely.  Taking his final breath, he looked to Sally and said in the tiredness in his voice, “Wow…  That was something unexpected.  I didn’t think a canine masturbation would be this intense.”  Sally laughed on that joke as she said, “You think that was intense?  Just wait until you make out with a female dog.  I should know, I had some experience with that.”  Jeff turned to her and was a little shocked.  “You had sex with male dogs before you became human?” he asked in surprise, “I just hope you don’t have puppies in your womb.”  Sally shrugged her shoulders as she said, “No…  The dogs that make out with me were spayed and neutered.  I don’t think that they have the sperm necessary to create new puppies.”  Jeff smiled, as he was relieved that she wasn’t pregnant.  Because if she was turned human, who knows how many former puppies were in that womb of hers.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt his back aching as the fur spread up his rear as the spin popped and snapped bit by bit.  Trying to stand straight up, he could see in the mirror that he was slouching further, lowering his body in each pop.  He tried to stand up straight, but his body refused is as he kept on getting lower and lower.  Knowing this, he had no choice but to accept it as he placed his hands on the floor, now standing on four instead of two.  Jeff looked around and noticed how different his view was very different then when he was standing.  “Huh…” he said under observation, “So that’s how it feels like being on four legs.  Certainly similar when I was an infant, but very different.”  Sally laughed it off and finds the way he’s feeling very uncomfortable.  “Well, all dogs and other animals has to be on four legs.” She said joking around, “You just need to get use to it.”  Jeff turned to his former pet and argued back, “Says the dog that’s getting use to standing on two legs.”  The two laughed it up as they enjoyed the jokes they share.  But then, Jeff felt something at the base of his spine as another change took place.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned back to see what’s going on, but giving how his lower back has changed, it was impossible to find out what’s going on.  So he asked Sally, “Well, do you see anything changing?”  Sally looked on and spotted something sticking out of his rear.  It looked like a small nub grew out and slowly extending after each pop.  As it continued to grow, dark brown hair grew in to match that of the lower body.  Seeing this, she smirked and said to him, “Looks like you are gaining your new tail.”  Jeff looked to her saying, “What?” before turning his body to the side with his arms and legs on the floor.  Taking a good look at the mirror, he was amazed to see the tail growing on his rear.  As it grew halfway, muscles and nervous systems formed and it caused the tail to swing left and right in happiness.  And Jeff was indeed happy as he sees his own tail growing right before his eyes.  “Whoa…  I have a tail…” he said in sheer excitement, “This is awesome!!!”  He watched as his tail finished growing until it became a fully functional tail.  He waved it back and forth and was really gleeful about it.  Sally looked on as well and was happy to see Jeff getting his tail.  But that was just the beginning as most of his body was human while the while the legs and rear were that of a canine.  However, the fur spread past his hips as it moved down his body.<br />
<br />
The dark brown fur spread from his stomach and back to his chest and upper shoulders he could feel the bones and organs of his body shifting around.  His ribcage compact and barrels out while his shoulder blades compress to make him to move his arms less.  Organs were moving around as they fit to help accommodate that of a dog.  Jeff kept on watching the changes as he now has the body of the dog.  It even looks comical to him when his arms and head were still human.  “This is so surreal.” He said feeling amused, “I mean, this is my body, yet at the same time, it’s unfamiliar.  Like it’s not my own.”  Sally sighed and told him that it was nothing.  “I’m sure you’ll get use to it.  I mean, my body is now human and I’m getting the hang of it.”  Jeff then felt the changes moving to him arms as he watched as the fur creped down on them.<br />
<br />
The fur slowly went down his biceps as the muscles contorted and thinned to canine proportions.  Once the fur reached his elbows, they cracked and shifted into that of a dog.  The fur then moved down his arms and thinned them to fit his new body.  When the fur reached his hands, he looked down to see the changes close up.  First, he could see his nails getting longer and sharper, becoming points as the color of each nail darkened to solid black.  By the time they sharpened into claws, the fingers cracked and pulled in, as they became less dextile.  The thumb then grew small and migrated all the way to the back, becoming invisible like the toe.  Lifting his former hand up, Jeff could see the black padding growing in on the palms while the fur grew down his shifting hands and covered it completely.  When the changes subsided, Jeff could see his hands and arms turned into the front legs and forepaws of a dog.  Jeff tried to flex his doggy digits but they were completely useless.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed, as he knew that he lost the one thing his human side has, the use of his hands.  “And there go my hands…” he said with the aggravation in his voice, “Guess I won’t use my fingers for write, play sports, type, or masturbate.”  Sally gave a giggle until she said something to him.  “Don’t worry Jeff.  This is only temporary, at least until we switch back when your family arrives.  Unless of course you want to be a dog for the rest of your life.”  Jeff looked to her with a glare and said back, “Let’s not jump to conclusions, Sally.  The deal is that we’ll return to our old selves until my family arrives.  If it would be permanent, then it will be how we felt in each other’s body.  So I do believe you should wait and see how you’re human body adds up from your previous one.”<br />
<br />
Sally listened and understood why he didn’t want to jump to conclusion.  These changes were temporary, as she needs to get use to her new body.  If they don’t like their looks, they will return to their normal selves and pretend that it didn’t happen.  But if they want to stay the way they are, it would be up to Jeff to make that said decision.  So she needs to wait and see what he says after a day in each other’s new forms.<br />
<br />
As she was thinking of this, she noticed the sound of Jeff’s voice sounded off.  It almost sounds a little rougher then before and a little animalistic then human.  Taking a good look, she spotted fur slowly going up his neck and nearing his Adam’s apple.  Seeing this, she told him, “Jeff, you voice…  It’s starting to change.”  Jeff could feel it as his vocal cords shifted as those of speech were slowly vanishing.  “You’re right, Sally.” he said as his voice kept on getting rougher, “I can feel it down my throat.  It is reird.  Might be roosing my roice roon.”  And indeed he is loosing his voice as his speech was getting slurred as some words he said had an R sound in them.  Sally smiled as she said to him, “Perhaps a little sooner.  Sounds like your words are rougher and doggier.  At least I set the awareness on so I could understand you and you can understand me.  At least we will get use to what we’re saying.”  Jeff smiled as he tried to make out the words.  “Rank rou, Rally.  I romise rat I’r re re res rariral ar ret ar ara re.”  The last of his words were lost as the vocal cords shifted and he lost his speech completely.  Now all that he can do is bark as he was woofing time to time.  Sally though understands what he said as she said back, “I know will be the best pet.  And I’ll be happy to be your best master temporarily.”  Looking on, Sally could see that Jeff was almost finished as his entire body was dog while his head was still human.  But that will soon change as the last of the transformation started.<br />
<br />
Jeff can feel his head cracking as he whined like a dog now that his voice is gone.  Sally looked on as Jeff closed his eyes in pain, but she knew the head was shifting around.  While the fur was slowly reaching the top of his neck, the changed on the face was evident.  His nose started to darkened and is completely black as it started to get wet.  His senses started to intensify as he could smell everything around him.  Soon enough, his nose grew out and slowly extended as the skull cracked and grew out.  Jeff growled from the pain as he could feel the front of his face extended into muzzle.  His mouth soon joined the ride as his jaw line grew out and extended along with the nose.  He grinned his teeth as new ones grew in and they all grew sharp.  He opened his mouth as he barked as Sally could see his tongue flag and extending out as he was panting.  The muzzle was complete as his face almost had the look of a Labrador.  His ears soon grew pointed and migrated up to the top of his head, before extending further and got floppy.  Then the hair on his head started to fall off in clumps and scattered all over the floor, leaving him completely bald.  The remaining fur grew all over the face until it reached his newly formed muzzle.  Soon enough, Jeff went from being a teenage human being to a fully transformed Labrador.<br />
<br />
Still, the changes weren’t over yet as he could feel a headache in his brain.  What was really happening is that Jeff’s human memories were being wiped out while canine instincts and mannerisms were being added in.  Soon enough, his life got simpler as things like school, a job, and even marriage were long gone as eating, sleeping, playing, and going to the bathroom as a dog was more familiar.  Still, he was aware of the changes as he knew that he was once human and turned into the dog to enjoy what it’s like to be a different species.  Soon enough, the Chronivac completed the changes as the Jeff the dog was panting from the aftermath.<br />
<br />
Sally looked to him and wondered if he was all right.  Getting off the chair, she approached him and bent down to her knee close to his face and asked, “Jeff…?  Are you okay…?  Are you still there?”<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head and looked up to see Sally’s face.  When he opened his eyes, he was surprised that all the color was drained out and he was seeing the world in black and white.  It’s a small price to pay, but at least it’s nice to see in a different perspective.  But he looked to her and could see the worryness in her face.  But then, he responded with a bark of pure delight and pounced on her naked body, with his canine chest and his breasts and licked her face completely.  Sally was caught by surprise by this reaction, but was happy as well as Jeff was enjoying his start of being a dog.  “Ha, ha…” she laughed and said, “I guess I’ll take that as a yes.”  Soon enough, Jeff got off her as she got up remove the slobber off her face.  The two soon looked at the mirror and was amazed at the results of their body.  The former pet and master looked on with smiles as Sally said, “Welcome to the other side of the fence Jeff.  I hope you enjoy your life as much as I will have with mine.”<br />
<br />
She soon looked to herself and realized something.  “You know…” she started to say, “As much as how good I look, I don’t think humans would go around naked all day.”  He soon turned to see the clothes Jeff discarded on the bed and decided to wear them.  “Might as well dress up, since these are the only clothes I can think of.” she said as she approached the bed and puts on Jeff’s clothes.  Jeff looked to her dressing up and was surprised that she knew how to put on clothes to begin with.  But since that he gave her human intelligent, she would know how to do things normal people would do and not act like a dog in human skin.  Once she finished dressing up, she returned to the mirror to see how she looked.  Indeed, she looked ridiculous in male clothing and that it was tight in a few places, but she worked it out to make her look modest.  She even tied the shirt in the middle to show off her mid section and lowered the pants so it was close to her private.  Looking to herself, she gave a cocky grin and said, “Not the best look out there, but it will do.  Unless I take some clothes from your mother, Jeff.  But she’ll be asking where her stuff is.  I’ll figure something out, but until then, let’s enjoy our day together.”  Jeff barked happily as he was ready to start spending his time as a dog temporarily.<br />

Sally soon turned to Jeff and asked in a polite tone, “So…  What should we do with our switched lives?”</p>
