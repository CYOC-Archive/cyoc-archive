<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No one moved from their positions on the floor for a while. Both woman had lost all strength in their bodies after their climaxes and Ben needed time to pull his brain back from over the edge. Diane absentmindedly stroked her engorged tummy as she felt Ben’s ejaculate foam out of her pussy. She felt so content but, as time went on, reality began to dawn on her. She was laying naked on the floor of a barn, next to a client, with a belly inflated to the size of a basketball. Her face, having already been flushed, began to grow redder with her realization. With her lower lip quivering in embarrassment, Diane began to gather her clothes. <br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry, I don’t know what came over me. I should go. Let’s just pretend this never happened,” she begged.<br />
<br />
“Why? Didn’t you enjoy it?” Megan asked as she propped herself up on her elbows. <br />
<br />
Diane froze at Megan’s words. “W-well, I-I-I…” she stammered.<br />
<br />
“Why are you so embarrassed? It’s not like you did anything wrong,” Megan assured. <br />
<br />
Didn’t she? Diane had never done anything like this before. She didn’t do one night stands or random hookups, and she most certainly didn’t have sex with her clients. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. This shouldn’t have happened. I should have had more self control. Please, Ms. Austin, forgive my weak will,” Ben apologized as turned away in shame. <br />
<br />
That act made Diane’s heart ache. “No, please, it was my fault. I don’t know what came over me, please don’t blame yourself,” she pleaded. <br />
<br />
Megan rolled her eyes at the two. “Why don’t you stay for dinner? Ben is a great cook, and we can use the opportunity to talk,” she suggested. Diane was conflicted. She liked the idea of staying, but her professionalism told her it was a bad idea. <br />
<br />
“There were a few things I wanted to ask you. Please consider it. I would love the opportunity to make it up to you,” Ben insisted. Diane’s resolve crumbled as she looked at Ben’s earnest, pleading eyes. <br />
<br />
“Okay,” she weakly agreed and the two smiled at each other, before realizing they were still naked and covering themselves in embarrassment. Megan sighed. Some people take things too seriously. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later, everyone was once again clothed, save for the swollen stomachs of the girls. Diane still had a light blush on her cheeks, but otherwise had calmed down. Ben opened the door for both women and let them enter before him. Megan’s eyes lit up, this being the first time she’d seen the inside of the house. She began rushing around, inspecting and playing with everything. Ben smiled at his fiancé’s childlike wonder before heading into the kitchen. Diane continued to watch the redhead run around the large bottom floor of the house. <br />
<br />
“Meg, I’m not sure why I expected different, but the kitchen is empty,” Ben sheepishly explained. <br />
<br />
“No,” Megan pouted, “we gotta have a nice home cooked meal on our first day. Is there a store nearby?” <br />
<br />
“There’s a town about 15 minutes west from here. It’s easy to find,” Diane informed. <br />
<br />
“In that case, I’ll go to the store and buy us some groceries. You can start unpacking while I’m gone,” Ben offered. <br />
<br />
“Okay,” Megan agreed and kissed Ben before he headed toward the door. Diane stiffened as Ben approached. Her mind began to race and her face began to redden. What was he doing? Did he intend to… Ben walked passed the older woman and opened the front door. <br />
<br />
“I’ll be back as quick as I can,” he called out before closing the door behind him. <br />
<br />
Diane let out a relieved sigh before biting her lower lip in shame. Of course he wasn’t going to kiss her goodbye. They were basically strangers. She crossed her arms under her bust in discomfort. What was she even doing here? She had no place being in this place. She’d completed her current business here. If Ben… if Mr. Kingsly had any more questions, he could call her office. Diane turned to leave when Megan grabbed her arm and dragged her further into the house. <br />
<br />
“Let’s see what the other floors look like,” she squealed. Diane was dragged all over the home. Being forced to explore the kitchen, the massive dining room that more so resembled a cafeteria, several spare bedrooms, another living room, a home gym, and most recently a spa area. <br />
<br />
Megan’s eyes shimmered as she gawked at the massive soaking tub. Diane was surprised by the size and number of lounging chairs in the connecting room to the bath. They had several attachments of unknown purpose and looked to be very expensive. What was the purpose of this house? Was it meant to be a retreat of some kind? A dairy farm resort? That didn’t make any sense. Who would want to go to one of those. But, the music currently playing over the speakers was very relaxing. <br />
<br />
Diane could see herself sitting in the chair, being cared for and pampered. She didn’t notice herself walking towards the nearest chair and planting herself in the over large seat. As soon as she sat down the chair activated and began vibrating. Diane let out a deep sigh as the chair relieved her of the tension she had been carrying in her body. Megan heard Diane’s approving groans and entered the room herself. <br />
<br />
She giggled as she watched Diane’s belly shiver at a different speed from the chair, its swollen, taut mass not allowing for such quick oscillations. The longer the watched, the more she wanted to share in the experience. Sitting in the chair next to Diane, Megan relaxed into the seat as it too activated. Both women were lulled into a blissful state of comfort as a dome lowered over the girls’ heads and a belt wrapped around their belly’s and breasts which too began to vibrate.</p>
