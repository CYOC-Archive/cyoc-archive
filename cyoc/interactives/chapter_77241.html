<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Jack change back and let's go to your place. Just think about being human again.&quot; Russ said.<br />
<br />
Jack stared at Russ and then barked at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! Jack are you still in there?&quot; Russ said in a frightful tone. <br />
<br />
Jack thought about being human again and in mere seconds there was a teenage guy on all fours on the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Scared you there for moment, didn't I.&quot; Jack said in a playful mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do that!&quot; Russ said scornfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess these are garbage now.&quot; Jack said pointing to the hole in his underwear where his tail had just been. <br />
<br />
Both boys got dressed and went to Jack's car. Jack drove them back to his place. They'd have the place to themselves for the weekend while his dad was away on a business trip for the weekend. His mom had left when he was five. She said she couldn't handle being a mother and needed some space. She never did come back. <br />
<br />
The two guys got out of the car and went into Jack's house. They went straight to Jack's room where Jack had a laptop. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know I've been wondering about whether or not we can change into anthros as well.&quot; Russ said turning on Jack's laptop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anthros? What are those?&quot; Jack asked in a curious tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're like a hybrid animal. Part human and part animal but not completely one or the other. Here take a look at this anthro german shepard.&quot; Russ said staring at the laptop's screen. <br />
<br />
Jack looked and saw an anthro german shepard jacking off in a picture. Russ hit back and brought up a picture of two gay anthros going at it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! That's fucking hot.&quot; Jack said.<br />
<br />
Russ stood up and kissed Jack. Jack opened his mouth and let Russ' tongue in. Russ pulled away &quot;Well what are we waiting for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack stripped down to the nude and watched as Russ did the same. Russ had a nice round ass and Jack couldn't help but stare and lick his lips. Both guys closed their eyes and started to focus on becoming an anthro. <br />
<br />
Jack was thinking about the anthro german shepard. Meanwhile Russ was thinking about becoming an anthro husky. Fur kept over the two guy's bodies. Their ears moved on to the top of their heads. Their arms and hands got larger as muscle expanded and developed. The muscle spread down their chest and down to their legs. Nubs appeared above their asses and fur grew on them. Their faces started to push out as muzzles started to appear. Their noses became black. They could smell the lust on each other. <br />
<br />
Their human cocks disappeared into furry sheaths and their balls swelled to the size of grapefruit. They opened their eyes. <br />
<br />
Jack saw a nice looking husky standing before him. The husky had deep ocean blue eyes and a handsome grin on his face. &quot;So how do I look?&quot; asked Russ.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're perfect. Sexy, very sexy,&quot; Jack couldn't help but grin as he said that, &quot;what about me?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sexy as well. Too sexy stud.&quot; Russ said whispering into Jack's ear. <br />
<br />
The two met in an embrace and started to passionately make out. One of Jack's hands found its way down to Russ' sheath where he started to rub it. Russ pulled away and moaned. They both watched in awe as a big canine cock slid out. It slowly slid out to a length of 11 inches and was 5 inches around at the base, of course the knot was not fully expanded yet. Jack's own cock was already out and stood proudly at 13 inches. Russ bent over and took Jack's member into his mouth. Jack let out a whimper. Russ slowly worked that cock in his mouth hitting all the right spots. He came up and whispered something into Jack's ear.<br />
<br />
Jack was shocked but he went to it. He got on his knees and Russ presented his ass to him. Jack took a deep sniff taking in the intoxicating smell. Then he went to work eating Russ' tail hole out. Russ was whimpering like a big puppy. The feeling of a canine tongue sliding in and out of his hole felt wonderful. Then he gasped as he felt something else enter him.<br />
<br />
He turned his head to see that Jack was now standing. Jack had begun to mate him. He started to pant as the pleasure started to intensify. Jack was licking his neck and giving it a quick nibble or two as he worked his big tool in his mate's ass. Then Russ felt something new. A big bulge, which could only mean that Jack was about ready to tie him. PLOP! He let out a howl as the knot slipped into his ass, plugging him, making him and his mate one. Jack whispered into Russ' ear &quot;You like this don't you? I hope your taking notes because after we're done here I want to feel you in my ass.&quot; and then he kiss Russ' neck. Jack quivered as he felt his hot doggy seed shot into his mate's ass. Both guys let out a howl as they came together. <br />
<br />
Russ finally felt Jack's member slip out of his ass after 15 minutes of waiting and spooning. &quot;It's my turn now.&quot; he thought.</p>
