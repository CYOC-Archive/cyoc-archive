<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pierce (Perry) Linklater peered out the cabin window.  At age seven, he had two years on the youngest Scouts here, but he was still one of the shortest.  Being little for his age was frustrating - some people thought he was still in pre-school instead of second grade.  Both his parents were short for grownups, too, and though he didn&#39;t quite understand why, he knew that probably meant he would be small all his life.<br />
<br />
As he stared out into the woods, his eyes widened.  Was something out there?  This side of the cabin faced away from the main camp, so the only thing that would be out there was probably a wild animal.  It was supposed to be safe around the camp, though.  Only deer and rabbits and other nice animals.  No wolves or bears.  Another movement caught his attention and he felt a prickle of excitement.  It was big, whatever it was, way bigger than even Mr. Tucker, the Pack Leader.  A bear?  There weren&#39;t supposed to be any of them out here.  Maybe a big deer?  <br />
<br />
Everyone else was sleeping soundly.  Curious, Perry slipped quietly from the upper bunk and managed to get out the door without waking the others.  It was really late out, and everyone was asleep except for him.  Well, he could hear voices over from where the older kids were camping in tents. It was warm out, and the ground had a cover of soft pine needles, so being outside in only his underpants was comfortable.  He padded around the side of the cabin to the woods and took a few steps into the trees.<br />
<br />
The shape was further away, but Perry saw it moving and the glitter of large, luminous eyes.  It was looking at him!  After a moment, the shape shuffled further into he trees, looking back occasionally.  It wanted him to follow!  Perry glanced at the cabin, knowing he shouldn&#39;t be going off on his own, but there was something about the shape that called to him.  A feeling inside that he was supposed to go into the woods.  After only a moment, he continued, keeping the huge dark shape in sight.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t look like a deer, he decided.  No antlers and way too big.  It moved more like he would expect a bear to shuffle, but the shape didn&#39;t look quite right for that, either.  A few times he thought he had lost it among the trees, only to find it right where he had expected it to be.  It was like it sometimes was there and sometimes wasn&#39;t.  He was so focused on following the shape that he lost track of time and distance.  A stick snapped under his foot, startling him out of the almost daze he had been in.  <br />
<br />
He had gone on a couple of steps before he realized that stepping on a stick in his bare feet should have hurt.  It was hard to make out in the dim moonlight that filtered through the leaves, but the ground here was no longer carpeted in pine needles - sticks, branches, even small rocks littered the path.  That alarmed him at first - how could he get back without shoes?  Then he lifted up a foot in puzzlement and stared at the dark, rough pads on the bottom.  They looked almost like a dog&#39;s, except shaped more for his human foot.  He brushed absently at some pine needles stuck around his ankles and realized it was hair!  Coarse and dark, unlike the fine blonde mop on his head.<br />
<br />
There was a grunt from up ahead - not words but a sound that seemed to call to him.  Feeling a little confused, but still very curious, Perry  continued.  The shape didn&#39;t seem quite so big now, and even the trees were looking smaller.  That didn&#39;t really sink in until he realized his underwear was cutting into his waist and digging harder.  Puzzled, he stopped and forced fingers under the taught elastic.  He had intended to stretch it out a little, but the effort snapped the waistband apart.  Perry gasped at the sudden release of pressure, and stared in dismay as the tattered remains of his only clothing slipped down his hairy legs.  <br />
<br />
Huh?  The long brown strands that he had discovered around his ankles had spread up both legs, still very thin on his thighs, but now a tangled, matted growth lower down that obscured his feet.  And there was more than just the hair.  His legs were longer and thicker, like a big kid&#39;s!  Part of him was scared now, but it was just a little part.  The rest of him wanted to see if he could get bigger.  The dark shape was a little closer now, watching him from about 100 feet away.  It looked a lot sharper than it had before, and he thought he could even smell it.  That as silly.  There was a lot of scents around him, though, way stronger than he had experienced before.  They weren&#39;t bad, just more intense.<br />
<br />
The rumbling sound came again, and it seemed to make his whole body vibrate.  Making a grunt of his own, Perry pushed through the brush a little after now.  Some of the branches scraped at his arms and chest and face, but even that stopped pretty quickly.  He could still feel them pulling, but there was a cushion...  of hair!  This time he had to stop and stare a long time.  His chest was barreled out and arms hung low with huge, long-fingered hands.  His skin was invisible under a dark tangle of fur that already had leaves and twigs matted in it. And he was big!    It was hard to tell with only the trees to go by, but he was sure he was taller than even the biggest of the adults back at camp.  He giggled at the thought, but the sound came out as a guttural grunting.<br />
<br />
Feeling his throat, Perry found that the shaggy fur was already starting up his neck and even found a few strands on his cheeks.  And his hands were different, with only three fingers and a thumb on each and pads on the palms.  What was happening to him?  The confusion in his mind was making it hard to concentrate on anything but the dark shape ahead, and the sound and smell of it was becoming more important with each passing minute.  He started after it again, shifting and dropping a hand down to ease some strange feelings coming from his crotch.  That really didn&#39;t feel normal, and there was stuff there he hadn&#39;t had before. But it was nice, and the sensation tied in to what he already  feeling from the smells and sounds ahead of him.  <br />
<br />
Perry was hunched over some, party to keep rubbing himself, but also because his body was more comfortable that way.  He must be 7 or 8 feet tall now, maybe taller, and his footfalls were solid and heavy.  A dark mass pushed out under his eyes, and sounds and smells got even stronger.  The dark shape&#39;s odor seemed to flow down into his swelling penis, and he was dimly aware it was hard and sticking out in front of him.  It was so hard to think!  Perry was dimly aware that the trees around him were starting to glow softly with a blue-green light that are from nowhere and everywhere at the same time.  But his attention was focused on the scent - her scent.<br />
<br />
He broke through into a clearing suddenly, and saw the dark figure standing over near a pond.  There were insects floating in the air, all faint blue-green shimmers.  This wasn&#39;t the forest he had entered, but that was no longer important.  This was no longer the world he had been born in, but that was not important either.  All that mattered was the female.  She was a little smaller than him now, and when she turned, he saw that she was a monster.  Shaggy hair covered her from head to feet, and her face was more ape than human.  It was sorta like Chewbacca in Star Wars, but maybe a little caveman.  Her coat was matted with leaves and twigs, and her luminous round eyes were wide-set over a flat, wide nose.  <br />
<br />
Perry stopped dead, staring.  He was still rubbing himself, and felt a thick furred shah slide back.  Heavy weights swung under, swollen and pulsing with need.  She turned slowly, facing away for him, and knelt in the grass at the edge of the pool.  Why was she turning her back on him?  Bu then the source of her odor became visible, and emerging instincts told Perry what to do.  He shuffled towards the huge, hairy, beautiful female  and dropped behind her on his own knees.  Shifting forward, it took several tries to get his long, hard penis into the slick, black-lipped opening she was offering him.  As soon as he was inside he heaved himself over her back and started to thrust.  He saw her face in the still water of the pond, and memories of movies and TV shows finally provided an identification.  Sasquatch.  Or Yeti.  A beast-person.  Just like the blue-eyed monster above her.  He blinked, realizing that the larger monster was him, but he was locked in the mating cycle.  Thrusting hard, Perry watched as the bright blue eyes darkened, irises changing shape, becoming huge deep brown pools.  <br />
<br />
Pressure built, the heavy swollen weights under his rigid penis slapping against the female.  Perry grunted, feeling a sense of fulfillment, of purpose he had never experienced before in his young life.  At the same time, he could feel things slipping away.  The boy he had been, his family, friends, school, the ability to ride a bicycle, read a book, all fading from a mind that was more focused, more immediate.  The male shifted for a better position, knowing he would release soon.  He felt the female, his mate, clenching around him, and they grunted and then howled out in joint orgasm as their thoughts connected.  The new Sasquatch was touched by the minds of dozens of others, each offering some bit of knowledge. how to move how to hunt, how to stay hidden, how to shift from this world to the other.  And when he had jetted the last of his seed, the huge male lay there with his mate with only a vague memory of a tiny, pale, almost hairless creature to indicate Perry had ever existed at all, and the curious but very happy through that he was now big..</p>
