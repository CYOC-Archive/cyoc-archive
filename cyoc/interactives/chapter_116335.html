<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh, that’s easy! I wish I was, you know, more popular with the ladies!” And, remembering that he had a girlfriend already, “I mean, one in particular, you know?” grinning broadly and already hoping for some money, skills or a bigger cock.<br />
“Your wish is my command! It will be fulfilled within the next day. Then you may call me again for your next wish!” The genie nodded and dissolved into smoke again, vanishing into the lamp with a sucking noise.<br />
This was perfect! He had no idea what treasure he had found, thought Rick, as he took the lamp with him to his bedroom, quickly falling asleep.<br />
<br />
In the next morning, Rick got up excited. Part of him still couldn’t believe this all happened and thought he had dreamed. But the lamp was there alright.<br />
When he entered the kitchen though, his heart sank: Instead of his girlfriend, only a note was left on the kitchen table.<br />
“Hi Rick”, it said, “I’m so happy for you, and thank you for sharing it with me. It couldn’t have been easy for you. I guess you can understand that we can’t be together anymore, but I very much like to stay friends! Love, Lisa”.<br />
Confusion and anger mixed, as Rick read the lines. What was she talking about?! Stupid bitch, and that as he wanted to give her such a great gift! He crumbled the note and tossed it to the trash can. Well, there were plenty of other fish, as the saying went. He hasn’t been too sure of this relationship anyway. Angrily, he left the house for college.<br />
The day was weird for him. The day’s courses went no different from any other day, but he quickly found himself being easier around the ladies. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but he found that talking with them came more naturally and he could joke around with them like he could with guys. However, every now and then he got the feeling there was something strange going on. It felt like there was some sort of big secret everyone knew but him, yet nobody said anything. <br />
At one point, he even made a move on one busty cheerleader. He flirted a bit and after a particular flattering comment she said:<br />
“Oh come on Rick”, she laughed, “do you want to ask me out on a date now?” And laughed some more. For some reason the thought seemed to be really hilarious to her, which made Rick even more confused. He originally wanted to do exactly that, but the more he thought about it, the less he really wanted to. Sure, she was beautiful, but… somehow she wasn’t really his type – which stroke him as odd because he wanted to get in her panties for as long as he could remember. He mentally shrugged and laughed with her: “Yeaah…” and quickly escaped the conversation.<br />
In the afternoon, there was water polo practice. At first, everything felt normal, but once he was in the locker room with all the other guys changing, Rick felt very self-conscious all of a sudden. The other players around him were undressing like usually, but for some reason, the bodies of his teammates in various stages of undress made him feel confused. He never noticed – and probably never paid attention before – how well build they were. <br />
Rick was utterly confused. He never paid any attention to the male body before, but now it was like he was in the middle of the cheerleaders changing room. He was trying to look at everything and not to stare at the same time. To make matters worse, he could feel his dick raising to attention quickly and tried to hide it with his bag.<br />
“Hey, look who’s excited today!” The team’s captains, Joshs, voice snapped Rick out of his bubble. Completely taken by surprise, he didn’t even hold on to it as Josh snatched his bag from him, exposing his erection for everyone to see. <br />
Laughter followed, sure, but strangely enough it was the friendly kind of laughter, not the humiliating.<br />
In a slightly more serious voice, Josh added <br />
“Guys, I keep telling you: You can’t swim like that” and pointed right at Ricks throbbing erection. <br />
“So let your girls – or guys - take care of it before practice!” He nodded towards Rick as he said “guys”. “Especially”, he added, “if you’re easily excited by a perfect body like this.” Josh struck a pose and more laughter followed.<br />
Suddenly, it all made sense for Rick! Somehow, that genie made him gay! Of course –he almost slapped his forehead. Every woman wants a gay friend around them, so this made perfect sense, even though he wouldn’t have thought that way. He’d have to revert his wish right this evening! On the other hand, he always wondered a bit, how it would feel to be gay, not minding about women at all. And since everyone seemed to be super-accepting, he had until this evening to try it out.<br />
Again, Josh’s voice interrupted Rick’s thoughts:<br />
“Okay, to handle this situation… I’d say the rest of the team already gets to the water except Rick and Marven, who stay behind in the locker room for a minute or two. Perhaps you two can work something out.” <br />
More laughter followed, as most of the team left the locker room. Marven was the only, no, Rick corrected himself, the only other gay member of the water polo team. He was younger than Rick and only rather recently came out of the proverbial closet.<br />
Soon, only Rick and Marven remained, nothing between them but silence – and a throbbing erection.<br />
“Uhm…” said Marven, “D-do you want me, to… you know… suck you off perhaps?” It was kind of cute to watch him struggle. Clearly he hadn’t done this sort of thing very often. And boy was he good-locking. Marven was athletic as well, but being a few years younger gave him a cute charm Rick just never noticed before. Well, it was only for today, so why not test drive those gay instincts.<br />
He nodded. “Good idea, if you don’t mind. Get to work!” <br />
Marven didn’t need to be told twice as he dropped to the ground in front of Ricks ample cock and began to work it with his mouth and hands. Instantly, Rick began to moan. That guy surely knew what he was doing down there, despite his clumsy conversation. Lisa had given him blowjobs before, but nothing nearly as good as this. It was strange, but oh so arousing to see Marven get hard in his speedo as well, clearly enjoying what he was doing.<br />
It didn’t take him long at all until Rick shoot his load right into Marven’s throat, panting from exhaustion. However, as Marven got up, Rick didn’t waste any time to get on his knees himself and return the favor.<br />
He didn’t give a blowjob before, but he found it easy, if he just remembered what he liked most. Marven didn’t seem to mind as well, as he was moaning loudly and, after a couple of minutes, ejaculated into Rick’s mouth.<br />
Having another men’s semen inside his mouth seemed weird at first – it had a slimy texture, but it didn’t taste all that bad.  Deciding to be a man about it, he swallowed it down and smiled.<br />
“Thanks buddy!” he said. Marven nodded “Uhm, no problem – and thanks to you, too. Perhaps”, he added, “we could do that again sometimes.” <br />
Rick surely didn’t mind. At least blowjobs were so very much better with another man, he almost couldn’t believe what he had been missing out on.<br />
After the training ended in the evening, Rick went straight home. He had been thinking. Should he really try to reverse the wish? After all, he had unlimited wishes and didn’t need to hurry. Surely one or two more days being gay wouldn’t be so bad.<br />
As he arrived in his bedroom (he only just now noticed the posters on the walls showing men in various stages of undress), he quickly picked up the lamp and rubbed it.<br />
As it was on the night before, the genie quickly appeared out of midnight blue smoke, his voice  booming: “Ahh, mortal! How did you enjoy your first wish? Are you ready to make another one?”<br />
Having decided what to do, Rick nodded. “Sure! Genie, I wish…”</p>
