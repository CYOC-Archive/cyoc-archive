<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen is taking a walk in the park after school. The park still didn&#39;t have many people. After all, it was a weekday. Jen took a deep breath and let the fresh air fill her lungs. She felt so free, so independent. Maybe she would just take some time off from school and study for a change. She looked up at the clouds as they moved across the sky and wished that she could be up there among them.<br />
<br />
She looked around and saw that she was alone. She was able to relax a little before she realized that she had been staring at the sky for a while. However, she does not notice the appearance of a small creature inside her clothes. A flea.<br />
<br />
Jen looked down at her own white, short skirt, which left very little to the imagination. She had just changed her clothes when she got home from school and it was much more comfortable. Then she noticed that the flea was biting her right on her pussy.<br />
<br />
She gasped in horror and quickly grabbed her crotch. She was so surprised by the sudden bite that it took a second for her to react. But before she could scratch, the itch had already begun. She began to feel it, that itch. It was just a little bit of discomfort at first.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;This can&#39;t be right.&quot; But it was! No matter how much she wished it wasn&#39;t, she knew that it was the truth.<br />
<br />
Then she felt the familiar sting of a bite. She looked down in horror as the flea ran away, leaving her pussy covered in a nasty bite mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh... What the hell is happening?&quot; Jen whispered to herself as she looked around nervously, making sure there were no witnesses. Still, she began to worry that someone might see her scratching herself like a whore and not care who looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an animal,&quot; she thought. &quot;Its just a bug, and I can take care of it myself.&quot; She began to panic as she tried to scratch herself through her clothes, but the itch just kept getting worse. It was like a fire in her body and she couldn&#39;t put it out.<br />
<br />
She tried to run to the restroom, but it was too far away. She would have to take her clothes off and do something more drastic. But by now she was starting to feel embarrassed, even in a deserted park. She couldn&#39;t be seen like this! The thought of taking her clothes off right here, right now made her feel shame, but what other option did she have?<br />
<br />
With trembling hands, she tried to undo the buttons of her shirt, but her hands were shaking too much to do it right. Jen looked around and said:<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no one around here anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
She undid the button to her shirt and pulled it off, exposing her bra. Jen looked at them with a mixture of fear and shame. She began to look for the flea on her shirt, after searching each area of &#8203;&#8203;her shirt thoroughly, she said:<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not on the shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen took off her shoes and socks, leaving her barefoot. Then pulled the zipper on her skirt and slid it down her legs, leaving her in just her underwear and bra, both pink. She picked up the skirt from the floor began to look for the flea on her skirt. After searching each area of &#8203;&#8203;her skirt thoroughly, she said:<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not on the skirt either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen put her hands behind her back and unhooked her bra. She pulled her bra off and looked for the flea on her bra. After searching each area of &#8203;&#8203;the bra thoroughly, she said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even in my bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer stood there half naked, feeling more and more exposed. In her own mind she was screaming: &quot;This is so humiliating!&quot; But the words never escaped her lips. It wasn&#39;t just a flea. It was a curse! And it was forcing her to do things she didn&#39;t want to do.<br />
<br />
She looked at the sky and screamed: &quot;I don&#39;t have to be ashamed.&quot; But the words never left her lips, and she was too embarrassed to say anything else, even though she knew that no one would hear.<br />
<br />
She grabbed the bottoms of her underwear and pulled them off with a quick motion. She glanced at her wet pussy and said, &quot;At least the itch is gone.&quot; She then looked all over her underwear and said: &quot;Much less is it in my panties.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was naked. Completely naked. She was ashamed. Completely ashamed. But it didn&#39;t matter anymore because she had taken care of the flea that caused all this. She sighed with relief and looked at the sky, &quot;Thank God it&#39;s over.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that he heard a noise, someone was approaching. She didn&#39;t have time to think about it. She had to run and hide before someone saw her in her humiliating situation.<br />
<br />
She searched for a place to hide. After a few moments, she found the perfect place. There was a tree near her. It was large enough to hide behind.<br />
<br />
She ran quickly toward it. She moved her head side to side as she ran, trying to find the best hiding spot. Jennifer ducked into a thick patch of bushes and fell into the ground, lying flat on her stomach. She didn&#39;t dare move after taking that risk.  But she forgot something important, she forgot to grab her clothes before hiding.<br />
<br />
By now she was more embarrassed than ever. The whole world could see her like this! She was completely naked, and she couldn&#39;t do anything to cover herself!<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the worst day of my life!&quot; She said between her teeth.<br />
<br />
She heard the footsteps approaching, feeling that she was being exposed to some kind of danger. She began to listen to her heart beating faster and faster. &quot;It&#39;s not a danger, it&#39;s not a danger, it&#39;s not a danger,&quot; she thought to herself. But her heart wouldn&#39;t stop beating fast, and she felt scared.</p>
