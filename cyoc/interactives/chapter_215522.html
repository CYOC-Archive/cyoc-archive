<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>DnD adventure is still being edited by Krentol. Here&#39;s a chapter for the delay :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff reached over to the rack of animal caps and grabbed a tawny-colored knit-wool beanie with two round plush ears. It looked cute, but then again, they all looked cute and any of them would have worked for what he had in mind for Ryan. What really drew Jeff’s attention to this cap in particular was a thin cloth wrap, covered in golden brown yard, that was designed to cover the sides of its wearer’s neck – making them look like they had a lion’s mane.<br />
<br />
He pulled the cap down over Ryan’s head until it was snug, adjusting it to fit properly, covering Ryan’s ears. Ryan raised a brow and turned to look at himself in the little mirrors on the turnstile. It looked cute on him, in all honesty, the cap framed his face and made his blue eyes shine.<br />
<br />
“Look at you!” Jeff said in a sing-song voice. “So cute!”<br />
<br />
Ryan grimaced.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Jeff said in a pouty voice as he reached out and playfully pinched Ryan’s cheek, “such an angry lion! A big jock cat like me!” <br />
<br />
“Knock it off!” Ryan snarled, batting away Jeff’s paw.<br />
<br />
“Aw, what’s the matter mister cat?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a cat, I’m just a human!” Ryan yanked the cap off and tossed it at Jeff’s chest.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, whoa whoa pal!” Jeff grinned, tugging the beanie back on Ryan’s head, ignoring his hands as he tried slapping him away. “Just hold still so I can take a picture.”<br />
<br />
“Wearing a hat doesn’t make me a cat,” Ryan blushed fiercely but stood still while Jeff pulled out his phone.<br />
<br />
“Oh, and what if it did?” Jeff glanced up from his phone, “What animal would you be?”<br />
<br />
“Uh...” Ryan said as he looked at the cap, “a lion?”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Jeff grinned and looked back at his phone.<br />
<br />
“Come on Jeff,” Ryan said, turning to the massive tiger man. Jeff was fiddling with his phone. “This thing looks so stupid on me! Just take the picture already.”<br />
<br />
“Hold on,” Jeff spoke offhandedly, “I just got a text.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know how a hat will help me understand you more.”<br />
<br />
“I think you will in a moment,” Jeff looked up, giving Ryan a brilliant smile, showing off his pearly white fangs and hitting a button on his phone with an air of finality.<br />
<br />
“What-” A shiver passed through Ryan’s form.<br />
<br />
Ryan ground his teeth under Jeff’s gaze, his body feeling suddenly electric and riled up. He wanted to fight something.  Then, no – not fight, he wanted to fuck. No, that wasn’t right either, though his cock had gone rigid in his pants. <br />
<br />
“Man, I feel like,” Ryan flexed his hands and panted. “Like I want to do something. Right now.”<br />
<br />
“Something like…?” Jeff grinned, eyeing the clearly agitated young man.<br />
<br />
“Just-” Ryan snarled in frustration, “I don’t know! Anything!”<br />
<br />
“Let’s hit the gym, bud!” Jeff said, slapping Ryan across the back, “Let’s burn off that extra energy! Must be all that testosterone pulsing through your system. Don’t worry, it’s what I do.”<br />
<br />
Ryan wanted to protest. He wasn’t some jock like Jeff. But his body burned and his balls pulsed oddly in his too-tight pants. The young man needed to move, to lift something. <br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, let’s go.”<br />
<br />
“Great!” Jeff slapped Ryan’s back, nearly knocking the human over. “I told you we have lots in common! There’s a Muscle Beach just two stores down, let’s pump some iron!”<br />
<br />
Ryan followed the massive tiger, adjusting himself so his rock-hard cock was pinned by the waistband of his jeans. It wasn’t a long walk, but all Ryan spent the entire time feeling like his calf muscles were about to spring out of his legs. His heart raced and sweat beaded down his forehead as energy surged through his body. It was all he could do not to take off running. <br />
<br />
They reached the gym. It was small but had enough free benches that they could workout without any problems. The tiger talked to a handsome young man at the counter, negotiating for membership, while Ryan fidgeted uncomfortably in the lobby.  As he looked around, he spotted a dumbbell lift and he felt himself drifting away in his own mind, imagining a buff anthropomorphic feline, bare-chested, doing sets of curls.<br />
<br />
Already semi-erect, he felt himself getting even harder. Was he really getting aroused at the thought of Jeff lifting weights?<br />
<br />
No, he quickly realized, the coloration on the fur was all wrong, and this feline had a thick mane of hair growing around his neck. It wasn’t a tiger he was picturing; it was a lion. Did Ryan know any lions?  He didn’t think so.<br />
<br />
His eye caught a nearby wall-to-wall mirror, and the sight of something moving in the reflection briefly distracted him from the lion that was otherwise filling his thoughts – he could have sworn that he’d seen one of the lion hat’s ears twitch. Then, as he looked into the mirror, he got the vague sense that something was off about himself – other than the stupid lion hat he was wearing, of course.<br />
<br />
Unable to shake that feeling, he approached the mirror and stared at himself, trying to figure out what was wrong with him.  His skin was flushed and he was a little sweaty, but nothing was out of place. Still the same soft features and chubby face to match the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
He scratched his chest, not noticing hairs curling under his shirt. His balls pulsed, making Ryan gasp, and more warmth surged through his body. When he looked back up at his reflection, he realized something had changed.<br />
<br />
His face was less rounded and feminine. <br />
<br />
Ryan’s eyes seemed duller and his wide-eyed look had turned into a subtle squint, giving him a tougher edge, the sky blue of now more of a navy color, deeper and darker. Plump lips thinned, pulling back into a sneer.  <br />
<br />
There was another pulse from his balls and Ryan had to steady himself on the mirror as his round face started to square and more pronounced, his narrow face widening. The fat that had softened his features faded away, leaving him with high cheekbones and hard angles. His forehead lowered, pulling the beanie even lower, while his brow grew more pronounced, his eyes sinking into their sockets. Even his nose wasn’t spared, his cute button growing more roman.  <br />
<br />
With every pleasurably aching pulse of his balls, Ryan looked less like a nerd and more and more like a thug with a tough, confident demeanor. <br />
<br />
“Like what you see?” Jeff purred from behind him.<br />
<br />
Ryan blinked, seeing the jock tiger behind him. Jeff must have been standing there for a while, but Ryan had been so occupied with his face, he hadn’t noticed. The young man scratched his cheek and dense beard hair bristled underneath his fingers.<br />
<br />
He turned back to the mirror and saw his face. Ryan was sure there was something off about it, but the scowling, brutish face looking back at him was the same as always. He grunted as his balls sent another warm wave of tingles throughout his body.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s paw encircled Ryan, drawing him close. <br />
<br />
“Jeff!” Ryan blushed.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, no one cares,” Jeff grinned.<br />
<br />
Jeff ran his paw over Ryan’s body, calling attention to other changes that had occurred while Ryan had been preoccupied with his face.<br />
<br />
His wide hips and little gut were gone. In fact, as the paw slid over him, all the fat on his body had vanished. Ryan’s balls pulsed and his shoulder’s cracked as they expanded further from each other, broadening his torso and shifting his body into a more dominant stance. His frame steadily thickened as his bone structure grew heaver.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s paw lifted up Ryan’s shirt, revealing his chest and belly. Ryan blushed and realized the massive tiger had positioned himself to block the view of any onlookers. When he looked back, he stared at himself in confusion. <br />
<br />
Did he usually have a short beard on his face? He blinked, and it trimmed itself into a chinstrap style that, along with the beanie, made his thuggish face… handsome, in a blunt way. And was he always this stocky? <br />
<br />
The tiger’s paw slid up his chest, bringing Ryan’s attention to the thick line of hair that ran from his groin to the shag carpet covering his hardening pecs. His pec chubbed as they swelled thick with muscle, and he swore he saw his flat stomach puff with abs, their definition becoming clearer with every-he grunted-pulse of his balls. He looked completely different from how he looked before… but before what? The memories of being a short, chubby nerd faded with his feminine features and bodyfat.<br />
<br />
Ryan grunted again, the pulses coming faster and faster. <br />
<br />
He admired himself in the mirror, watching as the little lump his cock made in his jeans swelled generously. His formerly flat ass plumped and rounded into a perky bubblebutt. Jeff’s paw reached his crotch and massaged it through the denim. Ryan groaned as the tiger unzipped the fly and his jockstrap fell out, straining near to bursting as it struggled to contain his fat cock.<br />
<br />
“Looking hot, bud. Looks like all the time we spent at this gym has done you good.” Jeff purred.<br />
<br />
The gym? But he’d never- Jeff tweaked his nipple playfully, making Ryan moan.<br />
<br />
What was he thinking about again? Ryan flexed an arm, admiring the bulge of muscle from long hours at the gym with his best friend, Jeff. Damn, he looked so sexy, especially with that chinstrap beard that was changing color as he watched, shifting from black to the same golden brown as the mane on his beanie.<br />
<br />
 Jeff sure knew how to accessorize!<br />
<br />
He pulled out his phone and palmed his bulge with a hairy arm, the muscles flexing. Jeff smiled down at Ryan as he snapped a few sexy pics of himself in lewd poses and uploaded them to his social media. Ryan noticed the tiger watching him in the mirror and smiled back.<br />
<br />
“Ready to do some free-weights?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“Why, I thought you’d never ask,” Jeff&#39;s smile widened into a predatory grin. <br />
<br />
The massive tiger and muscled human walked over to a private corner and started their workout routine.</p>
