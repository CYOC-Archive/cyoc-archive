<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren himself is affected by the change Ken had done, he already has forgotten that Jeff is walking beside him, instead he thinks that he just returned from the market where he had bought the young Mare for his dad. His dad told him to buy a 5 year-old Mare, because that is the best age to breed a mare, Darren was only able to find this weird looking Mare, he assumes that it is some kind of miscarriage, and hopes his dad won’t mind. Jeff himself is unaware of this as he continues to follow his best friend.<br />
<br />
“Darren,” both teens look up when they hear Darren’s dad, Tom, call, “I need to examine the Mare, so, could you please inject her with knock-out serum? You’ll find a full syringe in the cupboard by the free back stall I prepared for her.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, dad,” Darren replies, he then heads towards the stables, Jeff follows behind.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t tell me you got a new Mare,” he says, “will she be for breeding or for racing?”<br />
<br />
Darren ignores Jeff, ‘this Mare sure is acting weird,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
When they enter the stables, Jeff follows Darren to the back, “hey, Darren,” he says, “why are you suddenly ignoring me?”<br />
<br />
Darren does not say a word, he just opens up a cupboard and grabs something, which Jeff can’t see, he then walks towards the empty stall and opens the gate, entering the stall.<br />
<br />
Jeff follows Darren into the stall, the teen looks around in confusion, “uh? I don’t see any Mare he… OUCH,” he suddenly yells when he feels a sharp pain in his right shoulder, but before he is able to check what it was that stung him, he suddenly feels woozy and dizzy. The teen stumbles, “wh-what… is… ha-happening,” he asks before falling over onto the straw covered floor of the stall and passing out.<br />
<br />
After Jeff has passed out, Darren simply and without a word exits the stall and closes the gate, then simply walks away.<br />
<br />
Darren enters the main house, “dad, the Mare is ready for examination,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Darren,” his father says, “you got a weird looking Mare,” he says as he meets his son in the hallway.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Darren says, “but she was the only horse that fits what you asked for. The other farmers all said that they only have males this year. But there was this one farmer who had this weird looking 5 year-old Mare, and since you said you needed a Mare “right now” I figured to simply buy her. Hope you are not to mad?”<br />
<br />
Tom shakes his head, “I am not mad,” he says, “I’ll make it work. Let me examine her first, if there are any issues, I have a way to fix her and make her right, but I won’t know for sure until I examine her.”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “let me know if you need any help,” he says, starting to head up to his room.<br />
<br />
“Will do,” Tom says, “have you given her the “weak” or “strong” stuff?”<br />
<br />
“I gave her the strong stuff,” Darren calls from upstairs, “that’ll keep her asleep for a few hours, enough time for you to do your thing.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Darren,” Tom says, and with that he leaves the house and heads to the stables.<br />
<br />
When Tom enters the stables he heads straight for the back stall, smiling wide when he sees the “Mare” passed out on the floor, “time to get started,” the man says to himself, “first, let’s get her out of those clothes. I wonder why the breeder dressed her up in human clothes.”<br />
<br />
Tom leans down and starts to strip the “Horse” out of the clothing, he then throughs the clothes into a big rubbish bag and takes it to the trash. After returning to the “Mare”, Tom looks down at “her”, scratching his chin, “her whole body looks… weird,” he mumbles, “no tail, the wrong genitals, her legs look also wrong, no wonder she was walking upright like a human, and the wrong size of a 5 year-old Mare. But I have something here that’ll fix her.”<br />
<br />
The man takes out his phone and opens the Chronivac-App, he then scans the “Horse” and opens “her” file.<br />
<br />
Tom shakes his head when he reads through the “Mare’s” stats, “time to correct it,” with that he starts to edit the file: he changes Jeff’s name to “Star”, age from 16 to 5, gender from male to female, he then opens the “Horse Transformation” tab and selects American Quarter Horse. Tom then selects the size of the “Horse’s” to be 64 inches and weigh 1.200 pounds. Tom then changes the stance from “two legged” to “four legged”, and adds a black tail, then he transfers the selection to “Star’s” file. The man looks over the changes and nods, a happy smile on his face, “looks right to me,” he says. Tom is about to confirm the change, when he remembers that the &quot;Horse&quot; has no Horseshoes to protect the animal&#39;s &quot;hooves&quot;. The man facepalms himself, &quot;almost forget the most important thing, I don&#39;t want her to ruin her pefect hooves,&quot; he says, after adding that change, he finally confirms the change.<br />
<br />
Tom exits the stall and closes the door, he then leans against the door to watch the “Mare” return to “her” natural appearance. Since Tom and everyone, except Jeff and Ken, are affected by Ken’s manipulation of the reality, everyone sees Jeff as a anthropomorphic Horse, so in their vision, Jeff has the head and neck of a horse and black shiny fur covering his body, that is the reason why Tom only did the changes he did, in reality however, Jeff is still human. Thanks to Toms changes, Jeff will be a human in the size of a female American Quarter Horse, with a long black Horse’s tail, the wrong genitals and doomed to walk on all fours, and able to become pregnant by a Stallion. When the horseshoes appear, they are not shaped as normal horseshoes, they adjust to Jeff&#39;s human hands and toes, since Jeff will be forced to stand and walk on his toes once he is locked in the feral stance. The knockout injection is so strong that Jeff does not awaken as the horseshoes get nailed into his flesh, but strangely, no blood is to be seen, just as if nailing horseshoes into normal hooves. Jeff&#39;s chest puffs out, forming small breasts, which travel down the changing boy&#39;s body to his... her crotch, becoming the teats of a female Horse, ready to be filled with milk to nurse foals.<br />
<br />
Darren’s dad, who thinks he has done the “poor animal” a favour, smiles as he watches the “Mare” return to her “original” appearance. What Tom also did was to add the mind of a Horse to Jeff’s human mind, causing two minds to live in one body, the Horse-part of the mind being the dominant one.<br />
<br />
After the transformation is over, Tom exits the stables and heads towards the main house, letting the “Mare” to wake up, ‘I’ll check on her in the morning and introduce her to the rest of the herd,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I think “Lightning” or “Shadow” will find her… interesting. I wonder who of the two studs will end up getting her!’</p>
