<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sara had chosen to join the thieves school, reasoning that if she was indeed a succubus, they could teach her ways to remain hidden. Not seeing The thieves school as a path of a hero, Stan decided to join the church as a paladin. The first days of training was about learning the Thief&#39;s Code. Sara found the idea of honor among thieves laughable until her mentors explained how it was meant to prevent chaos and separate them from the common thugs and bandits. <br />
                    The Code<br />
1. Do not steal from a fellow thief<br />
2. Do not interfere with another&#39;s mark<br />
3. Self defense is necessary at times, but outright murder is never an option we are not assassins<br />
4. Do not rat on your fellow thieves<br />
5. Do not kidnap, or trade in living things, no matter the coin or jewel.<br />
6. Do not steal from those less fortunate, a single copper is worth more to a beggar than 100 gold will ever be to an emperor<br />
<br />
Sara, after a while, began to see the importance of The Code, but as her mentors whispered, rules can be broken if one has no honor. And someone with no honor is not worth hiring.<br />
<br />
Of course the school knew about Sara being a succubus, but no one cared about it. They only saw a new student wanting to learn and Sara was happy to be open about herself.  While at this age, Sara did not desire sex, in fact the idea repulsed her, her own body began to change on her 13th birthday. Sara woke up on the night of her birthday sweating profusely in her bed. Quietly getting up and exiting the bunk room to the restroom as quickly and as quietly as possible. Gazing into the mirror, Sara saw a pair of small bumps begin to grow from her forehead, causing a massive headache in the process. Sara was fairly sure she was going to be suck as her stomach did somersaults.  Turning to the toilets, Sara rushed over just in time as she emptied her dinner into the toilet. Panting heavily, Sara used some toilet paper to wipe away any on left on her mouth. As she was bent over,  sara felt something pushing painfully from her rear followed bya tearing sound as something tore free from her breeches. Glancing over her shoulder,  Sara saw a short hairless tail about 1 foot long swinging from her backside. Standing up slowly, Sara walked back towards the mirror, her somewhat pale skin from working in the shadows for so long looked flushed. Leaning in for a closer look, Sara saw that the bumps had gotten bigger, with a small black nub breaking through the skin. It almost looked like a....&quot;horns, I have horns,&quot; Sara whispered timidly to herself. As she examined her horns and her new tail, Sara felt like a horse had kicked her in the gut and nearly fell to her knees clutching her stomach. Using one hand to steady herself on the sink, Sara straightened up and felt a similar pain hit her crotch. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me,&quot; Mary whispered, tears falling down her cheeks. Moving her free hand downward, Sara found a bulge pushing out just above where her privates were. Sara pulled her waistband away from her to see what was happening as a twisting, stretching pain emanated from the growth. Slowly and painfully, the growth pushed outward until it began to take on a new shape.  Sara watched as a penis formed on the top of the growth and a sack with two balls formed from the bottom.  In shock Sara inhaled preparing to let out a terrified scream when a hand move quickly from behind and covered her mouth. &quot;Sara, don&#39;t, you&#39;ll wake the entire school,&quot; whispered Vect in Sara&#39;s ear, &quot;I&#39;m going to move my hand, don&#39;t scream please.&quot;<br />
Slowly the hand moved away from her mouth and Sara turned sharply toward her best friend, the High Elf Vect, and embraced him, tears streaming down her face as she cried. Vect was the same age as Sara and was typical of high elves: long blond hair, angular features, and green eyes. Vect, not sure what to do, only stood there and hugged her, letting Sara calm down as the two Sat on the floor. After half a hour of sobbing, Sara finally spoke, &quot;thank you,&quot; sniff, &quot;but what are you doing up?&quot; &quot;You may be good at sneaking, but I&#39;ve still got amazing hearing,&quot; Vect smiled, &quot;that and I wanted to give you something for your birthday,&quot; Vect held out a wrapped item. Unwrapping it slowly, Sara saw a beautiful dagger, the hilt was black with gold treads wrapping around the handle. A small ruby was set into the bottom of the handle, and the sheath had a stylized leaf and branches design. Sara absolutely loved it and for a moment forgot about what had just happened until her tail began to tap the floor and began to feel somber again. &quot;What am I going to do? I&#39;m a monster.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re not a monster, you are Sara, my best friend and possibly the second best thief ever to come from this school. No physical change will ever change that,&quot; Vect brought her in another hug. &quot;Thank you, but what about the other students?&quot; &quot;They already know about you being a succubus,  a little physical changes won&#39;t mean much.&quot;<br />
&quot;This is a little change?,&quot; Sara stood up and dropped her pants to show the 3&quot; organ hanging from her. &quot;Vect, I have a dick now. Am I still a girl? How do I even use the bath room?&quot; <br />
Raising an eyebrow, &quot;in case you didn&#39;t notice, half the people here have dicks, including me. Second, I&#39;ve heard of weirder things coming from the mages school. Third, I&#39;ll leave the gender thing to you to figure out. And fourth, I don&#39;t know. And fifth, please pull up your pants.&quot; <br />
&quot;How are you so calm about this?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m an elf, we are supposed to act calm and all knowing, it&#39;s expected of us,&quot; replied Vect with a hint of sarcasm.<br />
&quot;Come on Sara, we&#39;ll make it through this together, what are friends for?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, but can we at least stay in here and talk a little longer?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
&quot;By the way, what do you mean second best,&quot; asked Mary punching Vect in the arm playfully. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sara took to wearing a hood and tucking her tail into her pants whenever she went out in public, but at school she was not afraid to show the students her horns of tail,  however her new organ she chose to keep a secret for only Vect and herself. The students really didn&#39;t care about her features, and even joked with her. One time they even magically bonded a bell to the end for a day to make her tasks harder.  Sara still got top scores despite the handicap.<br />
Over time Sara became very adept at hiding, picking locks, and especially at planning heists. Near the end of her 3rd year, Sara, Vect and 2 of her other friends, Mai the pixie, and Jack the human, had successfully pulled off a job on a visiting merchant lord and mare off with 8,000 gold without getting caught, earning them the respect of all their fellow students and teachers. They even were allowed to keep most of it. 1600 gold was an astonishing amount for them to have at such a young age. The group went out to celebrate at a tavern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s to us, the greatest thieves to ever graduate,&quot; shouted Jack as he downed his drink. The boy was the largest of the group at 4&#39; 7&quot; with very early signs of puberty.<br />
&quot;Could you keep it down a bit, I can almost feel my ears bleeding,&quot; whined Mai. The pixie was their best scout and at 6&quot; you had to be careful around her or else you might cause her harm. <br />
&quot;Sorry Mai, but I&#39;m just so happy we pulled it off.<br />
&quot;A toast to our success in all we do,&quot; Vect chimed in.<br />
&quot;And to the amazing person who planned it all out,&quot; Sara said with a grin.<br />
&quot;No need to toot your own horn Sara,&quot; said Jack, &quot;you have us for that.&quot;<br />
&quot;We have had an amazing year,&quot; Mai spoke up in her squeaky voice. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we graduate a whole 2 years ahead of everyone else.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the perk of being so good, it opens new opportunities. What are you thinking of doing jack?&quot; Asked Vect. <br />
&quot;Gonna try the fighters guild.&quot;<br />
&quot;You too? Me and Vect were looking at doing that too,&quot; Sara said excitedly. &quot;What about you Mai?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the mages path for me. Sorry, but it looks like I&#39;ll be leaving you guys,&quot; said Mai ssadly.<br />
&quot;Well if we may have to go our separate ways, why don&#39;t we become blood bonded,&quot; suggested Jack.<br />
&quot;What? What&#39;s that,&quot; asked Sara.<br />
&quot;Its a custom in my village, when friends become close enough, we each cut our hands and drop the blood into a goblet and mix it. Then we each drink a little of it and we are bonded by the blood we have consumed.&quot; Jack explained, oblivious to their mixed expressions. <br />
&quot;That sounds unsanitary, &quot; Vect stated.<br />
&quot;Its a tradition in my village,  no one&#39;s ever gotten sick, and some say they feel stronger, but that might be just false feelings. It would mean alot to me though,&quot; Jack said. <br />
After a bit of discussion,  the friends agreed and Jack pulled out a common woodeb goblet he kept with him to remind him of home. Sara pulled out the dagger Vect had given her and they all gave some blood to the goblet, with Mai picking her hand on the blade point and stirred it for them. Dividing the crimson concoction into portions they all drank at once. <br />
As they swallowed, each felt a small shimmer of warmth in them, but paid no mind to it as they thought it was just the temp of the blood as it went down their throats. <br />
<br />
Graduation came and went with a small ceremony for the new thieves and soon enough they had all set out for their new learning experience.<br />
