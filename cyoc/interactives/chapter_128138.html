<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Much to Mika&#39;s chagrin, Jennifer and Shiro were probably the most adorable couple at school. Throughout the remainder of the week Mika rolled her eyes as she noticed the two were inseperable. What was worse was the over the top cute things they did such as sharing lunches, walking eachother to class or constantly holding hands in the hallway. Mika rolling her eyes and groaning were now a common occurrence whenever she saw her now twin brother.<br />
<br />
The only thing the girls had to look forward to now was the Harris&#39;s annual Memorial Day picnic. Claudia and her family held it every year amd it would be the first time Katie and Kellie would attend.  Both girls had received an invite and would have their families in tow. As an added bonus Tom and Marjorie told Lisa she could bring Jason and Gloroa as well, which the two happily agreed to.<br />
<br />
As Katie sat in the car with Lisa, Jason and Gloria she wondered what to expect. Claudia said that her sister Julia and brother Derrick were coming from D.C. for the event. She had yet to meet either but had heard stories. Derrick seemed okay but by the way Claudia talked about Julia she wondered if she would need to break up a fist fight. As the car pulled into the driveway Katie could already see that all the guests had arrived. Marjorie Harris smiled and waved as Katie and her family now approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so happy you could make it,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;Come in, come in. Tom is out back messing around with his grill but the food should be ready soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa thanked Marjorie as they all entered thw Harris home. Once in back Katie noticed Tom Harris, Ian McKinnon and Samanthas father all gathered around the grill, trying to give advise on how to pre heat it. &quot;Hey Katie,&quot; Lisa called. &quot;Can I talk to you in private?&quot; Nodding Katie followed her mom out of earshot from everyone else. Lisa carefully looked around before whispering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen can you do me a favor. Can you and your friends NOT screw around with the ring today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katir grinned. &quot;I promise mom no ring.&quot; Satisfied Lisa sighed in relief. &quot;Thanks kid,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#39;m kinda hoping to just jave fun and relax. The last thing I want to do is try to explain all of that to Jason when were trying to build our relarionship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understamd mom so dont worry I&#39;ll make sure nothing crazy happens.&quot; Satisfied Lisa smiled as she went to join Kumiko, who was sitting with Shiro. Katie now looked aroumd the yard, noticing her friends sitting towards the back. As she approached she could see both Mika and Claudia sporting glum expressions. &quot;Hey guys hows everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
The others smiled and waved while Mika and Claudia just shrugged gloomily. &quot;Everything okay?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh its my freaking brother,&quot; Mika groaned. &quot;Not only are we twims but hes still older by four minutes. Plus hes acting like hes some damn trailblazer by dating a white girl. He wont shut up about Jen....its freaking annoying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie suppressed a giggle before turning to Claudia. &quot;So what&#39;s up with you Claud?&quot; Claudia responded by pointing. Turning Katie saw a gorgeous woman with long blond hair. The woman was Claudia&#39;s older sister Julia, standing 5&#39;11&quot; with long firm legs, perky d cup breasts, a trim buld and a models face. Katie was in awe at her beauty, something Claudia saw and was immediately annoyed with. &quot;Take a picture it will last longer,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Katie blushed before apologizing. &quot;Sorry it&#39;s just I never saw her before shes very pretty.&quot;Claudia frowned even more. &quot;Yeah I know,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Stupid perfect Julia. &quot;<br />
<br />
Before Katie could say anything, Julia approached smiling widely. &quot;Oh hello,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;You must be Claudia&#39;s new friends. Im her sister Julia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they figured that out Jules,&quot; Claudia groaned.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and waved meekly as the model now surveyed her sisters friends. &quot;Oh stop being such a downer Claud,&quot; she grinned. &quot;You&#39;ll have to excuse her she always gets embarassed whenever I talk with her friends.  She thinks I talk down to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia clenched her jaw as Julia continued. &quot;You know you haven&#39;t even introduced me to your new friends or your little girlfriend sis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie, Kellie thats Julia,&quot; Claudia grunted. &quot;And you already know Mika so whats the point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia shook her head in an almost motherly fashion of disapproval as she looked fown at her kid sister. &quot;I&#39;m just trying to be polite,&quot; she said. &quot;Its not like I get to see your friends that often working in D.C.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Claudia could respond a large hand thundered down on her shoulder. &quot;What&#39;s up chipmunk,&quot; a voice boomed. Turning around Claudia burst into tears. &quot;COLE,&quot; she screamed loudly as she lept into her older brothers arms.<br />
<br />
Katie gaped at Cole Harris, who was able to carry Claudia with one arm. She had been told he was big but nothing could prepare her for what she saw. Dressed in military fatigues the man was slightly taller than Claudia&#39;s dad and carried at least 50 lbs more muscle on his frame. Cole, unlike his dad, had decided to shave his head which only seemed to make him more intimidating. Smiling he patted his little sisters back. &quot;Guess you missed me huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia didn&#39;t answer but continued to cry. Julia smiled as she looked at her brother. &quot;Its been too long little bro,&quot; she said warmly giving him a hug. &quot;Well it&#39;s been three years,&quot; he said sheepishly. &quot;Finally got lucky enough to get some much needed down time. Sorry didnt say anything but kinda wanted to surprise you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia smiled as she looked her brother over. &quot;Well I&#39;m just glad your in one piece now if you could just put your chipmunk down for a sec I need to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole nodded as he slowly lowered Claudia to the ground.  Claudia now wiped her eyes as she stared at her older siblings. &quot;But...but...I haven&#39;t even introduced him to Mika,&quot; she stammered, tears still staining her cheeks. Julia turned to face her sister, the look of motherly warmth still pressed on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia it will only take a sec,&quot; she soothed. &quot;I just really need to talk with him, then you can introduce him to your little girlfriend and the rest of your pals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia&#39;s eyes now filled with rage as she looked at Julia. She was tired of her sister being so condescending to her. Now she was even monopolizing her brother, even though she hadnt seen him since she was 13. As her face now flushed violently Claudia looked at Katie.<br />
<br />
Katie had no time to react as Claudia pounce on her. Shocked she watched as Claudia wrestled the ring of age off her finger, placing it on her own. &quot;Claudia NO!!&quot; she screamed.<br />
<br />
Claudia, filled with fury, refused to listen as she stared daggers at her sisters back. &quot;I wish....&quot; she screamed as the ring began to glow.</p>
