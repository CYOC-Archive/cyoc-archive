<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting in her room, Abby hummed to herself. At the age of eight, she couldn't read so well, so most of the words on the piece of paper didn't make much sense...but she did get the gist of what was being said and being young and full of belief, she did believe that this note could indeed grant her wish.<br />
<br />
Selecting a crayon, she paused as she thought about what her fourteen year old brother, Bobby, had told her. About fifteen minutes ago, she had asked to watch something and Bobby had told her no and that he was watching something.<br />
<br />
Looking at him, she had pleaded to him to let her watch her programme, but he had once again said no...and then added that it was a stupid show she wanted to watch aimed at babies and girls. Pouting she had stuck out her lip and demanded to know what was wrong with girls.<br />
<br />
Looking at her, he had started to explain how all girls were silly and how all they cared about was their stupid girly items. Stamping her foot, she had shouted that it was not true, to which he had picked up one of her dolls and tossing it at her feet, he had said that was a prime example of what girls cared about...dolls and things that were pink and unmanly.<br />
<br />
Looking at the crayon in her hand, noting that it was pink, she asked herself, &quot;What is wrong with pink,&quot; and then knowing what to write, she began.<br />
<br />
'I wish that my brother would slowly turn into a girl. And not just any girl, it would be a younger sister type of girl. One that is four years old. As this happens, I want to slowly turn back into a five year old girl, being the older of the two.<br />
<br />
My brother's change will happen whenever he suddenly is overcome with the urge to do something, as he says it, girly...and he will because it is all part of my wish.<br />
<br />
The first thing to change with be his icky boy parts, but they'll change slowly...lasting about three days before he has girl parts instead of boy parts. And once his wish is done, he will have no rememberance of being a boy, ever.<br />
<br />
As his change slowly happens, he will be totally aware that he is changing, but unable to do anything about it. Everyone else around him, myself not counted because I will be aware of his change, will act as if this is normal...when he acts like a boy, people will treat him like a boy. When he acts like a girl, people will treat him like a girl.<br />
<br />
And he shall enjoy all the things girls like: Dress-up, pretend, dolls, house, tea parties, bright and warm colours (like pink, white, purple and teal) and being with her big sister, me, all the other wonderful things girls like and do. This is my wish...please, please, please, please make it come true.<br />
<br />
Looking at the note, carefully sounding out the words she had written, Abby folded the note, wondering how she would know if the wish came true. After a bit, she took the note over to her bed and picking up her pillow, she placed the note on the bed. Replacing the pillow, she picked up favourite doll and headed for the living room.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Inside the living room, Bobby was channel surfing, unaware that anything strange was about to take place. Flipping through the channels, he paused when he came to one advertising something for My Little Pony. Suddenly mesmerised, he shook his head and pressed the button to change to another channel...to which he came across a programme that had something to do with Barbie.<br />
<br />
Again that feeling of being mesmerised came over him and shaking his head, he quickly changed the channel. On the flickering display, Angelina Ballerina pranced across the screen and suddenly Bobby not only wanted get up and dance like that, but he wanted to play with Abby's Angelina plush. A door closed somewhere and Bobby realised suddenly he had been staring at the programme for about two minutes.<br />
<br />
Clicking off the telly, he asked himself, &quot;What the heck is suddenly the matter with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing, he watched as his sister entered and as the feeling of wanting to be dressed like her fell over him, he made a decision and started to make a hasty exit. As he did, Abby asked him, &quot;Bobby. Would you like to play with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pausing, Bobby felt that feeling intensify and suddenly he wanted to play with Abby. Shaking his head, he replied, &quot;No. I'm going over to Rich's place for a while. Mom should be home soon. If you can't wait, go across the hall to Becca's.&quot; and then began to make his way out of the apartment and down the stairs.<br />
<br />
By passing Rich's, not giving it a second thought, Bobby instead wandered outside, as he did, he once again asked himself, &quot;What the heck is the matter with me all of a sudden?&quot; and as  he stood outside in front of the apartment complex, he failed to notice an odd feeling creeping over his privates. A strange feeling that, had he been paying attention, only grew when the sensation of being mesmerised overcame him and he wanted to do something only a girl would do.</p>
