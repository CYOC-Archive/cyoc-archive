<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a little after 10 pm. A tad past the start of their nightly Internet chat time, when he heard her.<br />
&quot;Hey Eric. Hope I didn&#39;t keep you waiting too long. I just got out of the shower,&quot; said the sweet voice of Julie Stovall over his headphones as her image filled his computer screen.<br />
The bright smile on her face was as much from seeing him as the fact that she could also see Eric&#39;s eyes trying to decide if they were brown or deep sea blue as he stared at her.<br />
Eric Anderson could see his girlfriend&#39;s blonde hair was wet. She had a thick pink bathrobe on and was still running a towel across her face before tying it around her hair. With it just being her and Mrs. Stovall at home right now, Julie wasn&#39;t wearing her headphones, so Eric figured she was listening to him through her computer speakers, but had the microphone somewhere nearby, out of the webcam shot.<br />
A part of him also wondered if the current ensemble was ALL she had on, as he felt a stirring between his legs. But that was far outclassed by the movement of his heart at the vision before him.<br />
&quot;No. Just surfing the net. Everything all right on your end?&quot; he asked into his headset.<br />
&quot;Yeah. With Dad in California taking care of Grandma, Mom needed some help around the house this evening. That&#39;s all,&quot; said Julie. What she didn&#39;t tell him was that they were getting things ready around the pool and cabana in case the &quot;Big Event&quot; actually happened tomorrow.<br />
&quot;How&#39;s she doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine, but uncomfortable. As a were, she should have the cast off by Halloween at the latest, but being around normals with no one knowing that she is a were-mermaid like me, she&#39;ll have to wear it at least until Thanksgiving weekend to keep up appearances, and she isn&#39;t happy about that,&quot; explained Julie.<br />
&quot;And she hurt her leg rollerblading?&quot; asked Eric, noticing that as she was taking care of her hair, Julie&#39;s robe had slipped to expose some of her bare shoulders.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Kind of starting to get up there, age wise, but still as healthy and as athletic as can be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Something we both should hope for.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;ll do just fine,&quot; said Julie, giving Eric a brief wink.<br />
Eric could feel himself blush as he asked, &quot;So. Nine tomorrow morning okay? I still have to attend the Skulk induction ceremony for my folks tomorrow night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. That will give us most of the day together,&quot; Julie said with another large smile. &quot;Mom said that if you bring whatever you&#39;re going to wear tomorrow night with you, she&#39;ll give you a ride there.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? If it isn&#39;t any trouble for her, I accept. Thank her for me, will you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No problem. By the way, if it&#39;s allowable, can you bring a guest to this? I wouldn&#39;t mind accompanying you if I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know if I can bring a date. Nate isn&#39;t taking Alex.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is that because you can&#39;t bring a date or because Alex didn&#39;t want to go?&quot; asked Julie in return.<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted Eric, as he watched Julie shift positions in her chair. Did her robe just further slip to now completely expose her shoulder blades? <i>Should I tell her or just enjoy the view?</i> wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;Well, if I can, I would love to be your date, but I don&#39;t want to get an invite or worm my way in there just because I&#39;m the Mayor&#39;s daughter. If I go, it&#39;s to be with you,&quot; she said with another smile.<br />
&quot;Julie,&quot; began Eric, as he moved a little closer to his monitor, &quot;you can be my date any time any where, but this situation may be out of my hands.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay honey. It&#39;s just that you&#39;re always in here,&quot; said Julie, moving a hand to lay it between her covered breasts, to indicate her heart. &quot;From the moment I first saw you...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. I never realized mine was so empty until you started occupying it,&quot; confessed Eric.<br />
&quot;That is so sweet,&quot; said Julie, as she blew him a kiss.<br />
But as she put her arms back down, Eric noticed that her robe was now more open. Her breasts were still completely covered, but now the valley between them was more visible and enticing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So. What do you actually want to do tomorrow?&quot; asked Eric, trying to change the subject.<br />
<i>You know handsome,</i> thought Julie, as she started to feel herself lose control again. &quot;Well, you&#39;re definitely staying for lunch I presume.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; quickly confirmed Eric.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see. There&#39;s video games. I could give you a tour of the house portions that you haven&#39;t seen during your previous visits,&quot; suggested Julie. <i>Especially my bedroom,</i> she thought, with visions of her and Eric totally water-clad* beginning to run through her head.<br />
&quot;Or we could go swimming,&quot; suggested Eric, as sexual thoughts about the were-mermaid began to fill his head the longer he continued to stare at Julie&#39;s image.<br />
&quot;Well, duh!&quot; said Julie jokingly with a soft laugh. But as she grew silent, Eric saw that her bathrobe had now slipped even further down her arms!<br />
It was now bunched around her elbows as she sat in her desk chair. The nipples were in no way exposed (yet?) but the top swells of her luscious bosom was now quite apparent.<br />
<i>Luscious? Where did that come from?</i> Eric wondered, his thoughts briefly interrupted.<br />
Julie didn&#39;t know why Eric&#39;s eyes suddenly stopped their color change dance. His webcam or microphone didn&#39;t show any disturbances on his end.<br />
She was about to say something when her mother called out, &quot;Julie! Time for bed!&quot;<br />
&quot;Dang. It&#39;s almost eleven. Where did the time go?&quot; Julie wondered out loud.<br />
&quot;There never seems to be enough when I&#39;m with you,&quot; replied Eric.<br />
&quot;I feel the same way,&quot; she agreed with a sigh. &quot;Well, I guess we have to call it a night. See you bright and early at nine tomorrow morning my love,&quot; said Julie, not realizing her exact words as she blew Eric another kiss.<br />
&quot;Until then darling,&quot; agreed Eric, blowing her a kiss before their web transmissions ended.<br />
