<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Alice looked through the menus on the program and browsed the choices of species. She noticed a fantasy subcategory, and had an inspiration. Before she had graduated from high school, some of her friends met occasionally to do role playing. One of her characters had been a satyr, and she remembered how much she enjoyed fantasizing that she was a satyr herself.
<P>Her heart skipped a beat when she saw satyr was one of the choices on the list. She knew she shouldn't have been so surprised. The list was so comprehensive, half of the mythical creatures weren't even known to her.
<P>Upon clicking the satyr option, the menu with her physical stats returned. A slider bar labeled "Satyr" was now included among everything else.
<P>"Okay, I want to be taller again...but maybe not quite as tall as I was." Alice slid the height bar from 3'8" to 4'8". She figured that satyrs, having a goat's bottom half, would be shorter than a normal human.
<P>She saw the satyr bar started out at 0%, which reflected her current status. She slid the bar all the way to 100%.
<P>Unable to wait another second to become her favorite creature of myth, Alice clicked the save button.
<P>The desk began to lower, which Alice realized meant she was growing back up. Now she didn't have to strain her neck and arms so much to use the computer. She felt tickling all over her legs, and instinctively brought her hands down to scratch them. She gasped when they fell upon hundreds of tiny hairs. She threw off her towel and looked down to see coarse brown fur growing on her legs. Her feet, which could touch the ground again, shrank, darkened and hardened into cloven hooves. The shaggy fur grew into a thick coat that covered her completely from the waist down.
<P>Alice felt a twitch from the base of her spine and twisted her upper half around to see for herself a pointy nub that was her new tail. With a newfound reflex, she made it flick up and down. "This is amazing," she blurted out.
<P>She stood up shakily, trying to balance on her new hooves. She noticed how quickly she got used to walking, and assumed she must have been given some new instincts to help her adjust to her satyr body. She broke into a delighted prance and skipped around the room, enjoying the feeling of hooves on the carpet. She dashed down the hall into the bathroom to hear the hooves clopping on the tile floor. It echoed crisply inside the room. Alice smiled gleefully at herself in the mirror. At that moment, seeing her unchanged face smiling back at her, she knew that she wasn't finished changing herself. "I don't want to just have goat's legs," she said. "I want to be even more different."
<P>Back at her computer, Alice looked around in the program to see what else she could do. Underneath the satyr slider, she noticed a word that said "Details." Clicking this brought up a window with a bunch of sliders and fill-in text boxes that corresponded to every single aspect of her satyr form. Hoof size, fur color, and much more. Alice was so excited to see the depth of the customization that she squealed in delight. "This is it," she said.
<P>She found a facial features submenu with sliders for every part of her face. Each one was set to the extreme left, labeled "human." The right side of each slider said "Satyr/Goat." She slid the slider for eyes, nose and mouth 1/4 of the way toward "Satyr/Goat." She slid the slider for ears all the way over. Finally, she increased the freckles slider significantly.
<P>"Okay, let's see what that does," she said. She clicked Save again, and felt a weird but not unpleasant pulling and pinching sensation in the center of her face. She grabbed a small mirror from atop her dresser and looked in it. Her nose had flattened a bit, and her eyes had morphed into something vaguely animalish while retaining basic human appearance. She had gained a cute abundance of freckles. The edges of her mouth had crooked into the beginnings of a muzzle, and she had a cleft in the center of her upper lip that stopped halfway to her nose. Alice snickered at her new goatish face, and suddenly her new long, brown-furred ears popped up from the sides of her head. She realized she could move them up and down, and spin them a little.
<P>"Okay, I think I had too much fun with that," she said a minute later, sitting down at the desk after snapping out of the trance she had fallen into. Playing with her poseable ears had proven a bigger distraction than she expected.
<P>In the program, she looked over other options on her main screen. She selected a new hairstyle for herself, something that would befit a satyr's traditional image. She increased the amount of freckles on her arms and upper chest. Then she pondered the weight slider. She shrugged and clicked it, nudging it up a few pounds. Satyrs were usually seen to be childish in spirit and in form, so she figured a little baby fat would add to the perception.
<P>"Oh, what's this? I can control where the weight goes?" Alice had clicked on the "Details" underneath the weight slider, and a diagram of her body appeared with vertical sliders and arrows that pointed to different parts of her. All of the sliders were at equal settings. She clicked on one and pulled it up, and saw that all of the other sliders went down a miniscule amount. "I see! Heh, then let's put some of those pounds into a nice little belly." She clicked the slider pointing to her stomach and pulled it up. Alice giggled at the thought of having a pudgy stomach. It probably wouldn't be attractive to most people, but it wasn't like she'd be living the rest of her life in this body.
<P>Clicking save, she leaned back in her chair to watch the changes. Freckles appeared like raindrop stains all over her arms, shoulders, and on her chest near her neck. On her back and shoulders, she felt her hair shift about. Her hair was already long and matched the color of her fur, but it was very straight. She had chosen to make it curlier, with more fluff and body, like paintings she had seen of satyrs.
<P>She also felt an odd sensation as her body became a little heavier. It was mostly concentrated in her stomach, but even on her arms and legs she could feel the weight gain take effect. Her body's lean form puffed out, not becoming overweight, but in fact making her look more healthy and well-fed. The big change was in her belly, which had started out with an inward curve she had always been proud of. Pulling up her shirt, Alice saw that curve invert as fat deposited itself in her gut. She patted the small bulge, which felt firm and moved little.
<P>"Nah, let's go bigger," she said. She coaxed the slider for her stomach up a little more, and this time also increased her hips somewhat. She clicked save and felt her stomach push out against the hand that was still resting on it. Now it was halfway to a pudgy pot belly, with a small fold over her waistline. Her goatish hips inflated almost like balloons, creating a pleasing curve. Alice patted her bigger belly and it wobbled gently. She could feel the new pounds tugging at the skin and weighing down her body. "This is kinda cute, actually," she admitted to herself.
<P>She noticed that choosing to increase her weight added a bit of padding to her bust size. She had been a B, but seemed according to the slider to now be almost C size. She glanced down at her breasts and smirked. She then pulled the slider across the line into C territory, and decided to increase the firmness slider as well. She clicked save twice and felt the change take effect. Her breasts swelled a tiny bit more, and began to rise as they firmed up into orbs that proudly rested on her chest.
<P>Alice stood up and looked herself over. She was instantly aware of her extra girth, about twenty pounds of it, and adjusted her balance on her hooves. Her thick and wavy brown hair brushed the tip of her little goat tail, and she brought her arm up underneath it to give it a satisfying toss. She shook her head as the strands floated down around her new form. "Now I feel like a proper satyr," she said, smiling.</p>
