<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s Note: I am fully aware that apes, primates and monkey are separate things entirely. For the sake of the story, I have decided to include all of them as one to give more flexibility for how the story goes so don&#39;t mind how some of the things in the chapter are referenced)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many humans hated being compared to apes, the closest living relatives of human biologically. The gods saw it fitting that apes, the closest to humans, would be a fitting animal for to the switch to occur. Of course the gods knew that apes could follow the same path as human, but a few things could easily change that if it ever happens.<br />
<br />
Back on earth, Daisy was looking after the primates in their enclosure. She mostly looked after the baboons who were quite docile when she was around due to the trust she built up with them. When she had time, she would play with the baboons and feed them extra food.<br />
<br />
That was until the shift. <br />
<br />
When the shift occurred, Daisy was doing some paperwork that she had to do once in a while. She had began to convulse in pain and had fallen onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Her body had began to shrink and change as it took the form of the thing she loved so dear. At her tailbone, a small protrusion eventually grew out into a more length appendage. Her feet had also changed as they looked completely identical to her hands which made it seem like she had four sets of hands.<br />
<br />
Her limbs and spine had also shifted, making her body more comfortable to walk on all four limbs. They also adjusted themselves so Daisy would be able to climb objects and climb trees easily. <br />
<br />
A strange part of the transformation was with her ass and vagina. Her vagina shifted slightly to her anus but that wasn&#39;t the strangest part of the transformation. Her ass had started to swell relative to her diminished stature and took a pink hue. A similar situation happened with Daisy&#39;s pussy as the lips swelled and became massively red and swore looking. It may not be clear as to why this happened, but some baboons have this quality to attract mates more easily, which Daisy would need so here genes get passed on in the new world.<br />
<br />
With the transformation pretty much finished, Daisy had begun to take notice of her new form. She had certainly shrunk, probably about 3&#39;8 or around that height. She wasn&#39;t sure why it had happened and she was certainly panicking, but there was a bit of intrigue in it. Why had this happened was something she thought of.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were quickly cut off though as she heard strange noises coming from outside. Climbing onto a window frame with her new body, she watched as various different people were running around being chased by apes, monkey or primates.<br />
<br />
The odd thing about it was that the human looked like apes, primates or monkeys. Some were swinging around with incredible long tails, longer then her own; while one man looked like a gorilla with incredibly muscular arms. The weirder thing was that the humans were making noises that were akin to the animal they looked like.<br />
<br />
For the primates, apes and what not; it seemed as if they were trying to capture the humans.  Their bodies were more akin to a normal human as they walked upright and on two legs. The female looking ones had properly developed breasts (which Daisy now lacked) and the make ones had obvious bulges in their pants. All of them were wearing zookeeper uniforms and had equipment that Daisy was trained to use in emergencies. It was an odd sight, especially when a baboon in a uniform was chasing her college Jake.<br />
<br />
Infact, Jake looked quite lovely was what daisy was thinking. That large pink as of his with his dick dangling between his legs as he ran was a site. She couldn&#39;t help herself as she made mating call noises that were for a baboon, but in her mind it was to call for Jake&#39;s courtship. At that point she realised a flaw in her description, all the humans were naked.<br />
<br />
At that point, she realised she was naked. She somehow felt quite alright without clothes on and she didn&#39;t notice she wasnt wearing jeans or panties as her large pink as cushioned her body. Amidst the panic of her indecency, a female baboon had wandered into the office. Her face was that of pure glee which seemed to make Daisy feel safer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, Daisy. I wondered where you ran off to. Seemed you wanted to greet me while I work, well I&#39;m sorry but you have to go back to your enclosure.&quot; The female baboon said in a voice that sounded almost like Daisy&#39;s human voice.<br />
<br />
Daisy didn&#39;t seem to care thought as this baboon seemed to make Daisy extremely relaxed. She felt safe around the baboon but she didn&#39;t question why or if she should feel like this. It didn&#39;t matter though as the baboon zookeeper picked Daisy up and took her to a large cage.</p>
