<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia put out the flyers for her little “public” adult function weeks in advance. Of course, these flyers were specially made to only attract a particular kind of person. Anyone else would just see some random advertisement or some such in its place. Couldn’t risk attracting the wrong sort of people for various reasons of course. And so it was that she would find herself at the last round of her specially arranged Easter Egg Hunt. These were the finalists competing for the “Grand Prize” of the evening. Each one was effected to believe that all the losers had gone home for the evening. Couldn’t let them in on the truth even at this stage of everything now, could she?<br />
<br />
Lined up before her was a set of six contestants; A matronly figured woman with sizable breasts and wide hips, her dark brown eyes gleaming with a cautious determination. A pair of college girls with figures so similar to one another except their hair and eyes telling them apart as much as they stare at each other in contempt. A bookish young woman with dark hair attempting to cover her glasses. A tall, tanned, and muscled woman looking quite pleased with herself. Then finally, a classic example of the standards of beauty, the buxom bombshell.<br />
<br />
“The rules of this last round are simple, ladies~ Whoever finds the largest egg and brings it back will be declared the winner of the Grand Prize!” Selicia raised the dollar store toy pistol above her head before using magic to make a loud bang. Off the group of women scattered across the property outside her home. The most recent acquirement of property being fitted with a beautiful fielding of trees for the event. With the contestants comfortably on their way, Selicia made her own way on her own last task of the evening.<br />
<br />
From this point forward, the story will shift from contestant to contestant being experienced through their own characters.<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Bethany: A thirty-seven-year-old mother of two. Her body still carrying the effects of motherhood leaving her breasts enlarged and her body a little plumper than it had been. Her light brown hair pulled into a braided ponytail and her freckled face sporting soft dark brown eyes. She wore blue jeans and a white blouse now covered in green stains just for this event.<br />
<br />
Bethany wandered straight toward the thicker grouping of trees she’d seen from the earlier round. If they were going to hide a larger egg than before, it would be there… Right? Though the “Grand Prize” hadn’t been disclosed, she was hoping that it would be something she could use for her family. The holiday was still a few days off but, they hadn’t really prepared much for it. They were sort of relying on events like these to make things happen. With that thought burning in her mind she pushed deeper into the trees.<br />
When she reached the deeper part of the woods, the sun was barely showing through the leaves making the place a little darker. She squinted through the shade looking in the branches, roots, and knotholes of all she could see. Humming thoughtfully, she looked around as she walked further still, did she overthink the event? There just had to be an egg hiding around her some- Her thoughts cut short as she spotted the pastel blue of a rounded shape in a bush. Ha! She did find one here after all and it was pretty big too! A little bit bigger than a football, it had to be the one they were out to find. She walked closer to the egg feeling giddy to her ears that she’d won. Within reach of the item, she felt a stiff breeze blow through the trees. The cold wind cut right through her clothes so easily… or so she’d thought.<br />
The egg had come open in the wind drawing her attention before she’d seen that her pantleg was gone baring her leg to the world. She tried to stand up but, she couldn’t… Looking around with her eyes is about all she could do now. That was how she found out that she’d been stripped completely bare by something. Panic set itself firmly into her mind as she struggled to move. Finally, her body seemed to be waking up as her arm pulled away from the egg. A sigh of relief came quickly as she felt it just a waking dream.<br />
This relief was short lived as she felt her body taking up a pose she didn’t think of. She felt like she was now squatting down with her legs spread wide. The pose should’ve been impossible for her to hold but, she was doing just that as her hands made fists and pressed into her breasts on the sides. What came to scare her more than anything else was the egg started to loom over her as if it was growing larger by the second. A flash of realization came to her too late as the opened egg rolled over her and began to close around her. It hadn’t gotten bigger at all; she’d gotten that much smaller. With a pop, the egg snapped shut throwing Bethany into darkness. A moment later it was jostled as it was picked up causing Bethany to fall over inside with a “hefty” clunk.<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
Jazlyn: A twenty-five-year-old female body builder. She’d taken swiftly to the mindset of her body as a temple. That temple was painstakingly sculpted by her hard work for years now. All that muscle nearly caused her B cups to blend in with them but, she didn’t care. Her black hair was twisted into dreads and pulled back to keep out of her brown eyes to keep them only on the prize. She’d towered over the rest of the women except for that judge who could see her eye to eye… For this showing she’d chosen her black workout clothes with the green highlights.<br />
<br />
Jazlyn made her way across the front of the property thinking that there might be a trick in play. Why would they make the “Grand Prize” so easy to find? Making it the biggest just made the search so much easier. No, no… It would have to be the smallest egg of all. Yes… That was the whole idea, test of mind as well as awareness. Well that she could do as well for she was no slouch like the rest. Ha ha ha! She’d emerge victorious and claim yet another prize for herself.<br />
She ran to the other side of the property and along the side of the manor and started lifting anything she thought they might use to hide it. Potted plants… Wooden boxes… Bags full of leaves… All of it would make way for her and her search. Upon lifting a stone bench, she’d seen a speck of color that seemed out of place just down from her. Ah! There it was, a tiny pink egg nestled in a pile of brightly colored rags. A triumphant chuckle echoed from her chest as she confidently strode toward the egg. With a few more steps taken, she felt shock run through her as the egg lay open before her. Had this just been an accidental left over? No… That couldn’t be true… Still she felt herself drawn toward it needing something of it.<br />
That draw became stronger with each step closer until it became much more than that… It -pulled- on her stronger than she had time to consider. Turning away from the egg and its mysterious force pulling on her, she made to run from it. Three hard won strides was all she got before she felt her left leg stretch behind her. As she turned her head back to see, her right leg was swept from under her. Digging her fingers into the soft dirt, she stole a look back… Her legs were stretched impossibly long and thin -into- the tiny egg. She shook her head in disbelief and started dragging herself as hard as she could away.<br />
The egg would not have this escape however… It’s effort redoubled and Jazlyn felt her waist stretch and thin out as her legs had. She dug deeper into the dirt with her fingers straining against the pull and suddenly it felt easier. Grinning with grim determination she let go of the ground with one hand to throw it as far forward as she could. That’s when the pull returned again stronger than before and swallowed that limb in a blink. Her one free hand dug five thin trails in the dirt as she lost the fight. Everything she could see suddenly stretched to impossible lengths before she was suddenly wrapped up in herself literally. After she’d been coiled tightly, her faced planted firmly in her stretched crotch, the egg closed. Moments later the egg was picked up and gently squeezed against her stretched thin body.<br />
<br />

<br />
April is a twenty-two-year-old college student attending the nearby college. She was proud of her platinum blonde her and gray colored eyes making her unique! Though she stood only at five foot four and her body had the curves of a rail… She’d come out in a sundress of white to match her natural looks.<br />
Summer is a twenty-three-year-old college student also attending the nearby college. Her curly red locks framed her emerald eyes gorgeously. Yet… Her stature was a mere five foot four and she was built like a fence post… She’d come here in a red checkered shirt and blue cut off shorts to accentuate her better features.<br />
<br />
April and Summer refused to let the other get the upper hand in this contest. So where one walked the other followed close behind. After trying to lose the other several times, they gave up and just decided to keep the other close at hand. They’d gotten separated in previous rounds and hoped that they would come fact to face in the finals. Rivals to the core they were… The other thought they were -so- much better than they were… Well now they’d prove that bitch wrong!<br />
<br />
The property was large and that meant there was a lot of ground to cover. Sure that meant it was easier to split up and cover more ground but… What if that bitch found the egg first?! No, they weren’t going to let that happen. It was a simple plan really, so simple that the other wouldn’t ever see it coming~ They were going to snatch the egg from them and take off before they knew what hit them! Now all they had to do was find the egg fir- There it was a yellow egg nearly blending into the flowers around it… And… It… Was… Mine! They felt another hand brush theirs and turned their head to come face to face with that bitch!<br />
The pair settled into a catfight right there on the ground before the egg. April bit Summer’s arm, Summer kicked April’s shin, and so on it went. A stray flail of an arm popped the egg open before them but, they were too preoccupied with the other to care. It might’ve helped them to have noticed as their sides melted to the ground they lay on. The egg, a foot in length, greedily consuming what they lost. Still the pair fought with eyes locked onto the other’s as they violently beat them. Summer’s arm swung slowly and somehow missed April’s side, April headbutt Summer which felt as if her head molded to the blow… As the feeling of “exhaustion” took the pair, they huffed defiantly at the other.<br />
<br />
By now the pair’s limbs were half consumed and their sides slanting away from the egg as the stream drew around them. It wasn’t until there was a look of confusion on the other’s face that they’d noticed what was happening. Too late, they pair watched the other melting away as the ineffectually flailed their heads to get away. Seeing the panic they felt mirrored by the other drove them even deeper into despair as they felt their faces mix into the soup of the other’s. With what felt like a kiss goodbye, the two found the egg close about them, the soup of their bodies coagulating into a new shape. The egg was picked off the ground and they heard a muffled voice say something like “Hadn’t expected that…”<br />
<br />

<br />
Gracie was a twenty-six-year-old amateur model. Her looks are what carried her for her whole life. Golden blonde hair down her back, sparkling blue eyes, and that highly sought-after hourglass figure~ All of that was hers to show off and use to get whatever she’d wanted. She’d come out today in a baby blue halter top and a short white skirt.<br />
If she could always get what she wanted then, why was she here? Someone might ask her? Well, she just happened to be in the neighborhood so she thought she might mingle with the common folk. She strut through the property maintaining that air of superiority as she looked around. She was a bit sore that the judge had stolen all of her attention… Sure, she’d had a few passes made on her but, that raven haired woman commanded attention as much as she turned it away. It made her fume but, she wasn’t going to let it show. Who was the model after all? Not her~<br />
Turning the corner of the mansion, she made her way along the patio. That’s where she found her winning egg before so that’s where she’d look again. Looking about the tables, the plants, and seating, she found nothing… She was disappointed to say the least, didn’t they know that she should win? If they wanted good PR, they’d let her… Tossing herself into a chair she crossed her arms and huffed in annoyance. Annoyance edged back over a few minutes and she looked up to the sky. There it was! A pastel green egg the size of the kind filled with stockings was seated in a hanging pot. Looking around for a tool to help, she found a garden hoe and swung. It took a few tries as to not break the pot but, the egg finally fell free.<br />
Confetti spewed at her feet as the egg burst open on contact with ground. Gracie hopped up and down cheering happily. She found the winning egg! She was sure of it! While she cheered however, she didn’t feel her hair split down the middle of her back nor it sliding off into the egg. One arm tiredly felt to her side dangling at first before falling like cloth to the floor. It wasn’t until her feet buckled and she fell to the floor that she noticed… Her body was hollowing out as the egg slid toward her.<br />
A scream failed to peel out of her sore throat as her upper thighs were consumed by the egg. Still she wiggled her hips gaining an inch or two before even those flattened. She wasn’t alarmed by seeing her trimmed golden bush rumpled inside the egg as her clothing had vanished entirely. The only thoughts she harbored were those of someone, anyone coming to save her. Thoughts that seemed to be granted as a pair of black shoes walked toward her. Putting on her best smile as she reached to grab hold of that white stockinged ankle. Only to receive a broom’s bristles to her face sweeping her effortlessly toward the egg. A tear left her eye was the egg closed around her crumpled form. Muffled from the outside she heard, “Mistress… This one made… Excessive noise… So I came to investigate…” “That’s fine, Lisa Darling, you did nothing but, your duty~”<br />
<br />

<br />
Paige was a thirty-year-old librarian for the local city library. She didn’t have much to look at with her ombre hair cut in a long bob. It always threatened to cover her glasses with left her hazel eyes in an unfortunate scowl. As far as the rest of her went, she kept her almost C cup breasts smothered in a thick sweater that made her look like a walking post.<br />
<br />
Paige adjusted her glasses venturing deeper into the tall garden out back of the manor. If they were to hide a large egg, why not hide it in a sea of color? She scoured the flowers and plants with a scrutiny honed by searching shelves for books for years. This was her talent in such contests and for certain was she going to use it. Further into the almost maze-like garden she went as lost herself in the search. Her blood racing with each turn, she could almost feel herself getting closer.<br />
<br />
She turned another corner and was met with a pair of maids sweeping up fallen petals. One of them seemed to move just the slightest bit mechanically but, she might just be a bit stiff that day. Excusing herself past the duo, she could swear they were watching her go as if they were expecting something. It couldn’t be anything like that Paige assured herself. But maybe… Maybe that was a subtle hint that she was on the right track! Stepping up her hustle, she turned one more corner and came face to face with a human sized lavender egg!<br />
It was enormous! No wonder they’d hidden it here, anywhere else would’ve been too easy. Only marveling at the size of the egg a short moment longer as she approached. Her hands touched the sides of the egg and she tried to heft it from its resting spot. The large thing wouldn’t even budge an inch let alone how heavy the thing must be. How on Earth were you supposed to bring this thing back? That was cheating! They rigged the whole event; it was a total sham! She stamped her feet feeling the grass between her toes and her breasts bouncing with the motion… Wait… What? She looked down at herself and found her clothes completely gone! As she made to cover herself, a shadow loomed over her from behind. She turned in time to see the egg opened around her and snap shut before she could react.<br />
Inside of the egg, she slammed herself against the cold plastic trying to get free. The more she tried the less her efforts seemed to do anything to it. Maybe she’d wind up for one last throw before she banged for help. Surely those two maids would hear her, right? Ok… Three… Two… O-! Just as she made to bash against the egg’s interior again, a metal rod shut up from the bottom and wedged itself perfectly and deep into her sex. She gasped in shock from the sudden intrusion and the cold thereof. As she made to pull off of the rod, it warmed to a tingle and then to an orgasm inducing heat. Her eyes rolled, her mouth and vagina drooling, all the while her limbs froze in place. Soon she couldn’t move or even think with that rod inside her. Something lifted the egg though and she heard a loud yet muffled voice say, “Congratulations! You’re the Grand Prize!”<br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Selicia picked up the last and now tiny lavender egg as she made her way back to the patio. She might’ve been a bit selective of the finalists but, were they going to complain? If so, to who~? Once she reached the patio, she sat down with the basket of eggs awaiting her at the table sitting next to a sizeable pile of dildos and vibrators. As expected she’d drawn quite a few males with the intent to make her their prize… Now to open up her prizes from her lovely contestants~<br />
<br />
First to be opened was the football sized blue egg. With a pop, she pulled out the contents within. A chocolate bunny with a few creamy leaks or so it looked at a glance. Closer inspection revealed the squatting form of Bethany with bunny ears in the classic pose for the front facing candy. A wide ecstatic smile on her face as the cream filling dribbled just slightly out of her tiny nipples and vagina. The details were perfect as to be expected of Selicia’s handicraft. She sat the milk chocolate treat down on the table and moved to the next egg.<br />
Now the pink egg was the smallest of all by far. She loved the irony of giving it to the largest of all to find. Popping it open made this crimson sheened fabric blossom like a rose. Tugging it out of the half of the egg revealed it to be a crimson silk set of underwear. A beautifully designed crimson bra with elegant swirls just where the nipples would settle. The panties sported a designed the radiated out of the center of the crotch, a small red knotted bow adorning the top center. A brute she may have been but, exquisite lingerie she did make~<br />
The next egg to be opened was the midsized yellow egg. Now this one would be a surprised even to Selicia herself. She hadn’t counted on the pair going for the same egg. She’d even placed the second nearby in expectation that they’d split up. And yet, here they were in a single egg, mingled together… Opening the egg, she found what she’d expected to find but with a twist… A standard silicone fleshlight tube but, marbled by the pairs’ complexions. Even the opening was split mostly in half with either lip being different in color and shape from the other. The clit was a swirl of both flesh tones and the faux tuft of hair shaped like a heart was split evenly between their hair colors. Half almost silver and the other a deep red. She’d planned on selling this one but, seeing the oddity of it, well, she could always make another to sell.<br />
The fourth egg was the green one that Lisa had assisted the contestant into. It was true that she had made quite the ruckus and had to be silenced quickly. Pulling that egg apart, she was greeted with the sight of a pastel yellow bunny girl suit. White thigh high stockings, buckle shoes, arm sleeves, and bunny ears came out first. The main suit itself made from fine silk of pastel yellow and a tiny white tuft tail just above the ass. Leave it to a model to know fashion best, eh?<br />
With the final egg ready to be opened, Selicia tossed it to the floor where the contents burst out to full size. The bookish girl looked as if she was frozen in ecstasy atop that metal rod. Her legs curled up and a wet sheen on the pole, her vagina, and her mouth still evident. Selicia stood up to make further adjustments to this one, as she was, she would not do. The change to doll made her breasts expand beyond a C to a D, after all she’d need it to fill out her new uniform. She extended her hair down past her middle back just for preference too. Next her pose was changed to something more passive and her eyes rolled back down.<br />
<br />
Once her pose was adjusted, Selicia pulled her off the rod with a wet pop and started fitting the bunny girl outfit to her. It fit her perfectly, now all she’d need is a sign and she’s ready for the store~ Fitting her back on her stand took a moment as the suit’s crotch had to be pulled out and to the side of her gaping lips. She’d need to be lubricated every so often to keep her from permanently sticking to the rod… Sure she could be made to always be lubricated~ But, that might risk the wrong attention… Leaving her sex to be viewed to the world, well… Only a select group might actually pay enough attention to notice that. Selicia gave that excited clit a small push like a button and felt the woman roil in pleasure inside her own body.<br />
“Go ahead and take this one down to the store and put this lingerie on a rack too.” Selicia instructed Lisa who bowed slightly before picking up the doll and underwear. Carrying the chocolate and fleshlight into the manor, Selicia took a deep contented breath. She really did just catch that holiday spirit~</p>
