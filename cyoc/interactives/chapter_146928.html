<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When breakfast was done Mike left the dorm with Lewis, leaving Tiffany alone with orders to wash the pots and plates she&#39;d used to make his food. She was happy to oblige as going through the soothing rhythm of the daily chores calmed her nerves for what she was about to do. Tiffany knew her room-mate&#39;s schedules well enough to say they&#39;d both be gone for at least a couple of hours, and Zack still wasn&#39;t due back until the afternoon; she wasn&#39;t looking forward to having to explain who she was to him. Still, she was more or less guaranteed a good window of privacy, assuming no-one came looking for her old self of course. Technically she should have been out at class herself, but she wasn&#39;t about to turn up to a lecture hall in her current state and act like nothing was wrong. <br />
<br />
Leaving the Kitchen sparkling, Tiffany ran to Mike&#39;s bedroom and slammed face first into the locked door she tried to open. Of course he&#39;d keep it locked! She scolded herself and racked her brain for a solution while trying not to panic. Suddenly struck by inspiration she ran back to her own room and grabbed her phone to call the building&#39;s maintenance guy.<br />
<br />
“Hello, what&#39;s the problem” Came a board sounding male voice as the call went through. <br />
<br />
“Hi, my name&#39;s Tiffany; I&#39;m Mike&#39;s umm... girlfriend. He&#39;s from Dorm number 6” Tiffany said, tripping over the word slightly as the absurdity of what she was saying struck her. “I left something of mine in his room and I can&#39;t find him; would you be able to open his door for me real quick?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, not like there&#39;s enough I&#39;ve gotta do around here” he said before hanging up. <br />
<br />
Tiffany, feeling a wave of relief that her idea worked, set about waiting for him to arrive. After a few minutes passed the front door opened and a middle aged balding man in blue overalls walked through. “That&#39;s quite the outfit you&#39;ve got” he said as he saw Tiffany by Mike&#39;s door, closing the one he&#39;d come through behind him. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I suppose” Tiffany replied with a nervous laugh.<br />
<br />
“Well anyway, I can&#39;t open someone&#39;s bedroom door without their permission so give me a moment to call this boyfriend of yours”.<br />
<br />
“No wait” Tiffany almost shouted with a stab of fear in her guts. “OK the truth is I wanted to get into his room to surprise him, today&#39;s our one month anniversary you see, that&#39;s why I dressed up like this for him; he&#39;s got a thing for me being his little maid. If he knew I was here it would spoil the surprise. <br />
<br />
“Is that right?” The maintenance guy said, staring down at her with a raised eyebrow. “Well like I said there&#39;s no opening that door without the occupants permission. Unless of course you do me a favour in return”.<br />
<br />
“What do you want?” Tiffany asked, a note of concern creeping into her voice as she noticed the growing budge in his overalls.<br />
<br />
“Oh nothing too much. It&#39;s gonna be long day and seeing a sweet little thing like you all dressed up like that does things to a man, so here&#39;s the deal. You give me a nice handful of those perky cans of yours and I&#39;ll open the door for you and give you my word that no-one outside this room will hear about any part of our exchange or your having broken in this far. Take it or leave it”. <br />
<br />
With a sigh at the implied threat Tiffany lowered her dress and undid her bra exposing the breasts she&#39;d so recently been forced to carry. “Just don&#39;t take too long” Tiffany said, silently lamenting how one tracked the minds of the men she encountered seemed to be.<br />
<br />
With a stupid grin plastered to his face the blue clad man stepped up to her and she looked to the side as she felt a pair of calloused hands take hold of her chest. “That&#39;s good; nice and soft” he said as he rolled one of her nipples between his thumb and forefinger. Tiffany stood there for what felt like hours enduring his touch until he finally give a big squeeze and released her then took a step back. “I think that&#39;ll do me for now” he said continuing to stare at her exposed tits with his wide grin. “And I&#39;m a man of my word, give me sec and I&#39;ll have that door right open”.<br />
<br />
Tiffany stepped to the side and recovered herself as the maintenance man fumbled with his key chain trying to find the right one. “There you go” he said with a note of victory as the door swung open. “You two have fun and if you ever need another favour you know where to find me” he said giving a wink as he left. <br />
<br />
Now re-clothed Tiffany shuddered at the thought of having to go through that a second time. Pushing the thought down she ran to Mike&#39;s cupboard and dug around in the piles of clothes until she claimed her prize. Rushing back to her own room she locked the door and summoned Beldazarr as fast as she could. Smoke poured from the lamp and the Djinn quickly formed himself in front of her. “Greeting Mistress, have you a wish for me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! I wish I was back to normal!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m afraid that cannot be done Mistress. I have not the power to undo my own magic and as your own master wished for you to be a woman, a woman you shall remain”.<br />
<br />
Tiffany&#39;s blood turned to ice as his words rolled over her.<br />
<br />
“What?” she managed to say at barely above a whisper. “You mean I&#39;m stuck like this? As nothing but a... a servant to be fucked and thrown aside whenever Master&#39;s bored with me?”<br />
<br />
“I did not say that. While my magic has sealed you in this form and placed shackles on your mind your master mealy wished for your obedience, the exact nature of that obedience however is his to lay forth or rescind”.<br />
<br />
“Fat lot of good that does me!” She shouted, the anger at having her one lifeline ripped away now spilling out. “He&#39;s the one who made me his fuck toy in the first place, he&#39;s not about to just let me go!”<br />
<br />
“As things stand now you are likely correct Mistress, however do not forget that you currently hold that lamp and thus have the means to change that”. <br />
<br />
“You&#39;re right” she said, calming down as potential ideas raced through her mind. “First though I want that creepy maintenance guy to completely forget everything that happened between him and me; I don&#39;t want him tipping Master off before I&#39;m ready and I don&#39;t trust him to keep quiet forever”.<br />
<br />
“It is done; he no longer recalls any part of his encounter with you Mistress.”<br />
<br />
“Second, if there&#39;s no way for me to go back to my male life I want to at least be properly comfortable in my skin. I wish I felt natural in this body and I wish had the knowledge I would if this is how I grew up.<br />
<br />
“So you say, so it shall be”.<br />
<br />
Tiffany gasped as foreign memories invaded her mind, an intense unrelenting flood of new things forced their way in settling alongside her old life. A flash of an early birthday party where she proudly modelled for the guests the pretty pink dress she&#39;d been given; looking at herself in the mirror of her parents bedroom as she clumsily smeared herself with make-up; with a group of friend at a sleep over as they giggled into the night at how icky the boys were; with her mother in an underwear shop trying on a training bra; sitting through the birds and the bees talk while holding a small pile of menstrual products after her first period started; sneaking off to kiss a boy behind the school bike shed on a dare from her friends; dancing with him in the beautiful dress she&#39;d spent hours choosing for the senior prom.  <br />
<br />
Hot happy tears rolled down her cheeks as Tiffany sank to the floor and experienced an entire childhood in only a few moments. Her body no longer felt imposed on her like a prison of unfamiliar flesh; it was truly hers, she&#39;d grown up with it; knew every curve and every blemish. She hugged herself and simply enjoyed the feeling of contentment with herself as she allowed the tears to flow. Her old life may be gone forever, but now she was resolved to forge this new one into something she would be proud to live; and that meant taking care of business.<br />
<br />
Wiping her eyes she turned to Beldazarr with a renewed fire in her heart. “Thank you; I feel so much better now”.<br />
<br />
“You are welcome Mistress. Now, I presume you have further wishes”.</p>
