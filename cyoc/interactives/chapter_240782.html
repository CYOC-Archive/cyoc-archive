<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Content warning fart content in the second half of this chapter</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a few months since Lace woke up in Ash&#39;s laundry basket. in total Lace had been Ash&#39;s panties around ten times now. Despite her promise however she had yet to let him keep his mind intact. She keeps saying he&#39;s not ready yet which could be true, but on a certain level Lace believed she was the one having difficulty with the idea. So Lace hasn&#39;t pushed the issue yet; besides he could tell she liked him, and if she wanted to keep him he was sure she&#39;d come around eventually.<br />
<br />
 Lace had taken responsibility for the whole missing persons debacle. He just had to tell the police it was his idea and they&#39;d leave Ash alone. The only consequence was the school is requiring he attend tf counseling. Which is where Lace is now; sitting in the waiting room of a tf counselor affiliated with the college: Prof. Brianne Winters.<br />
<br />
The walls of the room are plastered in brightly colored posters featuring catchy slogans. Things like “Practice Safe T.Fs.” which features a cartoon image of a woman wearing a whole outfit; every item of which has its own smiling face. Another poster reads “Know the Risks: Don&#39;t Mix Science and Magic.” followed by a list of the potential dangerous side effects. There&#39;s a coffee table in the center of the room piled high with back issues of T.Fs Weekly, and other less thematically appropriate magazines. A TV was bolted into the wall in the far corner of the room, and as far as Lace could tell was permanently set to the food network. <br />
<br />
Lace could only stand to watch so much of Bobby Flay before sinking into his chair bored out of his mind. His eyes wandered down to his arm and curiously he tugged at the sleeve of his hoodie to reveal the bare skin of his wrist. The skin there was noticeably discolored, a light purple. Anyone else might mistake it for a bruise, but Lace knew better. He could just barely make out a faint pattern as well. It was a series of stars and clouds; the same print that covered his body in his natural panty form. He had only seen it so far in a selfie Ash had shown him. <br />
<br />
He was a pair of cotton lavender bikini cut panties. His body was covered in a print of little yellow stars arranged like constellations. His trim was a darker purple lace the same as his waistband. He was told that he even had the tiniest, most delicate looking bow on his front. Though the picture he had seen was only from the rear; it featured Ash&#39;s absolutely massive ass which he seemed almost too small for. <br />
<br />
He was indeed the opposite of what Ash normally wore. Lace had “met” the rest of her underwear collection early on. She had insisted on calling them his “sisters” something he was sure she found hilarious. There was apparently some merit to it however, as from what Lace had read many people with R.T.F.S do claim to be able to hear the voices of their fellow objects. The current leading theory being that they contain the souls of reincarnated people.<br />
<br />
 Most of them were pretty plain; plain black panties, some Calvin Kleins, boyshorts, and even some straight up boxers. By comparison he was the cutest, girliest pair the overgrown tomboy wore. Something she was keen on teasing him about, though he did get the impression she preferred the more feminine styles. Lace wondered if on some level Ash had felt forced into a tomboy box, and through Lace she might be connecting to an inner femininity she repressed. He wasn&#39;t sure though she hadn&#39;t decided his form; neither of them had. Tfrm has a library of a few hundred different styles and assigns them based on a brain scan that happens just before the transformation.<br />
<br />
“Michael? Michael Lacey, are you ready?”<br />
<br />
Lace looked up to see Prof. Winters standing in the doorway of her office. She was a middle-aged woman. Blonde hair kept in a bob framing a beautiful yet mature face with only the smallest of wrinkles just starting to show up. She wore a blue satin blouse buttoned all the way up, a pencil skirt, and sheer nylons clinging tightly to some of the longest legs Lace had ever seen. <br />
<br />
“Oh right, that&#39;s me.” Lace shot up and followed her into her office; a cozy little room with bookshelves lined top to bottom with texts on the science and history of tfs. On the wall hung multiple degrees including PHDs in psychology, anthropology, and transformative studies. Lace sat awkwardly on one end of what looked to be the most expensive couch he&#39;d ever seen. Prof. Winters sat opposite him in her own chair; her legs crossed and a notepad in her hands.<br />
<br />
“Now I understand you had a little incident with the Tfrm app.” She was already taking notes before Lace said a word. “Um yeah, about three months ago now… I met a girl at a party, she needed new underwear and well I was there.”<br />
<br />
The only sound in the room was the scratching of the pen as Prof Winters took her notes. “I was under the impression you were the initiator in this case.”<br />
<br />
“Well I saw she was in distress and offered to help” He was cut off. “And your owner took that as an offer to fill in for her panties?”<br />
<br />
“No, well, Ash isn&#39;t my owner, we&#39;re just friends.” More scratching. “She was drunk and she wasn&#39;t in the right mindset…”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re making excuses for her.” Lace stopped dead as the Woman across from him stared right through him. <br />
<br />
“I am.” Lace admitted. “Even if I know what she did was wrong, I don&#39;t want her to get in trouble.”<br />
<br />
Prof Winters didn&#39;t say anything at first. She let the silence hang in the air for what felt like forever before checking something off in her notes. “If that&#39;s how you feel I&#39;ll respect your wishes. Now please continue.”<br />
<br />
Lace felt an odd sense of relief for some reason. “I was her panties for a month, before the auto reversal feature kicked in.” <br />
<br />
“You&#39;re quite lucky in that regard, you know. They only implemented that safeguard this year; previously if you were forgotten you&#39;d have been stuck for good.” Lace hadn&#39;t known that even now the thought that he could have spent an eternity as a mindless pair of panties hadn&#39;t occurred to him. “Did you enjoy your time as her panties?” <br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t remember it. Ash wasn&#39;t totally comfortable with the idea of having my face in her genitals so she turned my mind off.” More notes. “That&#39;s quite normal for a first timer, it probably did you some good actually. Have you experienced any withdrawal symptoms?”<br />
<br />
“None but…” Prof Winters looked up. “But?”<br />
<br />
“I haven&#39;t exactly had the chance to have withdrawal. Ash still wears me pretty regularly. “ Prof Winters raised an eyebrow. “I thought you said she wasn&#39;t your owner?” <br />
<br />
“She&#39;s not, we&#39;re just friends. I sub in for her underwear sometimes is all.” Even Lace would admit how flimsy that excuse sounded. “So you wish to continue being panties then?”<br />
<br />
“Is that weird?” Lace asked vulnerably. “Not at all. It&#39;s quite natural actually. People have been transforming for tens of thousands of years. We quite literally evolved to do so.”<br />
<br />
“we did?” Prof Winters smirked as she got up and pulled a book off the shelf. “The current leading theory is that it&#39;s a response to stress and overpopulation. Even in societies devoid of magic and modern science spontaneous transformation is common in times of famine or hardship.”<br />
<br />
She handed Lace the book; it was a hefty text on the prevalence of transformation in Papuan tribes coauthored by Andrew Coltrane and Brianne Winters. “When there are too many mouths to feed one of the mouths becomes that which feeds the rest. I saw it happen with my own eyes. Once the eldest daughter of a family I was staying with became a pig which fed the rest of us. She was quite tasty barbecued.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s brutal.” Lace remarked as he studied the cover. “It is but survival often has to be. We&#39;re fortunate to live in a society where tfs are a luxury not a necessity.” <br />
<br />
“I guess so. But even still it&#39;s not like we&#39;re in a situation where I have to keep being Ash&#39;s underwear. She has plenty of others.” Prof Winters looked somewhat annoyed. “You don&#39;t get it. You&#39;re no different from that girl. You might not have chosen to be panties; just as she didn&#39;t choose to be a pig, but at that moment you were needed as panties. You gained purpose in your friend&#39;s need for clean underwear.” <br />
<br />
Lace wasn&#39;t quite buying it. It sounded nice on paper but Lace knew his motivations were less than wholesome. “Purpose? I think you&#39;re thinking a little too hard about this. I&#39;m really just trying to get in Ash&#39;s pants.” <br />
<br />
“On a certain level you might be. But let me ask you this. Has Ash transformed you with your mind still intact yet?” Lace was alarmed. Ash hadn&#39;t but how did she know that? “Not yet but she&#39;ll get around to it. She&#39;s just not ready yet.”<br />
<br />
“How cruel you let her use you but she doesn&#39;t let you experience the use. And even so you still defend her.” Lace was getting defensive. “It&#39;s not her fault. She&#39;s just scared.”<br />
<br />
“scared?” She pressed. “Yeah well being panties is no walk in the park right? I think she&#39;s scared I&#39;ll get grossed out and won&#39;t want to stay her underwear.”<br />
<br />
“Well that&#39;s a good question then are you prepared for that? I mean I know I certainly put my panties through a lot. Are you really ready for the sweat, urine, even blood and feces that comes along with the job?” Lace began to shrink slightly into his chair. “Have you ever taken a fart to the face? You know that&#39;s the true purpose of panties right? you&#39;re meant for her hygiene not to look sexy” Lace&#39;s stomach turned as he became flustered. “No… wait, listen I&#39;m not stupid. I&#39;m aware of that possibility yeah but it&#39;s not like Ash is that dirty of a person I&#39;m sure I can handle whatever she throws at me.”<br />
<br />
Despite his outward bravado, internally Lace admitted to himself he wasn&#39;t sure how he&#39;d feel about their arrangement until he experienced it first hand. “Well then why don&#39;t we put that to the test then kneel down on the floor for me will you.”<br />
<br />
“wait wha…” Lace was taken aback as the professor stood up before him and began undoing her skirt. “You can&#39;t be serious, you can&#39;t wear me, that&#39;s so inappropriate.”<br />
<br />
“Of course not, I&#39;m not going to wear another woman&#39;s underwear that&#39;d be disgusting.” Despite her words Prof Winters skirt still came off and soon the much older woman was standing before Lace expectantly. A bright red lace thong peeking out from the massive globes of her ass mere inches from the blushing student&#39;s face. “I told you to kneel.”<br />
<br />
Lace dropped to his knees without question. He had never been into milfs but suddenly being presented with the opportunity he wasn&#39;t going to pass it up. “Good you have the submissive tendencies necessary to make for an excellent pair of underwear.”<br />
<br />
Lace cringed at the back handed compliment; as the professor&#39;s nylon coated ass came to rest on his face, pinning his head back onto the chair. Her ass cheeks enveloping his eyes and nose leaving his mouth exposed. “We will conduct the rest of your session like this, consider it exposure therapy.”<br />
<br />
“Is it really okay for you to be doing this?” Lace questioned as he instinctively inhaled her musk. His nostrils were bombarded by the professor&#39;s scent, a mixture of soap, sweat, and sex that despite on some level feeling incredibly wrong it instantly gave him a raging erection. Lace&#39;s hand moved towards his crotch before being stopped by the sharp pain of Prof Winters heel. “It will be fine as long as you understand there&#39;s nothing sexual about it; you are simply providing me with a seat. Just as when you are worn it&#39;s not for your sexual pleasure but rather to fill a role in your owner&#39;s wardrobe. Remember as panties you won&#39;t be able to cum.”<br />
<br />
“You say that but you&#39;re the one grinding your pussy in my f-” *pffffft* Lace immediately began coughing and violently thrashing as Prof Winter&#39;s fart forced its way up into his airways. The stench was bad but for some reason that wasn&#39;t the worst part; it just felt indescribably wrong. Just like the scent of her musk or the feeling of her ass pressing down on him Lace knew on a fundamental level she was not the same as Ash. Even if his mind couldn&#39;t remember it exactly, his body knew it.<br />
<br />
The professor held her composure as she pressed her ass harder into the thrashing students face as he cried and begged her to remove herself. She did not apologize or excuse herself. Why would she? She had very quickly stopped viewing Lace as a man but rather saw him for what he was: a confused pair of panties. If anything she felt she should send an apology to Ash for using him without her permission. She checked her watch; they had forty-five minutes left in their session, plenty of time for her to have her fun with the sniveling little undergarment.<br />
<br />
Lace did eventually calm down from the first fart and did his best to respond to her questions. She asked about all kinds of things from whether or not he was happy with the style of panties he became, to asking for details on all his R.T.F.S symptoms. All the while she would let out the occasional fart but never acknowledging them; just forcing poor little lace to power through them.<br />
<br />
Eventually the topic turned towards his family. “And have you spoken to your family about any of this yet?” She asked as she forced him to huff yet another of her farts.<br />
<br />
“y-yes.” Lace choked out as his eyes burned with tears. “They were told once I was turned back. They filed the missing persons report after all.”<br />
<br />
“And? how have they taken it?” She asked as she made more notes. Her little movements constantly grinding her rear into Lace&#39;s face. “My mom wasn&#39;t surprised.”<br />
<br />
“oh?” she asked curiously. “No, she almost seemed to have been expecting it. She said I was just like my father.”<br />
<br />
“Is your father also a human object then?” Lace cringed as he felt the professor&#39;s anus twitch slightly when she asked that. He&#39;d learned pretty quickly that meant another fart was coming soon. “Yeah, I didn&#39;t know until after I turned back though. I hadn&#39;t seen him si-” *pffffft* “cough, cough. Si-since I was eight but after he and my mom got divorced my mom decided to turn him into a sports bra as a gift for her new girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
“And why&#39;d she do that?” Lace struggled to maintain composure between the stench of her farts and having to recount how his dad ended up living in his stepmother&#39;s underwear drawer. “Apparently it was his fantasy… but my mom wasn&#39;t into it, a woman from her yoga class however was. The two of them hit it off and she agreed to give him to her. At first it was only an occasional thing but once his skin started turning to pink spandex they decided he wasn&#39;t allowed in human form around us.”<br />
<br />
“And why was that?” Lace started to choke up. “He didn&#39;t want any of his kids to get any weird ideas from him. So he decided it would be better if we never saw him again.”<br />
<br />
“I see that must have been hard on you but it isn&#39;t all that surprising there is some evidence for a genetic link for these things. You mentioned siblings, how have they responded?” Lace was grateful that she changed the subject even if it was to something arguably worse. “There&#39;s eight of us in total, me and one of my brothers and three of my sisters are quintuplets, there&#39;s also one older sister and two younger half siblings.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s a lot, how&#39;d your mother do it?.” Professor Winters was genuinely taken aback by the size of Lace&#39;s family. “Yeah in vitro, dad came from money and both my mother and stepmother have high paying jobs. Anyway it&#39;s been a mix of teasing and apathy out of them. Both my twin brother and older sister told me if I had wanted to be underwear they&#39;d have taken me in.”<br />
<br />
“Your twin brother? Are you even okay with being a boy&#39;s underwear?” Lace felt a little disgusted even more so than he already was suffering under this woman&#39;s ass. “Of course not, I&#39;m straight even if he is a femboy it doesn&#39;t matter, besides the idea of being worn by any of my siblings makes my skin crawl.”<br />
<br />
“I understand that but as we covered this isn&#39;t about sexuality. Underwear doesn&#39;t get to decide who or what genitals wear them.” As she was speaking she once again checked her watch only to notice they were a few minutes over time. She shrugged before pushing out one final fart directly up her victim&#39;s nose. *pffffttthhhh* “And with that Mr. Lacey our time is up.”<br />
<br />
Finally Lace was free as the sadistic woman&#39;s ass lifted up. Immediately Lace sputtered and gasped for air as the last of her farts burned its way through his system. Looking up Lace saw that tiny red thong and on some level felt a certain kinship with it. The two of them had been through a lot this past hour. <br />
<br />
Before he could leave the professor handed him two envelopes. One for him and one for Ash. His contained a detailed psychological profile of him as well as custodial paperwork for if he wanted to give himself fully to Ash. He wasn&#39;t sure what hers had and was too exhausted to bother peeking inside. He needed to get home and wash this woman&#39;s stink off of him.<br />
<br />
Instinctively Lace heads to</p>
