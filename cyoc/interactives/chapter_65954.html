<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somewhere a cock could be heard crowing and blinking, he looked at the curtains covering the window, wondering where he was. Shifting, realising that he was lying partly on his side, partly on his stomach, he became aware that something was off and rolling over, he threw back the covers and upon seeing his body, he swore and then sputtered out, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as he stared down at what was clearly a girl's body.<br />
<br />
Touching the milky white breasts, realising that they were indeed very much real, he pulled his hands away and then after a moment, ran a hand down his abdomen, tracing the flat skin until he paused for a moment over the mons pubis and then pushed his hand between his legs.<br />
<br />
Only to draw it back when he clearly felt the exterior female genitalia and swearing yet again, he looked about and spying a mirror affixed to a wall, he leapt out of the bed, stumbled a bit as his feet hit the floor and rushing to the reflective object, he peered in, taking in the fact that he was clearly female from the neck down, though his feet and hands did look kind of big for a girl, and that everything from the neck up was clearly male.<br />
<br />
Confused, he turned about in place, looking at his body from different angles, noting that except for the hair on his head and his eyebrows, he did not have any other hair on his body. Sitting down on the bed, he hugged his legs close to his body, noting on smooth they were when he looped his arms around them, and asking himself, &quot;Who am I? And how did I get here? And where is here? And why do I look like a girl, but know that I am male?&quot; and losing himself in thought, he stared off into space, listening to the sounds of what was clearly people somewhere outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are awake,&quot; a voice announced, drawing him out of his thoughts and looking in the direction of the speaking, he saw a woman with raven-black hair and tan skin standing in a doorway peering at him.<br />
<br />
Feeling suddenly modest, he pulled the covers over his body and asked, &quot;Where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling in a friendly manner, the woman stepped through the doorway and pulled shut the door as she explained, &quot;You are the camp of the Kitsune. Think of it like a gypsy band living in modern day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how to take this, he watched as the woman went to a chest and began taking out various clothes, commenting, &quot;You look like you might fit in my sister's clothes,&quot; and tossing several articles toward him, she asked, &quot;Would you care for breakfast? I can explain as much as I know and answer any question you might have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing at the clothes, he looked back at the woman and instead of reaching for them, he asked, &quot;Would you think less of me if I told you I was a guy and not a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman laughs in a good nature way and then replies, &quot;Honey. Here, that won't matter. We have several people who used to be guys and were turned in girls, and vice-versa. Some choose to do so. Others are the end results of not fully understanding what they got themselves into.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something clicks inside his mind and asking, &quot;What happened to the body suit I was wearing?&quot; unsure of why a body suit was important, but knowing it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are still wearing it,&quot; the woman told him. &quot;Though it has reverted to its human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blinking, he was about to ask another question, when the woman held up a hand and told him, &quot;Get dressed and come have some breakfast. I'll try to explain as much as I can then. Maybe it might help you remember a thing or two. Like your name, where you came from and where you bought the costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing at the clothes, noting that there would be no doubt how he appeared from the neck down, he glanced back at the woman and explained, &quot;I cannot were these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still smiling, the woman asked, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling uncomfortable and sure that he was being silly, he commented, &quot;Well, you see, they're girl's clothes. And I'm a guy. People will think I am some sort of pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing again in a good nature way, the woman told him, &quot;Honey. When people look at you, they are going to see a girl. Even if you still have a guy's hands, feet and head. They will not think anything of you, except those outside the camp might think that you went through a tomboy phase when you were young and still retained some of those features. As for being a guy, well I have some questions that might clear up that bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot,&quot; he replied as he reached for a button-up blouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's try for something simple,&quot; the woman replied and still smiling, she began to slowly ask one question after another, starting off easy and moving into more difficult areas that only a girl would know and understand, to which he answered most questions with ease.<br />
<br />
Slightly disturbed that he had been able to answer questions only a girl would be able to understand, he was about to ask how this was possible but was stopped as the woman told him, &quot;Get dressed while I get your breakfast,&quot; and reaching for a button-up blouse, he watched her leave, wondering who he really was and how it was that he arrived at wherever it was that he was.<br />
----<br />
<br />
When the woman returned with breakfast, he had finally settled on wearing a button-up blouse and simple multi-tiered floor-length dress, he accepted the meal with a thank you and as he started to eat, the woman explained what she knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are the Kitsune,&quot; she began. &quot;We, at one time, were loyal messengers to the Kami Inari. When Inari was no longer worshipped, his power waned and eventually was lost. When that happened, we stopped being his messengers and Inari faded. Some say he found his way to another universe where he made a pact with Isis so that they could rule, but nobody really knows the truth behind that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What we do know is that we could and could not continue our species without Inari's power. If we mated amongst each other, or with mortals, what we got was ordinary humans, or the case of procreating in our fox form, simple everyday common foxes. Realising that there was no way we could continue on, we used our magick to create the costumes. These costumes, would be sent out into the world to select costume shops, where they could be purchased by immortals that felt drawn to them, whether the mortal realised it or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shortly after we had sent out the costumes, we noticed some flaws. Such as in your case. A person could put on the body suit, without the mask or hands and feet, and still feel the call of the first transformation if they went outside. From there, they would undergo the first transformation, because of the body suit mind you, and turn into a fox. Unfortunately, they would awaken the next morning without their memories, unable to remember who they were and how to get back to where they bought the costume, should they choose to remove the costume. We intervened and brought those who bought the body suit to out camps and tried to help them, knowing that there could be a very could chance that they would be forever stuck they way they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do I change back?&quot; he asked as he finished his breakfast.<br />
<br />
Smiling sadly, the woman told him, &quot;That will be a difficult decision. As you have undergone your first transformation, without the rest of the costume, you must now find a way back to your own world, if removing the costume is what you really want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if I choose to stay?&quot; he asked. &quot;What then. Will I be forever stuck with the hands, feet and head of a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, the woman explained, &quot;There are options. One being that we can give you the rest of the costume and let the rest of the transformation to female Kitsune take. Or, and there is no real guarantee that this will work, we could give you the male Kitsune costume and let you try that on.&quot; and seeing that he was about to ask something, the woman added, &quot;But you must understand that because you were drawn to the female Kitsune, you wore the body suit, and you underwent your first transformation, there is a very slim chance of the male Kitsune costume excepting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he listened to this, he glanced down at the empty plate, thinking over what he just been told. As he sat in silence, the woman continued to explain more of the Kitsune race and its impact on the world of mortals, finishing up with some of the myths the mortals believed and telling him, &quot;You do not have to decide what you are going to do right now. There is a period before changing back becomes impossible. I do believe that it is a three month period. So, there is some hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, feeling suddenly really depressed, he thanked the woman and handed back the tray with the dishes on it, barely listening as the woman said, &quot;By the way. My name is Alexis. When you want, I will show you around the camp and for the moment, you can share mine and my sister's wagon until you get one of your own. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another nod and he listened as the woman left, leaving him alone with his thoughts. Running a hand over the soft fabric of the dress, liking the way it brushed against his legs and the way it pressed into his privates, he wondered what he should do and how he was to get back to wherever it was that he came from, finally deciding that his first course of action would be to try and remember his name. &quot;And if that fails,&quot; he thought ruefully, &quot;I'll just have to come up with a different name.&quot;</p>
