<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And so as I felt my vocal chords produce the words I couldn&#39;t control, I was only left to hope the coin toss of gender was in my favor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I temporarily assumed the life of Alice Poincare, a Canadian teen, and stayed as her until I gain a real and deep appreciation of what being her is like.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Fuck.</i> I thought. <i>Her? Alice? Isn&#39;t... Isn&#39;t Alice a girl&#39;s name?</i><br />
<br />
So there I was. It was happening. I was to loose my johnson. But what worried me even more was the girl part, as well as the super-vague condition on me returning to my own life. What does it even mean to &quot;gain a real and deep appreciation&quot; of someone&#39;s else life? And who will judge if I did? Magic I guessed. But I didn&#39;t get to ponder on that one for much longer because I felt my mouth move again, propelled to move on it&#39;s own accord by the magic of my foolish wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I kept my own memories and could sometimes access some of Alice&#39;s, but only when absolutely necessary to avoid being diagnosed with amnesia. I wish I kept my own mind, but I gain those of Alice&#39;s feelings and thought patterns I mention in a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The good part was that I was keeping my own mind. The bad part was that the last few words of the wish made me think that my mind will be messed with a bunch to have it match some teen chick in some way. The though of that was terrifying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Alice had problems with her body image. In the past she was teased because of her height, which made her really conscious about her size. She&#39;s particularly self-conscious about how small her feet are, even relative to her petite frame, even though nobody ever picked on her feet. I wish Alice was into gymnastics, having spent the last few years as the captain of her female gymnastics group. She always admired strong-built, lean women who could perform well in many athletic feats, but Mother Nature decided that future wasn&#39;t for her, as soon as puberty hit. I wish that while her torso and limbs remained as slim and slender as ever, in the past year her pelvis expanded considerably giving her wide, bony hips spotted with an occasional stretch mark due to how quickly they grew. But the real trouble came with her chest, which she learned to hate. I wish at the point when I assume her life, Alice was about to make the decision to leave competitive gymnastics because of how uncomfortable her breasts make the physical training. I wish that even though not excessively massive, her breasts were fairly obviously on the larger side for girls her age and no compression sport bra she owns was enough to prevent the painful experience of their excessive movement caused by the amount of jumping around she does in a gym practice. She dresses baggy to hide her chest and is seriously bothered by the fact that people can still tell she even <i>has</i> breasts because of her otherwise small frame. She hates how many sexual connotations there is related to her chest size and feels frustrated by how powerless she is doesn&#39;t have any control over her body advertising her femininity to all the men who seem to leer at her on a daily basis. I wish that Alice could not understand <b>at all</b> the attraction of the soft female curves and as her I will also find it impossible to feel sexually attracted to the female anatomy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Her cousins have been trying to convince her that her breasts are an advantage but she has none of that. In fact, even though her breasts are pretty much perfectly shaped specimen of youthful beauty, she can&#39;t help but find them plainly ugly, obnoxious and embarrassing - projecting too far, being squashed too close together and yet spilling into the sides too much (because of her small ribcage), with nipples she finds gross because of their size. Finally, I wish she was painfully aware that the constant, deep soreness means her boobs are still actively developing, steadily gaining in volume and heft. She is terrified of how big they might get and how she seems to have absolutely no control over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cold sinking feeling I felt in the bottom of my stomach when I realized I was going to spend some time as a female only grew worse as I heard my own voice make the wish even more drastic. I was about to get a first-hand insight into a life so insanely different from my own... I guess that&#39;s what I had wished for. I had to give the ring that...  But if I knew the outcome the ring was about to produce I doubt I&#39;d have ever signed up for it...<br />
<br />
But I wasn&#39;t able to think about it too much. I felt a little dizzy and before I even realized what was happening I found I was no longer sitting at a bench in a park. I was sat by a table in an unfamiliar kitchen. But that was only the beginning of all the unfamiliar things about my situation...</p>
