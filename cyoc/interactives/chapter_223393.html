<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What&#39;s the difference between a park mascot and a ride mascot?&quot; you asked as you tapped the listing for &#39;shark&#39; near the bottom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that, hang on.&quot; the blonde walked over to a few lockers and cracked one open, pulling out a tannish mass of rubber, &quot;Yeah see rather than working at an attraction they just walk around the park doing all sorts of odd jobs. Helping people out, posing for pictures, attracting new guests, taking tickets that sort of thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So just like wave my arms around and smile when asked to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s more to it than that, but if you wanna boil it down to just that sure. It&#39;s a slow day right now so you&#39;ll probably be doing that anyway so your first shift is gonna be easy.&quot; Ms Hart said as she shook out the mass she was holding. <br />
<br />
It unfurled into a rather large costume. Mainly a tube with long closed off limbs, it had a small fin the middle of it&#39;s back and two big black almost googly eyes on it&#39;s head. The &#39;mouth&#39; of the costume was pretty wide and stretchy, cut out in a &#39;jagged&#39; saw tooth pattern. The &#39;teeth&#39; didn&#39;t feel sharp at all though when it was handed to you. It looked more like a shark themed sleeping bag than a costume. <br />
<br />
Ms Hart gave you a hand in getting into it and thinking about it as a sleeping bag was pretty close. Getting in required you to get your feet into the mouth and pull up, your legs filling in the empty rubber mass and your arms going into the &#39;side fins&#39; that acted like arms for the suit. You needed help pulling it up all the way given your lack of arm mobility now. The shark head was pulled over your own scalp a bit like a hoodie. <br />
<br />
When you were ready Ms Hart brought out a full length mirror. Honestly you looked pretty silly. Like a kid in Shark PJs made out of rubber garbage bags. Your face was peaking out between the shark&#39;s teeth, helping to add to the awkward look as it seemed like you were being eaten. It was pretty comfy though and surprisingly easy to move around in if a bit limited in how far you could move.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s it feel?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad..., could be worse..., is it supposed to be this loose though?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it&#39;s loose, we haven&#39;t hooked up the pump.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pump?&quot; <br />
<br />
She disappeared into a storage closet and rolled out a large metal cylinder with a couple different tubes and attachments to it. Walking back over to you, she patted your leg, around where your hip ended and your thigh started. There was a pretty large nozzle there that you hadn&#39;t noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suit is a one size fits all but we use this to make edits after someone&#39;s in the suit. Easy to just vaccum seal you in rather than making 1 suit that fits maybe three people. Also pumps air in to help kinda fill the suit out for your arms and legs, tail too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t gonna hurt is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a bit but I haven&#39;t heard anyone getting injured.&quot; Hart answered as she attached the hose to you, &quot;Just grit your teeth a bit, I&#39;ve done it and it&#39;s fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before you could voice your agreement or worries; she kicked on the machine which hummed to life with a rumble. The suit started to close around you as you felt the air leave it. The tube like limbs started to shrink down a bit, growing closer to your body and looking more like actual arms and legs now. A bit of weight started to hang on your back, making you look back and see the back fin was inflating, and the tail you hadn&#39;t seen before was unfurling too. The area around your thighs started to grow tight, maybe a little too tight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait a minute...&quot; you started to protest as you raised up your arms to try and get Hart&#39;s attention. <br />
<br />
It was then you noticed how tight the rubber was against your thin dainty limbs. You weren&#39;t much of a gym guy but you knew your arms were bigger than that. And your voice had sounded weird. Not to mention the pressure in your chest...., chest? <br />
<br />
Looking down you realized the suit was ballooning outward around the chest region. In twin recognizable masses. Soon a pair of balloon sized &#39;breasts&#39; were jutting out and they felt... really. Weirdly weird even with the rubber of  the costume. That wasn&#39;t the only change about your body, the tightness around your croctch grew extremly tight until you could almost hear a &#39;pop&#39; as the rubber fully sealed, as if fused to your body now. <br />
<br />
Which if that was true, meant your manhood was missing and a quick check confirmed it. <br />
<br />
You turned to Hart to start giving her a piece of your mind only for some movement at the edge of your vision to catch your attention. The &#39;teeth&#39; of the suit were wiggling as air filled each one which made them start to stand straight. The problem was this was causing the &#39;mouth&#39; of the suit to close up over your face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait get me outta...&quot; you cried out as you tried to move only to stumble and fall to the ground. <br />
<br />
The pump didn&#39;t stop, nor did the teeth as they closed with a wet rubbery snap and then grew closer, tighter to you. You heard several more wet rubber snaps as it felt like your body was being shifted into place within the suit rather than the suit fitting you. Your mouth widended and grew out, your butt expanded and legs became more shapely. Throughout it all you could breath, even though it felt like some of the rubber was forcing itself into your throat. The darkness eventually was replaced with a bright light and you blinked a few times. <br />
<br />
You found yourself still in the break area with Hart offering a hand up. You took it, wondering if you had just passed out but then you noticed your hand, that dainty hand. Before you could fully freak out, Hart got you to your feet and stood you in front of the mirror again. <br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t you anymore. No longer looking like a dingus in a shark tube suit, you looked like a tall anthro tanned shark woman. A short snout replaced your nose and black eyes stared out from behind some bright red bangs, the tips fading a bit into white. Your hair was pretty long and wavy, reminding you a bit of how mermaids had their hair always flowing in the water. <br />
<br />
Your arms were thinner with a fin sitting on the forearm on each. You used these to fill up the breast that were on your chest now, which felt pretty real and very light. A fin was in the middle of your back too, a bit bigger than the others. Your hips were wider but smaller, more toned than the half cared for body you had before. A tail absentmindedly whipped around your backside.  <br />
<br />
The oddest thing was, you weren&#39;t an &#39;animal&#39;...., you were a toy. <br />
<br />
Seems ran down your body, mainly down the sides of your figure and limbs and where they would start or stop. So more seems around the shoulders, upper thighs, and wrists. That nozzle was still on your leg, with the hose still attached to it. To top it all off, it looked like you had handle bars right where your tail met your ass.  And while you were naked, you lacked the additional sexual traits, like nipples and equipment down there. <br />
<br />
Turning into an infltabile anthro pool toy wasn&#39;t in the job description but.... <br />
<br />
You felt pretty good, and you didn&#39;t feel like freaking out now. If anything you felt pretty good. You didn&#39;t feel sore or anything, felt pretty light on your feet; heck you kinda enjoyed the feeling. <br />
<br />
&quot;So.... how do you like your suit?&quot; Hart asked, putting a hand on your shoulder</p>
