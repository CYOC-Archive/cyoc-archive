<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will knew that something magical or high tech must’ve been involved in turning Chuck into a lower body. For all he knew, Chuck’s upper body was somewhere else in the house. For these reasons, he scoured the house.<br />
<br />
Chuck was all zipped up in the young man’s backpack. He knew struggling was useless at this point, and he had no need to breathe, so he took a nap.<br />
<br />
Will looked for anything suspicious in the house. Finally he saw an open laptop with a brand he didn’t recognize, ‘Chronivac’. His eyes scanned the screen and it wasn’t hard to make heads and tails of the situation. Clearly Mandy and Chuck had used this to transform Chuck for their married enjoyment. Now Will was gonna take Chuck home for his own enjoyment...<br />
<br />
Will packed up the laptop in a plastic bag since his backpack was already so full. He stashed his bike in some thick bushes so that Mandy wouldn’t know who had been here and headed home.<br />
<br />
Once home, Will hid the chronivac and opened up his backpack taking the hefty muscular lower body out onto his bed. He put blankets over Chuck to hide him from the rest of his family.<br />
<br />
“Alright Chuck,” said Will, “as much as I wanna play with you now, I have plans to go meet with my friends. If you stay still there, nobody should see you.”<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?! He knows that I’m Chuck but he still wants to keep me as a sex toy??” Thought Chuck. His dick twitched in his tighty whities though.<br />
<br />
Will headed out. Chuck was on the bed for an hour before boredom broke him. He started shaking his foot simply to have something to do.<br />
<br />
The noise from Chuck shaking his foot attracted Will’s dad, Kevin, who heard the noise yet knew that he was supposed to be alone currently in the house. Kevin was a muscular short man with a body absolutely coated in black body hair. His beard and mustache were overgrown as santa claus, and he had a beer belly which fit the santa look too. Chuck heard the man approach and stopped moving his foot, but it was too late..<br />
<br />
“What the...” said Kevin, who saw the blanket just stop moving. He ripped the blanket off and was stunned to see Chuck’s lower body. Chuck could see Kevin through the briefs and was surprised that the hairy man was completely nude. Chuck looked away from Kevin’s penis before he remembered that there was no way for people to see which direction he was looking. He resumed gawking at Kevin’s penis. It was quite a sight, a big hunky hairy man with a measly three inch pecker.<br />
<br />
“Why am I looking at his penis?” Chuck asked himself. “Besides, I know people have said that Will’s dad is a homophobe. It’s not like he’d do anything to me.”<br />
<br />
“That boy got a sex doll? And the faggot got a male one at that,” said Kevin in wonder, his hand haphazardly ruffling Chuck’s junk in the tighty whities. Chucked moaned, not that anyone but himself heard. His dick grew a bit hard despite trying to remind himself that he’s straight.<br />
<br />
“Damn, this thing is way too realistic,” said Kevin feeling the penis and balls through the fabric. He looked around, making sure that nobody could see him and lowered Chuck’s briefs.<br />
<br />
Chuck watched as Kevin grew hard from seeing his genitals. Kevin looked conflicted, like he hated that seeing this ‘sex doll’s’ male parts was arousing him. Chuck knew the feeling as he still couldn’t stop staring at the gorilla of a man before him, including the intimate bits.<br />
<br />
“Well, it is just a sex doll...and it does still have a hole...” Kevin did the mental math on whether or not it would be ‘gay’ to fuck this extremely realistic man’s lower half.<br />
<br />
Kevin grabbed the lube from Will’s nightstand and stripped Chuck of his only article of clothing. <br />
<br />
Chuck could’ve done something. He could’ve kicked in every direction or tried to get off the bed and make a run for it. He told himself that it was because he didn’t want to ‘out’ himself as being a transformed man, but the truth was, the closer he got to a man fucking him, the more curious it had made him.<br />
<br />
Kevin lubed Chuck’s hole. The lube was cold, which was a shock to Chuck’s system, but the furry man’s beefy fingers worked his hole nice and warm. The sensation was so nice it made Chuck let go in a way and he felt his anus relax and start opening. Then, Chuck felt something hard and smooth against his virgin straight man hole he knew it was Kevin’s little penis, which had now boned up to four and a half inches, but the feeling was completely knew. <br />
<br />
Chuck’s hole let its intruder in. Kevin could feel how tight the hole was and assumed that the doll needed time to adjust before he could hump, just like a real person. Having Kevin’s penis inside him made his own penis go from semi hard to fully erect.<br />
<br />
“Gross,” said Kevin, seeing the ‘doll’s’ erection form. But Chuck felt Kevin’s cock twitch inside him while he watched his cock reach it’s full glory of six inches hard. A bead of pre cum was forming on Chuck’s penis. Kevin looked around again and stuck his finger to Chuck’s tip, collecting the pre cum and suckling his finger. Chuck could’ve nutted just from witnessing this. A straight man thinking he’s completely alone and exploring his secret curiosity for men’s bodies. It wasn’t completely different to the position he was in.<br />
<br />
Kevin felt Chuck’s hole loosen up a bit and he started hammering Chuck’s man pussy.  Chuck moaned inaudibly as he felt the hairy gorilla man’s balls slap his taint while the little pecker worked on his prostate. He couldn’t believe he thought Kevin’s penis was small. Apparently a cock that size was (i)plenty(i) for a virgin ass.<br />
<br />
Chuck could feel himself becoming Kevin’s bitch. For the first time since being captured he thought, “I could live like this forever.” He was probably gonna cum hands free from from being fucked but surprisingly Kevin started to jerk Chuck’s cock for him. It felt amazing to have such a thick calloused hand on his penis. Both men came hard, Chucks toes spreading in every direction while his legs spasmed outward in orgasm.</p>
