<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After ringing the door, she heard a voice from inside say &quot;I&#39;ll get it!&quot; and the door was opened to reveal a girl that Elena mistook for Bethany at first- the older Bethany that is.  Rachel looked a great deal like her sister- tall, athletic, tan, with long legs, sandy blonde hair, and blue eyes (not to mention a nice pair of C-cup breasts!), and Elena&#39;s wish had apparently made her 17 again and a Senior in High School.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elena?&quot;  Rachel blinked.  &quot;What brings you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I saw Bethany&#39;s accident, and I wanted to see if she was alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel gave Elena an odd look.  &quot;No offense, but last I checked, you two weren&#39;t exactly friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena nodded.  &quot;I know, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my stupid kid sister is fine, save for a few bruises.  My car, on the other hand, needs some front end work.  So she&#39;s not going to be getting any visitors anytime soon.&quot;  Rachel shook her head.  &quot;Honestly, I have no idea what got into her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there was one other thing...I was going to see if your parents would be willing to hire a tutor.  I know Bethany&#39;s grades aren&#39;t great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel practically pulled her inside and closed the door.  &quot;Ok, out with it.  Is this some kind of plan to get revenge?  I know Bethany is a brat and deserves it, but she doesn&#39;t need help getting in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena shook her head.  &quot;I mean it.  I wasn&#39;t planning on charging much, but I could use a little money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems sus, Elena.  Don&#39;t you and Chris get good money from Sahar&#39;s Dad for her room and board?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris does, yes.  But I can&#39;t get a job yet, and I want to start saving.  It would be nice to have a car once I can get my permit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel seemed to consider this.  &quot;Ok, I&#39;m sorry I gave you the third degree.  I&#39;m sure Mom and Dad would be happy to get her some help.  It just took me off guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena noted that Rachel was a lot nicer than Bethany had been at her age.  She regretted not knowing her before now.  &quot;Yeah, well, she might still scream bloody murder when she sees me.  But I never had anything against Bethany, and I thought maybe this would be a good chance to bury the hatchet as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you luck with that!&quot;  Rachel chuckled.  &quot;Come on, Mom is in the kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena was surprised that Mrs. Wyatt actually cooked meals for her family.  She&#39;d figured, with as much money as they had, she would hire someone for the task.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mom, you won&#39;t guess who just showed up.&quot;  Rachel said.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wyatt turned and smiled.  &quot;Why, Elena Bishop, this is a surprise!&quot;  Elena noted that the woman looked a bit younger than the last time she&#39;d seen her- another side effect of her wish, she supposed.  She also resembled her daughters, save her hair was blonde.  &quot;What brings you by?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena explained her offer and Mrs. Wyatt considered it.  &quot;You know, it&#39;s not a bad idea.  I know what a great student you are.  Though I thought you and Bethany didn&#39;t like each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I said!&quot;  Rachel chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, to be honest, no, we haven&#39;t.  But I really hope we can put that behind us, I don&#39;t have any real problems with Bethany as a person, so I&#39;m not sure how all this started.  Maybe I did something without meaning to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I rather doubt that, you&#39;ve always struck me as a well-mannered young lady.  Well let&#39;s talk money.  How does 20 dollars an hour sound?  Plus you can eat dinner with us if you want, I never mind an extra guest at the dinner table.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That would be fine, Mrs. Wyatt- at least, if Bethany agrees.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, call me Carol.  I know I&#39;m not getting any younger, but &#39;Mrs. Wyatt&#39; sounds like an old lady.&quot;  Carol smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus she&#39;d better agree if she knows what&#39;s good for her.  I still want to put her over my knee and spank her for taking my car out for a joyride.&quot;  Rachel grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your Father feels much the same.  Maybe we&#39;ve been too easy on her.  I want to chalk it up to teenaged hormones- I remember what you were like at her age, Rachel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, I never stole a car!&quot;  Rachel protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but what about that slumber party back when you were in the 8th grade?&quot;  Carol smiled slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot;  Rachel blushed.  &quot;We don&#39;t have to talk about that now.  Come on, Elena, I&#39;ll show you to Sis&#39;s room.&quot;  She quickly dragged Elena away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slumber party?&quot;  She asked, when they were out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, so embarrassing.  Fine, I&#39;ll tell you, but not a word of this to anyone, or I&#39;ll drown you in the river.&quot;  Rachel glared at Elena.<br />
<br />
Elena held up her hands.  &quot;I won&#39;t, I swear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better not.  Well, I decided it would be a good idea for me and my friends to try alcohol, so I swiped some of Dad&#39;s rum, and made rum and cokes.  We got wasted, and, uh, someone had the bright idea to have a kissing contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot;  Elena&#39;s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t remember much, but when Mom checked on me in the morning, I was naked in bed spooning with Katrina Franklin!  I wanted to die, let me tell you.&quot;  Rachel shook her head.  &quot;Stay away from alcohol, Elena, it&#39;s bad news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, it wasn&#39;t that bad, I mean, Katrina is a sweet girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the point!&quot;  Rachel snapped. then sighed.  &quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to snap on you.  Her Mom hit the roof, saying I was trying to turn her daughter into a lesbian or something.  You know how Mrs. Franklin is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, super religious.&quot;  Elena shook her head.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, at the time, I was worried about what other people would think.  Seems silly now, but you know how the rumor mill is at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I get a lot of shit because I don&#39;t have a boyfriend.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but hey, fuck them, right?  We&#39;re going to be graduating next year, you know?  And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a scholarship, as smart as you are.  So it&#39;s time to stop worrying about kid stuff.&quot;  Rachel gave Elena a soft smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right.  Do you ever wonder...you know...if things were different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean me and Kat hooking up?  High school lesbians?&quot;  Rachel looked both ways.  &quot;Just between us, yes.  I mean, I don&#39;t know if she&#39;d feel the same way, what with her family, but...eh.  What, are you surprised?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little, I mean you have a boyfriend.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jake?  Yeah but...it&#39;s not going to last.  It&#39;s totally physical between us.  The sex is good...but...I want more from a relationship than he can give.  Oh but listen to me, you&#39;re still a virgin, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena felt like she was blushing down to her toes, and didn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.&quot;  Rachel put her hand on Elena&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;You got stuck in a rough spot.  Too smart and mature for the kids your age, and too young for anyone at school.  But when the time comes, feel free to come talk to me.  I wish I&#39;d had someone who wasn&#39;t an adult to go to when I was your age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Rachel.&quot;  She smiled, and Rachel smiled back.  Then she lead Elena upstairs and knocked on a door.  &quot;Yo, Bethie!  Warden says you can have a visitor!&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened.  Bethany looked like she&#39;d been crying, and her hair was mussed.  &quot;Who is it, Ray...oh.&quot;  Her eyes got wide when she saw Elena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Bethany.  Could we talk for a minute?&quot;  Elena asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...uh...sure, ok.&quot;  Bethany stepped back from the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t have too much fun, kids.  Dinner will be in an hour!&quot;  Rachel waved and walked off.  Elena had to force herself not to follow the sway of the older girl&#39;s behind (she was wearing very short shorts, which she filled out quite nicely).<br />
<br />
Once inside Bethany&#39;s room, the other girl closed the door.  &quot;Why are you here?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I saw your accident, and I wanted to check if you were ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...yeah.  Bruises mostly.  I&#39;m probably grounded until I&#39;m 18 though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Bethany, I know we haven&#39;t gotten along before.  I don&#39;t know how it got started, but I&#39;d really like it to stop.  I know I&#39;m weird and smart, and not popular, so it&#39;s not like I expect to hang out or anything- but I&#39;m hoping we can at least be friendly, if not friends.&quot;  Elena started.<br />
<br />
Bethany gave her a strange look before going to sit on her bed.  She gestured to her computer chair.  &quot;Have a seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it has to be hard to believe.  But it&#39;s true.  And more than that, I know you have trouble with school, so I&#39;d like to tutor you, if that&#39;s ok.&quot;  She ventured a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Bethany paused.  &quot;I&#39;d like that.  But I thought you hated me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you tell me why you think that?  If I&#39;m screwing up, I want to get better.  I&#39;m tired of being an outcast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  Do you remember when we first met?  I tried to talk to you, and you just blew me off.&quot;  Bethany started.<br />
<br />
&#39;Is that what happened?  Shit...what did happen..?&#39;  Elena thought hard.  &quot;They&#39;d bumped me to the 7th grade, and you were in the 6th...you were there with Mandy Carter, Jennifer Drew, and...oh God, Courtney Lemont.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I said hi to you, and you just ignored me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t you.  It was the girls you were with.&quot;  Elena sighed.  &quot;Courtney was always bullying me, and I thought you were just another one of her Cronies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, they did call us that.  Courtney&#39;s Cronies!  I&#39;d forgotten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  And she had such a bad attitude, we called her Courtney Lemon.  So...I guess it was my fault for assuming you were like them.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I guess I deserved it.  Because Courtney told me you were  a stuck up bitch, and...when she bullied you, I joined in.  Because I wanted to fit in.  Rachel always made friends super easy, but I always felt she was smarter and prettier than I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elena gave her a look.  &quot;Maybe smarter, but prettier?  You look like her clone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bethany giggled.  &quot;Yeah, I know, but everyone would always praise her.  Oh Rachel, you&#39;re so pretty!  Oh Rachel, I love your hair!  Oh Rachel, where did you get that jacket?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it&#39;s normal to be jealous of your siblings.  I mean, I love Chris with all my heart, but I always wanted to be tall like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, Chris is gorgeous!  If she ever wore a dress or makeup, we&#39;d all look like hags!&quot;  Bethany gushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even with all those muscles?&quot;  Elena grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?  She has lady abs!  Who wouldn&#39;t want those?  I&#39;m always struggling to keep the pounds off.&quot;  Bethany frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  You look healthy to me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, it&#39;s hard work.  I don&#39;t know how Sis makes it look so easy.  I look at a pizza and I gain five pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s rough.  I&#39;ve always been skinny.  Dad was always trying to feed me.&quot;  She felt sad, remembering her Father.<br />
<br />
&quot;You miss him, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much.&quot;  Elena nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  For everything.  Can we start over, do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that, Bethany.  A lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bethany smiled then, and Elena wondered if she&#39;d ever seen Bethany&#39;s real smile before.  Sure, she&#39;d seen Bethany smile, but it was usually fake, with malicious intent.  &#39;Holy shit, she&#39;s cute!&#39;, Elena thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you say something?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...did I say the quiet part out loud?&quot;  Elena blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure, you mumbled something.&quot;  Bethany gave her a suspicious look.<br />
<br />
Not sure what else to say, Elena came out and told her the truth.  &quot;I just realized how cute you are when you smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
That brought the smile back full force.  &quot;You think I&#39;m cute?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you&#39;re cute!  Rachel may be smart and sexy, but she&#39;s nowhere near as cute as you.&quot;  Elena smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;...thank you.&quot;  Now Bethany was blushing, her voice soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re quite welcome.  Well we have some time, what are you having problems with?&quot;  She leaned forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh um...&quot; Bethany&#39;s brain almost audibly changed gears, and she started talking about school.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
