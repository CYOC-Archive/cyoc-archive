<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rodrick lay on top of the heap of Don Grimaldi&#39;s clothes.  He couldn&#39;t believe this was what his life had come to.  He was a pair of underwear trapped in his gym teacher&#39;s house, after being worn by said gym teacher for several hours.  Now Mr. Grimaldi was taking a shower, leaving Rodrick alone on the floor of the bathroom.  At least he&#39;d been able to see things through Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s eyes and not have to endure several hours being stuffed between his pants and his junk.  He&#39;d even got to learn a few things about his gym teacher.<br />
<br />
A tingling enveloped Rodrick&#39;s cloth body.  Soon, he felt himself begin to grow.  Rodrick&#39;s nonexistent heart leaped.  Could it be?  As his underwear body grew, cloth began to extrude out of the three openings.  The cloth forming out of the leg holes began taking the shape of legs, as the rest was slowly taking the form of a torso.  Finally!  Now he could get out of here!  Arms grew out of his cloth torso, as well as the beginnings of a head.  The cloth began turning pink and fleshy, and the finer details of his face took shape.  His organ manifested, as well as his muscles.  He was able to make himself move again!  The cloth over his mouth formed into fleshy lips and split apart.  He took a deep breath for the first time in hours.  It felt good to breath.<br />
<br />
Rodrick sat up, still on top of Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s clothes.  He examined his fingers, flexing each of them experimentally.  He looked down his arms.  Everything seemed to be in order.  Well, mostly.  Maybe it was because he&#39;d been underwear for too long, but it seemed there was more hair on his arms than he remembered.  But the point was he was human again!  And that gold banded underwear was nowhere in sight.  Rodrick sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
Mr. Grimaldi stopped humming.  Rodrick held his breath.  The only sound was the water streaming from the shower.  After a tense moment, the gym teacher started to hum tunelessly once again.<br />
<br />
Rodrick carefully stood up, his body feeling heavier after his time as an undergarment.  He had to get out of there as quickly as possible.  He tried recalling the route Mr. Grimaldi had taken to get to his house.  Rodrick wasn&#39;t far from his home.  He could probably walk there.  But he was stark naked.  He couldn&#39;t go out there like this.  He wiggled his toes, feeling Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s shirt and gym shorts underneath him.  The thought of wearing his fat, sweaty teacher&#39;s clothes was not appealing to him, but it certainly beat being underwear.<br />
<br />
As quietly as he could, Rodrick began slipping on Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s much too large clothes.  He had to pull the drawstring on the shorts a fair way to make sure that wouldn&#39;t fall off of him.  As he did so, Rodrick noticed something very odd.  He made sure that his body was kept hairless for the ladies.  His body was naturally smooth, and he shared what little body hair he did have.  But now he was sporting a covering of hair upon his chest and running down his stomach.  It was dark, too, unlike his normal blonde-red coloring.  As he looked at his torso, Rodrick could see his form looked softer and rounder than before.  He cupped his stomach, feeling a small gut, his abs completely gone.  He experimentally jiggled it, watching in horror as his pecs wiggled as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Grimaldi had stopped humming once again.  &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck it.  Rodrick opened the door and slipped out before Mr. Grimaldi could open the curtain and get a look at him.  He slipped on the large polo shirt and, as quickly and quietly as he could, made his way out of the house.  As he passed through the kitchen on his way to the front door, he almost ran straight into Molly, Mr. Grimadi&#39;s daughter, who had gotten out of bed to get a drink of water.  She stared up at him with large, confused eyes.<br />
<br />
Shit.  Rodrick slipped past her and run out into the darkening evening.  He had no shoes or socks on, so ran in his bare feet for a block and a half, still shirtless.  His new gut bounced and jiggled the whole way.  The whole reason he didn&#39;t run farther was he got winded fairly quickly.  As he stopped for breath he slipped on the large shirt, covering the new flab and hair.  &quot;What the fuck is happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After a bit of a walk, made longer by his lack of footwear, Rodrick arrived at his own house.  His parents weren&#39;t even home yet.  They probably had no idea he&#39;d been gone.  Typical.  He collapsed on the couch in relief.  At last his ordeal was over.  But he wasn&#39;t without battle scars.  He felt the lump of flab on his stomach as he laid face-down on the cushions.  He sighed, sitting back up.  He had to inspect the damage.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Rodrick stood shirtless in front of a full-length mirror.  His finely crafted abs were gone, covered by a small, round gut, the kind you saw on out-of-season college students.  On top of that, his torso had a decent covering of hair.  He was by no means as hairy as Mr. Grimaldi, but it was certainly more than he had before.  At least his back was still smooth.  It seemed to be confined to his chest, stomach, arms, and legs.  Rodrick examined his face as well, groaning as he found changes there, too.  His face was still his own, but it seemed to be subtly rounder, the flesh under his chin sagging just the smallest bit.  The stubble he left to decorate his chin seemed denser and darker, giving him a look he wasn&#39;t going for.  Even the hair on his scalp had darkened, becoming a dark blonde, almost brown.  He even spotted thick stubble adorning the skin above his upper lip, the beginnings of a mustache.  And, perhaps it was just him, but he thought he looked older, too.  Less a high school senior, more a man in his twenties.  <br />
<br />
The whole thing was so strange.  It was as if he&#39;d brought back a bit of Mr. Grimaldi with him.  He didn&#39;t want this.  He didn&#39;t want this at all!  Maybe it would wear off?  Even if it didn&#39;t, he could still fix this.<br />
<br />
Curious, Rodrick decided to weight himself.  He winced as he saw he&#39;d, in fact, gained 25 or so pounds after his... incident.  He sighed.  He could work this off, and he could wear some baggy clothes in the meantime. Though, he might have to get some larger pants.  This wasn&#39;t the end of the world.  But somebody needed to pay for this.  Whoever left that pair of underwear in his locker, whoever it had been, would have hell to pay.  He began to make a mental list as he took out his dad&#39;s electric razor and began shaving off his new, unwanted body hair.</p>
