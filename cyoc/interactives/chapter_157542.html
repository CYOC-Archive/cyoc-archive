<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The armies of the great nations, while surprised and alarmed when they finally realized the demon had indeed appeared on Earth and not just some complex farce... were actually rather grimly confident about their odds. After all, humans had bullets, missiles, atomic bombs. What did demons have? Fire breath and pitch forks?<br />
<br />
It never once occurred them that humans weren&#39;t the only ones to advance in the last two-thousand years. That demons have developed means of mass tasty soul harvesting and corruption of their own (as had once said, the justice system in Hell was very straight forward, &#39;bring food, or BE food!&#39;), and had also developed means of long range destruction. One demon had squatted on Pluto as he snipped an American general giving a speech. <br />
<br />
And it also hadn&#39;t occurred to them, that higher dimensional beings, weren&#39;t affected by something confined to limited 3-D reality unless the monsters wanted it to! <br />
<br />
From the spots the gates had opened, the demons had established the auction houses, thought plenty of monsters had taken to claiming any profits for themselves they could get away with, risking being eaten themselves if they were caught gorging themselves on souls meant for processing or auction. <br />
<br />
Surprisingly, many human cities weren&#39;t touched... being nothing more than pantries with cattle allowed to continue their little meaningless lives until it was time to process the cattle, to be made into food, pets, or new monsters, obedient to their sires (until they could usurp them, and lord over the others the exact same way as their predecessors). <br />
<br />
Still, demons being demons, any rule of law was only obeyed as long as fear of punishment outweighed the opportunity.<br />
<br />
A teenage boy was running, a demon playfully followed, nobody tried to help him. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d seen what had happened to what had once been his best friend, and the first thing his best friend had asked after being turned into one of them was, &quot;Do you want me to kill James or eat him?&quot; He asked utterly casually to the monsters in total sincerity. He still had the bite marks to show what had been his friend hadn&#39;t been joking, teasing, or engaging in some high-stakes bluff to fool the monsters. <br />
<br />
The succubus floated behind him, easily able to overtake him, but just following behind at a playful place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sweetie it won&#39;t hurt, for long, okay it&#39;ll really hurt a lot, you&#39;ll scream and scream as I violate you in ways you didn&#39;t think where possible!&quot; <br />
<br />
He dashed between buildings, the succubus just floated THROUGH the walls like they were just holograms to her. <br />
<br />
A pillar of light had appeared at the cross section of buildings ahead of him. There was a little girl, with skin as pale as marble, eyes a solid blue like the sky, hair that was more like gold spun into hair that hair colored gold. On her back were slips of light that huddled to gather were shaped like wings rather than feathers. And above her head a ring of light above her head rather than a floating solid gold ring. She wore the simplest, plain white dress imaginable. <br />
 <br />
She stamped her food and crossed her arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m supposed to raise an army of angels all by myself?! Come on! I know &#39;the multiverse is a big place&#39;! But can&#39;t you spare anybody else!?&quot; The cherub sighed, placing a few fingers to her face. &quot;This is gonna be a loooong assignment.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then spotted James, smiled and waved. &quot;Oh! Hi! Sorry! I&#39;m Hopel! I&#39;m here to recruit and/or draft into Heaven&#39;s army to push back against the forces of evil! Would you care to join? I promise there&#39;s plenty of benefits!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you get lost brat!? I was in the middle of something!&quot; <br />
<br />
Hopel pushed her lips and narrowed her eyes. &quot;Oh. Great. A succubus. Do you have any idea how BORING you are? You have GOT TO BE the most unoriginal demon in existence! You&#39;re also ridiculous! Lust means unrestrained and unfiltered self-centered desire for the immaterial the same way greed is unrestrained and unfiltered self-centered desire for the material! It doesn&#39;t inherently mean primal desire!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pst.&quot; The monster crossed her arms under her comically sized breasts and rolled her eyes. &quot;What does a brat like you know?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My grandma is an angel of procreation you jerk! Ya know, meaningful relationships, meaningful feelings, not mindless short term pleasure that just screws you over in the end. When&#39;s the last time you showed what severing yourself off from the love of everyone else REALLY made your spirit look like?&quot; <br />
<br />
A flash of light. And the monster&#39;s form had changed from an impossibly attractive woman... to the face of an incredibly old woman with inhuman claws for hands and feet and barbs going inward between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;GAH! You little-!&quot; The hag snarled. &quot;I haven&#39;t had to show my real material manifestation in centuries! I&#39;m going to eat you and feel you squirm in my belly!&quot; The hag grew and grew in size to tower over the little cherub more than before. <br />
<br />
It finally occurred to Hopel she might be in trouble. &quot;Uh-oh.&quot; She looked at the bewildered James. &quot;Hey! Hey you! Help! I know this might sound like I&#39;m just trying to get you to join a DIFFERENT army, but I promise! What makes you &#39;you&#39; is the one part that won&#39;t vanish! PLEEEASE say you volunteer before I get eaten!&quot; <br />
<br />
James, not completely sure what was going on, but grasping the cherub was here to help, and was asking for his help, he said, &quot;Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the family!&quot; Hopel quickly touched James. There was a flash of light. Light blue scales covered his body, silver platting formed on the front of his lengthening torso. Silver claws replaced his fingers as he grew an EXTRA finger and toe on each limb, for a total of six claws on each! He felt a tale whip around as his spine grew, and felt his hair dark dark blue and trail along his back. Complete with whiskers and antler like horns growing from his head.<br />
<br />
James looked down at himself in awe he was... an angelic dragon, equal and opposite to the monstrous hell dragons he&#39;d seen in the sky and on the news, turning entire landscape to burning wastelands. He was also now the size of a child. <br />
<br />
He understood... he was now part of something greater, his entire being pulsed with purpose and meaning, his entire existence, his very soul had been remade, he was a beast of creation more than destruction, he was beautiful, he served something greater than himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I am going to CHEW before swallowing for that!&quot; The hag snarled, having grabbed Hopel and raising her up to her fanged maul. <br />
<br />
James breath super hot steam at the hag, who screamed, dropping Hopel. The cursed and snarled as she melted, before dissolving into a mass of peaceful flowers.<br />
<br />
Hopel panted, getting to her feet. &quot;Uh, thank you very much, I know I kinda rushed you through things there, but I was kinda cornered. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; the angelic dragon said. &quot;I gotcha. The name is James by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you James... or is it Jamesel now. Either way, welcome to our little resistance army of two... We&#39;re kinda gonna need more recruits.&quot;<br />
<br />
James shrugged, and shook Hopel&#39;s hand. &quot;I can guess we can plenty of humans we can draft or otherwise.&quot;</p>
