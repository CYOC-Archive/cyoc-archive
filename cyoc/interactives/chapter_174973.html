<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think you should forget about it and try some clothes on.  If you want to get home any time soon, you&#39;ll need to find some clothes that will fit your new body.&quot;  After carelessly tossing some clothes that clearly wouldn&#39;t fit toward Joanna&#39;s face, she gave a light slap to her daughter&#39;s udder.  &quot;Don&#39;t forget, you&#39;ll not be getting this milked until then, so try to make it quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna struggled to maintain her balance between her gargantuan rear, oversized breasts, and massive udder.  However, her mind wasn&#39;t entirely on what her mother was saying.  She wanted to figure out what her last argument had stolen from her mind.  She knew it was a pointless effort, but she had to have some kind of plan.  She gave a numb nod and slowly pulled her body into one of the booths.<br />
<br />
Joanna struggled to peel off her current clothes, with how tight they had become across her body.  As she did, she tried over and over to determine what parts of her were different.  She knew the udder was unnatural, and her breasts and butt weren&#39;t always this big, or...Maybe they weren&#39;t there at all?  Her lips had been relatively large for sure, but maybe her mother had exaggerated them with the chronivac?<br />
<br />
She took a mental step back.  This was a pointless effort, the chronivac was too good at modifying memories, or perhaps she was going at this from the wrong angle.  It doesn&#39;t matter what she believes she had or didn&#39;t have if she assumes anything and everything that makes her different from a completely normal person is her mother&#39;s fault.  At this point, who cares if she accidentally blamed her mother for something that she was born with?  With the chronivac, her mother could&#39;ve fixed it, so it&#39;s just as easily her fault as well.  Hopefully, this would stick with her no matter how many changes her mother performed on her.<br />
<br />
Having found new resolve, Joanna began the arduous process of undressing to try new clothes on.  The high-heels had been easy enough to kick off, though she found it odd that her body continued to stand on her toes once they were off.  Her stretched shirt took a bit longer, as she needed to both stretch the article of clothing more while also pressing her rack down to slip it off.  However, the hardest piece was easily her pants.  Her ass demanded a very firm grip to get the seam of the jeans around them, but her udder blocked her vision along with her hands, making the process agonizingly slow.  Even after getting them down to her knees, she found the jeans had been such a tight fit that she couldn&#39;t kick them off the rest of the way.  She was forced to sit on the much-too-small bench to completely remove them.<br />
<br />
Before she had even picked out one of the sets of clothes to try on, a new pile of clothes was shoved under the door.  &quot;Joanna, the employee found some more.  I want you to try each of these on, then come out and show me so I can decide whether or not it fits you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna balked at the idea.  Based on the number of pulses from her udder, it had taken her 4 minutes to just undress!  She had no idea how long it&#39;d take to get into each of these, meander out, wait for feedback, then put her regular clothes back on!  &quot;That&#39;s a terrible idea, but fine.&quot;  She internally cursed at her forced honesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s how you feel, I&#39;ll find some more clothes just for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna sighed as she felt her needy udder pulse once more.  <br />
<br />
*     *     *<br />
<br />
Time, and time again, it was the same.  Joanna would take several minutes putting on a new shirt and pants, she&#39;d walk outside, and her mother would call it terrible and send her back.  She&#39;d gone through 12 shirts, 8 pairs of pants, and 3 bras.  Each took precious minutes, and though the employee had picked decent enough clothes to fit her deformed body, she knew her udder had grown by a noticeable margin during this time.  Where before her breasts completely blocked the view of her udder, she could swear the sausage-like teats were now visible while standing.  It hung pendulously from her gut, and she found it harder to keep using the bench as the udder pulled her forward.  <br />
<br />
At least an hour had passed, and her mother hadn&#39;t picked a single article of clothing.  She finished buttoning up the latest pair of pants, then hauled her body back out of the changing room, to where her mother was waiting.  She sat on her phone, tapping about on it.  An all-too-familiar pulse from her udder prodded Joanna to speak up.  &quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother lazily looked up.  &quot;Awful.  It&#39;s like putting lipstick on a pig.  Put it back and get back into your regular clothes.  Maybe we&#39;ll just have to try somewhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna couldn&#39;t say she was surprised.  She saw this coming after the second rejection, but knowing that didn&#39;t make it any better.  Worse yet, all of the clothes had fit better than her original set.  &quot;Mom, all of these fit better than my current clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what a shame.  Get your old clothes back on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna muttered what she really thought under her breath as she got back into the changing room.  Discarding the clothes took only a little over a minute, but getting her old clothes back on was a terrible struggle.  She could hear the fibers snapping as her tortured shirt was once again pulled over her tits.  Her pants took 10 minutes alone, between fighting off her increasingly-heavy udder and slipping it past her posterior.  After she finally finished, she felt like a sausage compared to what she&#39;d tried out before.  She struggled her way out of the changing station, the effort of changing in and out with such a body had caused her to get winded.  <br />
<br />
Her mother stood up.  &quot;Finally ready, Jo-&quot;  she peered behind her daughter.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d leave those clothes, just strewn about!   Go on, pick them up, get them on their hangars, and put them back on the rack.  You ought to be nicer to the poor employees of this place.&quot; <br />
 <br />
The shortened, overweight employee stepped forward.  &quot;Actually, it&#39;s fine if-&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria glared daggers at the poor lady, and in a matter of moments she&#39;d gained another hundred pounds.  &quot;My daughter made the mess, I&#39;m just being a good parent by making her clean up her messes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your daughter clearly is in no condition t-&quot; her voice slowly deformed further and further as more weight was added to her frame in rolling layers of fat.  Though her clothes had miraculously shifted with the body, little was left to the imagination of how morbidly obese the employee had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re in any place to discuss conditions of anyone, butterball.  Do not stand between a mother and her child.  Now, go away and stock some shelves or whatever meaningless task you do here every day.&quot;  The employee shook her head and departed, allowing Gloria to again focus on her daughter.  &quot;Go on.  Pick up the clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna turned away from her mother and grit her teeth as she re-entered the changing booth.  She was too front-heavy to lean forward, she she instead resorted to squatting to grab a hangar or an article of clothing.  Unfortunately, this caused her sloshing udder to slap into the floor, creating both a terrible pang of pressure and an unnatural noise of flesh slapping on wood.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d only managed to get 3 hangars in when she heard the distinct sound of her pants splitting.  Paired with the sudden coolness she felt from her rear, it didn&#39;t take her long to realize what had happened.  She turned back to her mother, who covered her mouth and was clearly laughing.  Joanna stood back up, and turned to her.<br />
<br />
Her mother stopped laughing.  &quot;Well? I see plenty more clothes still on the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have a new pair of pants now that my current ones have split?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see after you&#39;ve finished cleaning up this mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna huffed, then spent the next 10 minutes slowly picking up the remaining clothes.  Each time she knelt down, she was reminded of the split as it attempted to widen.  With the last garment placed on the rack, she returned to her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, you&#39;ve done what you were told without raising a fuss.  That deserves a reward.&quot;  Her mother tapped something on the screen, and Joanna felt something strange occur, but not to her body.  The split in her pants mended itself.  Her shirt loosened.  The nipples of her breasts started scrunching inward, pressed in by a modified bra.  Lastly, her pants grew more comfortable.  &quot;Isn&#39;t that nice?  I found a way to shift clothes with reality!  None of this was necessary at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna couldn&#39;t believe this.  &quot;What was the point of making me wear all those clothes, then?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To find something that might look nice on my daughter, of course.  How was I to know nothing looks good on you?&quot;  She gave a knowing grin, clearly lying about her true intentions.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Whatever.  Can we go home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria tapped her phone on her chin.</p>
