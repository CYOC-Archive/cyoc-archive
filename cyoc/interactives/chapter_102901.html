<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben Twist quickly found himself growing to like Adeola and Bolade Adaeze, along with their younger daughter Kendra; his girlfriend&#39;s remaining family who was still living in New York City until after Kendra finished high school. Then they were planning to move to Moon Lake and reunite the entire clan once more.<br />
The men talked for a while about sports, with the brothers getting into a debate over the New York Jets versus the Seattle Seahawks. Ben admitted he was more of a baseball fan, and held his own with Adeola in discussing the Seattle Mariners against the New York Yankees, although Ben admitted he liked the Los Angeles Dodgers too, since Seattle didn&#39;t have a National League team as well.<br />
&quot;I can see the advantages of both sides,&quot; Ben told Adeola, when they started talking about the two leagues positions in regards to using a Designated Hitter. &quot;On one hand, it&#39;s less wear and tear on the pitchers. Yet despite the fact they&#39;re only in the line up every 5 to 6 days, you would think most pitchers would have better batting averages.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Kenya&#39;s father. &quot;Yet while every member of a team should be able to contribute and pull their weight, I miss the days when American League teams hired somebody specifically for the Designated Hitter position. A lot of clubs are now just rotating other players through that position to save money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon it was the ladies turn to talk, although Kendra was disappointed to find out that Ben was an only child.<br />
As mother, daughters, and sister-in-law conversed, Kenya&#39;s uncle Barry pulled Ben away from the webcam and ear shot of the others.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve done well,&quot; Barry assured Ben. &quot;My brother would talk a statue&#39;s ears off about sports, especially if he had a chance of winning any debates. The fact that you held your own in the conversation and didn&#39;t back away from the discussion spoke volumes as to your inner strengths to him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Ben, not commenting on his personal belief that a man&#39;s position on sports was an odd way to judge someone. &quot;But if I can ask, why are your two households dressed so differently?&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean my wife and I wearing more current clothing while my brother and his family wear more traditional garb?&quot; asked Barry. &quot;As the oldest, he feels it is his duty to do so to honor our father and forefathers. I will not dispute his beliefs, but do feel it is more what kind of person and were you are than what you wear that honors one&#39;s family.&quot;<br />
&quot;On that, we both agree. I just found out more about my natural parents today than I ever knew before. My memories of them are scarce, having lost them at such a young age,&quot; admitted Ben.<br />
&quot;Perhaps that is a conversation best had with your mothers,&quot; suggested Barry. &quot;But from what I have seen, I can tell you that I believe both sets would be very proud of you. I know my niece loves and thinks the world of you young man.&quot;<br />
&quot;And I of her,&quot; replied Ben. &quot;I meant what I said tonight. Someday, when I can...&quot; he added, thinking of a future with Kenya Twist.<br />
<br />
Eventually, especially with the time difference between west and east coast, the Skype conversation had to end. Everyone said good night to each other, with Adeola, Bolade, and Kendra once more welcoming Ben into the family; before the Internet connection was reluctantly broken.<br />
As Kenya shut down the computer, her aunt Tanya said, &quot;It is only a little after 10. Why don&#39;t you two youngsters take a short walk or <i>something</i>,&quot; she suggested. &quot;Your uncle and I will finish cleaning up for the night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just please remember to be back by midnight. I will need your help in the store tomorrow,&quot; Kenya&#39;s uncle reminded her.<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; said Kenya, holding Ben&#39;s hand in hers as they walked out the door.<br />
Once they were alone, Barry turned to his wife and asked, &quot;What is on your mind woman? You know we finished the cleaning before we called New York.&quot;<br />
Tanya looked at her husband with a surprised expression on her face as she replied, &quot;You have to ask, my husband?&quot; purring as she grabbed her mate by a hand and led him to their bedroom.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Kenya and Ben walked hand in hand, side by side, until they found themselves in the woods behind the houses on her side of the street.<br />
They had remained silent, enjoying the moment together until Ben leaned her against a tree and kissed his girlfriend.<br />
&quot;My werewolf, what do you think you are doing?&quot; she asked, as Kenya felt Ben slowly unzipping the back of her dress while following it with a trail of kisses.<br />
&quot;Expressing my love for the most wonderful woman it has ever been my honor to know,&quot; said Ben, as he let her dress fall to the ground.<br />
He massaged her butt cheeks while seductively removing her panties, because Kenya didn&#39;t need nor was wearing a bra.<br />
Then he moved around to face her again while kissing her once more. As Kenya stepped out of her clothes and shoes as she started to slip into her fursona, Ben began kissing his way down her furry neck, taking his time to enjoy a long suckling session at her breasts.<br />
Eventually, Ben kissed his way down past her stomach and soon had his beautiful werepanthress laying on the ground, her tail lashing about in pleasure as he laid between her legs and orally worshiped the sweet spot between them.<br />
Drinking deeply from her sacred chalice, it was not long before the internal waves of orgasmic bliss swept over her body, but Kenya found herself puzzled over the fact that Ben had not taken his clothes off, let alone was not releasing his inner werewolf.<br />
Kenya did not know how hard it was for her boyfriend not to give in to his baser instincts and plunge his lupine red rocket deep into her moist cunt.<br />
Thoughts of their time together this afternoon played in his mind as instead, Ben stayed between his girlfriend&#39;s furry legs and continued his oral feast.<br />
A second orgasm soon over took her, and a third.<br />
It wasn&#39;t until after she experienced her fourth that Kenya said, &quot;Ben, please. I cannot take any more at the moment. What has gotten into you my love?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just it darling. Love,&quot; he replied, moving up closer to cuddle. His still dressed and human form held her sleek furry body. &quot;I remember everything you said about the differences between sex and love*. I do love you Kenya, with all my heart and soul. Without trying to sound too emotionally sappy, I loved our time together in your room this afternoon before your aunt and uncle came home, and want all our private times together to be beautiful symphonies and not pop tunes on the radio,&quot; said Ben, before kissing her again.<br />
&quot;That is so sweet my darling Ben. Now let me—&quot;<br />
But before Kenya could finish that statement, the cellphone tangled within her discarded clothing began to chime.<br />
<br />
&quot;My alarm,&quot; realized Kenya, as she started reverting back to her human form. &quot;I must be heading home soon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sometime I want to enjoy the lady as well as the panthress,&quot; said Ben, before teasing one of his girlfriend&#39;s dark chocolate nipples on a mocha colored breast.<br />
&quot;You will my love. Neither of us has a curfew tomorrow night,&quot; Kenya reminded him, before crawling over to retrieve her clothing, giving Ben a good view of her rear in the process.<br />
&quot;Can you get to the store without using your moped?&quot; he asked, while standing up to dust himself off.<br />
&quot;Yes. Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll pick you up after you get off work tomorrow night. We&#39;ll have dinner, and then I know a wonderful spot where we can spend the night and watch the sunrise together Sunday morning,&quot; suggested Ben.<br />
&quot;You certainly know how to charm a lady Mister Twist,&quot; said Kenya with a smile, as she shimmied back into her dress.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re worth charming, for you have certainly charmed me,&quot; said Ben, kissing her again before walking Kenya home.<br />
