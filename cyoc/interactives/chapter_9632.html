<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doug rolled a four, and read the blue card:  “Lead the dual life you’ve always wanted, breathe air and water”  Doug had been a swimmer all his life, making the varsity team in high school.  Since getting to college, he’d put on about 60 pounds worth of beer gut and late night drunk foods, though Doug never seemed to notice the changes to his physique, and usually was the first one without a shirt on a hot day.  <br />
<br />
When he put the card down and tried to let go, it stuck to his fingers for a second, before dropping to the pile.  He rubbed his fingers together as he pulled his hand away, and it felt like he just dipped his hand in egg.  Doug examined his hand more closely, and his fingers and palms were wet and slimy, with the slime seemingly flowing around his hands and down his wrists.  He turned his hands over.  The hairs seemed to suck into his skin, and in their place slime welled up like sweat.  He followed this phenomenon up his arms.  By then, his hands were taking on a greenish tone.  The skin between his fingers started growing up.  Each flap connecting two fingers with a thin membrane all the way up to the last knuckle.  <br />
<br />
The slime wave continued over his face and head, then down his chest and back and into his shorts.  Coming along at a slower pace was the green color.  As it followed up his arms, they could see it leaving a speckled frog skin pattern.  As it engulphed doug’s head his ears flattened into the exposed eardrums of a frog.  His lips grew fuller and pushed out, along with his nose, blending into a short amphibious looking muzzle, though the face still was undeniably Doug’s.  <br />
<br />
By now he was completely hairless, and slimy down to his toes, though the real changes followed behind in the second wave, turning his skin green.  As it passed under the waistband of his shorts, it seemed that Doug’s tailbone grew down, in a straight line, poking his shorts like a boner.  This didn’t last though, as it soon began pushing his shorts down.  Realizing this, Doug pulled his shorts off altogether, revealing the smooth tail in the back, and his now, wet and shimmering smooth cock and balls in the front.  The green front finally reached the ends of his toes, leaving him with a huge set of webbed feet.  His tail kept going though, longer, but more dramatically, thicker.  Where it started from the base of his spine, it was nearly as thick as his abdomen above it, though probably only 6-7 feet long from there.  Doug, had trouble standing as his legs shifted to the side, and back, his ass curled under, leaving his rectum facing forward, below his balls.   He decided to flop backward onto the couch, rather than try to fight geometry and remain standing.  Soon the tail dominated his midsection completely, with his legs actually growing out of the side of the tail.  Doug was obviously not a frog after all, but some sort of salamander combination.  <br />
<br />
When he felt the changes had stopped, Doug crawled off the couch and onto all fours.  He hadn’t realized how much he had been craning his neck while sitting on the couch.  Down on all fours felt much more natural, as he faced straight ahead.  His legs jutted out horizontally from his tail, seemingly afterthoughts to whatever designer created this body.  Fortunately his genitals remained in tact.  <br />
<br />
Doug let out a small burp, and was startled when he realized, he wasn’t done changing.  His cheeks were filling in, followed by his neck.  Reaching a hand up and giving a squeeze, Doug discovered it was just fat, though it filled in his neck so completely it was hard to tell where his head ended and neck began.  This new wave of fat started down his back, to his shoulders and down his arms.  All the way through the webbing between his fingers, Doug got thick and fat.  His entire torso grew fat and rounded.  It didn’t stick like when a human gets fat, leaving distinct tits and a gut, instead Doug fattened more evenly, like a cylinder.  Down his tail, and legs, he grew thicker.  Faint parallel white lines appeared on his belly, and at the tops of his thighs.  A slimy webbed hand ran up and down the lines, and he realized they were stretch marks.  These are just about the spots he had grown stretch marks on his human body when he took his freshman 15 to the next level.  <br />
<br />
As Doug walked around on all fours, he moved like a lizard or salamander, with his whole body flexing sideways and back and fourth with every step.  Doug’s flabby sides bunched up, then stretched out when he took a step with the opposite foot, his belly nearly dragging on the floor, his tail was dragging on the floor.  Standing on two legs was nearly impossible with their new orientation, and his giant tail.  Doug climbed back onto the sofa and continued to examine his new slick body with his hands.  It wasn’t long before his slimy green cock perked up in approval.  <br />
<br />
“Get a room asshole” Joe was getting tired of watching this one ‘man’ strip show, and was getting nervous about his turn coming up next, both of which made him testy.</p>
