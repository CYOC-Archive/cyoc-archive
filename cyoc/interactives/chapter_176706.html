<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The half manifested demon appearance before Jen briefly shocking her before a comforting ease washed over her the demon etching fatherly familiarity into her mind while drawing white beams of residual white magic from the ashes and dust of the women that perished moments before eventually booming in his unique voice while doing so<br />
<br />
“I am Xuatillitchin, I went by many names before resigning myself to my own dimension this dimension trillions of years ago before this place became a Petri dish for the gods, many religions deemed me their devil... I acquired many powers through my devouring of other divine entities mastering the ability to warp, transfer, change, morph and alter matter... But what these women have harnessed was aspects that belonged to beings who would want to desperately be rid of me I grant you now with three different segments of three different areas of three different deities they called them selves my enemy one of these girls each had one of these disciplines you can revive human beings now if you want, create new life, and jump dimensions. For now on you trigger my presence in your inner core you won’t need that flimsy ring and thought out wishes just speak your desires, well as best as you know how daughter and it’ll pick up the pace.”<br />
<br />
In a bright flash he disappeared and all the people who are freaking out at the beach watching demons in magic happen before their very eyes seem to have switched back to their place is completely reset treating it like it’s just another sunny vacation day. Jen submitted to the energies she would now never understand and she smiled moronically as a pressure begin building up in her head her mind becoming even more ditzy, materialistic and impulsive becoming hubris filled as she became dumber and dumber forgetting her education as reality altered In this reality Jennifer was a beautiful young girl who dropped out in grade 2 after being held back repeatedly for not being able to retain any information for some reason and continuously babbling in broken English unable to string together her words effectively without straining her head in thought. Jen’s memories swirled in her head like a blender rewriting itself for one last final time her parent Xuatillitchin a single father decided to start entering her in pageants and enrolled her in modeling school. Luckily before her father had to go back into the 7th dimension he hired a soft spoken Korean girl named Cassandra to dress, wipe, and bathe his daughter Jen being under constant supervision by a nervous, timid, and disrespected pimply skinny girl.<br />
<br />
 Giggling not knowing she had become a husk with a bogus back story. Jen began staring down at her ring as it began melding becoming a blackened obsidian looking material feeling warmer than usual the aspiring starlet begin freaking out at the ring liquefied racing up her arm snaking it’s way down her back and plunging itself deep inside her anal cavity. Her blue mesmerizing eyes glowed in a familiar light that shone off of the leathery demon’s back during it’s duel with the three sorceresses. The magic return to its neutral state no longer being amplified upon it’s harness seal failing as her deity father departed going back to the realm where he can retain his life energy expecting to use you as a sort of ambassador to recolonize his lost planet Her electric surges on her fingers reduce the sparkles fading away remaining inside of her for further use. Her mind having turned into Swiss cheese with her memories becoming essentially a novelized fabrication brought into reality by a notorious monster with questionable goals.<br />
<br />
Almost absentmindedly giggling practically brain dead at this point Jen pointed at Lance.<br />
 <br />
“Lance wearing pretty twosomes, shine nail, purple head, facey face!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly the chauffeur shook and trembled as his Expensive tailored work suit became a skimpy ill fitting red Gucci bikini that failed to contain his 9” cock causing it to spill from a leg hole His chiseled lantern jarred face began to become adorned slightly with tasteful make up his eyelashes lengthening and his lips inflating a little bit, His fingernails and toenails becoming adorned with a bright pink polish, lastly his short crew cut spilling down his beefy back becoming silky and reaching his firm ass. The muscular chiseled handsome black man came to smiling somehow understanding Jen’s Gibberish. Cassandra looking him over felt irresistible horny ness. <br />
<br />
“Hey yeah thanks for noticing Jen you know most people wouldn’t let their chauffeurs wear nice designer bikinis on the job as they experiment with female dressing, let alone invite them to the beach!”<br />
<br />
Jen vaguely remembering that she could create life Pointed her finger at a seven-year-old Latvian girl on vacation with her family who was building a sandcastle.<br />
“Babies!”<br />
<br />
Watching mesmerized  Jen, Lance and Cassandra watched as the little girl’s gut started pushing out. The little blonde girl started panicking crying she ran over to her family but it seemed as though her mother and father didn’t even know who she was that made her even scream even harder in hysterics. The screaming bloating seven year old girl would’ve caused a scene had Jen’s power is not ripped her away temporary from the fabric of reality. The screaming crying girl was throwing a tantrum as her belly swelled larger than her body could sustain staying upright. The petite blonde Lithuanian girl laid on her back going catatonic as two tiny mucus based forms slipped out lubercated by their own bodies they crawled out of the past out little girls butt hole ripping her seat of her one piece apart as the mucous monsters walked away towards Jen.<br />
<br />
The mucus monsters became more and more humanoid feminine even the curvy hips and breast the size of Jen’s. Becoming Flesh and blood they look like older bimbo versions of the Latvian girl pooped out. Coughing and sputtering they drew their first breath followed by their first giggles they went over to the beach towel for the past out seven years old with a ripped bathing suit was laying near proximity of her parents. The former mucus monsters became incredibly charming and witty becoming the ultimate honey potters. Within five minutes of speaking to the Lithuanian girls father and mother they had convinced them to go to the public changing rooms for individual bang sessions.<br />
<br />
The attractive svelte blondes that were created through the dark magic that now imbued the airheaded bimbo Jen were leading the parents by hand when</p>
