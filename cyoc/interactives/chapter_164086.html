<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The early morning light was peeking through the window shade.   <br />
<br />
Walking gingerly toward the bathroom door, he stooped slightly as  standing full upright increased the need to express his bladder, not to  mention a slight twinge in his lower back caused him to slouch slightly  to quell the small, sharp pain.  <br />
<br />
He reached for the doorknob and missed, fumbling he redirected his aim a  little higher and turned the knob and walked in.  He ran a hand blindly  along the wall reaching for a light switch, again finding one a little  higher than his first flailing attempt. Sensing relief, he grasped the  belt buckle and fumbled with it until he felt it release and the belt  loosen slightly.   He tried to pull the pants down but they stopped,  wedged against his hips and he realized he would have to undo the button  and zipper to get them all the way down.  The sense of urgency  increased with each passing heartbeat as he fumbled clumsily with  button, finally ripping it off out of frustration and panic sending it  shooting across the room, hitting the closet door and bouncing onto the  vanity with a click.  He jerked the pants down, along with a handful of  underwear down and out of habit, made a grab for his penis, only to feel  his fingers bury themselves in a patch of soft pubic hair.  He groaned  and turned to sit, jumping up with a yelp as cold plastic met warm flesh  because in his haste, he had forgot to lift the lid.  Cursing, he  turned and flung the thin plastic up and turned to sit again, this time  hitting his mark.  He paused, as if to ponder what to do next.  Relaxing  and spreading his legs slightly, a sudden burst of fluid half streamed  and half sprayed from between his legs, down into the toilet bowl.  The  relief was instant, and as quickly as it had started, it stopped.   Arching his back he looked up and sighed, “That was close…” he thought. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Reaching over to grab a handful of toilet paper, he felt cooling drops  of moisture collect and drip into the water below.   Taking a deep  breath he reached straight down between Joy’s legs to dry, gingerly he  dabbed at the area.  Unable to see what he was aiming at, he just  pressed the wad of paper against the entire area.  The feeling was so  strange as the paper pressed against Joy’s anatomy, sensations his brain  struggled to register were being created by the pressure of the tissue  in his hand against his borrowed equipment and he must have used a half  of a roll of paper before he felt he was satisfactorily dry.   Before he  stood to pull his pants up, he stole a glance at the two, pale and  hairless thighs that extended out before him as he sat on the toilet.   He touched the right one carefully, his hand felt warm on the cool, soft  flesh.  It, like it’s counterpart on the left side looked thinner than  “his” thighs.  While the skin appeared to be completely smooth, there  was a distinct presence of stubble, indicating Joy had not shaved her  legs, or upper portion at least, for a couple of days.  He remembered  how his ex wife would alternate between shaving the entire leg or just  the bottoms depending upon need.  <br />
<br />
Sliding his hand down over the soft,  round knee, he felt the shin area and how it was considerable smoother  than the thigh and concluded that Joy had followed the same practice of  only shaving the entire leg when necessary.  He couldn’t believe that  these two smooth and feminine legs were attached to his body as he  paused to think about how running his hand over the smooth legs would  under normal circumstances cause some arousal, but at this point he felt  nothing.  Looking down, he saw how just below his chest, about 6 inches  there was a distinct line where his mildly hairy chest and upper  stomach stopped and completely smooth and paler skin started.  A slight  paunch of a belly was interrupted only with a few dimples of cellulite  and an oval shaped navel that Jon gingerly stuck a finger into.  Below  that, the pale skin was completely bare except for a small patch of  strawberry blonde pubic hair resting at the conjunction of the slightly  parted creamy thighs.  <br />
<br />
Holding the waist of the pants closed with one hand, he started to walk  carefully out into the bedroom.   As he passed the bathroom mirror, he  caught a glimpse of the side view of his body. His tee shirt hung below  his waist, but the profile was not that of which he was used to seeing  and he swallowed hard when his focus fell upon the swell of Joy’s  rounded butt from underneath the tee shirt.  Putting the vision out of  his mind he walked out into the bedroom trying to ignore strange  sensations emitting from his crotch as his thighs gently rubbed together  with each step.  He tried hard also to not focus on the way his butt  cheeks jiggling slightly with each step he took.  The underwear Joy had  been wearing yesterday fit snugly but for some reason it felt as if  half of each butt cheek was hanging out, rubbing against the more course  cotton blended material of the uniform bottoms and moving  uncontrollably with each step on the hard floor.  To quell the feelings,  he started taking shorter strides that seemed to help somewhat and even  made walking a little more comfortable.  <br />
<br />
Deciding to use the phone in the kitchenette, he walked out the bedroom  door and down the hall, getting more and more confident with each small  step.  Looking down, he still couldn’t believe that the small feet were  now his and he swayed a little bit as he lost concentration and lost his  balance for a moment.  He thought it was best just to keep his eyes up  and focus on getting from A to B before he fell and broke his neck.   An  object near the front door caught his eye so he walked over to it and  bent over carefully to pick it up.  Bending at the waist he groaned  slightly as the slight pain in his lower back returned causing him to  step forward slightly and kneel to finally grasp the yellow envelope.   Using the door knob for leverage, he stood back upright and made is way  to the kitchen counter.   Detective Jon James was hand written on the  outside.  A note was inside, it was telling him that there was a change of clothes  in the duffel bag on the kitchen table and to pick what he needed and  return the rest to Dr. Jackson’s office when he came for his examination  at 7:00.  Walking to the kitchen table, he opened the bag and dumped it  onto the counter top.  He found a pair of blue sweat pants that fit a  little snug in the butt but otherwise were a good fit if not a little  too long in the legs.  Joy obviously had a shorter than normal in-seem  which would explain some of his loss of height.  The only foot gear  provided was a pair of what looked to be one size fit’s all medical  slippers, that were slightly too large but functional and there was not a  change of underwear provided</p>
