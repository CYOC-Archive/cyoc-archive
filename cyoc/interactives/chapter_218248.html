<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate clopped in place awkwardly. Was <i>everyone</i> going to end up doubling up tonight? He could try to find someone he knew in a single cot, or maybe hop in an empty one and hope no one came up behind him?<br />
<br />
“Haw, come on.” Forty gave his ear a soft tug. He pointed down at one of the empty beds.<br />
<br />
Or… Or One Seventeen could just let Forty take the lead.<br />
<br />
The tall donkey stood in front of the cot. He stretched out for a moment before flopping down on the bedding. He gently patted the space next to him.<br />
<br />
Here goes nothing…! One Seventeen climbed into the bed. The two sank down into the middle, and Nate got the distinct impression that he was going to be the little spoon tonight.<br />
<br />
“Relax newbie.” Forty slid down in the cot, his chest pressing up against Nate’s back, “They’ve only got enough beds for about half of us to sleep by ourselves.”<br />
<br />
Forty buried his nose into Nate’s ear, “But you wanna be in one by the door. You get to breakfast earlier that way.”<br />
<br />
Nate could feel the donkey rest his muzzle on his shoulder like a pillow. Forty’s sheath was pressed up against his rear, but not really in a flirty way. He was just settling in for the night.<br />
<br />
He could already feel his chest start to rise and fall. It dawned on One Seventeen that the room was really quiet. They must have programmed all these donkey men not to snore?<br />
<br />
One Seventeen did his best to get comfortable and fall asleep. Everyone else here seemed to immediately drift off, but he had never been able to do that. He was going to spend the next hour just laying there thinking about the sheath pressed up against him and-<br />
<br />
Nate felt someone nudge his shoulder. A groggy-eyed Forty shook him awake, “Come on, I smell oatmeal.” He grinned.<br />
<br />
“Haw, right…!” One Seventeen slid off the cot, clopping to his feet. What a restful night’s- Eep!<br />
<br />
His balance felt a little off. His tail swished to compensate, but-<br />
<br />
“Come on…!” Forty whispered. He grabbed One Seventeen’s hand, tugging him towards the front room of the door.<br />
<br />
“Discrete” and “Hooves” didn’t really go hand in hand. Most of the room was waking up at this point. As Forty tugged him into the hallway, One Seventeen tried to take stock of himself.<br />
<br />
He was <i>furry</i>. All of his changes up until now had been focused on one spot. A tail, some hooves, donkey ears. This was… different. It was like someone had taken a big dial labeled “Fur” and slowly cranked it up. Short gray furs had grown out everywhere on his body. His arms, his legs, his chest, his stomach.<br />
<br />
His stomach…!<br />
<br />
One Seventeen realized why his balance felt so off now. He had a massive gut dangling off his front. It felt strange seeing it on him, but he recognized the bulk and heft from his other short and stout donkeys.<br />
<br />
Forty’s tail wouldn’t stop wagging, “I hope they put apples in today.” He grinned, getting in line for breakfast. A few donkeys in line had gotten their jumpsuits on already, but most were naked like him and Forty.<br />
<br />
It took One Seventeen a moment to realize he was naked. It just… didn’t phase him. He got a few early morning, “That you Newbie?” light teases, but otherwise people were just as eager for breakfast as Forty was. As discretely as possible, Nate glanced down at the Chronivac on his wrist to try and see what had changed about him.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Attribute Modified: Donkey Fur (50%)“</i><br />
<i>&quot;Attribute Modified: Weight Increased (45 lb)”</i><br />
<i>&quot;Attribute Added: Donkey Sheath.”</i><br />
<i>&quot;Attribute Added: Donkey Eyes.”</i><br />
<i>&quot;Attribute Modified: Height Decreased (5”)”</I><br />
<br />
One Seventeen stared at the list. Haw! Owen was moving really quickly now! He glanced up at Forty curiously. Wow, the tall donkey really did seem taller. Then One Seventeen’s donkey train of thought finally caught up with him. Did that say sheath!?<br />
<br />
He glanced down between his legs. Nate instead just saw his dangling furry stomach. He… couldn’t see his cock without a mirror. He reached down awkwardly, trying to feel between his legs.<br />
<br />
Nate’s hands ran over a furry pouch. Haw! He could feel the outline of his cock and balls underneath it and-<br />
<br />
“Knock that off,” Forty nudged him, “It’s almost our turn.” He pointed up at the line.<br />
<br />
“Haw! When were you going to tell me I had a sheath!?” One Seventeen brayed. Perhaps a bit too loudly.<br />
<br />
“We’ve… all got sheaths?” Forty tilted his head, “Oh, yours just came in last night?” He licked his lips.<br />
<br />
One Seventeen nodded, “Uh huh.” He gave it one more brush, then grabbed a plastic tray.<br />
<br />
Forty’s ear twitched, “Well remind everyone after work.” He gave One Seventeen a bucktooth grin, “We’ll have to help break you in tonight.”<br />
<br />
Hee haw! One Seventeen… kinda liked the sound of that. The “We” was a little ambiguous there though. Did he mean the card donkeys from last night, or just… everyone?<br />
<br />
The two plopped down at a new table of donkeys. Every meal it seemed like he was sitting with a new group of people. Their social circles felt as interchangeable as the donkeys themselves.<br />
<br />
Finally it was time for work. One Seventeen actually felt like he was looking forward to zoning out during his trash duty. His tail wagged a bit as he made his way over to the lockers. Something told him his uniform was going to fit better today.<br />
<br />
“Haw, hey One Seventeen!” Five flagged him down. One Seventeen had already started to get in the habit of reading his fellow donkey’s ear tags. He flicked his ears forward as a courtesy to Five, although it must have been clear he was talking to the right donkey.<br />
<br />
“You don’t need to suit up just yet.” His supervisor explained, “They want you on warehouse duty this afternoon. They have a nice standard load being brought in, perfect for a Newbie.” The donkey held up the increasingly-familiar VR headset, “We need to get you trained beforehand.”<br />
<br />
“Haw! Right.” One Seventeen nodded, “Another few hours then sir?” He pointed back at the break room couch.<br />
<br />
“You got it.” Five patted him on the back. “You’re starting to come along nicely by the way!”<br />
<br />
“Hee haw! Thank you!” One Seventeen waved. He got comfortable on the sofa and then slowly slid the headset over his face. Once again the fit wasn’t perfect… the weight of this thing was really set up for someone with a muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Welcome back One Seventeen!” The cheerful announcer greeted him.<br />
<br />
One Seventeen found himself back on the virtual farm. He had just finished breakfast, so the virtual grass didn’t look <i>quite</i> as appetizing as before.<br />
<br />
“Have you been <i>Serving</i> and <i>Obeying</i> since our last session?” The voice asked in a pleasant but stern tone.<br />
<br />
This was already feeling really nice. One Seventeen’s mouth was dangling open in a content droop, but he was at least able to nod for the nice computer.<br />
<br />
“Good donkey.” It responded back in kind. “It’s good that you need to <i>serve</i> and <I>obey</i>. Today, let’s go a level deeper. One Seventeen, you want to <i>serve</i> and <I>obey</i>.”<br />
<br />
One Seventeen couldn’t exactly respond. He just nodded his head like a good donkey. He wasn’t sure what the big difference between needing and wanting though.<br />
<br />
“Good donkey.” The voice repeated. “Your work assignment says that you’re scheduled for warehouse duty today. Let’s get you trained for that new task.”<br />
<br />
He nodded again. One Seventeen was ready for a morning of boring corporate training slides. Instead, a window simply appeared in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Downloading Warehouse Training…” There was a large progress bar, and it was quickly filling up from zero to a large number. One Seventeen’s mind started to wander. The screen kept flashing the numbers of some of the donkeys he had met. He kept himself busy trying to remember how tall each of the numbers were.<br />
<br />
Finally, the voice came back. “We’re all done for today One Seventeen. You may remove the headset now.”<br />
<br />
One Seventeen realized he could move his arms again. Had he not been able to use them before? He reached up, tugging the headset off of his head.<br />
<br />
He was met by a rush of excitement. The headset had once again left him obscenely erect. One Seventeen was expecting not to be able to see his bones, but to his surprise he could see the top half of a glistening black donkey shaft bobbing over his stomach.<br />
&#8232;Haw! This was his favorite part of corporate trainings…! He reached down, gently teasing his shaft. Hee haw! Oh man, he had seen a couple of these the last few days, but using one himself was another experience entirely. One Seventeen slid his hands up and down, seeing just how high he could build his excitement.<br />
<br />
Then he noticed the notification on his wrist. Hmpf. He really didn’t want to stop now, but it would just take a second to see what had changed.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Mental Adjustment: Corporate Brainwashing (Moderate).”</i><br />
<i>&quot;Mental Adjustment: Corporate Warehouse Training (Expert).”</i><br />
<i>&quot;Mental Adjustment: Name Deleted.”</i><br />
<i>&quot;Mental Adjustment: Desires Updated.“</i><br />
<br />
Haw! He wasn’t expecting a list that long! He... Haw, he wasn’t really being brainwashed, was he? The headset was just giving him the job training he needed. One Seventeen wagged excitedly, realizing he new exactly how to be a perfect warehouse donkey. He felt like he had spent years getting good at it!<br />
<br />
Then he saw the next notification. Haw? That was ridiculous. His name was… was…<br />
<br />
One Seventeen’s heart started to beat faster. He had thought about his name a bit this morning, hadn’t he? Hee haw! He was… He was Donkey One Seventeen! That’s the only thing that came to mind!<br />
<br />
His cock throbbed a bit harder at the realization. Hee haw! Had- Had Owen done this, or was it part of the headset? His old identity seemed completely out of reach…! Hee haw! Had his owners done this intentionally? The next time he saw Mr. Smith he was going to… to…<br />
<br />
One Seventeen was going to thank him for this exciting work opportunity. Haw! Wait- what? He- One Seventeen wanted to <i>serve</i> Paper Corp, and there was no better way to do it than becoming a Paper Corp Donkey. His tail started to wag excitedly as he thought of how lucky he was that Mr. Smith had given him this chance.<br />
<br />
What was going on…!? Any time One Seventeen tried to muster up any anger or resentment forwards Paper Corp, it suddenly turned into admiration and praise. And why wouldn’t it? It was one of One Seventeen’s strongest desires to <i>serve</i> Paper Corp.<br />
<br />
He shook his head, feeling his ears flap up against his cheeks. Haw! O-okay, this was getting intense. Now One Seventeen was starting to understand why his fellow donkeys acted the way they did.<br />
<br />
“Owen… You can get me out of this when my time’s up, right?” One Seventeen whispered to his watch nervously.<br />
<br />
He must have made more noise than he thought. Five poked his head around one of the lockers.<br />
<br />
“Ah, One Seventeen, looks like you’re done!” His supervisor’s eyes flicked down, “Go hit the showers.”<br />
<br />
One Seventeen obeyed, raising to his hooves. “Yessir.” He nodded.<br />
<br />
He started to clop towards the showers. The dangling donkey manhood between his legs was making it surprisingly difficult to clop though.<br />
<br />
“Uh- Five.” One Seventeen ran his fingers along his shaft, “It’s not going down.”<br />
<br />
“Newbie…” Five rolled his eyes, “Come on.”<br />
<br />
Five reached down to his jumpsuit, quickly tugging down the zipper. He tossed it onto a nearby bench, and then lead One Seventeen to the showers.<br />
<br />
“At some point you’re going to have to take care of this on your own.” Five chided him.<br />
<br />
One Seventeen blushed, “Haw, I tried…! It won’t go down!”<br />
<br />
Five turned the water on, getting some steam going. “Hee haw, the corporate trainings level out at some point.” He grinned, “And you figure out what makes these tick.”<br />
<br />
His supervisor got down onto his knees, “For example… I bet it feels pretty nice… here?” The donkey smirked, sliding his fingers along the underside of One Seventeen’s shaft.<br />
<br />
“Hee haw! Yessir!” One Seventeen thrusted his hips. The flat tip of his shaft was already starting to get glossy.<br />
<br />
“This is seriously like looking in a mirror.” Five rubbed between his legs, teasing his sheath, “Let’s see… I like it when…”<br />
<br />
Five leaned forward, licking the pre off of One Seventeen’s tip.<br />
<br />
“Hee haw!” One Seventeen felt his legs buckle. He was lucky the floor had rubber non-slip mats. He tried to say something, anything, but all he could manage to do was bray.<br />
<br />
“That’s a good donkey…” Five grinned, running his tongue along One Seventeen’s manhood. Hee haw! He could feel his tail start to wag at the praise.<br />
<br />
One Seventeen put his hand on Five’s head, holding him in place. Wait, Five knew what made him tick. That must mean…<br />
<br />
“Good… donkey…!” One Seventeen brayed between moans. Now <i>that</i> got Five wagging.<br />
<br />
Hee haw…! They both just wanted to be… good donkeys! One Seventeen rocked his hips, feeling the excitement build. Five started using both of his hands now and… and…<br />
<br />
“Oh haw…!” He was going to cum! Five knew it too. The donkey slid his muzzle down the length of One Seventeen’s shaft, lapping up as much of his seed as he could.<br />
<br />
Which wasn’t all of it. Haw! Climaxing with a donkey cock felt like waving a gardening hose around! No wonder Five came to the showers with him!<br />
<br />
“Haw… Feeling better?” Five grinned. He got back to his hooves, grabbing a hoof full of soap from the wall mounted dispenser.<br />
<br />
“Yessir, thank you.” One Seventeen nodded. “I’ll do you next time.”<br />
<br />
“Atta boy!” Five slapped him on the back. Then he started working some of the soap into One Seventeen’s mane. Hee haw! Woah, cleaning this much fur was a two donkey job!<br />
<br />
His supervisor stated to quiz him down about warehouse operations while they got cleaned up. The answers flowed easily and effortlessly out of One Seventeen’s mouth. He didn’t know what his name was, but he could recall all sorts of obscure pallet loading procedures.<br />
<br />
Finally the two were ready to head back out. One Seventeen got to experience the fur driers as they were meant to be used for once.<br />
<br />
“Haw, come on, let’s go get dressed.” Five waved a hoof.<br />
<br />
One Seventeen ran a hoof over his miraculously dried fur. He had been moments away from clopping off to the warehouse. He couldn’t help but wonder how many donkeys showed up to work naked.</p>
