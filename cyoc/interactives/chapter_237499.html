<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan Oscar Masterson had not expected his day to turn out like this. He had expected his shift overseeing the condemned grandstand to be another eight hours of boring nothing. This part of town was derelict but uneventful. Nobody cared, and there was -- so he thought -- nothing at the grandstand that would attract ne&#39;er-do-wells. The most he had done in a week of &quot;work&quot; was chase off some rambunctious kids.<br />
<br />
Standing 6&#39;5&quot; and built like a tank, he found his stature useful in his current occupation. Not that he had to use force often -- it was in fact discouraged -- but most people found the bearded behemoth intimidating. He had dark brown hair, his beard was bushy and barely up to professional standards, his bare forearms tanned and hairy. His deep-set, tired eyes had also been dark brown.<br />
<br />
They <i>had</i> been. As the naked weirdo waved his hand as if to literally brush him off, an arc of light shot out at him. Bryan raised his left arm to shield himself, reaching for his nightstick to ward off the &quot;attack&quot;. His fingers never reached it however, as the light engulfed him and filled him with warm lassitude. He saw his clothes and flesh began to glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot;<br />
<br />
He stared at his uplifted arm, as his hand grew slender and feminine, his forearm slimmed down, hair and tan disappearing. The bulk of muscle flowing away from his limb and into his chest as the changes spread across him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He-ell?&quot; His voice broke as his Adam&#39;s apple faded, and faded into a sultry moan as he felt his nipples expand and push against his shift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh? Ohhhhh...!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like he was melting. Not in a bad way -- unlike Kevin there was no pain. The closest he could compare it to was relaxing in a pool, or in bed after a hot shower. But it wasn&#39;t just tension dissipating. His whole body was running like wax and being remolded, like the massages he fantasised about but never got. From his left arm, to his chest, then his other arm and legs -- bone and muscle thinning out, thighs growing thick, the manly chest thicket disintegrating from his chest as it swelled out into large, perky boobs.<br />
<br />
His face becoming narrow, his nose petite, his cheekbones high and prominent. His beard wiped away as his lips grew soft and sensual. His eyes taking on a wide almond shape, their irises brightening to a crystal blue, lines of stress smoothing away around them. His receding brown hair grew back in as thick, long, lustrous natural platinum blonde, falling about his now narrow shoulders. Leaving him with the face of a youthful, intelligent woman; a woman whose ears tapered up to pointed tips.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ohhhh... ohhhh it feels...!&quot;<br />
<br />
The warmth blossomed from relaxing to blissful as Bryan&#39;s sex pulled in, a womb opening up and testicles-turned ovaries settling in place; empty scrotum splitting into puffy labia, cock compacting into a pulsing clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soo goood...&quot; She moved her arms in a daze, feeling her expansive chest and her female crotch through her clothes. Forgetting in the melty lust that she had an audience. &quot;I... I&#39;m a woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt a weight lift from her. Decades of unhappiness evaporated as her new identity rooted in her brain. She was a woman, an elf woman, and she had always been. It was confusing, because she still <i>remembered</i> Bryan, the sad man prematurely worn-out in his forties; but she wasn&#39;t him any more.<br />
<br />
She moaned again as her clothing shifted to something better fitting her lithe femininity. She felt a silk military bra form around her upper torso, containing and supporting her mighty bust in a vaguely erotic embrace. Her shirt became a gambeson and a coat of fine elven mail formed over it, both falling to her thighs. Her company vest turned into a blue surcoat, the blazon of a pair of crossed golden swords stretching over her bosom. Her security guard cap morphed into a steel helm, complete with cheek- and nose-guards that gave her face an extra sharpness, her silver-gold hair spilling out from beneath it. Her pants became form-fitting leather dyed purple, tucked into trim black leather boots shod with steel. She gained gauntlets to match; and a short, waist-length cape, a rich purple like her trousers, materialised around her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Completing the ensemble, her nightstick grew into a longsword, scabbard hanging from her belt, which was now black leather with a gilded buckle. Alongside it hung a pouch, heavy with the former contents of her pockets.<br />
<br />
The light faded away, together with the melty arousal; leaving behind a slender, lightly muscled and pleasantly top-heavy elven guadrswoman. Her skin smooth, pale and flawless, not a hair on her except for her flowing platinum locks and delicate eyebrows and long lashes. While not nearly as big as the hulk she had been, she still stood tall at 6&#39;1&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bemused now, she stopped feeling herself up; she couldn&#39;t feel too much through the steel mesh and padded tunic anyway. And she recalled the strange man who had started this. Blushing faintly, she looked up.<br />
<br />
Her blushed deepened as she saw the guy now sported a raging boner, a fat six inches arching almost straight up against his beer gut.<br />
<br />
<center>~ 0 ~</center><br />
Kevin gaped as the light he had inadvertantly unleashed consumed the man and began reshaping him. He felt his loins tingle and his cock jerk as the big security&#39;s body became -- from his point of view -- a smooth, lucent figure of flowing blue-white, that morphed into a sexy, busty woman. Not <i>naked</i> exactly, but the next best thing.<br />
<br />
Even when the light faded and her clothing came back into focus, she was still damn fine. Her uniform fit her like a glove, clearly showing off her bust, her tight waist, and her lovely hips.<br />
<br />
Lust wasn&#39;t the only thing that made him stare though -- Kevin was, to put it lightly, gobsmacked. He hadn&#39;t processed his own changes or the thunderous voice in his head, and now he was witness to another transformation -- one that he had apparently caused, though he had no fucking clue how. He wasn&#39;t even conscious of his erection as he gaped at the tall, armoured beauty in front of him.<br />
<br />
So he jumped when the guard cleared her throat. This made his cock slap against his belly, sending a burst of pleasure and shame through him. Now he blushed too, and turned a little to the side, trying to hide his hard-on with a hand. Kevin was not the <i>most</i> considerate man, but he wasn&#39;t a creep either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Err, um... sorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
The elf laughed, a clear beautiful sound that brought a spark of joy to Kevin&#39;s heart despite the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries, sir. I... was a man, not that long ago. I know it&#39;s not easy to control. But...&quot; She sighed. &quot;Look, something weird is obviously going on here, something far beyond the pay-grade of my wretched employment. From the look of you, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening either, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; he half-growled, reminded now of the whole bizarre, awkward mess; and his concern at the metal threading its way through his skin. &quot;I was just lookin&#39; for junk to sell. Then I found this fucking medallion, put it on, and bang!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Medallion?&quot; She took a few steps closer, managing a sexy strut in her guard uniform as though it came natural to her. But Kevin shook off the distraction, and turning to face her put a hand on his chest, his other still clumsily trying to screen his phallus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it... fused to my chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my.&quot; She stopped and gazed at him, her keener elven eyes now picking out that what she had previously thought was body paint was now real metal embedded in him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah...&quot; Silence descended, Kevin shuffling a bit under the gaze of the woman. If he didn&#39;t know better, he would have thought she was checking him out. Deciding that she must be mad at him, he managed to mumble, &quot;Uh... sorry about turning you into a chick...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! No, on the contrary,&quot; she said with an earnest smile, &quot;thank you so much for setting me free! I... owe you.&quot; Her gaze lingered on his cock. It was average in length, but above average in thickness. And she felt a strong urge to repay this man. This being, rather, for she now sensed that there was something much greater in him than he appeared; and to her, he appeared as a saviour.<br />
<br />
But right now she had other things to sort out. Such as how she knew she was <i>supposed</i> to belong to the Golden Blades, the best mercenary company in the lovely metropolis of Caramellyn; but was in fact employed by Glover Security. A tight-fisted firm which she doubted would just overlook the loss of the vest and badge they had given her. But screw them, she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest for now we both go home and assess our lives,&quot; she said to the man, who didn&#39;t seem to know how to respond to her thanks. She blushed a bit, and fumbled over herself, until the realization clicked that she now had a belt purse. She reached inside, sighing in relief as she found her pen and notepad. She scribbled on it, and held it out to Kevin. &quot;My number. In case you ever want to... talk.&quot; She smiled seductively, feeling a surge of confidence in her sexuality. &quot;My name is Elwen, by the Elwen Silverlock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks.&quot; Kevin took the paper, glancing at it. It was a phone number, address, and the name &quot;Elwen&quot; in flowing cursive. &quot;I&#39;ll... be seeing you.&quot; He recognised that she was coming on to him. He couldn&#39;t figure out why, but he was not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fare well until we meet again. And put some clothes on,&quot; she teased with a slight smile. Then she turned, pulling her thankfully intact cellphone from her purse to call in sick. Belatedly realising as she did so that her vocabulary and manner of speech had changed.<br />
<br />
Kevin picked up his shovel and metal detector. They felt oddly... mundane, after all that happened, but they were his. Shame dissipated now that the woman had her back to him, he strolled with unusual briskness to his dented pick-up, tossed his tools in the passenger seat, then drove back to his house, praying that a policeman wouldn&#39;t pull him over or something.</p>
