<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amber found this situation a bit bizarre. After picking up the remote vague memories of the previous realities began to flicker in her mind. Most prominent was what she always knew to be true, she was a horse-morph dancer/waitress at a club owned by Ruby, a massive disembodied cock with a score of tentacle-cocks attacked to her black and shiny form. But versions of Ruby as a skunk-morph also exist, as well as ones where Amber didn’t have her massive balls, or her four beach ball-sized breasts and pussy anus and mouth, or didn’t have a cock, or was a human.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take much though to understand that the woman-cock that now sat between her legs had used the remote judiciously to transform not only herself, but every single person in this club. Rather than be put off by this however, it only made the horse-morph excited to make use of the power that had now fallen into her hands. <br />
<br />
Amber’s massive living cock and humongous balls (which had grown to the point they now reached the floor after merging with Ruby) meant that leaving the office would be a struggle. And while that would be something easily solved by the remote, her bosses office was designed to give a near-perfect view of the club between it’s glass walls, floors, and ceilings, as well as the array of monitors showing areas that were in any blind spots. The only places Amber had no vision on were most of the private rooms on the floors above for obvious reasons, though a few of them had cameras for any exhibitionists willing to sign a waver so their “private” time could be broadcast to not just Ruby’s office, but several other TV’s around the club.<br />
<br />
Amber’s eyes scanned across the club, taking in all the many different furs mingling about the dance floor, bar, strip club, and brothel floors. Eventually her eyes fell upon a group making their way towards one of the private rooms. <br />
<br />
Two of Amber’s co-workers—a cow-morph with the same genital configuration as Amber outside of her udder and a vixen with three breasts in a single row across her chest—were draped over the arms of a tall hyena with two massive breasts on their chest and a pair of equally large breast-balls attached to a cock that almost touched the floor. <br />
<br />
Amber, wanting to change all three furs before they entered their room—and thus left the range of the remote—immediately got to work. First was the cow-morph, Amber’s co-worker Emmy. A template from the ones Ruby had saved was used to change Emmy’s legs into a full tauric body, her cock and udder now positioned between her rearmost legs. The free space now opened on her upper body was quickly filled by copying her two pairs of breasts into four, her chest and belly now crowded with milky titflesh. Amber then merged Emmy’s udder and cock to turn them into a single udder with massive cocks in place of its teats.<br />
<br />
For Amber’s other co-worker, the vixen named Krys, Amber took her head and merged it with her pussy, the vulpine muzzle now sticking out from between Krys’s legs. To the space between her shoulder Amber copied a cock from another patron, it’s balls hanging over the trio of breasts as the shaft stood erect. This shaft by itself was then copied to replace each of her nipples as well. For a final flair, Amber then deleted the vixen’s arms to enhance her new forms helplessness.<br />
<br />
For the Hyena, of whom Amber knew not the name nor gender of, she started by copying a form from another template to turn her into a feral hyena. Their seven foot frame now the shoulder height on a massive quadrupedal body, their breast, breast-balls, and cock now hanging below their horizontally aligned form. Each of these features were then duplicated, giving them eight total breasts—four on her chests and four between her rear legs—and two cocks, which Amber quickly grew so they reached through their double cleavage.<br />
<br />
The trio of transformed furs entered their room, sure to enjoy their time together, as Amber moved on to another part of the bar. One hand was on the remote while another rubbed up and down Ruby’s body, the cock-woman using her own tentacle-cocks to assist.<br />
<br />
Amber’s next target was the bar down on the first floor. She didn’t know either of the bartenders working at the moment—a snake ‘fur’ hermaphrodite with six breasts, and a vagina-mouthed deer fur with breasts in place of her butt cheeks—but they seemed to be a bit overwhelmed at the moment by all the newly made furs coming in, as the bar was close to the entrance. <br />
<br />
Hoping to take a bit of the pressure off of them, Amber gave them both six arms so they could multitask more effectively. That worked somewhat, but extra arms could only go so far so Amber decided to go a bit more extreme. <br />
<br />
First, the snake got her legs merged with their tail to turn her into a lamia. This was to make it easier to manage the five upper bodies she was then given These bodies split off just below where her hips were, meaning her genitals were also duplicated to each body. All five of her upper bodies were then copied to the tip of her tail, giving her ten total upper bodies each with six-arms, six breasts, and a foot-long cock and apple-sized balls.<br />
<br />
With her serpentine co-worker now doing ten times as much work, the deer now had little to do—at least that’s how it seemed to Amber. Rather then multiply her to match the snake’s efficiency, Amber chose to give her a while new role instead. First she grew her breasts (the pairs on her chest and butt both) to beach-ball size, more pairs of breasts were then copied all over her torso—front back and sides. When Amber reached the practical limit on breasts, which was four “rings” of six breasts—three on the front and back and one on each side plus her butt-breasts—around the torso, she began copying various cocktail ingredients onto each individual breasts.<br />
<br />
Soon the deer was a walking alcohol dispenser, each of her twenty-six breasts lactating a different drink. Her excessive boobage left her six arms squeezed between her side-tits, meaning she couldn&#39;t use them for much and relied on her snake co-worker to “milk” her breasts. Every once in a while one of the snake’s bodies would face-fuck the deer, feeding her a load of cum that was used to refill her stores.<br />
<br />
Watching the people she changed instantly adapt to their new roles and forms was an insane power-trip to Amber, and Ruby was cleanly enjoying the show as well as it wasn’t long before they came again. The glass floor was now coated completely in cum, making it hard to see what was going on below. Amber wondered if this was a sign it was time to get moving and patrol the club with Ruby or if she should stay here and change the people she could still see.</p>
