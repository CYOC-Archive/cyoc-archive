<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dolly woke up and figured out where John went pretty quickly. She wasn&#39;t in the bathroom, with Cindy, anywhere downstairs... John was woken up pretty abruptly. Dolly was furious in a way, both angry that John&#39;s private space had been violated by some intruder... and wanting to be a better sister and not wanting to scare away or wedge a divide between Dolly and her Jill. Cindy  intervened with some breakfast and took them all to the outlets. <br />
In a shop Cindy said &quot;We&#39;re a happy family buying clothes. Right Dolly?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes, mom...&quot; <br />
Cindy smiled and said &quot;Let&#39;s see, alright Jane why not go look for something to use for a uniform? We&#39;ll grab a few cute outfits for you to wear outside of school. Trust us.&quot; she said giving a wink to John. What that wink meant John wasn&#39;t sure and she was filled with a sense of dread. <br />
Dolly asked &quot;Don&#39;t you think she&#39;d rather pick out an outfit herself?&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Well I&#39;m not sure she really gets modern fashion, not sure i&#39;m the best either so I&#39;ll need your help.&quot; <br />
Dolly said &quot;Alright Jill, remember the elementary school uniform requirements?&quot; <br />
John sighed and said &quot;Yes I remember. Don&#39;t worry I should be able to pick out a uniform myself.&quot; she turned and started looking... for wherever they put the little girl stuff. <br />
Struggling and unsure John almost didn&#39;t notice when a voice behind him asked &quot;Are you ok?&quot;  <br />
John turned around and saw a fellow little girl and stammered for a second with her words and finally said &quot;Just looking for some uniforms, I&#39;m new here so-&quot;<br />
The fellow little girl got a sparkle in her eyes and said &quot;Ah, are you going to Koya Tina elementary?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; <br />
&quot;I go there too! I&#39;m Jess I can introduce you to my friends if you want an-&quot; <br />
A familiar voice called out &quot;Where&#39;d you go Jess? You know this is why mom says we need to reduce your sugar intake?&quot; and then turning a corner Kathy came into sight. &quot;Ah there you-&quot; she spotted the little John and confused said &quot;you got yourself a new friend?&quot; John had heard of Kathy&#39;s sisters, but had never met them. <br />
Jess said &quot;I was just going to show her where they keep the uniformy clothes here.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;You don&#39;t say?... Where are your parent&#39;s kid?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Off finding some other clothes while I find a uniform.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;right, I think they were that way. Jess why don&#39;t you go looking for that apron you needed?&quot; <br />
Jess a little annoyed at being separated from a potentially new friend muttered &quot;k...&quot; and went to look for a good apron. Kathy saw a uniform for John that looked like it would fit and dragged John into a changing room. <br />
Kathy asked &quot;What&#39;s going on John? Why are you still a kid?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Well apparently after I passed out and you abandoned my mother, she had to make an excuse to Yumi about who I was. Then the gods sent some papers so even my sister thinks I&#39;m adopted. So after I worked up my courage to tell the truth, another lie is just keeping me in this role... Although maybe this is better for my sister.&quot; <br />
Kathy asked &quot;But what about us John? Your friends? Kiyoshi&#39;s more nuts than ever and Martha is following him and... It just feels like I&#39;m losing all my friends to this or that.&quot; John felt a little more guilt. Right more than just his family was affected right? <br />
John grinned and said &quot;Well I can always do this right?&quot; and grew herself back up to her normal age and said &quot;So it&#39;s not like we can&#39;t have fun as teens right? Mom knows so I can sneak out with her and go out like this from time to time.&quot; <br />
Kathy smiled and said &quot;Right, I suppose I can help find some excuses so we can do stuff like this. Maybe we can even let Jess into our little secret at some point? Although we should see how that uniform fits you so... shrink down please.&quot; <br />
John shrank back down then asked &quot;Can I get some privacy please?&quot; <br />
Kathy grinned and said &quot;I dunno, you may not get how to put on some of the clothes. May need my assistance.&quot; <br />
&quot;Out!&quot; <br />
&quot;Fine, just holler if you need anything.&quot; John took off her clothes an- What was with this Uniform? So many straps an hoops... <br />
John said &quot;Kathy, I hate you!&quot;<br />
Kathy peaked in and said &quot;Ha, knew it! Let big sister Kathy help you with your clothing needs.&quot; and then showed John how the particular Uniform worked. <br />
John said &quot;There are too many little things that should be useless... although I think I get it now.&quot; <br />
Kathy giggled and said &quot;Well you look cute in that frilly thing.&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;What are the purpose of all those zippers and buttons?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;If I remember right... the idea was to make overly complex clothes with so many bits could be fun to put on... no idea why they are still in business. Still everything fit right. Nothing too loose or tight in the wrong areas?&quot;<br />
John said &quot;Kathy, I literally have no idea what is even a right area for something to be tight or loose.&quot;  <br />
Kathy chuckled then asked &quot;Well is anything uncomfortable?&quot;<br />
John said &quot;The sleeves are a little long-&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;That&#39;s fi-&quot; <br />
Cindy outside asked &quot;Jane! Where are you?!?&quot; <br />
Kathy went out of the room and said &quot;Oh hey Ms. Mavis funny meeting you here. There&#39;s this little girl I met who&#39;s just the cutest. She just needed some help putting on a uniform. Why don&#39;t you come out little miss, I think your family would like to see you in your uniform.&quot; John went outside the changing room and there was everyone. Family, Kathy, and Jess with a red apron in her hands. <br />
While waiting for John to come out they had a conversation &quot;Still what are the odds we&#39;d meet you here Kathy?&quot; Cindy asked. <br />
Kathy responded with &quot;Depend on if you believe that Chronos urban legend or not.&quot; <br />
Jess said &quot;She sounds fun, I&#39;d like to be grown up and play with you all!&quot; <br />
John came fully out just to hear Dolly say &quot;That Chronos stuff is obviously faked. So many photoshops, children used for tabloids, and the illnesses were cured by actual doctors instead of magic.&quot; <br />
Jess said &quot;She&#39;s real! There are real Priestesses like Silky and Kathy didn&#39;t you say something about that detective guy?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;I&#39;m not sure about the medical stuff, but our friend&#39;s uncle investigated a few things. A lot of things he looked at just didn&#39;t have any good explanations other than time magic.&quot; <br />
Dolly said &quot;Whatever, cute uniform Jill.&quot; The others were a little immersed in the argument to notice John, but they noticed her now. Kathy had already seen it, but Jess and Cindy could appreciate the cute Uniform. <br />
John uncertainly said &quot;Thanks...&quot;<br />
Cindy said &quot;It&#39;s Cute and baggy enough for you to grow into. It&#39;s a good choice.&quot; <br />
John sighed and said &quot;So we&#39;re getting this one?&quot; <br />
Cindy nodded and said &quot;Sure, go take it off and we&#39;ll go get it along with some other things we got for you to try on.&quot;<br />
John said &quot;Ok then... I&#39;ll take this off and get my normal clothes on...&quot;  <br />
Kathy grinned and said &quot;Yeah, simple. You can do something like taking off that uniform right?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes I can!&quot; John said... and yes she technically could. But it took awhile. Then John had to try on so many different things. To Cindy and Dolly&#39;s credit they weren&#39;t all frilly skirts, but had some simple pants and shirts. It was kinda fun. The guy in John loathed showing off her loli self in such cute outfits. Sandra even set up a play date with John and Jess while Dolly was off getting a few things for later.</p>
