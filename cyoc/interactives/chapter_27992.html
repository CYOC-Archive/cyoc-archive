<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first, Tim seemed a little stung to have been called “young” by a beautiful woman like Carrie. He wasn’t that “young.” Yeah, he was only 5’1” and 110 pounds, but that was normal for 13 year olds. He was a teenager now, not some little kid. That thought gave him an idea.<br />
<br />
“I wish I was older… and bigger too…” he said. “…and really good looking.”<br />
<br />
Tim looked at her with nervous anticipation on his face. Carrie gave him a mischievous smile, and then she used the remote to pause time for everyone but Tim and her. The sudden silence surprised Tim. He looked around to see birds frozen in mid air and people standing as still as statues.<br />
<br />
As he looked around distracted, Carrie secretly programmed Tim’s changes into the remote.<br />
<br />
“Your wish…” she said in a theatrically loud voice in order to get Tim’s attention. “…is granted.”<br />
<br />
She pushed the execute button on the remote.<br />
<br />
Tim felt a tingle pass through him, and then he quickly noticed that he was growing. He could feel himself becoming taller. His legs began to stretch out beneath him. In only a few seconds, he had grown an inch taller.<br />
<br />
“You might want to take off those shoes,” said Carrie. “They could start to get tight.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Tim quickly sat down on the ground and pulled off his shoes. When he stood up again it was clear that he had grown another inch taller. He was so excited. He wondered just how tall he would get.<br />
<br />
Then, he noticed something strange. His chest seemed to be pushing out larger in front of him. At first, he thought he was growing muscular pecs, but instead of hard muscle, what he saw were two mounds of expanding soft flesh. Then, he felt some tightness in his underwear. He looked at his butt to see it ballooning out wider and rounder.<br />
<br />
Tim looked at Carrie with worry in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening to me?” he asked.<br />
<br />
He looked even more worried when he heard that his voice actually sounded higher than it had before.<br />
<br />
“I’m just granting your wish as you said it,” She said.<br />
<br />
Tim had just grown another two inches taller to make him 5’5” tall. It was also clear that he was growing older too, but instead of growing the muscular male body he had hoped for, he seemed to be growing more feminine and curvy. Looking at his hands, Tim saw that they were becoming proportionally smaller and more delicate. Below him, his legs were becoming long and sexy, while his ass and hips had taken on womanly proportions. His underwear felt very tight on him, but his waist seemed not to have grown at all. Most significantly, from Tim’s perspective, were his expanding breasts. (As impossible as it was to believe, he couldn’t deny that that was what they were.) They pushed out against his basketball jersey, tenting it in front of him. Although Tim didn’t know cup sizes, by this point, he had a pair of B-cups on his chest. They seemed huge to him.<br />
<br />
The feminization continued. His facial features softened. His nose narrowed and became more upturned and cute. His eyelashes thickened, and his lips became fuller. Tim’s already long hair grew out longer down his back.<br />
<br />
Then, he became aware of the change in his crotch. To his horror he could clearly feel his penis shrinking away. He reached down to touch it as he felt his formerly 4” member dwindle away in his hands into seemingly nothing. Then, he could feel an opening growing as a vagina formed in its place.<br />
<br />
“No!” shouted Tim in an unmistakably female voice.<br />
<br />
The changes slowed to a halt. Tim and Carrie took a moment to look over Tim’s new female body. Tim was now a 16-year-old girl. She (since calling him “He” no longer fits) was now 5’6” tall and 130 pounds. With her curvy hourglass figure, she had a perfect cheerleader’s body. Her broad hips and round ass were perfectly balanced by a large pair of C-cup breasts. The 13-year-old boy’s basket ball uniform she wore seemed ridiculously tight on her. Seen from the side, the sides of her breasts were visible through the arm holes of the stretched out jersey. She was a perfect piece of jailbait.<br />
<br />
Tim was dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
“So,” said Carrie. “How do you like it?”<br />
<br />
Tim tried to find the words, “W-Why did you do this to me? I-I didn’t want THIS.”<br />
<br />
“But this is what you asked for,” said Carrie. She ticked off the requests in Tim’s wish on her fingers. “You wanted to be older, bigger and good looking. You are now three years older. You are bigger…”<br />
<br />
Carrie paused and let her eyes focus on Tim’s new big breasts. Tim looked down at them as well. Then, Tim reflexively touched a breast with one of her hands. It felt soft and there was a definite sexual charge as she moved her hand over it. Tim quickly pulled her hand away from it and blushed, embarrassed at feeling up her own boob. She looked at her breasts again. They didn’t seem to be just big to her. To her eyes, they were mammoth boobs.<br />
<br />
“…and,” Carrie continued. “You are, I think, by your own standards, very good looking.”<br />
<br />
She handed Tim a compact makeup mirror from her purse. Tim looked at her beautiful new feminine face in it. She touched it with her dainty hand. It was true. She was cute enough to be a model. As a boy, she would have idolized her new features. The body she had now would have been the subject of many a late night masturbation session in the past. Even now as a girl, she did find herself turned on by her looks. Carrie took back her mirror and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Well,” she said. “It looks like we are done here now. I’m sure that you’re all excited to go off and join the girls basketball team or something like that… Or, maybe you’d rather be a cheerleader now… Hmm. At the very least, you’ll want to show of your body to your buddies from school. I’m sure they would like a look at you now. Oh, and your parents will be so proud to see what a lovely young lady you are becoming.”<br />
<br />
The girl in front of Carrie stared at her in a state of shock. Tim could hardly believe what had happened to herself. She had to fix this somehow.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” said Tim.<br />
<br />
“No need to thank me,” said Carrie with mock charity while holding up a palm to her. “I’m just happy to have granted your wish… and you did bring me this drink.”<br />
<br />
She took another sip from her drink, satisfied with her work. Seeing as she was playing a genie, it was only natural for her to have twisted a wish in this way. It would be an insult to genies everywhere if she didn’t turn Tim’s wish against him (or her as it was now). <br />
<br />
She looked at Tim and said, “Now, would you be so kind as to leave me alone. I want to enjoy the park on my own.”<br />
<br />
Tim looked desperate.<br />
<br />
“Please, turn me back,” she said <br />
<br />
Carrie smiled, “Sorry, I don’t grant second wishes, and I don’t take back the ones I've granted already. Now, go away… or else.” She gave him a stern look, like she meant business.<br />
<br />
What would Tim do now?</p>
