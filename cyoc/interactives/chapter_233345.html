<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer nodded to her self in the mirror, she couldn&#39;t just go through with this, even if she escaped the curse she was certainly not ready to be a mother out of high school. First thing was first, she needed to actually get ready for school. She had an awkward time sitting on the toilet, her stomach not letting her comfortably sit to go pee, which only served as more of a reinforcement in her mind that she needed desperately to change this.<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn&#39;t care about her height, she painfully already knew she was short, but she did check her weight, stepping on the scale she saw the numbers rise, 90 lbs, if she was almost seventy pounds before, she must of had put on a lot more weight since the pregnancy. She turned around in the mirror, she could kind of see it, her hips and ass were much more pronounced, still nowhere where she used to be.<br />
<br />
Jennifer turned to walk back to her room, she saw her dresser, and started to rummage through it for clues. Her photo of her football game was gone, no shocker there. Instead, she had a photo of a ultrasound, and a picture of her next to another guy she didn&#39;t recognize. &quot;Right, Alex is still middle school now, that means I&#39;d have a different boyfriend I guess.&quot; Jennifer muttered. She wasn&#39;t a fan of the reality shifts, she already had a hard time memorizing her homework, let alone time shenanigans.<br />
<br />
Jennifer started to look through her lower drawers, trying to find something at least sensible to wear. Unfortunately it seemed her wardrobe didn&#39;t update with her body, she had no maternity clothes. Maybe they didn&#39;t even make them for people as small as her, she wondered. <br />
<br />
She chose a pair of loose fitting shorts she found, and the shirt that had the most stretch. Unfortunately they, despite her best effort, looked quite silly on her. Her belly prevented her from zipping her shorts up, leaving her panties from the front in view of anyone who looked under her belly. Even worse was her shirt, which strained against both her breasts and stomach, causing it to ride up, revealing the bottom half of her obscene belly. Her only ray of sunshine was she had found a bra, a real bra! But, she glanced to the side, that would go away come tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Jennifer hoisted herself up in her pants and grabbed her backpack, she had noticed looked a bit more run-down that she remembered. I guess preparing for a kid costs more than she thought.<br />
<br />
With a slow pace, she made it down the steps and out of the house, she couldn&#39;t walk that well, and what was worse she couldn&#39;t tell if it was due to her baby, her body, or her curse. She pushed the thought out of her mind as she waited for the bus.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the bus ride was uneventful, she could tell some of the other students were giving her the eye, she was sure she was a pariah of  the school, a pregnant freshmen. A warning to all those with teen love, and a centerpiece for advocates of condoms. <br />
<br />
She remembered her freshmen classes now at least, walking back through the familiar halls she once again ran into Sarah. She was certainly a ray of sunshine, and Jennifer was glad she was still her friend. &quot;Hey Jenni! How&#39;s the belly?&quot; Sarah playfully gave it a poke. Jennifer winced, it was certainly tender, despite how hard her stomach had become. &quot;It&#39;s fine, more focused on school for now.&quot; Jennifer deflected. The two made their way to their classes, Sarah providing much needed gossip on school life, including an interesting bit. Sarah remembered Jennifer being bullied in the cafeteria, despite Jennifer jumping around time, only she was moving through it. The world, the days, it was all still moving along like nothing was happening. Jennifer was the only unknown variable. Yesterday Sarah&#39;s friend was someone completely else, now its Jennifer again, like a train car was simply switching tracks. She hoped she was right, that meant she could swap back to normal without anything wacky happening.<br />
<br />
The school day was coming to an end, Jennifer had been pretty reserved, as she had predicted, most of the other teenagers avoided her besides the teachers, Sarah, and some other freshman she didn&#39;t quite remember well, his face blurry in her memory.<br />
<br />
Leaving the bus to head home, she gave a stink eye to a random kid on the bus, that would trigger it for sure.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s mom had prepared a dinner, a bath, even made her bed. If it wasn&#39;t for the child on the way this was one of the better nights she had this week. That night, Jennifer struggled to find a comfortable position to sleep in, she couldn&#39;t obviously sleep on her stomach, she hated sleeping on her side, and her back made her bladder feel small. She shook her head, hopefully just pure exhaustion would lull her, as she closed her eyes.</p>
