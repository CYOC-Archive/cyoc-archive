<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s hardly unknown for people and their pets to become very close after they&#39;ve both become Animalians. In fact, during the Outbreak, many people met their mates this way. Probably among the most famous in that regard were Abby and Samson as well as Anton and Marlysa. Even afterwards, when people brought in their pets, or occasionally zoo animals, for uplifting, romance will sometimes blossom and lead to conversion. If nothing else, the uplifted animals will definitely have a stronger bond with the people they knew before.<br />
<br />
Violet wasn&#39;t always Miss Juliet Renard-Argenté&#39;s &#39;lady in waiting&#39;. She had come from a family who bred horses, and some of them were very fine specimens. Her favorite was undoubtedly Blancheur. Blancheur was certainly a very beautiful horse, with a flawlessly white coat and similarly white mane and tail. He wasn&#39;t an albino as could be seen by look at his eyes. But it was astonishing how perfectly white he was. He had been Violet&#39;s favorite since he was a foal and she rode him plenty of times when he was grown. Her only regret about working for Miss Juliet was that she couldn&#39;t bring Blancheur with her.<br />
<br />
Violet sometimes wondered if she shouldn&#39;t have become a raccoon Animalian. She could have easily have become a horse, probably still keeping the purple discoloration of her failed eczema cure. But while horses were beautiful creatures and the Animalians they became considered one of the most popular and sexiest, Violet just didn&#39;t feel the right resonating within her. She may love horses, but she just couldn&#39;t see herself as a horse. Anyways, there were far too many meat dishes she was fond of for her to give up.<br />
<br />
Not long after her conversion, Violet petitioned Miss Juliet to have Blancheur uplifted. Miss Juliet gracious granted it. After all, it couldn&#39;t be an Animalian colony if the people living there were mostly female. It took a little time for Miss Juliet to go through the proper procedures for buying the horse. Violet&#39;s family probably would have given her Blancheur, but Miss Juliet insisted that she to pay for what the white stallion is worth. After all, she was depriving them of a valuable breeding stud.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
There was a disused stable on Miss Juliet&#39;s land. It was a few hundred years old and had been mostly used for housing other gentry&#39;s horses when they came to visit. Of course, with the nobility losing their influence and the rise of automobiles over horses, the stable hadn&#39;t held any horses as long as Miss Juliet could remember. It wasn&#39;t in too much disrepair to be torn down and it would doubtlessly be made into a new kind of building once the colony was started. But it seemed like an appropriate place for Blancheur to be uplifted.<br />
<br />
But Violet wasn&#39;t uplifting Blancheur alone in there. She had requested Olympe&#39;s help in turning Blancheur into an Animalian. Olympe had been rather flustered at the idea at first, but it grew on her. With an absence of local stallions, Olympe&#39;s sexual needs had been going unfulfilled. And if Blancheur was this handsome as a horse, imagine how good he&#39;ll look as an anthro.<br />
<br />
“So, how are going to do this?” asked Olympe once they were in one of the old stalls, “Do you have a particular plan?”<br />
<br />
“You’ve been de-vaccinated, right?” asked Violet.<br />
<br />
“I am now,” said Olympe. It was strange how the Animalian virus’s infectiousness could be switched off and on like that. But then again, if it couldn’t be switched off, it would seriously hamper Animalians’ interactions with humans without accidentally infecting them.<br />
<br />
“Then proceed to uplift him how you like,” said Violet.<br />
<br />
Olympe lifted an eyebrow, “However I like?”<br />
<br />
“Feel free to be as naughty as you would like,” said Violet, grinning.<br />
<br />
If Olympe didn’t know better, she’d think Violet was a bit of a voyeur. Then again, the Animalian virus tends to reawaken repressed sexual urges. Just look at what happened with Miss Juliet after she had one too many glasses. And Olympe found the idea of Violet watching turned her on a bit too.<br />
<br />
Her mind turned to the dirtiest uplifting method she could think of. She imagined herself naked and gripped one wall while Blancheur mounted her from behind. Of course, such a thing would seriously injure, if not kill, a normal woman. But Olympe was a horse Animalian, a Percheron like that. She was close in size and mass to Blancheur as he already was. She could easily take in his big, thick stallionhood as long as he didn’t bring his full weight on her. At least, not until he started to change. When his big barrel chest started to flatten out into a muscular humanoid torso. And his front hooves became hands to grope at her large, heaving breasts. And his hind legs became more suitable to standing upright so he could plow deeper into her wet marehood.<br />
<br />
A whicker from Blancheur brought Olympe out of her fantasy. She found she was growing quite wet between her legs from her dirty thoughts. And Blancheur had picked up on her arousal. This mare may be funny-looking to him, but he could tell when she wanted to rut. His thick cock was already coming out of its sheath.<br />
<br />
Olympe soon stripped herself and almost bent over for Blancheur right there. But not just yet. As tempting as that particular fantasy was, there were some practical (not to mention moral) complications with fucking a horse, even if that horse would become sapient. Anyways, there was an easier but still arousing way to uplift him. Olympe and Blancheur were about head-level, so it was pretty easy to guide Blancheur to her breast. Blancheur nuzzled the nipple, which caused some milk to start leaking out. His old nursing instinct kicked him and he latched onto her. Olympe moaned a bit. Blancheur didn’t use his teeth thankfully, but his lips and tongue created a strong vacuum effect.<br />
<br />
“I think he’ll be coming along quite nicely,” said Violet. Olympe looked over at Violet and was a little surprised to see that she had stripped too. Violet’s raccoon body may be smaller and not as muscular as Olympe’s, but she still had a sexy figure. “What? You didn’t think you were going to have all the fun with him, did you?” asked Violet.<br />
<br />
“You and him?” asked Olympe doubtfully as she adjusted her stance as Blancheur’s started to change. While Animalian women can handle penises of large sizes, horse cocks were still among the largest.<br />
<br />
“I should still get to ride him one last time,” said Violet.<br />
<br />
Olympe shrugged before gripping Blancheur’s shoulders as they started pushing out. “I just hope you can handle it,” she said.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Sometime later, Olympe and Blancheur walked out of the stable, Blancheur wearing a pair of horse-sized trousers Olympe had brought. Blancheur was carrying Violet, who wouldn&#39;t be walking for a while, at least not straight. &quot;I warned you it might be too much,&quot; said Olympe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still...worth it...&quot; said Violet, wincing from her very sore pelvis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I didn&#39;t hurt you,&quot; said Blancheur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only...in a good way...&quot; said Violet, stroking his strong arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it might be best for you to stick to someone in your size range,&quot; said Olympe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; admitted Violet, &quot;But you...take good care of him for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no particular reason why Olympe would have settle down with Blancheur. There were quite a lot of single stallions these days. Not to mention plenty of mares who&#39;d like to be Blancheur&#39;s mate. But Olympe had to admit that Blancheur had a lot of potential, even if she wasn&#39;t ready for marriage yet. &quot;I&#39;ll see to it that he gets what he wants,&quot; she promised Violet.</p>
