<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I am going to destroy that bitch Gianna!&quot; Chris said<br />
He looked at the cum covered keyboard of the Chronivac Version 4.0 system he had. He knew what he had to do. He was going to ruin Gianna&#39;s life. He planned to use Chronivac Version 4.0 to turn himself into Gianna and he was going to record multiple videos of her saying every racist and sexist thing possible on every social media platform possible to make sure everyone hated the angel Gianna Miller. He enacted his plan. He put in the commands and changed himself from Chris to Gianna Miller. He felt a burst of energy roll through him. Chris fell to the floor in agony. He first felt his skull reforming to match Gianna&#39;s skull, his short brown hair became wavy and started to roll down his back until it was a copy of Gianna&#39;s. Then Chris felt a burning pain in his abdomen that felt like someone just poured acid all over him. The stubborn belly fat he had for years was being destroyed just like that. Some of the fat was being repurposed to become a clone of Gianna&#39;s magnificent breasts and ass. His figure slimmed out to match Gianna&#39;s. His height decreased from 6&#39;2&#39;&#39; to 5&#39;7&#39;&#39;. Then the real pain happened he moaned as his henti monster cock was being ripped apart from his body falling off and becoming some type of weird dildo. His original cock and balls were now back but not for long because they quickly got sucked into her new hole. A pop could be heard as they went in. <br />
<br />
At this moment Chris&#39;s body was a carbon copy twin of Gianna&#39;s. Chris then looked at the mirror and saw his sexy goddess sister in his now baggy too big for her frame clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say goodbye to your life bitch&quot; <br />
Chris felt a weird feeling as he was about to record his videos as Gianna. He felt like her inner venomous personality was inside of him somehow. Chris then had a massive headache she was being rushed with Gianna&#39;s mind everything from when she was in kindergarten to today. Every emotion Gianna ever felt rushed through Chris at once. He groaned in pain looking to the  Chronivac Version 4.0 system  to see what happened. It turns out he hit the allow access to memories command by mistake and was now having every memory of Gianna rush him. After five minutes Chris felt better but wanted to be referred to as a she while as her sister Gianna. He learned everything about her all of the years of secret bullying, insecurities, and hidden break ups. Chris saw that while still a bitch she was an injured soul that needling healing and an attitude adjustment. She just broke into tears and when she reheard what she said earlier in her original form he just broke her heart. <br />
<br />
Without thinking Chris just ran to Gianna&#39;s room which was unlocked. She opened the door to see a crying Gianna. Chris just hugged and cried into her arms. Overlooking the fact that she was hugging a random imposter of her that just came into her room and she was definitely freaking out on the inside she found confront in herself. <br />
<br />
After about 10 mins Gianna pulled back and said <br />
&quot;Okay who the hell are you?!, I will call the cops!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sis it is me Chris look the clothes come on&quot;<br />
&quot;Prove it&quot;<br />
&quot;You made everyone believe I pissed myself in middle school and convinced everyone I was a furry in high school both happened near my birthday&quot;<br />
 &quot;Okay that proves two things&quot;<br />
&quot;Two things?&quot; Chris asked <br />
&quot;One that you are Chris, and also that I look great in anything&quot;<br />
&quot;Haha very funny&quot;<br />
&quot;Why the hell are you in body?&quot; <br />
&quot;You may want to sit down for this&quot;<br />
<br />
After about an hour <br />
&quot;So you were planning on destroying my life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes I am so sorry you can punish me however you want&quot;<br />
&quot;I am not going to punish you don&#39;t worry&quot;<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes don&#39;t worry Chris I won&#39;t besides that would be cruel.. you were punished by my memories and emotions&quot;<br />
&quot;I am sorry that I have been a shitty sister to you&quot;<br />
&quot;Its okay baby sister&quot;<br />
&quot;While your like that we are twins&quot;<br />
&quot;Fair point&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am going to change back into myself&quot;<br />
<br />
As Chris was walking off Gianna screamed <br />
&quot;Wait&quot;<br />
&quot;Chris if you want to... I just want to maybe spend the day as twins.... to see what it would be like to have another me around.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only if you want though&quot;<br />
<br />
Normally if Chris were stuck in the body of his sister Gianna he would try to change back ASAP but something in her just wanted to see what it would be like. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure why not we have the whole rest of the day... Dad usually doesn&#39;t come back until midnight we have a long time&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome... Chris while I do look nice in your clothes.... I think you would look better in mine.... just saying if you want the Gianna experience&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that sounds really cool&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked back to the bedroom <br />
<br />
&quot;My wardrobe is yours&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris looked though Gianna&#39;s selection of many.... many.... many clothes. She decided that this cute pair of red short shorts and white crop top would look great on her. She then grabbed a hair tie and but her hair in a high ponytail.  <br />
<br />
She walked out<br />
<br />
&quot;You look amazing!&quot; Gianna said to her twin <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.... I do have a perfect blueprint in front of me though&quot; Chris said <br />
<br />
Gianna blushed <br />
<br />
They then spent the rest of the day just hanging out doing things Gianna would normally do. Chris did record a video for social media but not the way he intended. It was a funny video everyone was going to think Gianna had great video editing skills as both Chris and Gianna performed a fashion show. <br />
<br />
They then decided to cook dinner together and then decided to shower. Although nothing happened between them in the shower. Lust was in their eyes, <br />
<br />
For dinner both Gianna and Chris decided to dress up a bit. Gianna wore a blue super mini dress and Chris wore a black microtube dress, Both had minimal makeup because these two goddess don&#39;t really need it. <br />
<br />
After having dinner the two were watching a movie on the couch when Chris asked a question. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gianna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sis&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really enjoyed today with you and I really enjoyed this bonding between us and I don&#39;t want it to end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want to be my twin sister cool we will think of a name in a bit&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Gianna I don&#39;t want to just be twin sisters I want to be you Gianna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want to take over my life!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. God NO!, I want for both of us to be able Gianna Miller&quot;<br />
<br />
A faint moan could be heard from the last part of that sententance<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your telling me that you didn&#39;t have any lust in that shower don&#39;t lie I have access to your mind&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but how would we even be able to do that&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The very thing that allowed this in the first place&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure because that is very drastic&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am sure think about how much better it will be with both of us being Gianna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Chris?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry we can preserve the parts about our past relationship and it will live with us forever, hell we could just make a new Chris for us&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t need to do that&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris....... or rather Gianna lets make the final touches and make two of us&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!!!!&quot; Chris or in about a two minutes Gianna said <br />
<br />
Chris went back to her room and finished the deed making sure to keep their memoires about today intact. <br />
<br />
Gianna sat at Chris&#39;s desk watching as room morphed around her. The room slowly turned into an additional study for her dad Jim. Memories of Gianna being roommates with her sister/clone flooding her mind. The only two thing that remained the same in the room where the Chronivac Version 4.0 and the henti dildo that belonged to Chris. <br />
<br />
Gianna had a surprise for herself. <br />
<br />
Coming down the stairs she looked at herself knowing there would now be two of her. She held the dildo behind her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t hide that dildo from me&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gianna on the couch accessed the shared memory she had with the new Gianna. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I think you know what we are going to do&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do I am you and it will be hot our mind is amazing afterall&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your dress off slut&quot; Tube dress Gianna ordered<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes me&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Giannas ripped off thier dresses and began to have sex with each other. They started fingering each other hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;God I taste good&quot; They said <br />
<br />
They then eat each others pussies out and just collapsed on the floor<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a break!&quot; They both said <br />
<br />
They then spent five minutes just enjoying each others comapny<br />
<br />
Then the used the henti dildo from Chris (his final gift to them a great brother)<br />
<br />
They got fucked in their asses by the two skinny cocks and both sucked on the fat one together<br />
<br />
Finally tired<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Gianna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Gianna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is just perfect two of us is way better than one&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked at the dildo <br />
<br />
&quot;Most importantly thank you Chris no of this would have happened without you. You will be missed big brother!&quot; They both shed some tears and then kissed.</p>
