<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claudia Harris and Mika Harris looked at the paper again to determine that the address was correct and they did double and triple takes on it. The building looked like a small Japanese castle, but on the front of it, the sign clearly read &quot;The Sleeping Kitsune&quot; with &#39;love hotel&#39; written at the bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika, are you sure that this is the place Shizen wanted us to go to that she said would be a good time for ourselves?&quot; Claudia asked her wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so, I don&#39;t know, she just handed us this note and then gave me this envelope and told me not to open it until we were inside and talked to the receptionist.&quot; Mika said as they went inside still wearing the kimonos they had been given the night of the celebration.<br />
<br />
Inside they went up to the young woman at the receptionist, who was a yellow tigress woman who looked bored while reading a book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem.&quot; Mika said clearing her throat while the tigress woman looked zoned out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Claudia said slamming her hand down on the counter of the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, welcome to &#39;The Sleeping Kitsune&#39; where your night of passion is guaranteed.&quot; The tigress woman said in a tone like she was used to it before taking out a party horn and blowing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi, we&#39;re here because my mother.....well I mean she&#39;s sort of my mother, I fused with my.....let&#39;s just say she&#39;s my mother and get this out of the way. Lady Shizen sent us here for some kind of surprise.&quot; Mika explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re the two I was expecting. I didn&#39;t know you two were human though, I thought you&#39;d be anthros.&quot; The receptionist lady commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can change into anthros, see...&quot; Mika said as she shifted into her jade kitsune form with her five tails while Claudia shifted into her red and black-striped fur anthro flame tigress form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am, do you mind turning off your flames? I like my flame ability too, but you don&#39;t see me showing it off.&quot; The receptionist lady said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a flame tigress too?&quot; Claudia asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah? Didn&#39;t your parents ever tell you once in every generation there&#39;s a tiger or tigress that has flame abilities, see?&quot; The receptionist woman said as she focused and made her body go into flames before turning the ability off.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;re flame powers?&quot; The receptionist asked motioning for her to turn them off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, sorry, I&#39;m just not too used to this form. Let me just concentrate here....&quot; Claudia said as focused on turning off the flames on her body making it so she was just a muscular anthro tigress.&quot;Oh my god, why didn&#39;t I find out about this before?!&quot; Claudia rhetorically asked. Mika didn&#39;t say it, but heart was beating loudly seeing her muscular lovely wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right (ahem) so anyway, how much do we uh....pay you for our stay?&quot; Mika asked still a little unsure about this.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t, Lady Shizen paid for your entire stay.&quot; The receptionist woman replied. &quot;Oh, and she also left a message saying you may open your letter now.&quot; The woman said as Mika and Claudia opened the letter from Shizen.<br />
<br />
&#39;Dear Claudia and Mika, I know you both have had difficult times in the past and were worried about the children while they were at war and Aaron was away, so I thought I&#39;d make it up to you both by giving you a full night stay at this hotel. Mika, I see you as a wonderful daughter, just as your human mother did. Claudia, you&#39;ve helped raise my grandchildren tall and strong just like you and my daughter is lucky to have you. This was actually where Tatsu and I first stayed years ago for our honeymoon, it&#39;s one of the oldest hotels in the realm. Enjoy your stay here at the hotel, your loving mother, Shizen.&#39; Shizen&#39;s note read.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we&#39;ll take our room key now.&quot; Mika said as the receptionist handed her the key to what looked to be the second floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be nice seeing all these happy couples come in.&quot; Claudia commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had five boyfriends, how do you think I feel?&quot; The receptionist said as she tossed confetti at the two of them and blew her party horn again. &quot;Enjoy your stay, I&#39;m getting back to my reading.&quot; The receptionist said as she sat back down to read her book. The girls didn&#39;t quite make out the title, but they saw a picture on the back of author Marisa MacGregor.<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia now made their way to an elevator and pressed the button to go to the second floor. As they passed by a few doors, they heard a few noises coming from some of the other rooms, but said nothing. They opened the door to see their room was decorated in a pinkish red color with their bed in the shape of a heart and there was a bouquet of flowers on the nightstand next to the bed. They checked the bathroom to see that it was also decorated with red colors with the toilet seat having a pink bell flower lid cover. Mika locked the room door behind just to be sure no one might accidentally come in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....wow, this is....uh....romantic?&quot; Claudia wasn&#39;t sure what else to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Romantic, yes, it is.&quot; Mika said blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, uh...what do you want to do? I can&#39;t even remember the last time we had time to enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids.&quot; Claudia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t....I don&#39;t really know.&quot; Mika shrugged.<br />
<br />
Claudia looked at the jade kitsune before her and suddenly had an idea as Mika gave her a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that look, what are you up to?&quot; Mika asked her wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we play a little game of pretend? You pretend like you&#39;ve lived here in the kitsune realm all your life and been raised by Tatsu and Shizen and have your siblings and then I act like the romantic interest coming into your life.&quot; Claudia suggested.<br />
<br />
Mika giggled at the suggestion at her wife, but liked the idea of playing pretend and falling in love all over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what might make it even more fun?&quot; Mika suggested as she now used her magic ring powers and regressed the two of them physically into teenagers.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, now it&#39;ll feel like we&#39;re doing it all over again.&quot; Mika said as she went over to the door and prepared herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;La, la, la, here I am, young Mika, daughter of my parents, the mighty Tatsu and lovely Lady Shizen walking along for a stroll.&quot; Mika described painting an image for Claudia to use.<br />
<br />
Claudia now came along and bumped into her making her fall onto the floor, as did Claudia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t see you there. See I was on my way to help out at my family&#39;s shop and I didn&#39;t notice....how....beautiful you are.&quot; Claudia said making up the story as best as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I bet you say that to all the lovely maidens in this realm, that kind of talk won&#39;t work on me, I assure you.&quot; Mika said acting like a princess and not paying attention to Claudia&#39;s comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, really, I do want to apologize. Please, tell me your name and I&#39;ll apologize to you properly, it&#39;s what my mom tells me to do.&quot; Claudia said holding out her hand to which Mika didn&#39;t take.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Mika.....uh....honey, do you think I should use a last name or just a title?&quot; Mika asked breaking character.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say that you&#39;re the daughter of Tatsu and Shizen.&quot; Claudia suggested as Mika nodded and cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I happened to be Mika, the daughter of the mighty Lord Tatsu and beautiful Lady Shizen.&quot; Mika proclaimed as Claudia quickly bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, please forgive my ignorance. I should have known that a young and beautiful vixen dressed in the most ravishing of kimonos could be none other than you. I have seen you only at a glance before, but now I can admire your lovely form close up, and may I say, you are even more picturesque in person than you are from afar.&quot; Claudia commented holding her hands as Mika gave a loving sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika, honey, you&#39;re breaking character here.&quot; Claudia said as Mika composed herself again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, let me think, uh....oh! Oh no, here comes my brother Fukushu, and he tells you that you mustn&#39;t touch his precious little sister because I am a fair flower and cannot be so easily swayed, nor seduced by a seductress tigress like yourself!&quot; Mika says putting her hand on her head while holding out her other hand towards Claudia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now you&#39;re going a little bit too dramatic here.&quot; Claudia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m trying to make it dramatic.&quot; Mika whispered. &quot;Now, my brother Fukushu is walking away and you are clearly terrified by his warning of staying away from me. But, I do feel a little intrigued by you. So I go to my sister, Kiko, and ask her to distract our brother while I go off and go meet you in secret. We meet at a lovely tea shop in town, and from there.....I think you should continue from here.&quot; Mika suggested as she motioned for Claudia to come sit down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let me think. So, I meet up with you in secret and we talk about our hopes and dreams. You tell me you want to work at your aunt&#39;s fashion business, er, what does Kiko do again?&quot; Claudia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just pretend she runs a fashion business and leave it at that.&quot; Mika suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. You tell me you want to work at your aunt&#39;s fashion business and although I have my own dreams, I decide that I&#39;ll probably do boring work at the clerk&#39;s office.&quot; Claudia said as Mika giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the best in the business to me.&quot; Mika complimented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh, but here comes Fukushu, but this time he&#39;s not alone as Kiko, Takeo, and Chisai are with him.&quot; Claudia imagined for the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so what do they say?&quot; Mika now asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....Fukushu says he&#39;s talked with his siblings and that they convinced him that his little sister is in love and that he can&#39;t change that or who his sister loves. So he will permit us to date, so long as we&#39;re faithful to each other and everything. Now here&#39;s the part where we have our dramatic and passionate kiss in the entire tea shop as they clap for us.&quot; Claudia said as the two of them got up and embraced in a passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so then what happens?&quot; Mika asked now blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh....a bunch of magic shenanigans to complicated to get into here. But the point is, we make it through together and eventually, I propose to you and you say &#39;yes&#39; and I see you dressed in the most beautiful bride&#39;s dress.&quot; Claudia said as she now aged the two of them up and changed Mika&#39;s kimono into a bride&#39;s dress. Mika looked over the dress and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful, but you know, they wear something different in Japan.&quot; Mika said as she now used her magic to change her bride&#39;s dress into a white shiromuku with the outer robe, the uchikake, which was brightly colored.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I look? Are you okay with this?&quot; The green kitsune blushed as Claudia now wore a similar dress to her beloved wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t love you anymore than I do now.&quot; Claudia said as the two of them took each other&#39;s hands and kissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, here we are back in our honeymoon suite. What do you want to do?&quot; Claudia asked as Mika thought for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know, but it&#39;s a surprise, go into the bathroom and don&#39;t come out until I say so.&quot; Mika suggested as Claudia was a little unsure, but went into the bathroom anyways.<br />
<br />
While she was in there, she looked at the young tigress form before her. She still couldn&#39;t believe how little she had used this form before, she was strong, she was beautiful, she certainly could&#39;ve relied on this strong body when she was doing yard work. She thought about all the missed opportunities for her to work outside like this and have her wife looking at her lovingly. Of course, it probably would have grossed the kids out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia, you can come out now.&quot; Mika called out to her.<br />
<br />
Claudia opened the door to see wife sitting there on the rotating heart shaped bed naked with her perfect breasts showing, and exposing her vagina there before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s almost like our honeymoon all those years ago, now take me mighty tigress.&quot; Mika said seductively as Claudia smiled walking over to her wife as she took off her own dress and tossed it to the floor as she now grasped Mika gently and the two of them touched the spots the two knew would get a rise out of the other one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh, yes, do you want children? Tell me you want children.&quot; Claudia asked her wife who was almost lost in exploring her wife&#39;s body as the two lay there on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES! I SAY IT LOUD AND PROUD TO WHATEVER GODS UP THERE, CLAUDIA HARRIS, I WANT YOUR BABIES!&quot; Mika shouted as she moaned between feeling Claudia&#39;s fingers on her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do too my love, I do too. How many, how many do you want?&quot; Claudia said kissing her wife&#39;s neck as Mika felt Claudia&#39;s tigress back and her fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four, four perfect little babies running around and they&#39;re all ours, as I&#39;m yours right now! TAKE ME! CLAUDIA HARRIS TAKE ME, I&#39;M ALL YOURS!&quot; Mika shouted and made a fox mating call.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I&#39;m yours Mika, as I....AM....YOURS!!!!&quot; Claudia shouted making a tiger mating call.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, the beautiful room they had stayed in was a mess now with both of their hair messy, Claudia laid on the bed while Mika lay on top of Claudia&#39;s chest both of them back to their own normal ages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think anyone else heard us?&quot; Mika jokingly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope the neighborhood heard us.&quot; Claudia joked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever gone that far with our sex drives.&quot; Mika commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be our animal urges. My god, how did I ever get so lucky to have you in my life?&quot; Claudia asked stroking her wife&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. But I have you, and we have four beautiful babies in our lives with us. Kari, Aaron, Haley, Mason, and we love them all with all our heart and soul.&quot; Mika sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to use magic to make a fifth child?&quot; Claudia jokingly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, four is a nice round number and we&#39;re sticking with it.&quot; Mika said booping her wife on the nose. Mika now curled herself up against Claudia with her tails lapping hers and Claudia&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re not exactly one, but you are a beautiful princess in my eyes.&quot; Claudia said kissing her on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong kissing spot.&quot; Mika said as she directed the beautiful tigress&#39;s mouth to hers.<br />
<br />
The two lovers now lay there and slept wrapped in each other&#39;s arms and furry bodies. It was one of the most exciting and romantic times in their married life.</p>
