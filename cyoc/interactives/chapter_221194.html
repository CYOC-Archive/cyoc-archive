<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared didn´t wait long to start his plans. “Now, let´s get this started. All of you will be frozen in place and silent, only able to answer my questions for now, if I have any.” Turning to Thomas and Dean, he asked: “If you two had to choose between Jeff and Todd, who would you chose?”<br />
Dean looked confused at the question. Why choose? They were best friends, it was unlikely that they would split, and if it was about a small conflict, he would need to know what this was about.<br />
Thomas, on the other hand, quickly got what Jared meant. He, alongside Todd knew that Jeff was gay. And if you think of it that way. “I would choose Todd over Jeff.” He said.<br />
Jeff, who had heard the similarity between this question and the one asked to Chris before, had an idea what would follow. But why Todd and himself? What exactly had Jared planned?<br />
Surprised his friend could chose, Dean asked himself what criteria had Thomas used to choose Todd. But he answered: “I´m unsure who I would choose. But if you want to team us, I will go to Jeff then.”<br />
Jared smirked at them. “Okay, thanks.” That was the only question he had to ask them, as the other´s changes he had already decided. With his smirk widening, he decided to start with Todd, as his was the simplest and smallest change between them.<br />
“Todd, I admire your loyalty towards Jeff, but I think it would be better elsewhere. You will regress into a ten-year-old boy like me, and instead of Jeff, I will be your best friend who you are loyal to. You will never question my choices.” Jared said, his smirk turning into a full grin.<br />
Jeff looked shocked. His brother was robbing him his best friend to be his own? Well, at least he didn´t end up a baby like Jeremy, or worse, like Chris had.<br />
While the other five guests looked confused, thinking this was impossible, a shudder went through Todd as an indicator his changes would start. He hit his puberty in reverse as he quickly shrunk smaller and younger before their eyes, his clothes slipping down his diminishing body. As Todd has been a big sixteen-year-old, but hit his growth spurt at thirteen, he quickly lost nearly sixty centimeters of height, ending up around 1,2 meters, which was a few centimeters smaller than Jared was. His features had become more childish, slightly rounder looking. He had only become slightly more athletic when he was twelve, so his small form was also chubby.<br />
Little Todd looked shocked down at himself, his old black shirt now looking like a gown on him. And it wasn´t much that held it up by his shoulders anymore. “What the fuck is this?” he screamed in his now much younger voice.<br />
Before either of the others could say anything, not that they could as they were still silenced, Jared answered smiling: “What do you mean, Todd? You are yourself, as I didn´t change you in any way. You simply tried on a shirt from my brother, that you found in his wardrobe and looked good, right? Just a normal ten-year-old boy, maybe a bit smarter than ordinary.”<br />
Todd had looked up at him, and just as Jared finished, Todd´s eyes glazed over for a second, as his mind was rewritten to fit that command. He was never questioning his best friend on anything. Memories changed, making him Jared´s best friend since kindergarten, while Jeff was the “mean, older” brother, only Jeremy was worse. As Todd blinked, he smiled up at his friend. “Do you think such a shirt will fit me when I get older, Jared?”<br />
While the other´s gaped at what used to be their friend, Jared answered: “I´m sure of it. Everyone in your family is tall, you just have to wait a bit longer.” <br />
Todd nodded happily at that, and was about to remove the shirt when he realized another problem. He looked around, but found nothing. “Uhm, Jared? Have you hidden my clothes as a joke? Or has your brother done so, again?”<br />
Jared grinned. “It needed to be washed, and Jeff will bring it as soon as it´s finished drying. A bit confused today, are you? Don´t worry, nobody in the house will have a problem with you being naked. You can either keep that shirt on, or go naked. I won´t mind.”<br />
Todd thought about it for a few seconds, shrugged and took the shirt off, throwing it down. The naked ten-year-old, made a few steps and sat down in Jared´s second chair. Whenever Jared had needed help with his homework, his helper could sit beside him on it. But it also was great for having a friend sitting next to him.<br />
Jared had examined his now best friend´s naked body with a smile, and, as if to ease him a bit, stood up and quickly removed his own clothes, throwing them beside his desk before sitting back just as naked as Todd. He mumbled for Todd to fall asleep for a few minutes until he would wake him.<br />
While the others looked still shocked for Todd, as well as Jared simply stripping, Jeff, without much thought from his body, quickly gathered Jared´s and Todd´s discarded clothes and brought them into the laundry bin, like he had done before. Mentally, Jeff was cursing Jared, something he was now unable to do aloud, for doing this to Todd. While Jeff saw himself as a slave, Todd was now like a mindless minion, a drone, believing everything Jared said as truth. So much for being his “best” friend.</p>
