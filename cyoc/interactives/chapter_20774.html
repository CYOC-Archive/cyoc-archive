<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex looks at the cigar booth in front of him grabbing as many as he can hold and shoving others in to his pockets. He smoked for the first time a few weeks ago and he knew it made him look cool. He loved the way he felt when he smoked, so mature, and so good, better than caffeine which is about all he ever could manage to get his hands on.<br />
<br />
This island was a paradise with unlimited smokes, candy and junk food everywhere. He was in heaven and the new friends he had made were great, they had spent the whole day break windows at The Rough House before they noticed the cigar shop next to the Merry Go Round.<br />
<br />
Alex didnt even notice the thick ropy tail he had swinging behind him, he was numb to the world smoking his third cigar. His friend Pete had huge pointy ears but Alex assumed it was a hat or some novelty he had grabbed from one of the many unattended gift carts strewn around the midway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey gimme one of those black ones. They say cherry on em. Thats gotta be good.&quot; Alex said reaching for a cigar.<br />
<br />
SPLAT!<br />
<br />
Something cold and gooey hit him on top of the head, hard, and immediately began to run down his face. His yell of surprise and then outrage and being hit with something attracted the laughter of his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross!&quot; he said moving his hands up to his hair and feeling the thick goop like hair gel squish in his fingers. &quot;What the hell is this crap?&quot; he splayed his fingers in front of him to observe the slime and determine what it was. There was way too much to be bird crap, and it wasnt the right color. Kind of brown and clearish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude that was awesome! hahahahaha haaaaW!&quot; Pete laughed and brayed out loud at the end of it like the jack ass he was becoming. Nobody paid him any mind though as a tail ripped the back of his pants and slowly snaked its way to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... its all over my hands and in my hair. Gross. I think its on my face.&quot; Alex wiped his hands on his jeans and then smeared the sludge on his face with the edge of his other hand trying to remove it. &quot;It kinda tingles a little. Like jellyfish or something... I wonder if somebody threw a dead jellyfish at me.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He began to change as soon as he finished his sentance. His hands,already slick with goo became shinier as they gently began to swell. Slowly at first so he almost didnt notice and then faster as they turned to rubbery latex and inflated. His fingers merged together and his thumbs went stiff and inflated. His hands looked more like mittens than hands and they were becoming difficult to move as they slowly turned translucent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... guys what the hell. Look at my hands!&quot; his friends stopped laughing and gaped at Alex's shiny balloon hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah. What the heck is the matter with you dude?&quot; Pete leaned in close to inspect his friends transformation. Alexs hands were darkening, turning black grey like a black balloon filled with air seeming lighter in color as light passes through it. &quot;It looks like -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah my head!&quot; Alex interrupted him bringing his hands to the sides of head as if in pain. &quot;It feels like its gonna explode.&quot;<br />
<br />
His hair, already slick with the slime that had fallen on him, looked different now. It was smoother, like it was wet and slicked backward. Alexes hands moved over it and squeaked as rubber met rubber, the wetness of the slime lubricating it. &quot;Uh... this is fucked up. My hair... may hanmms... mmm! mmmummh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked up, eyes wide in shock. He couldnt open his mouth. The slime on his face had sunken in to his skin and was changing him. His eyes became dull and uniform in color, a dark black grey. Alex pawed at his face with his balloon hands trying to move his lips apart but his skin was changing too quickly and his mouth and nose were sealed shut. His ears flattened to his skull as did his nose, and slowly his face inflated a little, becoming rounded and smooth. Alex's features were rendered in round balloon latex as his hands moved across them squeaking and popping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man. This is fucked. This is so fucked! What is happening to him?&quot; one of the guys with a cigar was panicked and turning, he ran in to the midway fleeing in terror.<br />
<br />
Alex doubled over making a muffled grunt sound. The spot on his jeans where he had wiped the slime was gone, it had soaked through to his skin. With a cold realization Pete saw that it was right over his new friends crotch and Alex was pawing at his pants with his rubbery hands trying to get them off. Pete could see them getting tighter, no, his friend was growing, not growing but inflating. He hurriedly unbuckled Alex's belt and unzipped his jeans pulling them to the ground, underwear and all, and then backed away at what he saw.<br />
<br />
His friends crotch was smooth and black, shiny in the light of the carnival. Alex's dick was smooth and round protruding at him as it inflated its new black balloon form. The blackness spread quickly from Alex's crotch down his legs causing them to change too, become more rounded and shiny.<br />
<br />
Alex pawed at his dick making squeak sounds and grunting trying to make words. His eyes were emotionless, rubber, but they were fixed on Pete. Slowly alex managed to grab the bottom of his shirt and pull it up over his head with a loud pop as it slid over his balloon head. His chest was changed now and his arms were darkening, becoming rounded and inflated.<br />
<br />
In a few more seconds it was over. Before his very eyes Pete's friend had become a balloon man, anatomically correct and barely able to move, but somehow he was still moving.</p>
