<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan stares at the green vial for a bit, if this is going to devolve into wild sex, then he&#39;s tempted to make another orc. He has always dreamed of loving a fantasy creature like that, but he also wants to know what the rest of these vials do. He gets the coffee machine going, should take a minute before it goes off, giving him plenty of time for his plan. Nathan getting the white vial and opening it. Putting only a drop in his own mouth and walking over to Travis. This is a dumb idea, if he accidently swallows then he has just transformed himself into who knows what. But his cock throbs and his mind is made up, this is how he is going to get Travis on his side. The janitor laying on his back, taking up the entire couch as Nathan climbs on top of him. Crawling up his sturdy body, bringing his lips against the other mans, and giving him a long kiss. Transferring the liquid from his mouth to Travis&#39;s, getting interrupted by the buzz of the coffee machine stopping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want me to get it, love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ll only be a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan gets off the janitor&#39;s chest. Making his way to the coffee cup and taking a sip. Discreetly spitting it out into the sink, hoping it gets rid of whatever residue might be left from the vial. Washing his mouth clean, emptying whatever remains in the cup, and feeling a tingling sensation on his tongue. Spreading down to his chest as Nathan starts to sweat, muscles aching, and a moan being suppressed from the changing working. This was a mistake, but this also feels so good.<br />
<br />
Nathan turns around to see that Travis is just as hot and bothered. The janitor on his feet, grabbing at the opening of his shirt and tearing it in half. Showcasing his heavy torso that only gets heavier. The thin lining of hairs expanding in all directions, creating a short fuzz that helps bring out his ridiculous physique. Six pack becoming eight pack becoming twelve pack. Pecs swelling further, nipples getting thicker and harder. His arms getting thicker, while his hands get larger. Growing to giant proportions. Travis starts panting, eying Nathan, and speaking in his unchanged voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your turn. Show your strength!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like Nathan just watched a lesson. Mimicking the janitor as he tears apart his own shirt. His thin and nerdy self-rising to new heights. Becoming more like the man Travis is, or rather, was. The explosive growth does not reach the same heights as it did for Travis. Instead, Nathan&#39;s body shows gains as if he has spent years in the gym. Growing tight and strong, having that same stretch of hairs lining his chest, and reaching out to the back of his arms. Six pack settling in, hands gaining that odd proportion, as the two men watch each other once more. Waiting for anything further, Travis&#39;s forehead pressing forward slightly, chin squaring. While Nathan only feels his chin square, and a bit of scratchy hairs press out of his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lower half next. Watch, and follow me, tribemate.&quot; <br />
<br />
Travis rolls his shoulders, cracks his knuckles, and tears his pants to shreds. His thighs like a boulder, large yet firm. Tight with countless visible muscles and veins underneath. His cock not as big as Nathan&#39;s orcish manager, but a solid 12 inches with the foreskin having regrown, perfectly fitting in the janitors oversized hand. Travis only giving it a single stroke, then stopping. Nathan getting a strange sense of unity within him, as he follows his mentor. Shredding his clothing, remaining smaller than this primal human, but still having gains far past what he had earlier. His 9 and a half inch cock fitting perfectly in his hand. Pubes having grown out to match the rug of hairs on his chest.<br />
<br />
Now complete, the two men start to circle each other. It&#39;s a challenge, a fight for the top. An instinct they follow as they put their new spears to the test, staying low to the ground, arms ready to pounce, and Travis first to act. Grabbing Nathan in an instant, flipping him onto the hard tiled floor, and piercing into his muscular ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too slow, Nathan. I need to take you on more hunts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being railed by the primitive man doesn&#39;t hurt at all. Just creating a buzz of pleasure that radiates through Nathan. Rising with each heavy thrust from his tribemate and ending when the victor deposits his load in the loser. Emptying himself out in his weaker kin, then helping him get back to his feet. Nathan beyond his own limits, in need for relief as Travis starts to reorganize his supplies. Nathan trying his best to get off, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be working. He&#39;s on the edge, but he can&#39;t get over it. Travis rests his arms on the kitchen bench, watching Nathan, laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strong men like us need a good hole. Find a monster, ask around the office, whatever you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rather than fight it, Nathan quickly accepts these new facts. That need still in him, but able to be starved off for now. He&#39;s thankful that at the very least he doesn&#39;t seem any different mentally. At least besides a few new instincts, a love for hunting, and this inability to climax. He looks over to the ripped and primitive Travis, the new man who has only gotten stronger. Body barely able to fit through a doors frame, looking more a man than Hern&#39;ry, at least in most aspects. Though his general proportions have devolved, hands and head bigger. Adjusted to a slightly squatted stance. Nathan looks over himself, and is thankful he didn&#39;t seem to reach the same heights. His hands are noticeably bigger, but looking at the windows reflection, his head is unchanged. Besides the general harder features and scruff on his chin. Though looking at the new Travis gives him an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tribemate, can you do something for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you? Anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, good. Here.&quot;<br />
<br />
He goes back to the suitcase, getting out the white vial and handing it over. He doesn&#39;t need to do all of the dirty work himself, maybe his new friend can expand the tribe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever drinks this will become a new tribemate. They only need a drop, and I need you to give it to every janitor we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy! Our tribe will be mighty after today!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That it will! Go with pride, Travis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis flexes and exits the kitchen. Leaving Nathan to ponder what to do next. He feels good, strong, and in need of relief. Maybe he could make some more monsters, or see his boss, or do his actual job. Though this could be a slippery slope, and he pulls out his phone and contemplates sending Veronica a message. Maybe it might be good to know how to reverse this before it gets too bad.</p>
