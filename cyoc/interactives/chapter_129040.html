<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There is no denying the truth of it: your beautiful, blue lover, Dizzy-tail, was sucking another drake&#39;s dick for no other reason except his love for you. You can&#39;t help but trust him. Still...<br />
<br />
You turn to look at Blunt-snout, and you wrinkle your nose as you ponder what you are going to say...call him a filthy homewrecker? But how could he be with nothing wrecked. Even covered in blood-drooling swipes left by your own claws, Dizzy-tail&#39;s love for you is stronger than ever, even though you can&#39;t possibly comprehend how someone as perfect as him could ever love you, a bagful of shortcomings.<br />
<br />
However, you just don&#39;t have any context for this...this sex between friends concept. Even with the deep love that remains in Dizzy-tail and the mere hurt frustration you see in Blunt-snout, this is too new to you. You don&#39;t know what this is. Hell, until this moment, you never even really believed it was a real thing, and you had just assumed that people that ever had sex without romantic love in the mix just were not capable of love or any real depth of feeling at all. You had always envisioned them as soulless and corrupt, vapid of either morals or intellect.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you&#39;re becoming corrupted as you start seriously thinking about this. You&#39;re not sure. Maybe sometimes it can be a good thing to become corrupted if the virtue itself is cancerous? Or maybe a perceived virtue can be...like a false idol? Corrupting a false virtue?<br />
<br />
You compose your thoughts, and--after mentally taking a breath--you start down the path of cutting out what is apparently a cancerous part of your soul to try to save the rest of it. You mentally clear your throat, and you turn to address Blunt-snout, looking into the frosty gaze of that tremendous mountain of amethyst, which is like looking eye-to-eye with a Kodiak bear. {{I suppose that there is one way that I can believe that you are not really a threat to me and Dizzy-tail,}} you say to Blunt-snout. {{I mean really believe, not just politely say I believe because I want you to believe that I trust you, which is the only thing that I otherwise could do. There is just one way I could say I could believe you and not be a liar, myself.}}<br />
<br />
Blunt-snout harrumphs, responding, {{you never did trust me, whelp. You came here as an attacker, intent on hurting me, and you have behaved since you have been here as if you were being kept under duress, except there is neither a gate nor a chain keeping you here. My attempt to do your lover a favor, as a gesture of friendship toward you both, has left him covered in lacerations in a moment that you didn&#39;t even trust him. Look at you! You keep your wings wrapped around you like a shell, as if someone were going to attack you at any moment...or as if you had been beaten up by larger whelps too often at some point in your upbringing, and to tell...}}<br />
<br />
{{Well, I was,}} you respond icily.<br />
<br />
Blunt-snout glares back. {{You were what?}} he asks flatly.<br />
<br />
{{Beaten up a lot by others,}} you reply, {{not that I blame them. I always looked ridiculous. Look at me, you jerk! Do you think I could ever respect myself as a drake? I look more like a frog than a dragon.}} You drop your head.<br />
<br />
Dizzy-tail noses you gently. {{I think you look a little bit like a very pretty hen, and it&#39;s okay for hens to be plump}} he says softly. {{I&#39;ve even known fat brood-hens that started laying clutches young and never flew a wing-beat in their lives. It&#39;s mostly more forward-looking hens that say they can fly as well as any drake and are good for something besides breeding more warriors, and those that endeavor to can, often exceptionally. We found that out toward the end of the war. Since I like both drakes and hens, you know, I think you can be pretty in both ways...}} he trails off.<br />
<br />
You shift uncomfortably as you look over yourself, looking back at your wide hips that give you such sprawling, frog-like hindquarters. &quot;Egg-laying hips,&quot; you guess dragons must call them, which in your human life had been hips that even had the gym coach enthusiastically taunting you, gleefully telling the class, &quot;HERE is why you should get your EXERCISE!&quot; as he pinched you. You didn&#39;t so much &quot;walk&quot; as &quot;waddle,&quot; which made you so self-conscious that you just avoided walking at all, sitting hunched off to one side, reading stuff online, and trying not to be noticed too much. {{So you both think it&#39;s funny that I look like a hen?}} you ask them softly.<br />
<br />
{{Is it such a terrible thing to be funny?}} Dizzy-tail asks you gently, his eyes looking deeply into yours. They are the same deep pools you originally fell into. {{I like you for how you are, Amber-fields. You&#39;re sweet and humble and earthly and nice like a favorite teacher that loves hatchlings and plans hatch-day parties for whelps. Did you really think I was attracted to you because somehow I&#39;m too stupid to see that? I let you do the things you do to me because I can&#39;t possibly believe that there is evil intent or selfishness in anything that you do, Amber-fields.}}<br />
<br />
You drop your head to the side. {{But I want there to be more to me than that, Dizzy-tail,}} you send back to him flatly. {{Can&#39;t you see you&#39;re objectifying me as if I were this virtuous, saintly brood-hen, when really, maybe there is another side of me? A side that can do things like what you and Blunt-snout were doing? A side of me that fucked you in the ass out of nothing but pure carnal bestial lust for your body? Have you spent all that time thinking you loved me because I was too pure to have those sorts of feelings? Trust me: I might be a drake that looks like a MILF, but now that I am started being honest, there are times that I just use you as a sex toy, knowing we both enjoy it. Yeah, it was selfish, but a perceived absence of selfishness or desire can never be a good reason for loving me. Think, Dizzy-tail! I did the same thing to you, assuming that I could only love you if you were clean and pure, yet here you stand, covered in the filth of another drake: I only see more clearly that what was really pure, all along, was your heart. I had put the rest of you into a sterile, soulless box, having confused that sterility with purity. Well, I don&#39;t want that sterility anymore. It bleaches the soul and goodness out of everything.}}<br />
<br />
Dizzy-tail grins conspiratorially. {{So what you&#39;re saying, in your ponderous, geeky, overthinking way, is that you think that those sassy brood-hen hips you&#39;ve got there can spread out far enough to take Blunt-snout&#39;s dick, right?}} he asks mischievously.<br />
<br />
Before you can start blushing at that proposition, Blunt-snout butts into the conversation, querulously interjecting. {{Now, you young whelps, I&#39;m not some piece of meat!}}<br />
<br />
You and Dizzy-tail both look at him at the same time. {{Yes, you are,}} Dizzy-tail says. You both start giggling.<br />
<br />
With a smirk, you start getting into the act, dropping your thought-tone to a sultry purr as you add, {{and Blunt-snout, weren&#39;t you just telling me that I have been a very very bad hen? Surely, you must think it&#39;s time I be punished.}}<br />
<br />
{{I would split you in two,}} Blunt-snout says flatly.<br />
<br />
{{You&#39;re an elder, Blunt, not the hen-splitter you were in your prime,}} Dizzy-tail snipes.<br />
<br />
{{Then I&#39;ll report you for elder abuse!}} Blunt-snout retorts.<br />
<br />
You strut up to the mountain of amethyst determinedly, fanning out your wings for the first time in a while and angling your brood-hen hips toward him as you approach, smiling wryly as you start accepting what they are. {{It was you that chastized me for being such an uptight zankteuful, Blunt-snout. Well, I am prepared to plea guilty. I&#39;m prepared to take my punishment like the naughty, young hen I am. I am ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.}}<br />
<br />
Blunt-snout hangs his head in perfect defeat. {{The things I do for you young whelps,}} he pouts...</p>
