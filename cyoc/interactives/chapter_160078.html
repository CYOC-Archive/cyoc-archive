<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark ignored Aidans frozen form and turned back to the laptop. He liked the feeling of power he had now, but he didn´t want to hurt Aidan. Quiet the opposite, he had feelings for him and was sure Aidan didn´t feel the same. He would have a bit of fun with Aidan, but he wouldn´t want Aidan to take revenge on him. So he thought of a way to keep the power without fearing revenge. To achieve that, he would need the chronivac to be his and his alone.<br />
He tried to duplicate the laptop out of thin air, but that didn´t work. So he took a pencil from Aidans art utensils and with that could duplicate the laptop with only one difference, the copy had no chronivac. He smiled while he unplugged Aidans original laptop, keeping the duplicate outside.<br />
Aidan didn´t know what Mark was planning, but why was he packing Aidans laptop after duplicating it? He hadn´t been able to see what Mark had typed, so he had no idea that this laptop had no chronivac for him to use, not that it mattered with what Mark planned.<br />
After packing the laptop Mark turned back to Aidan, smiling. &quot;You can talk again, but when you talk with me you can only speak the truth and you feel compelled to answer any question I gave you.&quot;<br />
Aidan was taken aback by this. He didn´t want to answer any question Mark could think off truthfully, what if he asked something like &quot;Who do you have a crush on?&quot;, that would be embarrassing.<br />
But Mark had other plans with his comment. &quot;Aidan, what have you changed with the chronivac since you got it?&quot;<br />
Aidan turned red thinking about his earlier mistake, but started answering. &quot;After the laptop update itself to a newer model I tested it by changing my eye color from hazel to sky blue. Then I wanted my cock to be bigger, but had the wrong measurement picked, making it smaller instead. It says you can´t change the same body part more than once every twelve hours without consequences, so I didn´t change it back. That was when you knocked. The other changes were what you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark didn´t have any interest in that consequences, at least not for him changing Aidan. He laughed a bit about the embarrassment of Aidan. &quot;Well, let´s see. Your hair will return to it´s original black color as well as your cock and balls will return back to his former size.&quot;<br />
Aidan could feel his genitals growing down there and was happy Mark had changed them back, even if he wanted them bigger. He just hoped that there would be no negative consequences for him. &quot;Thanks Mark. Now I feel more like a man again.&quot;<br />
Mark laughed at that. &quot;Well, no problem there, Aidan. But now to the next point. You will forget that something like the chronivac exists and everything that happened through it, you just got a new laptop today. You will also forget that your eyes ever had another color to begin with, they were always blue. And you will never question any changes I make to you. You know I can change you or make you do things, but you have no clue how and didn´t ask. You can comment on changes but finally accept them after they have set in.&quot; Mark grinned after he finished.<br />
&quot;But Mark, that&#39;s not fair. We could both have fun with this. Please don´t ...&quot; Aidan stopped mid-sentence when he forgot about the program, therefore didn´t know why he was angry at Mark, the &quot;... let me forget the chronivac.&quot; went with it. He just grabbed his head in a bit of confusion and pain. <br />
Mark waited a bit, showing a bit of concern. “What happened Aidan? Having a headache?”<br />
“Yeah, all of the sudden I feel like my head has split open. Don´t know why. I will look for your book later, Mark.” Aidan answered.<br />
“Hey, it´s okay. If you aren´t feeling so well. But I have another question. I know you are interessted in other men, but on who do you have a crush, Aidan?”´Mark asked smiling at him. Aidan was still bond to tell him the truth after all.<br />
Aidan got a bit red when he started answering. “Well, I like my classmate, Jeremy Smith, but he isn´t gay as far as I know. And I like my neighbor Geoff Carter and don´t know how he felt about something like that.” After having answered these direct, Aidan got even redder.<br />
Mark looked a bit sad hearing that, at least to Aidan. “So you have no crush on me I guess?”<br />
“I see you like a good friend, maybe even my best one. But I think your are also not gay, and that is why I have ignored those thoughts until they have been mostly vanished. I´m sorry, Mark.” Aidan explained, now as red as a tomato. “Why am I so honest about my feelings?”<br />
Mark perked up a bit. “So you had a crush on me sometime ago? Are you sure that the crushes on Jeremy and Geoff are stronger than that? From how you look right now, I would say you have a really deep crush on me and none on the other two.” Then he grinned at Aidan.<br />
Aidan himself didn´t notice the reason, but he felt the change in his emotions while he argued. “No, really Mark, my feelings for you are no longer there. But … I´m sorry for being ignorant to these feelings for so long Mark. It´s clear as day I like you more than any other person.” Aidan was confused again, something was weird, but he couldn´t place it.<br />
Mark grinned brightly at him. “It´s okay, Aidan. I was never sure if you are gay until recently, so I never had the courage to ask. But that means we could be together.” And with that Mark kissed Aidan.</p>
