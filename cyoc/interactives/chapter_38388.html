<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she rushed to her room, Erika could feel strange twinges in the muscles of her lower back, as though they were stretching and shifting. It was not painful, just strange, like the way she felt in gym class when they were doing stretches and she was just about at the limits of how far that she could go. That was different though, since in gym class it was her arms and legs that she was stretching and this was at the base of her spine.<br />
<br />
Once in her room she closed her door, made sure the blinds were down on her window so that no one could look in and pulled down her skirt and panties which had started to press uncomfortably against her butt. Straining to turn her head to look at her own butt, she heard a series of popping sounds. Almost unconsciously she tensed the muscles of her back and butt and to her surprise she saw something move.<br />
<br />
She tired again and felt her muscles moving in a way they never had before. Out of the corner of her eye she saw the source of the strange feelings, her tailbone had extended out into an actual tail.<br />
<br />
It was quite short, only six inches long and hairless, so she had no clue what sort of tail it might be.<br />
<br />
For a time she simply stood there, flexing her new muscles and watching her new tail move. It was fascinating to watch, to have control over something that she had never had until that day. On some level she knew that she probably should have been alarmed, but it was such a small tail that she was sure she would have no trouble hiding it, not to mention it made the afternoon far more interesting than normal.<br />
<br />
After a little while she grew bored with flexing her new little tail and decided to get dressed again.<br />
<br />
Several attempts to put her panties back on failed when she was unable to find a way to fit them around her tail.<br />
<br />
Since panties were out of the question, skirts were as well, so she put on a pair of pants, making sure that they were baggy enough to conceal her tail.<br />
<br />
Left with nothing else to do she began to work on her school assignments. Even though it was Friday night and she had the whole weekend to get the work done she was a fairly good student and liked to get her work done early so that she could enjoy her days off. All she had was a reading assignment and a few math problems which wasn't bad at all since she liked reading and the work they were doing in math class that week was mostly review.<br />
<br />
Math was her least favorite so she decided to get that out of the way first. getting her work book out she sat down at the little desk in her room and made herself comfortable.<br />
<br />
Sitting with her tail was a very different sensation, even though it was small she found herself having to adjust her posture to keep from sitting on it or crushing it against the back of the chair. Soon she was so involved in solving math problems that she failed to notice that she had raised her tail up to hold it against her back, she also failed to notice when it worked its way up under the waistband of her pants. She only noticed when she finished her work and got up to stretch. When she stretched her tail she felt it slip free of her pants and push them down a little.<br />
<br />
She shrugged and slipped her tail back into her pants, noting that it was a about a foot long and considerably thicker than it had been when she first noticed it. A quick look in the mirror showed that her tail was not noticeable so she wasn't too worried. In fact, the more she thought about having a tail the more she liked it. Twitching it in her pants she could feel how much stronger it had become and how much more control she had over it.<br />
<br />
The sound of a car pulling in the driveway let her know that her mother had come home from work, so she went to the kitchen to help set the table and get ready for dinner.<br />
<br />
Her mother was tired and didn't seem to notice that when Erika sat down to eat she was leaning forward slightly.<br />
<br />
During the meal Erika found herself having to fight to keep her tail from twitching when it began to itch. To keep her mother form noticing anything strange she ate as quickly as she could, cleared the table in a rush and excused herself, explaining that she was in the middle of a homework assignment that she really wanted to get done with.<br />
<br />
Her mother let her go without question and she went up to her room.<br />
<br />
The instant she shut the door she flicked her tail out of her pants and twisted it around to her front so she could see why it was itching.<br />
<br />
To her surprise and delight she discovered that it was no longer hairless. The itching had been due to thick, brown fur growing to cover it. Smiling she gently stroked it and marveled at how soft it was.<br />
<br />
She walked over to her mirror to turn around and admire her new tail, which when she let it hang down straight, reached down well past her knees. It was more comfortable for her to keep it raised, though. For a time she just stood there, admiring the way she could move her tail and how the fur looked. Her tail was strong and maneuverable too and on a whim she decided to see just how much control she had over it.<br />
<br />
First she crouched down and used it to pick up her pants, which was surprisingly easy. Next she tried to use it to pull out her chair and found that it was strong enough to do so. From there she began to pick up and move whatever she could until her mother called to her to tell her that it was time that she took a shower and went to bed, her homework would still be there in the morning.<br />
<br />
Doing as she was told she went to the bathroom and continued to experiment with her tail. She used it to turn on the water, to pick up her washcloth and soap, and then to hold the washcloth to scrub herself. After she washed the rest of her she carefully shampooed her tail, then used conditioner to make sure the fur stayed nice and soft.<br />
<br />
By the time she was ready to brush her teeth her tail was long enough that she could use it to hold her toothbrush.<br />
<br />
When she finally curled up in bed she fell asleep with a smile on her face, thinking about what she would do the next day.</p>
