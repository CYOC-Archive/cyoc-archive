<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily shifted Kaitlyn&#39;s backpack as it dug into her shoulders and stared at the junior high school. In an about half hour or so she knew she&#39;d have to enter the building and pretend to be her sister for one whole day. She recalled all the embarrassment and difficulties she herself had faced and compared them to the complaints Kaitlyn often lamented about and found she didn&#39;t want to go through with having once again to face being in junior high. But, knowing she couldn&#39;t very well skip, she found herself in a predicament as she headed over to a bench and sat down.<br />
<br />
A quick search of her sister&#39;s pack revealed the other girl didn&#39;t keep much of anything in order and that everything had simply been shoved in there. Glad that their mom hadn&#39;t trusted her with the homework she&#39;d worked on last night and would be taking it directly to the school instead, or, as she put it, &quot;I don&#39;t trust you in turning this in,&quot; Emily began pulling stuff out.<br />
<br />
Slowly, she sorted the mess out and began to figure out which classes Kaitlyn had and at one time and on what day. Making note of it in a notebook, she put the essential stuff back into the bag and left the weird, gross and unessential stuff out. Searching out for a trash can, she spotted one. Dumping the items she didn&#39;t believe were needed, she turned back to collect her sister&#39;s backpack, but stopped when a haughty looking teenage girl with breasts that Emily thought to be near C cup size, knocked Kaitlyn&#39;s bag off the bench. Smirking as she did this, the girl looked at Emily and sneered, &quot;Hey, zits for tits. I didn&#39;t think they would allow a freak like you dress like a girl. Anyway. Aren&#39;t you actually a boy pretending to be a girl. Or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
It suddenly coming to Emily that she knew this girl stuffed her bra to make her breasts look bigger, though she wasn&#39;t too sure how she understood this, she glared at the girl. Definitely cross her arms, she stated, &quot;You aught to think about what you&#39;re saying,&quot; and as the girl started mocking this, Emily added, &quot;And at least I don&#39;t have to stuff my bra, badly I might add, to gain the attention of the entire junior. And the senior high football team,&quot; and making an O shape, she made a sucking noise as she grabbed up Kaitlyn&#39;s pack.<br />
<br />
Outrage, the girl sniffed, &quot;Shut up,&quot; then, &quot;You are so going to regret that. Wait until I tell everyone,&quot; in a haughty manner.<br />
<br />
A giggle escaped her and Emily adjusted her sister&#39;s backpack so that it was sitting comfortably. As she did this, she stated, &quot;Yeah? What are you going to tell people? The truth maybe? That you are the by-product of two New York hookers screwing each other and the entire sixty-ninth division on a naval battleship? That that is your family legacy you live up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you dare talk about my father,&quot; the girl screeched and launching herself at Emily, fist raised, she never got more than a couple steps before she was stopped by a teacher, who&#39;d been drawn by the sounds of their voices.<br />
<br />
The teacher, who Emily recognised as Mrs Platt, who she had for math when she&#39;d been in junior high, glared at both of them a couple seconds. Seeing that Amelia was really upset about something, she peered at the one she saw as Kaitlyn and snapped, &quot;Kaitlyn Johnson. What exactly are you up to now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Indignant, Emily glared daggers at the other girl a moment. Eventually looking at Mrs Platt, she stated, &quot;I am defending myself using words from this, idiot, who threw my bag on the ground for no reason and insists on calling me stupid names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a lie,&quot; Amelia cried out, angrily. &quot;I was minding my own business when she started in on my family. Said my parents were hookers, or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to deal with another row between the two girls, knowing full well that Amelia, for some reason, had it in for Kaitlyn, Mrs Platt snapped, &quot;That&#39;s enough from both of you. You&#39;re to apologise to each other and go your separate ways. Either that, or I am taking you both the principal&#39;s office. Kaitlyn, that would make it four detentions in a row for you, which would mean suspension. Amelia, that would mean your second detention in a row.&quot;<br />
<br />
A dislike of the girl came over her and Emily didn&#39;t want to say she was sorry, nor wish to shake the other girl&#39;s hand. But, thinking how pissed her mother would be, she begrudgingly mumbled, &quot;Sorry,&quot; and waited to see what the other girl would do.<br />
<br />
Amelia, not willing to concede, glared venomously and didn&#39;t say anything. When Mrs Platt told her, &quot;Amelia, Kaitlyn has apologised. Do you have anything to say?&quot; Amelia continued to stare at the other girl. After a couple seconds, she snapped, &quot;I&#39;m not saying anything to zits for tits. Not until she specifically says she is sorry for insulting my dad,&quot; and trying to launch herself at Emily, she screeched, &quot;My dad is proud to serve his country. What has your dad ever done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shocked at this, Emily took a step back as Mrs Platt came between them and exclaimed, &quot;Principal&#39;s office. Now,&quot; and marching Amelia off, who was still carrying on, Emily stood rooted in place until first bell rang.<br />
<br />
Trudging into school, hurt as memories of her dad, who had run-off sometime around Kaitlyn&#39;s sixth birthday, flooded her, Emily made her way to her sister&#39;s first class. Thinking about their step-father, who nearly all the time was better than their actual dad, which she figured was why she at least often acted like he was their real father, she felt like she&#39;d barely taken a seat when the bell ran to announce the end of the period. Her thoughts on her family, what Kaitlyn had done, and trying to figure out if maybe it had something to do with what her sister had done, Emily drifted through the school day, thankful she didn&#39;t see Amelia any more.<br />
<br />
When school finally let out, she hastily repacked her bag and filed out with everyone else. Her thoughts on finding Jacob and seeing if he&#39;d gotten a hold of Kaitlyn, she hurried home. There, to her surprise, he mom told, &quot;Into the car, young lady. I&#39;ve seen the state of some of you clothes. That, and you could use some feminine products,&quot; and wanting to argue that she needed to talk to Jacob, she never got the chance as her mother snapped, &quot;You&#39;re still grounded, so none of your foolishness. Do I make myself clear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Subdued, Emily nodded. Watching as her mother left a note, she hoped Jacob was doing all right as she dropped her bag near the front door and headed out with her mom.</p>
