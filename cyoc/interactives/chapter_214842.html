<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was a bit surprised to see that David was still nervous about the party. Even though he now had someone he had sex with on the regular along with already having sex with Mark, he still seemed to be cautious as he walked up to Mark&#39;s front door. Or it could have just been that the clothes he was wearing were actively too small for him now. The medium sized shirt that had been just about a half size too big for him was now starting to strain against his growing body.<br />
<br />
Muscles that he&#39;d never thought about were actually starting to develop and show some growth. Biceps had rounded out ever so slightly. Pecs were starting to push out his front. Abs were growing in and even pressing up against the fabric. It almost felt like David had forgotten about that wish as he pulled at the collar of his shirt that was tightening around his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon!&quot; Trevor shouted as he jumped out of the truck and ran to the house. It was a fairly large two story house in the suburbs with a perfectly cut lawn and a large wooden privacy fence that went around the backyard. Beer cans and red solo cups were littered around the front yard that were clearly meant to be cleaned up at a different time. <br />
<br />
David was still a bit slow to get out of his truck. &quot;I wish I fit in with the guys here,&quot; he muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
I chuckled, as David didn&#39;t realize that I was still listening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I fit MY DICK WITHIN the guys here,&quot; David said. His breathing slowed a bit as he realized what he just wished for. Dozens of new sexual experiences with the guys at the party started to fill his mind. He couldn&#39;t believe that any of the men he could vividly remember having sex with would have even talk to him, let alone let him top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, Is something the matter?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; he stammered a bit as he slowly headed to the front door. &quot;It&#39;s just I&#39;m trying to get used to that last wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course master. To think you were so sexually promiscuous,&quot; I implied, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have guessed.&quot;<br />
<br />
David&#39;s face burned red. &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; he nodded. Of course, he wasn&#39;t so a small sense of confusion lingered as he knew those were the words that had come out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
However, as he opened the door, he hadn&#39;t realized that even just Trevor&#39;s presence was enough to stop the party. &quot;WHO INVITED THE DWEEB?&quot; Ashley shouted. Several of the jocks were gathering around Trevor. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I did,&quot; David answered. Instantly Jacob, Devon and Marquis stopped in their tracks. &quot;Sorry. I thought it&#39;d be okay... Since Mark invited me...&quot;<br />
<br />
The anger instantly dissipated out of the men as the looked over at David. Sudden memories of why the less popular guy was invited was fresh in their mind. &quot;Ehh... It&#39;s fine,&quot; Jacob was the first to speak up. The kicker might have been one of the lowest ranking in terms of authority, but he also didn&#39;t want any more trouble than he needed. His tall lithe body was built more for soccer, but with that being in the spring Coach Sinclair was happy to use his powerful legs to punt the ball all the way down the field or go for a field goal when they needed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s fine,&quot; echoed Devon. The big linebacker wasn&#39;t exactly known for trying to cause too much of a stir if he didn&#39;t have to. His broad shoulders and thick burly frame along with the fact that he stood a head taller than nearly everyone else gave him a real presence when he entered a room. That size tended to be all the reason someone needed to not go against him. <br />
<br />
Marquis took Ashley under his muscular arm and led her into the kitchen. &quot;It&#39;s alright babe. He won&#39;t bother us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahsley rolled her eyes as she put more of her weight onto her running back boyfriend. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said, but not before flicking Trevor off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...&quot; Trevor muttered. His mood dropped a bit as the party went back to its usual self. An awkward unwanted air hung around him as he stood near the staircase. It hung onto him until he saw David. &quot;Your genie!&quot;<br />
<br />
David panicked as Trevor nearly jumped him. &quot;W-what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your genie!&quot; he repeated. &quot;You can wish me to be more popular!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are... Are you sure?&quot; David asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man! Wish that I was a jock!&quot; Trevor said. &quot;Then I can be just like them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Okay?&quot; David turned to me. &quot;I wish that Trevor was a jock.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was getting to be too easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Trevor was a PERSONAL, INDESTRUCTABLE, USED jock.&quot; David paused as he heard the wish. As did Trevor. But before the man could speak his mouth stitched closed. His body started shrinking. Every second he lost another inch or two of his height. He tried to fight as his arms reached over his head. When his hands touched, they connected. Any space between them were gone. Now as he pulled, they seemed to stretch. Each time pulling back to their original size.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; David pleaded as he reached out for his friend. Trevor&#39;s skin was already turning to fabric. All the color drained from body as he continued to shrink. Suddenly David was holding Trevor in the air. Trevor&#39;s legs bent behind him and his feet began to connect to his ass. They thinned out to two stretchy bands that David could easily fit his legs into. &quot;What do I do? what do I do?&quot; David turned to me. An answer came to him. &quot;I wish that Trevor wasn&#39;t a jock.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Trevor wasn&#39;t a HAPPY jock UNLESS WORN,&quot; David wished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted,&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
Confusion hit David. &quot;But... But...&quot; he continued to hold the jock in his hand. Was that what he wanted? It didn&#39;t feel right, but those were the words that came out of his mouth. &quot;How would I know if he&#39;s happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrugged. &quot;You could always make another wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True...&quot; David looked around and held tightly to the jock. He went to the bathroom and dropped his pants and underwear, barely even registering that more muscle was still adding onto his body. What had been small little bean poles were now starting to develop into actual legs. Quads were starting to take over the room between his thighs and his calves were really showing some development. And when he&#39;d kicked off his shoes, a wave of relief overcame his feet as they were no longer cramped inside a space that was becoming far too small for them.<br />
<br />
David then stepped into the leg holes of the jock and raised it up his body. The strap fit perfectly over his pert butt. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you happy now?&quot; asking Trevor. I was kind of curious how David expected an inanimate object to respond. He obviously didn&#39;t know either as he turned to me. &quot;Uhh... I wish he would show me when he was happy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Another easy one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wisht he would show me BY SUCKING DICK when he was happy,&quot; David wished. When I snapped my fingers, David&#39;s body fell forward. His hands gripped the sink of the bathroom with all his might. &quot;Oh fuck...&quot; he moaned as the fabric of the jock began to gently wrap around his cock. It continued to twist and turn, finding as many sensitive areas as it possibly could. David&#39;s dick was already leaking into it. Pre stained the soft fabric.<br />
<br />
But that only seemed to make the clothing happier as its tempo started to speed up. David grunted and groaned as pleasure rocketed through him. His body wouldn&#39;t listen to him as the only thing he could think about was the soft feeling of his cock being massaged. David&#39;s breathing grew haggard. He was barely holding on. His body thrust the air trying to satiate the sexual arousal running through him, but it was coming directly from his clothing.<br />
<br />
Without warning, David felt himself finish into the jock. &quot;Fuck...&quot; he panted. The afterglow washed over him as he leaned against the bathroom sink for support. A bit of sweat from the sudden and intense workout dripped down his forehead. He wiped it away. Then realized just how big of a mess he had made in the jock. &quot;Oh man! This is so embarrassing! I wish I didn&#39;t have to clean this up!&quot;<br />
<br />
I chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I didn&#39;t have to clean this up BECAUSE TREVOR&#39;S SELF-CLEANING,&quot; David said. And as he said it the obvious stain that he&#39;d made started to disappear right before his eyes. &quot;Woah...&quot; David smiled. &quot;That&#39;s really convenient...&quot;</p>
