<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slamming the door shut, Alex gasped for breath for a few moments, his body unused to all of the physical exertion from the day. The fumes from his clothes were becoming overpowering, the piss and cum mixing into a noxious perfume, and to his horror he kind of liked the smell. Quickly tearing them off, Alex dumped the clothes into his laundry pile and closed his eyes, fingers pressed to his temples. So many things had happened in the past few hours, and his mind was feeling even more clouded and confused than before. Thoughts of servicing Jack again kept clamoring to the surface, and the whole experience had been exhilarating in a way that Alex couldn&#39;t have anticipated... and yet, the rational part of his mind knew something was very, very wrong.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he took off his glasses and began rubbing the cum and piss off of the lenses with a towel. As he put them back on, Alex turned his head slightly and caught a glimpse of his naked body in the full length mirror on the wall. He&#39;d never been a looker, and his perpetual inability to gain any muscle had left him thin and not terribly attractive... but something was off with his reflection. Peering closer, he let out a soft yelp as he realized that all of his body hair was just... gone. Alex had always had a bit of a hairy chest, but now there wasn&#39;t a single hair to be found on his torso, crotch, legs or arms. &quot;What the hell...&quot; he said, incredulous.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s body hair wasn&#39;t the only thing that had changed. Not only did his figure look more filled out, he could tell that his skin was a few shades lighter, approaching an unnatural porcelain colour, and his nails almost had a shiny white sheen to them now. Alex&#39;s feet and lips looked a little larger than normal too, and his normally flat ass was looking a hell of a lot more perky. &quot;Fuck me... this makes no sense at all...&quot; Alex sighed, starting to wonder if he was just seeing things. Shaking his head, he pulled on a new set of boxers, jeans and T shirt, noting they all felt a little tighter than normal. His ass especially seemed to be straining a little against the fabric of his jeans, and it felt cushier as Alex sat down to start working on some homework problems.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, he felt a deluge of thoughts overrun his mind. What was he thinking, working on homework when he should be out pleasuring guys? They weren&#39;t going to service themselves, especially Jack. What he needed to be doing right now was finding another guy to pleasure, and Alex couldn&#39;t think of anything better to be doing. His rational mind was pushing back, straining against these new urges, but his body wouldn&#39;t listen. Standing up, Alex left his dorm room behind and walked back to campus, finding his way to yet another washroom on campus. Somehow it just felt the right place to be...<br />
<br />
Alex slapped his face, trying to snap out of it. None of this made any sense - the strange thoughts, the paler skin, the bigger ass. &quot;What the fuck did Jack do to me...&quot; he muttered as someone walked in.<br />
<br />
The man who walked in was the definition of a bear - tall, incredibly big, huge belly and body hair all over the place. His gruff look, huge frame and thick beard made him look more like a bouncer than a janitor, which was what his uniform identified him as. Just seeing him gave Alex the beginnings of a hard on, and he blushed a little as the janitor walked right up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange place to put a toilet,&quot; the janitor muttered, unbuckling his belt. Confused, Alex stared at the man with a puzzled expression until the janitor suddenly grabbed him by the head and pushed him down to the ground. As soon as Alex&#39;s knees made contact with the bathroom floor, they stuck like glue, looking almost like they&#39;d partially merged with the ground. Alex looked up in a mixture of fear and confusion as the man pulled his dick out, hovering right before his mouth. <br />
<br />
The janitor let a finger run across Alex&#39;s lips before parting them open with little resistance. As he opened his mouth, Alex felt his head turning back more and more, at this point far past a normal angle. He wanted to say something, tell the janitor that he wasn&#39;t a toilet, but then a rush of excitement ran through him. He was going to be used! He was going to help this janitor relieve himself, and Alex was going to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
The janitor shoved his cut cock into Alex&#39;s mouth, its girth needing the extra space he&#39;d provided. The janitor sighed as he began to piss, the yellow liquid running down Alex&#39;s throat. Its acrid taste almost seemed better than anything he&#39;d ever tasted before, and Alex moaned as the janitor continued to piss, wanting and needing more and more.<br />
<br />
After about a minute, the janitor&#39;s piss began to taper off, but the expression on his face changed. &quot;Didn&#39;t know these toilets were so advanced these days,&quot; he grinned, beginning to thrust into Alex&#39;s face. As the janitor&#39;s dick got harder and harder, Alex felt his entire form beginning to stiffen, his neck shrinking as his arms became stuck to his body. It was beginning to feel natural, kneeling there and pleasuring the janitor as Alex&#39;s mind was overwhelmed with ecstacy. It didn&#39;t take long for the janitor to cum into his mouth, and Alex involuntarily felt his body seize up and freeze at it happened, stuck in place on the ground.<br />
<br />
Pulling his pants back up, the janitor buckled his belt and washed his hands in the nearby sink as Alex stared on. &quot;Gotta get me one of those,&quot; the janitor grinned, whistling as he exited the washroom. Alex stayed on the floor, frozen in place with his mouth open, waiting to service someone else for what felt like ages. All he could think of was how wrong this was, how he shouldn&#39;t be stuck to the floor, and how the pleasure-ridden thoughts that kept overriding his mind were only accelerating whatever was happening.<br />
<br />
After maybe an hour, Alex felt movement beginning to return to his body, his knees and feet detatching from the floor and his arms unmerging from his body. Gasping, he fell forwards, steadying his body against the cold bathroom floor as his mind raced. He began to stand up when, all of a sudden, he felt his bowels release involuntarily. First, he began to piss all over himself, and Alex raced to the nearby stall to pull his jeans and boxers down. His clothes caught maybe the first half of the stream, but once the piss subsided it was replaced with cum, Alex moaning in pleasure as his suddenly hard cock cummed into the toilet. His unnaturally white, unnaturally hairless body was terrifying to look at - and yet those thoughts kept coming back, telling him he looked better than he ever had. <br />
<br />
Somehow, Alex knew he was passing the point of no return, and as he struggled to pull his piss soaked jeans and boxers back up over his form, he heard the washroom door open yet again...<br />
<br />
Panting, Alex held his hands up and saw they were now most definitely porcelain coloured. He put a hand up to his head and realized his eyebrows and hair had fallen out, leaving him perfectly bald. Scrambling out of the bathroom, Alex stared into the washroom mirror and could see his entire body had lost half a foot in height, his lips even thicker and his ass now voluptuous.</p>
