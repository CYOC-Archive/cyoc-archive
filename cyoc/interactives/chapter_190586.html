<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate tentatively took Kerry&#39;s shoes. These were beige block heeled sandals. The heels were about 2 inches. It reminded Kate that if she got Kerry&#39;s legs she would lose height. She was currently 5&#39;6, Kerry was 3 or 4 inches shorter than her. &quot;Well here goes nothing&quot; She sat down on the bed and took her own shoes off. She, like Kerry, had also been wearing sandals without socks. She handed them to Kerry. &quot;I guess you will need these soon&quot; Kerry took them with an excited giggle. Tom and Michael just watched silently. <br />
<br />
Someone had placed the two red socks on the bed beside Kate. One at a time she put them on her feet. They just felt like ordinary socks to her. What was curious was that they seemed to be the perfect size for her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually you should wait a bit before you put Kerry&#39;s shoes on&quot; suggested Michael. &quot;We need to find out if they &#39;remember&#39; the last shoes they were in&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be Tom&#39;s shoes&quot; said Kerry &quot;Your feet would start changing into Tom&#39;s&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not ready to get Tom&#39;s big smelly feet&quot; said Kate in disgust. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you won&#39;t. But we should quickly find out&quot; said Michael. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel any tingling?&quot; asked Tom &quot;Sort of like pin&#39;s and needles&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly have butterflies in my tummy.....No wait my feet are tingling&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s about 30 seconds since you put the second sock on. That&#39;s about right. I think there is about a 30 second lapse before the tingling starts and the changes lingered for about 2 minutes after I took the socks off&quot; said Tom.<br />
<br />
Kate immediately pulled the socks off. &quot;Sorry Tom. I&#39;m just not ready for your feet&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone peered closely at Kate&#39;s exposed feet. &quot;They have changed!&quot; Kate declared. &quot;They are bigger and puffy!&quot; Unlike Kerry, Kate did not paint her nails. The toenails remained unvarnished.<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s feet continued changing. As they watched the feet got bigger. The became way out of proportion to the rest of Kate&#39;s body. After several minutes the tingling and the changing stopped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep you have my feet&quot; declared Tom. &quot;So the socks do remember&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m sorry Tom but I don&#39;t want your feet. I want Kerry&#39;s. If you&#39;ve seen enough I&#39;m going to put the socks back on, then Kerry&#39;s shoes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay with me&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate did exactly that. The tingling restarted shortly after she put the second sock on. Hurriedly she then placed her too large feet into Kerry&#39;s sandals. Initially they were too small to strap up but after a couple of minutes they fitted on Kate&#39;s now smaller feet. That was the signal Kate had been looking for. She didn&#39;t do up the straps, instead she took off the right shoe and sock. That revealed painted toenails and a replica of Kerry&#39;s right foot. &quot;Well it&#39;s definitely working!&quot; Kate declared. She turned to Kerry &quot;I guess you want your turn&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought we were going to swap legs. I want all of your long legs&quot; Kate didn&#39;t think her legs were particularly long but she guessed to Kerry they might seem that way. &quot;Besides, if I now wore the socks and your shoes, that would become the memory of the socks. You wouldn&#39;t be able to change your legs any further into mine&quot; She hoped Kate understood her logic. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. I could just wear the sand-shoes Tom was wearing when he had your body&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Or Kerry could just put her own shoes back on for a second before she starts changing. Then the memory in those shoes would be her body as it is now&quot; pointed out Michael.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! That would be smart&quot; declared Kerry. She immediately placed her feet back into her own sandals but didn&#39;t bother doing up the straps. She knew from Tom&#39;s experience last night that &#39;Wearing&#39; the shoes did not mean they had to be worn for long. She then sat on the bed beside Kate and reached for the socks.<br />
<br />
The others watched as Kerry put the socks on then placed her feet into Kate&#39;s sandals. After 30 seconds Kerry declared &quot;I feel tingling&quot; Several minutes later the tingling had moved up to her shins. Kerry pushed the socks down but kept then on so her shins could be seen. A change in skin colour was evident as was a &#39;plastic zone&#39; where the changes were occurring. All continued to watch as the changes moved up Kerry&#39;s legs. Tom timed the movement. Like he had experienced it moved about an inch every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Kerry like Kate was wearing a knee length skirt so there were no concerns about quickly needing to change clothes. The watches as the changes moved up to Kerry&#39;s knees and into her thighs. She stood up and and observed &quot;I think I&#39;ve gained at least an inch in height&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much further up are you going to let the changes go for?&quot; asked Michael<br />
<br />
&quot;Further yet. I&#39;m no longer scared, just excited&quot; she turned to Kate &quot;Are you happy for me to become a bit more of you? You know further up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mean up to your waist?&quot; Kate asked. Now that Kerry&#39;s changes were hidden under her skirt there wasn&#39;t much to watch, she had taken to examining her own painted toenails. <br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly even further. Do you mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate now realised Kerry was asking if she could let the changes proceed to her private bits. &quot;I can&#39;t see why not. But if you do that you have to let me do the same&quot; Kate began imagining having that hairless pussy she had explored on Tom this morning. She was excited by the prospect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve already shared my private parts with your husband. You are welcome to them&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have no say in this?&quot; asked Micheal<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Do you object?&quot; asked Kerry. She was surprised, Michael usually enjoyed kinky things<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, well not if it&#39;s alright with you two and Tom. I just think that swapping genitals is something we all need to agree upon up front. With Tom it was accidental. Now we are talking about going there on purpose. Where do we all stand when it comes to letting our spouses play with borrowed parts? Are you happy for me to have sex with Kerry if she has Kate&#39;s pussy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No objections from me&quot; said Tom. He felt a little guilty about having lesbian sex with Kate earlier when he had Kerry&#39;s parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor me&quot; said Kate. She hoped no one noticed she was blushing. She had also played with Kerry&#39;s parts already. It would be hypocritical for her to object.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor me&quot; agreed Kerry. She noticed the embarrassment of both Tom and Kate and guessed something might have already happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are all agreed in that case&quot; added Michael. He was trying to hide the boner which had just appeared.</p>
