<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I thought it was some sort of gimmick or something!?” Dylan said, panicking. He was sitting on the left side of his bed, Nova was right behind him. She shifted herself to be near him,<br />
“Wait. I’m confused,” she began, “Kelly is inside the lamp?”<br />
“Yeah...” Dylan’s head hurt from all of it, “the guy in the store said that whoever rubs it will become a genie and grant 3 wishes. I thought it would just... like... record your voice or something... like a toy,”<br />
“Dylan!” Nova said, loud and assertively. She grabbed his upper arms and looked him dead in the eyes, “it IS a toy... you really think that an object can do this?”<br />
Dylan looked at her blankly, the look of worry still in his eyes,<br />
“That’s crazy,” she said, “I mean I don’t even believe this is real and you’ve met me!” She chuckled,<br />
“But Nova!” Dylan said loud and serious, “the guy at the store. He was tall and lanky, and the way he explained it. He wasn’t selling a toy... it’s like he was selling an old family heirloom...”<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Nova said, her body shrugged down, she was no longer upright and stern, she slouched over and grabbed the lamp, “if you really think he’s in the lamp-”<br />
“No!” Dylan yelled suddenly. Nova stared at him, slightly shocked at what he just did.<br />
“So my boyfriend believes in magic, huh..?” She looked him in the eyes again, “no wonder you’re my type,”<br />
<br />
She rubbed the lamp.<br />
<br />
Before she could make a remark about how crazy this was, or that Kelly probably just left without them noticing, the spout of the lamp suddenly began to glow. It was a warm blue colour and it sparkled in the light. A blue glittery mist began to pour out of the lamp, into the air. Nova instinctively dropped the lamp out of panic and jumped behind an already cowering Dylan. The mist filled the air, forming a shape. It became more solid looking, slowing forming what appeared to be a human figure. Dylan knew that exact figure a mile away.<br />
<br />
The mist stuck together until finally, as the shape was complete. It lit up quite bright all of a sudden. A burst of light struck, blinding both Dylan and Nova for a second. They rubbed their eyes.<br />
<br />
They both looked through the temporary burn in their sight and saw...<br />
<br />
“Can you not drop it next time!?” Kelly said grumpily, he rubbed his head. His whole body was red. As he rubbed his head and looked at the two scared faces. He placed his hand on his face. He saw his hand as he did, holding it to look at it. He began to panic, his skin, if you could even call it up, turned suddenly to orange. Kelly was focusing on his skin change while Dylan and Nova were looking at him.<br />
<br />
Kelly had reappeared as a colourful genie. They looked, his face was just about the same, his hair was also the same, but the colour was a darker version of his skin colour. Speaking of his skin, it was a bright colour, but seemed to vary, but the two couldn’t figure out what made it change. It was also slightly transparent, like the mist. His body had a glowing edge to it. He didn’t look real. Especially his legs, or rather lack-thereof. His legs weren’t there, they were directly connected to the Lamp, it looked like some kind of tornado, becoming less opaque as it went into the lamp. He wasn’t wearing a shirt either. He was wearing a pair of shorts but those disappeared as his wispy legs went into the lamp.<br />
<br />
“Kelly?” Dylan said, breaking the silence,<br />
“Yeah it’s me, before you ask...” Kelly said instantly, “what the hell made you buy this thing!?”<br />
“I don’t know!? I just thought it looked cool...” Dylan said,<br />
“He became a Genie!” Nova yelled excitedly, “does that mean we can make wishes!?”<br />
“Nova!” Dylan shouted, “that’s far from the point! We need to figure out how the hell to change him back, first,” Nova huddled back, clearly upset. She hated not being the centre of attention.<br />
<br />
It was at this point, Kelly realised he wasn’t wearing a shirt. He tired to subtly cover himself with his arms. Though Dylan had been looking at Kelly’s chest, so there was really no sense trying to hide himself.<br />
<br />
“She’s right,” Kelly said,<br />
“Huh?” Dylan, and Nova said in unison,<br />
“In order for me to change back, you have to give me three wishes to grant from you...” he paused, “and... I have a weird urge...”<br />
“An urge?” Dylan questioned, a little accusatory, probably still recovering from shouting at Nova. Kelly went bright yellow, his expression was clearly embarrassed. It clicked in Dylan’s head that the colours were linked to emotions,<br />
“N-no I mean...” Kelly stuttered, “I have an urge to grant you wishes... it’s nothing like I’ve ever felt before... it’s weird...”<br />
<br />
“Okay well... if you need wishes... I wish I had one hundred thousand dollars, I wish I had a new chair, I wish for a bigger room... there, three wishes off the top of my head. Do the magic and you’ll be back to normal...”<br />
“Umm...” Kelly panicked,<br />
“Well? Are you gonna fix yourself or what,”<br />
“I can’t grant your wishes... I think I can do some sort of magical power but I can’t grant your wishes...”<br />
“What? Why!?” Dylan began to angry,<br />
<br />
“Because I rubbed the lamp, stupid,” Nova said, both boys’ heads pointed to her,<br />
“Shit...” Dylan said, his head was in his hands,<br />
<br />
“So. For my first wish!” Nova yelled, she was cross legged. She was ready to make wishes.</p>
