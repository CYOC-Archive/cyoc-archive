<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Returning back to the Zen garden, Lance noticed that the council was still bickering over what to do regarding Jack Crawford’s threat. Most opting to call his bluff and letting the chips fall where they may and dragging the were-panther back to Moon Lake. Unsurprisingly, Martin Stovall was trying to advocate a more diplomatic approach that espoused patience. Randolph, the resident werewolf rep was busy stuffing his maw with sushi; while Rachael Gauldet, the were-otter rep just watched Randolph with a look of disgust on her face.<br />
<br />
Approaching the congregation and making his way to the center; Lance was surprised to see Leon talking quietly to Tachibana who currently was the only council memeber in her fursona. Curious as to why he wasn’t bellowing his thoughts loudly for all to hear; Lance made a slight cough to get their attention, interrupting their private chat.<br />
“You have news,” Tachibana looking at the were-panther rep.<br />
“I made my calls,” Lance answering; “most of the newspapers will have Ella’s article in their papers for tomorrow&#39;s edition.”<br />
“Most,” Leon asking; “why not all?”<br />
“Because the papers on the east coast,” Lance looking at the were-lion; “already have their presses running. They won’t be able to put the Crawford expose in their editions until Wednesday at the earliest. Except the Wall street Journal that is,” Lance adding; “I managed to get them just in time.”<br />
“It’s better than nothing,” Tachibana getting up; “and it will work well with what I have in mind.”<br />
<br />
Curious as to what Tachibana was referring to; Lance watched as the elder were-vixen was able to make everyone stop what they were doing and listen to what she had to say.<br />
“My fellow council members,” Tachibana speaking; “we have a plan in the works to deal with Jack Crawford. As Lance’s fellow purveyors of the news help us spread the word of Jack’s underhanded dealings and his wife’s questionable past; we will be contacting the various were-communities scattered throughout the world.”<br />
“How,” one council member shouts; “most if not all are extremely secretive. Afraid to even come to us.”<br />
“The Luna Brotherhood,” Tachibana responding; “the head of the organization is here in Moon Lake.”<br />
“How will that ex KGB Romanian help us,” the same council member shouting.<br />
<br />
“By spreading the word to all chapters,” the Romanian entering the garden; &quot;of Jack Crawford’s declaration of war. Sorry I’m late Tachibana,” the Luna head looking at the were-vixen; “I got held up with a cryptic call from a Benton Knight and few other matters.”<br />
“What did my brother want,” Lance sighing.<br />
“That I’m not sure of,” the werewolf Alpha answering; “but I have a feeling it has to do with this Crawford fellow. Now as you all know,” the Alpha speaking; “Jack Crawford has threatened to reveal the existence of our kind if he is brought back to Moon Lake by whatever means.”<br />
Tell us something we don’t know,” Randolph growling.<br />
&quot;The Luna Brotherhood chapter the world over,” the Alpha looking at Randolph disapprovingly; “will let the more secretive were-communities know of Jack Crawford’s threat. Everyone will know of him and he will soon become a pariah in those selfsame communities.”<br />
“He and his wife are already pariahs here,” Leon speaking; “how will ostracizing him everywhere else work?”<br />
“Currently the Seattle Chapter of the Luna Brotherhood is in disarray,” The alpha goes on explaining; “which means Jack Crawford will think he feels safe where he is. And for the moment he is. But everywhere else…”<br />
“You intend to make him a prisoner of Seattle,” Rachael looking confused; “how do you intend to do this if the man isn’t wanted by the local authorities?”<br />
“That is the tricky part,” the alpha speaking; “while we can’t stop the man from getting on a plane to say New York or Paris; we can however monitor his comings and goings out of Seattle. We will notify the were-communities he is nearby and they can refuse to do business with him and provide him safe harbor.”<br />
“While Lance’s expose cripples whatever dealings Jack Crawford has with the normal’s,” Martin Stovall shaking his head; “Isn’t your brother supposed to be the ruthless one Lance?”<br />
“Crawford will undoubtabley find a way around this,” the were-donkey rep braying; “but if it’s all we got short of having him killed…”<br />
“It’s better than nothing,” Leon glaring; “in the mean time we should focus on the press arriving in our town. We still have a mobster from San Francisco sitting in our Sheriff’s jail cell.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed,” Tachibana nodding; “unless there is anything else, I invite you all to have some food provided…”<br />
“You mean what Randolph hasn’t wolfed down already,” Rachael speaking; making the rest of the council erupt in laughter.<br />
“Oh very funny,” Randolph shaking his head; “if we are done, I’m going back to my mate and cub.”<br />
<br />
As some of the council members payed their respects to their hostess Tachibana before leaving; Daisuke along with Evan Lawson enter the Zen garden to see Lance, Leon and an unfamiliar werewolf talking to Tachibana.<br />
“Grandmother,” Daisuke speaking; “preparations have been made.”<br />
“Good,” Tachibana nodding; “at least one thing will be dealt with swiftly.”<br />
“What thing,” Lance looking confused.<br />
“Chelnik,” Leon speaking; “Frederick Parker’s bodyguard and former Spetsnaz. Or his body that is.”<br />
<br />
Last Sunday Morning, Chelnik was ordered by Frederick Parker to vandalize Benton Knight’s prized Lamborghini Veneno. Before the dangerous man could reach the Knight estate, he was spotted by FBI agent Brooke Reeds and deputy Samson Carter. The resulting scuffle in the woods resulted Samson getting wounded while Agent Brooke Reed shifted into her werewolf fursona and was able to kill the former Spetsnaz.<br />
<br />
“What did you do,” Lance looking at Daisuke and Evan.<br />
“We made it look like that the man was taken out by a rival Mobster of Frederick’s,” Daisuke answering; “sparing you the details, by the time the man’s body is discovered, it will mostly be bones.”<br />
“What of the were-virus in him,” Lance recalling the nature of the man’s demise; “wasn’t he on his way to becoming a werewolf before agent Reed killed him?”<br />
“Doctor Tora ran tests on Chelnik’s corpse,” Tachibana answering; “oddly enough and this is quite fortuitous for us; the were-virus like all the other viruses of the world needs a living host to survive. The were-virus in Chelnik is now inert and decomposing like the rest of Chelnik.”<br />
“Since Chelnik never fully transformed before his death,” Evan speaking; “the virus never had a chance to completely rewrite Chelnik’s DNA. By the time his body is found and tests are done to establish identity; the only DNA the authorities will find, is the traditional double helix of a human being.”<br />
“Well that is good news,” the Luna Alpha responding; “Tachibana if you will permit, I’d like to head back to my hotel room and begin making my necessary calls.”<br />
“You’re more than welcome to spend the night here,” Tachibana speaking to the Alpha; “there is plenty of room and what with the were-alert that will be extended for obvious reasons, you can be in your fursona thanks to the high walls surrounding my estate.”<br />
“Tempting as that may be,” the alpha answering; “I have to decline. Spending decades as a KGB agent for the former Soviet Union, I find displays of excess wealth off putting.”<br />
Then you’ll loathe my brother’s estate,” Lance chiming in; “no more ostentatious and downright gaudy place then his home. Assuming of course you are planning on meeting him.”<br />
“Perhaps at his office then,” the Alpha thinking; “but I’ll decide tomorrow. Take care everyone.”<br />
“I better get home as well,” Leon sighing; “Regina will want to talk regarding Peter and now…”<br />
“Go,” Tachibana nodding; “All of you. Let me meditate on our course of action.”</p>
