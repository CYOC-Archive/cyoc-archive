<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juanita Tiller, better known as JTassPlays aka PeachesnCreme, rubbed her perfectly formed breasts in front of the cameras. She had smooth skin, tanned to perfection, and as she massaged a breast she flipped her long blonde hair out of the way, smiling and revealing pearly white teeth. Along with her mesmerizing purple irises, her perfectly symmetrical features could literally break hearts. One of her donaters to her stream had told her he’d divorce his wife for her. She’d giggled and blew him off, she did have the body of a goddess, but it had bothered her.<br />
<br />
She sighed and moaned, hand trailing down her perfect runner’s body and slapped her heart-shaped ass. Donations poured in. Demands for more. For feet pics-actually the easiest money she’d ever made, even when they wanted her to do weird shit like step on loaves of white bread. She smiled and spoke to her fans, telling them she had a surprise for them.<br />
<br />
She heard clothes rustle to her side. Juanita spared a glance to her partner, David. He too was sculpted to perfection, like Michelangelo’s statue of David come to life. Perfect build, muscular but slim and athletic. Juanita pursed her plump red lips and blew him a kiss.<br />
<br />
David was her best friend and former roommate. He used to be a nerd, but thanks to the Book of Body, he had always been a hunk and she lost him as a friend….almost. Then she showed him the Book, demonstrated it on a couple across the street, and then asked him to change him.<br />
<br />
Yes, that was the correct pronoun. She used to be a guy named Chuck. Unfortunately the life of a woman proved harder than he’d expected. For some reason, the reality shift that had happened to David and the neighbors hadn’t happened to him. Chuck, now Juanita, had to buy clothes, get new papers, everything.<br />
<br />
Being a woman and pretending to be a woman were completely different experiences. Very expensive ones. So she and Chuck had hatched a plan to make money as streamers. By the time he could afford to actually be a woman, however, he hated it. Being a woman officially sucked now, it was a job for him-literally. In a way, he was thankful that the reality shift hadn’t occurred.<br />
<br />
>Who’s there? USER David1234 asked, donating $5.<br />
<br />
David entered the frame, 8 inch cock erect. Juanita gave a fake look of shock at the camera. Straight as she was, even she had to admit that David did something for her-at least when she was in this body.<br />
<br />
“Oh! It’s my friend David! What do you think we should do, guys?” Juanita placed a hand to her mouth in false shock.<br />
<br />
>Suck him off USER SAMhain said, donating $30<br />
<br />
>Let him rail you from behind USER Ganondorf45 said, donating $20<br />
<br />
>Use your feet to jerk him off USER Spacekat96 said, donating $50<br />
<br />
>Stop fucking with reality before you get pregnant, Chuck. USER RKPalatine said, donating $500.<br />
<br />
Juanita caught the last comment and froze. Someone knew who she was? She managed to recover and laughed off the donation.<br />
<br />
“Looks like the vote is foot-job! Okay, if you guys are sure?” Juanita batted her eyes in confusion, fishing for a few more donations.<br />
<br />
Messages poured in, telling her yes, that would be fine. SAMhain grumbled a bit, but he was loyal. David sat down next to her and shot the camera the kind of smile Superman would have if he were real. He pulled out a bottle of massage oil.<br />
<br />
“Come on babe, lay back and relax, you’ve been working sooo hard.” David cooed.<br />
<br />
Juanita sighed dramatically and fell back into his arms. He positioned her so her feet could be seen on the camera. Then he rubbed her feet sensuously. Juanita moaned and groaned. She didn’t actually enjoy it, not really her thing, but she played to the crowd.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” She bit her perfect lip and flexed her toes, “Right there, babe.”<br />
<br />
Her eyes fell on the shelf along the wall, where some of the new dildos they’d custom-order from a guy in Texas sat. She planned to show them off today, right after the foot-job. Give the dude some free advertisement. They were so realistic that she was even convinced that they moved and thrust on their own, despite not having any batteries. She was really excited in his newest sex doll, Big Hoss Hank the Horse. It was so detailed and had some many cool add-ons,it would definitely net her some big money on streams. She’d commission her own personal toy when she settled on the animal she wanted.<br />
<br />
Another donation came in, along with an alert. At least a $1000 dollars. She didn’t bother to look at it as she flexed and splayed her toes, writhing in feigned enjoyment. David glanced over at the newest donation and his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
>Fuck her silly and cum inside her USER RealityAuditor69 said, donating $100,000<br />
<br />
David licked his lips and stared down at her. Unlike ‘Juanita’, he didn’t hate his life. He loved it, especially after he compared his new life to his old ugly nerd life, thanks to touching the Book. And he really liked to stream with Juanita because…he loved her. He hadn’t just turned Chuck into the perfect woman, he’d turned her into HIS perfect woman.<br />
<br />
Sensing the pause, Juanita looked up at him and winked. “Ready lover boy?”<br />
<br />
She expected him to move her feet to his straining cock, but instead he splayed her legs wide, giving the camera a view of her tight shaved pussy. Confused, she shifted to the side and caught the last donation out of the corner of her eye. As she processed it, she could feel the tip of David’s perfectly formed cock circling her entrance.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” She hissed, blocking her entrance and knocking his cock away. “If you impregnate me I won’t change back until I birth it or abort it.”<br />
<br />
“Why would you want to abort our baby?” David asked, lips moving to nibble on her ear.<br />
<br />
Juanita tried to push him away, but found herself caressing his pec and moaning. “S-stop, we can’t fuck on stream.”<br />
<br />
“Stream?” David raised a perfect brow, “I’m just taping our love making.”<br />
<br />
She glanced at the screen and saw…nothing. No donations, no streams. Just a perfect angled shot of her and a close-up shot of her pussy from the two cameras in the room. Her new husband was finally going to claim her. Pleasure welled up deep inside her, though the thought was not hers. Her inner monologue was male. Wait, his. His inner monologue.<br />
<br />
David started massaging her breasts, kissing and flicking the nipples, each flick a little shock of pleasure. She moaned, enjoying the feeling despite herself. As his kisses moved up her neck, waves of pleasure radiated from her snatch. A wetness oozed between her fingers. Her free arm moved to encircle her lover, breath quickening.<br />
<br />
The kisses stopped and David gently pulled her hand free from her juicy pussy. He brought her hand to his lips and licked the fluids off them. He lowered his head to her pussy and lapped around her lips.<br />
<br />
Juanita cried out in pleasure as his tongue did things no sex toy or finger ever could. Something was wrong, but the tingles were telling her it was all right. She heard a faint *pop* and suddenly she wasn’t on the floor, she was in a Queen-sized bed in their honeymoon suite, her wedding dress in the corner on a hanger.<br />
<br />
He stared at the dress, horror edging out the pleasure. Why would he ever marry David? They were just-he failed to stifle a moan as David’s tongue flicked his clit-best friends. He couldn’t just fuck his best friend! No matter how attractive he was. And…he felt his breasts swell slightly…weren’t you supposed to marry someone you could spend your whole life with? She tried to push the voice out of her head, but it was hard when it sounded so similar to her own inner monologue.<br />
<br />
She found it hard to argue with that logic. Even harder because David chose that moment to slide his cock inside her, parting her glistening fold. She could see it on the monitor, David’s big cock gently opening her up with his thick cock like a flower. Juanita gave one final squirm but that merely let his cock bump against the side of her inner walls, lighting up her pleasure centers.<br />
<br />
David, I-ah!-I-you’ve gotta-” She wanted to tell him to stop, or at least wear a condom, but he pressed his lips to hers.<br />
<br />
“I love you too.” David broke the kiss, smiling down at her gently. “Ready?”<br />
<br />
“I-” Juanita tried, but gasped as she felt him bottom out, tip of his dick stretching her womb.<br />
<br />
David pulled out with a squelch that left her feeling empty, dick covered with fluids, before he plunged back in again and started pounding her, soft *pap*pap*paps* filling the room, alongside her moans. She tried to say something, but what could she say? Marrying her best friend was a good idea. Try as she might, with the pleasure filling her vision with stars every time his dick plunged in her, she simply couldn’t think of anything to say but-<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Juanita gasped. “I love you so much!”<br />
<br />
A ring *popped* on her finger.<br />
<br />
“I know sugar.” David grunted, pace of his thrusts increasing, “Let’s put a baby in you.”<br />
<br />
Juanita blinked. She wasn’t supposed to have a baby, right? She could always just abort it…but why would she abort their baby when they’d planned this for years? The pleasure was reaching a crescendo within in her, thoughts of having a baby and being pregnant and finally securing David as hers and she as his dancing through her mind.<br />
<br />
“David, I….” She gasped, the pleasure enveloping her, memories as Chuck fading and replaced as Juanita.<br />
<br />
She tried to grasp at them, but they slipped through her fingers like David&#39;s lovely cock slipped in and out of her luscious pussy.<br />
<br />
Being bullied at school crossed her mind, but David thrust in again with a gentle *pap*, and her walls squeezed and flexed, muscles she didn&#39;t know she had holding him inside her. And then he pulled out, and along with it the memory of her bullies, replaced with David&#39;s loving presence and strong arms.<br />
<br />
Junaita struggled with the thought, still a man in her memories.<br />
<br />
Another thrust, deeper, as though his cock were bigger, hitting every pleasure center as it slid in with a *pap*, and this time he stayed in thrusting lightly and shifting his cock around and her identity as a male, all her memories, scrambled. She moaned in confusion and held on to the only thing she had, David, her handsome rock in the storm. Her pussy remolded itself around the new cock, forming a powerful suction and with a *pop* it pulled free, her eyes rolling back in pleasure as the memories were suctioned out.<br />
<br />
Juanita was happy and comfortable with herself now, eager for him to paint her womb white. But a name, Chuck, kept insisting it was somehow male. It made her head throb as that last holdout of her old self fought.<br />
<br />
David&#39;s cock was unrelenting and with a *pap* he thrust so deep she was sure he&#39;d gotten past her cervix and...and she was sure if he pulled out now she&#39;d lose something very vital and her pussy clamped down on that perfectly thick cock and her walls massaged it and she felt it flex and she realized it was a mistake because..because...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, I&#39;m-!&quot; She gasped.<br />
<br />
“M-me too. You’re so tight!”<br />
<br />
Juanita reached out, toes curling, for something to hold on to for the oncoming orgasm and her hand fell on the Book. She wondered at it for a second, not sure what to do with it. She&#39;d felt his cock flex in her, it might already be too late. But then David pulled out and Chuck no longer existed and Juanita gave a quiet moan of relief, the tension in her head gone. As the relief washed through her David thurst into her one last time, impaling her on his glorious cock with a *pap* and she went over the edge, pussy spasming, the pleasure flowing through her in waves and she could feel David&#39;s cock begin to buck and her womb opened to welcome his seed.<br />
<br />
Her fingers slipped off the Book as she felt the warmth of he semen flood her. She gasped happily, pulling her husband into a kiss, feeling the last spasms of his cock as he filled her up. They lay in a happy tangle of limbs, he stroking her hair, she running a hand across his glorious pectorals.<br />
<br />
The Book of Body disappeared as he began to grind his still-turgid length into her once again.</p>
