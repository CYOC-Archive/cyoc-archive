<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelly started walking down the paving stones that lead to the sidewalk in front of their house, the throng of eighteen pairs of legs barely fitting on the paving stones, each and every footstep challenging Kelly&#39;s balance, the pin heel shoes making walking a challenge again. She now had to get used to walking with eighteen pairs of heels, all in different directions, her legs needing to move in different fashions than the shoes were made for. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that she had thirty six legs moving in pace like a starfish she would have tripped and twisted an ankle, she could feel the shoes lifting her feet, and making her push her asses inward, forcing her legs and hips to lift her up as tall as they possibly could. <br />
<br />
Kelly remembered a joke from a cartoon she had seen once, “I like the height the heels give me.” and audibly groaned. “Yeah, if only I still had my last torso.” Kelly looked down at her cleavage, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that the blouse she wore was practically always tailored for her body, it would have hidden the view, unfortunately her powers worked for her subconscious as well, and now she was wearing a tight v neck tank top, which lifted her bust and threatened a wardrobe malfunction if she so much as breathed to deep. With her torso returned to it&#39;s original male state, it had shortened by eight or so inches, leaving her cleavage crammed on a shorter, and less wide frame, which pressed her breasts closer together, even without her top, her breasts would still appear firmer than they actually were. Even without any clothing they would have support from the shelf made by her multitude of hips and legs, which now measured out a foot and a half away from her center.<br />
<br />
Every step caused the breasts to jiggle, she had gotten used to that, but now that it was in view, the virtual sea of tit flesh that filled half of her lower vision was getting distracting. As she walked down the sidewalk toward the convenience store she felt like she was being followed, but quickly dismissed that as her imagination, after all, she had thirty six heels clicking under her, still she couldn&#39;t shake that feeling, so she stopped, and heard the sound of tennis shoes shuffling behind her. <br />
<br />
“I can hear you back there, and I know there aren&#39;t a bunch of you, but that many feet?” Kelly sighed. “You&#39;re not Jarred, he&#39;s too busy fucking himself.” She heard a giggle, “You&#39;re not Alex, he&#39;s too busy learning how to skateboard with twelve legs.”<br />
<br />
“Skateboarding with twelve legs? Really?” The stranger said. Kelly turned herself around and finally saw who was following her.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Alex isn&#39;t as pervy as Jarred, and as you can see, Jarred got to me Jen.” <br />
<br />
“Well...” Jen suppressed her laughter “That&#39;s certainly a lot of mommy issues you have there.” She was practically crying.<br />
<br />
“Yeah... well I also cursed my mom.” <br />
<br />
“WHAT?” Jen looked furious “HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO...”<br />
<br />
“CALM DOWN! SHE KEPT SAYING WHAT SHE WOULDN&#39;T GIVE TO HAVE A BOY LIKE MINE AND I GAVE IT TO HER! THEN SHE PUNISHED ME FOR WHAT I&#39;VE DONE!” Jen cocked an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m listening.” Kelly paused for minute, then began.<br />
<br />
“So, Jarred first made my original body into a younger copy of my mom&#39;s, with these tits!” Kelly pointed down wildly, making Jen snort, “Then he gave me another set of six pairs of legs, and made it so I didn&#39;t need to go to school.”<br />
<br />
“Well that explains where you&#39;ve been. Wait, I&#39;m seeing... eighteen pairs? Where did the rest come from? And why do you have your old body if...”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m getting to that, so then I see Alex, so he removed my cocks and male legs, then rotated all of my legs so that they point outward, which honestly,” She waved around at her lower half, “A lot easier to walk with than having them point inward, and last I was given “magic clothing powers.”<br />
<br />
“Magic Clothing Powers?” Jen was about to lose it. “Like an anime girl?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.... So that actually makes it easier, I mean, I don&#39;t use the toilet, so no wasted time there, and now, I think of some clothes...” Kelly demonstrated by changing all of her Jeans to Short Shorts and back. “And I&#39;m dressed.”<br />
<br />
“That doesn&#39;t explain the heels or...”<br />
<br />
“So anyway, a few minutes ago, my mother once again was sighing jealously about the strange and sexy body I had, so I cursed her and gave her a copy, but I mistakenly told her about how I got that way, including the first curses I gave you. She cursed me back, took away my female torso, but made me keep the tits, gave me six more pairs!” She wave even more wildly, Jen started laughing hard, Kelly wasn&#39;t going for sympathy, but for a laugh. “And made it so that any shoes I conjure are a style of seven inch heels, and only seven inch heels. And she&#39;s sending me back to school.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it should be interesting seeing you get past dress code.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, she settled that, since they&#39;re the only shoes I can wear, the dress code won&#39;t affect me.”<br />
<br />
“Your mom thought of everything didn&#39;t she?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well...” Kelly hesitated. “Look, when I cursed you with that lying curse, I, the pervert that I was, was thinking of a weird way to punish you. For a simple and humiliating prank, and now look at us. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m an idiot, and now we are both freaks, as well as Jarred, Alex and my mom, and no one thinks the wiser.” Kelly reached out her hand, “Let&#39;s let bygones be bygones, I can&#39;t curse you now, even if I wanted to.”<br />
<br />
Jen stared at her, trying to figure out what she was doing, and reluctantly shook her hand. “Sure, fine. Still doesn&#39;t make me more comfortable, but fine.”<br />
<br />
“About that. My mom has the curse, and she wants to see you.”<br />
<br />
“Why? So she can make me more of a freak?”<br />
<br />
“She wants to fix this problem. I told her about the wording of my curse, I think she has a work around.” <br />
<br />
“Okay.....” Jen was skeptical. “You better not be lying.”<br />
<br />
“I swear on my tits!” Jen laughed. “I gotta go take care of an errand, wanna come with me? We&#39;ll go back to my house and see what mom has cooked up for this.”<br />
<br />
“Sure Kyle. Let&#39;s go.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it&#39;s Kelly now, not like I have many male parts now eh?”<br />
<br />
Jen and Kelly finished the shopping and went back to Kelly&#39;s house, talking as if they were old friends all along, entering the kitchen they found Kelly&#39;s mom starting dinner.<br />
<br />
“Oh! And this must be Jennifer Smith.” <br />
<br />
“Yes, that&#39;s me.” <br />
<br />
“Oh and look at you, poor thing, those asses are far too large for you to own right now, maybe when your older, but now? Well let&#39;s talk about this.” <br />
<br />
“Kelly said you might have a fix?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;ve been thinking, the curse she gave you stated you&#39;d have to keep what you have now, but it didn&#39;t say anything about changing it. What if I try to at least make those legs of your match you top half?” <br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know if that would work. The curse is kinda unpredictable.”<br />
<br />
“We could try, the worst that could happen is they all plump up and you get very curvy, or they could even out.”<br />
<br />
“Well...” Jen hesitated, “If they feel more like mine, instead of my families, I think I could handle being freaky.”<br />
<br />
“Okay then, when your ready.”<br />
<br />
“Ready.” <br />
<br />
“Transform or Dare.”</p>
