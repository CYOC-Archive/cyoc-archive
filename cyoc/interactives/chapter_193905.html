<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate finally finished her hair and make-up and came out to see how Kerry was going. She found him with his shirt off once more lifting a chair with one arm pumping up his muscles. “What are you doing? I thought you were dressed”<br />
<br />
“Oops sorry. I couldn’t help it. I can’t see my muscles with the shirt on”<br />
<br />
“Well hurry. The taxi will be here soon”<br />
<br />
Kerry was already putting the shirt back on. “You look ravishing by the way. I love what you have done with your hair”<br />
<br />
Kate had put a curl in her hair “I took inspiration from what you did with Tom’s hair”<br />
<br />
“Uh! Uh! Remember I’m Tom tonight. We can’t afford slip ups! Kerry has gone to the football with her husband”<br />
<br />
“Yes. I’m sorry dearest hubby” Kate said that with a grin on her face.<br />
<br />
Kerry was doing up the waistcoat after doing up his/her tie. He then put the jacket back on. Kate was impressed by the co-ordination. The tie matched the handkerchief and the colour of Kate’s dress. “Where did you find the handkerchief?”<br />
<br />
“It’s actually a pair of your knickers, carefully folded. The colour is just perfect”<br />
<br />
Kate was a bit taken aback. “My knickers?” She did have some plum colored knickers. “I hope they don’t get dislodged” ….. “Actually let me straighten that tie” That was when Kate noticed the make-up and the thinned out eyebrows. “Kerry! What have you done! You can’t wear make-up. Your making Tom look effeminate”<br />
<br />
“I had to hide the mole, and there was a mark on my neck” <br />
<br />
“And you have done something to his eyebrows”<br />
<br />
“They were too bushy”<br />
<br />
“No you can’t do this. I won’t have my husband looking like a gay boy. Get that make-up off and while you are at it take my panties out of your pocket. I won’t have it” Kate was quite annoyed.<br />
<br />
Kerry sensed how upset Kate was. He realized he had gone too far. He wouldn’t like it if Michael wore make-up. He removed the panties from his pocket and handed them to Kate, then went to the bathroom and removed the concealer. Kate supervised with a cross look on her face. She lectured Kerry. <br />
<br />
“Try and be masculine. You wouldn’t like it if Tom made your body look butch. You had him looking ultra-feminine. Try not to do anything that will embarrass him. Remember you are pretending to be a heterosexual man. Try and act like one. And mess up your hair. Tom never looks that neat” Kate did that herself mussing Kerry’s head.<br />
<br />
They were just in time for the taxi to arrive.<br />
<br />
.....<br />
The limousine took Bill Windsor and his party to the football ground. The president’s dinner was in one of the function rooms on the upper floor. Bill gave them each a lanyard to show to security. Tom had to stop when a guard wanted to search her handbag. The guard appeared to be looking over Tom’s body carefully. She was made to turn around slowly. Had there been some type of security scare? She half expected the security guard to frisk her, not that she could possibly be concealing anything under her tight leather skirt. She was eventually allowed to enter. <br />
<br />
Margie whispered to her “I hate how these security guards think that they are allowed to perve as much as they like. I was almost going to put him in line. You are very tolerant” Tom blushed once more as she realized the guards had not made Michael or Bill stop at all.<br />
<br />
They took an elevator up 3 levels and followed Bill to the function room. Another ticket check allowed them entry.<br />
<br />
They found a table for 8 on which 4 spots were reserved for ‘AGJ’ Tom followed Margie’s lead and put her handbag down on the table.<br />
A woman who clearly knew Bill came across and spoke to him. Michael and Tom were introduced as “Michael and Kerry, newly-weds and big Tiger fans”<br />
<br />
That was the first of many introductions. Too many for Tom to remember the names. At least half of the women present were wearing yellow and black outfits. That made Tom feel better. No-one else was dressed up like Margie.<br />
<br />
There was finger food and trays of drinks being passed around and Tom took a glass of white wine. That was what Kerry had said her knew taste buds would enjoy. She noticed Michael talking to one of the younger players whose leg was in a brace. She moved towards him and began listening into the conversation by Michael’s side. The player was explaining his injury. She noticed the player glance her way. His eyes lingered on her chest then went down to her waist legs before returning to her chest. <br />
<br />
Michael must have noticed what had got the players attention. He put his arm around Tom’s waist and said “This is my wife Kerry. She’s a big fan as well” Michael’s hand was firmly gripping her backside. He was making sure Nick knew that Kerry belonged to him</p>
