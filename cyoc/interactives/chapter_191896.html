<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the spasms stopped Jake supported himself with a hand on Nathan’s index finger, eyes barely able to focus, the heat and musk a mix of his and Nathan’s. His senses returned, somewhat, as he no longer had to focus on keeping the pre back, but it was far too late. Jake’s body was one large erogenous zone, slick and wet and reddening with his throbbing heat, pleasure sparking with every rhythmic surge, his body hard and long. <br />
<br />
The mental image was too much to bare for Jake, his mind flooded with images of him turning into a red rod between Nathan’s legs, pre pumping out of his mouth, resonating in ways he had hoped it wouldn’t. He shuddered, another rope of pre oozing out, as Nathan’s paw closed in around him, his world darkening, able to see through his eyes, his mental image of himself, and invasive thoughts from Nathan’s perspective and mental image. It was a confusing mess, but he managed to stop the enclosing paw, looking up to Nathan as Nathan looked down at him.<br />
<br />
Nathan loomed large, dominant, his face distorted with their united need, while little Jake looked so small and submissive, flustered with irresistible need. It was almost enough to make Nathan cum there and then, but he let his cock-friend catch himself and say one last thing.<br />
<br />
“My room,” Jake gurgled, spitting out pree, “on the bed, I wanna see myself in the floor-length mirror.” Nathan nodded and sped off, Jake’s protests lost to the feeling of himself bouncing. He has to pull a hair again, stopping Nathan in his tracks. “Use the towel in my night stand. Don’t get cum on my bed!”<br />
<br />
Nathan chuckled, patting his friend on the head as he rose from the couch.<br />
<br />
The ride was interesting. Jake tried to focus, his conscious screaming an admonishment that was lost between the view; of seeing the world from such a low and small angle, and the mental images that flooded their collective imagination. A whirlwind later and Nathan was wedging his furry body into position in front of the mirror, massaging his balls and the base of his cock. <br />
<br />
It was the first time either of them had seen each other in full, and it made them both breath a heavy breath of intense arousal. For a moment Nathan sat there, looking at the wall of fur topped my predatory canine eyes, overcome with a new, stranger realization. He looked badass, like a more lithe werewolf out on the hunt, his face having a cool confidence weaved into it. <br />
<br />
He had known of Jake’s furry side in secret for years, and felt so neutral on the topic that he hadn’t even told Jake. He wondered if Jake had secretly made him more of a fan, or if this appreciation was all him.<br />
<br />
Jake let out a heavy twitch, coughing out more pre. Jake steadied himself, so slick he was starting to gleam.<br />
<br />
“Jesus,” Nathan goaded, “You have a lot of this stuff.”<br />
<br />
“C’mon man,” Jake spluttered, as the paw brushed upwards. It spread out the pre, slicking his cock, and weathering Jake’s mental capacity uver a wave of pleasure. “Stop teasing and, just, you know…”<br />
<br />
“Touch you?” Nathan smiled, cupping his balls.<br />
<br />
“Get it over with.” Jake replied, looking away. He was becoming hyper aware of the moisture at the point, about the omnipresent slickness covering his reddened flesh, tight and impossibly smooth. He looked at his hand with a grumble, so red it distracted him from the burning tingling lust enveloping his body, so red it felt like he was glowing, but not for long. A moment later Jake was bathed in darkness, as Nathan rubbed over him again. <br />
<br />
“Cut it out,” Nathan said, wrapping his right paw around Jake’s waist, as he began to slide up and down, “I can see your stats on the ‘vac; you like this, you are feeling hony as hell.” Jake looked at his own horniness brought into focus on the chronivac, wondered why the screen suddenly looked so different, but his eyes fluttered away, the contact making him feel so good it was hard to keep up the pretense. There was still part of him that was feeling a great amount of shame about the situation, a vestigial voice begging Jake to stop, but it was much smaller than the throbbing lust and desperate need for relief. Jake said nothing, looking back at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Nathan was spread out, his legs far apart, with one hand rubbing around the base of his cock, the other supporting him on his thigh. It looked like he was posing, but it also made his control over the situation clear.<br />
<br />
“See,” Nathan said, “you like it.” <br />
<br />
“You cut it…” Jake started, but didn’t finish it. As Nathan began pushing his thumb up Jake&#39;s back Jake’s words failed him, and he fell back into a world of pleasure. Nathan watched as his friend shuddered and gasped, the little cat’s tiny fingers flexing as his body arched, now rigid.<br />
<br />
Nathan looked over the stats again, his heart in his throat he was that excited. He had just risked spoiling the whole thing by showing the stats, but showing him, taking that risk, and flexing that dominance was making him feel hornier than he had ever felt in his life. He had the sentient cock of his dreams, and had complete control over it, and could do whatever he wanted with it. Nathan looked at Jake’s dominance, licking his lips, wondering what else he could do.<br />
<br />
“No use pretending Jake,” Nathan said, thumbing through Jake’s stats and thumbing along the ridge of Jake’s back, the back of his cock, “I can see you want this as much as I do.” Jake bit his lip, trying hard to ignore the goading as Nathan pumped harder. “Just say you want it, say you need it, and give in.” Jake was infuriated by the demand, but he didn’t need to see his stats to know Nathan was right. He wanted it. He wanted it bad. “You don’t even have to say it, just give in, let this happen.”<br />
<br />
Jake was only able to think properly for a moment more, his mind putting the pieces together, before another wave of dark and musky heat overcame him, as Nathan brushed over his body again. Any chance to resist, and chance to stop it, or even just complain about the situation was lost, and he knew it. As Nathan started pumping, his firm grip rolling over Jake’s miniaturized body, the sexual lust and feeling of pleasure consuming every inch of his sensitive body. He was no longer even able to move, his whole body consumed with pleasure, his mind lost, seeing the anthro deer again flashing as the last image.<br />
<br />
Nathan was entranced. He watched the mental turmoil rise within his friend, watched the feeble act of resistance, and watched it all come to nothing the second he started pumping. Jake was his, maybe just for this moment, while they combined pleasure was overwhelming them, but there was no denying Jake was his.<br />
<br />
Masturbating little Jake was bizarre, but much more intensely pleasurable. Jake was a ministraing mess, moving in his hand like he was getting fucked, adding to the feeling over power, and making it feel more like sex. The general sensitivity of a cock merged with the “good” spots on a cat too, and every time his fingers brushed the side of Jake’s face, or the base of his back, it sent an intense shudder of relaxing pleasure through them both. It felt unique to any pleasure he had experienced, but better than any he could have imagined, so much so he wasn’t satisfied just letrting it happen incidentally.<br />
<br />
Nathan shuffled on the bed, slowing down and letting Jake catch a mock-breath, his eyes fluttering open. Jake wondered itf it was over, but knew it wasn’t, and then felt a wave of shame as he realized he wasn’t yet satisfied, that he wanted more. He didn’t have a chance to reflect upon it long, as the pumping started again, this time low on his body, coming no higher than his chest, Nathan’s thumb firm as it rubbed his back, while Nathan’s free hand came to his face. Awkward as the position was, this new hold, this new multi-levelled, multi-targeted maturbation overwhelmed him, overwhelmed them both, the two of them now staring at each other through the mirror again.<br />
<br />
Jake couldn’t believe what he was looking at, his friend, in the form of a dog-like furry, his hands manipulating a tiny semi-human creature between his legs, while it moaned like a whore, transparent liquid leaking from it&#39;s mouth. He was fucking it, fucking him, and…<br />
<br />
It felt hot. There was an intense utingle, almost like an itch flowing down Jacke’s throat, warning him it was on the way, the pressure at the base arriving fast and no longer within his control. He was greedy for it, he wanted it more than anything, so he just let it out, squeezing it out with a fluttering moan. The hot thick spunk came out in waves, flying across the floor, Jake witching while Nathan grunted. <br />
<br />
After the first one Jake thought it should be over, but it wasn’t, not even remotely. “Oh god.” he gargled, as he spewed out another, then another. “Fuck,” he said to to the fourth, the flow decreasing, crying as the fifth dribbled out. A sex-drunk Nathan didn’t notice, was too busy panting, and grasping at the bed.<br />
<br />
Nathan flopped back into bed, the dark deed finally done, lust cleared from his mind, and his senses restored. As he started slipping into sleep the reality of what he just did washed over him, that he just tricked his friend into fucking him, if you could even call it that, and he found that hot in onto itself. He felt a pang of guilt, as his exhaustion pulled him into a deep sleep.</p>
