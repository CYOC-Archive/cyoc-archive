<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Within an hour or two of having started Ty and his camouflaged lizard friend had finished cleaning the yard, in no small part thanks to the reptile&#39;s incredible strength and endurance.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Narissa had refused any more questions until they were done.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think I could have done this without you.” Ty said happily, surveying the job they had done and wiping the sweat from his brow.<br />
<br />
“No, you couldn&#39;t have.” Narissa nudged his side playfully. “But you&#39;re welcome.”<br />
<br />
“So... what now?” Ty finally asked. He stared at the girl/lizard beside him with a deep uncertainty and a little nervousness. She could clearly feel his emotions as well as see his mind, as she took his hand gently in hers and offered a gentle and heartfelt embrace.<br />
<br />
“Well, your chores are done.” Narissa smiled. “I think the world can go another day without saving itself, so why don&#39;t we just take it easy for now and you let me take care of you? That sound good?”<br />
<br />
“It... really does.” Ty let out a deep sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
“Let&#39;s go back in for a bit. I want to be me for a while.” Narissa smirked.<br />
<br />
The moment the two were back indoors, the lizard woman blinked back from her human disguise and stood once more to her full 7&#39;2” next to Ty.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s so weird.” Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Narissa said with mock surprise, gently taking Ty&#39;s hand once more in hers and leading him from the back door to the stairs leading up to his room. “You mean you&#39;re not used to this yet?”<br />
<br />
“No, I don&#39;t think so.” Ty laughed. “I mean, just moments ago you were my size and species. Now you&#39;re back to this big reptile thing.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t like me this way. I know better.” She winked, giggling as Ty went red and slapped her hand away.<br />
<br />
“No, you know what&#39;s even better?” She said excitedly. “I haven&#39;t done this one yet.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, God.” Ty winced.<br />
<br />
“Watch this!” Narissa said enthusiastically, and blinked entirely away, leaving an empty space where she had been standing. Ty reeled back in shock, feeling nothing of the lizard, even in his mind, and was equally shocked as she appeared in the middle of the kitchen several feet away from the stairs, leaning against the counter with a huge toothy grin.<br />
<br />
“What...” Ty stared, and realization crept in. “You can teleport?!”<br />
<br />
“Well, really, what I&#39;m doing...” She blinked out again, and then reappeared down in the living room triumphantly. “...Is flipping back into my dimension and then placing myself elsewhere into yours. Normally we can&#39;t do this with such precision.”<br />
<br />
Ty left the stairs and approached the lizard with curiosity. “That&#39;s... amazing! How can you do it differently, then?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I can sense where you are at all times.” She explained, smiling smugly as Ty sat down on the couch and listened. “So I can phase out and then phase back in with you as my sort of dimensional sign post.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s awesome!” Ty laughed. “So normally, you wouldn&#39;t really know where you were going?”<br />
<br />
“No, not quite. You have to sort of guess at it.” She shrugged slightly and then walked to the couch to sit down next to the human, putting her arm over the back of the cushion and relaxing. “And remember, we&#39;re not supposed to that anyway, you gave me special permission. So I can travel back and forth as I please.”<br />
<br />
“Like...” She blinked away, leaving Ty excitedly staring around the room.<br />
<br />
“This.” Narissa returned, only straddling Ty&#39;s body with her upper torso and kneeling against the couch to put the tip of her snout just inches from his face.<br />
<br />
Face to face with the reptile, Ty stared deeply into her yellow eyes and long dark eyelashes. She blinked gently, her snout pulling into a smile. “So wherever you are, I can be with you.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Ty whispered, staying very still.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Narissa read his thoughts and smiled. “You can touch. I won&#39;t bite.”<br />
<br />
Ty raised his hand gently and placed his palm on the side of the reptile&#39;s cheek. Or rather part of her snout. It was smooth and glossy, just slightly cool to his touch, and beneath it he could feel strange pulsations as she breathed evenly. “This is amazing.” Ty blushed. “You&#39;re amazing.”<br />
<br />
“So are you.” She replied sweetly, lowering her voice to a soft whisper. Her tail had begun swaying slowly behind her once again. “You just don&#39;t know it yet. But we&#39;ll get there soon.”<br />
<br />
To Ty&#39;s surprise, Narissa raised her own hand from the couch at his side and placed it over his, slowly and very sensually stroking his hand. She stared into his eyes, blinked once or twice, and mischief began to play with her expression.<br />
<br />
“You can do that too.” She offered, sweetly, softly. “But not much more than that, okay?”<br />
<br />
Ty blushed deep red. “For real?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I&#39;ll give you a freebie.” She laughed. “Now are you kissing me, or what?”<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s face went beat red and he began trembling once more, pulling his legs in to the couch to make himself smaller to the lizard and sweating profusely. “I&#39;ve never even kissed a girl.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll want a human girl after me. I&#39;ll spoil you.” Narissa bragged, offering a genuine and almost childish giggle. “Come on, lad, I want to see some courage. You want to do it, I can see you want to do it, I can feel it, and I want you to. Man up and fucking kiss me!”<br />
<br />
Ty grinned widely, steeled his nerves, and carefully lunged forward. He could feel Narissa&#39;s warm and now more excited breath on the top of his face as his lips struck the front of her snout. She pursed her own lips, the strange scales around her mouth, and before Ty knew it he had a large reptilian hand on the back of his head, urging him to go for it. Closing his eyes, Ty gave the lizardess a slow and gentle kiss, clumsy at first, but growing more confident as he held him close. When they finally drew away, he could see the utter delight and profound joy on her face, her yellow eyes twinkling.<br />
<br />
“Well.” Narissa said, kneeling back on her haunches from the couch and then standing with the balance of her tail. “We know you&#39;re brave now.” Although Ty could swear the area around her eyes and the back of her jaw had turned a distinct and vividly teal colour.<br />
<br />
Flush with raw emotion and a little bit more than pride, Ty chuckled madly and drank in the lingering sensations of Narissa&#39;s lips, the cool and perfectly glassy texture of them, the muscle behind them, the scent of her leathery flesh and the feel of her warm and cleanly scented breath.<br />
<br />
“Can&#39;t stand up, can you?” She cocked her head slyly.<br />
<br />
“No, ma&#39;am.” Ty blushed, laughing even harder.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s all right. I have that effect on men.” She laughed playfully. <br />
<br />
“Why the hell would you let me do that?” He queried, still blushing. &quot;That didn&#39;t help anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Taste for later.” She said with a grin, and flipped back into her human visage. “Come on, we&#39;ve got stuff to go do.”</p>
