**********************************************************************************************************************<br />
Cindy yawned and woke up early.  For some reason she was really hungry.  She wanted to go the cafeteria, but she was waiting for the other girls in her cabin to leave.  She still planned to remain unseen and unnoticed for the whole camp.  It was better than being noticed and teased.  It wasn&#39;t hard.  Small kids were rarely seen and could easily blend in with the background.  So she was a little surprised when two girls came up to talk to her while she sat on her bunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, my name is Sarah, and this is Micah, &quot; said the tall blonde girl.  &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cindy, &quot; she replied glumly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Cindy, don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but are you sure you are in the right cabin?  You look a little ...... young,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 15,&quot; said Cindy quietly.  Here it goes again, she thought.  In just a few more minutes she would have been all alone.  But these two girls just had to remain behind and bother her.  She waited for the inevitable humiliation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, &quot; said Sarah softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.  Happens all the time, &quot; said Cindy, as she stood up and tried to walk by the two girls.  Sometimes the pity could feel worse than the teasing.  She just wanted to disappear into the cafeteria and satisfy her gnawing hunger.  But Micah, the tall dark skinned girl, punched Sarah in the arm, and then ran to catch up to Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What my friend meant to say was &#39;Welcome to camp.&#39; Would you like to have breakfast with us?&quot; said Micah.<br />
<br />
Cindy was surprised.  These girls were really attractive.  They would put the popular girls at her school back home to shame.  And they wanted to eat with her?  She was just a short underdeveloped little dweeb.  &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s the least I can do to make up for my mistake.  I mean, I know how it feels to be mistaken for a little kid.  I used to be really short, too, &quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
Cindy looked up at the tall blonde in shock. She looked like she was around 5&#39;9&quot;.  It was hard for her to imagine this beautiful giant ever being small.  &quot;Really?&quot; asked Cindy again.<br />
<br />
Micah smiled.  &quot;Yep, she used to be the camp runt.  Then one summer she just took off.  Grew several inches in just a few months.  Almost gave me a run for my money, &quot; said the leggy Micah.  Micah was a couple of inches taller, and had a muscular fit physique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!  I keep hoping to have a growth spurt like that, &quot; said Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you will.  I have seen a lot of kids shoot up around here.  The rumor is that there is something in the water.  That&#39;s why I keep coming back.  I am always looking to add a few more inches,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming back?  How old are you?&quot; asked Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seventeen.  I have been coming here for three years,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
Cindy was once again shocked.  Not only was Sarah tall, but she was also well developed.  She could have easily passed herself off as someone in their early twenties, or even a counselor.  &quot;And you grew every summer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah sighed.  &quot;Well, not this summer.  It looks like I might have peaked.  But that&#39;s okay.  I am happy with my size now. And you have several more years to grow.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  Who knows?  This may be your lucky summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, &quot; said Cindy with excitement.  These two girls had filled her with hope. She already felt taller.  Her clothes even felt a little tighter, but it may have been her imagination.<br />
<br />
Micah smiled.  &quot;Whoa, easy there, tiger. Don&#39;t get your hopes up too much kid.  The water thing is just a rumor.  Most of the kids stay the same.  But don&#39;t worry about it either way.  Just stick with Sarah and me. We will look out for you and show you the ropes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, thanks, &quot; said Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem.  You seem pretty cool.  I think this will be a good summer for everyone.  Now let&#39;s get some grub.  I&#39;m starving,&quot; said Micah as she patted Cindy on the back.  Cindy&#39;s stomach growled in response.  They all laughed and headed into the cafeteria together.<br />
<br />
**********************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Mandy yawned and slowly woke up.  She would have slept longer - she wanted to sleep longer but the brats in her cabin were making too much noise.  She looked around the room and saw the campers changing into their swimsuits.  She noted with some amusement that they ducked their heads and avoided her gaze when she looked at them.  But she needed some answers.  She grabbed one of the girls by the arm when she walked by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on, shrimp?&quot; asked Mandy.<br />
<br />
The girl looked at her nervously.  &quot;It&#39;s time for swim class. We gotta go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about breakfast?&quot; asked Mandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We ate a couple hour ago, &quot; said the girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you wake me?&quot; asked Mandy angrily.<br />
<br />
The girl gulped.  &quot;You were sleeping, and no one wanted to wake you.  We figured you would get mad, and that if you were really hungry you would wake up by yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy realized she didn&#39;t feel hungry.  Usually she ate a big breakfast, but today she felt full. So she was happy her fellow campers let her sleep.  &quot;Okay, scram, &quot; said Mandy, letting go of the girl&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to come with us?&quot; asked the girl nervously.  In truth, she hoped the big bully would stay in the cabin and leave them all alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah.  I got better stuff to do, &quot; said Mandy, as she lay down I bed.  She felt a little tired, and thought she might get some more sleep.  But instead, she pulled out her phone.  After sending a few text messages to her friends, she popped in her ear buds and lay back down to sleep while listening to some tunes.<br />
<br />
She was rudely awoken by Miss Smith, one of the camp counselors.  &quot;Mandy!  What are you doing still in here?  Why aren&#39;t you with the other girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy looked up at the tall woman and glared at her.  &quot;I already know how to swim.  I don&#39;t need to take any stupid classes. That stuff is for little kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Smith glared right back down at her.  This girl was going to be a handful.  &quot;That may be well and good, but you need your exercise young lady.  It helps speed up your metabolism and gets the blood flowing.  You will not waste your summer in bed.  Now get up right now and get changed.  And this is strictly forbidden, &quot; said Miss Smith, as she grabbed Mandy&#39;s phone and slipped it into her pocket.<br />
<br />
Mandy stood up.  &quot;Hey!  That&#39;s mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you will get it back at the end of summer.  Now  march, young lady!  Or do I have to dress you myself!&quot; said Miss Smith, as she grabbed Mandy roughly by the arm.<br />
<br />
Mandy shook her arm and free, and walked away. &quot;Whatever, &quot; she said under her breath, as she picked up her bathing suit and walked into the bathroom.  She was getting really fed up with Miss Smith.  She was treating her like a little kid, bossing her around.  She was going to give this place a really bad online review.  <br />
<br />
Miss Smith sighed.  The young girl was acting more like a teenager than a pre-teen.  It had to be the hormones.  She hoped that Dr. Johnson&#39;s treatment would help her mellow out a little and act a little more like a girl her age. <br />
<br />
**********************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Cindy surprised the other girls by eating two servings of food. And she still had room for the nutritional shake that Miss Smith brought for her to drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, girl.  You don&#39;t just act like a tiger, you eat like one, too, &quot; said Micah, earning Cindy her new nickname.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I am having a growth spurt, &quot; said Cindy through mouthfuls of food.<br />
<br />
Micah laughed, but Sarah looked deadly serious.  &quot;Don&#39;t laugh.  She may be right.  The same thing happened to me last summer.  We need to get a ruler and measure you later.  We can keep track of it over the summer. It will be fun, &quot; said Sarah cheerfully.<br />
<br />
Cindy wasn&#39;t too happy about it, but she agreed to do it.  If she stayed small, she would be very disappointed.  But the girls had given her hope, and they seemed really nice.  She didn&#39;t want to disappoint them.  <br />
 <br />
&quot;Okay, enough chat.  I am ready for some exercise.  Anybody up for some hoops? &quot; asked Micah.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Micah looked at Cindy and waited for her answer.  Normally, she hated sports, especially basketball.  She was just too short to be any good.  But today she felt strangely energetic and confident.  It was probably because of her new friends.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Count me in, &quot; said Cindy with a smile.<br />
<br />
They all three happily walked to the court. <br />
<br />
**********************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Mandy sat sunning herself next to the other children while they swam.  That counselor could force her out of the cabin, but she couldn&#39;t make her swim.  She decided to get a nice sun tan instead.  She wore her best two piece string bikini, trying to highlight the small, few curves she had.  A little padding helped a lot.  <br />
<br />
One of the kids stood in front of her, blocking her sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; she asked angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to play with us?&quot; she asked sweetly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, go away, &quot; said Mandy, trying to rudely dismiss the child.  But it had the opposite of her desired effect.  A second curious girl joined the first and stood beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a pretty bathing suit.  I haven&#39;t seen one like that before. Well, expect on older kids like my sister,&quot; said the second girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am older.  I am seventeen,&quot; said Mandy angrily.<br />
<br />
Both of the girls looked at each other in shock, then started to laugh.  &quot;That  was funny.  You&#39;re funny.  My name is Abby and this is Gwen.  What&#39;s your name?  Do you want to be our friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Mandy, and sure, I&#39;ll be your friend.  But the first thing I want my friends to do is go away and leave me alone.  I&#39;m trying to tan,&quot; said Mandy.  <br />
<br />
A third shadow fell over her. She looked up and saw another girl had joined the other two.  She was a couple of inches taller than the other two, with short very dark black hair.<br />
<br />
Mandy sighed.  &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you really?&quot; asked the dark haired girl.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you.  I am seventeen.  Now scram,&quot; said Mandy angrily.<br />
<br />
The girl put her hands on her hips.  &quot;No way.  You can&#39;t be seventeen.  You are too short.  You have to be a liar.  Unless you are some kind of dwarf or midget or something,&quot; said the girl sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Mandy stood up.  She had enough of that.  Being called a liar and a midget?  It was too much.  She had to teach this girl a lesson, and establish her role as the dominant one.  &quot;That was very rude, and I will have to punish you.  I will teach you to treat your elders with respect,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
The girl tried to run away, but Mandy grabbed her arm and pulled her back.  She sat her across her knee and spanked her.  When she was finished, the girl glared at her angrily, trying to hide her tears.  The other girls comforted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Melissa.  We&#39;ll help you, &quot; said Abby to the dark haired girl, as they walked away.<br />
<br />
Mandy smiled and laid down to continue her tanning.  She had no idea she had just made an enemy.  She was just happy to have some peace and quiet while she soaked up the sun alone.  The only thing that bothered her was her bathing suit.  It felt a little loose. <br />
<br />
Well, I guess that is one good thing about missing breakfast.  It looks like I lost a little weight, thought Mandy.  Who knows?   I might even lose a little more before I leave camp.</p>
