<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke began by grabbing his phone and trying to remember his Uncle’s phone number. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a problem. “Yuck! What’s that smell?” Luke questioned holding his nose with his fingers. It only took a second for him to realize it was coming from him.<br />
<br />
All the shivering from the night before had caused him to break out in a cold sweat which meant: BO. His age seemed to be at the part where his hormones had begun to act up and release stronger odors. Annoyed at his body’s lack of control, Luke realized that with his wet dreams and body odor that he was really had just begun on the path toward puberty. But Luke was 18! He had already gone through it once and he definitely didn’t need to go through the awful experience of puberty twice.<br />
<br />
Realizing that the smell was too overwhelming, Luke decided to shower first and call his Uncle Second. He grabbed a bath towel and wrapped it around his waist before he headed into the shower next to his room. As he entered he took notice of his reflection which he could make our much better in the full length mirror placed in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
A young boy of 12 stared back at him with pale skin and dark brown hair. He stood at around five foot a stark contrast to his previous height of 6’ 2”. “Damn! I really knew that growth spurt again.” He said. Luke took notice of how different he looked now compared to yesterday when he had taken a shower. Luke hadn’t been the most muscular teenager, since he only did track, but he did have an average six pack and some resemblance of muscles on his arms and especially his legs. In addition, he had developed a nice tan over the time he spent outdoors making himself look less like a ghost with his pale skin.<br />
<br />
However it was like he had returned right back to when he had reinvented himself. When he hated his body and his body hated him, forcing him to go through the turmoils of puberty. Luke took notice of his face to see no resemblance of facial hair, not even the stubble he would have to occasionally shave, and felt his face- yep as smooth as a baby’s bottom.<br />
<br />
Looking at the rest of his body was worse. Luke could already tell he he was less stronger and fit that he previously was but looking at his body’s reflection confirmed it. He wasn’t fat per se but he did have a soft layer of “baby fat” he would call it over him giving him a more pudgy and young appearance. Luke looked wistfully at his missing six pack now replaced by a flat chest and a small tummy.<br />
<br />
His arms and legs as expected were also the same, being more pudgy that he remembered. But it was the lack of body hair that really grabbed his attention. Not even peach fuzz covered his mostly naked body devoid of body hair. His arms and legs barely had any now and he didn’t even expect to find anywhere else on his body. <br />
<br />
Luke only had to look at his dick once before he wanted to move on. The now bare dick was so small it was kinda embarrassing to remember how much longer it had gotten when he became older. It was standing at 2-inches flaccid and he could feel his much smaller proportional balls hanging closer to his dick, clearly in the process of dropping.<br />
<br />
Luke had had enough and hopped in the shower where he quickly made sure to scrub himself clean. Easier done when he didn’t have to wash any body hair and when he was had less body mass to wash on account of his new height.<br />
<br />
Luke stepped out and dried himself before wrapping his towel and heading into his room. There he walked over to his dressers and found clothes more befitting of his age. Some white briefs, which he hastily put on, and some jeans and a striped t-shirt. After he had gotten ready he went downstairs to join his parents for breakfast.<br />
<br />
As he sat down to join them he realized how similar dining with them felt almost as if he was 18 again. His parents and surroundings all still looked the same. Except now he was 12 again, a boy on the verge of puberty and becoming a teenager.<br />
<br />
Luke quickly scarfed down his breakfast feeling hungrier than he remembered ever being and asked his Dad a question. “Hey do you know Uncle John’s phone number?” <br />
<br />
His dad looked at him before saying…</p>
