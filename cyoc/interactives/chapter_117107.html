<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty wished that the boys in Gym would grow an inch each minute they were in the sun, and that their balls would increase in size 1.5x each minute as well. He then wished himself and Dustin invisible and teleported them both just behind the track, where the gym class would be playing today.<br />
<br />
Luke and Sean were all talking together as they headed out to the track. Although they all had to workout, it wasn&#39;t hard, and the friends could stay together and talk the whole time. They chose to go to the jump roping station, which was located on one corner of the field.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Sean, stop bragging, I know that you think you can jump the most!&quot; said Luke. &quot;Fine, let&#39;s prove it in a race!&quot; Sean retorted.<br />
<br />
As they started jumping, Luke felt a tingling in his penis and balls, and then felt a bit bigger down there. However, he dismissed it as being a trick in his mind. After all, he had hoped for something like this to happen for a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah! I&#39;m beating you!&quot; Sean shouted to Luke. &quot;BOYS, STOP RACING&quot; shouted the gym coach. &quot;Fuck, oh well&quot; Sean stopped, and Luke followed suit. They sat down and started talking.<br />
<br />
Another minute passed. Luke felt another tingling, and then felt bigger down there as well! By this time, he and his peers on the field had already added 2 inches to their size and their balls had already doubled their size. When he looked down, he saw a bigger bulge. Was it my imagination? He thought silently, but he kept talking with Sean. He did, however, notice that Sean was stealing looks at both his own and Luke&#39;s bulge.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile from far away, Ty was getting impatient. It was fun and all to see this happening, but he wanted it faster. He doubled the rate of growth to an inch every 30 seconds, and the balls would now double in size every minute.<br />
<br />
Again, a minute passed. This time, Luke actually saw the growth occur as what looked like a hot dog started to show itself inside his gym shorts. At 7 inches soft, Luke&#39;s underwear was starting to feel tight. Sean wasn&#39;t faring well either, as his now almost 9 inch soft dick was curled up inside his boxers. It created a salami bulge that almost ran down his left leg. Both were visible.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Sean couldn&#39;t take it anymore. &quot;Dude, I think our dicks are growing!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I know, I noticed this time! Holy crap it&#39;s huge now!&quot; Luke excitedly whispered, &quot;Do you think anyone else is affected?&quot;<br />
<br />
They both looked around. Everything seemed normal, until they looked closer.<br />
<br />
Jimmy was having trouble running around with his friend Evan. Upon closer look, it became no surprise, especially since Jimmy&#39;s 9 inch soft cock could be seen clearly through the thin gym shorts he was wearing. It was also very thick, and Jimmy was thrown off by it&#39;s new weight.<br />
<br />
Evan wasn&#39;t far behind at 8 inches soft now. He was having an even harder time because he wore actual underwear. That meant it had nowhere to go, and was curling up at the front, resulting in quite the bulge. It wasn&#39;t an exaggeration to say he could be stuffing a swimsuit down his pants.<br />
<br />
Oh crap, it&#39;s happening again! Luke thought as he felt the tingle again. It was even more obvious this time, if that were possible. Luke&#39;s 8 inch softie was now pretty tight in his underwear, and it was definitely more defined. But holy crap, Sean&#39;s almost 10 inch soft dick blew away any and all to come. It was thicker and also totally visible in his shorts.<br />
<br />
Across the field, Jimmy let out a yelp as his growing 10 inch softie was pinched by his clothes. Evan&#39;s front bulge almost doubled in size, and he let out a groan. Whether said groan was out of pleasure or pain, it wasn&#39;t known, but the reason was incredibly obvious.<br />
<br />
Jesus! Luke thought, this is a bit much. Wait a minute. Will it ever stop? Oh shit! He looked at Sean, and he could tell Sean was starting to worry. &quot;Dude&quot; Sean said, &quot;I love having a bigger cock, but will it ever stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know... I hope so&quot; Luke replied, watching his cock with fascination. Suddenly, it tingled and grew another inch. Luke saw the same thing happen to Sean and guessed that it had also happened to the other boys on the field. He noticed that none of the boys were actually playing on the field anymore, they had all come to the sidelines. Probably to rearrange everything down there, he thought.<br />
<br />
And then his dick tingled. AGAIN?? He thought but it was too late. His dick grew another inch, and this time his balls doubled in size. Luke had quite the bulge now at 10 long soft inches. He couldn&#39;t take it anymore and pulled his gym shorts open to try and rearrange everything down there. He saw Sean watching and then doing the same thing, but even so he couldn&#39;t help but gasp when Sean pulled out his cock.<br />
<br />
Sean had already been blessed before Ty had wished, and that blessing was turning into a curse. At a full foot long and several inches thick, Sean&#39;s cock absolutely amazed Luke, and he kept staring at the now HUGE bulge in Sean&#39;s shorts.<br />
<br />
Across the field, Jimmy and Evan were doubled over in pain. Their cocks were amazing, both of them around a foot long. They saw that Luke and Sean were having the same problem, and ran over to join them. Amazingly, the teacher was not affected and didn&#39;t seem to care (Ty had taken care of that problem).<br />
<br />
And speaking of problems... his dick tingled again. Luke was about to get his wish of being more like Sean. At 11 inches soft, he just couldn&#39;t take it anymore and took off his gym shorts and underwear, and then put his gym shorts back on. He felt that commando was a good idea considering the situation. Sean thought the same thing, and Jimmy and Evan caught on. In seconds, the four boys were all commando in shorts, and their penises hung straight down one of the legs. None of the boys had anything close to modest going on. Each one had a cucumber and two oranges in their shorts, and both were clearly outlined.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on! Will it ever stop?&quot; Jimmy asked. Evan nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, and the gym teacher doesn&#39;t care&quot; Sean responded.<br />
<br />
The boys decide to...</p>
