<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony went to the showers and started to get undressed, he was feeling pretty low about his preformance during batting practice, so much that he didnt notice that
<br>
 his abs were a bit on the fleshy side and a small but evident roll had developed over his waist area. Tony began to soap him self down and the hot water was both
<br>
 sothing and now theraputical to him, that he put the whole thing behind him and just enjoyed how good the shower felt.Tony finished his shaower and dryed off, he
<br>
 wraped his towel around his waist and headed for his locker, Todd the teams practice pitcher was walking behind Tony as they left the shower area, Todd couldnt
<br>
 help but notice that Tonys obliquics looked more like love handles on the younger Tony, &quot;Hey Tony, dont take this wrong or any thing man, I mean Im not the type
<br>
 of guy who checks guys bodys out or nothin but when ya start to get out of shape like that it sort of just sticks out dude.&quot; &quot;What are you talkin about dude whats
<br>
 outa shape on this bod dude?&quot; Tony said with a smile on his face as raised his arms in the air and turned all the way around showing off his still pretty nice looking
<br>
 body, with his arms raised his stomach hardly showed, but when he put them back down a small but obvious roll of fat rested over his tight towel. &quot;Yea dude, and
<br>
 whats this your lunch pouch?&quot; Todd said as he patted the fleshy mound that hung there. Tony whinced as his flab reverberated Todd slab all the way to Tonys
<br>
 diaphram knocking a little wins out of him, Tony looked down and for the frist time he noticed it &quot;Ah hell I just ate to much for breakfast thats all.&quot; Tony said
<br>
 knowing that he didnt have breakfast this morning and he was actully hungy. They both went to their lockers to get dressed,the locker room had two long rows of
<br>
 lockers on each side of the room with two equaly long benches down the middle of the room, tonys was on one side of the room and Todds was almost directly
<br>
 oppisit from Tonys, Tony put on his underwear and then his jeans the waist line seemed a little tight and Tony couldnt help it and looked down at the small roll of
<br>
 fatty flesh that hung slightly over his jean he also noticed that they didnt fit as tightly aroud his legs and ass area. Tony quickly threw on a button down shirt that
<br>
 would help hide his new gut and tucked it in to fill out his ass area better but left it alittle less tucked in around the frnot of his jeans, it seemed to do the trick of
<br>
 hiding it quite well. Todd was busy getting dressed still when Tony sat down to put his socks and boots on, Todd was still standing and turned to say something to
<br>
 Tony andnoticed that Tonys still damp head of hair had a small but visible little bald spot with the hair around it thinning a bit,&quot;Must run in the family aye Tony?&quot;
<br>
 Tod said looking at the spot, &quot;What runs in the family? what are talking about?&quot; Tony asked while he tied up his boot. &quot;Baldness dude I bet your old mans a
<br>
 chrome dome aye?&quot; Todd said as he sat down to put his own shoes on. &quot;baldness no way dude my dads hair as thick as a good green lawn man!&quot; Tony said as he
<br>
 subconiously rubed his hand through his hair, &quot;Well then its from your mothers side then dude, cause your loosing yours my freand.&quot; Todd said as he finished
<br>
 putting on his shoes and got up to leave, &quot;Hey Tony&quot; Todd said turning around to look Tony in the face, &quot;Try that Rogain stuff dude its supposed to work pretty
<br>
 good dude.&quot; Todd said with a honest supportive tone, and turned and left. 
<br>

<br>
 Tony was taken back by what Todd had said, after all they were good freands and Todd wouldnt joke about something like that, Tony quickly finished tieing his
<br>
 boots and practically ran to the mirror, Tony ran his comb through his hair and noticed that his hair line looked like it might be receading a bit, he finished combing
<br>
 his hair and his comb was full of hair,&quot;DAMN I AM LOOSING MY HAIR!&quot; Tony said almost in shock. Tony went to his locker and grabed his baseball hat and
<br>
 put it on he was feeling a bit self consiuos now. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean was waiting for him to come out of the gym, he wanted to see if there was any changes, if there was it didnt show that much exept for the fact that he was
<br>
 wearing his baseball cap. Sean decided that he better not miss his next class and headed out to the campus area, when he got there he saw Dave sitting on one of
<br>
 the benches between the buildings, he was talking to his girl freand who seemed to be consoling him, Sean dashed behide the bushes that were behind the two and
<br>
 got close enough to hear their conversation, &quot;I tell you cindy its not my imagination! I think Im loosing weight too I mean I know these are relaxed fitting jeans but
<br>
 there not supposed to be this baggy!&quot; Dave saud as he pulled on the excess fabric of his jeans. Sean noticed some thing else looked funny about Dave as well, his
<br>
 hands and his head hadent shrunk with the rest of him and almost looked comical on him he was beginng to look more like a dwarf, than the stud he was this
<br>
 morning, Sean did some quick math in his head and figuresd that he was 5 inches shorter than this morning, he was 5'5ins now. 
<br>

<br>
 Mean while back at Seans place Jay was just wakeing up he seemed to have the worst headache he'd had in long time, he also noticed that he wasent alone in his
<br>
 bed, he looked over and saw a skinny bony back, with the vertarae clearly visable, 'man I must have been drunk this girls the skinnyest bitch I ever laid.' Jay
<br>
 thought he didnt want to wake her so he tried to get out of bed quietly, Jays curtains were drawn shut so his room was still pretty dark, Jay bought back curtains so
<br>
 he could sleep late on the weekends, Jay swung his legs over the side of his bed and noticed that he was still dressed in jeans but they seemed way to big on him
<br>
 though and his feet didnt touch the floor, his head hurt so bad that he just slipped the rest of the way to the floor and stood up, when he did his jeans and
<br>
 underwear fell around his knees, so he reached down in the dimly lit room and went to pull them up, they were soaked! Jay quickly pulled up just the soaked
<br>
 underwear and steped out of the big wet jeans,'how the hell did these get so wet' Jay thought as he walked toward his bathroom holding up the oversized briefs,
<br>
 Jays bathroom had a sink area with a mirror and another small room with a tube and the toilet in it, Jay had to piss like a racehorse so he didnt bother to turn on the
<br>
 light his eyes were ajusted enough for him to find the camode in the dim light of his john. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark had been awaken by Jay getting up and was sitting up in the bed holding his hand to his head he also had a hugh hangover, he had no idea of where he was
<br>
 he still wasent fully awake yet, but his chin was itchy as hell so he went to scrath it, when he did he didnt feel his goatee, or for that matter his mustach either. He
<br>
 began to trie to tie up all the loose ends from the nite before, was he at some girls house where she obviously shaved his goatee and his preseous mustash off, 'Man
<br>
 I had to be fucked up to let some bitch shave my face!' he thought angry at himself for letting it happen, &quot;no more tequila for me!&quot; he said in a wisper. His balls also
<br>
 itched and he went to scratch them, he noticed that he was still dressed but the clothes felt loose as hell around his waist and that they were all wet, he could smell
<br>
 what he thought was an ammonia smell as well and quickly put two andtwo together shit I pissed my self I really must have been drunk. Mark looked around the
<br>
 room for the girl he'd slept with but no one was there, but he could hear the distinct sound of a guy pissing in the toilet. &quot;Oh god! I SLEPT WITH A GUY!&quot; Mark
<br>
 said out loud, his voice sounded higher to him so he tried to clear his throat, 'I gotta get out of here and quick!' Mark thought as he quickly threw his legs over the
<br>
 side of the bed and had to jump down to the ground he was trying to walk forward towards the door when his over sized wet clothes fell around his knees tripping
<br>
 him he landed on his face in the soft carpet and shoke his head, in confusion 'whats goig on hear he thought as he herd the toilet flush. 
<br>

<br>
 Jay came back into the room still holding up his wet breifs and fumbled for the light switch, to the sink area he knew it was at about shoulder level just above the
<br>
 sink but it wasent there so he waved his hand up and down the wall and found it was way to high almost to the top of his head if not higher, and he switched it on,
<br>
 and looked in the mirror, what he saw stairing back at him shocked him and he let out a boyish sounding yelp, &quot;Oh god Im skinny as hell what the fucks going on
<br>
 here I look like a little kid!&quot; Jay said in a very high pitched voice. Mark strugled to his feet and looked over to the bathroom, the light was flooding into the room
<br>
 enough for Mark to realise he was in Jays room, but the little figure that was talking couldnt be his big buddy Jay, Mark steoed out of his wet clothes and went to
<br>
 where the boy was, and walked up behind him Mark was taller than this boy and could see his face in the mirror&quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS DID YOU DO
<br>
 THIS TO ME!&quot; Mark said looking at his hairless now skinny face with a rediculuse boys hair cut. Jay let his breifs hit the floor and ran from the bathroom with
<br>
 tears of confusion and fear starting to run down his sunken cheeks. Mark was still standing in front of the mirror and didnt want to beleive his eyes, there was a little
<br>
 skinny looking Mark stairing back at him all of the muscles he'd built over years of hard work and determination were now just skin and bones with dorky looking
<br>
 child like head on top of this wimpy body Marks arms were so thin that they looked frail and weak and this hair cut made him look like a 12 year old, and his once
<br>
 proud package was now as small as a 6 year olds with no hint of pubic hair at all &quot;AHAHAHHHHH NOOOO!!!!&quot;</p>
