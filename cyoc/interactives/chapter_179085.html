<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Marina gets good and settled, a loud boom is heard in the cafeteria, so of course she would go over there and check out what happened. At the center of the commotion is a rather plump reindeer  looking quite upset at another reindeer who is laying on the ground unconscious. There’s a lot of murmuring and chatting going around the circle formation. Marina picked up a few important bits from the crowd, something about “gossip,” “she smells,” “she’s perverted,” “don’t go near her,” before the circle broke apart and the crowds scattered as quick as it had formed. The plump reindeer fell to the ground with her “hands” in her face and began to sob. Seems like Marina seems to catch things at just the right time. She decides to be nice, maybe this reindeer could give her a hand.<br />
<br />
“Hey, are you ok?”<br />
<br />
“Leave me alone!” The reindeer said, obviously hurt from the events that just took place, “I don’t need anything else from anyone else, I just want to get out of here.”<br />
<br />
Aha! Marina just found her some way to get an extra pair of hands for her tasks. “I could help you get out of here, but you have to talk to me first.”<br />
<br />
She shrugged, “Yeah right. Like that’s gonna happen. Look Peppermint, I don’t know what kind of world you live in, but there’s no escape from here. You’re  more delusional than that acid trip named Orange.”<br />
<br />
Marina just let her be, but took notes on a few things she said, “Well, whatever then. I’m gonna finish some tasks and talk with my friend on the outside, have fun getting bullied for no reason.” She didn’t see it but she could tell she now had a curious pair of eyes watching her as she walked to the gigantic exit door. <br />
<br />
After getting a good look and feel for the door she walked back to her room and purposefully left it ajar. She began to write out the details of the door in the chat for Jack when she noticed a shadow and some breathing in her doorway. Marina expected this, so she walked as quietly over to the door as she could out of her intruder’s line of sight. After finding a good hiding spot and waiting patiently, she got what she wanted, the door opened for her stalker to come in to the room and wander around nervously looking for her. Marina pounced on her causing her to yelp, as she started to grind against her intruder’s leg with her wet pussy. The chubby reindeer went from nervous to horny in that moment as her nipples hardened with each stoke of her thigh. Marina kicked the door closed as she began to kiss her, teasing her nipples with her own. Before long, the machines once again caught on to the passion of these two as they were restrained on the wall and spread apart. After the machine collected their pussy juices, Marina saw another machine that looked like two funnels connected together head towards the other reindeer, as it stuck to her breasts a white fluid was shown coming out of the hose. The two were released from the restraints and back onto Marina’s comfy furniture and laid to rest. After the two recovered, Marina smelled something foul in the air, causing her to jolt awake and open the door to let that air out. Walking over to her new friend (who turned out to be the source of the stink), she tapped her to see if she would wake up, only for her response to be met with even more foul wind that erupted from the backside of the reindeer. She tried one more time to wake the unconscious reindeer only to quit after being met with enough gas to replace the oxygen in a small apartment. She walked over to Mocha’s room and knocked on her door, hoping for her to escape the smell for even a few minutes. Mocha opened the door, took one whiff, and shut the door on Marina, explaining through the door, “I don’t need my place smelling like that, I’m not too keen on butt stuff, maybe that one chick Coconut may be able to help you.” Well, thanks to Mocha, she was able to get her smelly guest’s name. After walking back into the room (despite the smell still being there) she walked over to take a good look at Coconut. Not only was she plump, she was a little shaggy, with extra long, unkempt hair, matted fur, extra fur under her arms and pussy (which had their own brand of musk to them) and even feathering like a horse. Despite her smell, she did actually look cute, and Marina figured she was just the help she was going to need for her escape. Before to long, Coconut started to come to, and immediately recoiled in disgust and shame when she smelled the room. Her persona completely changed as she began to speak, “Oh, oh, oh god, was that me!? Oh jeez! Oh no! I’m sorry! I’m just, I’m, ah jeez!” She was absolutely flustered and ashamed of herself, holding her ample ass in her hands trying to cover her asshole, fanning away the air that hung around her. Marina just watched this deer fumble all over herself, she couldn’t help but giggle. She put her hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eyes, “Calm down, relax. You’re freaking out a lot. Why don’t we start from the beginning, my name is Marina”<br />
<br />
“Hi, I’m Coconut, and I hate myself.” <br />
<br />
After a good 10 minutes of getting to know each other, Marina learned that Coconut was born as a reindeer with a heavy musk problem. Her fur would grow thick in the spots where the musk was the strongest, adding to that is the fact that her family is known for having gas problems for no reason, so they were labeled as outcasts in their own home. She was disowned and separated from her family before she came here, them seeing her as the worst of her breed, and hoping she doesn’t breed. She’s the only one that has let her into an actual room and even got her to cum without her masturbating. She almost admitting to liking Marina more than just friendship, but not that fast. At the end of the exchange, Coconut agreed to help Marina in exchange for taking her along when she escapes. After saying goodbye, Marina tried to get the smell of Coconut out of her room, just as she had finished, she got a blip from the chat from Jack. He’s finished analyzing the plans to find an exit route, but there’s just one more thing that he needs. He says that he needs a disturbance away from the route so that everyone will be focused on long enough for you to get out of sight along the exit route. You think about what to do next...</p>
