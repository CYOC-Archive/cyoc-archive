<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Continuity&#39;s gotten a bit muddy in this branch with all the awareness switcheroos. I&#39;ve rewritten the final paragraph of the previous chapter just to establish what Rick actually knows about the camera right now.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Eliza showered, Rick took the opportunity to examine the camera, trying to figure out if he&#39;d caused it any damage when he&#39;d dropped it just prior. That&#39;s when he noticed a couple of dials he could&#39;ve sworn weren&#39;t on it before. A Reality Alteration switch, a Subject Awareness dial?<br />
<br />
Rick had never heard of a camera with settings like these. Following a hunch, he opened the camera&#39;s digital menu, and hummed in interest when he found a whole bunch of additional options underneath the usual Exposure and Shutter Speed - stuff like Gender, Age, Species, Personality, and a bunch of other weird selections. <br />
<br />
It sounded like some sort of AR or automated filter functionality. It was definitely something unexpected to find in a camera that otherwise looked so old, but Rick supposed that its old owner might&#39;ve upgraded some of the internal tech and still kept the external look of the camera the same. That sounded like something a photography nut would do, if they were particularly attached to one of their devices.<br />
<br />
Rick left the Reality Alteration switch set to &quot;On&quot;, and spun the Subject Awareness dial from &quot;Off&quot; to the &quot;User Aware&quot; setting, before starting to scroll through some of the more bizarre options.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you wanna go to the movies or something-&quot; Eliza began.<br />
<br />
Rick startled from his preoccupation with the more exotic options at her voice, and the camera slipped from his still-sweaty grasp. <br />
<br />
It was a reflex to scrabble for purchase. Rick had already been worried he&#39;d damaged the camera earlier, and he felt the shutter button depress beneath his fingers in his haste. He just had enough time to note that he&#39;d managed to point the lens directly at Eliza before a blindingly bright light burst out of the camera&#39;s flash unit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or would you rather stay in?&quot; Alex finished, a mischievous smirk breaking across his scruffy jaw.<br />
<br />
Rick brushed his hand over his face as he ineffectually tried to blink the spots out of his vision. Two sets of memories warred at the forefront of his mind. The first were of Eliza, his sporty, tomboyish girlfriend, and they were rapidly being overtaken by the second - memories of Alex. Alex, who was still completely naked, wearing nothing but a towel. Alex, who was his hulking, jockish, domineering stud of a-<br />
<br />
&quot;Step- stepbrother?&quot; Rick yelped, stumbling back as his train of thought screeched to a halt. The dull thud of his back hitting the wardrobe barely registered as his brain experienced the closest thing it could to a blue screen. <br />
<br />
It was something straight out of a porn flick. Probably the worst porn flick to ever exist. What the fuck. What the fuck? Eliz- Alex was his-?<br />
<br />
Rick reflexively tried to jerk away as a huge mitt gripped his shoulder - and with a jolt of pure panic realized that he couldn&#39;t get away.<br />
<br />
Alex snorted as he kept Rick pinned to the wardrobe door, looking at Rick as though incredulous. &quot;Dude, you must&#39;ve really been horny if you watched that shit,&quot; Alex said. His smirk turned considering, and he waggled his eyebrows. &quot;Especially &#39;cause you can fuck your own sexy stepbrother whenever the hell you want.&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that, Alex dropped his towel, raised his other enormous arm into a picture-perfect flex, and gave Rick an exaggerated wink before licking the jaw-dropping peak of his biceps.<br />
<br />
Rick found himself swallowing instinctively as he stared at the brazen display. And then his eyes darted downards, past Alex&#39;s mountainous pecs and the rippling tank treads of his beefy musclegut, and he nearly swallowed his own tongue when he saw the huge, thick cock that hung halfway down his new stepbrother&#39;s beefy thigh... Soft. <br />
<br />
And then Rick processed what Alex had just said - specifically, the bit about fucking his own sexy stepbrother - and immediately redoubled his efforts to get away. It was clear some of the settings had changed when he dropped the camera; Rick had to fix things and change Alex back into, into... and with dawning horror, Rick realized that he&#39;d already forgotten the name of whoever Alex used to be just moments prior. <br />
<br />
But that didn&#39;t change anything. Rick still had to fix things - because sure, maybe he was bi, and sure, maybe he did spend a bit too long imagining what it might be like to climb Alex like a tree, and sure maybe he really did nearly fall to his knees and worship the massive schlong waggling between Alex&#39;s legs, but he couldn&#39;t be attracted to- okay, maybe he was attracted to- fuck, Rick had to admit that he was attracted to-<br />
<br />
That was when Alex took a step closer, lowering his flexed arm to bring the palm of it right against Rick&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
Rick instinctively froze. Cold terror washed down his spine like a waterfall of ice water, edged with a sharp, biting electricity that thrummed through his veins. His ears were buzzing as though he&#39;d made contact with a livewire, and he just barely registered himself going limp in Alex&#39;s grip over the sound of his own heartbeat pounding in his ears. Alex&#39;s fingers weren&#39;t tight enough to hurt - they were surprisingly gentle, actually - but Rick still felt himself bracing for something, turning towards Alex, lips opening as Alex drew closer and-<br />
<br />
Oh. Alex was kissing him. Someone was moaning, Rick registered distantly, but he was too preoccupied with the feeling of Alex&#39;s mouth on his to pay it much mind. <br />
<br />
It took his addled brain a couple of moments to piece everything together; the way he&#39;d felt alert, jittery, when Alex had flexed and dropped his towel; the way the fear of having Alex&#39;s hand around his throat had been tempered by the sharp, bright edge of his own arousal; the way he&#39;d already started to open his lips, unconsciously tilting his head towards Alex in blatant invitation...<br />
<br />
Someone was still moaning, soft and keening and desperate. It was only when Alex chuckled into his mouth that Rick realized that the someone was him.<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s body hadn&#39;t been standing idly by and waiting for Rick&#39;s brain to stop melting out of his ears - at some point in his mental reboot, he&#39;d started fruitlessly struggling against Alex&#39;s grip once again - except this time it wasn&#39;t to throw Alex off, but to pull him closer.<br />
<br />
That was when Alex bit down on Rick&#39;s lower lip, and Rick&#39;s brain decided that this was a great time to take another quick leave of absence from his body. He came back to the feeling of Alex patting his cheek gently - Rick couldn&#39;t remember when he&#39;d even let go of Rick&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love how desperate you get for me,&quot; Alex said. His smile turned sharp round the corners, and without any warning, the hand against Rick&#39;s face swung downwards. A loud grunt tore itself from Rick&#39;s throat when Alex roughly smacked it against his crotch.<br />
<br />
His dick was hard, Rick realized, as Alex manhandled him; his dick was achingly, desperately hard. And so was Alex: his stepbrother&#39;s huge erection was almost hypnotic at its full, massive length, dribbling a clear trail of precum. And yet for all that Alex was the one naked, it was Rick himself who was feeling stripped bare and desperately, achingly vulnerable.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s fingers loosened, then, and Rick nearly sobbed as his heart kicked into overdrive, the dizzy haze of his thoughts sharpened to almost crystalline clarity when Alex&#39;s grip stopped gently cutting off his circulation. And it was with that crystalline clarity he felt Alex shift, the hand that had been roughly kneading at Rick&#39;s achingly hard dick suddenly flipping up to push from under Rick&#39;s ass, heaving Rick onto a muscled cannonball of a shoulder before lazily spinning to face the bed.<br />
<br />
Rick knew it was coming. And he still lost every ounce of breath in his lungs when Alex toppled the both of them onto the mattress. Rick didn&#39;t struggle; he didn&#39;t want to. Getting more of Alex&#39;s skin on him was exactly what he wanted - and now, Alex&#39;s overwhelming bulk crushing him, that huge cock drooling precum all over Rick&#39;s belly, an uncontrollable heat welled up from deep inside his stomach and overflowed to fill the rest of him. <br />
<br />
It was overwhelming.  <br />
<br />
He&#39;d surrendered himself to that runaway heat, limbs going boneless, reduced to jelly, and yet, simultaneously, wound up so tightly that one misplaced move would undo him entirely.<br />
<br />
Rick barely registered the far-away rumble of Alex&#39;s voice until a broad palm smacked against his cheek with a decisive pat-pat. &quot;Huh?&quot; Rick said, blinking his eyes open. He peered blearily upwards until the vague silhouette above him resolved itself into something that looked a bit more like a face, with close-cropped blond hair and a chinstrap beard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still with me?&quot; Alex asked. <br />
<br />
Despite the out-of-body experience he was currently going through, Rick somehow managed to nod his head.<br />
<br />
Alex smirked. &quot;Attaboy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone started moaning again when Alex pulled Rick&#39;s head back by his hair and began mouthing up and down the too-sensitive lines of Rick&#39;s throat. It was Rick moaning, again; it had to be, because Alex was humming softly as he pressed gentle kisses into Rick&#39;s neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna let your big, strong, stepbro take care of you, Ricky?&quot; Alex rumbled. His fingers tightened in Rick&#39;s hair even further when Rick finally managed another jerky nod. &quot;Good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Time seemed to blur together and stick at the edges as Alex summarily undressed him. Rationally, Rick knew Alex must&#39;ve helped undo his belt or pulled his pants down, or even ripped his shirt away or over his head; but in the moment, it was as though Rick was fully clothed in one moment, and in the next he was gasping at the heat of Alex&#39;s sweaty skin against his own.<br />
<br />
Rick gasped in shock when something cold suddenly gripped around his dick. It startled him back into himself, and he managed to regain enough coherence to register that Alex had shifted position on top of him, bracketing Rick&#39;s body between his massive thighs, and the look of complete focus on Alex&#39;s handsome face as he reached a piledrive arm around to spread his muscled asscheeks was enough of an impetus for Rick to jerk his gaze downwards.<br />
<br />
He was just in time to see Alex&#39;s powerful, corded legs flex as the massive jock expertly maneuvered himself into the perfect position and sank down to take Rick&#39;s straining, rigid erection into his hole. <br />
<br />
This time, two voices groaned  together - but where Rick&#39;s was desperate and cracking, his asshole of a stepbrother just sounded satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Alex said, just barely out of breath, &quot;I missed that dick.&quot; And then he wiggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck-&quot; Rick exclaimed, and then jerked upwards with a barely bitten off, &quot;Holy FUCK-&quot; when Alex&#39;s hole flexed forcefully around his shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I wish I could&#39;ve taken you with me to college this year,&quot; Alex sighed, wistful, and those powerful legs gave another almighty flex when he sank down to take Rick&#39;s entire length up his ass, gently placing his hand on Rick&#39;s chest as though almost as an afterthought. <br />
<br />
That heavy palm was the only thing that kept Rick from jerking bodily off the mattress.<br />
<br />
&quot;But yeah, no way we could&#39;ve made that work,&quot; Alex said. He kept one hand on Rick&#39;s chest as he patted Rick&#39;s head with the other, delivering a sharp swat when Rick regained his bearings enough to try ineffectually to thrust upwards. &quot;Nuh uh. I&#39;ve been waiting since spring break to get you in me again, dude, you don&#39;t get to blow that easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did the calls not help?&quot; Rick found himself rasping, and all of a sudden he found himself remembering their near-nightly furtive video calls. And their pictures, and holy fuck, the videos - watching Alex helplessly moan Rick&#39;s name, vibrator buzzing in his ass, softball biceps flexing as his strapping stepbrother jerked his massive dick till it spat thick ropes of come onto his pecs. Unless maybe- &quot;Unless you didn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I love you so much,&quot; Alex said, interrupting him before Rick could even start on that line of thought properly, and he leaned down to capture Rick&#39;s mouth with a sudden, forceful kiss that made Rick&#39;s limbs turn to jelly just as the words finally registered and instantly sent his stomach into a happy flutter. &quot;I&#39;m just saying, it&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re only a year younger&#39;n me, &#39;cause I don&#39;t know how I would&#39;ve survived it if I had to wait any longer for you to finish school and come-&quot; as he punctuated the words with a forceful bounce that tore an insensate noise from Rick&#39;s throat, &quot;Live-&quot; bounce, &quot;With-&quot; bounce, &quot;Me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick whimpered.<br />
<br />
It made Alex laugh, of course. But then Alex started moving, and between the feeling of Alex&#39;s tight hole clenching around his dick, and Alex&#39;s calloused palm shifting upwards to once again press gently around his throat, Rick quickly became too overwhelmed to answer as his thoughts rapidly slowed down to that hazy state of contentment he&#39;d already become addicted to.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s face was flushed pink as he rode Rick with a furious precision, barrel chest flexing with every desperate movement of his mountainous arm as he desperately jerked his enormous cock, those sharp blue eyes trained on Rick with an almost terrifying intensity. Rick had no idea how Alex managed it - it took all of Rick&#39;s strength to lie in the mattress and just barely hold himself back from shattering into tiny pieces. <br />
<br />
And then Alex&#39;s movements hitched once, and again, and then he was desperately clutching Rick to his flushed, heaving pecs, rivulets of sweat pouring down Rick&#39;s cheek as Alex&#39;s hole spasmed around his dick again and again, rope after rope after rope of come exploding from the head of Alex&#39;s magnificent prick as he muffled his broken wails into Rick&#39;s messy, sweat-soaked hair. <br />
<br />
An unbearable heat pulled tight between Rick&#39;s legs, and he thrust upwards once, twice, and before it finally let loose and Rick&#39;s orgasm crashed over him and took him apart in its wake. As though from a great distance, Rick heard his own voice, rough and ragged between his clenched teeth, as he thrusted, and thrusted, and thrusted, filling Alex with the load that had been brewing in his balls for so long. <br />
<br />
Rick, detachedly, realized that he&#39;d been clutching at Alex so tightly that his knuckles had gone white. He faintly registered Alex gently lowering both of them back onto the mattress while he tried to remember enough about how his fingers worked so he could finally let go, and he only realized that he&#39;d been quietly sobbing from the force of his release when Alex knocked their foreheads together and reached his calloused thumbs up to wipe at Rick&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worth the wait?&quot; Rick finally managed. Fuck, but his voice was ruined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; Alex said, sounding as ruined as Rick felt.<br />
<br />
What did it say about him, Rick found himself wondering idly, that he&#39;d so readily accepted a reality where he was in an almost-incestuous relationship with his stepbrother?<br />
<br />
The realization entirely unmoored him.<br />
<br />
And then Alex took in a deep breath, before loosing it in a low, contented hum. &quot;Love you, Ricky,&quot; he murmured. <br />
<br />
And suddenly Rick was grounded again. &quot;I love you too, Lex,&quot; he said, and let himself fall asleep in his stepbrother&#39;s solid arms.</p>
