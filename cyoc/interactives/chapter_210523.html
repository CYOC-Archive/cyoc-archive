<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gem burst into five separate pieces, each one spreading to each of the five areas of the circle. Only Peter seemed to notice, everyone was more preoccupied with Stacy’s outburst than the unlikely splitting of the gem. But he noticed it, and he also noticed as they each began to glow…<br />
<br />
“Uhm… Blake?” Peter said, stepping back from the circle,<br />
“What’s up babe?” She asked, looking at what he was looking at, “that’s weird,” she said, tilting her head to one side, intrigued. She nudged Nancy, who was more preoccupied with making sure Stacy didn’t punch her mother. She’d been through this scenario more than once. She looked at Blake, then to the circle,<br />
“Oh my god…” she said, stepping back, but not before telling the remaining mother and daughter of the issue, “Mrs. Rickswell, Stacy…”<br />
“WHAT!?” Stacy screamed, looking down at where Nancy was pointing. Suddenly her eyes went wide, “i-it…”<br />
“Young lady!” Jane yelled back, “you better pay attention to me when I’m speaking to!”<br />
A devilish look entered Stacy’s eyes, “NO!” She cried, “and maybe you’ll respect me after I do THIS!”<br />
<br />
She grabbed her mothers arm and swung her into the centre of the circle, exiting it herself. Jane stood disoriented in the middle. She looked back at her daughter and yelled,<br />
“THAT’S IT! THAT WAS THE FINAL STRAW!” She looked as if she was going to explode with anger, “I CANNOT STAND THIS BEHAVIOUR ANY LONGER. By next week, I expect you to be a COMPLETELY changed person. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME!?” She finished. She was panting, out of breath as it ended.<br />
Stacy looked upon her with a twinkle in her eyes. But not one of sorrow nor understanding. One of anger. One of revenge. One of hatred and darkness and all that which made her mother dead to her,<br />
“Aperi rosae portas, mundum intra, et reginam pete thronum tuum,” she spoke in a tongue that did not belong to her.<br />
“What?” Everyone said harmoniously in their choir of confusion.<br />
<br />
Jane suddenly fell to the ground, hitting her head hard against the solid wooden floorboards, almost smudging the chalk of the circle Stacy had drawn.<br />
“OH MY GOD YOU KILLED HER!!?” Blake cried, horrified at the sight she was looking at,<br />
“D-did you actually just kill her…” Peter said, equally scared,<br />
“Stacy…” Nancy said, being the only voice she was willing to listen to, “w-what have you done?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly the right thing!” Jane said with a joyous tone in her voice. Everyone, including Stacy, looked on in shock and horror, confused beyond anything they had ever misunderstood in their lives,<br />
“W-what the hell is going on…” Blake said, a look of horror on her face as Jane pushed herself up from the ground. Each bone cracking as she pressed them into the hard wooden floor.<br />
“Not quite,” Jane said, biting her lips and she stood back up straight. She looked at her hands as if they were brand new to her, “incredible, look at these nails!” She announced with pride. She looked at everyone as they stared at her with not only horror, but disgust. She placed her hand on her jaw, realising it was completely dislocated, “oops,” she said, giggling. She placed her other hand on her jaw and snapped it, fixing it into place.<br />
Most people were disgusted, cringing at what they had just seen. Jane couldn’t help but laugh. She locked eyes with her daughter,<br />
“I feel as though you are responsible for this? Am I correct?” She asked,<br />
“M-mom?” Stacy asked, looking in disbelief,<br />
“Oh come on!” Jane shouted, staring deep into Stacy’s soul, “you’re meant to be the smart one here. Do I really sound like your ‘Mom’?” She asked. She cleared her throat, “ahem… allow me to explain. Your mother is gone,”<br />
“L-like dead?” Blake asked,<br />
“NO!” Jane, or the imposter behind her eyes, screamed at her suddenly, “what’s your obsession with death? Anyway, no, your mother is not ‘dead’ like your friend may believe. She is no longer the inhabitant of this body of hers. And may I say, what a marvellous body this is!” She said, gawking at the body she was in.<br />
She immediately placed her hands on the body’s breasts, squeezing them firmly, “shame they aren’t on display,” she said. She took the top of the blouse and violently tore it open, revealing the cleavage of her relatively large breasts to be put on display for everyone to see. She bent over, showing of her knockers to the whole audience, jiggling them with a smile on her face. She bit her lip once again, “I always enjoy human breasts. Something about them, they’re just so much fun!” She said, smiling once again, looking everyone in the eyes as if she were a performer to a crowd, “but I must say, they’re much more fun when they’re being used to their purpose, don’t you agree?” She locked eyes with Peter, grinning seductively. He looked very uncomfortable.<br />
She moved her fingers to where her nipples were, and suddenly they grew large, indenting the fabric of her blouse a little more. She squeezed them, causing her breasts to suddenly start engorging with what could only be assumed as milk,<br />
“Don’t pretend you don’t love them, sweetheart,” she said, still locking her eyes with Peter, squeezing her breasts more and more as they slowly grew larger, two stains appearing on the front of her blouse. She continued making eye contact until her eyes began to glow a deep, deep red, “now these breasts are irresistible to men, so much so that one would be unable to hold back from tearing open this blouse and sucking on these long, hard nipples,” she finished. Staring at Peter, waiting for whatever masculine urges would suddenly overcome him.<br />
<br />
Jane’s body looked awkward, still rubbing her breasts for an uncomfortable Peter to watch. But he didn’t want to watch, he just wanted to get the hell out of there!<br />
“Usually a little quicker than this…” she said, smiling awkwardly,<br />
“W-what’s going on…” Peter asked, “i-is this some kind of joke?” he cried, beginning to cry, “I just wanna go home! I don’t care if this is just another one of Stacy’s weird tricks she alway pulls I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE!!”<br />
“No no no no NO!” She shouted, looking down at her breasts, “did I do something wrong?” She asked herself, “unless…” she stopped, a smile once again appearing on her face. She bit her lip again,<br />
“You wouldn’t happen to have a… more refined taste, would you?”<br />
“E-excuse me?” He said, jumping to offensive.<br />
“Oh my god…” Nancy said, covering her mouth as her eyes went wide with shock,<br />
“Looks like someone else worked it out, too,” Jane’s body said, “you, my dear friend, are a homosexual!”</p>
