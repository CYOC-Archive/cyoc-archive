<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ready to chomp down and trim off both cock and balls from this scared Pledge Master, he stands captured by a huge donkey mouth. As with eyes wide the young man looks down and into the dark eyes of what is then a donkey stud, but was a friendly and impressionistic pledge.<br />
<br />
Whining, the Pledge Master says, &quot;Please, oh please, I only meant to let you have some horny fun, but it went too far, you accepted too much, and now...now you are as a donkey; I am sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Twixt in his mind as wanting to do bodily harm to the person who helped make a foolhardy try to feel accepted among the brotherhood, and did something wholly unholy worse. Undecided then to do harm, a donkified human moves back, letting the tented trousers and the cock and balls in them slip from the toothy grasp.<br />
<br />
The desire to make the wish known of preferring then to run free, to become as it is to be like a donkey, this want comes out a changed throat as braying screams.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite, calm down, if someone is downstairs and hears you, your sorry ass self will be humiliated beyond all your endurance. Come, I decided to help you run free,&quot; said the Pledge Master, he reached his fingers to take a grip about one of the silver strands of the life changing halter.<br />
<br />
The tug of the halter sends through a partially still human brain the suggestion of moving along and doing it urgently.<br />
<br />
Tugged from the room and into the hallway, a hand firmly gripped to the silver stranded halter move the new donkey to the rear stairs and down them to the main floor. They move together, both out the rear door and across the sandy parking lot. <br />
<br />
Once past the parking area, the brush and bushes offer an excellent hiding place for a donkey until the sun set and with darkness, offers an easy escape to beastly freedom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here now, you stay here until dark, then you are on your own!&quot; The still scared Pledge Master says, he still cannot fully believe this donkey was a human some few hours previous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee...haw,&quot; is the response, a sort of communication but one only the donkified student understands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, but I hope you have some fun, being a donkey, and with such a tool, even I wish I had mine looking like yours!&quot; The Pledge Master states, his words and thoughts as much like a wish as a wish could be and to a spellbound, cursed, donkey.<br />
<br />
He then leaving the donkey alone, it stuck that furry head out of the bushes; as if he wanted in the worst way to speak another thought of thanks to the new found friend.  <br />
<br />
In a hurry to enter the frat house and return to the bedroom where all this magical stupidity began, he had the thought to remove the incriminating evidence.<br />
<br />
Hurriedly he grabbed at one item and then another, boxing the leftover items together and with plans to take them down and put the box into the Herbycurby.<br />
<br />
Plans do not always work out as well as the planner might wish. As from the urgency of his plan, adrenalin pumped into his blood making him septic to the changing infectious items there remaining as the unused parts of the donkey suit. <br />
<br />
The sound of voices and footsteps coming upstairs only made the fear of capture grow stronger. Fearful for those coming to find out the donkey suit arrived and of its use, he hid then in a closet.<br />
<br />
Scared and standing in the darkness, his mind drifted to vivid memories of a pledge as a donkey and sporting one hell of a massive cock.<br />
<br />
As much he felt scared, this young man wished he were as much a donkey and for the freedom found by one fellow, all if he had the choice then and the chance, he would take it!<br />
<br />
There in the darkness of that closet as he stood there scared, there began coming out the corner of that packing box a whisper white and glowing smoke.<br />
<br />
The glowing smoke spiraled up into a slinky column, it taking a form of one slender womanly form. The glowing form continued to solidify, becoming all too real of a long eared, slightly donkified female creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did well, and your help in releasing your donkey friend requires a reward!&quot; So said this wildly sexy, sleek and slender, furry as much naked female donkey-woman.<br />
<br />
Even before any words of thanks or wish were spoken, the womanly form returned to smoke and curled around, moving down but filtering in through the fabric of some tented trouser zipper undies. <br />
<br />
Sudden searing hot pain burned all around the maleness of this Pledge Master with integrity.<br />
<br />
He fell to his knees, the sensation as if a fire were searing his maleness made him grab at it and hold it tightly.<br />
<br />
Moaning of this type coming from a closet causes those there to come out of their rooms and listen.<br />
<br />
The bursting in of bright light made the Pledge Master fellow turn red from his feeling wholly embarrassed. Amid heckled words and those there making sport of this anguished fellow brother, he jumped to his feet and did run down the rear stairs and outside the frat house.<br />
<br />
Outside and to the bushes, but his donkified fellow friend had fled, he seeking green pastures and the hope of finding some willing females to breed and breed often!<br />
<br />
Embarrassment kept this young man hiding until later in that afternoon when some of the wilder young women from a fraternity house down the same street came there to party and have their usual Saturday night orgy.<br />
<br />
Peering out from where he hid, this brother stood seemingly able then to sniff the scent of women feeling passion and wanting their bodies ravaged. This sent him into an aching fit, he unzipped his pants and to his delight and dismay he saw his maleness. A arcing male equine like organ stuck out of his opened zipper.<br />
<br />
All a deep purplish and black, it reminded him of his donkified brother and fellow frat pledge. The thing stood up and out huge and very long, almost as long as was his forearm. He whimpered at seeing the thing, maybe worst of it was that the circumcision he had at birth was then like to that uncut donkey cock he saw, held, and so much wished he too had one like it.<br />
<br />
Panic and some heavy breathing bade more of his wish to come into reality. His maleness was fully formed into that of a stud male donkey. He felt the tender folds of a donkey sheath, and of testicles the size of Kiwi fruit.<br />
<br />
As he stood there elated of his new sensations, the spreading sprouting growth of a thick donkey skin and coarse pelt of fur raced to cover him from head to stiffening toes.</p>
