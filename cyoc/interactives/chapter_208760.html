<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they were going towards their crummy house, the two burglars were feeling elated. They had robbed things and could sell these! That woman was such an idiot! They guffawed and walked merrily. But as they were laughing, thinking of all the beer and wine they&#39;d soon buy at the tavern, they were both feeling discomforts coming on, although they stayed quiet. John was feeling muscle cramps, as if his body was pressing upon itself. As for Chris, his groin felt dull and his testicles pressed. Yet they moved on, glad to eventually reach their derelict house.<br />
<br />
Once there, they put the stolen goods on the ground haphazardly but didn&#39;t even have time to cut through a dried sausage for their dinner before they felt things were going really so strangely that it was impossible not to notice. Chris stared at John intently.<br />
&quot;Hey, dude... You... Your stubble is gone. And... You look younger. Shorter...&quot;<br />
&quot;What?...&quot;<br />
John touched his face, bewildered and rushed to stare at his reflection in a small broken mirror on a rickety table. Chris wasn&#39;t joking. He did look several years younger, before his facial hair finally decided to grow out. As for Chris, he was intrigued but quickly became preoccupied by other matters. His chest hurt and his genitals felt really painful. He looked into his pants and started screaming. His penis and testicles were vanishing! Or more precisely, they were retreating into a hole numbly carved into his flesh as if his privates were becoming a mirror image of themselves, inside the folds of his body and as an empty space, as far as he could tell.Soon he had to admit the truth: he had no more manhood! Instead he had a vagina! A cunt! A real one! He was right afterwards snapped out of his horrible fascination as he saw two globes of flesh on his chest expand like balloons. He screamed and jumped around. His two humongous boobs followed suit, jiggling and bouncing, as it they had a mind of their own. As he stared at this new unfolding of his anatomy, he witnessed his hips widening and becoming child-bearing indeed. More fat appeared upon his frame and he soon finished his transformation as a chubby, buxom yet beautiful  young woman, indeed the sort that easily radiates a glow of motherhood. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m a chick! A chick!&quot; Chris yelped, feeling a lack of movement down his pants and too much bouncy movements higher up. <br />
He turned around as he heard a small frightened stammer on the other side of the single room of the house. John was gone. Instead was a toddler who was already experimenting difficulties with standing up.<br />
&quot;John?...&quot; he said hesitatingly.<br />
The toddler just attempted incomprehensible gurgle and fell on its behind as he regressed further. Soon, he was lying flat on his back, crying and flailing his arms miserably. But soon even uncoordinated movements were too mature for him and he just cried like any newborn infant could. Chris was mesmerized by John&#39;s transformation, so much that he failed to notice a long bloody protrusion emerging from his new womb. Like a proboscis, as it reached the ground, it felt around, shyly at first but then with more assurance, having zeroed in on what it was looking for. When he finally noticed the fleshy and bloody tentacle going about in front of him like a horrid giant worm, he yelled at the top of his lungs. He noticed his voice much much higher-pitched than before but out of pure panic, he grabbed the disgusting worm and out of sheer desperation tugged at it, willing it to tear away from his body. It did not work and on the contrary, it hurt like hell. The feeling of this parasitic cord was also absolutely vile, squishy, gory and with a vein in it. <br />
Meanwhile, the worm-like tentacle had at last reached what it was looking for. The infant John. Finally it could perform its function. Groping on the floor was over. It attached itself to John&#39;s bellybutton, creating a sharp but brief pinch, eliciting another wail from the infant, now almost blind and deaf. John felt cold and wished above all to be in a tight warm space. His wish was soon granted and the tentacle shortened, retracting into its place of origin and dragging the little baby with him. Chris could only shriek in pure terror and hopelessly cry for help. He then thought of the old lady they had robbed from and understood why this curse was suddenly befalling them. He shouted for the witch to stop, to help him and let out a string of apologies but nothing stopped. The infant John was being dragged ever more towards him and he also came to the full terrifying realization of what was to occur. He was going to get pregnant with his pal! Pregnant! Determined to escape such a gruesome fate, he seized a knife planted on a derelict table and gripped both it and his nerves. He was going to cut this worm-like, bloody umbilical cord and be done with it. Too bad for John, but it couldn&#39;t be helped. Each one for himself and all of that. Yet it was frightening and as Chris required time to steel himself and do the deed, his clumsy attempt at sectioning the cord was interrupted by a wave of pain in his pelvis and groin, worse than he had ever experienced. Howling in agony, he collapsed to the ground on his back and spread and shook his legs, his movements tearing his pants off. For the proboscis, things could not have gone better! Now no need to retreat upwards with its precious cargo up its owner in a vertical position. It could enter much more easily in an horizontal fashion. It would make the process much, much easier. It retracted itself faster. No time to waste! If the baby needed to be safe in the womb, the sooner and faster the better. Already Chris&#39;d new vaginal opening was spread wide open and stretching wider. Perfect! Those hips and large birthing canal were the best its basic function and survival instinct and purposes could have hoped! Beyond hope, really! As it slid up for good back into the vagina, John instinctively curled upon himself. He didn&#39;t like it here. Too much noise and movements and cold and sounds and hard materials! Both he and the proboscis felt relived as John&#39;s feet touched the skin of Chris and his body proceeded to rise up, slowly but steadily, the short distance to the entrance of Chris&#39;s vulva.   <br />
<br />
It had been hard work, getting John fully inside Chris&#39; womb. At least once settled the infant had immediately regressed further into a foetus and had posed no issues whatsoever, slipping into a deep slumber as soon as he was fully in the womb. Things had not been as peaceful and patient for Chris, of course. Like any normal woman giving birth, he had shouted in agony and terror. Moreover, as the process was an unbirthing the sensations had been quite hard to deal with. The travel from exterior to the womb had been slow yet steady, the muscles of Chris&#39; canal and womb doing a stellar job and the spasms of reverse contraction, though unpleasant and racking Chris with pain meaning that barely three hours after starting, John had finally been set in a womb where he had regressed further to a four-month-old foetus. Vaguely aware of what was happening to him, Chris was simultaneously happy, scared and disgusted. Disgusted by the fact that he was going into a guy&#39;s very body now turned female, no less. Scared because he was going to became a foetus, not knowing what would precisely occur to him. Happy because he was going in a place which his new feelings saw as a lot more comfortable and safe. Moreover, as the last remnants of his adult mind lingered, he was watching an immense privacy coming towards him! As a young male obsessed with sex, this was quite a view to enjoy! Never mind it was John’s ! He could feel the soft lips encasing him as he entered the womb for good and he had a prime view of the female genitalia!This fascination rendered him even less capable of fighting back, not that it would have stopped the process.<br />
As John settled into his new home, Chris was a crying, sweating and exhausted mess. The pain finally receded and he could do nothing more than close his eyes and fall asleep. He&#39;d go back to the witch when he woke up. He was in no way about to do anything now. He&#39;d ask her to remove such a horrible her, begging her if he had to. And if that did not work, he&#39;d have no regret threatening her.</p>
