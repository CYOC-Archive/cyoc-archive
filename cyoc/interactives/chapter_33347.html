<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While both girls/women were thinking the situation over, Katie noticed something strange. &quot;Hey Tiff, were those clothes always there?&quot; Tiff looked over where she and Katie had put their clothing, only to see that it had been replaced by other clothing. &quot;Well that's strange&quot; Tiff said walking over to were the new clothes were. &quot;I thought this is were we put our stuff? I wonder how this got here and were our stuff has gone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiff and Katie picked up the new items and looked them over. After some time, Katie came up with a suggestion. &quot;Hey Tiff, this stuff looks like it might fit us. You wanna try it on?&quot; &quot;Yeah sure, why not. After all, I am starting to get a little cold being naked this long.&quot; And with that, both women dressed themselves in the clothes that they found.<br />
<br />
It seemed that Katie's set had been made for a banker or office worker. She had a white blouse, a gray knee length skirt, a gray top, a matching set of white panties and bra, pantyhose, and some gray heels with a two inch lift. Tiff, on the other hand, seemed to have gotten a VP's power suit. She had a white blouse, black dress slacks, a black top, a matching set of black bra and thong, and a pair of leather flat dress shoes. When the two women were dressed, they looked at each other and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Katie, dressed like that, you look like those hot secretaries you see on TV.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah Tiff? Well you look like one of those power hungry corporate types on those soap operas.&quot; When both women were done laughing, they noticed purses on the counter of the kitchen. They each walked over to the one that best fit their new outfits and opened them up. Inside was all sorts of make-up, accessories, a cell phone, a change purse, and a pocket book with ID's. Katie and Tiff picked up the ID's and looked at them. The photo's were of them as they were now, and their ages read 36.<br />
<br />
It was at this point the two women looked at each other. They were both getting a little freaked out now, and it was Katie to first talk. &quot;Okay Tiff, either somebody is messing with us really good right now, or something is very wrong.&quot; &quot;Y-yeah. How did they already get pictures of us like this? And the address on this ID isn't my home either.&quot; Katie hadn't checked her address yet, but now she noticed Tiff was right, her address was different. In fact, when both women compared, they now had the same address.<br />
<br />
Tiff then seemed to remember something. &quot;Hey Katie. I think I actually know where this address is. It's over in the rich neighborhood on the north side of town. You know, past the mall.&quot; Katie thought for a second and then knew what Tiff was talking about. &quot;Yeah, I know where your talking about. Do you wanna try going there?&quot; Tiff gave a worried look before responding. &quot;Well, as much as I want to find out what is going on, do you think it is wise?&quot; Katie gave her friend a slight glare and Tiff shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Ok Katie, well go.&quot; Both women packed up their purses and headed outside. <br />
<br />
Once outside, Tiff and Katie saw a sports car in the driveway. &quot;Huh, I wonder who that belongs too?&quot; Katie questioned. &quot;I think I do&quot; Tiff said, reaching into her purse. After a few seconds, Tiff produced a key and pushed a button. Sure enough, the car unlocked itself. &quot;No way!&quot; Katie exclaimed. &quot;This is awesome and weird all at the same time.&quot; &quot;Well, let's get in.&quot; Tiff said opening the door for Katie. Once in the car, Tiff started it up with no problems and started off for the mysterious address on their ID's.<br />
<br />
When they got in the neighborhood, Katie suggested that they stop for directions, but Tiff just kept driving. After a time, Tiff pulled up to a very nice one story house. &quot;Tiff&quot; Katie started to ask, &quot;how did you know where this place was?&quot; Tiff just smiled and said, &quot;Well, I just kinda knew. You know, like going home. You just kinda know.&quot; Both of the women got out of the car and approached the door. Katie then produced a key from her purse and tried it on the door. It opened.<br />
<br />
Katie and Tiff walked into the house and turned on the lights. The house was very nice and stylish. They both split up and started walking around. Katie went into the living room, were she found a very nice entertainment set with all leather couches. As she continued to look around, she came across pictures. The pictures were of her and Tiff at the ages of 20 and up. They were doing many things in the photo's that she now remembered doing. There were pictures of parties, vacations, family, graduations, and many with her and Tiff holding hands or kissing. It was strange to not only see, but remember this life she had never lived.<br />
<br />
Tiff on the other hand had gone to the bedroom. There she looked around and saw a king sized bed with all silk sheets and pillow covers. There were two night stands, and she walked over to the one she liked best. On it where many things she had on her night stand at home, except for a picture. The picture was of her and Katie on a beach, kissing as the sun set in the background. She looked at this picture for a while, as she could not only remember the kiss, but the vacation they were on as well. When she was done, she got up and opened the closet closest to her and saw it filled with clothing that all seemed to fit her.<br />
<br />
When both women were done exploring, they met up in the kitchen. &quot;So Tiff, does this feel like home?&quot; Tiff looked at Katie, as Katie just stared at the ground. &quot;Yeah, it does. And not only that, this feels like my...like our life together. I am remembering so many things we have done together that I know we haven't done. It's like reality has rewritten itself to match these bodies we got.&quot; &quot;I know, but do you think any of this is wrong. I mean, all of this is really nice and all, but aren't we still 16 year old girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point Tiff walked over to Katie and lifted her head. &quot;I don't know, so let me ask you a question. When I kiss you, does it feel like your a 16 year old girl kissing her best friend, or a 36 year old woman kissing her life partner, her lover?&quot; With that, Tiff embraced Katie, letting her body do what she felt it had done for years. Katie completely returned the kiss, just like she felt she had done so many times in the past. When the moment was over, and the two women separated, Tiff looked at Katie questionly. &quot;I guess Tiff, if I were to pick anything, I'd say a 36 year old woman who wants nothing more than to lay down with her lover after a long day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiff smiled, and hugged Katie tightly. She knew that they might be able to go back to the mansion and try more fruit to get their old lives back, but why not try this life out first. Everything she could remember about this existence was so nice anyways. She had a nice home, a great job, a cool car, and her best friend as her beautiful lover. And deciding that she was content for now, her and Katie proceed to the bedroom to fully try out this new life to the fullest.</p>
