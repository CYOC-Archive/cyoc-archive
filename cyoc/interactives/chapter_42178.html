<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marry hated attending church now. Before she had found it a bit on the boring side. Over the last month though she had come to hate it. It wasn't surprising really with everyone holding her up as an example. Her parents made her come though and here she was listening to the gospel choir. She noticed Harriette was here and she seemed a little down. She wondered what had happened.<br />
<br />
The choir finished and Father Winston walked up to the podium. He was holding something in his hand but Marry couldn't make out what it was. He looked out at the congregation and said &quot;My friends! I come before you today a humble man! I have made some mistakes but God in his infinite wisdom has forgiven me! What mistakes have I made you may ask! I have strayed from what is right and true! God knows the mistakes I made and He forgave me when I asked for forgiveness! Now I ask for forgiveness from all of you! I ask for forgiveness from Marry and Harriette! Marry is not possessed by demons! Not all mysticals are evil! I realized this last night my friends!&quot; He held up the necklace he had in his hands and Marry recognized it as Harriette's. &quot;I took this necklace from Harriette last night!&quot; he continued. &quot;I put it in a jar of Holy Water and there was no reaction! No reaction my friends! This means that this necklace does not have an evil taint! Harriette is not tainted by evil! Many of you will not know who Harriette is! She's one of those individuals who have been transformed! Her name before was Harry and she was a boy! I'm sure you all remember Harry! Many of you knew him as your daughter's friend! The only friends that Harry had were girls! I can not say if Harry was destined to become a girl but he is one now! Come up here Harriette so I may give your necklace back to you and I pray that you do good with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harriette stood up and walked up to the podium. She wasn't the only one that had gotten up though. Alex stood up and rushed to the podium saying &quot;Father Winston! You're being affected by that necklace! I beg you to not hand it back to the demon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not giving this necklace to a demon!&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;The reaction of evil coming in contact with Holy Water is unmistakable!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex stopped short and before he could do anything else Father Winston took out a small bottle of Holy Water and splashed him with it. The reaction was immediate. Where the Holy Water had hit him became red and bubbly. Smoke was rising from his skin and he let out an un-holy shriek.<br />
<br />
The congregation was stunned by this and they watched as Alex's body transformed. Hair grew all over his body and his fingernails became claws. He tore off his clothes as his body contorted.<br />
<br />
Marry saw all this and knew that she had to do something before someone got hurt. She stood up and said &quot;Shaela!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaela appeared in the aisle with Mary's necklace in her mouth. She tossed it toward Marry and said &quot;Catch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marry did manage to catch her necklace. Once she had it she said &quot;Mystic Girl Power!&quot; Her necklace glowed green and spread over her body. Her ears crawled up the side of her head and became fox ears. Her white dress turned green and the hem shortened into a skirt. Her Mary Janes and tights fused together and became her green boots. Her green gloves appeared on her arms as two fox tails grew from her back. The glow faded and her necklace disappeared.<br />
<br />
Alex had finished transforming into his demonic wolf form but his skin was still smoking. Marry quickly said &quot;Tangled Root!&quot; pointing at Alex. Roots sprang up from the floor and wrapped themselves around his legs. Alex didn't like this and he tried to get away. He growled and snarled at Father Winston as he began the Rite of Exorcism.<br />
<br />
Marry didn't know if Father Winston could exorcise the demon or not but she figured that he could use some help. &quot;Shaela, go get Jen and Allison please&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Shaela said and vanished.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Charlene and Andrew didn't go to church. They knew that God existed and that was enough for them. So it was that they were shopping with Jen and Allison when Shaela appeared. &quot;There you are&quot; she said. People in the mall stopped and looked at the talking cat. &quot;You're needed at church.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the demonic wolves is there&quot; Shaela said. &quot;Marry has it trapped for now but no one has moved from the pews. You would think that a demon in church would frighten them and make them run for the exits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take us there&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Charlene said but they had already disappeared. &quot;Oh I hope they'll be ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure they will be&quot; Andrew said. &quot;There's only one of them and it's in a church. How bad can it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A demon in a church is bad&quot; Charlene said with a worried look on her face.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
When Jen and Allison appeared in church they saw a surreal scene. The congregation was sitting in the pews while the priest was performing the exorcism. The demon's body was smoking and it was snarling and howling. Harriette was by the podium and just standing there. Marry was in her magical girl form and they could see her straining to keep her hold on the demon.<br />
<br />
As one Jen and Allison transformed and that got the attention and Allison used this to asked &quot;Why are you still here?! That's a demon up there! There's a demon in a church!&quot; That seemed to penetrate and most of them ran for the exit. They didn't make it though as there were two more demonic wolves at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Jen took one look and said &quot;We're in trouble.&quot;</p>
