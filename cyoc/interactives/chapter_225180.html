<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bus finally arrived to pick Damon up for his first day of prekindergarten.  It opened its doors and a woman stepped out of the bus and asked, &quot;Are you Damon?&quot;  &quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m headed to prekindergarten today!  &quot;Wonderful!  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have lots of fun there, today.  I&#39;m the bus helper, let me show you where to sit&quot;, said the woman with a smile.  Damon smiled back and was escorted onto the bus. He was led to a set towards the front of the bus where all of the other prekindergartners sat.  He sat down next to a boy playing with a toy dinosaur.  The little boy looked up at Damon and asked him, &quot;What&#39;s your name?  &quot;Damon.&quot;, replied Damon, &quot;What&#39;s your&#39;s?&quot;  &quot;My name is Ryan!&quot; replied the little boy with a smile.  Alarm bells should have gone off in the minds of the bus driver and the bus helper, but they didn&#39;t.  They didn&#39;t question why a 30 year old man got on the bus.  Nor, did they question why a four year old was waiting for the bus without a parent considering that was school policy.  Damon and Ryan continued to make small talk as the bus meandered its way through town.  As other boys and girls got on the bus, Damon and Ryan talked about dinosaurs, trains, and cars as they started to develop a friendship.  As the bus pulled up the the school, Damon saw the school and developed a fun, happy, giggly feeling inside his head.  When the bubbly feelings inside his head finished, he became super excited about his brand new class.  It was going to be the bestest day ever!  He instinctively knew that he was going to get to play with the other boys and girls and was really excited.  The helper made sure that everyone got off the bus and that the prekindergartners stayed together as two teachers approached them.  The teachers then called out names and divided the prekindergartners into two classes.  Damon thought it super cool that his new best friend Ryan was in the same class as him.  The teacher then lined the students up by asking each child to hang on to a ring that was attached to a long rope called a crocodile and led them into the building and down a corridor that separated the special needs room, the prekindergarten rooms, and the kindergarten rooms from the rest of the school.  The kids entered the the room and remained in line holding the crocodile so he wouldn&#39;t escape. the teacher then showed the kids their cubby where they could hang their coats and put their book bags.  Starting at the front of the crocodile, she showed each student their individual cubby and helped them put their things away.  She had to assume some of the kids hadn&#39;t learned how to spell their names yet.  Each child, starting with the first, let go of their ring when asked and let the teacher show them where their individual cubby was and help them put their things away.  When it was Damon&#39;s turn, the teacher asked him where his cubby was, but he couldn&#39;t find it because he didn&#39;t know how to spell his name.  Little did he know that this was the very first test he took at this school.  The teacher was trying to find out if Damon could spell his name and which letters he could recognize if he knew any.  In the teacher&#39;s mind, the fact that she noticed his disposable training pants under his shorts, his lack of a school backpack, and his lack of name recognition when it was written on a paper really concerned her.  Perhaps he was in the wrong class!  She pointed out his cubby and asked him what color was above his cubby and on either side of his cubby.  Damon had answered blue for his cubby and the colors beside his were pink and yellow.  The teacher was relieved.  Most students call pink &quot;red&quot;, but she knew that Damon was still very behind.  She had then told him to sit on a green circle on the carpet, but instead, Damon sat next to Ryan on a purple circle.  The teacher left Damon to his own devices preferring to get through all of the students left in the crocodile.  She made a mental note that either Damon didn&#39;t know the color purple or he intentionally didn&#39;t follow directions.  She was going to find out which it was and focus on it.  She already knew that she&#39;d have to ask Damon to go to the bathroom every two hours.  Once she finished emptying the crocodile, she picked up the poor lonely &quot;creature&quot; and returned him to where he lived.  She then went to the head of the class and started the morning exercise routine.  she would get them to sing while they exercised and it would be a good time for each student to introduce themselves.  &quot;Up down up down everybody turn around. Twist twist twist, now place your hands upon the ground.&quot; sang the teacher.  Damon was having fun &quot;dancing&quot; to the song as he followed along with the movements of the teacher and the instructions of the song.  When the song stopped, she asked the students what letter was on the dry erase board after she wrote it up there.  Damon knew the letter was in his name, but he couldn&#39;t figure out what the name of it was.  He heard the other students yell out &quot;D&quot; in unison.  The teacher then asked the class what color it was .  &quot;Red!&quot;, shouted Damon right along with the other students.  The teacher then called out a student to tell  the class his name something he liked.  He said, &quot;My name is Alex and I like unicorns!&quot;  Damon chuckled and thought the boy was funny for talking strange and liking unicorns.  The teacher noticed Damon&#39;s laugh and asked Alex, &quot;Where did you used to live before coming here and why do you like unicorns?&quot;  The boy replied, &quot;I lived in Scotland.  I saw unicorn flags on army boats!  My daddy worked on one.&quot;  The teacher was impressed with this kid&#39;s intelligence.  She didn&#39;t understand why a unicorn flag would be on an army boat, but the kid knew that the Scottish navy regularly flew Unicorn flags.  Damon thought the boy was crazy, but it did peak his curiosity.  He&#39;d have to ask the boy later where Scotland is and why an army boat would have a unicorn flag.  After a while, the class transitioned over to doing worksheets.  Damon sat next to Ryan at a table in the shape of a horseshoe.  They had to figure out which order things happened in.  First they cut out the pictures and then they arranged them in order.  When the teacher pointed out that the boy in one of the pictures was putting on his shoes before putting on his socks, both Ryan and Damon laughed and thought it was funny.  After worksheet time, the teacher came up to Damon and asked him if he needed to use the restroom.  Damon said no, but the teacher insisted anyway.  So, Damon got up an followed the teacher to where the bathroom was and entered it while the teacher waited outside.  He locked the door.  He then pulled down his shorts and training pants and sat on the small toilet.  There was a small yellow stain inside his disposable training pants, but the car&#39;s blue wheels did not fade.  Only a little pee dribbled out of him.  He got off the toilet without flushing, pulled up his training pants and shorts, unlocked the door, and exited the bathroom only to be confronted by the teacher again.  &quot;Did you go, Damon?&quot;, asked the teacher.  &quot;A little&quot;, replied Damon.  She then told Damon to go back over to the table and sit next to Ryan again.  She then entered the restroom and shook her head.  &quot;This boy really needs some help.&quot;, she thought.  She grabbed a couple of gloves and put them on.  She then grabbed and container of bleach wipes and pulled one out.  She then flushed the toilet and wiped the seat where Damon dribbled on it a little bit.  She then threw away the wipe, took the gloves off, disposed of them, and noticed the sink was dry.  Damon had not washed his hands.  She didn&#39;t let it go, this was a serious health hazard.  She left the bathroom, went up to Damon and asked him to wash his hands.  He once again got up and followed the teacher, this time to a sink in the classroom.  She had turned on the tap, asked Damon to hold out his hands in the shape of a cup and squirted some hand soap in them.  She then asked Damon to sing the ABC song with her while he washed his hands and to continue  to wash his hands until the song ended.  Damon was pleased at this and so while the teacher sang the ABC song he scrubbed his hands until the song finished.  The teacher then turned off the water and handed him a paper towel to dry his hands off with.  she then led him to a trash can to drop his towel and told him to go back to his seat.  As Damon walked back to his seat, the teacher smiled.  He didn&#39;t sing the ABC song and he struggled with hand washing technique, but he tried his best.She then walked back over to where the tables were so that she could instruct the kids on how to behave in free time.  There were several play stations throughout the kindergarten room.  Ryan and Damon went over to the Lego table and pulled out a tub of Lego.  They had built a car and a dinosaur and the car was busy trying to outrun the dinosaur.  After free time, it was lunch time.  The teacher once again pulled the crocodile out of it&#39;s home and asked the students to grab a ring.  Ryan and Damon got two rings side by side and was excited to see what would be for lunch today.  The teacher once again reminded to not let go of the crocodile before she said so.  She didn&#39;t want the crocodile to escape ahead of them.  She then led them to lunch where they were the first class there.  Normally the kids would get their own food, but at this particular school, the kids sat down and the food was served to them.  The teacher pointed to the table closest to the teacher&#39;s table and asked each side of the crocodile to sit down at the table next to the same kids where beside them in the crocodile.  It was a little chaotic at first, but with the help of each other all of the students found themselves in the correct position.  The students didn&#39;t know it, but this was another test, though a very difficult one, to see if the kids could remember where they were in the crocodile and relate it to where they were to be seated at the table.  It also tested the kids&#39; ability to cooperate with each other, settle disputes, and help each other out without discrimination.  The teacher would rate the process a grade &quot;C&quot;, though prekindergartners didn&#39;t get grades.  A lunch lady wheeled out a food trolley and place a tray of food in front of each student.  A hotdog, fries, sliced apples and milk, this was a good food tray for Damon.  The teacher helped some of the students open their milk cartons because they couldn&#39;t figure it out.  Damon was one of them.  After lunch, it was time to leave because today, the first day, was a short day.  Damon was shepherded back to his bus and directed to a different seat with a different kid.  This kid didn&#39;t talk much and so Damon looked out the window and thought a bit.  With his adult mind having been returned to him, he honestly thought he had a good day.  However, he was lonely.  Being single for a long time, he wanted company or even a family.  When he got home, he grabbed his car keys and headed over to Madame Illusia&#39;s tent.  Again, he entered Madame&#39;s tent and approached the stage.  Currently, there was a donkey on stage, he knew to wait until Madame called him up.  When the donkey was led off by a stage hand, Damon walked up on stage.  Hello, Damon.  I didn&#39;t expect you to come back so early.  Are you not happy with your time a Pre-K?&quot; asked Madame.  &quot;Actually, Madame, I&#39;m lonely and have been single for a long time.  I was wondering if I could be Ryan&#39;s little brother for a few days to see if that family would work out for me.  While at my new home, I&#39;d like to retain my adult  body and mind, but be treated as Ryan&#39;s little brother.  However, when I&#39;m a school, I&#39;d like to be adult in body, but Pre-K in mind.&quot; said Damon.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t do that for you.  Not if you want to keep your special race car disposable training pants and be younger than Ryan.  Would you settle for being Ryan&#39;s two year old brother while keeping your adult body and mind and be enrolled at daycare with your adult body and two-year old mind?  You could go through potty training from the very bottom again so that you&#39;ll get to keep your precious training pants.&quot; replied Madame.  Damon thought about it.  He liked his cool training pants and the idea of starting over with potty training seemed interesting, but did he really want to be a toddler?  Wouldn&#39;t that be humiliating?  Probably not since his family would think he&#39;s two.  Why not give it a try?  He has nothing to lose.  &quot;Yes, madame, I accept your conditions except one thing.  I want to lose all of my potty training both at school and with my new family.  &quot;Excellent, I can agree with that, but you&#39;re temporarily going to have to wear a diaper until you get home.  When you get there, you&#39;ll have some shopping to do.&quot;, said Madame.  With a flick of her wrist, Damon&#39;s polo shirt lost the name of the school and the grade.  Then his shorts disappeared.  His training pants thickened up and grew tabs that stuck in place.  The smiling red car that Damon was so fond of disappeared while a yellow bunny rabbit in a diaper drinking a bottle replaced it.  It didn&#39;t take long for Damon to soak that diaper much to his disgust.  She then teleported Damon&#39;s car back to his house while Damon was teleported away to stay with his new family.   The crowd laughed at the ridiculousness of it all.  But Damon didn&#39;t hear any of that.  In the blink of an eye, he was sitting in a crib in an unknown nursery in an unknown house.  An unknown woman walked in with Ryan.  &quot;Mummy, mummy!  Diaper wet!&quot;, Damon said as babyish as he could, though he could of just said in his adult voice that he needed changing.  Mummy somehow lifted Damon out of his crib and set him down on his changing table for his final diaper.  Afterwards, she wanted to take Damon to a department store to pick out some training pants and a training potty.  Little did he know, his mummy worked at a special ed school taking care of a special seven year old girl that enjoyed laying in her crib and looking up at her newborn mobile even though she was nearly blind.</p>
