<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...There were a lot of issues going on. It was becoming obvious to the physically younger people that they hadn&#39;t quite retained their complete mental faculties. Babies were mostly aware, but seemed foggy and many thought that several would forget their old lives like how barely anyone could remember their very early years. Kylie was aware that she suffered from numerous mental tricks that could fool most every little kid because of how their brains were developing. Mike seemed to be mostly in the clear on that point.<br />
Secondly came the issue of roles and reclaiming &quot;lost&quot; knowledge. Most people tended to remember their past lives and the knowledge they had gained, but since a lot of it was specialized... Many imagined tech would advance significantly faster, but not as fast near instant. For things that were more artistic you could remake a lot of things, but that would take time. Plus if someone important had lost their memories... well that was that. Then came questions about education. Everyone who hadn&#39;t already gotten to an age where they&#39;d be expected to complete high school was currently 3 or under and weren&#39;t enrolled in school at all or in a mental capacity to really be learning high school stuff... but you also couldn&#39;t just shut down the school system entirely, and by the time debates and votes came in and did everything the next generation of students who actually needed to learn something would be in... Not to mention the 1%ers who didn&#39;t retain anything and would need actual education... Add in conspiracy theorists who were trying to figure out what happened to make the world the way it was, corporations that may or may not technically exist trying to enforce patents/copyright they technically couldn&#39;t prove they owned, whether or not to allow kids to work certain types of jobs since mentally they were adults but... they weren&#39;t. Some trolls calling all teens having sex pedos since they were all over 18 mentally but under 18... Economic turmoil... People demanding the money they used to have brought back despite the wealth they had accumulated not having been earned yet. <br />
<br />
 The Harpers were lucky all things considered. John had retained most of his assets from his job thanks to the weird position switch thing, and as far as things seemed initially gender swapping seemed to not incur transness issues... Rachel&#39;s biggest issues were watching over kids... and wondering if she was pregnant over the drunken enjoyment of the first night. If she was... She&#39;d cross that bridge when she came to it. For all the kids who had been wiped out by time... Some people were seeing if they could be brought back early, and there were reports of couples who had kids or gotten pregnant around this time got REALLY horny all of a sudden. It would take years before anything could really be confirmed, but it wasn&#39;t keeping people from testing things out. <br />
<br />
Kylie was currently watching a magical girl anime with Angelica and Bianca. None of the three of them had watched it before as Kyle didn&#39;t watch magical girl shit, and the other two thought it was nerdy/beneath them... but it was child appropriate material that could maybe bridge some gap between the three... Well the two of Kylie and Angelica as Bianca was still cold on Kylie. When Angelica had gone to the bathroom her parents had asked Kylie and Bianca to stay with her... Maybe she&#39;d get better... but she&#39;d also need a lot of help in the coming years, and they thought that maybe Kylie could be a more stabilizing influence to keep Angelica from being a stuck up as she was. Kylie was still mulling that thought over since this was practically babysitting... and the question would become how long till Angelica really understood what was going on in the world. <br />
<br />
John and Mike were playing catch at the park like father and son. They had never really bonded with John mostly being at work and Mindy doing her own stuff with mom and the gals, but they seemed to be getting something going. They were throwing, catching, occasionally talking, and them figuring they&#39;d have more time together in the short term... as work was figuring out the org chart and the quittings and hirings, and what they could currently do &quot;legally&quot;. Mike was thinking maybe he&#39;d join a sports team... since school was becoming a bit more of a &quot;suggestion&quot; these days. <br />
<br />
People were adapting, rebuilding, and searching. Perhaps for a new purpose if their lives had gone off track, perhaps for whatever triggered this massive change, or just to reclaim what had been lost... or to keep what had been lost buried in the possibility of maybe occurring again. </p>
