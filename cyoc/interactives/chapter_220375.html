<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie waited until she turned a corner and the bar was out of her rear view mirror before saying anything.  &quot;Thanks for your help back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan stewed in his seat.  &quot;I&#39;m still pissed at that guy.  He had <i>no right</i> to touch you.  If I was in my old body, I&#39;d probably have pushed him down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like your old body&#39;s coming back.  You&#39;ve already got your voice back, right on schedule...and at the perfect time too.  You sure scared the fuck out of that guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan laughed wearily.  &quot;Yeah.  I didn&#39;t know my voice was back.  I guess I got lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and that&#39;s the first step in reverting to normal.  Going in reverse order of what we put on, your upper body is next, then mine, then our legs, your head and my arms, then finally your arms and my head.  My body parts should revert around the same time, but at least the changes will be less significant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan looked down at his current body looking for any hint of change.  &quot;I hope I don&#39;t bust out of your shirt like The Incredible Hulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan glanced over at Joan.  &quot;That top has a little stretch to it, but the bra you&#39;re wearing doesn&#39;t have much give.  If you feel like you&#39;re starting to &#39;hulk out&#39;, let me know and I&#39;ll pull over fast and help you get the bra off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Joan while continuing to look at his body.  &quot;It was probably ten minutes after I put the dress on that you fastened the choker around my neck, so we&#39;ve got a few minutes left.&quot;  Joan thought back to the altercation outside the bar.  &quot;Does that happen a lot?  Guys trying to force themselves on you like that guy back there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie tensed up and grabbed the steering wheel tighter.  &quot;I wish I could say that was the first time, but it&#39;s not.  It doesn&#39;t happen often, but it still happens too often.  Even if the incidents are years apart, they&#39;re all burned into my mind and I&#39;ll never forget them or how those guys made me feel.  It&#39;s hard knowing that it can happen at any time or any place and maybe one of those times I won&#39;t be able to get away or won&#39;t have someone to help resist.&quot;  Katie was angry, but also on the verge of tears.<br />
<br />
Joan reached over and put his hand on her shoulder.  &quot;Oh my god, Katie.  I&#39;m so sorry.  I wish there was something I could do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head and wiped her watery eyes with a finger.  &quot;No, it&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m okay.  I&#39;m glad you were there for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan angrily replied, &quot;It&#39;s <i>not</i> okay, but I&#39;ve got your back!&quot;  He rubbed her shoulder.<br />
<br />
They drove in silence for a couple minutes until Katie turned onto her street.  &quot;I think we&#39;re actually going to make it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan looked down at himself.  He could feel something happening.  &quot;Maybe not...&quot;  He looked out the car windows and saw the empty street and decided nobody was watching.  &quot;I&#39;m going to take this shirt off now so I don&#39;t rip it.&quot;  He pulled the red blouse over his head and onto his lap.<br />
<br />
Katie drove as quickly as she could down the street.  &quot;Can you get the bra off or do you need help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan tried reaching behind his back, but couldn&#39;t get the hooks undone.  &quot;I can&#39;t...quite...  Ugh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try pulling it off like a shirt,&quot; Katie suggested.<br />
<br />
Joan crossed his arms behind his head and grabbed the straps and pulled up.  He could feel his torso growing in size between the seat and seatbelt and knew he had to hurry.  The bra was caught on his breasts.  He lifted it up over his breasts and tried again.  His arms hit the roof of the car as he bent forward and pulled the bra over his head.  He looked down and watched as his breasts quickly reduced in size to the hairy chest he was used to.<br />
<br />
Katie glanced over.  &quot;Wow!  Got that off just in time!  If only we left a few minutes earlier or that thug didn&#39;t block our path.  You&#39;d have been able to revert inside.&quot;  Katie pulled up to her house and parked.  &quot;We&#39;re here.  Let&#39;s get inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie rushed to the door and unlocked it.  Joan got out of the car and held the bra and blouse against his chest.  With the sound of his heels on the pavement, he quickly hurried up to the door and rushed inside.  Katie followed him inside, closed the door, and locked it.<br />
<br />
Joan was breathing heavily.  &quot;We made it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and I can feel my shirt tightening already.  I&#39;m changing back too.&quot;  Katie and Joan watched as Katie&#39;s waist got a little larger, but Joan made sure not to comment on it.  As the changes completed, Katie&#39;s shirt was more tight-fitting.  She tugged at the bottom and looked at Joan.  &quot;Does this make me look fat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan hesitated for a moment.  &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie poked Joan in the arm.  &quot;I&#39;m kidding!  I&#39;m self-aware enough to know I&#39;ve got a few extra pounds.  I will say, it was nice not having those for a few hours.  I felt so nice and thin!  I haven&#39;t felt like that since my early college days.&quot;  She smiled at Joan.  &quot;Although I suppose you haven&#39;t been that thin since maybe middle school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan shrugged.  &quot;Yeah, probably.  Let&#39;s go up to your bedroom so I can change back into my clothes as these changes revert.  I&#39;d also like to get out of these heels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie agreed and lead the way upstairs to her room.  She sat on the end of her bed and kicked her heels off before laying flat on her back.<br />
<br />
Joan put the blouse he borrowed on the bed and put his T-shirt on.  He sat on the end of the bed next to Katie and shook the heels off his feet.  He looked down at his legs.  He was still wearing Katie&#39;s black skirt.  &quot;I guess it&#39;ll be your legs next, then mine.&quot;  He looked over for any sign of Katie&#39;s legs changing.<br />
<br />
Katie sat up quickly.  &quot;Wait.&quot;  She stared blankly at her skirt and then quickly pulled it up.  &quot;Oh shit.&quot;  She looked over at Joan&#39;s legs exposed beyond the bottom of the black skirt.  &quot;Oh <i>fuck!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan looked at Katie.  Her panic made him start to panic too.  &quot;What?  What&#39;s wrong?  Is the change starting?  Do you feel okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head.  &quot;No, it&#39;s not starting.  That&#39;s the problem.  We forgot that I got these pantyhose from the store too.  We never took them off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan&#39;s eyes opened wide as she realized the problem.  &quot;So if we never took them off, the clock is still running...  Katie, we&#39;ve been wearing these for over four hours now!  If we take them off now, our legs won&#39;t be back to normal until after 3 in the morning.  Maybe as late as 4!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie rested her elbows on her lap and put her face in her palms.  &quot;Oh my god, I&#39;m so sorry, John.  I wasn&#39;t thinking.&quot;  She moaned with aggravation.  &quot;I mean, for me there&#39;s not a problem.  I&#39;ll have great looking legs for a while.  No big deal.&quot;  She looked up at her boyfriend.  &quot;I&#39;m <i>so</i> sorry!  You&#39;ll be stuck like this a while longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan sighed.  &quot;That&#39;s okay.  Don&#39;t worry about it.  I should have thought of it too.  And it&#39;s not permanent.  I suppose I can go tonight without the wild sex we planned.  You can make it up to me in the morning.&quot;  He put his feminine arm around Katie&#39;s shoulder and pulled her close to his masculine chest.<br />
<br />
Katie tilted her head over and gave him a peck on the cheek.  &quot;Deal.  However, right now, we should get these pantyhose off or else you&#39;ll be without your dick for even longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan stood up and pulled up the skirt.  He pulled down the pantyhose.  As it was removed from his legs, he shook them out straight and handed them to Katie who had also removed the pantyhose she was wearing.  &quot;I&#39;ll keep wearing your panties for the time being...if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie grinned as she put the pantyhose away.  &quot;No, go right ahead.  If you want to change out of that skirt, help yourself to anything.  I&#39;ve got some nice soft pajamas if you want to try those.  If you want some jeans, there&#39;s some in the drawer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan had sat back down on the bed and was rubbing his legs.  &quot;I think I&#39;ll stay in this.  I like how my legs feel.  They&#39;re so smooth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve never shaved your legs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  Why would I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shrugged.  &quot;I dunno.  I guess I assumed that guys did it sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think swimmers do to lower the drag in the water.  Maybe some sports where they need to tape up their ankles or knees or something.&quot;  Joan tried to think of other situations.  &quot;Some other situations, I suppose...but for the most part, guys don&#39;t shave down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked at her phone.  &quot;I think we&#39;re coming up on time for your head and my arms to change.&quot;  She held out an arm and watched the green nail polish.<br />
<br />
Joan got up and looked in the full length mirror on the back of the bedroom door.  About a minute later, his curly hair seemed to rapidly uncurl and become shorter while his face seemed to grow and become more masculine.  In just seconds, he was looking at his own familiar reflection, but he was still wearing makeup.  He looked over at Katie.  &quot;Your boyfriend&#39;s back!  ...and he&#39;s wearing makeup.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked up and laughed.  &quot;Great!&quot;  She rushed over and gave him a big kiss.  &quot;I missed you!&quot;  She looked back at her arm.  &quot;My arm should be changing back any moment now.  The nail polish color should be the most obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked at her nails and then checked his own.  He still had the French manicure on feminine hands attached to slender arms coming out of the sleeves of his T-shirt.  It was quite the odd look.  As he took a close look at his hands, he noticed them start to swell up.  He flipped his palm over and watched his fingernails receding.  &quot;Oh, my hands and arms are changing back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked over to witness the change.  &quot;Wait, why are yours changing first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I put the gloves on seconds before you,&quot; John recalled.  &quot;Maybe there&#39;s a little wiggle room in the time to change where it&#39;s not exact?&quot;  His arms had returned to their regular size with a lot more hair than he had moments ago.  &quot;My arms are back.  Other than our lower halves, all that&#39;s left are your arms and head.&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment later, John noticed Katie&#39;s hair growing longer.  &quot;Your hair is changing!&quot;<br />
<br />
As John pointed it out, Katie started to feel it creep down the back of her neck past her shoulders.  She reached up and felt it.  By the time she had walked over to the mirror, her face and hair had returned to normal.  She felt her cheek.  &quot;My face is back to normal.  Why haven&#39;t my hands changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure they haven&#39;t changed?  Maybe it just left the nail polish behind?&quot; John theorized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see your hands.&quot;  John held up his hands and Katie held them while she looked at his fingernails.  &quot;Your French manicure is gone.  I don&#39;t see any nail polish on your hands.&quot;  She returned to looking at her own hands.  &quot;They seem slightly thinner than before.  Pretty sure it&#39;s not just nail polish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you have slimmer arms and free green nail polish.  Is that such a big deal?&quot; John asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not that which concerns me.  What if this happens to our legs?  More importantly, to your crotch?&quot;<br />
<br />
John quickly realized Katie had a valid cause for concern.  &quot;Oh.  Yeah, that would be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie sighed.  &quot;Sorry to make you worry.  It&#39;s probably fine.&quot;  She put her arm on John&#39;s back.  &quot;Come to the bathroom and I&#39;ll remove that makeup.&quot;</p>
