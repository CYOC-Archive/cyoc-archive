<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My dorm room was feeling far too cramped. It just felt like I could barely move at all. Everything around me felt tiny. I needed to get out. I threw on a shirt and pulled up some shorts but didn&#39;t feel underwear was necessary at all. Then stepped into some of my massive flipflops and headed outside. Even as I walked through the doorway, I had to duck and twist a bit to actually fit through it. It was the same with the hallways outside. They felt absolutely tiny. My shoulders felt like they were just about touching both sides as I walked down the hall. Anyone coming the other way would have to step aside to let me through. <br />
<br />
My big dick swung back and forth in my shorts like a pendulum. People were looking at me as I passed. I wondered if it was because of that or just because of how big I was. Or maybe it was that extra little bit I&#39;d added about guys being submissive to me. A wicked grin crossed my face at the possibility. It wasn&#39;t until I felt someone bump into me that it disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro! Watch where you&#39;re fucking going,&quot; I instantly recognized the voice. It was Zach. The guy had a bit of a mean streak that he would use mostly for football. However, it would &#39;occasionally&#39; leak out into the real world. Coach figured out a few ways to keep it quiet and recorded only as &#39;occasional&#39; bad attitude, though most people knew to stay out of his way. At 6&#39;6&quot; I never thought I&#39;d be looking down at the big linebacker. But here we were.<br />
<br />
I puffed up my chest. &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said--&quot; Zach cut himself off as he looked up from his phone. His eyes looked down at first, only to slowly raise. It was like he couldn&#39;t believe that someone could be that big. Only slowing down the higher he had to look. His eyes finally met mine and I could almost hear a &#39;gulp&#39; as his Adam&#39;s apple bobbed in his neck. &quot;Nothing...&quot; his confidence wavered as he tried to keep walking. That wasn&#39;t going to happen.<br />
<br />
I reached out and grabbed his shoulder, squeezing it. Just enough pressure to give him a hint. &quot;No. I heard you say something,&quot; I said. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Zach apologized. &quot;I said sorry for not watching where I was going.&quot; He almost looked like he was trying to shrink in on himself. The big broad-shouldered linebacker who was almost always ready for a fight, voice was soft as he tried to get out of the situation. Even though he was a strong dude, didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t know when he was outmatched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh...&quot; I wagged my finger in his face. &quot;That&#39;s not what I heard...&quot;<br />
<br />
His mouth dropped. &quot;L-look man, I&#39;m sorry alright. I didn&#39;t mean to bump into you. I wasn&#39;t watching where I was going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; my devious smirk returned. Watching him beg was kind of fun. He really only did like starting fights he knew he could win. The thought of him trying to get out of the situation was getting me hard. I jostled my cock in my shorts and watched his eyes drop down to it. I could almost read his mind as he saw the massive fuck stick between my legs. &quot;You want to apologize?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro. I&#39;m sorry I bumped into you. I&#39;ll watch where I&#39;m going from now on,&quot; Zach said.<br />
<br />
My grip loosened off his shoulder for a second. I could see a smile fill his face. Though, I wasn&#39;t done yet. &quot;Alright, come with me.&quot; I said. Then leaned over and threw him onto my shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHA--&quot; he nearly screamed. Never in his life had he been this easily picked up, let alone moved. More surprising was how almost light the 280 pound jock was. I almost wondered if I&#39;d gotten even bigger. With each step he almost felt like he was getting lighter. I felt my dick growing rock hard, and then his as well. It brushed against my shoulder as I carried him to a vacant classroom. People stared, pointed and some even laughed as his body seemed to go limp, not fighting my grasp on him. <br />
<br />
As I set him down, I watched him look up at me again. His hand was almost actively trying to suppress his dick. &quot;I... I feel funny...&quot;<br />
<br />
I let out a single laugh, taunting him. &quot;Cause you finally found a man able to treat you like the bitch you are?&quot; Then tossed up a flex. I watched his eyes bulge at the size and definition of the arm. &quot;Undress,&quot; I ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; he backed away for a second, though his hand were already on his shorts. And with that step, he&#39;d kicked off one of his shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to do it for you?&quot; I demanded, grabbing his shirt. A small ripping sound filled the silence as seam by seam started to separate.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Zach stammered as he dropped his shorts and underwear. I let go of him, and his shirt was next to come off. He was a fairly built guy. A bit more fat than he needed to properly be a lineman, but the size was more important than the definition. Size meant strength, but I had more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look how small you are,&quot; I laughed at his dick. For most people it would have been average, but I wasn&#39;t about to pay him anything close to a complement. Even funnier was watching it bounce with excitement as I pointed it out. His face was going red as he tried to cover it up. &quot;No,&quot; I commanded. &quot;You don&#39;t hide anything from me.&quot; His body instantly straightened up.<br />
<br />
&quot;But--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts,&quot; I growled. &quot;There&#39;s only one I care about.&quot; I dropped my own shorts, showing off the hard log swinging between them. It was absolutely massive as it swung between my legs. Thick as a beer can and nearly hanging halfway down my leg. Still impressive with how tall I&#39;d gotten.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t fit that!&quot; Zach stared, open mouthed.<br />
<br />
I let out another condescending laugh. &quot;We&#39;ll see...&quot; Pre was already leaking out of it as I crossed the few feet between us. I spun him around and shoved him against the wall. It was so easy. He wasn&#39;t fighting it at all. If anything, he spun with my force, slamming his hands against the plaster to show the difference in our power. His ass pushed out from behind him. I smiled, placing my dripping cock between his cheeks. &quot;That&#39;s a good boy...&quot; Then slowly pushed in.<br />
<br />
He let out a whimper as he was being split open. It was the perfect amount of pressure. Not too much resistance, but enough to make him really feel it. His body flexed under the feeling. Fingers clawing at the wall. It was still just my head barely making it in. But I could feel his body starting to thrust. &quot;You don&#39;t finish until I tell you.&quot; Instantly he tightened up. A needy whine filled his throat. He was really grasping at the wall now. Trying to find anything to help him hold on. <br />
<br />
My smirk turned into a full-on smile as I felt him do as I said. My hefty body leaned more onto him. Arms wrapping around his body as one hand felt his body and the other went for his dick. &quot;God you&#39;re soooo small,&quot; I whispered, sneering into his ear. &quot;Barely anything to even grab onto. My hand can&#39;t even hold it...&quot; I continued to jerk him off as I slowly pushed further. Inch by inch it rearranged his insides, slowly widening him up even more. My finger rounded his balls, feeling them tense as I touched them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please what?&quot; I whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please let me finish,&quot; Zach begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; I stalled. My body had hit his ass. &quot;Let&#39;s see... I think someone needs to learn some patience.&quot; I started pumping slightly feeling his body grasp tightly around my dick. &quot;You always have so many anger problems when you have to wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach gasped for air. His body wasn&#39;t listening to him anymore. But he knew he couldn&#39;t finish. He must have been right on the edge. Each pump of my body making him hornier and hornier as I felt my dick throb inside of him. But it felt so good. I&#39;d never felt such a perfect hole before. It gripped me perfectly. Each thrust felt better than the last. I didn&#39;t want to stop, because taunting him was so much fun.<br />
<br />
But hearing Zach whimper out another, &quot;Please,&quot; was too much. I gripped his shoulders and released into his body. Copious amounts of cum filled his insides as I thrust more wildly than I had before. His body took it, but then started to leak. I pulled out and stood a few feet away watching it drip out of him. But then he looked over his shoulder. &quot;Now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put your clothes on,&quot; I tossed him his shirt, underwear and shorts. He pulled them up over his legs. &quot;Now you can finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes nearly went to the back of his head as his knees gave over. I caught him before he hit the ground too hard. But he still looked like he was having a pretty good time as a clear and present stain appeared both in front of his shorts and behind. He finally stood up. The realization of what happened made his mild embarrassment double. His face turned bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more bullying,&quot; I ordered. Zach nodded passively. &quot;You&#39;re not allowed to change those shorts or shower, until tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my girlfriend?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about her?&quot; I stared, glaring more menacingly. &quot;Should I make it all week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; he slunk down at the suggestion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; I let out a smile knowing full well he&#39;d do it.</p>
