<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Thomas left his house, he was astounded by what was happening on the streets. Animals of all kind and sizes were rampaging everywhere. On nearest neighbor&#39;s front yard, a stag was jumping without control, next to it was a couple of mooses making loud and terrifying screams, in front of his house an alligator was opening and closing its mouth repeatedly. In the air, a lot of birds flew at any direction like if they didn&#39;t know where to go.<br />
Thomas was terrified of what he saw, he had thought his family was the only one which had changed but it seems that it had happened on all the town. He tried to look for something to do, but it was a complete chaos that he didn&#39;t have any idea. Then, he felt a tickling on his feet and when he saw down him he discovered a few squirrels running between his feet. At that moment, he remembered what had happened to him. His feet were now as big as hobbit feet and tanned. His legs looked like tree trunks.<br />
He was distracted until he heard the same scream from before, it wasn&#39;t an animal but definetely a human. He thought that the person could be in danger, so he followed the screams direction. He was followed by George, very close to him as if he was a guardian dog. With Thomas&#39; bigger muscles and George&#39;s dog shape they were able to move a mile in mater of minutes.<br />
They arrived to a small shop where a lot of animals were trying to get the fruit and meat that were inside. Hyenas, wolfs, chimpazees, even rhinos were trying to enter the building. Thomas realized the screams were coming from there, so he looked for a way to get in without crossing with those animals. While he was thinking, George followed a scent that lead him to a small vent behind the building, he returned to his brother to alert him about it. Thomas followed him but quickly they realized the vent was too small for Thomas new size.<br />
&quot;You can go inside, George&quot; Thomas said. &quot;I will help you to get in&quot;<br />
Thomas moved a dumpster until George was able to jump it and get inside the vent.<br />
After walking through a short way, George landed on a warehouse fulled with food, he was tempted to eat some of the sausages over there, but he was able to contain his animal instincts. He began to sniff the place until he smelled a peculiar scent. He followed it until he reach a young boy not bigger than 6 years old cornered above some boxes. He was surrounded by a couple of snakes which were trying to reach the boy but the kid didn&#39;t stopped throwing things to them. George knew that it was matter of minutes that those snakes could reach the kid and eat him. He hadn&#39;t time to open the door to his brother, either. So, he was brave and jumped over the snakes and uses his sharp teeth to drive those snakes away. Then, he jumped over the boxes until he reach the little kid who was too scared to look at him.<br />
George knew that he can&#39;t take the kid with him, so he quickly went to open a door near to where Thomas was. When the door was opened, Thomas entered and saved the little kid.<br />
&quot;Now, you&#39;re safe&quot; Thomas said to him. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
&quot;Cody&quot; The kid said. &quot;Do you know what&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
&quot;No&quot; Thomas said. &quot;But I will figure it out.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your dog?&quot; Cody said as he pointed to George.<br />
&quot;No, he&#39;s my brother, George.&quot; Thomas answered.<br />
&quot;My dad and uncles had turned into animals too.&quot; Cody said. &quot;They are those snakes. They were working at the store when they began to scream and turn into those snakes. I was too scared that I climbed those boxes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Thomas said. &quot;I&#39;m here and I will protect you.&quot;<br />
&quot;You promise?&quot; Cody said. &quot;I&#39;m too scared, out there are too much animals that want to come in and eat me!&quot;<br />
Thomas nodded and carried the kid over his shoulders. He wondered how strong he was now. Cody told him that he know a secret exit above the store. So, Thomas went to there and they arrived to the store&#39;s roof. He thought that having a higher view of the town could help him to look a place to hide, but what he saw astounded too much that he shacked a little.<br />
The town was full with animals. In the streets, in every corner, above the sky and even over the electricity cables were animals of all kind. It was like if the town had turned into a zoo.<br />
&quot;We need a safe place to hide. Where animals can&#39;t go in&quot; Thomas said. He looked for a while until he saw the perfect place. &quot;There! We can hide in the high school!&quot; Cody and George agree with him, and they began their travel to the high school.</p>
