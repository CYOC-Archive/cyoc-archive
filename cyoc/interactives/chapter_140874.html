<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Running across the hallway, Ty passed by the 5th graders&#39;s room which was as noisy as always. Ty saw an asian kid who was about 10 or so, looking at his other classmate. Ty noticed that he was smiling and his cheeks are turning red. Curious, Ty went to check who the kid was looking at and noticed that it was that other boy in front. Seems like the kid has feeling for him. Upon seeing him, Ty decided to ditch class and do something much interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I&#39;m old enough to be these kids&#39; teacher.&quot; Ty said and he immediately grew in height and age. His clothes did not tore, but instead they changed into a much appropriate clothes for a teacher. After a few seconds, Ty became a 30 year old man wearing a semi formal attire. He was carrying a book with no label on it and a clipboard. He went in and immediately got greeted by the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning, Mr. Ty!&quot; Everybody exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled and placed his book on top of the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Ty! Are we going to learn about the planets today?&quot; One of the students asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No. Actually. I just came to talk to some kids.&quot; Ty pointed at the Asian kid from before. &quot;You.&quot; He said, not knowing his name. He then wished to know their names to make it easier. &quot;Charles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir?&quot; The kid stood up. He was a pale skinned kid about 4 feet and 10 inches with a brown curly hair.<br />
<br />
Ty then pointed at the other kid whom Charles was looking at before. &quot;And Tom.&quot; Tom then looked at Ty. &quot;Please come with me. We need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nervous, the kids followed Ty outside. Ty walked down the halls with the kids until they reached a different door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that once we enter this door, we will get teleported to my room, and they will not react.&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay come in.&quot; Ty then opened the door and theh all went in.<br />
<br />
They were magically transported to Ty&#39;s room. Ty sat on his bed while the kids stand in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay here&#39;s the catch.&quot; He said and they looked at him. &quot;Charles. I&#39;ve noticed that you&#39;ve been looking at Tom frequently. What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles&#39;s eyes widened and he blushed. &quot;N-Nothing sir...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom just looked at Charles, confused of what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. It&#39;s okay actually. I want you to confess your feelings right now. I know it&#39;s been hard to keep it inside. I&#39;m here to help you let go of that feeling.&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... Mr. Ty, Charles has a crush on me?&quot; Tom reacted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom. Please. I wish that you will not react negatively about this and just listen to Charles for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay sir...&quot; Tom said and his voice softens.<br />
<br />
Charles faced Tom. Still shy and nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now Charles. Say it to Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom.. I think I like you...&quot; Charles obeyed Ty. He then looked away as his cheeks burned.<br />
<br />
Tom on the other hand was blushing as well. He cannot react negatively so he had no other will but to conform. &quot;Thank you...&quot; The kid said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Charles. Do you feel better?&quot; Ty asked <br />
<br />
&quot;No... sir...&quot; Charles answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see... So do you wanna do something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles&#39;s eyes once again widened as he got what Ty was talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Charles. A kiss wont hurt.&quot; Ty commanded and Charles went in for a peck and turned back afterwards due to the immense nervousness he was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was not a kiss Charles.&quot; Ty said in a very soft tone. &quot;Kiss Tom properly.&quot; He grinned.<br />
<br />
Charles and Tom faced each other. Charles&#39;s cheeks were so red that he looked like he has a fever. But Charles couldn&#39;t do anything but to follow. Charles placed a hand around Tom&#39;s neck and pulled him for a kiss.<br />
<br />
Ty was amused to see two 10-year-olds kissing each other. There was no movement yet to Ty made another command.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now don&#39;t stop.&quot; Ty said. &quot;I want you two to start aging mentally. I want you two to both think like 20-year-olds&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately, their heads moved. Charles&#39;s tounge was intertwining with Tom&#39;s. They were kissing wildly which was eerie to see being done by two kids. Then both began to groan and Tom started cussing like an adult. Charles was removing Tom&#39;s shirt, exposing his childish torso. Tom was a bit chubby especially since he&#39;s still a kid. Tom was doing the same. He was unbuckling his belt and pushing his pants down, showing his spiderman underwear. Soon, Tom was naked and is removing Charles&#39;s clothes.<br />
<br />
After they get naked, they both went on the bed with Charles on top of Tom. Charles&#39;s lips migrated to Tom&#39;s nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah...&quot; Tom moaned in his childish voice. Which made Ty laugh so hard.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Ty was laughing at two kids trying to make out. Charles was sucking on Tom&#39;s tiny uncircumsized penis while pinching Tom&#39;s nipples with his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Its time for you to start growing up physically to match your mental age. Starting with you, Tom&quot; Ty said and the kid started growing in height.<br />
<br />
Tom reached a height of 6 feet and 2 inches. His muscles packing up and revealing perfect abs. His moans started growing deeper and soon Charles is sucking on a huge cock. Tom was finally 20.<br />
<br />
Next was Charles. His pale skin did not change at all. Same with Tom, he was also tall but taller than Tom by 5 inches. Charles was also muscular but less than Tom. His cock though was bigger than him. Soon the kids are replaced by two men having an oral sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah. I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot; Tom exclaimed and he blew his very first load into Charles&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Charles swallowed and looked back at Tom. He crawled to Tom and went in for another kiss.</p>
