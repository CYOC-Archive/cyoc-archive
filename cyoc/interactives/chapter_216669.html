<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob lowered his stunningly good looking new head down out of the building&#39;s window now that he&#39;d confirmed someone was actually there.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I didn&#39;t have fucking far to walk in these god forsaken heels!&quot; Rob muttered quietly to himself. Jules&#39;s trailer was near the front of the trailer court, so the building had only been about a hundred or so feet away. Still hadn&#39;t stopped him from almost face planting in the mud, though.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t actually just a random building, but a slightly crumbling brick house that had been there long before the rest of the trailer court had. It was the &#39;front office&#39; of Shermer Fields, the first (and sometimes last) thing most people that lived in the sizable collection of dilapidated mobile homes would see. But the owner of the trailer court didn&#39;t live there, instead it was the Superintendent&#39;s house. Whoever actually owned the park was something Rob didn&#39;t actually know, but he&#39;d been to the one story house plenty of times before. Typically it was about yet another endless problem that plagued the run-down Bolstrum family trailer, or to deliver a (typically late) check on behalf of his lazy bitch of a mom. Rob and the Super, Lou Reed, didn&#39;t get along very well, but his wife Peggy was always nice to him, and one of the few adults in Rob&#39;s life that he didn&#39;t feel some form of hatred towards.<br />
<br />
Rob had a plan of sorts. Jules&#39;s dad seemed to recognize the...girl side of him, but who knew how any of this was actually supposed to work? Maybe it was just Jules&#39;s house that made the new switch in his brain flip over and make Rob become &#39;Bobbi&#39;? Or now that he &#39;was&#39; Bobbi...Maybe he lived somewhere else?<br />
<br />
There were just so many questions that Rob had and that little lying shitfuck hadn&#39;t given him any answers. He&#39;d just have to find some himself.<br />
<br />
He grimaced as his new additions bounced with each small step he took up onto the house&#39;s front porch.<br />
<br />
&#39;You got this, Bolstrum&#39; He said to himself as he carefully walked across the positively ancient wood planks that made up the porch, the fading twilight casting long shadows that the single pale yellow bulb did little to get rid of. &#39;You just walk in, ask the Super&#39;s wife where this...bimbo lives, and then you walk out. J ain&#39;t here so you&#39;re not NOT gonna turn into that brain dead cunt, you&#39;re NOT gonna start crying! Just walk in, get directions and walk out. You got this!&#39;<br />
<br />
The former man took a deep breath and tried his best to ignore the rising twin peaks that currently hung off his torso. Their weight was so alien and uneven, how they shifted and bounced inside of the strained fabric of his new t-shirt. He reached out with a hand that felt comically small and gripped the screen door&#39;s handle and with a final burst of adrenaline and false confidence, he pulled the screen door open and marched into the office.<br />
<br />
Of course, the moment the door had swung open, and the moment Peggy&#39;s eyes had spotted Rob as he crossed the threshold, all that confidence vanished as Bobbi returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who...Oh, Bobbi honey, you scared the me!&quot; Peggy said, giving the girl a soft smile. But the smile was short lived as the young woman froze mid-stride, her eyes wide in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh Mrs. Reed, I&#39;m...I&#39;m so sorry I just wasn&#39;t paying attention and...and&quot; Bobbi stuttered as her large green eyes filled with tears. She sniffled and turned away, a hand reaching for the door handle as she swiped a rogue tear away with a mud-stained finger. She felt another one run down her opposite cheek, and a final sniffle was all it took as the waterworks began. Bobbi let loose a sob and her body shuddered as the emotional toll of what had just happened overtook her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Peggy said, rising up from the desk where she had spent...And rather significant amount of her life behind. She rounded the counter and moved towards Bobbi, who she&#39;d seen grow up from a little bean pole into one of the prettiest girls she&#39;d ever seen around Shermer. Now that the counter wasn&#39;t blocking her view, the shorter woman could see that...something had happened to the poor girl; her shapely legs were splattered with mud, her hair was matted in places and she was crying!<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh Mrs. R-reed!&quot; Bobbi sobbed, turning and burying her head into the shoulder of the older woman, &quot;I-I just can&#39;t seem t-to make my b-boyfriend happy! I l-love him so much but h-he won&#39;t let me get close to h-him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey...&quot; Peggy cooed sympathetically, pulling the girl into a tight hug. At least she hadn&#39;t been assaulted or raped, Peggy had always been afraid that one of those would happen to Bobbi, especially given where they lived and ESPECIALLY given where the girl worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s c-cause I&#39;m u-gly isn&#39;t it!?&quot; Bobbi bawled again, and Peggy just let the girl cry as she held her tight, stroking her pudgy, wrinkled hand through her hair and along her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bobbi, you&#39;re not ugly baby, you&#39;re one of the prettiest girls I&#39;ve ever seen! You&#39;ve always been good looking, why when you were younger you were so cute I always thought it was criminal you had to live here!&quot; Peggy said a few minutes later, after Bobbi&#39;s unbridled sobbing had slowed. She pulled the girl off her shoulder and grabbed a handful of tissues from the box on the office counter and went to work dabbing up the Picasso painting that was now smeared across Bobbi&#39;s face from the waterfall of tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but why won&#39;t he love m-me?&quot; Bobbi said with a slight hiccup as she let Peggy clean her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bobbi if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve figured out from all my years on God&#39;s earth is that men don&#39;t have a lick of sense when it comes to women&quot; Peggy said as she finished up, the tissues practically dripping with wasted makeup, &quot;I&#39;ve known men who&#39;d rather sit alone with a video tape and a sock than touch a woman out of fear of makin&#39; a fool outta themselves. That Julian boy doesn&#39;t know how lucky he is that you even look at him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess...&quot; Bobbi said with another sniffle as the last of her tears, for now, dried up. &quot;Thanks, Mrs. Reed, you always know how to make me feel better!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peggy smiled up at the girl and gave her a soft pat on the cheek, &quot;Oh honey, it&#39;s the least I could do. Now c&#39;mon, lets...&quot;<br />
<br />
Option 1: &quot;Get you home, I&#39;ll walk you there&quot; Mrs. Reed takes Bobbi home, back to the Bolstrum mobile home near the back of the trailer court. Peggy is reluctant to leave Bobbi alone, but the young woman assures her that her mom will be home &#39;soon&#39;. The moment Bobbi closes the door, Rob returns...But is he alone?<br />
<br />
Option 2: &quot;Get you out of those muddy clothes! No adoptive daughter of mine is going to be filthy if I can help it!&quot; Bobbi is whisked away by her foster mother, having been adopted by the Reeds three years ago after Bobbi&#39;s mother had skipped town. Peggy helps Bobbi out of her clothes and shoves her into a hot shower, where Rob finally returns.</p>
