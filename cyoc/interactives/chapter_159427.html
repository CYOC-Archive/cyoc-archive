<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they both slept, Sally had all manner of strange dreams. She dreamed about her father, yet she felt he was not her father and she dreamed of a life she had never known.<br />
<br />
The next morning she awoke feeling refreshed and while her father slept she went into the bathroom to examine her new body.<br />
Sally closed and locked the bathroom door and then let her robe fall to the ground along with her sleep wear. She then turned and looked into the mirror. Staring back at her was a middle-aged 45 year old woman with large 36 C-Cup breasts that sagged slightly with large areola’s and erect nipples. Her brown hair was shoulder length cut into a mature “bob cut” and it had a slight m ix of gray and brown giving her almost a “salt and pepper” look. She had crow’s feet on her eyes and slight but noticeable laugh lines around her mouth. She glanced down her body, which was tan, and saw her mid-drift, which was taught and tight from working out, though she still had a slight “muffin top”, which was natural considering her age. Farther down she went when she saw the neatly trimmed bush of hair around her mature pussy. This was new territory for her. She turned around slightly and looked back in the mirror to examine her ass, which she could tell had once been a very round and full “bubble but” and remnants if it still remained, giving her an hour-glass figure though it sagged slightly too. She was obviously starting to lose the contest with time. Her legs were long and still very sexy for a woman her age. Her hands were weathered with neatly red polished fingernails.<br />
Looking back up and taking now all in at once she was amazed. There was now nothing left of that wisp of a tomboy girl who had just been on the cusp of [puberty. “I really do look a lot like Mom, almost as if she had a sister. Thought I have got bigger tits than she and a much leaner body. I must work out my whole adult life to keep this killer bod. Guess that makes me a MILF now, huh?”<br />
<br />
Sally then feels the weight of her breasts as she hefts and cups them in her hands. As she down her fingers accidentally caress her large nipples which sends an electric shock through her body. “Weird, this is so weird.”<br />
She then takes one hand and feels the smoothness of her mid-drift and continued down till she felt the soft downy hair of her pussy. She tingles with excitement as she briefly parted her womanly lips and probed inside and while as pleasurable as that was her two fingers found her clit and she began rubbing it instinctively which sent a wave of immense please through her body as her knee’s almost buckled from the intense pleasure as a massive orgasm swept through her. It was her first orgasm. As she recovered and removed her fingers from the warm and wet pussy she stood back up regaining her footing. “Wow, I think I just took my own virginity!” she laughed quickly to herself.<br />
Sally then got into the shower and enjoyed the warm water as it fell against her very mature and sexy body. As she showered she began to feel more and more at home with her new age and body as she began to move more naturally and gracefully as her hips swished and breasts swayed freely as she stepped out of the shower and walked back over to the mirror and put her robe on.<br />
<br />
The couple got dressed, though in separate rooms as Sally was still feeling a bit self-conscious. They spent the day exploring the resort like a typical husband and wife, then without realizing it, they began holding hands as they explored.<br />
<br />
That evening after dinner, Jason made a suggestion.<br />
“Want to go dancing? I hear there is a nice orchestra playing in the lounge tonight. I know that is not your type of music, but your mother enjoyed it and I thought maybe….”<br />
“I’d love to Jason, I mean Dad.”<br />
“No, Jason is fine and we do need to keep this charade up even if we are alone. Helps to keep us in character.”<br />
“Ok Jason, yes, I think that would be nice. Let me change first.”<br />
Sally got up and went to the closet. The resort also supplied a complete wardrobe for Sally at her new age. She quickly picked out a beautiful light cream colored dress that had a pleated skier that went just above her knees that showed enough leg to tease and it also had a low neckline that showed a great deal of cleavage. She then put in a nice string of pearls to go with it and a deep blue sweat around her shoulders. She was stunning.<br />
“What do you think?” she said as she emerged from the bathroom.<br />
Jason’s jaw dropped. “You look amazing and so beautiful.”<br />
Sally blushed. “Thanks Jason.”<br />
<br />
They then walked hand in hand to the lounge as the orchestra was starting to play the Nina Simone hit “I put a spell on you.”<br />
Jason led Sally to the dance floor and he then took her into his arms and put his hand on her waist and grasped her other hand as he leaned in and whispered, “Just follow my lead Sally.”<br />
<br />
As they slow danced across the floor time seemed to stand still as Sally began to feel stirring’s like she had never felt before. Jason looked different now. It wasn’t her Dad any more but Jason, her handsome husband. She began to feel wet as her nipples hardened and slight beads of sweat formed on her upper lip and she began breathing harder.<br />
Jason felt the same changes as she held this beautiful middle-aged woman in his strong arms. There was no way that this was Sally his little 2 year old tomboy. No. This was Sally his 45 year-old adult wife he was dancing with as he felt her dick come to life as he felt aroused as well as he felt her large breasts pressing against his chest.<br />
<br />
Unconsciously, Jason moved his hand slowly from her waist to the small of her back and then down until he cupped her right but cheek and slightly squeezed it. <br />
<br />
Sally felt an electric shock when he did that and she moaned just loud enough for Jason to hear approvingly. What was she feeling?<br />
The seemed to dance all night together flirting with each other and lightly fondling each other and teasing as well. When they were seating, Sally would slide her skirt up slightly to show off her long and sexy legs or bend down slightly to show off her cleavage as her nipples could be visibly seen poking through the thin fabric of her dress. Jason ordered drinks for the two of them as the night wore on. Sally, who had never had any alcohol in her life began to keep a little tipsy. And so was Jason. Soon they began to head back to their room. Jason stopped though at the beach. They were all alone and the moon was huge and full. He turned Sally towards him as she wrapped her arms around his neck.<br />
<br />
“Why are we stopping here Jason?” she giggled.<br />
“Well, the moon is full, the air warm and I have a beautiful woman in my arms. Why do you think?”<br />
“I don’t know” she teased. “Show me.”<br />
<br />
And with that Jason instinctively leaned in and kissed Sally long and hard. Surprised at first and hesitant she soon melted in his arms as the former inexperienced tween kissed him back as their tongues danced together. Soon they were making out like a couple of teenagers. In Sally’s mind she was now kissing her husband, even though it all felt new like it was the first time. And Jason was convinced he was kissing his new mature wife.<br />
As their lips parted Jason looked deeply into Sally’s eyes and said “Want to go back to the room and continue this?”<br />
That’s when…….<br />
