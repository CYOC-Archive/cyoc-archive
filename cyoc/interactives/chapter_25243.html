<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>The next thing to come into Amy's head was one word; a direct command that screamed through every crevice of her psyche. "ESCAPE!" She couldn't see anything, nor hear. Whether her senses weren't working quite right or she was simply in a soundless, lightless space, she didn't have time to care. She just knew she had to get out of wherever she was.
<P>She frantically moved her limbs, though they were bound together by something. She tried to breathe, but something got stuck in her mouth. Whatever was holding her in was slowly giving way, however, and with more kicking and flailing, she began to feel cool, fresh air hitting her body. She squirmed, feeling that the widening opening was at the lower part of her body, hoping to shimmy out through it. More limbs came free and she clutched the stringy mass that held her in. She easily parted the strands and a bright light flooded her vision.
<P>Blinking and holding an arm to her face, she breathed quickly, enjoying the fresh air. Her body began to tingle with the intake of new oxygen, and her vision slowly cleared. Finally, she began to remember what had happened to her. The wig was attacking her, choking her...then this.
<P>How long she had been out, she didn't know. But at least she was still alive. When her head finally stopped spinning and she could see her room plain as day, she tried to pick herself up. That's when she realized something wasn't right.
<P>Her body felt heavier...and distorted. She was able to push herself up to a sitting position on the floor, but when she looked at her body she gasped.
<P>Bits of clothing were scattered over her body and along the floor, looking as though they had been torn into hundreds of shreds. Her body itself looked very different. It still had a basic human frame to it, but was much, much more alien. Her body was covered by black plates. These fit the form of a humanoid woman, but were segmented like a suit of armor. A large curvy plate sat where her breasts were...if she still had them underneath, she wasn't sure. Lower on her stomach was another one. More oblong plates ran down her legs, all in a rounded geometric style. The divisions between the plates were filled by thick dark brown fur. Amy also noticed that the plates seemed to be separated mostly according to her joints, to allow her to move while still armoring her body--armoring against what, she had no idea.
<P>She brought her arms in front of her to examine them, and let out another gasp when four of them came into view. She waved one at a time, making sure all of them were actually attached to her. They had armor on them as well, with elbow and shoulder joints filled by tough skin covered in brown fur. Her hands were deformed. Each one had two thick fingers and a thumb that also had segmented armor. The fingertips were sharp. Her wrists were accented by thicker tufts of brown fur than the usual armor divisions. She poked the fur, feeling skin underneath.
<P>Her feet were long and digitigrade. Her feet between her ankles and toes was much longer than before. Her two toes were thicker than her fingers, tipped in armored claws but padded on the bottom by tough skin. Amy saw that her entire figure was rather thin, despite the armor and lines of fur.
<P>Now came the most frightening part...she could see her body, but without knowing her face had changed, none of this had truly seemed real. The thought of looking into a mirror chilled her bones, but she knew she had to see what had happened to her. Very carefully, she maneuvered her six limbs and got to a shaky standing position. She turned her head slowly to look in the mirror.
<P>This time, she didn't gasp because she had already prepared herself for the most grotesque face she could imagine. Thus, she was a bit thankful that it didn't look as grotesque as she thought. Her face was a bit thinner, covered by brown fur. Her cheeks, nose and forehead had small geometric plates on them. Her ears were nowhere to be seen, and her eyes were a cold, solid jet black. The room's lamp made a distinct bright reflection in her eyes. Her nose was smaller, barely jutting from the rest of her face. The plate covering it was exposed at the underside, where two slits that still resembled nostrils resided. Her lips were black, and two mandibles poked out from either side of her mouth. They were about three inches long, curved with a razor inner edge. Her teeth had turned into viscious fangs, and her tongue was black and much longer than before. Two thin antennae stood on top of her head. They were black and stretched at least a foot in the air, drooping slightly. They waved about, and Amy realized she could sense them feeding her mind information
<P>Surprisingly, she still had her head of hair. It emerged from behind her face plates, long, wavy and brown. This was the same hair that had coccooned her, but now it seemed back to normal. As usual, it framed her entire body, going all the way to inches above the floor.
<P>Amy looked her body over, again and again. She thought she would break into tears, but never did. Perhaps she no longer had tear ducts. She had no idea what kind of creature she had been changed into, or why. Thoughts of her family and friends filled her mind. Thousands of questions about herself and her future followed. What kind of life was she now forced to have? Was there any hope of changing back? She stood in the same spot, unmoving and staring into the reflection of her large black eyes. To an observer, her still body would give no indication of the raging emotion and turmoil that was taking place inside her mind.</p>
