<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the cabin, Cameron was laying on his back in bed with his eyes closed, completely motionless as he tried to figure out what the hell was going on. Everything was made worse by the fact that his two minds were each struggling with their own questions.<br />
<br />
The young human who had come to the camp the night before was still reeling at the new body he was currently occupying. Every movement he made with this body, every word he spoke, and every idle thought he had felt so… right. Like he’d been using this muscular tanuki body for years. But Cameron knew, deep down, this this wasn’t the truth, that he’d only woken up in this body a mere couple hours ago. Before that he’d been… someone else. Something else. And he’d come here with someone else as well, but the more he tried to remember who, the more the face of that irritating playboy of a cat popped into his mind.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the mind of the teenage tanuki counselor was poring over every man he’d ever hooked up with, trying to place that little sex kitten’s face. Had Cameron been the one to hit on him first, and now the cat was looking to keep the fling going? Or had Elliot made the first move and couldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer? Either way, Cameron desperately wanted the cat to just drop the whole thing and let him do his job. No matter how hot Elliot was, the sleazy feeling he was giving off just felt wrong to Cameron…<br />
<br />
“No, what the hell am I thinking!? I’m not Cameron… I mean, I am, but I’m a different Cameron…” he whispered to himself, not even sure which side of him was talking to which. He thought about the camp, and how he’d wanted to get a chance to learn the basics of coaching little critters this weekend… Or, was it only because he’d been asked to come by someone else? They both seemed so plausible, yet neither seemed right.<br />
<br />
His concentration was broken by the sound of the door slamming shut and tiny paws running across the floorboards. Patrick had come back from his shower, desperately hiding the little erection he still had from his earlier encounter with Zack. The little mouse didn’t even notice that Cameron was still there and leaned up against the mirror, staring at his new body as he desperately jerked off his dick.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t get the images of Zack and Cameron towering over him out of his head, their incredible muscles and packages on full display. He could imagine himself getting cornered in a locker room by the two as they chuckled and started to stroke themselves, making Patrick whimper and get even harder.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, little guy?” he could hear Cameron saying in his fantasy with a lewd grin on his face. “Need some help?”<br />
<br />
Patrick continued to beat off his young cock, trying desperately to stop himself. “I’m not some horny little gay brat…” he thought to himself. “I can stop this… I need to stop this…!” However, his mantra had no effect, and he came right on the floorboards with a squeaky whimper.<br />
<br />
He looked into the mirror and saw the person he was becoming, a slim, effeminate, and petit little mouse boy… No, still a man, not a ‘boy’, no matter how small he was! Those campers out there are kids, but he was still a man, damn it…! He’d applied for this job because he wanted to help them enjoy themselves, to show that he wasn’t some little kid anymore! But, here he was jerking himself off first thing in the morning to some hot guys he’d seen in the showers. He sure felt like a little kid… The little voice in the back of his head that was screaming at him that he was really a grown human man, not some queer little mouse, made him feel even more conflicted, like he didn’t even know who he was anymore…<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, little guy?” Patrick heard a voice from behind him, sounding concerned. “Need some help?”<br />
<br />
He spun around and saw Cameron standing there, looking baffled as to why his roommate had suddenly burst in and came all over the floor. Patrick felt like his face was going to burst into flames, his big round ears turning bright red in embarrassment. His whiskers were twitching uncontrollably, reminding him even more of the strange new body he had found himself occupying that morning. He&#39;d kill for a smoke right now, just to have something to remind him of his old life and his old body. &quot;C-Cam, I... I didn&#39;t...&quot; he stammered, covering himself up and trying to avoid looking his roommate in the eyes (and at the bulge in his shorts). &quot;I-I&#39;m so sorry, but I... I don&#39;t know if I can... I should just go home, maybe...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two sides of Cameron’s mind had to agree on one thing; this little guy was cute. His jock side usually went for guys with a little more meat on them, and the human side of him wasn’t sure if he even liked men at all, but they both agreed that the skinny little mouse was cute. And this agreement between his two minds made it harder to fight against what the camp was doing to him. Against his better judgement, Cameron walked up patted his roommate on the head to try to calm him down. He tossed Patrick a clean uniform and said, “Come on. Shake off those first-day jitters and let’s get to work. You’ll feel better when you’re out in the sun with the little critters, I promise.”<br />
<br />
Patrick wanted to fight back, to come up with an excuse to get out of his assignment so he could find an escape from this crazy camp, but he just couldn’t find the courage to. It was like he really had become some whimpering, cowardly little mouse and there was nothing he could do about it. He nodded and quickly got dressed in his little uniform before tagging along behind his tanuki roommate, praying to god that this day wasn&#39;t going to get any worse…</p>
