<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake&#39;s hands hovered above his laptop&#39;s keyboard. His eyes quickly scanned all his options for new choices. His fingers reached the screen to hover above an image of a typical human male member. Perfect! Jake hoped that, with this, his dick would at least return to its human shape, even if it wasn&#39;t exactly the same.<br />
With a nervous glance towards Aidan, he clicked &#39;yes&#39; to accept his new selection, and closed his eyes in anticipation. A warm glow seemed to wash over him, and when he could see clearly again, he tried to speak, but no words came out. His head was throbbing. What on Earth had just happened? He couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t do anything, except feel.<br />
When the world came back into focus again, everything was... different. His room felt weirdly empty and too large around him. Something didn&#39;t feel right, and it didn&#39;t look right, either. Everything was huge around him, the floorboards stretching away and the desk looking as though it was a whole building.<br />
But then he realized that the world around him hadn&#39;t grown at all, he had shrunk. No, the truth was much more bizarre than that. Jake wasn&#39;t even sure what he was, because he definitely wasn&#39;t human anymore. The long, dark shape that he had just grown into was no human body. And he was certain that, somehow, he had made a mistake in operating the program.<br />
The floor was still several meters below him, and the rest of the world towered even farther above. He couldn&#39;t move his head, but he strained his vision upward, and could just barely make out the face of Aiden looking down at him.<br />
Aidan&#39;s mouth dropped open, his expression frozen.<br />
&quot;Oh my god.&quot;<br />
Aidan looked like a giant to him now. His body was way too tall and massive. Jake tried to say something to get his roommate&#39;s attention, but again, nothing came out of his mouth. Not a single sound.<br />
&quot;Oh my god...&quot; Aidan said again.<br />
Jake wanted to get away, to get away from all of this, but he could hardly move. It felt as though his body was bound by invisible chains. He glanced at Aidan again, noticing his roommate&#39;s hands reaching out towards him. It seemed like he was just as shocked and confused as he was.<br />
&quot;Are you...&quot; Aidan started, but trailed off.<br />
Jake realized with growing concern that he still didn&#39;t have any control over his new body, no matter how much he willed it. He felt completely frozen in place. He couldn&#39;t speak or move - not even blink.<br />
Aidan&#39;s fingers gently brushed along Jake&#39;s back and it tickled, but he couldn&#39;t get away from it. Instead, he felt something else building up inside of him, a weird sense of longing he couldn&#39;t quite describe. A tingling feeling started inside him, growing more intense with each brush of Aidan&#39;s fingers, spreading over his whole body until he felt it right down to his core.<br />
&quot;Jake? Are you okay?&quot; Aidan&#39;s voice came out shaky.<br />
Jake couldn&#39;t even respond, which was frustrating as hell. He couldn&#39;t tell Aidan he was alright, couldn&#39;t say a single thing. But even so, there was something nice about being petted by Aidan&#39;s large fingers. Jake realized that this tingling feeling was not only arousal, but a form of arousal that he&#39;d never experienced before. He could feel a throb deep down inside him.<br />
It was as though all his nerves were firing in all the right ways, creating an entirely new experience that left Jake feeling giddy with excitement and a little lightheaded, like he might faint or something. It felt so good that he almost didn&#39;t mind the fact that he couldn&#39;t control his body at all anymore.<br />
And Aidan&#39;s fingers weren&#39;t helping. Every brush made Jake feel more sensitive, more alive than ever, his body reacting in ways he couldn&#39;t control, his new shape pulsing and throbbing with excitement.<br />
Then suddenly, a jolt ran through Jake&#39;s body. He started salivating intensely and it leaked out of his open mouth. But it didn&#39;t taste like normal spit, no, this saliva had a certain thickness to it. And a familiar scent that Jake quickly recognized as... pre-cum. <br />
The realization hit Jake like a slap in the face. The strange shape his new body was, the tingling sensations, the lack of control over his actions...<br />
He was Aidan&#39;s penis.<br />
He&#39;d just transformed himself into Aidan&#39;s penis.<br />
He wanted to scream, to try to stop it somehow, but nothing worked. Aidan&#39;s fingers were still stroking Jake&#39;s body, his skin throbbing and tingling and feeling way too alive. <br />
Aidan was just as shocked as Jake.<br />
&quot;Are you... really my dick?&quot; Aidan stuttered.<br />
He was just as confused by all of this, but seemed a bit excited now, as his hands stroked and touched Jake&#39;s penis skin.<br />
&quot;What do you feel like, bro? You feel... normal. Well, normal as in I wouldn&#39;t know it was you in there if you weren&#39;t just... I mean...&quot; Aidan was struggling with what he was saying, trying to put together his thoughts. &quot;This is so fucking weird.&quot;<br />
He still hadn&#39;t stopped touching Jake&#39;s skin, though, still running his fingers over his skin, leaving tingling, pleasurable sensations in their wake.<br />
Jake wasn&#39;t sure how long Aidan had been stroking him for, but suddenly he could feel Aidan&#39;s fingers tightening around his skin, the pressure and pleasure intensifying until he felt a warmth pooling inside his shaft, spreading throughout his entire being until he couldn&#39;t contain it anymore, and he began shooting load after load of semen from his mouth.<br />
Aidan looked up in amazement as white streaks of Jake&#39;s sperm shot out in an endless stream, coating the floor beneath their feet.<br />
Aidan&#39;s hand stopped touching him, and he watched the seemingly endless stream of cum gush from Jake&#39;s mouth for several more seconds before stopping. Jake could barely focus, and his entire body trembled as he tried to process everything.<br />
&quot;Sorry if that was awkward, man. But I get a feeling you understand.&quot; Jake heard, but he was too dazed to really understand the word. &quot;Anyway, I gotta try to figure out what that weird program did. If you&#39;re a dick, then maybe I can just pick a different shape.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now, if I remember right, it was...&quot; Aidan trailed off as his fingers reached for the laptop keyboard again. &quot;...there,&quot; he concluded as his hand pressed &#39;cancel&#39;.<br />
Nothing changed. Aidan cursed. Jake&#39;s mind began clearing up.<br />
&quot;Why is it not working? C&#39;mon...&quot; Aidan groaned. He tried clicking on a few other options, but they just resulted in him receiving a &#39;program error&#39; message.<br />
Jake, coming to, was happy to see that his roommate was already looking to change him back. But Aidan shook his head in frustration, then stopped. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure there has to be something I can do about this.&quot; Aidan tried to encourage him. &quot;Just hold on, man, I promise.&quot;<br />
Jake felt nervous and uncertain as he waited for his roommate to come up with another solution. What if it didn&#39;t work? What if it made things even worse? What if Jake couldn&#39;t ever go back to normal again?<br />
Aidan continued looking at the options for a few moments before suddenly his face lit up, and he looked at Jake with a hopeful expression.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got an idea.&quot;<br />
Jake waited anxiously while his friend typed some words into the computer, then pressed &#39;enter&#39;.</p>
