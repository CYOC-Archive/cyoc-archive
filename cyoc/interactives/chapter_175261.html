<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike closed his eyes as the wave passed over him and his family as he hugged them tight as tears flowed like water from his eyes and everyone else’s. He never knew what caused the hug to break, maybe it was everyone transforming and mass shifting around or maybe the “magic” or whatever it was. He was sent backwards stumbling over the step which separated the living room from the hallway and entrance hall. His tried to put a hand on the low wall which stood by the door. His hand slipped on the wood top and he fell onto his knees both hands slamming against the large glass mirror which hung on the wall by the door. Lucky the mirror didn’t break as he opened his eyes and saw his reflection looking back at him. However, his eyes, his eyes which where normally a greenish blue where now a deep brown almost black. His short beard fell away, the little pieces of hair disappearing into dust as he became smooth face. <br />
<br />
He pulled back from the mirror as he smashed against the low wall which had been wood and drywall and now was rough uncut stone, like from a castle wall. He was breathing rapidly and his eyes where as wide as dinner plates as he watched what was happening to him in the mirror. He seamed to shrink at least a couple of inches as his short brown hair which was balding turned thick jet-black curly hair. It fell over his eyes blocking his view for a moment before it stylized itself pulling back into a short ponytail. The hair was the last thing on his mind as he noticed his cloths where disappearing. He shot his hands over his dick as the last of his cloths disappeared.<br />
<br />
“My God.” He said, but his voice sounded strange, but he could not focus on that either as thick black fur began to cover his lower body. His joints snapped backwards forming animal like legs as he feared he was becoming a centaur like his sister but his legs while thinner seamed thicker than a horse’s legs. His feet turned into hooves as he felt a pitch on his ass like he was sitting on something. He reached down and felt a short fluffy tail. <br />
<br />
He looked up, to see his ears had become rounder and coming out of his head where a set of deer like antlers. <br />
<br />
“A fawn or is it a satyr?” Said Mike as his eyes widened, his voice it wasn’t his voice even if his lips where moving. It was not the thick Boston accent which caused a few people to look at him weird around here, instead it was smooth southern but not truth southern. He had heard that talk before when he was vacationing in New Orleans…he was speaking in a creole accent. But that was not the thing that was causing his eyes to widen, his voice was feminine.<br />
<br />
“No…No…God…no.” said Mike as his voice smoothed out and became much more feminine in nature, his lips filled out and thick full eyelashes appeared over his eyes. His neck length and thinned a bit as his slight beer gut disappeared even as two mounds of flesh pushed up. He moved one hand to cover his breasts and another to cover his fur covered dick which was shrinking by the second. His arms thinned out becoming much more graceful as his breast finished between a B and a C cup in size. <br />
<br />
“No…no….No.” he kept repeating as his entire upper body was now a bare chested female satyr. Then with what felt like a kick to his balls, his balls and dick shot inward and he became a she. <br />
<br />
“NO!!!” he cried in a female voice as another wave of changes washed over him, well her. A top appeared over his breasts, but it was nothing more than a couple pieces of thick black leather in a crossing pattern, his midriff was totally open. A belt appeared around her now thinner waste also leathers with a couple of pouches attached to it. A short dress seamed attached to her belt one side was longer going down to her knee while the other was maybe 8 inches down from the bottom of the belt. Around one of her arms, a twisted armband made out of wood of some kind began to form with a symbol of a tree on it on his other hand his wedding ring changes to solid polished stone as well. Beside him appearing out of the floor was a boa staff with multiple pieces of clothed cloth and covered in markings of some kind.<br />
<br />
By now he well she was out of words as she looked up, as she did, the transformation appeared down. He had gone from a slightly overweight man in his mid to late forties to a female satyr with thick black fur starting around the waste who looked to be at most 30 likely closer to 25. She was good looking he admitted with a strong core and a good but not over the top bust. Curly black hair and a pretty face, with dear like ears also covered in black fur and a set of short antlers coming out of her hair. Then almost as an after thought he noticed that his skin tone was shifting going from a pale white which burned in the sun without sunscreen, going darker and darker until it stopped at a rich chocolate brown color. He had not only became a Satyr and a women, he had become a satyr and a black women. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Mike in thick smooth creole accent as he touched his face and felt the new skin.<br />
<br />
“Mommy…Daddy.” Cried his/her youngest child as Mike turned and looked to see what had happened to his/her family and their home.</p>
