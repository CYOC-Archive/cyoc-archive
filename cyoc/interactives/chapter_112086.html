<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiff watched in disbelief at her friend as she went around parading her filth. Farting and burping and just being unpleasantly slobbish, it was like she was a completely different person! As she watched, she half-consciously grabbed one of the sodas given to her and drank it. When she realized what she&#39;s done, she looks down in panic at the can. &quot;Lardo&#39;s&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; She shouted, dropping the can immediately. But it was too late. Already, Tiff could feel the bubbling sensation inside her. She whimpered slightly as it slowly built up, bringing the attention of Katie. <br />
&quot;Hey princess, what&#39;re you worrying about?&quot; She said as she released another fart without a care. Tiff was trying desperately to hold the brewing storm back, but was slowly losing her grip. A quiet *pbbbbt* made its way out, followed by a slightly louder *ppppBBBbbbpt*. The flatus slowly escalated, raising the bar higher after each failed attempt to hold back. Kate looked on stupidly.<br />
&quot;Why are you holding back?&quot; She asked, walking up to her &#39;friend&#39;. <br />
&quot;Because this is embarrassing, and gross, and I don&#39;t like it *pBBBt*&quot; Kate looked on confused. Why would her friend think farting was gross or embarrassing? She decided she should help her out.<br />
&quot;Come on princess, just relax. Let it rip!&quot; She reached forward and grabbed her friend. Tiff tried to resist, but with Katie&#39;s new girth also came more muscle, and she didn&#39;t stand a chance against her new strength. Katie grabbed Tiff in front of her, holding her hands over her stomach like she was about to perform a Heimlich Maneuver. Tiff was struggling wildly, releasing little farts as she tried to wiggle free.  <br />
&quot;Let me go!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not until you let yourself go. Come on, just fart!&quot;<br />
Katie pushed her into her belly hard, forcing Tiff to release a massive butt blaster into Katie&#39;s belly, causing it to ripple. As the fart was released, Tiff began to expand, pounds of flab bulging and building on her figure. When it was over, Tiff looked down in panic.<br />
&quot;Oh god, oh god! Please, just stop! I don&#39;t want to do this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Too bad.&quot;<br />
Katie once again pushed, causing an even bigger explosion of flatulence to occur. Tiff felt as pudge pushed and shoved against her shirt and pants, ripping them at the seams. Tears started flowing down her face.<br />
&quot;I said I don&#39;t like this! Stop forcing me!&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot;<br />
Katie pushed once more, but this time was shoved violently into a wall behind her from the sheer force of the flatulence. Tiff continued to push the fart out, her body finally freeing itself from her clothing at it reached weights heavier than Katie. When the fart finally died down, Tiff looked down at her body with dread filled eyes. She didn&#39;t want this to happen. Why was she forced to? Why couldn&#39;t she decide what she wanted? <br />
&quot;Wow, that was one hell of a fart. Good job, princess!&quot; Katie responded as she removed herself from the wall, a large Katie shaped hole left in it.<br />
Something in Tiff snapped.<br />
&quot;You...YOU!!!!&quot;<br />
Katie didn&#39;t have much time to recover before she was heavily punted in the face.<br />
&quot;YOU DID THIS TO ME!!!&quot; Tiff shouted, her eyes full of fury. Katie looked up in terror and confusion. Why was she so mad? What did she do wrong?<br />
&quot;OH, DON&#39;T GIVE ME THAT SHIT!!! YOU &quot;FORCED&quot; ME TO DO THAT!!! YOU FORCED ME!!!&quot;<br />
Tiff sent a kick into Katie&#39;s right temple, knocking spit and a bit of blood out of her mouth.<br />
&quot;We just HAD to enter this place!&quot; Katie was picked up and slammed into a wall.<br />
&quot;You just HAD to drink that shit!&quot; Katie was kneed violently in the stomach, Tiff&#39;s new strength and weight stabbing through the fat like butter.<br />
&quot;You know what?!&quot; Tiff punched the other girl square in the jaw before slamming her over her head and onto the floor.<br />
&quot;YOU!&quot; Kick<br />
&quot;AREN&#39;T!&quot; Kick<br />
&quot;EVEN!&quot; Kick<br />
&quot;MY!&quot; Kick<br />
&quot;FRIEND ANYMORE!&quot; Punch<br />
&quot;You stupid...fucking...slob...*sob*...&quot; Reaching the end of her adrenaline, Tiff reached her emotional climax as she began sobbing over the bloodied, brutally beaten body of her broken best bud. <br />
&quot;I just wanted *sob* to have a good time *sob* with my friend *sob*, I didn&#39;t want any of this stuff to happen! *sob*&quot;<br />
 As Tiff sobbed, Katie slowly became conscious with a slight moan.<br />
&quot;T-Tiff?&quot; Tiff stopped sobbing, and gasped as she looked down at her ex-friend.<br />
&quot;Katie? Wait, no, you&#39;re not...&quot;<br />
&quot;No! *cough* *cough* *hack*, god, it&#39;s me! I&#39;m...me again.&quot; Katie&#39;s bruised body let out a deflated, almost sad sounding fart that echoed in the room. Now significantly more conscientious about her bodily functions, she blushed profusely before stuttering out a &quot;sorry.&quot;<br />
Tiff frowned. That HAD to be the real Kate! A new set of tears set in as she leaned down and grabbed the girl in a hug.<br />
&quot;Oh Katie, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;<br />
&quot;I-It&#39;s okay, Tiff! I&#39;m fin-*cough* *cough* *cough*, oh god...&quot; Katie stuttered back as her face grew redder, very aware that her fat naked body was being held up to her friend&#39;s fat naked body. <br />
&quot;Oh god, we got to get you patched up! I can&#39;t believe I would Do something like this to you!&quot; Tiff shouted as she stood and helped Katie stand up. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, really. I think you literally beat the slob out of me. Sorry I had been so...forceful with you.&quot; <br />
&quot;Whatever, water under the bridge. I just...*we* just...need to get the FUCK out of here while we&#39;re still us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, shouldn&#39;t we find a cure or something for...this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not risking it. Besides, there are far worse things to be in life than fat and gassy. Heck, we&#39;re BOTH now fat and gassy, so it should be fine if we stick together.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah...I guess. It&#39;ll be so embarrassing, though, when we get back to school.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;ll have your back. You fart, I&#39;ll fart louder, you got it?&quot;<br />
&quot;O-Okay, if you say so.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. Now let&#39;s get out of this hell hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, our two protagonists continue their lives, helping each other through life with their new problem riddled bodies. Thus concludes this stupid ass story on this stupid ass website where plot is meaningless and characters are only there to be used for kinky shit. So really, this outro has no meaning, and anyone reading it will give it no meaning. Cause, you&#39;re on this site to jack off, no? Why the fuck would it matter whether these characters have a happy ending? What if torturing them is your kink? By that standard, these are nothing more than names attached to bodies attached to whatever you want them to be attached to. Isn&#39;t that just fucking depressing. I&#39;m done here.</p>
