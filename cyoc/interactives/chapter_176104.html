<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a night of clubbing unlike anything Brandon had experienced before. Even in his youth he would prowl the night clubs for single young women, but this was something else entirely. The drinks flowed, they danced and grinded, all three on the floor. Sometimes they would find other partners for a dance or two but always wound up back together. Eventually he found himself in a nearby apartment with just the couple, drunk and worked up to a level of horniness he thought he would never come down from. When Cindy slipped him the little pill during a kiss he thought nothing of it.<br />
<br />
Then Carlton moved in, pulling Brandon towards the large bed that dominated the couples bedroom. Buttons popped as Carlton tore his shirt open, running hands over Brandon&#39;s muscular chest. The slightest touch sent shivers through him like nothing he had felt before, especially as Carlton leaned in and nibbled teasingly on his nipples.<br />
<br />
Cindy definitely liked to watch, she sat on a lounge chair with a view of the bed, a glass of wine in one hand and her fingers already exploring her pussy with the other. She nodded them on encouragingly.<br />
<br />
Brandon didn&#39;t need much more encouragement. He tore Carlton&#39;s shirt off, flexing muscles causing the fabric to rip right down the middle. Soon two pairs of pants were on the ground as well as the two men embraced, hands exploring muscled curves, tongues exploring each other&#39;s mouths.<br />
<br />
Brandon roughly shoved Carlton back onto the bed, grinning hungrily. &quot;You want my big cock?&quot; Brandon growled deeply, Carlton nodded and spread his legs, exposing his hole. He pressed one of his fingers against that ring until it popped inside of the other man, pulling a soft moan out of him. He slapped his cock against Carlton&#39;s thigh, leaving a smear of pre behind and drawing out a small whimper of excitement. &quot;Bet you&#39;ve never had one so big before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon thought his cock might even look bigger than it had before, definitely girthier. But he was too horny, drunk, and excited to give it much thought. He pushed the head of his cock against Carlton&#39;s hole, leaking pre slicking the passageway some as he pushed inside the smaller man.<br />
<br />
It was almost like a pussy, warm, but tighter than any woman he had been in before. Carlton was taking the cock like a champ though, relaxing as it was pushed into him, squeezing around it as he pulled out. He started to work up a rhythm. He didn&#39;t even slow as he felt a dainty hand on his shoulder. Cindy was there, now completely naked. She crawled onto the bed and straddled Carlton&#39;s face, giving him something to snack on while he was fucked at the other end. Soon Brandon had his first orgasm of the evening, flooding Carlton&#39;s hole with his hot seed. They tried a few more positions that night, and Brandon had two more orgasms. One inside of Cindy while he sucked off Carlton, which he hoped gave her a little Brandon to deal with, and another as they both sucked him off. His body was a machine, young, and full of energy.<br />
<br />
Even that wore off eventually and all three of them fell asleep in a tangle in the bed.<br />
<br />
Brandon woke up with the sun just starting to come through the windows of the apartment. The warmth next to him was unexpected but welcome. Carlton was sandwiched between him and Cindy, with his arm tossed over Brandon&#39;s chest.Carefully he pulled himself free of the bed, trying to find where the bathroom and some painkillers might be, His head was pounding like a drum.<br />
<br />
He took a likely door, and through squinted eyes checked the medicine cabinet. Bingo. He grabbed a few pills and swallowed them dry, though when he shut the medicine cabinet door he nearly spat them back out. He had changed again. His skin was slightly lighter than it had been yesterday, like a drop of cream added to coffee. The hair on his head was also a looser curl, enough that he could run his fingers through it, and his eyes were suddenly a bright blue. Even as his old self his eyes had been brown, but these were the same blue as.. Fuck.<br />
<br />
He looked back out to the sleeping Carlton. Those were the same blue eyes under those sleeping lids. Jannes had said something about changes from taking in DNA hadn&#39;t he? And he.. he had sucked Carlton off and got a big old dose of his DNA right down the throat. And just like that he looked like a young black man that had a white grandparent or some form of mixing. He was pleased to see his large muscles remained at least, not taking on Carlton&#39;s more leanly toned style.<br />
<br />
He needed to get out of there, he quickly grabbed his jeans and pulled them back on. They felt a little tight in the back. Maybe his physique wasn&#39;t complete unchanged he thought as he eyes Carlton&#39;s rather rounded bubble butt, quite prominent for a guy. The buttons on his shirt were a loss but he still pulled it on, even if it hung open it was something. He grabbed his shoes as he snuck out of the apartment, not stopping to put them on until he had ridden the elevator down to the lobby.<br />
<br />
It took him a moment to orient himself in the neighborhood, but eventually he managed to find his way back to his car. He started it up and pulled out to head home. He had only gone a few blocks when there was suddenly a flash of red and blue lights behind him. &quot;Fuck.. is one of my tail lights out?&quot; He pulled the car aside into one of the deserted parking lots. This whole are of town was bars and nightclubs, all shuttered and dark this early in the morning. The cop car pulled up to block him in.<br />
<br />
Just his luck. He rolled down his window as the cop came striding up, cocky walk mastered. Though this wasn&#39;t one of those fat, donut eating cops either. A quick glance told him that the officer probably matched him pound for pound the way that uniform strained across muscles as he leaned over to get a look in the car. The man was Hispanic, in his early thirties, his skin lightly tanned, dark hair shaved into a buzzcut even as he also sported a short trimmed black beard. &quot;Nice ride. License and registration?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask why you pulled me over?&quot; Brandon was trying to use his best business CEO voice, eyes flicking to the name tag &quot;Officer Fernandez?&quot;, but it just pulled an arched brow from the officer. Brandon sighed and pulled out his license and got his registration from the glove compartment. He didn&#39;t think anything of handing it over until he saw the officer taking the license out of his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot; The cop flashed the ID sporting Brandon&#39;s old face at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.. I must have.. grabbed my uncle&#39;s wallet.&quot; It was the best he could think of on short notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brandon Whyte, huh? The big wig? Step out of the car and put your hands on the hood.&quot; The cop stepped back, motioning for Brandon to do as told.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the entire weight of the situation came crashing down on him. He was in deep shit. He got out of the car and turned around, placing his hands where instructed. &quot;Please officer, this is just a misunderstanding.&quot; He was getting patted down and his wallet was pulled out of his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;All these cards for Brandon Whyte.&quot; He scoffed and threw the wallet in the car. &quot;You know what? I think you just saw a car with the keys still in it and took a chance. Stick it to the man. But you know what.. I&#39;m not completely unsympathetic. Turn around but keep your hands at your side.&quot; Brandon did as told only to see the cop slowly unbuttoning his shirt, exposing a heavily muscled torso with a swath of thick black hair across it. He undid his fly as well, opening his pants and pushing his jock strap aside to let his heavy cock flop out, sticking out hard and proud from a thick mass of curly dark pubes. Brandon may match him for muscle size, but this cop even had his monster beat. It was like some sort of veined monstrosity. &quot;Suck it, and I might let you off with a warning if you do good.&quot; Brandon must have made a face because the cop laughed. &quot;What? Too good to suck a little cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Even worse, the sight of the cop&#39;s hairy chest and cock was causing his own cock to stir in his pants. &quot;Suck it, or I bring you in for grand theft auto.. your choice.&quot; Brandon knelt down in front of the cop and took that huge cock into his hands. Was the serum still active, was this going to give him another dose of unwanted DNA? But as another stern command to, &quot;Suck it,&quot; came, Brandon opened his mouth and took as much of it into his mouth as he could. He remembered sucking off Carlton, if just a bit, and he tasted clean, salty, and a little earthy. Officer Fernandez tasted like musk and sweat.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t take the whole cock into his mouth, but tried to remember what Cindy and Carlton did with his own monster last night. &quot;See. I knew you&#39;d be good at this.&quot; Brandon felt a hand on the back of his head as the officer thrust his hips a little, face fucking Brandon as he knelt in front of him. This was new for him. He had always been the one in control, the one in power, but being dominated like this... well... it was turning him on. As he felt the cock start twitching in his mouth he tried to pull back but the cop held him in place with an iron like grip. &quot;Swallow.&quot;<br />
<br />
And he did. The cum gushed into his mouth and he swallowed every drop, even licking his lips as Officer Fernandez pulled his cock out of his mouth and started shoving it back in his pants. &quot;Nothing like a morning blow job to end a shift. Now get out of here.&quot; Brandon turned around to grab the door handle of the car and was yanked back and shoved away. &quot;Not with the car, shit head. This is getting towed and the owner called. I&#39;m just going to pretend I didn&#39;t see you. Now get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon eyed the car, his wallet that now sat on the car seat, then at the cop. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; And he turned and walked off, heading back to the street. He fumed as he walked a few blocks. He was going to kill Jannes for putting him in this mess. Once he was confident he was far enough away he pulled out his phone and opened a rideshare app. Luckily his payments were stored in there, too.<br />
<br />
It was five minutes before a car finally pulled up and he crawled into the back seat. Luckily the driver seemed to catch his mood and stayed quiet for the ride back to his apartment. He idly scratched at his chest as he watched the city blocks go by, though when he felt something strange he looked down, only to see a patch of dark hair starting to spread out from between his pectorals. Fucking serum. Fucking cop.<br />
<br />
He tried to pull his shirt closed, but with no buttons it was a futile effort. He practically scrambled out of the cab before it even came to a complete stop in front of his building. He knew he looked a mess, his shirt torn open, his jeans stained from kneeling in a parking lot, it was no wonder the doorman was getting up to block him as he was coming in the building. An unfamiliar person in a bad state, even Brandon couldn&#39;t blame him, this is what he was paid to do. But unlike the cop, Brandon was a beast compared to the doorman, and the baleful glare he leveled his way. &quot;Can I ask who you&#39;re..&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon just marched past him toward the inner door, where he punched in his security code. &quot;Guest.&quot; Is all he said and headed towards the elevator. The code seemed to be enough for the man as he went back to his desk still casting dubious looks Brandon&#39;s way.<br />
<br />
Still, Brandon couldn&#39;t relax until he reached his apartment. He tore off his shirt and threw it aside, going into the kitchen to pour himself a glass of scotch to wash the taste of Officer Fernandez out of his mouth. The stainless steal exterior of his fridge threw his reflection back at him. His skin had lightened slightly again. He was still pretty dark, but it put him somewhere in ethnically ambiguous territory along with his bright blue eyes. More stunning was the swath of soft, curly dark hair that now covered his chest and stomach. A quick check in his pants showed he was as hairy around his cock as Fernandez was too. He narrowed his eyes at his cock which also looked a little thicker. At least something good came of the encounter with the cop other than the need to shave down.<br />
<br />
Maybe not.. the hair did make him look.. no.. &quot;Stop fucking getting turned on by men!&quot; He shouted at his own reflection, draining his scotch and pitching the glass across the room to shatter. He needed this nightmare to be over..</p>
