<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re awake.&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyes opened suddenly. It wasn&#39;t a question or observation, the commanding voice made him conscious again. &quot;Keep your head down, boy.&quot; Jeff&#39;s body went rigid, holding his head firmly before a pair of heavy, leather boots. He couldn&#39;t defy the voice if he tried, it was like his inner monologue was the voice of an all powerful God.<br />
<br />
He could feel the heat from his thickly muscled father bedside him. The air quivering between the two giant redheaded Vikings.  Father and son, waiting with baited breath for direction from Jeff&#39;s other Dad (Elias&#39; husband and Master), Derek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slave--&quot; Derek grunted down at Elias, admiring his husband&#39;s massively muscled body covered in thick golden fur &quot;--what happened?&quot; Derek&#39;s voice was so deep, so powerful, it seemed to silence the ambient sounds from the room. All you could hear was Master Derek&#39;s commanding voice, reverberating deep inside you.<br />
<br />
Elias struggled to form words. Being the absolute attention and focus of his Master was always overwhelming. He steadied himself by bringing his big viking lips to Derek&#39;s boots and kissing them, blinking away tears as he gathered himself to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-my M-Master,&quot; the giant redhead was stammering, struggling to piece together words before Derek. &quot;Our son, Jeff, found his calling to serve.&quot; Elias returned to his hands and knees, whimpering in relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff,&quot; Derek&#39;s voice made Jeff flinch, his heart aching with a painful need to serve. &quot;Is this true?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s body was tingling, he felt more alive at his father&#39;s feet worshipping him like a God than any other time in his life. He belonged here, giving himself completely to his Dad... Perhaps one day earning a collar and being worthy of addressing his Dad as Master. <br />
&quot;... Although, you are so much more powerful than &#39;Master,&#39; father...I already think of you as my own personal GOD!&quot; Jeff realized he had been talking aloud the entire time, blurting out his deepest fantasy of serving and worshipping his father as a God. He buried his face against Derek&#39;s boot, whimpering in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, reminds me of when I first met your dad, Elias.&quot; Derek chuckled, &quot;you still think of me as your God, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my God--I mean, Master.&quot; Elias whimpered, painfully correcting himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that, slave?&quot; Derek asked knowingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I exist to serve you, my God!&quot; Elias was tearing up again, his cock pumping pre against Derek&#39;s boot, &quot;I can&#39;t live without you, I&#39;d die if I couldn&#39;t serve you!&quot; Elias was crying out his submissive entreats and Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel the submissive ache making him pine for his father in a similar way. A compersion... Like watching his dad submit made him feel more submissive. Was it contagious or genetic memory? <br />
<br />
All Jeff knew was that he needed to be just like his dad, a total slave who couldn&#39;t live without Master Derek. <br />
<br />
&quot;I NEED TO SERVE YOU, MY GOD! I NEED YOU! PLEASE USE ME, MY GOD!!&quot; Jeff broke into tears, begging and worshipping at Derek&#39;s feet. <br />
<br />
Derek looked at the two slaves before him. Physically, nearly identical. Both were 8&#39;6&quot; giant redheads, bloated with muscle, and with yardstick long cocks. His son, Jeff, was still growing though. At 16 he was already a giant, and too submissive to function at such a young age. His family tree seemed to compound these attributes with each generation. Derek believed that Jeff would soon surpass his dad in physique and submission. With the right training, he would be a trophy in his stable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, slave,&quot; Derek patted his thigh, &quot;sit up, both of you.&quot; Their heavily muscled bodies reluctantly removed themselves from Derek&#39;s boots and sat back at attention, heads firmly down. &quot;I order you to look at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their heads snapped up, locking eyes with Derek. Unlike earlier, when the glance at his father took Jeff by surprise—landing him in an orgasmic coma—the invitation to look upon his father seemed to soften the experience.  Time slowed, Jeff felt his vision tunneling as all he could focus on was his blindingly handsome father.<br />
<br />
This was the first time Jeff had truly seen his Father.  The chronivac hadn’t finished updating his memories, so he was emotionally unprepared for the sight.  Elias and Jeff whimpered together, unable to control their throbbing erections before Master Derek.  <br />
<br />
Derek was godly.  <br />
<br />
Generations of the most powerful and dominant men in existence had sculpted Derek to be a god amongst men. Everything about him radiated power and effortless control.  His voice was powerfully hypnotic, his words commanding in their eloquence. His intensely green eyes seemed to look deep into you, unlocking your inhibitions. <br />
<br />
As Jeff studied his dad’s features, he noticed the sharp European traits had been broadened and made more masculine by unmistakable Polynesian features.  A broad nose, square jaw, and neck that would make a bull jealous, with long black hair pulled back in a knot.  He looked like Maui the Demi-god on steroids, and even his beautiful tan skin was covered in ink that accentuated his size and dominance.<br />
<br />
“Slave, you are to help groom our son into his most submissive self with the intent of serving me.” Derek placed his hand on Elias’ chest to punctuate the command. “Understood?”<br />
<br />
“YES, MY GOD!  THANK YOU, MY GOD!” Elias was quivering, shaking...even after a lifetime of training, he struggled to maintain composure around his husband. He had long fantasized about serving Derek in a large stable of slaves, and now that was starting to happen with his own son! He was eager to push Jeff to be the best slave possible for their Master.<br />
<br />
“Son,” Derek removed his hand from Elias, causing his body to collapse at his feet, and brought it to Jeff’s chest, holding him firmly to deliver commands. “You are and have always been my slave.” The command knocked the wind from Jeff’s lungs.  Immediately, he felt his mind rearranging, correcting memories so as to stay in-line with the worldview presented by his God.<br />
<br />
“Your training begins today.” Derek continued, his eye contact unwavering as if breaking the connection would interrupt his careful programming.  “With the help of your alpha, slave Elias, you will push yourself to be the biggest, strongest, and most submissive slave possible.” The commands were cutting deep inside Jeff...the pain was so intense and yet his lips mouthed for more, desperate to be worthy of serving his God.<br />
<br />
“What will happen if you disappoint me and you are dismissed, slave?”<br />
<br />
Something clicked in Jeff’s mind. A realization that his reason for being was to serve his Father, his own personal God. He needed it as much as he needed air, food, or water.  And without it, he would die.<br />
<br />
“I would die, my God.” Jeff gulped, feeling tears run down his face. His father’s power over him was complete.</p>
