<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Patel was Randy&#39;s favorite teacher. He had just a touch of gray in his beard, and he stood at a whopping 7 feet tall. Randy was enthralled with Asian men. Although, all of society was enthralled with Asian and Middle Eastern men. Mr. Ajay Patel was just a beautiful example of manhood. Randy was only 5&#39;8&quot; and always felt the same thing most white Boys did. Asian men just made them feel so much smaller and shrimpier. And younger. Most Asian men talked down to other races in paternalistic tones, often with microaggressions regarding their more subservient nature. Randy had grown up in this world, so he was used to it. <br />
<br />
White men barely had any acting roles anymore. Blacks were almost invisible being so small and meek...it&#39;s not like they could play action stars and superheroes. <br />
<br />
Today&#39;s lesson was on why Europe had never been conquered. Randy watched dreamily as his Indian stud of a teacher filled out his dress shirt, towering above him. Sitting at his desk, Mr. Patel seemed that much more giant and fatherly. He especially above all other teachers made Randy feel like just a little boy. Randy was very thin and gay, and very funny. He was extroverted and considered the life of the party mostly anywhere he went. He was very popular with some of the Chinese jocks who had taken his virginity and plugged his hole throughout junior year. In fact, several of them recommended him. White Boys were very popular for that sort of thing, flirting with their much bigger Asian jock counterparts, carrying their books for them and make other housewife-like overtures to seduce one of the jocks into choosing them as their main Boy. <br />
<br />
Mr. Patel&#39;s muscles bulged. His stomach had gone to fat but he was an ex jock who still worked out as much as he could. His eyes glittered. His beard was rich and full with a tuft of gray coming in at the bottom. His bull neck was enormous and lifted his shirt off onto mounds that Randy couldn&#39;t stop staring at. His arms bulged, too, covered with sick tattoos that showed off his golden muscled dad bear bod. Randy wondered how big he was. He had to have at least a footlong. Most Indian guys did. Randy salivated. He wanted to be a Boyslut for his teacher so badly! <br />
<br />
&quot;And so, it is really because of the genius of Europeans in general that they were able to withstand the Muslim armies as long as they did. The fact was, they pulled together and didn&#39;t fight all the time like the often squabbling Chinese kingdoms. Europe was unified by a single Roman emperor for thousands of years. And the united European kingdom had so many inventions. Can you guys name some?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Chinese jocks looked bored. The white Boys were fascinated. The black boys looked shyly down at their books. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...the wheelbarrow?&quot; someone asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. The Europeans invented that, and a whole lot more.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The...compass?&quot; one Asian girl asked. She was already 6&quot;2&quot; and growing. Most Asian women got to be at least 6&#39;4&quot; on average. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent! Randy, how about you? Can you name me something Europeans invented?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...the condom?&quot; The class laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny, Randy. This is YOUR history, Boy! You should be proud of it. Now, what class do you math wizards take that you love so much? Algebra, right? Well, the Europeans invented algebra. It allowed them to aim big catapults at their Muslim invaders. Europe actually conquered the Middle East for several centuries. Which goes to prove that size isn&#39;t everything,&quot; Mr. Patel joked. &quot;As well as being scientifically ahead of the rest of the world for most of history up until China, Korea, Japan and India all divided Europe up into controlled zones after WWII. At that point, China became the most industrialized country in the world and Europe fell behind. But..we&#39;re talking Middle Ages here. What else did they make?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Paper?&quot; Randy guessed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. Very good! They had paper money the earliest. They developed roads, schools, banks, and traded with everyone rather than go to war. Now if most Native Americans had survived all the diseases that came over, they probably would have been more of the population. It&#39;s not like the Europeans wanted to take over the way they did. Most of them were horrified, right? They did everything they could to save their new trade partners. It&#39;s one of the reasons Europe pioneered medical techniques that later saved much of humanity from plagues. Now, for your homework tonight I want you to think of one accomplishment of whites that actually contributed to the world you live in today and how it impacts you...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Patel?&quot; Randy asked after the bell had rung and everyone had emptied the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Randy. How are you, Boy?&quot; Ajay put a friendly, warm hand on Randy&#39;s shoulder. Randy felt himself melt. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was just wondering if you would ever want to hang out...like...outside of school...with me? To um...tutor me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well...I can&#39;t really do that, Randy.&quot; Mr. Patel sat down in his chair so he could look at Randy closer to his face. Sitting up, Mr. Patel was so tall that he was almost as short as Randy was standing up! God, his voice is so deep, Randy thought. &quot;And something tells me you don&#39;t want me to just tutor you, do you Boy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, Sir. It&#39;s just so hard to stare at you every day. You&#39;re...you&#39;re my idol.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ajay tried to hide his pleasure over the statement. &quot;Well, that&#39;s very flattering. But...what happened between us that one night on the lake can&#39;t happen again until you&#39;re older. I should never have done it and I&#39;m sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be. I...I adore you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, you&#39;re a young white Boy, son. You&#39;ll find plenty of Asian men to fuck your brains out. Or even another white Boy.&quot; Randy grimaced. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want a real man,&quot; he pouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Mr. Patel sighed. &quot;Tell you what? I&#39;ll invite you over to do chores for me this summer. Mow my lawn. No, that&#39;s no good. White Boys can&#39;t possibly operate a regular mower. You&#39;re all too small. Hmmm. Well. Maybe you can clean my house. Or my pool. That&#39;s more believable. We&#39;ll start you working for me this summer, not too often so we avoid suspicion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, thank you so much!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I expect something in return. I have a few friends that would pay me for the benefit of fucking a much younger white Boy. And I could introduce you to some real Daddies. Most of them Indian, a few Arabs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds amazing, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a good white Boy, Randy. Now run along home. I&#39;ll let you know when I can set it all up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Randy was feeling very proud of himself, like he was on a huge high. Various Asian jocks noticed him in the hallway. &quot;Jarhead&quot; Sunhee Kim and Raheem were hanging out as he passed by their lockers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey get back here, white Boy! Hey, slut, I&#39;m talking to you. You haven&#39;t returned my phone calls, bitch!&quot; <br />
<br />
Randy didn&#39;t know what to do. Raheem was looking pretty mean as back up. Both Asian jocks were much, much bigger than him, both of them topping 7&#39;1&quot; this year. They were probably going to get even taller, too. Sunhee had been shaving his head for years and he looked just like a Marine. He was one of the most muscular boys in school, and he loved white Boy pussy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just...I&#39;ve been busy. My parents want me to focus on my studies. I&#39;m white, you now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that makes sense. White parents always make their kids study. It&#39;s not like you can compete for athletic scholarships,&quot; Sunhee told him. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I want some Randy pussy. I miss you, baby,&quot; Sunhee said, putting a finger delicately up to Randy&#39;s chin, looking far down at him. He held Randy&#39;s head gently and moved it forward so that he was rubbing his head against his torso and Randy felt his entire body rub against Sunhee&#39;s massive cock bulge, hidden not very well by his tight, giant jeans. Randy let out a little moan. &quot;No one turns me down, you little white pussy,&quot; Sunhee told him. Typical Korean jock football player attitude. Korean jocks think they can own you, Randy thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll ask my parents if I can have some time to go out with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If by go out with me you mean be the hottest piece of ass for me and Raheem here to plow. We&#39;re going camping down to the lake. You should come with us for a weekend. We can show you a real good time, Boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Randy stuttered a reply that he would try and make it. The real men swaggered away as he watched in exasperated jealousy. God, why couldn&#39;t he have been born a giant Asian jock like them?<br />
<br />
Outside, most of the kids had gone home. But a few boys were being chased around. Someone&#39;s younger brothers from the junior high across the street had made it over. The white boy was small and practically defenseless. He was only 4 feet tall. His Chinese and Indian classmates, all around the age of 13, were over 6 feet tall. They were shoving him around after they caught him, and going through his backpack. It was a common sight. Asian boys became men at such an earlier age. Asian boys will be boys was the saying. They had to get all that testosterone out somewhere. Still, schools had begun to become no tolerance zones to protect smaller minority students who couldn&#39;t defend themselves easily against their already adult sized counterparts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Leave him alone. What are you doing?&quot; As soon as he said it, Randy regretted it. The 13 year olds looked at him with furious anger. They needed to beat someone up today. Some little white fag they could easily take their aggression out on. <br />
<br />
Randy turned and ran. But he wasn&#39;t as fast as the superior gened Asian boys chasing him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What have we got here? Have we got a white faggot? Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you guys? You shouldn&#39;t be here,&quot; Randy tried to explain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up, BOY! Asians are always right. Say it!&quot; The Chinese boy, who was about 6&#39;2&quot;, pushed him down on the ground suddenly and quite easily. Randy had to catch his breath. &quot;Asians are always right. Please let me go, Sir.&quot; He sounded so pathetic he wanted to cry in shame. He noticed the little white boy had run off terrified. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only 12 years old, and you look way shorter than me. You&#39;re the BOY here. Aren&#39;t you?&quot; The Indian boy drew his fist back as if to strike Randy. Randy knew what he had to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t hit me. Sir. You&#39;re right. You&#39;re very big and I&#39;m the real Boy here. I am always going to be just a Boy. Please don&#39;t hurt me. I&#39;ll do whatever you want.&quot; Randy gulped. The 12 year old Indian boy already had a five o&#39;clock shadow, he noticed. More than he would ever have. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, he is just a Boy,&quot; a voice interrupted. It was Mr. Patel! He was a full foot taller at least than either of the junior high school boys, and he grabbed each one by the ear. &quot;What are your names! NOW!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sajesh Saed. OW. Sir, please don&#39;t.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What, don&#39;t hurt you like you were about to hurt this defenseless white Boy? Let me tell you little BOYS something. Non Asian Boys deserve respect and dignity. And I&#39;m of half the mind to call the police right now! You, what&#39;s your fucking name? Huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wu Chang, Sir. Ow ow ow!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you two motherfuckers ever come here again and harass any students, I will beat the living shit out of you! Do you understand me? Do you understand the law gives me that ability if I see you bullying small white Boys?&quot; He let their ears go and grabbed Sajesh, and held him against the wall. His muscles were bulging more than they had before. He was just so big and godlike, Randy thought. My hero. <br />
<br />
Mr. Patel started spanking the younger 12 year old hard on his 6&#39;2&quot; ass cheeks until the boy started crying. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s for raising your fist, and as for you,&quot; Ajay Patel turned around and smacked Chang the bully right in the face. &quot;I have every legal right to do that. I hope you enjoyed it. You&#39;ll get another if you do it again. I&#39;m going to report this to your school right away. Both of you get out of here.&quot; The two boys ran off while Mr. Patel motioned for Randy to wait for him. He got on his phone and left a message for the junior high. <br />
<br />
He was so glad he didn&#39;t have to go to junior high anymore. It had been hell as early as elementary school, when all the Asian 9 year olds were starting to really grow and all the white and black boys barely grew any. They all started to dominate the playground at that age. It was genetics and you couldn&#39;t stop it. Randy felt himself having to look up increasingly at the Chinese, Indian, Arab, Korean, and Japanese boys increasingly. White Boys tended to self segregate starting at that age. They were safer with their own kind. If they tried to play with the Asians, they were always too rough with the whites. Most of the Asian boys could shave and pass for white sized adults by age 11. Even some 8 and 9 year old Asian boys reached 6&#39; feet by that age. It just wasn&#39;t fair, Randy thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to give you a ride home and talk to your parents about what happened,&quot; Mr. Patel said, gently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to? It&#39;s so embarrassing. They were only 12. I thought they were 13.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like it makes a difference? Don&#39;t be embarrassed by your genetics. It&#39;s not your fault white Boys are smaller. In fact in time, you&#39;ll begin to see it as an asset. Just think of how many bigger Asian jocks are gonna want to fuck that cute redheaded ass of yours in college. You&#39;re going to be very popular, you know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Randy said, hopefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know it, little buddy. Come on.&quot; Mr. Patel lovingly patted the much shorter white Boy&#39;s head in a paternalistic fashion. It was quite common for taller Asian men to treat even grown adult white Boys in the same way, the way they would look out for a child...</p>
