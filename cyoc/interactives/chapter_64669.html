<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly and I quietly made our way home following the third debate. Tabby had offered us both a ride, but we politely turned it down. People were probably going to assume that Molly and I would vote for Tabby anyway, and we didn’t want to create the possibility for accusations of a fixed election. I didn’t think such a scenario was possible, but given all the occurrences of conspiracy and other things… the fact that the scenario was impossible did not mean that some nut with a “theory” couldn’t cook up story along those lines. And it would then take additional work to prove that everything had been on the level… or would make the next election even worse.<br />
<br />
As we walked, I tried to keep my mind on non-political matters. Mostly to insure that the walk home was peaceful for Molly and I. Not that we disagreed politically. Both of us didn’t want Hireman to win, but the subject of him and the election would surely aggravate Molly as well as me. So, I tried to keep the subject matter on topics more appropriate and light hearted.<br />
<br />
“So, are there any new kids in the Summer Sun program?” I asked Molly as we walked, “kids that were either in Pre-K or not in school yet last year… kids that could be in your class this fall?”<br />
<br />
“A few,” Molly answered, “though it’s mostly a mix and match of kids from various grades in the Summer Sun program… so I can’t spend all my time searching for “new” students and introducing myself to them.”<br />
<br />
“Do you know how many kids will be in your class next fall?” I wondered.<br />
<br />
“Student lists aren’t mailed out until closer to the end of the summer,” Molly answered, “so I don’t know for sure… though I am fairly excited. First full year as a teacher…”<br />
<br />
“Everything we set out to do,” I shrugged.<br />
<br />
Molly nodded with a soft smile, “and hopefully Tabby wins the election and things stay that way.”<br />
<br />
I nodded again and we continued on.<br />
<br />
“The kids there still treat you as a furry jungle gym?” I wondered after a moment.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Molly chuckled, “it’s been amazing how positive and friendly the kids here have been… Adults have had a mixed bag of results. Some like the Choirs have been good friends. Some have been absolute jerks like Hireman… but the kids have always loved me… and you to an extent.”<br />
<br />
“Me?” I wondered.<br />
<br />
“Some have seen you and Officer Barnes around town at times, and the others have asked me if I’d like to adopt them,” Molly almost laughed, “I generally have to tell them that their parents would miss them if I did that, and that my “husband” would need to approve of the arrangement besides… which then leads to questions on who my husband is… and they seem to like you when they realize you’re a tiger-person as well… and those that remember seeing you doing the DARE work found you to be fairly friendly.”<br />
<br />
“I think most of them simply have a love affair with our fur,” I commented.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Molly shrugged, “but their love is undying and unconditional. Anyone should like that.”<br />
<br />
And to that I nodded. The kids loved Molly, their “Tiger-Lady” as she’d been nicknamed the summer before. It was a triumph of innocence as it were, and hopefully, Hireman would never get the chance to rob the kids of that innocence.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The news following the debate came with a fairly present surprise. Based on the exit polls from the debate’s results, Tabby had left it with a small victory. It wasn’t much, but in a situation where Tabby’s best weapon was negated, any victory was good news. And I followed the paper’s coverage while Molly was cooking our breakfast the next morning.<br />
<br />
“So, how did they say he did?” Molly asked.<br />
<br />
“50.1% believe Tabby won the debate,” I answered, “49.9% think Hireman won.”<br />
<br />
“A narrow victory for Tabby then,” Molly replied, “though… with all the laws of averages, I’d think people would classify the debate as a tie by those numbers. Tabby’s number would round down to fifty percent and Hireman’s would raise to fifty percent.”<br />
<br />
“The article on the debate though would go against the “tie” theory though,” I told her, “they do criticize Tabby for giving off seemingly rushed answers and not taking a firm stand on any one method in regards to the school’s budget, which was Hireman’s charge… but they really criticize Hireman for essentially ignoring the possibility for an emergency or some bigger issue…”<br />
<br />
“Wait… they’re criticizing Tabby for having multiple ideas to save the school money and pay for all the upgrades that are needed…” Molly wondered, “but they’re also criticizing Hireman for essentially saying there isn’t  problem?”<br />
<br />
“Yep.”<br />
<br />
“You can’t have things both ways,” Molly grumbled.<br />
<br />
“I agree,” I nodded, “but remember this part of the country is notorious for that sort of thinking. They want the “government” or “the private sector” to do all sorts of things for them, but they don’t want to pay for it.”<br />
<br />
Molly gave a growling hiss in frustration.<br />
<br />
“I’d count it as a victory for Tabby though,” I replied, “ultimately they may not like the fact that solutions to the problems may involve them paying more money… but if they’re not going to approve of sticking your head in the sand, either…”<br />
<br />
“Take the victories they give you,” Molly nodded, “hopefully this helps Tabby in the long run in the election.”<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And so life went on. I continued my work with the Police and Molly continued hers with the Summer Sun Program. Things at the station remained relatively quiet over the next few days. There were only a few routine calls and other small things that Officer Barnes and I were called to. Though with the Fourth of July holiday coming up, I got the sense that something was coming.<br />
<br />
Part of it came down one morning after clocking in. Officer Barnes had met me as usual as I made my way in, but instead of heading out to begin our patrol, he lingered near the door to Officer Howard’s office. After a few moments, the station’s chief opened the door and motioned for us to come in.<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong, sir?” I asked, almost sounding nervous as we entered Officer Howard’s office.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t believe so,” Officer Howard answered, “we merely have some of the normal publicity stunts to handle.”<br />
<br />
“Normal publicity stunts?” I asked, thinking this was some sort of joke or prank.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, normal,” Officer Howard nodded, “you see he Fourth is coming up in a couple of days, and every year Kalispell has fairly good parade. And their parade managers invite people from the local area to participate. City officials, fire department members, local businesses, just about everybody really. And since Columbia Falls is not a big enough community to support our own parade, we get invited to Kalispell’s every year.”<br />
<br />
“Ah,” I nodded, remembering seeing my father in the parades that Peoria had on the Fourth of July.<br />
<br />
“Now, we don’t provide security for the parade, that duty falls to the Kalispell PD,” Officer Howard continued, “but they have generally invited other Police chiefs to be in the parade and toss candy… that sort of thing.”<br />
<br />
I nodded, expecting him to give us instructions on what we were to do while he was attending the parade.<br />
<br />
“This year, they’ve decided to do things a little differently,” Officer Howard continued, “at least with our Department.”<br />
<br />
“Different, sir?” I wondered.<br />
<br />
“They’ve followed as much of the news as anyone else has,” Officer Howard replied, “and they believe the novelty of having the state’s only tiger-person that is a law enforcement officer in the parade will be a good thing… so their parade “leader” asked for you and Officer Barnes this year.”<br />
<br />
That came as a complete surprise to me.<br />
<br />
“We would be honored, sir,” Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
“Don’t give me that,” Officer Howard grumbled, “you and I both know you’d rather be in the charity softball game against the fire department.”<br />
<br />
“It’s all for a good cause, sir,” Officer Barnes retorted.<br />
<br />
Officer Howard only shook his head while I ended up making a “hmm” like noise, wondering what this was.<br />
<br />
“Every year as part of the Fourth of July, our station plays the Columbia Falls Volunteer Fire Department in a friendly game of softball. All proceeds are donated to charity, and so forth,” Officer Howard explained, “and Officer Barnes here, the man who is a consummate professional whenever he is on duty… gets ultra competitive in these games. Took out their catcher once…”<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t believe how much they brag when they win, sir,” Officer Barnes answered, half jokingly.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure,” Officer Howard shook his head, “but you may have to simply put up with it this year, as you and Officer Wayne have a parade to attend this year.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, sir,” Officer Barnes replied in an accepting tone.<br />
<br />
Officer Howard then nodded and went on with his explanation of what we were expected to do for this parade.<br />
<br />
“Now, you won’t be driving the vehicle they’ll have you in, so don’t worry about knowing the route,” Officer Howard explained, “all you need to know is where they start.”<br />
<br />
He then motioned to a small city map he had on his desk. It was a Kalispell street map with what looked like a parking lot colored in yellow highlighter.<br />
<br />
“This is the assembly area that they gave me as where the car or the float you two will be on will start from,” Officer Howard answered, “Now, the parade starts at ten AM and their lineup starts at nine. You two might want to be there before then so you can find a place to park.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t we park there in the assembly area?” I wondered, “it IS a parking lot?”<br />
<br />
“They close off all traffic to that area that isn’t parade related,” Officer Howard answered, “it may be easier to drop your car off at their Police Station and then walk to the site… or ask them for a ride.”<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I nodded.<br />
<br />
“Very good,” Officer Howard replied, “and remember… you will be representing this station in the parade. Do us proud.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, sir,” was the answer we gave… not in unison, obviously.<br />
<br />
“Okay, that’s all that I have, really,” Officer Howard answered, “You can go about your work as normal… until the Fourth at least…”<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I nodded and then headed out.<br />
<br />
“You really took out their catcher in a charity game of softball?” I asked Officer Barnes once we were outside the station.<br />
<br />
“He was blocking the plate and didn’t have the ball,” Officer Barnes answered with an embarrassed shrug, “what was I supposed to do? Stand there and wait for the ball to arrive and be tagged out?”<br />
<br />
“Not if you wanted to win,” I commented.<br />
<br />
“Precisely!” Officer Barnes answered, “there is nothing wrong with a little friendly competition. I compete hard in those games to win them, and the Fire Department guys compete just as hard. The fact that the catcher was blocking the plate without the ball is proof of that. And as said…all the proceeds go to charity. It’s not like I’m pocketing money in these games.”<br />
<br />
“Just curious is all,” I answered.<br />
<br />
“You know what curiosity does to cats right?” Officer Barnes teased.<br />
<br />
“I now that satisfaction brings them back,” I retorted, earning a small chuckle.</p>
