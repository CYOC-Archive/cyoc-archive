<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ty watched, the transformation show got wilder and much hornier. Especially for Brian and Ian. Their goatees had grown in so noticably that the guys hadn't been aware of what was happening from their waists down. 
<br />
 First Ian's legs had started to taper down while his feet became very black and shiny. As if in response, Brian's legs matched Ian until both guys were sporting hairy haunches, black hoofs and tails. Ian looked down to Brian's legs and a leer formed on his face. His tongue sprang out of his mouth and started licking his lips. Then he rubbed his hands together and made a very loud bleating noise. It was a more masculine sound then any goat would have made, but it caught Brian's attention.
<br />
 In seconds Ian was down on his knees sucking Brian's now quickly growing cock. Brian reached down and started to fondle Ian's nipple. He stroked and pinched and rubbed it until Ian had developed a massive erection. Brian started drooling once he saw the long and thick member bolt free from it's foreskin covering and emerge pink-headed before him.
<br />
 Ty watched in glee as the final elements of Brian and Ian's change were set in motion.
<br />
 The lust had worked it's magic and horns sprouted upon the guy's heads. Brians were curved and white. While Ian's were shorter and sharper and stuck up from his head at a backward angle. They were a great compliment for his new chestnut satyr coloring. Brian played with one of Ian's horns as Ian vigorously sucked his meat.
<br />
 Then, the last part of the change fell into place, though neither of the new satyrs noticed it. That was because everything that had happened felt natural and normal to them. This change felt that way, too. 
<br />
 The beefy studs started to shrink in stature until each was no more than five feet tall. They didn't loose any of their firm, hard and large musculature, but now, compressed and compacted on their smaller frames, the muscle made them look almost god-like. They had, indeed, been blessed by Pan, each satyr thought, unaware that Ty was their transformer.
<br />
 Ian continued sucking until an outrageous bleat announced Brian's amazing orgasm. Ian grabbed the curly satyr hair on his friend's butt and held on tight as load after load of hot cum shot down his willing throat. When the last shot hit its mark, Ian started to rise up from the position he was kneeling in and bleated his approval loud and clear. Now, it was Brian's turn to repay Ian. 
<br />
 Meanwhile, Ty's attention had shifted to what was happening to Hank and Paulie.
<br />
 Both guys had been too busy with the beginnings of their own changes to pay much mind to Ian and Brian. Now, the two boys had coarse hair growing across their legs and each had sprung a glorious tail above their butt cracks. Ty hadn't expected that the coloring of the guys would be identical, but it was beginning to look so. As, was the fact that they were changing into very large manimals who looked like they could do commercials for a certain beer company.
<br />
 Just as with the satyrs, Hank and Paulie had developed legs that tapered down to hoofs. But there the similarity ended, for these guys were getting a new set of legs springing forth from a place just above their pelvic bones. Plus, rather than shrinking, the boys were expanding into massive-muscled men riding Clydesdale lower halves. Their coats were  a deep black-brown while the feathers around their enormous hoofs were white. Their asses expanded in unison and became hugh plow-horse butts. While, underneath their lengthened trunks, a sheath had formed around their swollen members and their cocks took on all the attributes of equine equipment.
<br />
 Ty couldn't get over how huge his friends had become and how they appeared to be a perfect set of matched twins. It was hard telling the two great studs apart. Ty's cock was standing up straight and ramrod hard. Precum pouring down from its swollen head to the leaves and twigs and dust below.
<br />
 Hank looked at Paulie and grunted in a deep masculine voice. He rubbed his hand against the dark beard that had spread across his face. Paulie looked at Hank and grunted his approval. He ran both of his hands first through the curly black hair on his head and then down into the hair that covered his chest. Hank saw Paulie's huge horse dick jump to attention and didn' need to be told what to do.
<br />
 Ty could barely contain himself and looking back and forth between the horny satyrs and the bucking, fucking centaur broncos he was having a very difficult time choosing which way to go and which couple to join.</p>
