<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cat girl? What the heck was that? That something to do with Anne-May or something didn&#39;t it? Or was it those game-videos? I was gonna dress up as someone&#39;s pet? I was gonna work in a cat cafe? Whatever it was, I was about to find out! <br />
<br />
Then the screen became a pixelated spiral of colors, while a soft pulsing beat range through my bones. The logical thing to do was simply close my eyes. And I&#39;m sure lots of people here had the same idea.. except I did. When I tried to close my eyes, the pulsing made me feel like I should look at the screen. And what harm was there anyway? Was this some cheap hypnosis trick? That stuff was all suggestion or cohorts planted in the audience. That hypnosis stuff couldn&#39;t actually make you do anything. So what harm was there in looking? <br />
<br />
Just staring at the beautiful spiral. So lovely. So perfect. They should have just made a business of selling time to look at the spiral, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d have made more than whatever this was... how could anyone want to do anything but look at the spiral? Listen to the sweet loving pulses. <br />
<br />
I had the world&#39;s biggest goofiest smile on my face and I couldn&#39;t have cared less. I might have wet myself I so let go of all my cares. And I still didn&#39;t give a frick. Why should I? The spiral was so beautiful, it was everything. I was willing to just dive into the spiral, deeper, and deeper, and yet deeper. <br />
<br />
And I began to hear words in the pulses... no, not words. Truths. <br />
Object. Doll. Toy. Not-human. Happy. Love. Diligence. Serve. Obey. Perfect. Doll. Object. Toy. Not-human. Happy. Love. Diligence. Serve. Obey. Perfect. <br />
<br />
My head swam. And just let go of more and more heavy weights, and just floated more and more, more free of the annoying burdens of thinking, of deciding, why should I bother with that crude when I could just be instead?<br />
<br />
I happily took a rusted steak knife to my own ego, burned the corpse, buried the ashes in the backyard, then built a house over it. It was so much better than to be free of such things. <br />
<br />
I am an object. A doll. A toy. I&#39;m not human. I&#39;m happy. Love. I&#39;m diligent. I serve and obey. I am perfect. I am a doll. <br />
<br />
I was rolled along with the others, and tilted up slightly, and comfy rubber arms lifted me up, and gently placed me in a mold, and sealed it shut. The spiral screen was built into that too. It would never leave me.<br />
<br />
And as I dove deeper and deeper, I understood... the spiral didn&#39;t just fill me, it was me, I was the spiral. Whoever and whatever I&#39;d been before was just junk that I didn&#39;t need to bother thinking about. The mold began to fill with pink rubber... my flesh and bones dissolved in it, but I didn&#39;t feel a thing... my brain dissolved, but my consciousness remained in the web of rubber within the molded mass... my collar remained... <br />
<br />
I floated in the perfection of it all... until I felt myself harden, and the mold tilted till it was vertical,  and opened up. I still out of my mold with a sweet little &#39;pop!&#39; In front of all of us was a mirror to let us see our new selves. <br />
<br />
I was a bright pink mass of living rubber, shaped like a humanoid kitty. Rubbery ears, tail, muzzle, paws, claws. With a white patch on my belly, inside my ears, under muzzle, and tip of my tail to break it up. My hips and chest were several times bigger than they&#39;d been before, I was pretty sure if I was still human I&#39;d have fallen over or broken in two. But I wasn&#39;t. I was something better than that. I was an object, I was a toy, property. I was something to be owned and used. And in anyway my owner saw fit. <br />
<br />
My eyes were blue, but were much bigger than they had a right to be, and looked to be painted on even as I blinked and closed one eye, and tested out the other. I even poked myself in the eye and didn&#39;t feel a thing, but since when does rubber feel pain? Heh! <br />
<br />
Soft lights shined in a pattern above moving forward, and I marched ahead with my new brothers and sisters. My new blue brother smiled next to me. He had much the same color pattern as me except blue instead of pink. He was a cat boy, and was as exaggerated as me, no way that thing between his legs could ever fit in any sort of shorts. The way it waddled back and forth as he walked was actually rather silly looking! Heh! <br />
<br />
A door in the mirror opened up, and we each stepped through. Inside was a maid uniform... sort of... it was pretty much just an incompletely rubber skirt and rubber dress... with my rear, front, and chest wide and exposed. I put it on without hesitation, I had to look as desirable as possible. If I wanted to be something more family friendly, I should have with the child door instead, that was just common sense. There was also the bell I attached to my collar. <br />
<br />
I checked myself in another mirror. I was perfect. <br />
---<br />
&quot;Big sister, do we really need to use such forceful methods on our new brothers and sisters?&quot; A naked blue wolf woman made out of rubber said sitting at the control console of the conversion line. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you questioning your purpose or something?&quot; Asked the bright orange rubber lizard man next to her. <br />
<br />
The blue wolf was scandalized. &quot;Of course not! What do I look like? Human? I just think we make things way too scary for the Adult line of toys. The Child line of toys made to be care takers, playmates, and protectors have a much more peaceful time being converted into our family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting in a large chair behind the pair, a large green rubber dragon woman as naked as the rest spoke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;They want to be objects of pleasure for humans, so they&#39;ll be treated with the same respect as them, they&#39;ve already signed away their rights to personhood, we&#39;re just now changing them into what they already are legally.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of them wore the same collars as the humans on the conversion line. Though the dragon&#39;s collar read 000000B. Her brother&#39;s, formerly her husband, was  collar was 000000A, and was the scientist half to her magic half of the magic/technology pair who had perfected the dollification process. He was the prototype of the child-friendly doll line, same as she was the prototype of the adult-friendly doll line. Their end goal was simple, love and pamper humanity into world peace. <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
I stopped out of the &#39;dressing room&#39;, not that I felt anything resembling modesty, shame, or humiliation, those were useless emotions for me that I was happy to be rid of. I still felt thing like joy, pleasure, fear, love, but anything not related to my purpose was tossed in the trash where it belonged. And what was my purpose?<br />
Whatever my owner decided it was! Like, DUH! <br />
<br />
There were animal women of every possible thing, including next to me a half-fox woman half mermaid who had the body strength a python as she scooted across the floor under her own power, her humanoid half upright. <br />
I spotted my blue cat boy brother next to me too. <br />
<br />
Since we&#39;re just dolls, we&#39;re both technically an &#39;it&#39; but humans have always externally assigned traits to objects they don&#39;t have. Why should we be any different? <br />
<br />
His outfit was the same as mine. Exposing all the places that on a human being would be considered scandalous. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m not human, so it&#39;s no big deal. <br />
<br />
Scientifically speaking, I&#39;m not really a living thing, so it&#39;s not like this is cruel somehow. <br />
<br />
Heck, since I don&#39;t have that free will garbage weighing me down, I&#39;m not really sapient. Oh sentient means I experience the world, totally separate thing. <br />
<br />
We each marched into a storage box with our picture, ID, and description it, and sealed ourselves into total darkness and silence. <br />
<br />
Bored? Don&#39;t make me laugh! Why would an object be capable of feeling such a useless emotion? I&#39;m not suffering in agony like those 9-5 wage slaves. <br />
<br />
I could be dropped at the bottom of the ocean, forgotten for a million years, then get right back to work! <br />
<br />
What I didn&#39;t expect was for my brother to be with me when my storage box was opened up by my owner. That was a special detail about us. We couldn&#39;t be owned by a company, a household, or a corporation or a government, we had to be owned by living breathing people. It was hardwired into us. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a co-ed bar club, you two better be worth the loan I took out to buy you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Master, we will fulfill your every desires.&quot; My brother and I echoed proudly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It would be too annoying to just call you &#39;you there&#39; or something... hmm.&quot; Our owner thought over what to call us. I&#39;d be annoyed at him not even reading the owner&#39;s manual, but we were pretty self explanatory in our uses and it wasn&#39;t like we needed any maintenance, we&#39;d happy serve humans until the sun burned out.</p>
