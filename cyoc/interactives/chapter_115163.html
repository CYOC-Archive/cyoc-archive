<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harold Jenkins got his car keys and wallet while Melissa gathered up her things.<br />
Then, he happily drove his daughter to Moon Lake High School as Melissa continued to talk.<br />
&quot;At first my dreams were just showing me possible options in regards to my future here, especially before you became a weretiger and I was facing a deadline choice on becoming the family were,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;Well, at least you don&#39;t have to worry about that now,&quot; said her father, before letting out a small roar.<br />
Melissa had a bemused look on her face as Harold smiled. <i>It&#39;s been so long since Dad&#39;s smiled, I was beginning to fear he forgot how.</i> &quot;Anyway,&quot; continued his daughter, &quot;besides talking more about my future now that the deadline pressure&#39;s off, my dream self has some serious concerns about Virginia too.&quot;<br />
&quot;So do I,&quot; agreed Harold.<br />
&quot;She worries that if Virginia is at least charged, let alone faces trial for violating Moon Lake&#39;s Statute 1A, then your John Sebastian Jenkins will never be born,&quot; revealed Melissa.<br />
Harold Jenkins released a low, menacing growl as his daughter hastily added, &quot;But she also told me that Decrux was trying to reach out to scratch you, Virginia was trying to stop her, but instead Decrux moved Virginia&#39;s paw to scratch you at the last moment as some kind of spur of the moment decision.&quot;<br />
&quot;Interesting, but how would we be able to ever prove that, let alone why?&quot; wondered her dad.<br />
&quot;My dream agrees with you about the first part. After all, how can a dream testify in court? But the why is because Decrux is hoping Virginia somehow winds up out of the picture and she can eventually come in to <i>win</i> you,&quot; revealed Melissa, making air quotes around the word win.<br />
&quot;Over my dead body,&quot; promised Harold, &quot;besides, how can a wereraccoon and a weretiger mate?&quot;<br />
&quot;Males and females, duh,&quot; replied his daughter, before explaining what her dream said of were genetics versus potential offspring.<br />
&quot;The more I hear about Decrux, the less I like her,&quot; said Harold.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed his daughter, as he pulled into Moon Lake High School&#39;s student drop off section. &quot;But if it&#39;s any consolation, my dream self also said that no matter how long it takes, you wait for Virginia, although the longer it is, the less chance your predicted son will arrive.&quot;<br />
&quot;DAMN!&quot; said Harold, making that the first time she could remember her father cussing since her mother&#39;s death.<br />
Then Melissa noticed all her friends, including Trevor Tyson, were waiting for her as she got out of the car. &quot;I&#39;m not sure yet, but since it&#39;s Thursday, I&#39;ll probably be coming straight home after school today.&quot;<br />
Then father and daughter said goodbye before Harold headed home.<br />
<br />
As Harold pulled into the driveway of his house, he saw a strange car pull into the McCoy driveway next door. He watched and his heart leaped for joy as Virginia got out of the front passenger&#39;s seat as Harold&#39;s new, more acute weretiger hearing heard the driver say, &quot;Okay Miss McCoy. Just remember what I advised you to do and I&#39;ll phone when there&#39;s a court date on the existing charges.&quot;<br />
Virginia simply said &quot;Okay&quot;, before the car backed out of her driveway and left.<br />
&quot;Virginia?&quot; said Harold hopefully, as he started to walk across his front yard toward her.<br />
&quot;Harold, as wonderful as it is to see you, I&#39;ve been advised to stay away from you until the police finish their investigation and the DA decides whether or not to level charges against me for violating Statute 1A*.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Harold in disbelief, stopping in mid-step.<br />
&quot;Yes. The only good news out of all of this is that Decrux has been told to keep away from both you and Melissa too while the police are investigating this matter,&quot; added Virginia.<br />
&quot;Well, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that you&#39;re here,&quot; began Harold, pointing to the fact that her house was next door to his, &quot;I&#39;d already be looking for a realtor to get away from her. But is everything all right?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Virginia, doing her best to keep from crying. &quot;That was my Teachers Union appointed legal representative who just dropped me off after spending the night in jail. Besides what I&#39;ve already told you, I&#39;ve been suspended without pay for the rest of this week for changing in the daylight without cause and being in that fight to begin with. The only reason I&#39;m not facing a longer suspension is because Decrux started the altercation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, that doesn&#39;t sound too bad. After all, today is Thursday,&quot; said Harold, trying to sound reassuring.<br />
&quot;But starting Monday, I&#39;m on administrative leave until the DA makes a decision on the Statute 1A* issue.&quot;<br />
&quot;Meaning?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to work in the School District Administration Building everyday for less than full pay until I&#39;m either cleared or officially charged. My teaching future is in the DA&#39;s hands now, but all I&#39;ve ever wanted to do with my life is teach. I don&#39;t know anything else,&quot; said Virginia, finding it more difficult now to fight the tears.<br />
&quot;I want to help, but I don&#39;t know how,&quot; began Harold. &quot;I was beginning to have feelings for you even before the accident. Besides, I need to know more about being a weretiger. Before yesterday, I was even having these unusual dreams—&quot;<br />
&quot;Dreams?&quot; wondered Virginia. &quot;What dreams?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. About me. You. Us. A son we&#39;re supposed to have some day named John Sebastian Jenkins.&quot;<br />
&quot;John Sebastian?&quot; Virginia asked in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Yes. And like I said, those dreams were <i>before</i> the accident. I don&#39;t have any feelings for Decrux. I never have and I never will,&quot; swore Harold.<br />
&quot;Oh Harold...&quot; began Virginia, no longer able to hold back her tears.<br />
Harold started to go to her. Every instinct, human and weretiger, said it was the right thing to do.<br />
But as Harold took his first step, Virginia cried, &quot;Not now! It isn&#39;t fair! You have to stay away till this is all over!&quot;<br />
With that tearful plea, Virginia McCoy turned and tearfully ran to the front door of her house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Jenkins. STOP!&quot; he heard a voice yell, halting his pursuit as Harold was about to step foot onto McCoy&#39;s property.<br />
Not knowing who dared to keep him from his woman, Harold turned to see two men standing behind him. The fact that they both were displaying police badges was the only thing that kept him from growling at the intruders. <i>How long have they been there?</i> he wondered, knowing that he was totally distracted talking to Virginia.<br />
&quot;Detectives Miles and Lukasky,&quot; said Denny Miles, as the officers put their IDs away. &quot;You should listen to the lady. This is a serious situation as it is.&quot;<br />
&quot;I, that is...&quot; began Harold, turning his head back and forth to look between them, Virginia&#39;s front door, and them again.<br />
&quot;I understand, but it&#39;s important that you do what Miss McCoy advised you to do and stay away until the DA makes a decision on this,&quot; advised Lukasky.<br />
&quot;And if you truly want to help her, you can let us inside your house so we can sit down and have a long discussion about everything that led up to yesterday afternoon,&quot; suggested Miles.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; agreed Harold, as he led the way to his own front porch.<br />
<br />
And across the street, although it was too far away for her to actually hear anything, wereraccoon Alice Decrux closed her bedroom curtain, smiling at all the trouble she had already caused her rival and what (hopefully) laid in store for Virginia McCoy before she went back to bed.<br />
