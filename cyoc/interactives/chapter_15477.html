<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff clicked on &quot;Glam Rocker.&quot;  A sub-menu promptly popped up, from which he selected, &quot;New Romantic.&quot;  From the next sub-menu that came up, Jeff chose, &quot;Duran Duran (early)&quot;.  When the program asked which member of Duran Duran he wanted to look like, he selected, &quot;Nick Rhodes.&quot;  From the &quot;Flavor&quot; menu, Jeff chose &quot;Extreme.&quot;  From a sub-menu asking for &quot;Body Type,&quot; Jeff decided on, &quot;Muscular.&quot;  When yet another sub-menu asked for &quot;Degree of Muscularity,&quot; he chose, &quot;Extreme Freakin' HUGE!&quot;   When another sub-menu asked for his choice of &quot;Intelligence Level,&quot; he thought, &quot;Who says all muscle-men have to be dumb?&quot;  He therefore selected, &quot;Extreme Super-Genius.&quot;<br />
<br />
For his last manual selection, headed, &quot;Income Level,&quot;  with a wicked grin, Jeff chose, &quot;Extreme Super-Rich.&quot;  Then, tiring of making so many choices, he moved his mouse to the lower right-hand corner of the screen and clicked on an icon labelled, &quot;Auto-Complete.&quot;  The program thereupon picked up where Jeff had left off, automatically making all the remaining selections based on the choices Jeff had already made.<br />
<br />
Moments later, the program displayed a complete list of the choices which Jeff and the Chronivac program had selected.  At the top of the screen, a message in bright red letters read, &quot;PLEASE REVIEW ALL SELECTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING!&quot;  Below the list were three buttons, marked, &quot;Proceed,&quot; &quot;Modify,&quot; and &quot;Cancel.&quot;  Jeff obediently read down the list, but found nothing he wanted to change.  So, taking a deep breath, he clicked on &quot;Proceed.&quot;  A new screen promptly appeared, with a message reading, &quot;Changes Beginning!&quot;  The light on the Chronivac's emitter unit glowed eerily for a moment, then suddenly Jeff stiffened as he was struck directly by one of numerous bolts of energy which issued from the emitter.<br />
<br />
The lightning-like display continued for nearly five minutes, then a &quot;BING!&quot; came over the system's speakers, and the monitor displayed a message reading, &quot;CHANGES COMPLETED!&quot;  Jeff shook his head, then looked around.  He was genuinely shocked to find that the comfortable suburban home he had been living in was now what could only be described as a &quot;mega-mansion.&quot;  His own bedroom was now at least ten times larger, with furnishings that fairly dripped and oozed and radiated the most extreme wealth and luxury imaginable.<br />
<br />
As he looked back at his desk, he realized that even his computer had been upgraded to the hottest gaming and multi-media system that money could buy.  He checked the monitor, which was now a 96-inch plasma wall display, and read over his revised vital statistics.  Jeff was now 7 feet, seven inches tall, and weighed over 800 pounds.  His mouth dropped open as he read his new muscle measurements.  He tilted his head down, and found that his chest was now so massive that he could not see the floor.  His pectoral muscles alone were bigger than even the most gigantic watermelons he had ever heard of.  As he swaggered over to a three-panel, full-length mirror, Jeff actually felt his IQ increasing to a level even he had not thought possible.<br />
<br />
Jeff simply could not stop grinning as he gazed at his reflections.  Even the clothes he wore were beyond anything he had dared to expect. He was wearing a poet shirt of heavy, brocaded white silk satin, which was tucked into a pair of equally heavy, brocaded black silk satin pants with legs wider than any rave pants he had ever seen.  His ultra-muscular waist was cinched by a four-inch-wide belt of heavily-studded black patent leather, with an oval-shaped, cowboy-style buckle so huge it almost completely covered his abdomen.  On the buckle was the name &quot;JEFF,&quot; spelled out in solid turquoise letters, each of which was surrounded by small diamonds.<br />
<br />
As Jeff looked at his new outfit more closely, he saw that the shirt was lavished with layer after layer after layer of ruffles and frills and lace, while the sleeves were at least twice as big around as his already gigantic upper arms.  Even his shirt collar had a band of ruffles and lace that came all the way up to his chin.  Around his tree-trunk-sized neck there was a wide, black scarf, made of the same silk satin brocade as his pants, and which was neatly tied into a gigantic bow.  The bow, in turn, was further embellished by a huge brooch of mirror-backed crystal, cut in the shape of what jewelers referred to as a &quot;brilliant cut&quot; diamond.  The wide cuffs at the end of each sleeve had multiple layers of ruffles and lace extending all the way out to Jeff's fingertips.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked into the lower half of the mirrors and found that his pant legs each terminated in an enormous 6-inch-wide cuff.  His legs and feet were encased in knee-high, lace-up boots of the heaviest, richest black patent leather money could buy, with 9-inch stacked heels and 6-inch platform soles.  He looked around for a moment, then spotted a suit jacket on a hanger which, in turn, was hanging from the door of the biggest walk-in closet Jeff had ever seen.<br />
<br />
The jacket, made of the same heavy black silk satin brocade as his pants, was of waist-length cut, with a low-cut, four-button, double-breasted closure.  Despite the size of both Jeff's arms and his shirt sleeves, the jacket slipped on easily.  Jeff buttoned the jacket, then took another look at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
This time, it was his face and hairstyle which captured Jeff's attention.  His formerly run-of-the-mill dirty blonde spikes had become a huge mane of rich chestnut waves which ended in a curl that just brushed his incredibly massive shoulders.  In the front, his hair came down to just barely above the top edge of his thick, bushy eyebrows.  The remainder of his super-luxuriant tresses had been teased up to at least 6 inches in height, and could easily have been made twice as massive had Jeff wanted it so.  His face was heavily made up, with jewel-toned eye shadow and lipstick, while his nails were lacquered in a different but complementary jewel shade.  His eyes, formerly a nondescript brown, had become a brilliant emerald green, while his lips were huge, full, sensual and kissable to an almost obscene extreme.  His perfectly-shaped ear lobes were almost obscured by huge diamond studs which sparkled from their centers.  The effect was completed by a heavy application of Coty's &quot;Preferred Stock&quot; cologne, whose effects had been amplified considerably by the addition of pheromones.  The total effect of these cosmetics was to raise and augment an already shockingly-handsome face to a level of glam-rock sex appeal that was almost unbearably powerful.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his massive young head and chuckled in utter wonder, then walked over to an enormous bureau.  On the marble top of this bureau was a huge jewel box, from which Jeff selected a number of heavily jewelled rings, which he distributed among the fingers of both hands.  He was careful, however, not to place a ring on the fourth finger of his left hand.  After all, he reminded himself, even though he was now worth over 20 billion dollars, he wasn't married--at least, not yet!<br />
<br />
At that moment, his butler appeared to inform him that his most luxurious limousine was ready to take him to the Duran Duran concert which was scheduled for that night.  &quot;Are my friends all ready to go?&quot; Jeff inquired.  The butler assured him that they were all as richly dressed and made up as he was, and that they were waiting for him in the limousine.  &quot;KEWL!&quot;  Jeff gushed--he WAS still a teenager, after all, even if he was a multi-billionaire.  His entire being tingled with excitement and anticipation as he swaggered out to join his friends for a night on the town that none of them would ever forget.</p>
