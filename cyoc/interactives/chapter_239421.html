<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next few weeks, Rachel&#39;s interest in the Chronivac waxed and waned. At first, she checked the timer religiously, believing if she didn&#39;t, something bad might happen. But as she grew accustomed to being female, her attention shifted to other matters, and she started to pay less and less attention, opening the programme only when a problem arose and she was convinced it was time to become Patrick again.<br />
<br />
But always at the last minute, she talked herself out, usually with telling herself something along the lines of, &quot;You need to give this a fair chance. Other girls don&#39;t have the option you do just because something in their life doesn&#39;t happen the way they expect it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Satisfied with this each time, she saved and logged off her profile, convinced she&#39;d made the right choice. Yet, another problem would arise, and she&#39;d soon be right back to opening the Chronivac, ready to make the change, and talking herself out of doing so after a bit. After the eighth time of doing so, this time after starting her period, and forced to deal with only memories telling her she&#39;d had to learn how to use pads and tampons since a little after her thirteenth birthday, Rachel reclined back in the desk chair. Drawing her feet up to place them on the seat, then wrapping her arms around her legs, she stared at the laptop screen.<br />
<br />
Part of her knew she&#39;d likely save and close the programme again, whilst another tried to sort out how she was feeling, and if this was the point where she stopped being Rachel and went back to being Patrick. Unsure if she even wanted to become Patrick again, she wished Tanya was here to help her work out her thoughts. The other girl not coming over until later, Rachel decided this was an issue she&#39;d have to deal with. Reaching out, she ran a finger over the trackpad and clicked on a few things.<br />
<br />
Not making any changes, she instead scrolled and searched her profile for anything to give her an answer. Finding instead an option to cancel the timer and make the last change permanent, she ignored it as her thoughts circled back to how, when she&#39;d been Patrick and given herself breasts, it&#39;d felt as if something was off. Trying to recall exactly if this was accurate, and what might have been wrong, she huffed in agitation after some time. Unfolding herself, she stood and stepped before the full-body mirror next to her dresser. Using a foot to push aside the bean-bag chair, she gazed at the girl wearing a t-shirt which was a size too big and had a cartoon zebra printed on it, and a pair of black leggings with stirrups, thought about the tampon she&#39;d put in moments ago, how, before bed, she switch to a pad, and hugging herself, seeing the way the shirt pulled tight enough to reveal the two mounds of flesh cupped in a padded shelf bra, she wondered if the issue she might be having was she&#39;d never grown up a girl.<br />
<br />
Her memories insisted she had done so, but those were memories she knew which had been created by her manipulation of a computer programme she knew almost nothing about. Thinking about this, Rachel couldn&#39;t help but wonder if she was in some way a fraud, nothing but a person trying to pass themselves as something other than what they actually were. Frowning, wondering what exactly she was, beyond a confused teenage boy who&#39;d given himself breasts, then altered himself, and finally set a timer to become a girl for a select period of time, Rachel discovered she didn&#39;t know. Turning away from the mirror, she stepped over to her bed, lay down and hugged one of her body-pillows close. Letting her thoughts wander, certain in the long run she&#39;d close down the Chronivac, she felt even more unsure of herself. After some time, she sat up, pushed away the pillow, stood and ignoring the laptop, which had gone into sleep mode, she exited her bedroom. Heading downstairs, her aunt and uncle both still at work, whilst her cousin was out with his friends, Rachel headed for the kitchen, where she proceeded to call Tanya to find out if the other girl wanted to come over a little earlier than planned.<br />
<br />
Sometime later, the two friends met and headed toward the back of the house and Tanya&#39;s room. Tanya’s mother changing her mind and refusing to let her go over to Rachel&#39;s, it was agreed instead, begrudgingly, Rachel could come over, but wouldn’t be allowed to spend the night. Unhappy with this, but figuring it&#39;d be the best she&#39;d get, Tanya led the way into her bedroom, where, after Rachel had set her laptop on Tanya&#39;s vanity, Tanya inquired, &quot;So what&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel, not sure where to begin, took a deep breath as she sat down on Tanya&#39;s bed. Hands folded up in her lap, she gathered her thoughts as her friend puttered around the room, attending to various small things whilst she waited for her girlfriend. After a bit, Rachel blurted out, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I want remain a teenage girl,&quot; and before Tanya could reply, she added, &quot;But I don&#39;t know if I want to go back to being Patrick,&quot; and feeling all muddled up, she stood and started to pace back and forth, telling the other girl what was on her mind and the way she kept opening the Chronivac programme.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s almost as if I am searching for an answer, but I&#39;m looking in the wrong place,&quot; she finished, then, shrugging, she added, &quot;Or the answer is there, but I am missing something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unlike her girlfriend, Tanya was happy being female. She didn&#39;t mind all she had to rely on were memories, nor some of the issues which had arisen, some she had given barely any thought to before using the Chronivac. Taking everything in stride as best as she could, she hadn&#39;t even batted an eye when she&#39;d started to bleed, and had instead followed what her memories insisted she do as she recalled how, almost three years prior, she&#39;d bled for the first time and her mom had explained it was normal, then added the nonsense it was the curse of all women for the sin Eve had committed. This last part Tanya hadn&#39;t believed, but not wanting to contradict her mother, she chose to ignore it. Looking at Rachel as her mind went back over the last few weeks, then jumped sporadically as she recalled different points in her life, Tanya soon asked, &quot;So what can I do to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shrug, Rachel flopped down next to where Tanya sat on the bed. Curling up with her head in her girlfriend&#39;s lap, Rachel whispered, &quot;I honestly don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even know what I expected to happen by coming over her and telling you all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
At a loss on what to say, Tanya reached down and placed a reassuring hand on her friend&#39;s arm. Thinking, staring at the laptop, she soon mused aloud, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose, seeing as you don&#39;t want to become Patrick again, not remain a teenage girl, it&#39;d solve anything if you were to make yourself younger. Try growing up as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was something Rachel had considered, but had forgotten to mention to Tanya. Mulling over what the other had said, she soon asked, &quot;But wouldn&#39;t it create the same problem? And if it didn&#39;t, how young should I make myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Tanya whispered as a way to answer both questions as Rachel sat up.<br />
<br />
Lost in thought, Rachel consider her options, then began to think of how, wn the way over to her friend&#39;s house, she had toyed with the idea of maybe going back to being a child. Wondering if growing up a girl would be any different than making herself go from being a teenage boy to a teenage girl, she couldn&#39;t decide and thought, in the end, it&#39;d probably only lead to the same issues she was having at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or worse ones,&quot; she&#39;d thought before speculating on what seeing her mom and dad again would be like, if she were to make herself young enough were both were still around.<br />
<br />
Unsure, she&#39;d pushed the notion from her mind, and believed it wasn&#39;t something she ought to consider. But now, as she listened to Tanya weigh in on the matter, she sat up, went and collected her laptop and returned to the bed as she considered this might be a solution. Opening the laptop, she logged on, clicked on the programme icon and waited for it to display the two saved profiles. Thinking over, Rachel glanced at Tanya and thought aloud, &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll turn myself into a little girl, but also give myself the ability to become an animal, after learning to do so, at will?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of the things she expected to hear, this wasn&#39;t one of them. Scooting closer, Tanya inquired, &quot;Why would you give yourself such an option.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shrug, Rachel replied, &quot;Don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just playing with ideas,&quot; before lapsing into silence for a minute or so before repeating, &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; then adding, &quot;I just feel, if I have this, programme, this, ability, to change things, aspects, of myself, maybe I should give myself something unique, something along those lines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll always be unique to me,&quot; Tanya purred.<br />
<br />
Supressing a giggle, Rachel wanted to tell her to stop it, but instead settled for giving the other girl a kiss and saying, &quot;Same.&quot;<br />
<br />
After she&#39;d returned the sign of affection, Tanya commented, &quot;You know what, if you&#39;re going to make yourself younger, I think I&#39;ll probably do the same as well. This time, we&#39;ll both grow up together as girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
The matter seeming to be settled, Rachel turned her attention to the laptop, but didn&#39;t do anything. Looking at her profile, thinking, wondering what sort of animal she ought to have the ability to become, her thoughts went back to when she and Tanya had both become beasts. Recalling how her girlfriend had made herself a dog and Rachel a fox, she almost clicked on this option, but at the last minute, selected her species as canine. Choosing Dalmatian, she set this as her base species, then began to redesign her profile. Making it so she spent the first two years of her life as a dog, it was the work of the two humans who&#39;d become her parents who made her a human girl of one year. Entering she had no memories of this, though she did somethings dream of being a puppy, she included how, upon hitting puberty, she&#39;d start to morph back into a canine, and would need the help of her aunt to learn how to control the transformation, which would take her about two and half years to master.<br />
<br />
Happy with this, Rachel then proceeded to doctor her profile even further. Dropping her age to seven, she placed her weight at forty-seven pounds and her height at three foot eight inches. Making herself a tomboy, as she recalled growing up one, she set her main interests as computers, video games, skateboarding, and reading. Finishing, she scrolled through her profile, shifting and altering things as needed, unaware she was setting up the reason why her dad vanished when she was about eight or so, then her mom had disappeared around the time she was nine, leaving her to be raised by her aunt and uncle.<br />
<br />
When she was done, the last thing she did was to cancel the timer, make her current changes permanent, her new ones also permanent, then set the awareness to only her and Tanya, with the discomfort as low as possible. Turning to Tanya, she stated, &quot;Finished,&quot; before passing the laptop to her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
After she&#39;d read what Rachel inputted, Tanya thought about what she ought to change. Wanting to be the same age as Rachel, and grow up with her, she decided to do the same as her friend. Setting her base species also as a Dalmatian bitch, though from a different litter, she adjusted her profile so she was also was part of the same experiment which made Rachel human, would have the same ability as her friend, was given over to a couple who were looking to adopt, then, after making sure everything was as good as it&#39;d get, proceeded to make it so she was a girl of seven. Dropping her weight to forty-eight pounds and her height to three foot nine inches, she made herself a tomboy, though not as much as Rachel was, set her interest as reading, dolls, dress-up, and video games. Drafting more and more of her new life, the last thing she did was to set the new changes as permanent, made sure they&#39;d override the current profile, setting the new one as the default, and the discomfort as low as it could get. Going over her profile again, making sure she was satisfied, and only she and her girlfriend would be aware of the changes she passed the laptop back to Rachel, who shifted the windows so both profiles were pulled up and visible.<br />
<br />
Each girl giving the other a nod, Rachel took a deep breath. Confident this would be the last change for her, she clicked the accept option on both profiles. The transformation taking effect immediately, both were amazed by this as they were suddenly overcome with the worst case of randiness they&#39;d ever felt. Her period stopping, and the tampon she had in vanishing, Rachel failed to notice this as she felt her nipples grow hard, a buzzy, tingly sensation swept through her groin and genitals, and certain parts of her body grew more sensitive to touch. Shifting closer Tanya, she gave herself over to her girlfriend as she felt her breasts cupped and the soft, sensuous lips of the other start to caress her. Moans of pleasure escaping both, it didn&#39;t take them long before they&#39;d removed each other&#39;s clothes and using fingers, hands, and mouths, they set to work trying to satisfy each other until they ended up with Rachel lying atop Tanya, her vulva in the other girl&#39;s face as she applied her tongue and lips to stimulate Tanya&#39;s clitoris.<br />
<br />
So lost in their throes of passion, both were oblivious to the changes. As they diddled and sucked, their bodies began to shrink. Fur sprouting in sporadic patches as their breasts shrank and four extra nipples formed, it wasn&#39;t long before the two girls resembled two Dalmatian puppies and their attention to each other shifted as their minds regressed. Sexual activities becoming hyper-active play, their minds regressed, limbs realigned until all that remained of the two teenagers were two, pure-breed, Dalmatian bitches, body, mind and soul. But the change didn&#39;t stop there for them. As Tanya&#39;s bedroom reformed to fit the girl she made herself and reality continued to shift, the puppies began to morph until sitting on the bed were two surprised girls of seven years. Looking at each other, the last vestiges of the change fading, Rachel grabbed her leggings, shirt, socks and underwear as Tanya snatched up her jeans, shirt, panties and socks. Redressing, feeling confused, unsure of what had happened, Rachel and Tanya sat for a bit in silence as their minds reconfigured to what they now were, memories faded and formed, and after a bit, the two looked at each other, then at the laptop.<br />
<br />
Neither saying anything, both at a loss as to what to say, their minds telling them Rachel had come over to show Tanya the laptop she&#39;d just finished building with her dad and some of the things on it. As if on autopilot, Rachel saved and shut down the Chronivac programme. The instant she did this, what she and the other girl had just done, as well as what happened to them, slipped their minds. The last bits of reality altering, the Chronivac become nothing but a piece of software already installed on a hard drive Rachel&#39;s dad had bought second-hand. Neither Tanya or Rachel interested in the icon, the fooled about with the laptop for a moment longer before heading outside to play, Patrick, now Rachel, as content as Tanya with what she had become.</p>
