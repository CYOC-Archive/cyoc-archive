<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff hopped down from his chair and paced around his room, consciously trying not to stare at his computer or to think about how strange it felt to pace around on such little legs. Every minute or so he would check the screen to see if the hourglass had stopped, and every time he looked he cursed quietly in frustration. Boredom and impatience hung as a thick fog around him. After 10 minutes had passed, he hopped up on his bed (he was doing a lot of hopping now, he noticed) and laid his back flat on it with his limbs spread out fully. He groaned. Then, he sighed and tried not to think about how big the bed felt now. He waited. Time passed. He hoped it was a lot of time. It felt like hours. When he could not wait any longer, he lifted his head and looked at the computer. The hourglass was still spinning, mocking him. The clock was even crueler. Had it really been only 15 minutes?<br />
<br />
&quot;Argh!&quot; he groaned. &quot;That&#39;s it! Enough! I&#39;ve had it!&quot;<br />
<br />
He slid off the bed and dropped to the floor, bounded to the chair, and leaped upon it, spinning to face the computer and the malfunctioning machine. He sneered at the technology that had betrayed him, as he pressed Ctrl + Alt + Del to shut off the Chronivac warning message. He started the Chronivac program up again on his computer ignoring the red light flashing on the Chronivac itself.<br />
<br />
He pulled up his stats and his sister&#39;s stats and looked through the settings. &quot;That should do it,&quot; he said when he found an Undo command for both of their changes. He executed the Undo command just as he heard at knock at his door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffy? You okay in there?&quot; It was Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should be okay in a second,&quot; he said as he felt a tingle hit him again. &quot;Come on in.&quot; Jeff spun his chair to see Jamie enter his room, looking as mismatched as before with her girl head and adult body. This was perfect, he thought. He wanted to watch her shrink back to normal as he grew. As the tingling progressed, he noticed that something was off. Jamie was not getting smaller. On the contrary, she was growing. Her already curvy body was getting curvier as she put on weight and her hips and thighs spread out broadly. Her already enormous breasts swelled even larger and seemed to sag a bit. The overall impression made her body look even more mature and matronly, like a middle-aged mother. &quot;Oh, no,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at himself, as he had feared, he was not getting bigger. He held up his hands to see his little fingers getting stubbier and pudgier. They looked like the hands of a preschooler. The tingling ceased, and Jeff looked down at his body in shock. He looked so small. So young! He couldn&#39;t have been more than a few years old now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Jeffy?&quot; his sister asked as he flailed around to grab his desk and spin the heavy chair to face his computer again. He looked at the program and found a message that said, &quot;Change complete. Both targets affected by Redo command.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Jeff said. &quot;I meant Undo. Undo! Not Redo!&quot; He groaned in total fury. All he had manged to do was make his situation twice as bad as it had been. His body was only 4 years old now and Jamie&#39;s was 40.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffy?&quot; Jamie said as she stood next to him. &quot;You&#39;re worrying me.&quot; He looked up at her new form. What a comical appearance. She was a sweet innocent girl from the neck up, and from the neck down, a total MILF. He sighed as he realized that he probably looked just as comical with a teenager&#39;s head on a preschooler&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... fine,&quot; he said to her when he realized how authentically worried she was. &quot;I&#39;m just having computer problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie nodded. &quot;Well,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you alone. If you get too upset, come downstairs for a break. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he replied, and then he cringed a bit as she bent down to hug him, crushing his little body with her enormous middle-aged boobs as she wrapped her huge arms around him. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he grunted as she squeezed him in her warm embrace. She let him go, smiled, and walked out of his room. He watched her go, marveling at how she had become both mother and daughter all rolled into one now.<br />
<br />
Alone again, he sighed. &quot;What a mess.&quot; He turned his chair and carefully slid off of it. The drop felt so far now as his little feet hit the floor. He stood up as tall as he could, which wasn&#39;t tall at all. He felt so tiny now. And he had thought being 8 had made him feel small. His computer desk was shoulder-high to him now and he realized that he would literally need to climb up onto his bed at this height if he wanted to get on it. He took a few steps and felt frustratingly slow and weak. He put his little palms to his eyes and rubbed them in frustration.<br />
<br />
He was stuck.<br />
<br />
He was totally stuck now in the body of some freakish, teenaged kid. The machine was busted, and it would not fix itself now. He certainly couldn&#39;t fix it. He needed help.<br />
<br />
Just then, her heard a sound from downstairs.</p>
