<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And liquid flesh started to pour out of her body like a faucet. It started from her taut stomach, where it began to swell, and then it bursted, revealing more flesh within as it poured like an upturned bucket. The flesh covered her lower body. She wanted the process to be faster and made flesh pour out of every orifice of her body. Soon her nostrils, eyes, ears and mouth had liquid flesh pouring out, and she didn&#39;t stop until the amount of flesh was waist high. She gathered all the flesh and was ready for her fun. She shaped the liquid flesh into wardrobes, and placed them in her room, dozens of them aligned on the walls, so that she could store body parts that she thought were very special and wanted to keep. She then returned to the living room, and stood on the wooden floor, since she used up all her flesh on creating wardrobes. She melted down into a puddle, and zipped around the room. It was extraordinary, and she was able to even stick to walls if she made small little hooks on the side she is sliding on. Jennifer squeezed under cracks and doorways which felt amazing. She then formed her original body, with everything. She thought, &quot;Maybe i should try shapeshifting now...&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked up to the mirror, and looked at it. She pictured herself with jet black hair, and it happened. She gasped, she could already barely know who she was. She continued to change herself, by changing her skin tone to a darker one, her irises into a chocolate brown and make her breasts into a DD cup. She looked back into the mirror. She was a different person! She now confirmed that she could shape shift entirely! She shifted back to herself, and felt much more comfortable in her original body. She knew that she could shape shift now, and pondered on what to do. She thought that when she shaped her form into a pseudo-grasshopper before, it felt really nice. So Jennifer decided to perhaps mimic insects with just human body parts, since Jennifer had an interest in weird stuff, and being pseudo-instects could be interesting. Jennifer stood in front of her mirror, and plucked her arms off her elbow. She then grew another pair of arms and stuck her original arms just on the middle of her torso, and then sat on the floor. She twisted her legs around, her knees facing the floor. She then fell on all six of her limbs and lifted herself from the ground. She check with her knowledge of grasshoppers and felt that something was missing. She realized that her lower torso needed to be longer, and she stretched it out mentally and it elongated to her knees. She looked at the mirror again. She tried to walk, but it was rather difficult since her legs didn&#39;t have a grip onto the ground, and she slipped easily. She the lengthened her upper leg until her leg bended inwards. She felt a lot more power in her legs, and pushed, which made her jump a very large distance, and bumped her head on the door. Obviously Jennifer felt that she needed more room, and decided to leave the house to try out her new body, and maybe perhaps change into more forms! She poked her head out of the door, saw no one, and walked out of the door, the cold ceramic doorstep meeting the soles of her hands and legs. She saw that she still had her bra on, and tried to take it off, but struggled to do so. She then realized that it was her own skin, but simply had the pattern and color of her bra. She shaped her breasts back, and her tits came back to the world. &quot;Wow, I could even fake clothing!&quot; She shut the door, and bounced towards the woods with her grasshopper body. <br />
<br />
Jennifer remembered that there was a cabin in the woods, and she decided to go there, since it was rather spacious last she recalled. She tried to find it, and found it a while later. It was near the lake, which meant that Jennifer could also try marine life forms! Jennifer had many forms stored in her head, and can&#39;t wait to try them out. She went into the cabin, and hopped to the middle of the room. She was a bit fed up with this grasshopper form, and felt a bit tired, so she twisted her legs back to their normal configuration, and plucked her extra arms off and laid them on the side. Jennifer then decided to do something more large, a bit more change to her body. Jennifer concentrated on her legs, and tried to lengthen them out. They stretched towards the end of the room, and Jennifer maneuvered them so it made a U-turn and came towards her, she did this for at least a dozen of times, until she was satisfied with the length. She then pushed her legs together as hard as she could, until there was only a seam between her legs. She then smoothed her legs out, until she had only one large flesh-coloured snake tail. She pushed herself up, and tried to move, but failed and fell onto the floor. She tried to move her gigantic tail sideways, until she got the hang of it, and was moving across the room with fluidity and speed she never had before, and with practice, it felt like second nature. Jennifer felt that this cabin should be a place where she could store more of her body parts, and that she could experiment with different forms whenever she wants. She poured a bit more flesh, and made several wardrobes in the rooms of the cabin. She went back to the main room of the cabin, and coiled her flesh-coloured snake tail up, and slept for a while. <br />
<br />
Jennifer woke up, and saw that it was already nighttime. It was impossible for her to navigate back home, since it was rather dark. Thank goodness there was a functioning light in the cabin. She switched it on, and continued playing with her forms. She wondered where her vagina was, since she is a girl, although she could be a boy at any time, she wanted to be recognized as a girl. She searched for a while on she she thought was her crouch, until she found a seam, where when she opened it, had a gigantic pussy in it, she could stuff her whole arm in it, and maybe even a whole person! The thought of stuffing someone inside of her made Jennifer horny, and she rubbed her boobs, stimulating her even more, and to further top it off, she tried out her new vagina, and plunged her arm in it, and exploded in an orgasm! She lied on the floor, panting for more air. She didn&#39;t know that her cavernous pussy was now so sensitive! Her cum pooled around her crouch area, and it dripped down her tail and onto the floor. Jennifer snapped back to her senses, and pushed herself up with her tail, and slithered out of the cabin, since the ceiling wasn&#39;t tall enough for her whole body. She bent under the doorframe, and went out. <br />
<br />
The chilling wind of the night blew across her sensitive nipples and aroused her even more, but she controlled herself. She slithered across the grass, and found out that her whole tail wasn&#39;t even out of the cabin yet. It felt really nice to be so close with nature, her skin of her tail touching the soil and the grass, and her naked body in the wind. She felt free, able to do anything she wants. And she wan&#39;t wrong, she can do anything she realized! Her body had the capabilities to do anything, its just what to be. She slithered towards the lake, and went into the water. She dunked her head into the water, and surprisingly, the water was crystal clear. She swam with her tail, curving in the water, and she would do on land. She submerged in the water, the cool liquid caressing her everywhere. She never had been in the water naked, so this was a new experience for her. She went back up to the surface, and took deep breaths. She thought, &quot;This is rather inconvenient. Can&#39;t I grow gills?&quot; She tried to form gills on her neck, and succeeded thanks to her deep knowledge in biology. &quot;Thank god I listened in class&quot; Jennifer thought as she went back into the water. She took a breath in the water, and felt her new gills function, sucking oxygen in from the water. She explored more of the lake, until she felt something bite against her tail. She looked back, and saw a crocodile biting her tail. She thrashed in horror, but the crocodile held on tight. Jennifer was worried for a second, but stupidly forgot that she had powers! And this would be a perfect time to test out her form and her power! She figured that she can&#39;t let go of the crocodile, so she detached it, surprising the croc. She then regrew it, but had a spike at its end. She swamp towards the croc, grew fins on her back whilst doing so, and thrusted her tail at the croc. It hit its leg, and the croc clamped its mouth in anger, taking another bite of Jennifer&#39;s tail. She detached herself from the croc, and discovered and she lost at least three quarters of her tail. She figured that it would take a bit for her to grow the same length back, and decided to take another form. She willed the parts the croc chomped off to move back towards her, and she absorbed them back. She then lengthened her torso by a bit, and a seam grew along the bottom to her hips as the torso ended at a tip. She willed to seam to break apart, and it revealed razor sharp teeth. She absorbed her own head, and grew eyes along the gaping maw. She grew a pair of hand She stared at the croc, and she rushed towards the croc. The croc gapped its maw, but Jennifer made her&#39;s stretch wider, so that she chomped the head of the croc off. She chewed on the croc, and swallowed it. She then stared in horror, she just killed an animal! But then, the taste of it felt really good, the warm blood, the juicy tender meat. It was succulent! Jennifer wanted to try that again, she wanted the taste of flesh again! She swam to the top of the lake, and climbed on her four limbs back to the cabin.<br />
<br />
She met the door, and realized that her arm, or leg, wasn&#39;t long enough to reach it. She wanted to just stretch her limb to get to the door, but she wanted to be creative. She concentrated on her back, and felt a slight tingle, and then the flesh on her back stretched, and a thin tentacle whipped out, latched on the knob, twisted and opened the door. The tentacle zipped back into her back, and Jennifer went into the cabin. She grinned mentally, &quot;This could come in handy if I were to kill something&quot; She latched out another tentacle from her back, and closed the door. But she kept the tentacle, and ballooned it out, shaped eyes, a nose, ears and a mouth, and finally her hair. She reach for her head and plucked it off the tentacle, and stuck it on the end of her current body. The tentacle retreated back into her back, and she erased her eyes on her maw. She looked at the mirror, and it was as if she had a gigantic mouth for her pussy. She thought, &quot;Rape protection&quot; with a giggle. She shrunk her maw, and is receded into her crouch, and reformed into her vagina. The fin on her back melted into her back, and her limbs snapped back into their normal configuration. &quot;There, good as new!&quot; Jennifer said. She then pondered what to do next, she had the whole night to herself.</p>
