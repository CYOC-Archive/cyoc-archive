<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa was fairly quick to come down the stairs after her father announced that he was ready to go and that it was getting close to the time they were supposed meet with the Tysons for dinner. It was something that she was happily looking forward to, as while things between her and Trevor were still in the early stages of any real &quot;romantic&quot; relationship, things did seem to just feel right around him. As she made her way down the stairs, she figured that that went all the way back to when she first bumped into him in the hallway at school. He had his confident side, but was a perfect gentleman, something she didn&#39;t really get in Michigan. There had been some boys there that were interested, but a part of her figured they were far more hormonal than Moon Lake&#39;s weres were, if that was possible. In contrast to them, Trevor was always in control of himself and never let things get out of control, and it was a lot of that confirmed to her the nobleness in Trevor Tyson and lead to her having no regrets at becoming a werecow and Trevor&#39;s werecow. It might be a few years before any wedding bells rang, but a part of her was happily looking forward to that in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything ready?&quot; Harold said to her as she came down the stairs, &quot;all the new stuff put away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dad,&quot; Melissa gave a nod with a small chuckle at Harold&#39;s pretend &quot;frustration&quot; with things.<br />
<br />
The day had been a bit of an adventure with a trip to Seattle where Melissa was able to get some formal wear that she wear to her father and Virginia&#39;s coming wedding. She&#39;d gotten a few other small things to augment what Erma Tyson had given her the previous night, but it was all relatively plain in design and despite her father&#39;s comments about his wallet, what was purchased actually wasn&#39;t that expensive. A lot of that had to do with the fact that she knew that as a werecow, certain measurements, even in human form, would be much bigger when she matured. Getting something fancy and expensive would be better saved for when she knew she wouldn&#39;t grow out of it. In the meantime, she could look forward to introducing her father to Trevor&#39;s parents and actually meeting Clint and Anna Bell, herself.<br />
<br />
Harold opened the door for her and she stepped up to find the wet and dreary weather that had been coming down since they drove back to Moon Lake from Seattle. It was pretty standard Pacific Coast weather, and thankfully had had no thunder and lightning and wasn&#39;t super hard, but that didn&#39;t mean that Melissa had to like it. As such she dashed forward and climbed into the front passenger seat of her father&#39;s car. He closed and locked the door to the house behind them and then soon made a similar dash for the driver&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least there&#39;s no thunder and lightning,&quot; Harold quipped to her as he climbed in and slid the key into the ignition, &quot;You&#39;ll provide directions, right? I&#39;ve been around a good portion of the town... but my tour didn&#39;t get out to your boyfriend&#39;s family farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded as the slight beeping tone indicated that the key was in the ignition while she and her father buckled themselves in. Once that was done and her father shut his door the beeping stopped. That only left the patter of rain on the hood and windshield. It wasn&#39;t long before the hum of the engine and the sound of the windshield wipers running across the glass was added to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can give you directions,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;You&#39;d go down to the school, but instead of turning into the parking lot as if to drop me off at school, you&#39;d go to the corner on the southwest corner of the high school and then turn left. You&#39;d then just follow that street all the way out of town. It&#39;ll transition to a gravel road, by which point you&#39;ll know you&#39;re entering the Tyson&#39;s farm/ranch property. They&#39;ll have a formal sign closer to the driveway and there are no turn offs. So you shouldn&#39;t be able to miss it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not that lost,&quot; Harold answered as he backed out and they began to drive along, which only made Melissa chuckle. With that he decided not to press things. They drove along and soon arrived at the Tyson farm, just as Melissa had directed. Harold noted the sign and also noticed a pair of trucks. Both were parked outside and next to decent sized looking field beyond it to his right. One truck was older and Harold recognized that as the one that Trevor had driven when he&#39;d visited the Jenkins home, the other was a bit newer but not by too much. Both thankfully had their windows up as Harold pulled up onto the driveway and parked next to them. &quot;And now for the rain-yard dash.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa chuckled and they both were quick to hop out of the car and soon run up the driveway, skirting across the corner of the front lawn to get onto the stones placed that lead from the driveway to the Tyson&#39;s front door. It wasn&#39;t that far and as they reached the door before either could knock on it, the door opened to reveal Trevor standing in the doorway to usher them in. Harold made his way in first with Melissa following behind him, though she ended with glomping Trevor. She added peck on the cheek to thank him for holding the door open for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel... you&#39;re gonna have to let me go so I can shut the door,&quot; Trevor said to her, though he was happy at the enthusiastic embrace with which she greeted him.<br />
<br />
Melissa released her hug and backed off slightly with a smile and a slight blush. Trevor then shut the door and moved to introduce his family. Harold looked to Trevor as he came forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Jenkins, welcome to our family farm and home... eh... sorry about the weather,&quot; Trevor began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s figured out a way to control it, so it&#39;s okay,&quot; Harold assured him. Trevor nodded and moved to begin the introductions. He started by moving toward a large and well built man, wearing a pair of fresh dark blue jeans and a button down shirt that by its scent, Harold guessed had to be freshly laundered. However, the thing that drew immediate attention was the man&#39;s size. Trevor generally stood taller than what Harold figured from a High School sophomore and would actually be comparable to college freshmen who&#39;d done a lot of working out. The man that Trevor approached was even bigger, standing taller than Harold and far more impressively built. Harold knew his own musculature had gotten bigger since becoming a weretiger, but he could tell that the man Trevor approached easily surpassed Harold. A part of Harold actually wondered if the man would be stronger than Harold&#39;s fursona even in human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my father, Jacob Tyson,&quot; Trevor spoke as Jacob reached forward to shake Harold&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... um...&quot; Harold began as he shook Jacob&#39;s hand and was impressed with the grip, &quot;You have a good grip, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never can go wrong with a firm handshake,&quot; Jacob gave a polite smile, &quot;and my wife and I have done our best to make sure our boys are raised right and will be respectful. Particularly as they grow into strong werebulls themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you?&quot; Harold wondered, still amazed at the muscle mass that Jacob Tyson carried. It wasn&#39;t overdeveloped to a point where it presented a health risk, but it was large and far larger than Harold had gained as a weretiger.<br />
<br />
&quot;In some ways... but not entirely,&quot; Jacob commented, &quot;werecattle and werehorses can have some variations in size and build depending on what their fursonas are based on. For werecattle... those breeds raised purely for meet or labor will be more muscular... and for werebulls more endowed, if you know what I mean. For breeds raised purely for diary, while they may have more muscle and size when compared to other were-species, that werebull would be smaller than all other werebulls. Breeds that were then bred to provide both meat and diary and actively used for both would then be in between the two extremes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And...?&quot; Harold wondered, not really knowing much about cattle and figured this would be a good lesson to learn.<br />
<br />
&quot;My fursona is based on the Braunvieh breed,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;a Swiss breed of diary cattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine is off of the Shorthorn breed,&quot; Jacob answered, &quot;and primarily the Beef Shorthorn part of the breed... though some breeders will say that the breed is all one group. As such the Shorthorn breed as a whole has been raised for meat and diary while the Beef Shorthorn is used for meat and the Diary Shorthorn for diary. Which will mean that I will probably always be stronger than Trevor... but that&#39;s something that relates to how a were&#39;s fursona develops. No one really knows the how or why. And in the end, Trevor is growing up into a responsible young man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have much to be proud of Trevor for,&quot; Harold told him, &quot;from what I&#39;ve been told, he&#39;s made Melissa feel safe and at ease here in Moon Lake, despite all the nonsense that has gone on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded as Trevor then moved on.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my mother, Erma Tyson,&quot; Trevor introduced his mother who came forward and shook Harold&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must thank you for offering some clothing to Melissa to wear,&quot; Harold spoke, doing his best to keep his eyes on Erma&#39;s eyes and not her chest. The woman was fully covered, but to say that her chest was large would be an understatement. Harold also noted that for a woman, Erma&#39;s shoulders were also rather wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Erma answered, &quot;and anything to welcome those who may be family one day. And besides... I&#39;ve been down Melissa&#39;s path before... Though, I became a werecow and then fell in love with Jacob while it would seem that your daughter fell in love with my son and then became a werecow. And I&#39;m just giddy to see them all happy together.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned a blush from both Trevor and Melissa that no one missed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides, as a werecow... Mel will have a lot of growing still to do,&quot; Erma continued, &quot;as werecows will have some of that same sort of size differences that a werebull would have. A mature werecow who&#39;s fursona is based on a beef cow will have more muscle and smaller breasts... though still larger than other female weres... in the H cup range. A mature werecow who&#39;s fursona is based on a dairy cow will have smaller muscle mass but larger breasts... in the J cup range. And a mature werecow, like myself, who&#39;s fursona... the Texas Longhorn... is based off of a breed used for both will be in between at 33I. So... it is the least I could do to help. Especially at present as Melissa&#39;s fursona is beautiful and strong with a russet reddish shade that&#39;s pretty solid... but then there are a fair variety of breeds with reddish colored coats that I couldn&#39;t say for certain... but best to help and be there for friends and potential family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I actually haven&#39;t seen Melissa in her new fursona,&quot; Harold admitted, &quot;but I again thank you for helping her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t seen it yet, well... we might have to fix that before you go home,&quot; Jacob commented, &quot;our farm house here was built by my family when we first moved to Moon Lake and was built with werecattle in mind. Many of the houses in town were built more for humans... part of the whole &quot;secrecy&quot; thing. She will have the room to transform here and not worry about goring the ceiling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold nodded and looked to Melissa, who&#39;d blinked but otherwise looked fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I could do that... though I didn&#39;t bring the robe you bought me, dad,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;so... I may ask that after dinner I have a moment in private to undress, transform, and then show you the new me... A Canadienne Werecow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Canadian?&quot; Harold wondered, &quot;we&#39;ve never even been to Canada.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Canadienne,&quot; Melissa corrected, &quot;it&#39;s a breed of diary cow that got its origins in the French settlements in Quebec and is pretty rare today... It&#39;ll mean that I&#39;ll be more than a handful when I grow up... that is what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve wondered on a lot with all that I&#39;ve seen,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;Just about every were I&#39;ve met is far healthier than what one would expect... I&#39;m now healthier and stronger than I ever was... it&#39;s all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Different?&quot; Jacob chuckled, &quot;that&#39;s just were society and how we&#39;re different from normal humans. The exact reasons aren&#39;t really known for sure. Those who believe in magic believe that the one that created the werevirus was a bit of pervert and thus designed it to bring out what people have generally found as &quot;sexy.&quot; Those who are more scientific think the virus has evolved in a way to encourage its perpetuation which then exaggerates those sorts of things and will vary from were-species to were-species. It&#39;d tend to say it is what it is and leave it at that... you&#39;re happy with what you&#39;ve become, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... Virginia McCoy... she&#39;s made me a lot happier than I&#39;ve been in a long while...&quot; Harold smiled, thinking on the weretigress who&#39;d turned him and had been having feelings for even before that fight with Alice Decrux.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa had told us you were engaged,&quot; Erma commented, &quot;congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you... and I&#39;m looking forward to next Saturday,&quot; Harold&#39;s smile remained, &quot;it may just be a justice of the peace... but it&#39;ll still be special...&quot;<br />
<br />
As he finished Trevor moved to the last two, &quot;and these are my younger siblings, Anna Bell and Clint. Anna getting closer to her fourteenth birthday  and when she&#39;ll have her first transformation. And Clint won&#39;t be too far away from turning ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold shook both their hands, though Anna Bell took the most interest in Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen you around school... but we don&#39;t share any of our electives and you&#39;ve often been with my brother when I&#39;ve seen you,&quot; Anna Bell began her comment to Melissa, &quot;And you&#39;ve smiled to him and him to you... and we&#39;ve heard a lot about you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems I&#39;m rather popular with you,&quot; Melissa to Anna Bell who was standing between her and Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s mostly interested because she knows her first transformation is coming up and is at least partially worried about what she will become,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;and because she knows it&#39;ll make me blush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I can&#39;t say what it will be like for you, Anna Bell, as I was born a normal human,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;My becoming a werecow has more to do with my feelings for your brother than anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna Bell beamed a grin that did make Trevor look nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll get married?&quot; Anna Bell asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tonight...&quot; Melissa spoke with a blush, &quot;I... I... I mean... we only just started seriously dating over the course of the past week and last night... being last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough, Anna Bell,&quot; Erma spoke, &quot;wouldn&#39;t want these two to get any redder... particularly as dinner is ready.&quot;</p>
