<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr Jacobs was stuck in the boys toilets in the amentiy block. After realising he had somehow changed into a female she had waited until there appeared to be no-one else in the block. Hearing the urinals flush and footsteps leave, she risked opening the cubicle door slightly to see if the coast was clear. She quickly shut and locked the cubical door when 2 senior students walked in. <br />
<br />
She sat there huddled and silent, fearing she would be discovered. How could she explain what had happened to her? No doubt she would have just as much success as the poor student in the gym. She had claimed to be Jake, a 16 year old boy, not Ruby. A claim that the principal had not believed, thinking the girl was just having some sort of breakdown. She now believed as she looked at her small feminine hands.<br />
<br />
What should she do? She couldn&#39;t go back to her office looking as she did. No-one would believe her story. She decided she needed to return to the gymnasium and find out from Ruby or Jake or who-ever she was how this might had happened. The girl had suggested it might have been the medallion she had been wearing. It quite possibly was. Mr Jacobs had felt a shock of electricity as she had touched it. She needed to get her hands on that medallion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile all she could do was listen to the teenage boys as they used the urinal. He didn&#39;t recognise their voices but one was telling the other &quot;Did you hear about Ruby Donaldson? Evidently Mr Cotter found her naked in the boys showers. I heard she gave him quite a flash! She has to be the easiest girl in the school! I&#39;ve heard she&#39;s a nymphomaniac!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can only wish it was me who had walked in on her! She is so stacked!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing the boys made Mr Jacobs wince. She felt the large orbs on her chest. She was now pretty well stacked herself. Had she, like the girl who claimed to be Jake, been turned into a copy of Ruby Donaldson? The large breasts and blonde hair made her suspect so. She needed to find a mirror.<br />
<br />
Eventually they left and Mr Jacobs used the opportunity to flee from the boys toilets into the girls toilets next door, knowing she would be less conspicuous there. She also knew there was no mirror in the boys toilets but that there was one in the girls block. She made the dash successfully ducking inside just in time as two students rounded the corner. She hoped she had not been spotted.<br />
<br />
The first thing she did was to look at her own reflection. Sure enough as she expected she was another Ruby Donaldson. The student who had claimed to be Jake had been telling the truth. She resolved to get back to the gym and &quot;Jake&quot; as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
But how to do that? She was still wearing her suit and tie. It was rediculously big on her. She would be noticed immediatly. She had shrunk from 6&#39;2 to about 5&#39;5. She was contemplating how to blend in somehow when she heard voices approaching. It sounded like girls, they entered the toilets before Mr Jacobs had a chance to hide in a cubical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Ruby&quot; said one of the girls. &quot;Has your class finished early?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Jacobs recognised her as Maddy, another cheerleader, She knew she was one of Ruby&#39;s friends. She decided to bluff her way out of the situation she found herself in and pretend to be Ruby. It would just be too embarrassing if her current plight became generally known.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Maddy, Stacey&quot; Mr Jacobs was momentarily stunned by the girish voice she now had. <br />
<br />
&quot;What on earth are you wearing?&quot; Maddy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Um my clothes got wet, The headmaster gave me his old suit to wear to cover me up&quot; it was the best excuse Mr Jacobs could think of at short notice. It sounded pretty lame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we heard. The rumour is you were naked under a towel&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want something a bit more appropriate?&quot; asked the other girl, she was Stacy Redmond, if Mr Jacobs remembered correctly. &quot;I just collected my cheerleader uniforms, did you know I&#39;m now on the squad?&quot; She held up a plastic bag and from it produced a blue and white cheer leader dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.... Congratulations.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can borrow one. I bought two&quot; The girl was holding out a clear plastic encased dress. &#39;I think we are the same size but it might be a little tight up top&quot;<br />
<br />
To cut a long story short. 5 minutes later Mr Jacobs emerged from the toilets wearing a cheerleader uniform. She had bare feet and no bra on underneath. The spandex top with &quot;Tigers&quot; emblazoned on it was a little too tight and the pleated skirt seemed incredibly short. She was just glad that she had worn bikini style undies today, that had strong enough elastic to stay up. She had gathered her shirt, suit and shoes in a bundle and made the dash across the school to the gym. She avoided eye contact with anyone during her dash and was relieved to see Ruby or was it Jake still lying down on the gym mat when she burst into Mr Cotter&#39;s office. She was also glad to see that someone had found some clothing for &quot;Jake&quot;, although the skirt and top she wore seemed made for a larger woman.</p>
