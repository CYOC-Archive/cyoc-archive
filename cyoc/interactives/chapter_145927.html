<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... There was a knock on the door and Richard brought said something towards the door which then opened revealing that girl. Richard seemed a little happy to see her which was ok, he was happy but Papo didn&#39;t quite like that it was her making him happy. However what was making Papo a bit happy was the fact that the girl had a scared look on her face and shortly after ran out of the room. <br />
<br />
What was happening was that Catherine had came back after having gotten some advice. She was told that since the only thing Papo understands right now is that she loves Richard and would probably do anything in her power to make sure nothing came between them... It may not quite be safe for her to be around till Papo can be taught some things. As such Catherine quickly told Richard, said they should put their relationship on pause, and left. Course with his frustration about the design, and the lack of his girlfriend he had for 6 years he was getting close to proposing to. He had started to weep. <br />
<br />
Seeing the love of her life so sad, she floated over to him, picked him up out of his seat with some pretty surprising strength, and gave him a tender hug against her soft body well petting his head. After being put back down Richard had bit of loathing in his heart. Whatever that butterfly was... It had distanced himself from his own love for who knows how long, and it and the cocoon had basically murdered his best friend. However he took a deep breath to try to calm down. <br />
<br />
He thought to himself &quot;Whatever... whoever this is, it&#39;s my model. Just a living mannequin at this point. Something new that doesn&#39;t deserve my hate... Although it&#39;s mother probably should&#39;ve kept her mouth shut.&quot; Looking at whatever was calling itself Papo and keeping in mind the word mannequin the process was a lot easier. Richard wasn&#39;t getting flustered by the gorgeous woman, at that point to him it was just a thing. Neither was he worrying about giving his best friend something bad, average, or even just pretty good as it for sure was not his best friend. As he sent it to the tailor who made it pretty fast and gave it for Papo to wear he had to admit he did some amazing work. When her mother saw her she thought she looked prettier than she did in her first dress, and everyone thought it was breath taking and enhanced her beauty. <br />
<br />
His father came by and said &quot;You&#39;ve done an amazing job with your first design. A small alteration or two and they&#39;ll fetch an amazing price.&quot; <br />
<br />
Richard thought to himself &quot;Right... we do get our money from this. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard compared to making the first one for her...&quot; then said &quot;Great,&quot; gesturing to Papo on him said &quot;Can we bring her away till she can at least speak common?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d be happy having Papo back. Is something wrong?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She isn&#39;t Papo, and with what this thing&#39;s mother told Catherine she left... It probably was the right thing who knows what someone without any common sense could accomplish, but I did have something in my pocket for Catherine.&quot; Richard dug into his pocket and pulled out a small ring box and continued &quot;I was going to propose to her... We could&#39;ve gotten married. With the research I had done I knew Papo wouldn&#39;t be quite herself, but we could&#39;ve taught her together like a mother and father. Instead Papo is just gone and Catherine is away for as long as this thing is like this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve gone through something similar in a way, her mother and me had a similar relationship after all. I&#39;ll say the longer you stay with her the more you&#39;ll see that she very much still is Papo... However if you really want it I can get security and have her sectioned away till she can at least speak basic common.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please do father.&quot; At which point Richard&#39;s father took out his phone, made a call, and Papo was taken to a different part of the building where she was isolated and a bit scared.</p>
