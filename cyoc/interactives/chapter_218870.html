<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your dad looks at you calmly before speaking. “When was the last time you had them?” he says very delicately but with a hint of nervousness.<br />
<br />
“I… I… I put them in my back pocket before we left for the mall. It was right after I turned into you and had gotten changed.” you answer unable to hide your worry in your dad’s voice.<br />
<br />
Your dad begins to pace around your parents’ bedroom as he focuses on what to do next. You have to admit, you find it admirable that he’s stayed so calm the whole time and didn’t even get upset at you for accidentally losing the socks.<br />
<br />
“Ok. I have a plan.” your dad announces, startling you from the sudden noise filling the silent room. “So you definitely had the magic socks right before we left, right?” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! I definitely had them in here. I even remember taking them off and putting them in my back pocket.” you answer confidently.<br />
<br />
“Then I have to assume they fell out in the mall.” your dad says. After he states this, you realize he must be right. <br />
<br />
Even though the socks could’ve fallen on the bus or on the walk to the bus, you highly doubt they fell out in those locations. Not only would’ve it had been noticeable if they had, but there wasn’t enough movement for the socks to slip out. It was only when you were in the mall that you began to move around more, such as: exercising in the mall’s gym, speed walking to areas in the mall, and being more active in the locations you visited.<br />
<br />
“Great! The socks are in the mall! Now what do we do?” you ask your dad, hoping he has an idea on how to find them.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s too late to go back to the mall now. Not only would we have to bring Tim with us, but I believe that the mall closes earlier today.” he states thoughtfully as he tries to stroke his goatee only to be met with a smooth face and remember his new lack of facial hair.<br />
<br />
“Then where does that leave us?” you respond, slightly disappointed that you couldn’t head back to the mall immediately to find them.<br />
<br />
“I think we’re going to have to keep up the act.” your dad says.<br />
<br />
“WHAT! Like forever!” you shout, but with your dad’s deeper voice it sounds more like you’re bellowing. Your heart begins racing as you begin to imagine what your new life will be like now that you were stuck as your dad.<br />
<br />
“Shh!” your dad shushes you as he waves his hands to calm you down. “I meant only for another day.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” you let out a large sigh of relief. “Ok. You really had me terrified for a moment.”<br />
<br />
“What? You don’t like my body?” your dad says insulted but in a joking manner.<br />
<br />
“No! That’s not true at all!” you say as you give your big belly a slight pat. “I actually really like it! I just don’t like the idea of having to live your life, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, so is that it?” your dad says a bit offended.<br />
<br />
“That’s not… you know… not what I meant…” you stammer.<br />
<br />
“I’m just pulling your leg, Son.” your dad says with a grin. “I also like your body but not enough to stay in it and live your life.”<br />
<br />
“Alright. I guess I deserve that.” you say as you now feel a bit insulted yourself.<br />
<br />
“Now back to the topic at hand.” your dad says with a more serious tone. “We’re going to have to stay as each other for another day and…” your dad begins before a sudden knock comes from the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
“Dad! Is the food here? I’m starving!” Tim says from the other side.<br />
<br />
Crap! You had forgotten all about Tim and dinner. You’re not even sure how much time had passed since you and your dad entered his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Let’s talk more later.” your dad whispers to you as he goes and unlocks the door.<br />
<br />
Tim opens the door and eyes the two of you with suspicion. “What were you two doing in here?” he asks.<br />
<br />
“I just had to have a talk with your brother, Tim.” you say, getting back into your dad’s role.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Tim responds uninterested before his eyes light up. “Well, are you already done ordering Dad?”<br />
<br />
“Not yet. I was just about to place the order.” you lie, although Tim doesn’t see through it. “Now why don’t we go get ready to order it together?”<br />
<br />
Tim cheerfully walks to the dining table as you and your dad follow him out of your parents’ bedroom. You look over to your dad and he does likewise. You both exchange a silent nod, as you both agree to keep up the act.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day occurs regularly as you call and place the order for delivery and pay for the food. Dinner is a bit more quiet than usual, as you and your dad don’t want to risk exposing yourselves. Luckily, Tim does most of the talking anyway, as he goes on and on about school and his interests. It’s not until you all three finish dinner and Tim is back in his bedroom that you and your dad resume your previous conversation.<br />
<br />
“Ok, so what were you saying before?” you ask your dad as you both head back inside your parents’ bedroom.<br />
<br />
“You did a good job acting as me son.” your dad says impressed as he closes the door quietly and locks it.<br />
<br />
“I was also thinking the same thing.” you say as you nod your head in approval.<br />
<br />
“Anyway… here’s what I was saying earlier.” your dad states, going back to answer your question. “We’re going to have to stay as each other for another day and find the socks in the mall tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“So what time will we both be leaving?” you ask your dad. However, you notice he’s now wearing an odd expression on his face. You recognize it as the same look you have when you try to hide something disappointing.<br />
<br />
“About that… listen son.” your dad begins to say calmly. “My job doesn’t allow me to use two or more absences in a row without a week’s advance.”<br />
<br />
“So… what does that mean?” you respond, not sure you like where this is headed.<br />
<br />
“That means that tomorrow, I’m going to skip another day of your school and head to the mall to look for the socks.” your dad says. “And while I’m doing that… you’re… going to… have to go to my job.”<br />
<br />
The whole room is filled with an awkward silence as your process your dad’s sentence. You begin to feel the same stress you felt earlier as you feel yourself on the verge of collapsing.<br />
<br />
Realizing you would now be heading to your dad’s job tomorrow, you feel stressed as you remember your dad’s job. “But, dad! You work as a…”</p>
