<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, does everybody present agree with the settings as they are?&quot; Jeff asked. &quot;Human and animal transformations, sex is enabled, reality gets adjusted, male, female and random transformations, and the winner is whoever gets to five first.&quot; He added, citing off the list.<br />
<br />
Beth and Frank nodded, but Abby traditionally stuck up a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do random transformations mean?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
A small lap of text popped up on the screen of the Frisbee shaped device between them.<br />
<br />
[Random transformations involve traits of one sex to be included in the transformation package of the other sex. If this is not included in the game, no players from one sex will receive exclusive traits from the other sex. When the animal package is included, this rule will be overridden by specific transformations from ambiguous creatures, like some amphibians.]<br />
<br />
Frank grinned mischievously. &quot;Watch out Abby, you might suddenly grow a cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
His girlfriend flushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does reality always get adjusted?&quot; Beth asked the device.<br />
<br />
[Not always. The adjustments depend on the transformation.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Everybody agrees, then?&quot; Jeff asked again.<br />
<br />
Nobody protested or shook their heads, so Jeff tapped &#39;enter&#39;, seeing another screen pop up before him.<br />
<br />
[Begin game] [Adjust settings]<br />
<br />
He clicked on the left.<br />
<br />
The text faded away and a spinning arrow appeared. The first person it pointed at, was Jeff&#39;s girlfriend, Beth.<br />
<br />
She sat there like she was caught red-handed, big eyes in surprise. She looked at the others, but nobody decided to step in, and she was given the go-ahead by Abby.<br />
<br />
Beth tapped on the arrow, and watched as it faded away, only for another text message to appear.<br />
<br />
[Grow cat ears]<br />
<br />
She raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s just weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
A tiny tingle spread over her scalp, slowly turning into a crazing itch. The others could only watch, mouth agape, as her human ears shrunk back into the sides of her head, and her hair seemed to part for two new appendages to grow out of her scalp. Beth was scratching the top of her head violently, feeling parts relief of getting rid of the itch, and a slight pleasure of hitting nerves she hadn&#39;t felt before.<br />
<br />
There was a low gasp from her right, and a loud, high pitched shriek, or squeak, rather, from her left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby?! What was that? Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you?&quot; Her friend basically shouted.<br />
<br />
Her hands rushed over to where her ears used to be. Simultaneously, the new muscles she felt jerked back abruptly, as her cat ears flattened themselves against her hair, hoping to muffle the sound overload it got from the transformation.<br />
<br />
Beth felt the sides of her head with her fingers, realizing her former human ears weren&#39;t there anymore. Next, they shot up to the top of her head, feeling the new cat ears perk up and twitch at the touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; She shouted, wincing as the sound impacted her hearing much more loudly than she had predicted. She continued with a whisper. &quot;I actually grew them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My god, Beth,&quot; Frank&#39;s loud baritone voice butted in, &quot;that looks so adorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shush.&quot; Beth hissed fiercely, covering her ears at the loud noise again. &quot;Keep your voice down please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy,&quot; Jeff muttered silently, as he picked at the tip of his girlfriend&#39;s newly grown cat ears, making them twitch at the touch as result.<br />
<br />
She slapped his hand away. &quot;No touching, it feels weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby blew against her ear, making her yelp, and the new appendage jerk and twitch violently once more, precisely the way a cat reacted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; Beth gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Abby whispered between chuckles, &quot;you didn&#39;t say no blowing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that&#39;s a rule as well.&quot; Beth smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff cleared his throat. They turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we now we know the game actually transforms people. Do you... still want to continue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank stared at Beth&#39;s cat ears for a second or two, then turned to his friend. &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t seem to harm people with the transformations right? Some enhanced hearing is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth nodded. &quot;I actually kind of like this,&quot; she said, daring herself to speak a bit louder. She wiggled her ears from side to side with surprising ease.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? Oh, yeah, it&#39;s fine by me.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if on cue, the arrow returned again. Turning clockwise in a rapid tempo until it ended up pointing at Frank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, please spare me game.&quot; He grinned, tapping the screen.<br />
<br />
[Grow a horse penis]<br />
<br />
Abby squeaked again, when she saw the message appear. The four of them realized the transformation sequence was initiated when Frank let out a grunt and grabbed his crotch. Not soon after, they saw how a large bulge started to form inside the right leg of his trousers, growing at a stop a quarter on the way down his thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oho. Ohohoho.&quot; Frank laughed excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How big even is that thing?&quot; Beth asked, almost hungrily. Jeff felt a pang of jealousy as he turned to her. A quick blow in her ear got her attention turned away to Frank&#39;s engorged crotch.<br />
<br />
Frank felt his cock grow semi erect, expanding slightly further in size, and growing in throbbing pleasure. He wanted to throw his pants of then and there, and have Abby either fuck, or suck him dry.<br />
<br />
He noticed his girlfriend staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;My eyes are up here sweetie.&quot; He said, pointing a finger at his face. His grin was provocative. Abby bit her lower lip in response, and leaned in on him ever so closely, slowly bringing a hand down his thigh. It was quickly met with the head of his enlarged penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a room, you two,&quot; Beth laughed.<br />
<br />
The arrow was pointed at Jeff this time.<br />
<br />
[Your anus turns into a vagina.]<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just-&quot; Jeff began, but he was interrupted by his own gasp, as pleasure erupted from his ass. His bowels became slightly looser as his asshole opened just a little wider. His anal muscles got slightly more strength and the inner walls from his anus lubricated a little more than they were supposed to. Simultaneously, lips formed on the outside, and a little nub formed right at the base of his scrotum, forming a small clitoris as a reward.<br />
<br />
He recovered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not unpleasant,&quot; he commented, still flustered at the new sensations. He twitched his anal muscles, and something leaked out of him. He was unsure what to think of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad for the first &#39;human&#39; transformation Jeff.&quot; Frank teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re becoming more and more sexual at each turn.&quot; Abby added.<br />
<br />
Beth came to sit on her knees behind Jeff. &quot;Is it the real deal?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t really check, Beth.&quot; Jeff said frustratingly. He felt weirded out at his own transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me.&quot; Beth whispered.<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced at Abby and Frank, who were flirting and telling each other sweet words while he saw Frank&#39;s crotch expand even further. Another unfamiliar sensation crept up from behind him, his nervous system assaulted by the pleasure of the involuntary twitches his anal pussy delivered.<br />
<br />
He scoffed, then sighed, removing his belt, and sliding his pants down far enough for only Beth to see. He kept an eye out on the other two.<br />
<br />
Beth gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; she said, feeling up and down his crotch, or at least the part right below it. He felt two of her fingers part two pieces of loose skin between his buttocks he&#39;d never felt before.<br />
<br />
Beth removed her fingers from his butt, and they came back wet and warm, not even having touched Jeff&#39;s insides.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Her boyfriend asked.<br />
<br />
She grabbed his right wrist and let them down his back. &quot;Feel for yourself big boy. Nothing you haven&#39;t felt before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not myself no,&quot; Jeff retorted.<br />
<br />
She led his fingers to his opening, and he slid them in, with another gasp.<br />
<br />
He moved them in and out. It grabbed Frank and Abby&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he said between moans. His own cock, the one he&#39;d had his whole life already, grew erect. He flushed some more, then removed his fingers from his new snatch, composing himself.<br />
<br />
Agitated he pointed at the device. The arrow was pointed at Abby, the last person not to have transformed yet. She tapped the screen, and waited in anticipation.<br />
<br />
[Rapid lubrication]<br />
<br />
She gasped and moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aghnnnn~&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up and removed her jeans. The others saw how her panties were already soaking in her own juices, and she basically jumped onto Frank, giving him a passionate French kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, stallion. Fuck me already!&quot;</p>
