<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff never got a visitor. He fell asleep waiting for Jenny.<br />
<br />
It was before dawn. Jeff looked at the time on his phone 4 am. Usually his parents wouldn’t get up till at least 7 on a Saturday morning, perhaps today they would be even later, as his father had been late home last night. He figured that gave him plenty of time for a quickie with Jenny who was sleeping in his sister&#39;s room. If nothing else he would get a chance to look at the MILF his girlfriend had become.<br />
He opened the door and listened. The house was quiet. This was his opportunity. First though he went to the bathroom, brushed his teeth and combed his hair. <br />
<br />
Satisfied that he looked half decent and was in his newest boxers (which he had worn last night, in anticipation of a visit from Jenny), Jeff made his way to his sister’s door. Opened it slightly and whispered ‘Are you awake?’<br />
<br />
After receiving no reply he assumed she wasn’t, so tiptoed to her bedside, planning to shake her awake and see if he could join her in the bed. However, in the darkness he didn’t see a shoe on the floor. Stepping on it was enough to make him stumble. He fell forward knocking a bedside lamp, which fell to the floor with a great clatter. <br />
<br />
Instantly the girl in the bed woke up. ‘Why the hell are you sneaking around in my room?’ a female voice demanded as she turned on a light. ‘Were you trying to pinch my purse?’<br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked. It wasn’t Jenny in the bed but his mother. Or should that be a 13 year old version of his mother. The girl had his mother’s hair and eyes, but was of course much younger. Jeff only now remembered the latest changes he had made on the Chronivac. ‘Ah…. It was an accident….. I just got lost in the dark. I must have walked into the wrong room’<br />
<br />
‘Bullshit! Caught you red handed! Dad! Daaad!’ The girl yelled out, loudly enough to wake the neighbourhood, let alone Jeff’s parents.<br />
<br />
In no time Jeff’s father was at the door. ‘What is it Irene?’<br />
<br />
‘I caught Jeffrey sneaking into my room. He was trying to steal my purse’<br />
<br />
‘I wasn’t… I.. I.. I was just going to the bathroom and took a wrong turn’<br />
<br />
His father did not look happy ‘Why can’t you two get along? Get back to your own room Jeffrey. I’ll talk to you later. It’s not even 5 am. You will have woken the whole neighbourhood!’<br />
<br />
‘I’m sorry Dad it was an accident. I didn’t see in the dark’ Jeff could see his father didn’t believe his story. He would no doubt be in a lot of trouble later. Meanwhile his best strategy would be to return to his own room and think up a better excuse.<br />
<br />
Lying back on his own bed could hear his father talking to Irene, apparently trying to calm the girl who was sobbing. He couldn’t make out the words through two closed doors. If his Mom was in his sister’s room where was Jenny? <br />
<br />
5 minutes later there was a knock on his own door. It was his father. He just said quietly ‘I don’t know what you were doing in Irene’s room and we will have a word about this after breakfast. Meanwhile I’m going back to bed. I was late home last night and have better things to do then sort out situations between you and your sister’<br />
<br />
‘I’m sorry Dad’ Jeff had decided being contrite was probably his best option. It seemed it was. His father left. Jeff was left to wonder what had happened to Jenny? She must be on the sofa bed in the lounge. No doubt his mother’s screaming would have woken her as well. He felt embarrassed.<br />
…….<br />
Jeff stayed in his room until he heard activity in the kitchen, it was quarter past 7. He must have dozed off again as he couldn’t remember much since his father had left. He got out of bed and made his way to the bathroom, only to find it already occupied by his 13 year old mother. When she finally flushed and emerged, the 13 year old stuck out her tongue at Jeff before saying ‘You’re going to be in big trouble’ <br />
<br />
Finally after relieving himself, Jeff made his way to the kitchen, there he found Jenny, looking incredibly sexy, in a short silky white gown with lace trimmings. As far as Jeff could see she was naked underneath. His penis responded immediately. He was only prevented from giving her a kiss and a cuddle by the presence of his mother also in the room.<br />
 <br />
‘Good morning Jeffrey’ said the MILF. She had a big smile on her face and seemed to be quite happy. <br />
<br />
‘Good Morning Jenny. Did you sleep well? I’m sorry about causing that commotion in the wee hours. It really was an accident’ That apology was also aimed at his mother, who once more stuck her tongue out at him<br />
<br />
‘I had an enjoyable night. I woke feeling very satisfied.’ Jenny replied, finishing the sentence with a giggle.<br />
<br />
Just then his father walked into the kitchen. His father was just in his boxers, naked from the waist up. Jeff shied a little knowing he was in trouble. ‘Morning Dad’<br />
<br />
‘Good morning Jeffrey, Irene’ his father replied. Jeff was a bit surprised that his father had not also verbally greeted Jenny. However, Jeff’s mouth was left gaping in total surprise when his father walked over to Jenny and greeted her with a warm hug and a mouth kiss. ‘We’ll Darling, shall we tell them?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes Jeff’ Jenny replied with another giggle<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised, his father’s name was also Jeffrey but everybody knew him as JJ, short for Jeff John his two first names.<br />
<br />
‘Kids, you are the first to know. Last night I asked Jennifer if she would be my wife. She agreed. We are going to get married in the Spring. Meanwhile Jennifer and Becky are going to move in this weekend. We plan to rent out Jennifer’s house.’<br />
<br />
Irene had a question, after all she was JJ’s wife! ‘Where’s Becky going to sleep? My room’s not big enough to share’<br />
<br />
‘We plan to make my office into a bedroom for Becky. I no longer work from home so we don’t need a dedicated office anymore. Becky will have plenty of room. It was used as a bedroom by the previous owners’<br />
<br />
Irene had another question ‘Can I be a bridesmaid?’ She had a big smile on her face. She seemed genuinely happy that Jenny was marrying her husband.<br />
<br />
Jenny replied ‘Of course you can. You and Becky will be my two bridesmaids. We’re not planning a big wedding. Been there, done that’ <br />
<br />
‘And son. You will be my groomsman, won’t you?’<br />
<br />
Jeff was taken by surprise at that question. Was he supposed to be happy about this?<br />
<br />
‘Son? Are you alright’<br />
<br />
‘He’s probably just in shock. Don’t forget we’ve had a whirlwind romance Jeff. It’s only been a year since his mother died. I’m sure he will come around in time&#39; she turned to Jeff &#39;We’ve always gotten on really well haven’t we Jeffrey?’ As she said this Jenny came over and gave Jeff a motherly hug, pushing her huge breasts against his body. ‘Don’t worry Jeffrey, I won’t expect you to call me Mom. Jennifer will remain fine”<br />
<br />
Jeff was still mute with shock. He had finally figured out what had happened though. It seemed Jeff’s father was now known as ‘Jeff’ instead of JJ and he himself was now known to everyone as ‘Jeffrey’. He now realised that changing Jenny’s relationship status to openly dating Jeff Hansen had set her up with his father - and thanks to his other changes, his mother was out of the way???<br />
<br />
Jeff had to get back to the Chronivac as quickly as possible and fix this mess.</p>
