<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What was that about?” Drake asked as he shifted off the bus and onto the street. It was about 18 minutes into the transformation, but neither of the boys were thinking or caring about that. After all, nothing was out of place.<br />
<br />
“Well... it‘s possible she can’t handle two guys on a date,” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
“Wrong, bucko,” Drake immediately responded. Jeff turned to him, confused. “Two *hot* guys on a date,” he finished with a smirk.<br />
<br />
The arcade was only a block away from the bus stop. Jeff loved showing off his boyfriend’s natural talent for video games, and Drake enjoyed seeing Jeff’s bewilderment in something so simple as shooting a creature on a screen.<br />
<br />
“C’mon - are ya ready to break the record on ‘Space Invasion’?”<br />
<br />
But as they began to walk toward the building, Jeff heard a subtle *rrrrrrrrrripp* - and turned to see Drake’s shirt had completely... well, exploded in half. The t-shirt could no longer contain four arms, and as it were, Drake’s arms were almost completely grown in. <br />
<br />
As far as the boys knew, though, this was an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction. Jeff began to laugh hysterically.<br />
<br />
“Dude!” Jeff squealed, “What happened!??”<br />
<br />
Drake was clueless. “I’m… I wore the … the wrong shirt…”<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to laugh at his misery. “Don’t you learn anything from me? Don’t try stuffing more than you can fit!”<br />
<br />
“Well, dang…” he said as he tried bending over to pick up the shreds. But his legs weren’t quite working right for some reason. He didn’t have the same range in motion, and his balance was unreasonably bad, like he was purposely walking and squatting at the same time.<br />
<br />
“That’s a phrase my Dad came up with to try and explain… here, let me help,” Jeff offered, lending a quick kiss as he picked up the remains from the sidewalk. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. Sometimes I have to go shopping to three or four different outlets. It sucks right now that everything is styled so tightly around the crotch.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know…” Drake said with a tone of dread, arms limp to his sides. “But now tonight’s ruined. They won’t let me in without a shirt.”<br />
<br />
It was true. No shirt, no shoes, no service. <br />
<br />
“And... can we sit down or something? You … know I can’t stand for a … long time like this.”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Jeff said. Drake plopped down on the bus stop bench, but was quick to shift his expanding body underneath him so that his abdomen had room. As he did so, his pants ripped in back and went kaput, just as fast as the shirt had. Even under six eyes, Jeff could see Drake’s blushing getting even redder as Jeff went to pick up the torn shreds of jeans from the sidewalk. For all intents and purposes, Drake was completely naked.<br />
<br />
“You sure thought, uhm... that this would be a good joke!” Jeff said awkwardly.<br />
<br />
“Don’t remember why it was funny, though…” Drake responded, distractedly.<br />
<br />
“Where’d you even get these?”<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know…”<br />
<br />
As the boys pondered, Drake’s rear legs began to grow in, and his front (original) legs took on a decidedly arachnoid design, which shifted his feet up like arches. Little tiny black hairs sprouted all over the bottom half of his body, and the feet and toes were pointed and dark.<br />
<br />
“Anyways… don’t worry. You know we’re downtown, right? We’ll just stop by Hansen’s first. They don’t close for another hour… I’m sure they’d whip up something for you.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, yeah!” Drake cheered up quickly. “You’re brilliant!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not brilliant… just resourceful.”<br />
<br />
“And clever, dude. I don’t know what I’d do without you someti--!”<br />
<br />
Jeff went in for a smooch. Drake returned the favor, and suddenly everything else didn’t matter. It turned into a long-needed makeout session and, under the pale light of the sun, it was the six minutes more that the transformation needed. As Drake’s stance continued to shift on the bench, the little black hairs on his four legs and abdomen grew longer. <br />
<br />
“We’re lucky to have each other…”<br />
<br />
From behind his back, the large mass of hardened abdomen pushed away, continuing to increase and grow in size. Another pair of legs extended down to the cement of the sidewalk. There was almost no space left for both Drake and Jeff on the bench itself.<br />
<br />
“I’m lucky to have someone like you... for what I am.”<br />
<br />
On either side of Drake’s goofy grin, two claw-like fangs were growing from the edges of his mouth. His eyes fluttered with anticipation and love.<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t matter what you look like. You care about me. That’s all that matters.<br />
<br />
Drake and Jeff went in for a hug. Jeff closed his eyes and squeezed, gently stroking each other’s back. As they cuddled, the second pair of arms from lower down wrapped Jeff around his waist and brought him closer in to Drake’s upper body. His twin hardons were being pressed against the front of Drake’s spider-like chest - delicate, sensitive, but strong. Right in front of his front set of legs... he knew Drake loved to have this area caressed and rubbed.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes of enjoyment, Jeff was the first to break the silence.<br />
<br />
“We should probably take care of your shirt and jeans situation, before the shops close...”<br />
<br />
Drake furrowed his eyebrows. <br />
<br />
“Jeans? … What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked and looked at the ground at the shredded pieces of fabric.<br />
<br />
“You mean… that?” Drake pointed.<br />
<br />
“Well…” Jeff hummed and hawed. <br />
<br />
Why did he just say that?<br />
<br />
“I didn’t bring any jeans with me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. “Y-yeah…” <br />
<br />
They stepped off the bench. It had been 30 minutes, and Drake’s body was anything but human. From the waist down, Drake’s six legs stood on pointed tarsals and his large abdomen were covered in short, furry, black and blond hairs. From the waist up, two pairs of arms and six glowing, black eyes accompanied Drake’s arachnoid complexion, complete with chelicera and fangs.<br />
<br />
“...But you did bring that shredded shirt.”<br />
<br />
“Sigh.”<br />
<br />
“So we have Mr. Hansen get you fitted, that’ll take like… 10 minutes?”<br />
<br />
Drake tentatively nodded. “Yeah. He’s usually got something ready for me these days… all I have to do is show up. It’s our little ‘deal’ for the silk.”<br />
<br />
“Even better,” Jeff said, hugging him once more from the side. “Then let’s go… C’mon, we’ll laugh about all this later.”<br />
<br />
Holding hands, Jeff and Drake walked away from the bench, leaving the shredded jeans and shoes behind. <br />
<br />
*-*<br />
<br />
Back at the house, Jeff’s computer, with the Chronivac still active, showed the transformation had completed. It began the 60-minute countdown to save, otherwise - as the directions at the beginning said - the changes would be reverted....</p>
