<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that day, Danni was making coffees for her customers when she saw her favorite customer walk up to the door. Biting her lip, she felt her eyes wander toward Hillary&#39;s huge rack. She quickly finished Hillary&#39;s usual (A Caramel Macchiato, extra sweet) and wrote her phone number on a piece of receipt paper, finishing just as the busty blonde came up to the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Hillary. It&#39;s on the house today.&quot; Danni said, with a smile. If she didn&#39;t have her tan, Hillary would be able to see her blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so sweet. Thanks, Danni.&quot; Hillary said, grabbing the drink and the receipt. As Hillary left, Danni felt her heart beating, distracting herself by looking at Hillary&#39;s well defined ass.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Hillary arrived home, grabbing the paper that was next to her now finished drink. She smiled to herself, putting the number in her phone.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Andrew was hiding in his school&#39;s library. There were studying rooms, and he&#39;d ducked into one. He&#39;d seen Dakota and couldn&#39;t believe how hot she was. He&#39;d always had a crush on her, but now... a shiver went up his spine. She really looked good. Andrew decided to go through with something that he&#39;d been debating for a while, and decided to type his specifications into the Chronivac...<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Danni showed up to Hillary&#39;s house. She&#39;d been a bit shocked when she got the text, but she couldn&#39;t pass this up. She&#39;d wanted Hillary since the first day Hillary showed up. She&#39;d showed up without underwear; she wondered if Hillary would say something. &quot;I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s why she called me.&quot; Danni thought to herself, though she hoped she was wrong.<br />
<br />
Hillary opened the door. &quot;Hi, Danni. Come in.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
Danni looked at Hillary. She was wearing a fuzzy pink bathrobe... and not much else. Danni followed her in and closed the door behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, wanna get started?&quot; Hillary said with a smile, as she dropped her robe and revealed her naked body.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Andrew finished his specifications and hit &quot;enter,&quot; feeling a pleasurable energy fill him. His body morphed and changed, his bones cracking, his sex organs inversing...<br />
<br />
And suddenly, Andrew was Andrea, a perfect female copy of his formerly male self. She was tall and skinny, just like Andrew, but she a pair of A-cup breasts and a slightly more rounded rear. She pulled her phone out and looked at herself through the front camera; she obviously took better care of herself than Andrew had as a guy. She had a bit of makeup on her face; if Andrea had seen herself on the street, she&#39;d call herself downright cute. She was wearing a cute outfit, too; the worn out sweatpants and hoodie were now well fitted and newer versions of themselves made for her now female body.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d used the Chronivac to protect herself a bit, too; her mother, regardless of her telepathic abilities, would never realize that Andrea had been the one to put this whole thing into motion, and no one else would be able to discover the Chronivac due to a new clause she&#39;d added. She had altered her mother&#39;s mind for her not to develop too close a relationship with Dakota; she&#39;d subconsciously want her &quot;daughter&quot; to hook up with Dakota instead. Checking everything and making sure it was all correct, Andrea was satisfied. She packed her laptop into her bag and headed out.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Hillary was riding Danni with a double ended dildo, kissing her neck and grabbing her average tits. Hillary felt herself about to cum; she shoved her tongue down Danni&#39;s throat, and the two girls came together.<br />
<br />
Hillary felt her already taut stomach become fit; her abs became a bit more noticeable, her breast implants growing another two sizes, her ass soon following. She knew her transformation was reaching its end; she was quickly becoming the version of herself she&#39;d dreamt up. While she relished the changes, she was far more interested in watching Danni change.<br />
<br />
Danni was recovering next to her. Her breasts gained implants, just like Hillary and Dakota&#39;s. The natural B cups grew to enhanced DD cups, firm and proud on Danni&#39;s chest. Danni&#39;s already athletic rear grew to match her new chest. Her makeup became a bit heavier, her abs a bit firmer, her arms a bit more muscular. Danni looked sexier, but Hillary noted that she looked... sluttier, too. Her hair was thicker, and even through half closed eyes, Danni had a far more seductive look in her eyes. However, Hillary needed Danni gone, at least for the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, I wish I could stay here foreverrrr.&quot; Danni was thinking, basking in her post orgasm glow.<br />
<br />
Hillary focused a bit; she hadn&#39;t had to change Danni&#39;s thoughts at all so far, but this was relatively easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, that was nice but I really should go home.&quot; Danni was now thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hate to kiss and tell, but I think I need to get home, babe. See you at the coffee shop?&quot; Danni said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, sure, babe. Maybe I&#39;ll see you again here.&quot; Hillary said with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you sure will. See you soon, Hillary.&quot; Danni said, finishing getting dressed and getting ready to head out.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Andrea didn&#39;t know how this would go. She&#39;d altered reality so that no one else would notice, but she knew Hillary would. Her main plan was for Hillary to set her and Dakota up, and she was willing to use the Chronivac to do that. However, she figured she&#39;d feel things out first. She used to her key to open the door, and walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom.&quot; She shouted out, as she&#39;d done as Andrew a thousand times before.<br />
<br />
She heard her mother running in, seeing her wearing a dress and high heels. She looked... different than before. Bustier. Sexier. Sluttier. Andrea tried to wave these thoughts today. Andrea noticed she looked a bit unnerved.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, mom? You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&quot; Andrea said, trying to be casual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Um. It&#39;s... it&#39;s nothing sweetie. How are you doing?&quot; Hillary said, trying to stay composed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing fine. Oh, here&#39;s your credit card.&quot; Andrea said, handing Hillary the card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. Um. Goodnight, I guess. I&#39;m going out for a bit.&quot; Hillary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing mom, see you later.&quot; Andrea said.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Hillary paced around outside. She wanted to go clubbing, but she wasn&#39;t expecting her son to... be her daughter instead. And Hillary didn&#39;t like the thoughts she was having. The need to corrupt women now apparently included Andrew- or Andrea, as she now thought of her has. However, suddenly, that voice came back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Go with the flow. Everyone will feel amazing.&quot; It told Hillary. And Hillary felt herself listen, even though she didn&#39;t want to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll worry about this tomorrow. Time to go out instead.&quot; She thought to herself.</p>
