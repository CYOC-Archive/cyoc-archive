<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin started to cry. So people reacted and reached him and Tyler to ask what happened.<br />
&quot;Little bro, why are you crying?&quot; asked a man 12 feet tall with huge biceps. He weared sleevless shirt to show them up.<br />
&quot;Did you brother hit you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, you&quot; -- the man talked to Dustin, &quot; You should not mock your smaller brother, look at him, he is so ill. Where is your parents?&quot;<br />
&quot;Dustin, can you please explain this man what is going on?&quot; Tyler asked Dustin to help him.<br />
Dustin with sobbing and eating his own tears, replyed &quot;No, sir. He did not do anything to me. I&#39;m crying because I&#39;m so small&quot;<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, little guy. It is not your fault. You need to eat properly and you will grow bigger than your older brother. And I&#39;m sorry for bad questions&quot; the man turned to Tyler. &quot;Ok, good luck. Have a good day&quot;<br />
&quot;You are a good person&quot; told Ty. &quot;have a good day too&quot;<br />
Than Dustin felt warm in his stomach. Than he became 1 inch taller. &quot;Ty?&quot; he asked his brother. &quot;So, now you see. You didn&#39;t lie, that&#39;s how old Dustin would do. But you didn&#39;t and that&#39;s why you grew&quot;<br />
When they finished to eat Mark and June had come. Now they were giants too. Mask was the biggest of them all, his belly was really big and he had a double chin. June was the slimmest one, her breasts were bigger and her body was slim but musclular. She was taller than Ty now.<br />
&quot;OK. We bought everything we need. Let&#39;s go home&quot; said June and they all left the mall.<br />
In the car Mark set with June and Ty was on the second row. June opened a door for Dustin and asked him to sit in special child chair.<br />
&quot;No, please. I want to be with you. Please, let me ride on your lap&quot; cried Dustin.<br />
&quot;It is a dangerous, you know, baby. What if we will crash?&quot;<br />
And June raised Dustin and put him into the chair. She buckled him up. Then she went back to the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
&quot;Mom, I&#39;m sorry, please let me sit on Ty&#39;s lap.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but your chair is better for you.&quot;<br />
Suddenly, Dustin felt that belts became loose. He was shrinking. &quot;I&#39;m complaining too much&quot;, he understood. The road back was in silence. When they left the car Ty told him that Dustin lost 2 inches. He was about to arguing about it but he told Ty &quot;Yes, I understand why&quot; And than he grew 1 inch back.<br />
<br />
When they got in the house, June asked Ty to help her with putting groceries away and Mark took Dustin to his room to play with him.<br />
Ty and June were in the kitchen.<br />
&quot;So, how are things with Dustin?&quot;<br />
&quot;He is trying. But he is a teenager. It is a hard time for him.&quot;<br />
&quot;You are a great brother. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next day Dustin woke up. He thought that yeasterday was a nightmare till he found out that his room has childish design. Also there were books how to raise the kids who were dwarfs and other disadventeges. The door opened and June came. She told him that she was going to take him to school.<br />
&quot;But, mom, I&#39;m too big for it. I am already in senior year.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, no. You are in forth grade. Let&#39;s go, darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
In school his first class was a sport class. Dustin went to the changing room. It was full of the guys his new age but they were at least 6 feet tall and had huge muscles. They looked at him like he was an alien.<br />
&quot;So, little boy, why are you here? Are you lost?&quot;<br />
Dustin was silent. He was not able to answer.<br />
&quot;Hey, stop doing it. Let him in&quot; <br />
Dustin changed his clothes and went out to the field. The teacher was also a giant.<br />
&quot;Hello, boys, today we will be running laps. Who will run faster and stronger will gain points for his class.&quot;<br />
Dustin was running much slower than everyone and even teacher told that his result he would not count. Dustin felt so bad, but he decided not to cry. With his decision he felt like he grew again, again, just an inch, but it was a good sign.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day Mark came to take him back. When he called Tyler someone from his class yelled &quot;Hey, dwarf, your fatty mommy with a beard came&quot;. <br />
&quot;Shut up, you are a moron.&quot; replied Dustin. He didn&#39;t recognise but he grew a little bit because he defended his father.<br />
In the car Mark was talking to him about his day and asked how was school.<br />
&quot;I have a feeling, that it was not a good day.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why? Is someone bullying you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, but my teacher doesn&#39;t count my results, cause I&#39;m so small.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dustin, I believe that he did it just to help you avoid the class anger&quot;<br />
When they arrived at the house Mark went to the kitchen to find June, and Dustin was looking for Tyler. Tyler was in the basement, lifting in their home gym. When they saw each other, Tyler hugged him.<br />
&quot;How was your day, buddy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not the best, but I think I can manage&quot;<br />
&quot;Great. So, let me finish here. And if you want, you also can train here. But in this case I may have to buy a smaller plates for you&quot;<br />
Dustin noticed that Ty was bigger than before. His shirt was even tighter and had holes in it. He could easily see his nipples.<br />
&quot;Ty, your shirt, it&#39;s too small. Why do you even have it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you like my &#39;JOCK&#39; t-shirt, brother?&quot;<br />
&quot;I do, but it is so tight, it was new and much bigger on you&quot;<br />
&quot;Ehm...&quot; Ty giggled, &quot;You know, I figured out that in this world I&#39;m too small even for 17 years old, so I grew a little bit&quot;<br />
&quot;So, how big are you now&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 8 feet 2. And I&#39;m going to grow more&quot;<br />
&quot;So, are you the biggest?&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to be. I see you grew too today, 2 inches. Not bad! I&#39;m so proud of you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, I guess I&#39;m starting to understand what an asshole I was&quot;<br />
With this words Dustin grew 2 more inches and he felt his frame became a bit wider too.<br />
&quot;Dinner&#39;s ready!&quot; June was yelling.<br />
They went upstairs and to the in the kitchen. The table was full of food and Mark and June were already eating.<br />
Tyler helped Dustin to sit down on his special higher chair and than took his own place. &quot;If you want to grow I have to eat more,&quot; he told Justin. &quot;My magic is helping your height and bone structure, but muscles are your own responsibility&quot;<br />
Than he started to eat his chicken and mashed-potato with protein powder. With every spoon and bite Tyler&#39;s muscles were growing, and he could hear how his pants and shirt were ripping. &quot;Tyyyy....&quot; Dustin was worried about it &quot;Is that fare?&quot; Tyler looked at him and replied &quot;My wishes are mine wishes, this is how I grow. You have another way. And do not ask something like that, it is envy and it&#39;s not good for you&quot; <br />
&quot;Mom, do we have adds?&quot; Ty asked. June brought him another plate.<br />
&quot;Ty, you didn&#39;t understand me&quot; Dustin continued to talk to Ty. &quot;I&#39;m worry that you are loosing your clothes. Is it okay&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmmm... you are right.&quot; His T-shirt and pants recovered and became fitter to his actual size of 8&#39;2 and 450 lbs.<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot;<br />
&quot;You are welcome, brother&quot; And than Dustin feet touch the floor.<br />
Mom, I guess Dustin is big enough to have a normal chair. Look, this one is small for him.<br />
&quot;Hmmm... you are right. I&#39;m so happy that Dustin starts to grow. May be these new vitamins are really good&quot; <br />
&quot;And you Tylre should have taken a shower&quot; June said, and added, &quot;You smell like a sweat. No dinner before shower next time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure mom. And can I have more food please&quot; Tyler respond &quot;This time&quot; he highlighed.<br />
When he was going to the shower he were 8&#39;2 and 470 pounds of pure muscle. No so special in this universe, but something noticible.<br />
He was thinking about his brother. He was kind and helpful and that was good, so he wished him to add 20 pounds of muscles. By the way, not only Dustin have to be a good person.</p>
