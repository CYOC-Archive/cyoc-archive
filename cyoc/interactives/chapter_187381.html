<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After another ten minutes of just thinking what they could do, Kevin switched on the tv. “Let´s just watch something, maybe we get an idea.” <br />
Luke didn´t argue that. He was still as clueless what they could do now than his brother. While Kevin laid on the couch, he laid down just before it, head just below his brothers. He had always liked that carpet, and as a wolf, it felt right to lay down on the ground, even just for role-playing.<br />
A couple of minutes later, Kevin started to scratch Luke behind his eyes and pet him on the head, and Luke didn´t protest it. In fact, he enjoyed it, it felt really nice. It didn´t take him long before he was relaxed enough to fall asleep below his brother.<br />
Kevin was still thinking what they could do. He enjoyed petting his brother, as the wolf´s fur was really soft to pet. It woke the desire to have a real pet, that had been quenched by their father years ago. He doesn´t want to have a pet, as they make to much noise, or are dirty, or need much care.<br />
Suddenly, Kevin got an idea. Yes, he had somewhat promised Luke to not alter his speech or mind, but what if he simply tried it? He could switch it back later, right? He couldn´t be to sure if Luke would like it, but he would rather get hit by his brother if he not enjoyed it, then doing nothing. And Luke was a kill-joy, as he didn´t want to really act like wolf, much less a dog.<br />
Still petting his now sleeping brother, Kevin eyed the remote again, still in his reach on the table. Carefully, to not wake Luke up again right now, he slowly extended his arm over and grabbed it. What was a little experiment with that function, anyway?<br />
Eyeing his brother, Kevin pushed the think button once. Nothing seemed to happen at first, disappointing Kevin a bit. Maybe it didn´t work while Luke was asleep?<br />
At the same time, Luke felt some kind of paralysis wrap around him. “What´s happening?” he asked himself, suddenly fully awake.<br />
Then he felt it, something was happening inside his head, something that developed some kind of fear in him. But it took longer to realize what exactly was happening to him. “Oh no, what did alpha do? It´s wrong, stop … No, alpha, you didn´t … Argh…” The more he tried, the more his focus slipped away from him. He didn´t notice he thought of Kevin, his younger brother, now as his alpha wolf, his leader.<br />
Somehow, hitting the think button on the remote resulted in his memories being repressed, his way of thinking changed, everything was messed up for a couple of seconds. Which felt like an eternity to Luke, as he lost more and more of himself to the wolf he was, has ever been. No, he wasn´t a wolf, was he?<br />
Then everything cleared up inside his head, his whole existence rewritten into being a wolf, his alpha´s loyal beta. And with that, the paralysis left him, and he opened his eyes again. At the same time, he let his tongue roll out his muzzle and sighed relaxed.<br />
That startled Kevin a bit. Why was Luke suddenly… Then he realized that the button did work, just it needed some time. Suddenly fearing what would be his answer, but also needing to know, he asked the wolf: “How does it feel? Enjoying it?”<br />
Luke´s voice was even rougher and deeper than before, something sounding wilder as well as he answered: “Goood, yeahhh… keep scratching there, alphaaa.”<br />
Kevin stopped at that, surprised. “Alpha?” he asked.<br />
Luke butted his head upwards, someway petting himself against Kevin´s hand. “You´re my alpha, what else? Don´t stop” Luke said.<br />
While he resumed his petting and scratching Luke, Kevin thought about it. “He sees me as in charge? I know that packs of wolves have alphas, but how much did that think button change his brother? Was he even in there still?<br />
“Any ideas what we could do now, Luke?” he then asked the relaxing wolf.<br />
“I would like to run for a bit, alpha. Maybe playing outside? Cavort together?” Luke suggested. Even if he liked being petted by his alpha, he felt a bit restless, having too much energy right now.<br />
“Okay, let´s get outside then.” Kevin switched the tv off and stood up before he headed to the back door. There garden was fenced high, so nobody would see Luke easily. And as Kevin had no leash, he couldn´t go outside with him. While he was sure that Luke would be staying with him or come back if called, other´s may be frightened by a wolf, or complaining about the missing leash.<br />
It was a fun time outside. Luke, as a wolf in mind, had no problem playing fetch with his alpha, or to simply run around the garden. Kevin was a bit hesitant to cavort with his brother turned wolf, fearing he would get hurt. But even as Luke was a beta wolf, he could convince Kevin he would be careful with him. And for a wolf, he really was. Kevin suffered one scratch on his arm, and that wasn´t really Luke´s fault.</p>
