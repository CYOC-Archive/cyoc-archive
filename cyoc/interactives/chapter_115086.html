<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The blindfold William was made to wear was proving to be more of an annoyance. While able to tell that he was getting a blowjob; trying to discern who was giving it to him was the issue. He knew it wasn’t Frances nor was it Samantha: William could hear those two yowling in unison as they had their respective fun. That left his wife Martha and this crazy were-cheetah that Frances and Samantha knew; yet at this time decide to keep mum as to who she is.<br />
<br />
Before he was made to put the blindfold on, William got a good look at the lithe feline guest. Sporting a traditional yellowish orange coat of fur with black spots and a white underbelly for fur. Her tail ended with a white tuft of fur. Green eyes, rounded ears and a black nose capping a muzzle; William could tell this were-cheetah was roughly six feet in height. Her well-endowed breasts and voluptuous figure making him horny as she stood in such a way that granted him a clear view of her genitals and the dew giving the exposed pink flesh a glossy look.<br />
<br />
That was then and this is now. Having to rely on his sense of smell and hearing; William was about to growl as he felt his release coming when a familiar scent blasts his muzzle. Blowing his load, William was immediately treated to his wife’s sex as she squatted over him; lowering herself onto his muzzle as she started to kiss and make out with the were-cheetah.<br />
<br />
“Now don’t wear out the were-foxes just yet,” Frances speaking up; “we do have the whole night for fun.”<br />
“I’m aware,” the were-cheetah answering; “and I must say, Martha here is very willing with the fun I have planned. William however,” the were-cheetah pausing to look at the were-fox she and Martha have pinned under them; “needs some encouraging.”<br />
“William loves giving anal,” Martha running her paws all over the were-cheetah body.<br />
“But does he like to receive it,” The were-cheetah grinning.<br />
“What,” William escaping the woman above them; “what are you getting on about?”<br />
“I’m going to show Martha how to give you a different kind of pleasure,” the were-cheetah speaking; “think of it as the Kama-Sutra for were’s.”<br />
“And with you here,” Samantha nuzzling the were-cheetah; “we could have a daisy-chain going with the four of us girls.”<br />
“Yeah sure,” the were-cheetah shrugging; “I guess it’s good to go back to the basics now and then. But first,” the were-cheetah looking at William; “mount your wife and show me what you can do.”<br />
<br />
William looked confused at first; staring at the were-cheetah as she waited for him to approach. Seeing Martha already assuming the position and displaying her sex towards him; William approach with some trepidation. What is the were-cheetah going to do? Will she become aggressive again? Why is she holding onto the massive dildo that looks like a were-horses penis?<br />
“Come on William,” Martha begging; “fill me up good.”<br />
<br />
Approaching as he can smell Martha’s desire; his vulpine penis standing erect as he gets behind her. Lining up as he leans forward he plunges into Martha and starts to yip and growl as he feels her sex clamp down on him tightly. Rhythmically thrusting in and out as he probes his wife’s sex and exploring her body with his paws.<br />
“That right,” the were-cheetah observing; “give Martha a good rutting, use your paws to stimulate her entire body before you start to bear down on her.”<br />
“Frances and Samantha told me what our observer here does,” Martha panting as she revels in the thorough fucking she is receiving; “she… is… a…”<br />
“Aha,” the were-cheetah speaking; “don’t spoil things just yet Martha, just let yourself melt away as William mates with you.<br />
<br />
Martha was moaning as she felt her husband’s paws brush over her nipples as they peak out of their furry confines; the rough callouses and claws causing her body to tense up like a coiled spring waiting to explode. Feeling her husband shifting his weight as he begins to place his paws on her shoulders giving him added leverage. Gasping as his knot invades her canal filling her up even more as a she feels the pressure building within her.<br />
<br />
For William’s part his thrusting has slowed down, yet has become more deliberate and forceful. Grunting as his knot causes him to push and pull with greater effort; he grips his wife hard by the shoulders as he can feel his balls clenching and churning in his furry scrotum. Feeling a pressure build in the base of his shaft as he makes a few final thrusts before growling as he releases his load into Martha’s eager womb.<br />
<br />
The were-cheetah observed the entire frenzied act of mating; noting that it took only a few minutes; she clucks to herself.<br />
‘We have a lot to do in the course of the evening to turn this were-fox couple into a proper set of swingers.’<br />
“All right,” the were-cheetah speaking; “as soon as your knot deflates William, we begin with the night’s entertainment.”<br />
“And what would that be,” William gasping; “I don’t even know your name or what you do, or why you are even here.”<br />
“My name is Greta,” the were-cheetah answering; “I am a physical fitness and yoga instructor for the Rec Center by day. By night,” the were-cheetah grinning; “I’m a love instructor. Teaching couples and single were’s the art of maximizing and enhancing the act of rutting. Be it with nothing more than your paws and born equipment,” Greta grinning; “to using props and toys. And for the extreme clients,” Greta growling; “I double as a dominatrix.”<br />
<br />
“We prefer to use our paws and tongues,” Samantha hugging Frances; “but now and then we’ll use a bit of food to liven things up.”<br />
 “Whip cream bikini,” Greta looking at the were-cat couple.<br />
“Complete with cherries,” Frances purring.<br />
“Well I got something even better than that,” Greta grinning; “some edible treats from It’ll Be our Secret.”<br />
“The sex store,” Frances perking up; “I thought they only sold erotic clothing?”<br />
“Sex store,” Martha coming out of her orgasmic haze; “tell me more of this place!”</p>
