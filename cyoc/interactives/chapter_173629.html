<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle headed towards the bathroom. With his coordination returned, the strides were effortless. However, with the diaper between his legs, he was forced to do a slight waddle, where his hips led his steps instead of his legs. He made it to the bathroom, where he quickly undid the pacifier clip, tore off the onesie, and was met with the sight of his... the new diaper. He saw himself in the mirror, and paused. He examined what he looked like. Red, puffy eyes from being upset. Slight stubble from where he didn&#39;t shave this morning. Brown hairs all over his chest. Definition to his arms, and only a slight paunch to his stomach. A huge, frilly, sky-blue diaper on his groin, covered with designs of balloons, and unicorns, and clouds. And for some reason, he wasn&#39;t taking it off. He was examining it.<br />
<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t figure out why he was curious, but he reached for the onesie again and put it back on. He buttoned it at the bottom. He looked at the mirror again. The navy-blue onesie, covered in fish, now adorned him. He then took the pacifier that was on the counter, and reclipped it to his chest. He stood there, holding the pacifier, and looking at the mirror in a confounding mix of trepidation and morbid fascination. He could look at the mirror, because the mirror wasn&#39;t him. Kyle&#39;s reflection was wearing those things. He could handle that. And so, as his curiosity got the better of him, he guided the reflection to stick the blue pacifier back in its mouth. The reflection was now fully clothed as a baby, just like Kyle was a few minutes ago. &quot;This is what I looked like,&quot; Kyle thought.<br />
<br />
Indeed, this is what anyone looking at him would have seen. A grown man, wearing a diaper, onesie, and pacifier. Sucking on the pacifier no less. The reflection gave some experimental sucks. This was the overgrown baby that the Chronivac created. What that dragon created. What lovely Falstaff created. It already felt like a dream to Kyle, even though Kyle was being rocked to sleep in his arms not ten minutes ago. Those big, strong, red arms. Those reassuring arms of safety. Kyle loved that feeling, and he relished the memory of it even now. He looked at his reflection, sucking away at the pacifier. This is what Falstaff saw, and yet Falstaff was more than eager to take care of him. Kyle was no longer trapped in his infantile state, but the trappings remained, and even now, looking at his reflection, they gave him comfort. That comfort was what let him look down at himself. He was indeed wearing the blue onesie, sporting the diaper bulge. And that was Kyle who was sucking on the pacifier. And when he looked down at himself, nothing bad happened. He didn&#39;t lose his job, he didn&#39;t get a divorce, and nobody laughed at him. Here in the bathroom, he could experience the clothing in a vacuum.<br />
<br />
Kyle took the opportunity that the mirror presented, and examined himself. He turned around, and saw his reflection&#39;s back over his shoulder. The fish design continued onto the back of the onesie, and he saw a vague outline through the cloth, showing where the padding of the diaper began and ended. &quot;Man, there&#39;s a lot of back padding,&quot; he mused. And of course, he knew from personal experience it was for good reason. He looked at himself from the side, and the back padding became much more prominent. He stuck out his butt, and the size of it floored him. His thoughts immediately turned to Trevor. In their most intimate moments in the bedroom, Kyle&#39;s ass belonged to Trevor. Trevor did whatever he pleased with his ass. Kyle especially liked when Trevor spanked it. It sent a jolt of pain and excitement throughout his bum, and the rush traveled right up his spine and lit him up. Now Kyle was dressed as a baby, and his butt was even bigger. He gave his ass an experimental slap. He could barely feel it under the padding. But he then imagined Trevor slapping it. Spanking his butt, like the naughty baby he was. Like the naughty baby he was dressed as. Kyle suckled the binky furiously. He was wearing some impressively thick padding, but this thought still gave him such an outrageous hard-on that it still showed through the diaper. Kyle adjusted his crotch to prevent his dick from getting crushed, but he couldn&#39;t deny: the thought of being with Trevor like this aroused him.<br />
<br />
Being a baby around his husband made Kyle the horniest he had been in a long time. And Kyle thought back to earlier today when he was a temporary baby: even though his mechanical age was 1, he still remembered a couple times when he was hard, but he simply pushed it out of his mind at the time so he wouldn&#39;t have to think about the implications. Back when he was being bottle-fed, or when Falstaff was wiping around his erection as he was changing the poopy diaper, he had other things to think about. Now, it all came to the forefront. This whole experience had awoken something in Kyle. And he wanted more. Trevor had suggested he get into the shower, but Kyle was afraid that if he took all of these things off, he wouldn&#39;t be able to put them back on again. He was faced with a snap decision: go in the shower and possibly lose all of this forever, or walk back outside explore something new. And this monumental decision terrified him.<br />
<br />
Trevor was crawling through the extensive Chronivac software when he heard Kyle re-enter the room. He looked back to see that instead of wearing a towel and residual shower water, Kyle was still in baby clothes. And apparently he was holding his breath, because as soon as he stepped into the room, Kyle blurted out &quot;I wanna talk.&quot; Trevor looked back at the computer screen as if he was checking something, but all he really wanted was a couple seconds to process the situation. &quot;Uuuuhhhh... sure thing, bud.&quot; He sat on the bed, and patted right next to him. Kyle took the cue and sat down, and was taken aback as Trevor scooched hip-to-hip, and gave him a shoulder hug. Kyle had psyched himself up in the bathroom, but the words seemed so far away now. He began, &quot;I...&quot; Eight seconds passed, and Trevor offered, &quot;... need some water?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Kyle said almost instantaneously. He gave a bashful grin as Trevor grabbed his hand and led him downstairs, disregarding how Kyle had swallowed all of his words in stage fright. As they descended the stairs, Kyle couldn&#39;t help but notice that his diaper was crinkling quite audibly, while Trevor&#39;s pants only had a slight rustle. Trevor strode confidently into the kitchen to get Kyle a drink, while Kyle waddled awkwardly to a chair and sat down. The cold wood of the chair shocked his thighs, but his diaper and onesie shielded his bottom from freezing. Once Trevor had poured Kyle some water, he downed the entire pint almost instantly. As he was drinking, Trevor suggested, &quot;How about you relay what happened while I was gone? We can work from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle gasped for air as he finished chugging the water, and said breathlessly &quot;Good idea.&quot; He collected himself, and started telling his husband about his misadventures with the Chronivac. &quot;I couldn&#39;t find any descriptions or how-tos, and when I clicked &#39;Accept&#39;, I just fell over. I thought there would be a confirmation screen or something. But then this weird dragon thing came in.&quot; Trevor listened intently, as the initial sight of the dragon disturbed him intensely. &quot;I thought he was going to eat me,&quot; Kyle continued, &quot;but then he picked me up, and...&quot; Kyle paused as he searched for the right words, but Trevor didn&#39;t interrupt. He waited patiently to hear it from his husband&#39;s perspective. &quot;He took care of me. He... thought I was some sort of baby, I guess, and he...&quot; Kyle blushed as he finished the thought, &quot;He dressed me like one.&quot; Kyle went on to emphasize that, besides the infantilization, Falstaff was kind and gentle to him. He talked about how he was fed, how they played together, how Falstaff changed him, and how sleepy Kyle got when he was held. Kyle&#39;s face was red from embarrassment as he went on. He had no idea in the bathroom how he would summon the courage to talk about this, but as he talked, Trevor held his hand and assured Kyle that everything was fine. It reminded Kyle of how he felt with Falstaff. With this reassurance, Kyle continued to talk about one of the most vulnerable and intimate moments he had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Kyle ended the story with dozing off in Falstaff&#39;s arms. Trevor then picked it up with his reaction upon coming home. He was startled to see his husband in the arms of a gigantic dragon, but after overcoming the initial ten seconds of paralyzing fear of the unknown, he looked at the computer and realized that the situation stemmed from the Chronivac. He spent a couple minutes exploring how Kyle had activated it, and used that to piece together an overview of the day. More than anything, Trevor was amused at how bizarre of a predicament Kyle got himself into, all because he couldn&#39;t wait to use the software. And now that they were all caught up with both perspectives, Trevor asked, &quot;Did you like your time today?&quot; He decided to not be specific about the language, just in case Kyle was still uneasy. Kyle, in the meantime, was staring off into the kitchen table as he turned the question over in his head. Saying no would be lying. Saying yes would be admitting something potentially very shameful. He looked into Trevor&#39;s eyes. There, Kyle saw concern, understanding, and a deep sense of love. Kyle was with possibly the only person he would ever reveal this to. But he had to know for sure. &quot;Would the answer change anything?&quot; Trevor scooched his chair directly in front of Kyle, and said &quot;Of course not. Don&#39;t overthink it.&quot; He held Kyle&#39;s hands, and bent forward. Kyle leaned into it, and together the two husbands closed eyes and shared a kiss. A reaffirmation. They broke it, and Trevor said &quot;I love you,&quot; with a soft smile that wiped all of Kyle&#39;s doubts away. He smiled back, saying &quot;I love you too.&quot; He looked down at their clasped hands, and summoned the will to do what he already knew he would feel no shame in. &quot;Yes, I liked my time today. I liked...&quot; He paused in trepidation, but he knew he was with Trevor. He could say the truth without fear. &quot;I liked being a baby today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s okay,&quot; said Trevor, as he stood up. He led Kyle to do the same, and Trevor embraced him. They shared the hug for a few seconds, just to let it sink in that nothing bad happened today. Then Trevor put his mouth up to Kyle&#39;s ear, and whispered, &quot;Would you like to continue being a baby?&quot; Kyle broke the embrace and was at a loss for words. His face showed confusion and uncertainty, but as he looked into Trevor&#39;s, he saw a face of excitement, and a hint of mischief. &quot;Wha?&quot; Kyle asked. He couldn&#39;t process what he just heard his husband say. &quot;Well, you liked it, so why not? Besides...&quot; Trevor said with a smirk, &quot;Your ass looks really cute that way.&quot; Kyle&#39;s face immediately turned beet red as Trevor was a little too on-the-nose. &quot;W-well, I don&#39;t know...&quot; He didn&#39;t know what he was uncertain about, Trevor just offered him practically everything he had wanted. &quot;Well then, if you&#39;re not sold yet...&quot; Trevor started unbuttoning his pants. &quot;I took a look in the bag that that Failsafe Falstaff guy left. Turns out...&quot; He lowered his trousers, revealing the tell-tale frills of a diaper. Kyle&#39;s heart skipped a beat. &quot;He left one for the road,&quot; Trevor finished with a smile that was brimming with satisfaction. He fully dropped his pants, to reveal that he was swaddled in an adult diaper, just like Kyle currently was.<br />
<br />
Kyle ogled his husband in shock and awe. The sides of his husband&#39;s diaper were cyan, and the center was covered in alpaca designs. How had Kyle not heard its rustles as they went down the stairs? How had Trevor put it on? Why? Questions spun in Kyle&#39;s head, but they were all at once silenced as Trevor closed in on him. &quot;You can have it again. We both can. We&#39;ll have a lovely time tonight. All you need to do is tell me...&quot; Trevor&#39;s eyes twinkled with mischief that made Kyle simultaneously nervous and horny. Trevor finished the question: &quot;Who&#39;s a good baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor had just asked Kyle to commit. Kyle had revealed all of these secrets to Trevor, and his husband was ready to accept it, and now he was asking Kyle to commit to the bit. Kyle began to take on a nervous smile, as he shyly admitted, &quot;I am.&quot; Saying it sent a thrill up his spine, as if he were admitting to something naughty. He was hoping that was enough, but Trevor wasn&#39;t satisfied. &quot;Who is?&quot; he repeated. Kyle groaned and his grin grew wider, as he said louder, &quot;I&#39;m a good baby.&quot; It drove him nuts. He wanted Trevor, here and now, but Trevor was making him confess his status. But Trevor still wouldn&#39;t budge. This time, he held up a blue pacifier. The pacifier that had been dangling off of Kyle&#39;s onesie ever since he got out of the bathroom. The binky he had forgotten about while he was talking with Trevor. Kyle&#39;s binky. Trevor popped his binky into his mouth. Kyle sucked it with all of the instincts he had picked up today, and grinned in embarrassment. And finally, Trevor said, &quot;One more time.&quot; Trevor wouldn&#39;t be satisfied until Kyle completely committed. He had to fully commit to being... But that wasn&#39;t a problem, because that&#39;s what he was. &quot;I&#39;m a guwd baybee,&quot; Kyle slurred through his binky. And Trevor fell upon Kyle, kissing him soundly on his pacifier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good baby,&quot; Trevor said. He beamed with rascally delight, and Kyle couldn&#39;t help but smile back bashfully. He was a good baby, and Trevor loved it. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Trevor said, as he pushed Kyle to the stairs. Kyle bounded up the stairs in his onesie, skipping one stair at a time. Trevor followed, removing his shirt as he ascended the stairs at a slower pace. Kyle jumped onto their bed, shucking off the changing pad that they didn&#39;t need right now. He sat up on the bed, just in time for Trevor to come in shirtless, his alpaca diaper being the only garment he had on, and giving his gait a waddle similar to Kyle&#39;s. He climbed onto the bed and crawled face-to-face with Kyle, who could only smile stupidly as he wondered if this were all some wonderful dream he might wake up from.<br />
<br />
Out of nowhere, Trevor produced some blue boots and mittens, and brought them up to Kyle&#39;s face. He sucked his binky hard, suddenly remembering that he had even more baby clothes. &quot;Mah gwubs and boots,&quot; he murmured. Trevor helped him get them off, but now all Kyle wanted was for him to put them back on. &quot;That&#39;s right, yours,&quot; Trevor replied. He was quite satisfied that his baby was so cooperative, and the erection in his own diaper only hardened. He slid on Kyle&#39;s booties, and then his mittens, being sure to retie them so as to not slip off. Once Kyle was all redressed and examining his trapped hands, Trevor leaned forward and kissed Kyle&#39;s binky. Kyle could only suck on it, but that&#39;s what he was supposed to do, and so he did.<br />
<br />
Trevor moved forward, toppling Kyle from his sitting position to lying down. Trevor looked down at his baby, who sucked his pacifier as he looked up in return. &quot;God, you&#39;re so cute,&quot; Trevor murmured huskily. Kyle grinned in satisfaction as his husband repositioned his torso. He wasn&#39;t sure what Trevor had in mind, as Kyle was wearing his diapie, and didn&#39;t want to take it off. The most they could do was... Kyle started picking up on the idea, and thrust his diapie upward. Trevor mimicked he motion, and thrust his own diaper downward. Their groins met, and the two grown men started frotting.<br />
<br />
As Trevor humped him from above, Kyle took a look at the man who loved him. Trevor looked like he was having the time of his life. He looked so confident, so happy, and so... in charge. Sexy. He pursed his lips around his binky, and suckled hard. In a passing thought, he wished he could suck something else. Trevor looked down at him, and saw the neediest look on Kyle&#39;s pacified face. Trevor was driving his husband wild, and he loved it. &quot;You&#39;re so fucking cute as a baby,&quot; he groaned. He took Kyle&#39;s mittened hands in his own, bent down, and with his teeth carefully grasping the ring, he pulled out Kyle&#39;s binky. He let it dangle for a second as he took in Kyle&#39;s face. His lips were still pursed in an O, and slightly pulsing, as if he were still sucking, or asking for his binky back. Kyle even gave a slight groan, as if in protest. &quot;He&#39;s so needy,&quot; Trevor thought to himself gleefully. Trevor let the binky fall, and occupied Kyle&#39;s needy lips with his own. They kissed passionately, continuing to thrust into each other.<br />
<br />
Trevor presently parted, and the two men smiled at each other. But Trevor was nearing climax, and he wanted to remind Kyle of his place. Trevor quickly found the baby&#39;s binky and replaced it. &quot;Now Kyle, who&#39;s a good baby?&quot; he asked, as his thrusts became harder and slower. Kyle giggled as he said, &quot;I&#39;m a goo&#39; bahbee.&quot; &quot;Yes you are,&quot; Trevor teased between pants, &quot;Now say it again.&quot; Kyle repeated, louder and clearer: &quot;I&#39;m a guhd baybee!&quot; Trevor shouted, &quot;Yes!&quot; and thrust his diaper on last time into his husband. He climaxed into the alpaca diaper, as Kyle continued to thrust upward. He looked his baby in the eyes as he came, as he suckled his binky and continued thrusting. Suddenly, Kyle gave one solid thrust of his diapie and held it, as he closed his eyes and loudly said, &quot;I&#39;m a guhd baybee!&quot; finally admitting it of his own volition. As Trevor&#39;s ejaculation died down, he felt Kyle give the telltale pulses of his groin, as he also came in his diapie. They held their position for ten whole seconds as they rode the wave of ecstasy together, hands clasped.<br />
<br />
As their climaxes died down, Kyle collapsed onto the bed under Trevor, who fell to the side to prevent crushing his husband. He still clasped Kyle&#39;s hand through his mitten, as they panted from their exertion. Trevor quickly said, &quot;That was fucking incredible.&quot; A couple more breaths, and he said, with his previous patronization replaced with awe and admiration, &quot;You&#39;re such a good baby.&quot; Kyle recognized it as a compliment, and he said, &quot;Fank yoo.&quot; And he meant it. Trevor gave him everything he was looking for, and then some. &quot;Fank you, fo&#39; eb&#39;wyfing.&quot; Trevor turned to look at him, and he found Kyle smiling gratefully and wearily through his binky. Trevor turned onto his side, Kyle mirroring, and he said, &quot;No problem, babe.&quot; He caressed Kyle&#39;s stubbly cheek, as he touched their foreheads. &quot;Love you, Kyle,&quot; he said dreamily. &quot;Wub you too, Twebow.&quot; They cuddled each other as they basked in their afterglow, reveling in their shared trust for each other.</p>
