<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"No, I can't see you. Where are you?" Derek said, frightened. He took a step closer to the bed.
<P>"STOP! Don't come any closer!"
<P>"What is it? Where are you?"
<P>"I'm right at your feet! I'm barely an inch tall and you're about to step on me!"
<P>Derek jumped back, looking at the floor. He tried to pinpoint a foreign speck among the white carpet. "I can't find you," he said in a panicked voice. Then he heard her laughing. He looked up and saw her emerging from behind her closet door.
<P>"Sorry," she said in between laughs. "I just had to do it."
<P>Derek let out a relieved sigh. While Sonya calmed down and caught her breath, he noticed what she was wearing. Her studded collar was on, as expected. Its black leash extended down to her knees. The rest of her wardrobe seemed to have been chosen to match. She was wearing a tight black shell top which strapped around her shoulders and exposed her entire belly, as well as a hint of her cleavage. Her wrists had bracelets that were black and studded just like her collar. She also wore a black skirt that went down to just above her knees. It had several thin, embedded horizontal stripes and a big silver belt buckle. Her feet were in one-inch platform shoes with four separate buckles. The tops of the boots were tightly buckled a short distance below her knees.
<P>"You're staring," Sonya said playfully. She walked up to Derek and he realized for the first time that he had to look down to make eye contact.
<P>"And you're shrinking," he replied.
<P>"It's unreal, isn't it?" she twirled around the room. "Everything looks so big! I'm going to shrink one inch every ten minutes. I put the collar on an hour ago." She walked closer to Derek. "I wanted to make sure I was already shorter than you when you got here." She pulled in even closer and hugged him. They'd hugged countless times before, but it felt so strange to feel her arms lower than they were supposed to be, and her head lower than his. He returned the hug, feeling her smaller body clinging tightly to his. Then she raised his head to his and they kissed. When they broke away, she craned her neck to whisper in his ear "Tonight is going to be special." He couldn't agree more.
<P>* * * * *
<P>As they drove to the party, Sonya explained her risque outfit. She had thrown on a sparkling silver waist-length top that she could wear while she was at the party. It was open all down the front, which offered a good view of her special clothing.
<P>"The collar is designed to shrink with the wearer," she began. "And this black shell-top is designed for women with breast alteration spells. It'll shrink--or grow--to fit my current size. The skirt's another matter. It's got a belt, obviously, but it also has tear-off sections so that it won't get too long on me." Derek surmised that must be what those horizontal bands were for. She continued, "The platforms have adjustable belts, too, but they also have adjustable height. I just have to click my heels three times while saying how tall I want them to be, and the platforms will change to suit."
<P>"Okay, but don't go all 'Wizard of Oz' on me," Derek snickered. "What about the bracelets? Are they like the collar?"
<P>"No, they're just bracelets," Sonya answered. "I've had 'em for years and decided to wear them when I realized they matched the collar."
<P>"I can't believe you're doing this," Derek said as he parked the car on the street close to Kevin's house. There were already several cars lining the road. "It's not too late to reverse this...is it?"
<P>"Yes, it's reversible," Sonya said disappointedly. "Once the collar is off, I'll grow back to my old height as fast as I'm shrinking now. But don't think I'm just doing this for you. This whole smaller-and-smaller thing is really fun."
<P>"I'll try it sometime." Derek turned off the engine and turned to his girlfriend. "You ready to party?" They both got out of the car stepped onto the sidewalk. Derek raised his eyebrows when he realized that she had already shrunk over an inch since they had left her house, and tried to convince himself to get used to it.
<P>Sonya held up her leash and he took it, threading the loop through his left hand. She looked down at her platforms and started slapping them together, saying "Eight inches." She slowly grew taller...or, actually, the boots did. Derek watched as the platform heels extended to a lofty eight inches just as they had been instructed. When he looked back at Sonya, she was at her normal six-foot-three height. She was giving him a coy grin and he returned it. Together they walked up the sidewalk to Kevin's house.</p>
