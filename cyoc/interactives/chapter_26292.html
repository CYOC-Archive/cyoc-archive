<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Lisa and Vix stared at each other, bewildered at their coincidental remark.<br />
<br />
“I’m listening,” Vix said being the first to recover. Although, she wasn’t very eager to know what Lisa had in mind.<br />
<br />
Lisa wasted no time in voicing her thoughts. “We’ll go to Robert’s Forest, transform and rescue Sharon before the deadline. We’ll surround him and make a distraction to draw Dan’s attention away. We’ll then move in and take Sharon before he has a chance to return. ” Although Lisa wanted Dan dead, she knew that this plan would be better for the others to swallow.<br />
<br />
“I assume ‘we’ as in you all. Never once did you include me in this simple minded plan.”<br />
<br />
“Dear, you’ve done enough giving all the information we need. Bringing you along will only slow us down and Wendy can’t transform until after the next full moon,” Lisa said.<br />
<br />
“Oh really. Me slowing you down? And because you think your lycanthropy gives you any more advantage over trained federal agents that you can go about doing your own rescue missions,” Vix sarcastically rebuked. <br />
<br />
“But it does Vix,” Lisa said seductively. “We can run faster, see in the dark better, track easier, all without having to rely on technology that would compensate for your shortcomings.”<br />
<br />
“It is technology that allowed us to track down Dan’s location. It is technology that created night-vision goggles and guns with silver bullets, of which Dan has. So unless you’re faster than a bullet or invisible, you’re not much different than me.” Vix’s rebuttal had left her without much patience. “I’m not going to be tossed aside while Dan is still on the loose, this maybe the only chance I’ll have on him before he strikes again.”<br />
<br />
“Then let’s hear your little plan dear,” Lisa smiled.<br />
<br />
Vix started telling everyone in detail of how she will position the Ranger team, Wendy, and herself around the site where they are to meet Dan. Once Dan arrives at the rendezvous point, Wendy will assist Vix in spotting Dan from a different position. Vix will be the sniper and once Dan is exposed, she will take the shot.<br />
<br />
“Apparently your plan doesn’t include us, either.” Lisa smirked after hearing Vix’s monologue.<br />
<br />
“You’re fortunate that I even told this much to you. Dan has killed an officer. This is a federal matter and I will treat it as so.”<br />
<br />
“He also kidnapped Sharon and shot Wendy, several times I may add.” Lisa briefly smiled at Wendy for both being smart and lucky. “It is my responsibility for bringing Sharon back safe.” Lisa thought for a moment and corrected herself. “All of our responsibility. We share a special bond dear; it gives us strength when we need it. We owe Sharon our best for allowing herself to be a part of that bond.” <br />
<br />
Lisa’s words had an impact on Vix which caused her to momentarily second guess herself. “You forget that Dan is a federal agent. He has the training and will KILL you without hesitation.” Vix tried a more personal approach. “Think of your families, how will they react to found out that their mother is dead?” Vix stopped. The statement had unnerved several coven members, Vix included. The memories of her own loss flooded her, leaving her speechless.<br />
<br />
Lisa detected her angst and saw that Vix was grief stricken by her own comments. Clandestinely, Lisa started piecing Vix’s past. “What do we say to Sharon’s daughter, Katie, if we did nothing? She would never forgive us and we wouldn’t forgive ourselves if anything happened. Dear, you must understand how difficult it is for all of us.” Vix shifted uncomfortably. “Imagine losing someone you loved and knowing that something could have been done to prevent it.”<br />
<br />
“I am,” Vix replied, staring at Lisa. Wendy noticed an abrupt change in Vix. It was in her eyes. No longer was it the calm, cool like of an agent that she was working with; it was same look when Dan shot her, the look of a burning hatred. Wendy stepped between the two women, facing Vix.<br />
<br />
“Let’s work on this together,” Wendy urgently said. The hatred in Vix’s eyes fades and was replaced with confusion. “Vix, can’t we work something out here?”<br />
<br />
It was apparent that Lisa’s pack was going to go with their plan with or without Vix’s wish. The most logical step would be to agree on plan so that everyone could be involved, thought Vix through her clouded mind. I almost lost myself. This can’t happen again, I have to keep my emotions in check. Vix returned to her normal composed state. “You’re right, Wendy. We do need to work together on this.”<br />
<br />
Wendy did an about-face. “Lisa?”<br />
<br />
Lisa knew she triggered a nerve in Vix. Her mother most of died prematurely, and from her reactions she blames me for reminding her. Or was it, she blamed lycanthropes in general? There were so many possibilities. One thing Lisa did know, she couldn’t trust Vix with Sharon’s safety. “I’m willing to negotiate, to an extent,” Lisa said wryly.<br />
<br />
“That’s a good start,” Wendy said relieved. She was the only middle ground from both Lisa and Vix. They both trusted her more than they do of each other.<br />
<br />
At the table, Lisa and Vix predominately spoke while Wendy cuts in every so often to quell disagreements. Debra, Solange, and Anaya also added in a few suggestions as well as having Brenda and Ebony offering ideas on conflicting points. A plan of all minds unfolded.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Vix quickly agreed on acting before the appointed time Dan had set up. Lisa and her pack will form an immediate perimeter around Dan’s position while the Ranger team forms an outer perimeter to prevent his escape. While Lisa sets up her pack into position, Wendy will create a distraction. Vix wanted to be the one to distract Dan, but Lisa didn’t want to hear any of it. Wendy was the only individual they cooperated on doing the job.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that Dan is currently in a heavily wooded area and not a clearing like the rendezvous point, a long distance shot will be next to impossible. A booby trap could do it, she pondered. But, it was clear to Vix that Lisa didn’t want her near the action since that proposal was also shot down. Much to her disappointment, Vix agreed in staying away from the forefront on the condition that Wendy will file a complete report after this is done. The rest of the plan will rely on intuition and improvisation.<br />
<br />
After plan was made, they all exited office. Lisa, Debra, and Wendy were going to drive together with the rest of the pack to Robert’s Forest. Vix will drive alone to brief the Rangers and meet them later in the park. Vix had given Wendy a GPS tracking device worn on the wrist so she could find them. After a very short goodbye, they went about their separate ways.</p>
