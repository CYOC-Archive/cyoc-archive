<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a few minutes for the reality to truly sink in. These were, after all, 13-year-olds, regardless of how they now 
<br>
 looked. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon knew he had to do something to reverse what had happened to Heather - but what? 
<br>

<br>
 He looked to Ed, still tangled in his teen-size clothing and just reached down and scooped up his now 6-year-old firend 
<br>
 and, one hand under Ed's butt, carried him to the couch. 
<br>

<br>
 Ed was still in a slight state of shock. He realized he was clad now in only an oversized shirt, and that his (to him) HUGE 
<br>
 buddy, Simon, was carrying him like a little kid, but stil, almost instinctively, wrapped his little arms around Simon's 
<br>
 neck when he was picked up. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon sat on the couch, then popped right back up, wincing (he had sat on his tail!) and plopped Ed down onto the sofa's 
<br>
 soft cushion. Ed's pudgy legs stuck straight out, feet just barely poking past the edge of the cushion. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon, a hand on each hip, skooched his jeans down until they hung low on his pelvis, then reached around and freed his new 
<br>
 appendage from the elastic of his briefs. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ahh, that's better,&quot; he said, testing how the tail moved by slightly shaking his hips back and forth. Quickly, he realized 
<br>
 he kind of liked the new addition, and made a mental note to grow a tail again in case he lost this one. 
<br>

<br>
 Holding the furry tip up with one hand, he carefully sat next to Ed, brushing the long locks hanging over one eye aside. He 
<br>
 grabbed the youngster's shoulders and shook him slightly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Look, Ed, I know you're still YOU. We've got to fix what happened to Heather or we're gonna catch holy hell! Ed! Bud! Stay 
<br>
 with me here!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 The insistent sound of Simon's voice was something Ed could finally focus on. He looked up - way up - into Simon's frantic 
<br>
 eyes and nodded. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;OK, I'm going to go over and try to undo this. You stay put here. Don't move. Don't touch anything. OK?&quot; Simon asked. 
<br>

<br>
 Ed nodded again, now aware that his vision was becoming blurry from incipient tears as the full realization of Heather's 
<br>
 fate hit him. Ed sniffed loudly and ran one drooping sleeve across his nose. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon didn't know how much time, if any, he might have to bring Heather back. He went to the computer desk and grabbed the 
<br>
 manual (his tail, sticking out from beneath his shirt, wagged as he walked) and turned to the index, looked for a chapter 
<br>
 on 'restore' or 'undo.' Still standing, tail slowly swishing in a horizontal arc, he moved a finger across the page he'd 
<br>
 been directed to by the index. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Got it!&quot; he shouted. &quot;There's a universal undo command. That should fix up Heather and then we can restore you and me, 
<br>
 too.&quot; Simon's tail was bobbing back and forth more vigorously now. 
<br>

<br>
 Carefully, he sat in the desk chair, reaching around behind to position his tail so that it stuck out between the seat and 
<br>
 the chair's ergonomically-designed backrest. Again he had to brush his very long hair aside and hook it behind his ears. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon brought up Heather's stats on the screen and entered the restore command. Before his index finger had lifted from the 
<br>
 Enter key he stared at the still-darker spot on the carpet where Heather had been. 
<br>

<br>
 5 seconds. 
<br>

<br>
 10 seconds. 
<br>

<br>
 15. 
<br>

<br>
 Nothing. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Damn. Damn, damn damn!&quot; Simnon shouted, pounding a fist onto the desktop. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, Thimon?&quot; Ed lisped. &quot;Thimon? Maybe it'th becauth Hea-thuh wan it thwough the thee-D pwogwam? Maybe we have to all be 
<br>
 togethuh and, wike, thtand wheaw we wuh befaw?&quot; Another loud sniffle followed the boy's comment. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Huh? What?&quot; Simon answered, distracted. &quot;Of course! It ran through a buffer, she said, and then all three of us got zapped 
<br>
 at once!&quot; With that he went to the couch and picked Ed up by his underarms, high into the air. &quot;Ed, you're a freakin' 
<br>
 genius! Heather's hacking must've overridden a safety feature. I'm sure when I first looked at the manual that it said you 
<br>
 couldn't go back that far!&quot; Ed grinned broadly, showing a gap where one tooth was missing. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Put me down!&quot; he insisted, wary of how long a way it appeared to be to the floor. &quot;I thtand wight wheaw I wath befaw. You 
<br>
 can pwobabwy weach the keybawd by bending ovuh - hey, I bet that tayuw of yaws can weach! Wet'th thee!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ed grabbed Simon's tail, pulled and, as if casting a fishing rod, dropped the tip in a long arch towards the desk. &quot;Hey, 
<br>
 careful. That's attached, you know!&quot; Simon protested, but Ed was right. Simon's tail could just reach the keyboard. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;All right, then. You stand over here,&quot; Simon pointed to the spot, &quot;and I'll stand here and hit the key with my tail. Now 
<br>
 we have to make sure we know which program Heather integrated into the game. I remmber whe said something about music ....&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Wike a jukeboxth!&quot; Ed offered. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;That was it - she said it would use a random access and play program. I know which one that is!&quot; Simon exulted. &quot;So we 
<br>
 have to set up the game with all three of us onscreen, access the CD and use the undo command three times to put the 'undo' 
<br>
 into the buffer - I hope!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ed, raealizing his present size effectively made him useless for this part of the task, was studying parts of himself at 
<br>
 their new dimension. He glanced over to Heather's 'position' and prompted, &quot;Huwwy, Thimon! The thpot'th dwying up!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Simon brushed hair aside yet again. Although it wasn't particularly hot in the room, he was sweating. A trickle of moisture 
<br>
 ran down his back, splitting into two rivulets as it hit the base of his tail. &quot;That -- ought -- to -- do -- it!&quot; he said 
<br>
 and stepped back to his designated spot. &quot;Cross your fingers, bud,&quot; he told little Ed. 
<br>

<br>
 Grabbing his tail, Simon, looking over one shoulder, guided it towards the desk, until the furry tip hovered just over the 
<br>
 keyboard. &quot;3 -- 2 -- 1 -- NOW!&quot; he shouted. 
<br>

<br>
 The soft sound of the CD whirring up was all they heard. 
<br>

<br>
 It wasn't like the previous time. Simon and Ed would later swear they had blacked out and couldn't recall anything. All 
<br>
 they knoew was that the whir of the computer was replaced by a clunking and then grinding sound, and, the next thing they 
<br>
 knew, thew change had occurred. 
<br>

<br>
 Ed, 13 again, was naked from the waist down. 
<br>

<br>
 Simon, now tailless and with his original hairstyle, was strill as tall as he'd be at 16, just as he's been before the 
<br>
 three of them had tried the game. 
<br>

<br>
 And Heather. Heather had not so much grown up as just popped back in, lying on one side on the carpet. She was 12 again. 
<br>
 She was also naked as a jaybird and covered from head to toes with a film of something moist and a bit sticky. It took 
<br>
 several minuted for the boys to wake her. They tried to wipe off as much of the substance as they could, but were too 
<br>
 embarrassed to accomplish much. 
<br>

<br>
 No matter what the boys said, she insisted that nothing had happened except that, somehow, &quot;you two perverts&quot; had conspired 
<br>
 to undress her. 
<br>

<br>
 The serious insistence of both boys finally calmed her down and she began to accept their story, but a veneer of doubt 
<br>
 still kept her in a foul mood. She was upset at the ';yucky' stuff on her skin, too, and neither boy had an explanation for 
<br>
 that - Heather coudn't even begin to guess why they'd done that to her and slowly, slowly acquiesced to their denials and 
<br>
 apologies. 
<br>

<br>
 Ed, heedless of his own half-clothed state, handed Heather her clothies and turned away, pulling Simon's arm to signal him 
<br>
 to do the same. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Don't you wiggle your ass at me, smarty-pants Simon. I'm still mad at you, you know,&quot; Heather said as she dressed. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What?&quot; Simon thought. &quot;Oh,&quot; he smirked. Unconsciously, he had been trying to move his tail, which was now no more. Simon 
<br>
 sighed. He really missed it. In just a short time, it had seemed to be so natural a part of him!</p>
