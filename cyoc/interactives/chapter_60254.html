<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David began to feel a tingling in his legs. It started at the point along the middle where he was holding them together. He could sense <br />
the tingling spreading outwards to take in all of his legs and he knew that the transformation proper was beginning. He ran his hands <br />
over the blue/goldness of the tail and felt the muscles underneath shift slightly. His fingers explored the length of the tail as far as he <br />
could reach and he could feel the changes in his legs. No longer could he separate his legs, nor could he identify his feet as they had <br />
started to flatten out into the beautiful, graceful tailfin he had always dreamed of having. As his legs continued to transform the point at <br />
which the tail met his torso changed as well. The scales that had previously ended in a defined straight line across his lower stomach <br />
now began to meld with his human flesh. The distinction between the scales and the flesh became blurred and scales began to grow up <br />
his torso in the centre towards his naval. They formed a pointed v up towards his naval replacing his treasure trail with blue green and <br />
gold scales. At the same time David could feel his human body changing as well. He had always been a fit young guy but in order to be <br />
a true merman he needed a stronger build. His muscles grew and became more defined, the v of his lower abdomen more pronounced <br />
and his abs were sensational. His pecs rounded out and his shoulders and upper arms filled out to provide a body that any swimmer <br />
would have died for. <br />
<br />
Slowly the transformation slowed and David could begin to finally admire his new form. He was a magnificent specimen. The upper half <br />
would have made any man jealous and the new lithe muscular tail with broad beautiful tailfin made David into what he thought was a <br />
near perfect specimen of a merman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like you're about finished&quot; said a voice behind David. He turned and saw that the voice belonged to a beautiful merman <br />
who had been watching the transformation from a rock in the bay. &quot;Sorry I didn't mean to startle you&quot; said the merman &quot;Just admiring <br />
the view&quot;.  The merman lounged on the rock propping himself on his right elbow. His long tail rested on the rock and the ends of the fins <br />
splashed playfully in the water. His tail was a stunning red and orange colour shot through with gold and bright yellow. His human top <br />
half was more impressive than David considered his own new form to be and his eyes were a deep golden colour which set of his blond <br />
hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's ok&quot; stammered David &quot;I just didn't realize anyone else was here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was attracted to the magic of the incantation&quot; he said &quot;and wanted to meet the newcomer. And I must say that I'm glad I did&quot; the <br />
merman looked approvingly at David. &quot;You've done a good job with the transformation. You must have had a very clear idea of what <br />
you wanted to look like&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've always wanted to be like this&quot; said David &quot;Even from a young age. So I guess you could say that. I'm David by the way. What do I <br />
call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Argent&quot; said the merman. &quot;Now that you've joined our species I will be your guide and mentor. Each newcomer needs <br />
someone to take them under their fin and I will admit this will be my pleasure.&quot; David could feel himself blushing<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on then&quot; said Argent lifting himself into a sitting position on the rock and looking expectantly at David. &quot;Try out your new <br />
equipment and swim over here. Let's get a better look at you&quot; he made a come over here guesture with his hand. <br />
<br />
David wiggled his new tail, realizing that this was the first time and wanting to make sure it looked graceful and effortless as much as he <br />
could. He pushed away from the dock and began to swish his tail through the water. He was amazed at how natural it felt. The water <br />
flowed over his muscular tail and he could feel the eddies and swirls created by his fins as he thrust forwards. He headed put towards <br />
the rock and slowed as he approached it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, well done. Very impressive&quot; Argent was clapping as David approached. &quot;Not all newcomers are as deft as you made that <br />
appear&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you kind sir&quot; David mock bowed and rolled his arms in suitable grandiose bowing gestures. &quot;It felt really natural and easy&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your long held desires helped make it that way&quot; explained Argent. &quot;You were obviously a merman trapped in a human body&quot; he <br />
laughed. As he did so David noticed that Argent had more obvious scales across his chest and some on his face. They hadn't been <br />
noticeable from a distance. Far from detracting from his beauty, David thought that they only served to make him look even sexier. He <br />
also noticed that Argent had smaller fins running along the back of his arms down to his wrists. David looked at his own bare human <br />
flesh and wished he had more of these scales and accents to add to his transformation. <br />
<br />
Seeing the look in Davids eyes Argent said &quot;Don't worry. You're not fully finished yet. You'll get all of this just as soon as we've finished <br />
the ritual. &quot;<br />
<br />
Davids eyes lit up. &quot;You mean I'll get all the other scales and those arm fins too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; nodded Argent smiling indulgently. &quot;In your haste you obviously didn't read right to the end of the spell. You need to form a <br />
bond with another mercreature to finalize the transformation. And I would be honored if you would consider bonding with me.&quot; Argent <br />
bowed his head low. At that point David noticed the twin fins running down his shoulder blades. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of....... of course&quot; stammered David &quot;I would love that. What do we have to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Argent took Davids head in his firm strong hand and pulled Davids face towards his own. As he did so he slipped off the rock to join <br />
David in the water. Their faces met and Argent pressed his lips against Davids in a strong passionate kiss, his tongue reaching into <br />
Davis welcoming mouth. Davids arms wrapped around Argents strong back as Argents red tail began to wrap around Davids blue one. <br />
As they rubbed their crotches together both of them becoming aroused, their cocks slipped out of their slits and met, rubbing against <br />
one another. <br />
<br />
David was in ecstasy. This was better than he had ever hoped for. Not only had he become a merman but he was going to be bonded <br />
to a gorgeous merman to boot. Heaven. <br />
<br />
As they rolled and played in the surf, small blue/gold scales began to appear across Davids chest in similar places and in similar places <br />
to Argents. His arms developed fins and he could feel the fins grow on his back out of his shoulder blades. <br />
<br />
He was having the time of his life but he knew this was only the beginning of his adventures.....</p>
