<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin leaned her head on John&#39;s shoulder as they strolled away from the pub, arm in arm. &quot;Hey,&quot; she said with a slight slurring of her speech, &quot;ever gone skinny-dipping with a mermaid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never on a first date,&quot; said John.<br />
<br />
Erin stopped moving and stood on the sidewalk. John also stopped to look at her; she was gazing at him with a questioning look on her face, as if she were trying to decide something. A car rolled slowly past them through the neighborhood, and somewhere in the distance, a cat screeched. There were some kids on the from porch of an apartment building across the street blasting loud music and taking turns dancing.<br />
<br />
Finally, Erin said, &quot;Take me home. I feel like sitting in for the rest of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot;<br />
<br />
A short while later, they had covered the remaining distance to Erin&#39;s place, and they were now standing on her front porch. <br />
<br />
Is she going to invite me back in? wondered John. <br />
<br />
I hope doesn&#39;t run away like all the others, thought Erin.<br />
<br />
They just stood there, a little nervous, a little awkward, each looking at the other and then trying to look anywhere else, skittish about meeting each other&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
At last, the liquid courage fueling Erin right now broke down her barriers, and she said, &quot;Look, John, I&#39;m gonna go for broke here. I like you, so don&#39;t you dare kiss me goodnight—not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
John responded by taking Erin&#39;s arms in his hands, pulling her close, and kissing her. (This is exactly what I told him *not* to do! thought Erin in annoyance and disappointment. Go figure . . .) But John paused for breath and said, &quot;That wasn&#39;t good-night. It was . . . welcome home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin searched John&#39;s face, looking for any sign that he was being insincere, or messing with her. She found none; and so she grabbed him and kissed him back, and they didn&#39;t part again until they were stumbling through her front door and onto her couch.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, John was on his back, and Erin was on top of him (which was a bit rough on John, because her tail weighed *a lot*). She directed his hands to her back and to the tie-clasp that held her bra on, and said, &quot;Get these shells off me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not planning on getting up for a while?&quot; John quipped.<br />
<br />
Erin grinned, shook her head (with her face still so close to John&#39;s that her nose brushed his and her hair tickled his cheeks), and said, &quot;Not on your life, mister.&quot; They resumed kissing, now with the mermaid completely naked on top of him—though she made to move to undress John, which gave him pause. Maybe, he thought to himself haltingly, she wasn&#39;t kidding earlier and being naked is just a comfort thing for mermaids, and she doesn&#39;t really expect us to go any further than this tonight.<br />
<br />
Erin, too, was a little hesitant, and after their kissing started to get a little heavier and she was feeling a pleasant numbness in her lips from the all-too-infrequent exercise they were receiving, she suggested that they take it a little slower and maybe watch a show. &quot;After all, we&#39;ve got all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
John agreed, and so they threw on Netflix and amused themselves with a truly god-awful, low-budget &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; move they found that eventually had Erin howling with laughter. &quot;All that nonsense about a moon-eyed mermaid princess longing for a human soul is just bullshit!&quot; she said at one point. &quot;If a mermaid wants a pretty land-boy, it&#39;s definitely not so she can say her prayers and go to heaven!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I take it you don&#39;t live for centuries and then turn to sea-foam,&quot; said John with a chuckle as the movie wound down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope; we&#39;re pretty much just like humans there. Maybe a little bit longer-lived, but not much more than a hundred, maybe a hundred and twenty years, tops.&quot;<br />
<br />
John pointed at Erin&#39;s tail, which was now flopping from excitement and mirth so that her fin was beating on the floor, and she barely noticed. &quot;And I take it you can&#39;t just get a potion from a sea-witch if you want to grow legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh,&quot; said Erin, &quot;I wondered if you&#39;d bring *that* up. Legs are a very touchy subject for mermaids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don&#39;t wan&#39;t to pry, if it&#39;s something—sensitive, or offensive—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; said Erin. &quot;It&#39;s just that . . . human guys always seem to have that expectation, you know? &#39;Oh, I don&#39;t want to touch your slimy scales, can&#39;t you just get legs by drying off?&#39; and &#39;Where do you hide your girly-bits?&#39; God, I hate that. It&#39;s just so . . . objectifying!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never—&quot; stammered John. &quot;I&#39;m just curious about the magic stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin&#39;s face softened and she touched John&#39;s cheek. &quot;Yeah, I know. It&#39;s my hang-up, not yours. I just—I&#39;ve had some bad relationships, okay? Suffice it to say, there are means for a mermaid to get legs, but they all flat-out suck. Transformation magic is super-dangerous. It hurts like a son of a bitch, it can straight-up kill you if you make the slightest little mistake, and if you turn yourself into a human, guess what happens? You start to *think* you&#39;re a human, until you forget that you were ever mer, and then it&#39;s fucking permanent. I don&#39;t want that to ever happen to me, so I&#39;m *not* gonna give up my tail just for some *guy*, no sir, not ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d never ask you to,&quot; said John. &quot;I like your tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin was surprised. &quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s pretty,&quot; said John. &quot;It&#39;s . . . really sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well . . . yeah. I mean, come on. I&#39;m a guy. Guys think mermaids are hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys like the *idea* of a mermaid. But in my experience, even the nicest ones get grossed out change their tune once the fins are within arm&#39;s reach.&quot; She lifted up her tali and waved her flukes right in front of John&#39;s face; he didn&#39;t flinch.<br />
<br />
Instead, he ran a hand from her fin and onto her scales, gently, up the length of her tail, going against the scales&#39; grain but careful not to lift any of them up. Erin closed her eyes and enjoyed the feeling. John said, &quot;Have you heard me complain yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but . . .&quot; Erin opened her eyes again and looked at John seriously. &quot;You&#39;re not, like, *too* into mermaids, are you? Like, is the tail some kind of fetish-thing for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked down at Erin&#39;s tail again. &quot;Well, I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t have a *bit* of a thing for mermaids. Maybe that&#39;s part of why I was so calm when I first saw you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin looked away, not wanting to meet John&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
John saw this and tried to explain, &quot;It&#39;s like . . . if you&#39;ve read my books, then you know that one of the series&#39; main recurring characters is a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; said Erin. &quot; &#39;Sirena Delamare, mermaid private detective&#39;! How could I ever forget her? &#39;A real fishy femme fatale!&#39; &quot; she quoted with a hollow laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, I put her in the book because I think mermaids are cool,&quot; said John. &quot;But it&#39;s the same thing I think about all the other &#39;mythical&#39; types in my stories. There are elves because I like elves, gnomes because I like gnomes, and it&#39;s the same for the centaur ranch-hand and the djinni sit-com actress and the wizard IT nerd—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, I get it,&quot; said Erin. &quot;You&#39;re not an obsessive, just a fan. I guess that&#39;s cool—so long as you don&#39;t have, like, a computer at home full of creepy CGI mermaid porn, or something.&quot; She glared. &quot;You don&#39;t, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
John laughed and put a hand over his chest. &quot;Cross my heart, I don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well all right then. I just want to be sure that it&#39;s *me* you&#39;re interested in, and not my tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it be so terrible if liked both?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin smiled warmly. &quot;I guess not. It&#39;s better than if you liked my girl-half but couldn&#39;t stand touching my fish-half.&quot; She gestured at her tail and said, &quot;After all, this isn&#39;t just a part of me, it&#39;s who I am. When you get right down to it . . . I guess all I&#39;ve really been looking for is a guy who&#39;s into both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can be that guy,&quot; said John. &quot;I mean, I like *all* of you, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d still like who you are with or without your tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin&#39;s heart soared. &quot;Okay, then . . . before we go any further, I suppose I&#39;d better talk to you about sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, here we go, thought John. He couldn&#39;t keep the worry off of his face when he echoed, &quot;Sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded, gravely. &quot;For mermaids, sex is . . .&quot;</p>
