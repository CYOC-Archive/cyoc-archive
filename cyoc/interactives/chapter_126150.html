<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking down at Buck, Ty grinned and patted his passed out friend&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now. We can&#39;t have that can we?&quot; As he said the words, Ty willed Buck back to the land of the waking.<br />
<br />
With a gasp Buck staggered upright looking around wildly and flailing on his four legs as he readjusted to consciousness. Finally his sight landed on Ty, before he glanced down at the ground, seeing the think white gooey splatters of their little romp. He turned his head and glanced at his comically limp and long member, slowly retreating back into its sheath and shrinking by the second.<br />
<br />
Looking back up at Ty, he said the only thing that came to mind. &quot;Oh. Oops?&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked at each other for a moment before bursting out laughing. After a moment, they calmed, and sat down on the forest floor after Ty willed the puddles away.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I get this feeling you&#39;ve wanted to do that to somebody or some animal for a long time?&quot; Buck took a sidelong glance at Ty and nudged him playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; Ty smiled back. &quot;You kissed me first. It&#39;s your fault I turned gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it wasn&#39;t gay.&quot; Buck snorted, relishing the warmth and satisfaction running over his furred body, especially as Ty put his arm around his neck and leaned against him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t think it is.&quot; Ty gently nuzzled Buck&#39;s face to his cheek and smiled. &quot;Do you only like boys now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Buck honestly paused in thought and considered this deep question. &quot;No... no, I definitely still like lean shapely does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still like blondes with big boobs.&quot; Ty shrugged. &quot;So I guess we aren&#39;t gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You keep telling yourself that, deer tamer.&quot; Buck laughed hysterically, and stood up to stretch.<br />
<br />
&quot;So!&quot; Ty stood as well and clapped his hands. &quot;What do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me?&quot; Buck said excitedly, eyes pathetically hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose we can do that.&quot; Ty cupped his hand over his chin and considered what to do next. &quot;I mean, if we&#39;re going to go get some does, you&#39;ve got to look your best, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty lost it, laughing, as Buck&#39;s little tail rose and wagged. &quot;Sure!&quot; The deer said excitedly, ignoring his friend&#39;s gentle mocking.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right...&quot; Ty cracked his knuckles. &quot;First... I bet the lady deers would like a big strong man to take care of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Buck jolted as he felt Ty&#39;s power flowing through him, and he stared in shock, gasping sharply, as he slowly began to grow. &quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; Buck said between warm breaths, as he began to increase in strength and size. Little by little, he expanded out and up, his legs suddenly growing more defined with muscle, his chest expanding outward, his neck thickening, his body growing taut and his shape tightening from his belly to his rump. His size, too, was increasing by the second. He lowered his head, eyes clenched, and gritted his teeth. It felt *amazing* to grow! Once more, his bone slipped from its sheath, but that too was growing along with the rest of him, pulsating larger and larger until it was well past his original length and swelling to a foot long. Buck raised his head, his proud and rapidly branching antlers, and threw his head back in lust as he became the most perfect example of a huge and manly deer. The kind that hunters spend a lifetime chasing, the kind of beast talked about in whispers around campfires. He grew and grew until his head came up to Ty&#39;s chin and his massive and splendid rack of antlers towered over the teen&#39;s head. His cock twitched, thick and dripping pre, and bobbed against his backwards curving belly.<br />
<br />
With a grunt, Buck began panting as the changes passed, and the newly and impressively grown deer opened his eyes and stood to his full height. He was much closer to an elk than a deer, really, easily able to give the former a run for certain. With a start, the impossibly aroused and impossibly big creature realized he was now looking *down* at his human friend and blinked in quick succession. &quot;I-I&#39;m very big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Ty glanced obviously between his legs, prompting Buck&#39;s thick neck to turn to allow himself to regard his huge new package. &quot;That was my intention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, Ty!&quot; Buck gasped. &quot;Look at that monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big for a deer?&quot; Ty smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big for a moose!&quot; Buck said in disbelief, prompting Ty to laugh again. &quot;I&#39;ll never find a doe big enough to fit me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I guess we&#39;ll just have to find you a lady moose, buddy.&quot; Ty approached the deer&#39;s side and reached under him to feel the size and weight of the deer&#39;s new cock. He blushed deeply, feeling it throb tighter and larger in his gentle little human hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just silly.&quot; Buck smiled, closing his eyes and smiling at Ty&#39;s touch. &quot;Damn. I feel enormous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because you are.&quot; Ty said, pulling Buck&#39;s shaft from base to tip and marveling as it pulsated powerfully in his grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;And strong.&quot; Buck thrust out his meaty chest in delight and melted at Ty&#39;s rubbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re definitely powerful.&quot; Ty agreed, rubbing his hand over Buck&#39;s big powerful thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you going to ride me, then?&quot; Buck chuckled, seeing Ty&#39;s expression change and his hand lower from his cock in alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry?&quot; Ty blinked, now his turn to be suddenly self-conscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know! Around the forest!&quot; Buck said gleefully, laughing at his own joke. &quot;Come on, hop on! I&#39;ll take you to the lake!&quot;</p>
