<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stood alone in a small living room in a relatively rural town looking a small framed photograph. It served to remind me of what those &quot;freak-show&quot; mad scientists had done to Molly. Getting her out of their clutches was not the end of it, that came in the time after her transformation... as if having to adjust to the changes and the practical rejection of her by society wasn't enough. It nearly ruined our graduation from college, and a lot of it was still going on, but I should go back, give you a more detailed retelling of events.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The whole incident had occurred over a break. We had been home from college when it happened. Molly and I had known each other since High School, though up until a year before the &quot;incident&quot; our friendship had been strictly fraternal. I know the whole childhood friends becoming lovers thing sounds cliche, but it does happen. It happened with Molly and me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I had just gotten her out of that freak show's laboratory. She had passed out in my arms after saying they'd &quot;stuck her&quot; with something. I wanted nothing more then to beat them senseless for violating her, but I had to get her out of there, and so I did the only thing I could think to do. I took her home. <br />
<br />
In retrospect, I probably should have taken her to a hospital. I mean, the doctors could have figured out what those freak show guys had actually done and maybe even devised a method to slow it down or even stop it... but at the time I was seeing conspiracies around every corner. I had thought that the freak show people would be waiting for Molly at the hospital and all I'd do was return her to them. So I took her home.<br />
<br />
No one was home when I arrived. My folks were probably still at work, but I had my key and easily entered. I took Molly in and placed her on the living room couch that my parents had. As I set her down, I noticed her skin was practically hot to the touch and I set about to help her out.<br />
<br />
And while I was wetting a washcloth with cold water and trying to think of something I could do, Molly's transformation began. And quickly, I was all too aware of it when I returned to her side.<br />
<br />
Her beautiful red hair was falling out in clumps and her ears appeared to be rounding a bit, as well and beginning to pull up toward the top of her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly!&quot; I gasped stupidly, not really sure what to do.<br />
<br />
I watched in shock and surprise as patches of fur began to grow on her face and arms. On her lips and chin it was white while a spot her right arm was a reddish orange while another spot or left arm was actually black.<br />
<br />
Thinking it was some fever or something from what they did to her, I came forward and put the damp washcloth on her head. It didn't work. She continued to transform before my eyes. Her eyes seemed to flutter, as if she was in some sort of odd dreamscape. I tried to comfort her. Tell her it would be alright, I found her fingernails lengthening into claws and a sort of sheath for them forming on her fingertips. Her fingers also seemed to swelling larger, more heavily muscled.<br />
<br />
A cracking noise then drew my attention away from her hands. It had come from her feet, like her feet were reforming. I looked to them to find that her tennis shoes were stretched. And yes, she had been wearing tennis shoes. It wasn't a formal date we had been on, after all. Her feet were lengthening. As her feet lengthened, I heard faint groans coming from Molly, as if she was in pain. So I did the only thing I could think of to help her. I took her shoes off.<br />
<br />
As I did so, I found that it was not just her hands that were growing larger and more heavily muscled. It was her whole body. Her arms already filled up the sleeves of her shirt and her pants were straining to contain her growing mass, nearly all of it muscle. <br />
<br />
As I pulled her shoes off, I found that her feet were greatly changed. Thick pads covered the underside of her toes and part of her foot. Her foot was covered in red orange fur, with the inside of her foot covered in white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening to you?&quot; I asked to myself, again not sounding all that smart, but I didn't know what to do.<br />
<br />
Her body continued to grow larger and more heavily muscled. I stood there stupefied as her waist snapped the button her jeans and shoulders, breasts, and abdomen began to stretch her shirt past its limits. And it was then that Molly woke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...!&quot; she stuttered and tried to right herself, only to roll onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Looking at her I could see that she was now easily bigger then I was. The back of her jeans began to rip as her growing size was too much for them to contain. As her pants split with a loud rip, I noticed a red orange and black striped nub begin to grow out of the newly ripped hole. It was soon thrashing around as Molly obviously hadn't learned she could control the limb yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a tail!&quot; I blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Molly gasped with greater force then she had ever before.<br />
<br />
She then turned her head and I saw them in her half open mouth from the shock of everything. Her canine teeth were lengthening into fangs, and her nose had formed into a small pink triangle. And her face was pushing slightly forward. Her facial bones seemed to crack as her face changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;IT HURTS!&quot; Molly practically roared as her face pushed out into a relatively short feline muzzle.<br />
<br />
She then stood up for a moment, her clothing finally losing their battle completely. And she stood there in front of me, completely nude. Now don't get anything wrong. NOTHING sexual happened... at that point. I tried to look away, but I couldn't as I recognized what they had turned Molly into.<br />
<br />
She was a tiger... well tigress, her present nudity made it pretty clear that she was still female. Her hair was gone, laying on the couch and floor beneath her, and she stood at a very impressive height, somewhere between eight and nine feet tall, the tips of her rounded ears brushing against the ceiling.<br />
<br />
The back of her ears was largely black, with a small white &quot;dot&quot; near the top, while the inside of her ears was filled with white fur. The sides of her muzzle and the lower portion of her head was white, and there were two white  patches above her greenish-yellow eyes. Her neck, breasts, belly, inner thighs and calves was also covered in white fur. The rest was a reddish orange color. <br />
<br />
And then there was the stripes. Black in color, they banded around her face, cheeks, shoulders body, and legs. On her tail they were a series of black bands that interrupted the orange of her fur, with the end of her tail tipped with black fur. On her body, they seemed to wrap around her, running from her white belly on to her red orange sides and back.<br />
<br />
And also, for clarification, Molly's arms and legs were not striped the way most &quot;cartoon&quot; tigers were. Tony the Tiger, on Frosted Flakes boxes and Marvel Comics' Tigra had small stripes that ran parallel to the ground. Molly's stripes there ran down the arm and perpendicular to the ground below her. It looked a little odd while she was standing up, but her stripe pattern would make sense if she was on all fours. Tigers were quadrupeds and their fur pattern was designed to aide in that. The fact that Molly was a biped didn't change the genetics of Panthera Tigris.<br />
<br />
After a moment, Molly noticed my starring and tried to cover up her breasts and her vagina with her more paw-like hands. And for those of you who MUST know, while her breasts were larger then they were before, considering her increased musculature, Molly's cup size is actually smaller now.<br />
<br />
&quot;GEORGE!&quot; Molly gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said weakly, &quot;It's... it's... it's... you look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GEORGE!&quot; she repeated, not really wanting to hear that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; I sighed, not knowing what to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;GEORGE, WHAT AM I TO DO?&quot; Molly asked, not able to control how powerful her voice was now, she would gain that later.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said weakly as I had turned away, &quot;I got you away from those freak show people and I tried to help... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard a sigh and then footsteps.<br />
<br />
&quot;IT'S ALRIGHT, GEORGE,&quot; she spoke and lifted me into a hug from behind.<br />
<br />
My head end up just below her chin as she held me to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could work on the volume of your voice though that would help,&quot; I told her, probably at the wrong time, &quot;your roaring might get us in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hugged me tighter, collapsed onto the floor with a loud thump, lowered her head onto my shoulder and began to cry.</p>
