<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chisai and Odayakana walked silently beside one another for quite some time. Each would occasionally look at the other and turn their head away quickly before the other noticed they were looking at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....what did you have planned for the day?&quot; Odayakana asked wanting to finally break the silence between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, I was thinking that first we would,&quot; Chisai quickly looked at the paper his mother had given him quickly to see what she had written. &quot;Go up the hill shrine that has that beautiful view of the waterfall at the top.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;ve been to that one before. I went to it with my mother a long time ago. We had such a lovely time there. I do remember it was quite a walk, at one point after we rested, my mother had to carry me.&quot; Odayakana remembered.<br />
<br />
The two of them made their way to the entrance to the hill shrine where there were a plethora of Torii gates that led towards the very top. They could see plenty of other kitsunes there ranging from the young to the old. Chisai and Odayakana made their way up the steps and both had to admit that the view on the way to the top was just as beautiful.<br />
<br />
As Chisai looked at people on the path, he saw an older kitsune couple sitting comfortably together. It was clear that the two had been with each other for a long time, just like his parents and wondered if this date would lead to a relationship at all. Odayakana was seeing other kitsunes as well on the path. She saw a couple of kitsune parents with two young kits, and the mother kitsune was very pregnant and looked like she was expecting any day now. She thought what it would be like if her date with Chisai went well, would the two of them marry? Have children of their own? The thought made Odayakana turn a little red in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re tired, we can sit down a moment?&quot; Chisai offered as they came to a bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES I WOULD!&quot; Odayakana replied rather loudly. &quot;I...I mean, yes, I would like that.&quot; Odayakana said in her more softer voice this time.<br />
<br />
The two of them sat on the bench and enjoyed the serene atmosphere of the hill. They were only halfway up, but they still had a bit of a ways to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....if I may ask: how....how have you been enjoying yourself? I mean...not now, but since the end of the war.&quot; Chisai asked trying to think of a topic that might get their minds off the date for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll admit that when your brother said he was escorting myself and Ikur&#333; to the capital, I was....certainly perplexed to say the very least. When we had heard the famous kitsune warrior was bound for the Shimizu clan, I feared the worst. After all, Hinata had fought under our banners, my banners. Sometimes I think myself a coward for ever siding with her in the war. I felt like....like such a coward.&quot; Odayakana said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know why you did it and I don&#39;t blame you. You did it to protect your clan. I could never see you as a coward for what you did.&quot; Chisai said boosting her spirits up a little bit making her give him a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, but you must know, it was certainly....frightening to hear that Fukushu, the famous warrior was coming to my home. But not to put us in chains, but escort us to see your parents for peace negotiations. When we finally arrived at the capital and began formally talking with your parents, that was when I saw it true that we were entering an era of peace. But to answer your earlier question, I have been enjoying myself. Kari and Haley have become such great friends to me.&quot; Odayakana finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy you&#39;re enjoying yourself. Like the rest of my family, I would do whatever it takes to make you happy.&quot; Chisai declared as Odayakana gently placed her hand on Chisai&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Chisai saw her making the move, but it didn&#39;t frighten him, he slowly put his hand around hers and the both smiled at each other. Odayakana now looked up the hill to see how much further they would have to walk and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess we should keep moving if we want to get to the top before we both grow white hair on our fur.&quot; Odayakana said with smirk and a wink.<br />
<br />
Chisai wanted to retort back to her, but he instead found himself chuckling at her remark. They both then stood up and made their way up the rest of the hill. Once they finally reached the top, Odayakana was awestruck by the majesty of the waterfall just a short distance away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Chisai, it&#39;s....it&#39;s more magnificent in person than I ever thought it was in my imagination.&quot; Odayakana said as she stepped just close enough to feel the gentle fine spray of mist.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was definitely worth the climb.&quot; Chisai said as he stood closely by Odayakana.<br />
<br />
Odayakana slipped her fingers in-between Chisai&#39;s as they grasped their hands together while gazing at the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Odayakana suddenly said as she felt something fall on her nose.<br />
<br />
They both then felt something falling on them as they realized that it had begun raining. But it didn&#39;t just start raining, it began to pour as Odayakana screamed out in shock as it began pouring all over her. They both ran over the shrine that was at the top of the hill for cover and shook themselves off. Luckily for them, there were some convenient towels that had been left for visitors just outside the doors of the shrine that were dry. Odayakana gently dried herself off, while Chisai dried himself off a little more roughly leading to the fur on his body looking very fluffy. Odayakana couldn&#39;t help but laugh at this as she then used the towel she had to make her own fur look just as fluffy and the two of them laughed together at how they looked. Both continued laughing as they now stood next to each other as they waited out the rain. Odayakana slowly began to stand next to Chisai, who didn&#39;t mind it at all.<br />
<br />
After the rain had finally let up and the two of them made their way all the back down the hill, the weather had changed for the better.<br />
<br />
&quot;That walk up and down the hill made me a little hungry, where did you plan on us eating?&quot; Odayakana asked as Chisai suddenly remembered his paper and took a quick look at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had thought we might go to the Tsubaki Cafe.&quot; Chisai said as he put the paper away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! The Tsubaki Cafe, I have often heard of it, but never had a reason to go to it before now. Come on!&quot; Odayakana said cheerfully as she pulled Chisai along with him towards the cafe.<br />
<br />
Reaching their destination of the Tsubaki Cafe, the two gazed in wonder at the inside of the restaurant which had a beautiful atmosphere with Tsubaki floral decorations inside the restaurant as the flowers were hung from the ceiling and on the columns. They were both led to a table where they ordered drinks. Odayakana asked for a H&#333;jicha, while Chisai decided to ask for green tea. After waiting a while and talking about their day, their drinks were finally brought to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chisai, I have to know and please don&#39;t lie to me, I&#39;ll know. That list your mother gave you, you didn&#39;t actually write it, did you?&quot; Odayakana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No, no Odayakana, I didn&#39;t. To be honest, I haven&#39;t been on a date in a very long time. But, this one with you has been one of my best.&quot; Chisai complimented as Odayakana blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must confess too Chisai, although there are many who would ask me out, I haven&#39;t been on a date in a long time either. I had been so concentrated on leading the Shimizu clan, that I thought there wasn&#39;t any more time for dating.&quot; Odayakana confessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we have a chance to sit and talk, I wonder if we have anything in common? I guess I can start. I love my family like anyone would. I&#39;ve been a blacksmith for a majority of my life like you might have guessed. I spend a lot of my time in my workshop, crafting swords, fulfilling orders for the old and the young, and spending a lot of my time....alone there.&quot; Chisai said as he suddenly grew quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes, sometimes I do like to get away from it all. I like to go out and relax, but I don&#39;t go to the palace. I go into the forest for a little solitude. It was something my sister Yomi used to do to help me whenever I had a stressful situation. She showed me the beauty of our home and how we can just look at it every once in a while and appreciate it.&quot; Chisai finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I too love the beauty of our homeland. Sometimes the stress of political talks grows very....tiring for me and I just like to appreciate nature. I suppose that&#39;s actually two things we have in common. We both work so hard in our own fields, and we appreciate the simple things that others sometimes take for granted.&quot; Odayakana said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I do also have a love for your family. Haley and Kari are some of the best friends I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve also had the pleasure of meeting Aaron and Mason and they each have a trait that reminds me just a little of you. You&#39;re polite, kind....strong.&quot; Odayakana complimented as Chisai chuckled and blushed a little bit.<br />
<br />
Eventually the two of them were brought their food and had a delicious meal. Odayakana thought it was a good way to end the day and asked to return back to the Dragon Castle where she had been staying at for the time being.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...suppose this is the end of our date now.&quot; Chisai said with a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it does look that way. I have had a wonderful time today Chisai, I hope we may do it another day, if....that pleases you.&quot; Odayakana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would Odayakana. This has been one of the best days of my life.&quot; Chisai said as the two were still a little nervous, but gently took the other&#39;s hands and slowly brought their mouths to each other and kissed.<br />
<br />
It was just nice at first, but then the two began kissing each other more passionately embracing each other closely before the two of them stopped and looked at one another in the eyes. Both them looked at each other without saying a word at first before Chisai slowly grew a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The stars twinkle in your eyes tonight.&quot; Chisai finally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you do yours.&quot; Odayakana said back to him as the two of them slowly broke apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think....I will be visiting your shop more often now Chisai.&quot; Odayakana said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that very much.&quot; Chisai said as he watched the two tailed vixen wag her tails as she walked inside the castle.<br />
<br />
Chisai proceeded home and took in a deep breath before laying down on his bed thinking about the day and it had been one of the best days of his entire life. He couldn&#39;t wait to see Odayakana again.</p>
