_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
The next morning, Morgan awoke to find his new room mate was still out. He must have gone home for the weekend. As the light shone through the half-drawn shades, he realized a few sensations. One, he was feeling fairly well-rested. Odd considering the body-theft that happened, but he was pleasantly surprised by that. Next, was the morning wood at full erection. Seth was a virile one, Morgan guessed. Reaching down out of habit, he was sliding his fingers along the shaft before realized that this wasn&#39;t his penis.<br />
<br />
He let go, and laid there thinking about the morality of jacking someone elses penis while occupying their body. But morality mattered little when the only reason he was in this body at all was because the shrimp stole his own body. But still, he wanted to get up and going with his day. Looking at Seth&#39;s phone, Caleb had texted him from Andrew&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
-You up?- Caleb&#39;s text read.<br />
<br />
-Yeah, I&#39;ll be getting showered. Meet you at the dining hall in like 30 minutes?- Morgan texted back.<br />
<br />
-Sounds good.- Caleb responded. <br />
<br />
As Morgan was about to put down Seth&#39;s phone, he noticed a folder of apps, hidden in the middle of all the random app games and social media. Clicking on it to expand it, he found a familiar icon. It was an app meant for gay men to meet up with others. Clicking on that, he found himself looking at the familiar grid of mostly torsos, blank pics, and the occasional face. Out of curiosity, Morgan checked out Seth&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
It was blank, which made some sense to Morgan. All it really had for identifying info was Seth&#39;s age and ethnicity. After that, he decided to check out Seth&#39;s conversations. His eyes bulged when he realized that Seth had tried chatting with his own account just a few days ago!<br />
<br />
Now Morgan was having a million thoughts all at once. Was Seth some sort of pervert, wanting to get into Morgans pants, but because he wouldn&#39;t respond to Seth&#39;s faceless profile, Seth decided to LITERALLY get into his pants? Or was it revenge for ignoring him? Or a kinky thing?<br />
<br />
Feeling slightly skeeved out, he checked out some other chats. Something he noticed was that each person Seth tried talking to, they each were chubby guys. Either Seth has a type, Morgan thought, or he wanted to experiment being a bigger guy for some bizarre reason. In terms of looks, Seth and Morgan weren&#39;t exactly 10&#39;s. But Morgan had always been self-aware about his weight, not holding any delusions about his appearance. He was also pragmatic about it, knowing that being fat just carried other burdens. Hell, Morgan had to admit that one of the only upsides of being Seth so far was how light and skinny he is.<br />
<br />
Hopping out of bed, he was reminded of that fact again. Seth was no gymnast, or an athlete at all, but without the weight of a large gut, he was able to swing his whole body about, jump up or down, without feeling like he was straining too much. Maybe this would be the reason he got to work losing weight in his real body. Having a taste of this lighter form was a good example to what life could be like.<br />
<br />
Morgan cobbled together shampoo, towel, soaps and more to take to the bathroom. He was about to go to town on Seth, and see just what he could do for this body.<br />
<br />
In the shower stall, hot water cascading over his body, he lathered his body with soap, and formed a thick layer of suds in his short-cropped hair. It was sort of sad that he could smell the decent soap Seth owned, but hadn&#39;t ever detected it on Seth before. Morgan suddenly became very wary of how Seth might treat his body. He wasn&#39;t the pinnacle of self-manicuring, but he still bathed. Being fat, you really can&#39;t go a day without a shower. He gulped in anxiety, as he rinsed his hair out. At least he could tell there was an immediate relief in feeling hair that was now purged of the oils that had deeply saturated it before.<br />
<br />
Later, in Seth&#39;s room again he now prepared to dress himself. Most of Seth&#39;s clothing were t-shirts and jeans. At least jeans were sort of a universal article of clothing. Digging around, he found some more sweaters. He wanted to see what Seth would look like with a more preppy outfit, so he pulled out a button-up shirt, over an undershirt (Morgan would have been feeling warm, even in the Fall coolness, with these layers, but Seth needed it. He seemed to get colder faster. After the button-up, he pulled a sweater over and let the collar pop out. It was definitely a more &quot;done up&quot; look than Seth usually went for. With the jeans and converses following, Morgan realized he kind of pulled off a hipster vibe, but at least he looked clean. <br />
<br />
Running his hands through Seth&#39;s short hair, he was pleased to feel it was not oily. The guy was in desperate need of a little maintenance. And maybe some love? Morgan decided that since he was already going all the way with Seth&#39;s appearance, he was going to put himself out there. This body clearly wanted sexual release, and he was going to see what he could find with the apps. Snapping a picture in the full length mirror, he quickly posted it before sending a text to Caleb letting him know he was on his way to the dining hall.</p>
