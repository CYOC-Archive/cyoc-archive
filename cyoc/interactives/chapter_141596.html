<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Okay, I&#39;ll admit it, I was nervous all day. I mean between the Venus Three and Lara I was pretty certain that night was going to involve all sorts of sexy shenanigans but not knowing was making me anxious. The day dragged on as a result, me spending much of my time surrounded by the trio with Lara meeting up with us later. She seemed happy about something and I could only assume she had left me for some sort of sexy rendezvous. I didn&#39;t mind, so long as she was back by my side once again. Hell, I wasn&#39;t even bothered by the fact that she probably fucked another guy aside from me. Perhaps it was because she had that full disclosure with me before, or maybe I truly wasn&#39;t the jealous type. I don&#39;t know for sure. That night I found myself standing in the hall outside Lara&#39;s room waiting for her to change. It was quaint, to think that a woman who could change her appearance at will bothered with something so cumbersome as regular clothes rather than just conjuring up a wardrobe. Imagine the time she&#39;d save... then again perhaps she was more fascinated with the concept of stripping and shopping. I was becoming nervous, feeling like this was somehow a date we were going on. The anxiety made me pace back and forth, clapping my hands together and doing all sorts or nervous ticks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jethro? Are you alright?&quot; came a sudden question. I turned to see the familiar face of Charity, and realized that we hadn&#39;t engaged in the usual rendezvous she&#39;d become accustomed to. Her expression was filled with genuine concern and she seemed to ask the question from a place of ernest interest than mere formality. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, I&#39;m uh- just waiting for Lara to get dressed,&quot; I stammered nervously, half wondering if Charity was going to try and drag me into her room at the end of the hall. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, going out on a date?&quot; she smirked, cocking a smug eyebrow. Odd, I thought she would have been jealous or at least a little annoyed. Instead she took the idea in stride. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly,&quot; I chuckled. Just as I was about to continue explaining Lara opened the door to her room, adjusting her long red locks before stepping out and pulling the door closed behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe, what do you think?&quot; she asked, posing in a strapless top and tight, albeit knee-length, skirt. Naturally they looked specifically designed to excentuate her most exciting parts and I couldn&#39;t help but feel an erection coming along.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you look-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stunning,&quot; Charity interrupted, eyes drinking in Lara&#39;s frame. &quot;Positively stunning,&quot; she sighed, almost as though admitting some kind of defeat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; Lara giggled. &quot;It&#39;s not often I get complements from other ladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s your plans for tonight?&quot; Charity asked, flashing an adorable smile our way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, not much we&#39;re just hanging out with a couple classmates. Do you want to join us?&quot; Lara asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... sure,&quot; Charity replied hesitantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great! The more the merrier!&quot; The three of us walked down the hall, eventually coming to Su and Aubrey&#39;s room. I knocked on the door just to have it swing open mid-knock and be greeted by the bubbly Aubrey. She had done her hair up into two french braids that circled around her head and combined in the back. She wore a black spaghetti strap top and loose pajama pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; she squealed, giggling as she hugged Lara who appeared just as giddy. Su sat on her bed in the background looking very uncomfortable as she was wearing a tight crop top that she kept pulling at to hide her midriff while also crossing her legs to prevent anyone from peering up her miniskirt. I could only assume Aubrey had somehow coaxed the girl into wearing such an outfit. Sophia was also there, wearing a black lace cocktail dress. It seemed she was looking to impress rather than show off. I still had to wonder why she involved herself with all this when it seemed to displease her so. &quot;We were just waiting on you, and- Oh, Charity, I didn&#39;t know you were coming,&quot; she smiled, giving Charity an unexpected squeeze. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lara invited me,&quot; she explained awkwardly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no need to explain, you&#39;re the RA! You&#39;re like the guest of honor now, come in, come in,&quot; Aubrey encouraged, ushering us into the room. There wasn&#39;t much to the dorm, or at least as far as we could see. The mini fridge was stocked with sodas and the large round table in the middle held all manner of snack foods that would be stereotypical of college students. The night seemed innocent enough, all of us sitting around the table playing games and just having fun. Lara sat next to me with Sophia beside her, then Aubrey across from me with Charity, and Su taking up the flank before coming back to me. The night rolled on with all of us sharing stories, conversations, and laughs as we played several iterations of games. I was actually surprised by how normal all of this felt. There was no sex, no teasing, Lara was even keeping her hands to herself for once. I cracked open another soda and drank the first few swallows of sweet carbonation before setting the can on the table top. It was late. No one had a clock or watch but I could tell by how the rowdiness had given way to low energy and leisure. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I have to admit, this was really fun,&quot; Sophia admitted, drinking down her own can of soda. &quot;I had my doubts considering... present company. But... it was actually nice to all hang out together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, here sister,&quot; Charity grinned, clanging her drink against Sophia&#39;s as the two shared a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should do this every Friday,&quot; Aubrey suggested. &quot;Every week make it something different. I bet there&#39;s plenty of stuff to do in town. We could see movies, hang out in the mall, I even know of a diner with a pool hall down the street a ways. What do you all say? Venus Club forever?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Venus Club?&quot; Charity asked, cocking an interested eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t know? We&#39;re all part of this new club that Lara started. You should totally join! Oh, my gosh!&quot; Aubrey blinked as though being struck with a sudden realization. &quot;We totally need to come up with some sort of initiation,&quot; she suggested, looking at Lara who smiled at the thought. &quot;You did say there&#39;d be more members.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s an interesting idea,&quot; Lara smirked. &quot;Well, Charity, wanna join?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other looked at Lara, seeming uncertain what to think about the offer. &quot;I don&#39;t know, what does it entail?&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing you haven&#39;t been doing already,&quot; she answered. &quot;The Venus Club is for those who want to sleep with Jethro. Since you&#39;ve already been doing a lot of that, you may as well just join our little group.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you&#39;ve been sleeping with Jethro? No way!&quot; came the varied responses from the other girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Charity grinned, dismissing how our relationship had just been exposed. &quot;I mean you&#39;ve already exposed me, I might as well join in. I&#39;m assuming this club respects each member&#39;s privacy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Venus Club is exclusive for a reason,&quot; Lara replied. &quot;None of us will talk about Jethro, or our relations to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So this club has rules?&quot; Su interjected, seeming more comfortable with the group than she had at the beginning of the night. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very simple ones. I&#39;ll make a list later,&quot; Lara assured her, sipping the last remnants of her canned drink. &quot;Tonight is for fun. So how about we have an impromptu initiation,&quot; she smirked, producing a deck of cards. &quot;What do you think of strip poker?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes please,&quot; Aubrey licked her lips giggling at the thought. It didn&#39;t surprise me at all that she would be the first to approve. This kind of thing seemed straight up her alley. The others did not seem as eager. <br />
<br />
Charity seemed to contemplate the offer for a moment before shrugging, &quot;why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Su remained silent while Sophia reluctantly agreed. With that said we cleared what trash was on the table and Lara began dealing. &quot;Regular Poker rules,&quot; Lara stated, still dealing the cards, &quot;Weakest hand strips an article of clothing. Aubrey, could you turn up the thermostat, it&#39;s about to get warm in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand 1:<br />
Nervously we all showed our hands, everyone trying to remember what combination beat what. I already knew I&#39;d lost though, only having a pair of twos to show. &quot;Oh, well,&quot; Lara smirked, &quot;Your loss is our gain. So go on, give us a good show,&quot; she teased. I looked around noticing every one of the girls were staring with the same interest and intrigue as Lara. They wanted a show and I wouldn&#39;t disappoint. I stood up and tried my best to make a sight of stripping off my shirt. Unfortunately I was less than graceful which encouraged a few laughs at my expense. However when I had finally gotten free of the shirt the girls all stared. I wasn&#39;t sure at what, I wasn&#39;t exactly muscular, just some skinny nerdy guy who had five girls drooling over the sight of my nipples. <br />
<br />
Hand 2: <br />
Charity lost this one, her two pair seeming the weakest hand of the group. She smiled, flipping Lara off before standing up and dropping her jeans. I felt my dick harden as I beheld her in black lacy panties with a tiny pink bow on the waistband. Damn it looked cute, and her toned thighs were nothing to sneeze at. &quot;See anything you like?&quot; Charity smirked at me, the girl unrecognizable from how she was when we first met. &quot;I was a cheerleader after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand 3: <br />
&quot;Oh, well, I&#39;ll take that loss,&quot; Aubrey shrugged as her high card did nothing but assure her defeat. She stood up, looking at me while bighting her lower lip and sensually stripping her top off, slowly raising the bottom up to unveil her pierced navel and then her black push-up bra that barely contained her breasts. She gave her girls a grope before sitting down again. <br />
<br />
Hand 4:<br />
I lost again, trying for a straight but failing miserably. &quot;Ooh, take it off,&quot; Lara howled, Aubrey joining in as I undid my pants and pulled them down, tossing them aside and sitting in my boxers. I could swear Aubrey and Lara were spirit twins.<br />
<br />
Hand 5: <br />
Sophia lost this time, looking at the group with a sort of sneer. She stood up, opting to remove her heels much to everyone&#39;s disapproval. &quot;I&#39;m wearing a dress,&quot; she growled in response to the barbs the others sent her way. &quot;If I don&#39;t be careful you&#39;ll have me naked in two hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand 6: <br />
I couldn&#39;t believe Lara finally lost. She had been getting all the best hands to the point where I thought she would remain the only one clothed. She smiled, reaching behind her back and unfastening her strapless bra before fishing it out of her top and throwing it on the table. &quot;Oh, Lara no...&quot; Aubrey whined. &quot;You&#39;re suppose to show the goods not hide them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t pout my little one,&quot; Lara smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll put on a fantastic show when you win this top from me. &quot;<br />
<br />
Hand 7:<br />
Su lost, freezing as she was told how she had to strip something off. The shy girl stood up, reaching towards her wrist and unfastening a small black watch she had on before tossing it on the table. &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Aubrey and Lara scoffed. &quot;The last three hands no one&#39;s shown any skin! Come on, Su, be daring, be bold!&quot;<br />
<br />
Su didn&#39;t seem to take the challenge well at first, holding her hands together with embarassment. After a while, however, she finally bit her lip, a bit of resolve and defiance filling her gaze. &quot;You want bold?! Fine!&quot; she scoffed, reaching under her small skirt and pulling down her panties. She stepped out of them and tossed them across the table, the crotch of her underwear landing on my face. &quot;How&#39;s that for daring?&quot; she chided. All the girls oohed at her gesture as I removed the lacy garment from my face. I had to admit, Su surprised me by that. <br />
<br />
Hand 8:<br />
I lost again, the girls not seeming to care as they all whooped and hollered for me to remove my last trace of clothing. I did so, showing the eight inch erection I was sporting to the table full of girls, each admiring it for a while. &quot;New rule ladies, every time you lose and strip something off, you need to give his dick some loving,&quot; Lara smiled, dealing out the next hand. &quot;Let&#39;s keep him hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand 11:<br />
Sophia sat in her underwear, sporting a lacy black bra, matching panties, and garters that connected to her stockings. She looked like a latina pin-up girl and I was loving it, her dress tossed aside in an act of uncharacteristic apathy while Aubrey had already let her girls out to see the world. Now it was Lara&#39;s turn to lose. She promise us a show and she gave it, tucking her shirt up under her boobs before lifting it up and over. Her enormous breasts raised with the shirt until the fabric abandoned them, allowing the two fleshy orbs to drop and bounce. I walked over to her as she smiled and gave my dick a nice kiss. <br />
<br />
Hand 15:<br />
Charity smiled as she stood up. Things were rolling along, my dick was soaked and every girl was in a state of undress. Lara was already down to a thong only while Sophia sat braless and Aubrey was in her bra and underwear. I was certain Charity would take off her top but it seemed she had other plans. This was becoming a contest for the girls to see who could get my attention best. Looking at me with lust filled eyes she winked, reaching up to her waistband and pulling down at her panties. Everyone stared in total silence as she bared her pink pussy for all to see. I walked over, Charity grabbing my dick and teasing my glans agains her pussy lips. &quot;Soon I&#39;ll have you in there again,&quot; she whispered. <br />
<br />
Hand 22: <br />
Sophia looked down at me with a sexy smile, her persona finally loosening up and enjoying the moment. I couldn&#39;t say any different as my erection twitched with what I was about to do. Sophia had lost but insisted that I strip her next garment: her stockings. Of course that would require me to remove her garters which she insisted I do with my teeth. All the other girls thought this was hot as fuck and insisted I do it. So I did, enjoying how close my face was to her honeypot. After plucking the garters with my teeth I pulled her stockings down and off, taking note to kiss and lick her feet as I did. She offered a shiver in response.<br />
<br />
Hand 25:<br />
Su was the last. All the other girls were naked and Su, Su held the last piece of cloth, her panties. Just as Sophia had insisted upon me removing her garters, Su wanted me to strip her down to the last. She appeared nervous, not surprising considering she was a virgin, but it still looked cute. She flinched as I took her waistband and gently pulled them down past her ankles. She shivered, obviously very anxious. I looked up, bringing my face close to her petite pussy and breathing in gently. &quot;Damn, that&#39;s hot,&quot; Aubrey whispered, the ensemble of girls standing naked around me. I couldn&#39;t believe my luck. Five beautiful women as varied as could be standing around in their birthday suits, as was I. I was honestly surprised no one&#39;s &#39;loving&#39; had made me climax. I guess I shouldn&#39;t be, knowing Lara&#39;s magic. <br />
<br />
&quot;So girls, what happens now?&quot; Lara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s obvious,&quot; Aubrey smiled, coming up behind me and planting a kiss on my face. I stood up, cock poking out erect before me, something Aubrey decided to touch and stroke. After a few moments she broke away from me. &quot;Time for your to pop Su&#39;s cherry,&quot; she whispered. Su could barely ask what Aubrey said before the latter was already attaking the young girl, rubbing her clit and sucking on her perky tit. Su moaned, looking at Sophia and calling for help. Sophia stared, a bit of wetness dripping from her snatch as she knelt beside Su and began administering similar affections to her other boob. Both the original Venus girls were sucking Su&#39;s breast, pausing for a second to kiss each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Charity exclaimed as she beheld the sight before her and then Lara&#39;s hand snaked up under her pussy. <br />
<br />
&quot;They might be busy for a while, how about we spend some time together,&quot; Lara whispered, rubbing Charity&#39;s clit and groping her boob. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do I do?&quot; I asked as Charity let out a moan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you want dear, this is our initiation after all. This club this... harem, is yours. Isn&#39;t that right girls?&quot; Lara called. They all shouted out various forms of agreement as I looked around to see who I wanted to join.</p>
