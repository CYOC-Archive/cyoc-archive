<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everyone in the courtroom stood, except for Dustin. Dustin couldn&#39;t stand, not anymore. He looked over to the defendant stand where the man who put him in the wheelchair he was currently in was standing. Like Dustin he was wearing a suit, but that&#39;s where the similarity between the two men ended.<br />
<br />
Dustin Jacobson was a computer programmer in his forties. He had always been a bit on the short and scrawny side, he never grew out of his high school nerdiness. Pale from spending most of his time indoors, he also wore thick glasses, his brown hair was an unstyled mop and was actually beginning to grey. Age had given him a small potbelly, though it was hardly noticeable unless he was naked. Sure, he had never been athletic, but being put in the chair had completely upended his life. His legs no longer worked, even worse his cock no longer worked. It wasn&#39;t an impressive cock, but it was his. He could still move his arms, but everything below his lower back was numb. He looked away from the man at the defendant&#39;s table and up to the judge. Staring is what got him in this mess in the first place.<br />
<br />
The defendant, Cody Santoni, was completely different from the man suing him. At twenty-six years old he was young enough to be Dustin&#39;s son. Though no one would think them related, Cody was the stereotypical Italian stallion. He stood over six feet tall and had a large muscular build earned by spending hours each day at the gym. He had a naturally swarthy complexion and didn&#39;t need tanner for that bronze glow. His hair was dark black and styled in a undercut. He had just the right amount of stubble on his face and kept himself smooth everywhere else. His eyes were an icy blue that stood out in contrast to his darker complexion.His suit fit him perfectly, and the top few buttons of his shirt were undone to show the tops of his pectorals as well as a gold chain he wore. The suit also did little to hide the bulge in his trousers between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be seated.&quot; Now Judge Loggia, he looked like he could be related to Cody, and right now he was giving him a stare that would put any disapproving father to shame. Though his expression softens considerably when he turns his attention on Dustin and his attorney. &quot;As I understand it, Mr. Jacobson, you were injured in a bar brawl six months ago resulting in permanent paralysis and medical bills of over.. a hundred thousand dollars?&quot; The judge was checking the papers in front of him to make sure he was getting the figure right but still sounds surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s correct, your honor.&quot; Dustin answered himself, keeping his eyes on the judge and away from Cody.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Mr. Santoni here was the one that caused your injuries?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct, your honor.&quot; Dustin echoed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you tell me what happened?&quot; The judge leaned back in the chair and smiled reassuringly at Dustin. He had to admit, the judge was a good looking man, and just his type. Which is why..<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your honor. I had gone to the bar that evening with a few coworkers to hit the happy hour after we got off work.  I must have been looking at the defendant as he started to..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The little faggot was drooling looking at me!&quot; Cody burst out, causing the judge to slam his gavel on his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough out of you Mr. Santoni, you will have your turn, but if you use that language again in my courtroom, I&#39;ll have you thrown out. Clear?&quot; Cody actually seemed to shrink under judge Loggia&#39;a rage and just nodded.<br />
<br />
Oh, Dustin definitely had been drooling and checking him out, he could still picture the tight jeans and tank top Cody had been wearing, showing off those strong muscular arms. Dustin would be popping wood right there thinking about it if it worked anymore. &quot;Well, he must have thought I was staring, he got in my face, starting using all sorts of homophobic language.. and.. I really don&#39;t remember much after he punched me the first time, but I woke up in the hospital a week later like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody began to mumble something under his breath but the snap of the gavel stopped him short. &quot;One more word, and I add hate crime to the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judge Loggia hefted the file. &quot;I have police reports, signed witness affidavits, security footage, doctor&#39;s reports, everything here backs up Mr. Jacobson&#39;s side of the story. Do you have anything to say for yourself Mr. Santoni, because I feel I&#39;m very much ready to render my verdict now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody just shook his head, anything he could say would just make things look worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smartest thing you&#39;ve done all day. In that case, I rule in favor of the plaintiff. Looking at your bank statements you currently have ten thousand dollars in the bank. Half the liquid assets you have currently shall be seized and turned over to the plaintiff, and your wages henceforth will be garnished twenty percent until his medical costs are met. Now, for the issue of damages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody turned pale. He had to know what this was in regards to. Dustin had filed this claim specially for this. He hope the judge had pity on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing as you took a perfectly functioning body from Mr. Jacobson, you should be required to provide him with a new one. Therefore I am granting the plaintiff&#39;s petition for a body swap in this case, with a duration of life.&quot; Judge Loggia delivered the verdict with a small smile, seeming to relish the ruling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life?! But I can&#39;t do my job without..&quot; Cody looked over to Dustin in his wheelchair. &quot;I mean, I need legs to do my job, I&#39;ll get fired.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judge Loggia shrugged. &quot;The court will help place you in a new job that will meet with your needs in the interest of seeing your payments to Mr. Jacobson continue. Plenty of desk jobs don&#39;t require working legs. You broke it, you bought it Mr. Santoni.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cody leaped to his feet and overturned the table in front of him, his temper suddenly exploding. &quot;No! You&#39;re not going to take my body from me!&quot; Two officers descended upon him and got him under control, even though he was still ranting and raving about not giving up his body.<br />
<br />
When the judge spoke up he was able to speak loud enough to be heard over Cody. &quot;Sedate him and take him to processing room one, immediately. I want this done now. And then he can spend thirty days in lock up in his new body to think about his actions. Bailiff, please escort Mr. Jacobson to processing room two.&quot; As Cody was dragged, kicking and screaming the bailiff came over to Dustin, offering to push him to the processing rooms in the courthouse. The officer was silent, during the trip over, and Dustin didn&#39;t want to talk anyway. He was still relishing in his victory. His brain inside that body. He just hoped the temper didn&#39;t come with it.<br />
<br />
The room they came to was simple, stark white. A tube to lay in was up against one wall and tons of computer equipment was up against the other. The doctor in the room and the bailiff helped Dustin to strip his clothes off and set them aside for when Cody woke up. His personal items like his phone and wallet went to his lawyer to bring to him in his new body. Then he lay down in the tube, with some helping getting into it, the cover slid shut, and it was just like going to sleep.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was he could feel his legs. It felt wonderful just to curl his toes and stretch out his feet. Then he put out his hand automatically as he did waking up every morning since childhood, but there was no table next to he bed he lay on. &quot;Glasses..&quot; He muttered. His voice was deeper than he was used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t need them anymore. Perfect twenty twenty vision.&quot; That was his lawyers voice. As the fog lifted he remembered where he was and what had just happened. He opened his eyes and sure enough he could see perfectly fine. He looked down at himself and a truly unfamiliar sight of two large pectoral muscles blocking his vision. He sat up easily, and looked over the rest of his body. Chiseled six pack, thick muscular legs and arms, and holy shit.. Dustin had figured Cody was hung but that must be seven inches of soft cock resting against his thigh. He wasn&#39;t just hung, he was a donkey. His fingers twitched, wanting to touch it and see how big it would get, but three pairs of eyes on him stopped him. His lawyer, the doctor, and judge Loggia were all staring at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite a shock, I know. Especially with such a drastic change.&quot; The judge spoke from  his own experience. &quot;I got my own body in much a similar way. Though I figured you would want to keep your own identity in this case.&quot; He tapped a bin holding his wallet, phone, keys and other things, then added a court order tri-folded in blue to the top. &quot;You&#39;ll need to take that order to get yourself some new identification. I doubt your picture matches anymore. We&#39;ll leave you to get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.. judge..&quot; The doctor and his lawyer were out the room but the judge stayed behind as Dustin spoke up. &quot;How can I thank you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to thank me. I&#39;m just doing what was right, but..&quot; He slipped his hand in his pocket and pulled out a business card, adding that to Dustin&#39;s things. &quot;If you need to talk or need help adjusting, give me a call. I might not answer right away, but I&#39;ll always try to call you back.&quot; Judge Loggia excused himself with a, &quot;Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, there&#39;s an irate defendant in the other room I need to have a serious talk with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alone with his new body, Dustin was tempted to explore further, but a camera in the upper corner of the room kept him from doing so. Just standing up was something else. He was suddenly eight inches taller and probably a good sixty pounds heavier, all muscle. His center of gravity felt all off and it took him a moment to feel his balance after months of not walking. He felt heavy... solid... powerful. He went about getting dressed, pulling on underwear and slacks first. It felt strange pulling on another man&#39;s clothes, but they went with this body. He&#39;d need to go shopping, too. get a whole new wardrobe.<br />
<br />
He liked Cody&#39;s looks but not his Guido style, some things would have to change. He pulled on the dress shirt and buttoned up, relishing the way the fabric fell against his new muscles. He&#39;d also need to get a trainer to learn to keep this body. Wouldn&#39;t do to lose all this now that he had it. Rubbing his nipples through his shirt he thought of going to get them pierced. He always wanted to do that, but it just didn&#39;t suit his old scrawny body. The tacky gold chain he just stuck in his pocket along with his personal items, his jacket over his arm, and the court order in hand. <br />
<br />
He strode out of the courthouse a new man, and this time he wasn&#39;t going to waste his younger years.</p>
