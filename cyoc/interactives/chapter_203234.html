<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His welcome back abord the Leviathan was truly a warm one, greeted with praise as he stepped off the monsters corpse and onto the deck, spear in hand, and knife on his belt, his clothing smeared with the beasts blood, but when he stepped aboard, he was immediately swamped, patted on the sholder, hugged, one or two women took a grab at his ass, playfully patting the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I gotta hand it to ya pup, not even a woman is crazy enough to ride a beast of the depths into the ground&quot; came Lanas voice, the crowd parting as she walked over to him, Alex remembering to look her in the eye, despite the temptation her outfit represented, it was then that Lana gave Alex a wicked grin as she pulled her jacket to the side revealing her luscious breasts in all its tanned glory, her nipple standing firm and proud.<br />
<br />
Alex almost choked in shock from her advances, the crew got a kick out of that for sure &quot;awwww look at that, he&#39;s blushing&quot; &quot;trust me boyo ya gonna see allot more than that if ya keep that performance up&quot; &quot;I could do more than show ya that&quot;came the calles from the crew, Lana covered her breast, if only slightly, the pink edge of her nipple still visible and leaned in to his ear &quot;all men in this land want to have their young with strong and beautiful women, I wonder what a few of our own would look like, someone as strong as you with someone like me, I can only imagine&quot; she whispered, her voice like velvet, seductive and enticing.<br />
<br />
Alex was left floundering like a fish for words, Lana then leaped up onto a crate and raised her knife to the sky &quot;the bounty of the sea we set out for is ours ladies!, tonight we celebrate another victory for our ship, our captain, and our fellow hunters present and past!&quot; She yelled &quot;here here!&quot; Came the crews reply as conversation and laughter erupted on deck, the crew funneling down into the lower deck.<br />
<br />
But Alex didn&#39;t follow, even when the music sprung into the air, violins,accordions and guitars filling the dusk air, Alex leaned against the rail, gazing at the giant creature he had helped kill, why had he even engaged it in the first place?, any normal person would have run for cover at such a sight.<br />
<br />
He was so deep in thought he didn&#39;t hear the aproching boots &quot;a hunters first hunt is always the hardest&quot; came a voice, Alex nearly fell overboard in shock, placing his hand on his chest to steady his heart &quot;Jesus why would yo-....captain&quot; he said, straightening up.<br />
<br />
The captain leaned back on the rail, her elbows and back bracing herself up, while both her hands rested on her orb of a stomach, she noticed where Alex&#39;s gaze was and gave a small chuckle &quot;yeah I just stare at it sometimes as well&quot; she said as she petted it&#39;s surface, Alex began to stutter and trip his words, frantically searching for an excuse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, when it&#39;s just us, just call me Liz, or Elizabeth, whichever you prefer, you&#39;ve earned that and more after today, I think we&#39;d be at the bottom of the sea with that beast if you had not been here today&quot; said Liz before she stood up, bracing her hands into the base of her back &quot;walk with me&quot; she said, turning and slowly waddling towards her cabin before Alex could answer, so he simply followed behind her.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Alex closed tha captains cabin door behind him as he watched Liz ease into her chair, As Alex whent to Join her at her desk he took in the room.<br />
<br />
The back of the room was one large stain glass window, the colours of the glass dancing across the room from the evening sun, at each side of the window was a red silk curtain, with white trims around their edges, tied back with thick ropes, the room was divided in two, the half closed to the door lower than the half closest to the window, a step with railings connecting the two, with a wooden rail along from wall to wall, the raised part of the room had what looked like a Chinese style folding screen on its left side, with cranes and lakes in its fabric, there was a chair and rug in the corner, a round side table with a candelabra and a book on its surface, and three hanging wicker baskets with various plants in them on the wall, the captains desk sat in the center, with skulls of silver as the leg stands and draw handles, its surface glass with a small monsters skeleton inside.<br />
<br />
On the right was a type of bedroom, a see-through silk curtain as a barrier for the large king size bed, a monsters horn hanging on the wall, as well as a bedside table and shelf along side the bed, a picture frame turned away from Alex, on the lower half of the room was a large rug infront of the door, it&#39;s design looking like it had come from india, there was a beam above the rooms divide, another skeleton mounted to it, there was a bookshelf to Alexs left, hanging lights above, their red glow casting their warm light on the captains collection of novels, and to his right was a kind of makeup desk and wardrobe, it&#39;s bottom draw still open with a pair of boots and swords in it, but Alex&#39;s attention was once again drawn yo the desk, more accurately what hung above the desk, a large mirror, the mirror he had seen the captain in, the mirror he had come through.<br />
<br />
But Alex walked over to the captains desk and took a seat accross from her as she lit a lamp and placed it on the desk &quot;well then, I think you can guess what it is were here to talk about&quot; said Liz, leaning back and running her hands over her swolen womb,&quot;yeah I think I do.....do they know, you know, how I got here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The captain gave a sigh as she leaned forward, placing her elbows on the desk &quot;lad, if I told them that a man had come through my mirror and when he arrived I swelled up with a babe like filling a watwrskin, they&#39;d throw me overboard for fear I&#39;d gone mad&quot; she did with a chuckle, as she rose and walked over to her screen walking behind it, Alex was confused, until he saw her belt and jacket appear over the top.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how or why it&#39;s happened, but it hasn&#39;t gone away, and it showed up when you did, so mh best guess is that somehow this is yours&quot; she called her bare belly suddenly poking out behind the screen, her hand pointing down at it. &quot;So what would you like me to do captain, I won&#39;t say a word if that&#39;s what you want, if me coming here, which was never my intention has caused you inconvenience or trouble...&quot; suddenly the captain emerged, wearing a flowing black slip gown....that was see-through, her belly and pussy open to the world as her orb parted the fabric, her dark K cups shaded by the dark silk gown.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for saying how you arrived here, well we&#39;ll keep that to ourselves, as far as the crew is concerned I found you stowed away unconcerned beneath my floorboards, and as for this&quot; she said as she gently petted her belly, I&#39;ve been pregnant for a while but I&#39;ve had a really sudden growth spurt&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they bought that?&quot; Said Alex in disbelief, trying desperately to hide his arousal from the captains bare body as she leaned against the desk now on his side, moving her hand in slow circles accros her orb of life &quot;I don&#39;t know, many they didn&#39;t want to press me, or maby they just trust me enough that they just accepted the answers I gave them&quot;<br />
<br />
She then looked up at Alex with a listfull look &quot;and as for what I would have you do, after your actions for my crew and your bravery, il offer you a choice, tonight you can either go celebrate with the crew, or you can have a private celebration here, with me&quot;<br />
