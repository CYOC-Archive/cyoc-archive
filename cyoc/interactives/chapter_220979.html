<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam knew there was nothing he could do. He had used the medallion previously. Once the process had started there was nothing you could do to halt the changes. He would be stuck in the form of the last person who had worn the clothes the medallion had touched. From what Jordan had just told him that was Jordan when she had the athletic blonde body. <br />
<br />
He watched his reflection as he went through reverse puberty. His shoulders narrowed and he lost his bodily hair. Was he losing height as well? Probably. He recalled Jordan had been tall when she was the blonde but not 6’2. He pictured Jordan as the blonde and the sexy blue dress she had worn. It was hard to imagine that he would soon look like that. He was still holding the panties against the medallion. “How long do I need to hold these to the medallion?”<br />
<br />
“Not sure. I just read that the longer the medallion touches the clothes the more instincts cross over. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but it’s worth a try don’t you think?”<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m not sure I want to be your guinea pig as you try out new things” muttered Sam. Damn! His voice was apparently ‘Un-breaking’ <br />
Jordan just giggled but then said “Perhaps just wrap the panties over the chain” <br />
<br />
Sam did so. If he was going to pass as a woman he needed all the instincts he could get. He then glanced back into the mirror. It was getting hard to recognise himself any longer. His now blonde hair was shoulder length. His eyes were now a greyish blue - Part way to the startlingly blue eyes he recalled the blonde had. He looked down at his boxers. He still had a stiff penis but the tent was not as big as previously. He felt for his organ. It was most definitely shrinking. He was embarrassed that he was sexually excited by what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
Jordan giggled once more. “Say goodbye to your little man Samantha” <br />
<br />
“It’s not funny Jordan. You will owe me for this!” Sam was grasping his penis as he felt the still stiff organ contracting. It was now only a couple of inches long. His voice was now that of a kid. He tried to recall what Jordan had sounded like when she was the blonde. “I get to choose your next transformation” <br />
<br />
“Fair enough. But not for this trip. I need to be myself. Like I said Mr Henshaw is expecting Jordan and Samantha to show up tomorrow”<br />
<br />
“Well I’ll just turn you into a puppy or something for the night and change you back in the morning. It would serve you right” Sam checked out his reflection once more. He was apparently undergoing puberty once more. Only this time it was female puberty. His nipples were swelling.<br />
<br />
“You could try but it wouldn’t work. I used the medallion on myself just before I gave it to you. I’m now a freshly showered version of myself. The medallion saves a lot of hot water”<br />
<br />
“Hmmff! Where did you find this body anyway? Who does it really belong to?”<br />
<br />
“It started with a girl trying on jackets at Macy’s when I was in Philadelphia. I made her taller and skinnier though. Don’t worry the chances of anyone knowing her out here are infinitesimal”<br />
<br />
“How do you make someone taller and skinnier?”<br />
<br />
“Help me win this contract and I’ll let you know”<br />
<br />
Sam by now was developing. His breasts were swelling, His hips had widened and his bum was becoming more padded. His penis was a one inch nub. His hair was now down to his hairless armpits. No-one would mistake him for anything but a girl.<br />
<br />
He was also regretting that he had agreed to remain as Samantha for the next three days. He felt sick in the stomach. He didn’t know if he could pull this off. It had been fun been in an athletes body, but this was different. His sex was changed.<br />
<br />
Jordan showed him the contents of the suitcase she had packed for him. <br />
<br />
“I thought you could wear this for tonight when we go out for dinner” she said holding up a floral green dress. She then extacted more clothes meticulously folded to remain creaseless. &quot;This skirt suit will be ideal for the presentation tomorrow and assuming we get a call back on Wednesday I have a navy dress that suits your coloring perfectly”<br />
<br />
“Hang on! You made me into a woman and now you are going to dictate what I wear? What else have you got? I’m not sure I want to wear a dress” Sam realised his voice had changed once more. It was now the rich tones of a young woman. <br />
<br />
“Well we are the same size, so I suppose you could choose something from my suitcase. I did bring along one pair of business slacks”<br />
<br />
“Well yes please! Show me” Same looked in the mirror once more. He was a woman now. His breasts were probably B-cup and still growing. He recognised the athletic blonde. The changes were nearly complete. He waited while Jordan found a pair of beige woman&#39;s slacks from her own suitcase. She showed them to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are welcome to have these. They will fit you. I just think it&#39;s a shame not to show off your legs. They are pretty spectacular&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have the trousers&quot; was Sam&#39;s kurt reply<br />
<br />
“Put this on first” said Jordan handing him a pink bra. It was a match with the panties still wrapped around the medallion which was still around Sam’s neck.<br />
<br />
Sam held the item of clothing in his outstretched hand as if it was toxic. His hand had changed as well. It was feminine with long fingernails.“Do you think it’s safe to take the medallion off yet?”<br />
<br />
“I think so. You are at least 90% there. It’s been over 25 minutes. I think the change is complete in 30. Is there anything left of your old self?”<br />
<br />
Sam looked in the mirror once more. He did not recognise anything of himself in the reflection. He felt his groin. It was flat. “I think you can now legitimately call me Samantha”</p>
