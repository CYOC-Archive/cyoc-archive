<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It's the chronivac.  Somebody stole the chronivac and turned you into a girl&quot;<br />
Female Mark in the car seat beside him was stunned, his mouth open and gasping at the flood of recollections that came forth with Tony mentioning the chronivac.<br />
&quot;Ohmygod.  I remember everything now.  Jeff's chronivac and you and Jack and Eric.  Oh my god.  At least there's a reason for it now.  I-I started changing into a girl in school and I didn't know why or what the hell was going on.  But, um, what the hell *is* going on?  Who did this to me?&quot; said Mark patting his round little breasts.<br />
&quot;Well, it had to be somebody who knew about the chronivac and who could get a hold of it&quot;<br />
&quot;Any ideas?&quot;<br />
&quot;Let's wait till we get home and then try contacting the others&quot; said Tony.<br />
<br />
But when they got home, Jeff was not yet back from the funeral of a family member halfway across the country.  When Tony dialed the number for Jack's family, he got a pizza shop.  He checked the phone book and the Sullivans weren't even listed.  He tried Eric's family, but when he asked for Eric, his mother said that there wasn't any Eric there.  Tony didn't even think to check on Claire.  Why would anyone have gone after her.<br />
<br />
Tony remembered that he'd gotten the chronivac from Jeff and had stored it in the compartment underneath his desk.  So, he and his new sister Mark, tried to make a list of people who'd been in the house at all since that time a few days before.  They came up with a few friends of Mark, Rudy and their family. <br />
<br />
They cast skeptical glances at Cindy.  But in a half hour of talking to her, she didn't betray even the slightest facial expression that would indicate she knew about her brother Mark having been turned into a girl against his will.  She would have laughed uncontrollably at that if she'd known about it.  Marky with girl hips and weak shoulders and little breasts and no . . thing?!  Ahahahahahahahahaha!!<br />
<br />
Mark went out with Tony for a walk.  They went a half mile to the house of one of Mark's friends.  They were trying to figure out how Mark could go in when they saw light through a basement window in the back.  The back yard was at the basement level of that house.  Tony and Mark snuck up to the side of a pool house and looked in.  There were Mark's friends, all gathered around a table.  They were playing Dungeons and Dragons.  Tony shook his head.<br />
&quot;Nobody would play that game if they had the chronivac&quot;<br />
&quot;Let me make sure&quot; said Mark.  <br />
<br />
Mark jogged around to the front of the house and rang the doorbell.  One of the boys' fathers came to the door and smiled at the beautiful girl before him.  He let Mark in and ushered him down to where the boys were in the basement all the while staring at Mark's full female hips and perky little breasts in a way that left no doubt what he was thinking.  He patted Mark's the seat of Mark's girls levis as he closed the door and left.  As Tony watched from outside, Mark approached them one by one, talking to them at close range and scrutinizing each of them intently.  Ten minutes later, he was outside with Tony walking back to their house.  <br />
&quot;It's not any of them.  They didn't even flinch or bat an eyelash.  I mean, they all wanted to fuck me but there wasn't even a hint of knowledge that they'd turned their friend into the object of their lust&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that leaves Rudy&quot; said Tony.  &quot;I remember him being in my room a couple times&quot;<br />
&quot;All I remember is him wanting to be in you&quot; Mark chuckled.<br />
&quot;That's true&quot; Tony sighed &quot;but why would he turn you into a girl.  Why do something to Jack and Eric&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe he wants you and he wants to get everyone else out of the way&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire!  Tony thought of her.  If Rudy had done this and had turned Mark into a girl, what might he have done to Claire?  He ran home Mark falling way behind him, his knockout body not suited to sprinting as his 14 year old male version had been.<br />
<br />
Tony ran up to his room and called Claire's house.  Her mother answered and professed no knowledge of anyone named Claire.<br />
<br />
Tony panicked.  He wanted to run right over to Rudy's house and beat the crap out of him.  Mark, grabbed ahold of Tony and deflected him away from the door and onto his own bed.<br />
&quot;Don't be stupid.  Don't be stupid&quot; Mark grunted to a struggling Tony.  &quot;Plan this out.  He's got a chronivac.  He can turn us into bugs and step on us.  Plan this out!&quot;<br />
Tony relented, which was lucky for Mark because having her little hands all over Tony's rock hard buns was beginning to cause a tingle.  Mark stepped back, away from the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; said Tony.  &quot;Let's watch him closely in school tomorrow&quot;.  Mark sighed and looked down at his round little breasts and slender, hourglass shaped torso.  &quot;Okay.  I can deal with this.  But you have to bring my ipod to school and use it as much as possible.  Your mind is clear when music is playing but not always otherwise&quot;<br />
<br />
The next day, at school, Tony saw that Rudy had something in a second book bag in his locker.  He told Mark about it.  Mark had a study period two periods later at the same time as both Tony and Rudy had one.  They agreed that Tony would keep Rudy occupied and Mark would try and get into the locker and see if that was a chronivac.  <br />
<br />
Come the study period, Tony suggested to Rudy that they go to the library and Rudy enthusiastically agreed.  Tony maneuvered them over to an obscured corner of the library, the part of it that was most distant from the exits.  Immediately, Rudy was all over him, almost literally, leaning on Tony and hugging him with his slender, blond male model body.  Tony played along and laughed at Rudy's jokes.  Rudy rubbed his cheek on Tony's ear as Tony was trying to read a book and Tony did nothing.  Finally, Rudy turned Tony's head and pressed his lips to Tony's.  Tony was repulsed by this jerk who probably attacked his friends wanting to have his way with him but couldn't risk having Rudy walk off in a huff and go to his locker.  He was a strikingly handsome blond boy, but he was also a psycho.  Tony felt Rudy's tongue inside his mouth and couldn't bear any more.  He pushed Rudy's face away.<br />
&quot;What's the matter?&quot; whispered Rudy.<br />
&quot;I-I'm not ready for this&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure you are&quot; chuckled Rudy plunging a hand down the back of Tony's pants.<br />
<br />
Tony couldn't think of any way to say 'no' that wouldn't spark some kind of angry reaction in flighty Rudy.  And Rudy pulled out one iPod earplug making Tony feel oddly receptive to Rudy's advances.  So, he spent another half hour kissing a boy.  It wasn't what Tony wanted, but that wasn't so repellant.  He'd tried gay using the chronivac.  It was the fact that, no matter how gorgeous the boy was, he was a psycho.  And that boy gave Tony's buns a deep tissue message all the while.  Tony felt up Rudy's less impressive little buns out of a feeling of obligation to put on a good show.<br />
<br />
When the bell for the end of that period rang, Tony immediately separated himself from Rudy who gave one last pinch to Tony's ass as Tony gathered his books and started to march quickly out of the library.  &quot;I-I'm not ready for this&quot; Tony stammered to Rudy as they parted and quickly went to Mark's locker.<br />
<br />
There, Mark was crouched with his back to Tony next to his locker frantically typing away at a laptop computer on the floor.  As Tony approached, he saw Mark type rapidly and then finally hit one key and lean back.  From behind, Tony saw Mark's full, female hips narrow and his buns do likewise though they became a little deeper.  He could see Mark's shoulders widening and his shoulder length girl's haircut becoming shorter and shorter till it was the same quarter inch long haircut he had.  He reached Mark and just as he looked around to the front of him, he saw Mark's two perky little breasts flatten and disappear and Mark's nose and jaw resume their former masculine shape.  A moment later, Mark's tight to the point of bursting girl's t-shirt became a larger Clash t-shirt and his jeans became his preferred boy's type.<br />
<br />
He stood up and gave Tony a hug.  His little brother was back.  Tony's first question was about Claire and the others.  What had happened to them?</p>
