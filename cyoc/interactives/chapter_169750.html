<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy looked over to where Grace had gone to lie down, on the north end of what was normally the master bedroom in the Chapman home and curling her tail up and around to the point where Grace as able to rest her head on on the end tip of her tail, almost looking like she was in a perfect circle. Grace hadn&#39;t exhibited any aggression or any sign that she&#39;d fallen into the same state that their mother had fallen into when she transformed, but a good part of Lucy&#39;s mind wondered if this was merely a change in tactics. After all, Grace had stated that all Slug People were connected to some kind of hive mind. Megan and Jenny had to have known that their initial plans failed and thus were changing tactics, and with Grace now transformed, a new plan could be formed and Grace could be in on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t trust her,&quot; came Jeff&#39;s voice from behind her, making Lucy turn around to see her brother kneeling beside her. He looked a bit uncomfortable, but then some of that could be the result of all the crazy stuff that had gone on in the course of the evening that had left them all naked and in their mother&#39;s bedroom while their mother and youngest sister had undergone radical transformations into Slug Women. The claim that Jeff was the one responsible for Grace&#39;s full transformation was probably part of it to, Jeff wasn&#39;t necessarily the smartest one in the family, but in many ways he was often the one had the most care and compassion, at least outside of their mother when she wasn&#39;t wanting to rape them. Lucy expected her brother to feel guilty after being told that he was the one that gave Grace the added encouragement to transform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I, Jeff?&quot; Lucy whispered back, unsure as to how good Grace&#39;s hearing was now, &quot;Should I really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has told us what Megan and Jenny&#39;s plan is... or at least was,&quot; Jeff pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s also said there is no way we can avoid becoming Slug People, either, which would seem to be Megan and Jenny&#39;s goal,&quot; Lucy answered, &quot;that we all turn into horny Slug People and start a hive with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a heavy sigh at that comment. It was something that reflected a lot of what he knew about Lucy&#39;s personality and he knew that what Megan and Jenny had done with their spells to try and turn them and done successfully with their mother was something that would irritate and frighten his twin sister. After all, she lived to be herself and wasn&#39;t the sort to just let anyone control her, regardless of who they were or how. The sort of mind-control haze that they&#39;d been under when Megan and Jenny first came to the house and that they broke out of when their mother began to transform was something that Lucy would be suspicious of.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said we can&#39;t avoid becoming Slug People,&quot; Jeff admitted, &quot;but she didn&#39;t say we should just join with Megan and Jenny. In fact she did tell us about them focusing on some &quot;master&quot; and agreed on wanting to find a way to avoid that master...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if that master is some kind of god or goddess for Slug People?&quot; Zoe asked from the other side of Lucy, glancing her eyes to Grace and noting that Grace was seeming to drift off to sleep before looking back to her older siblings.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the records and stories would indicate that Slug People were created by Human witches and warlocks,&quot; Jeff reminded them, &quot;and given all that we&#39;ve seen here this evening and tonight... I&#39;d think we can accept that magic is real, and that would mean that whoever this &quot;master&quot; is, he or she is likely Human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I agree there,&quot; Lucy nodded, &quot;but if he or she has cast this mind control spell on Megan and Jenny and through them on us... how do we know we&#39;re fully free of it? How do we know that Grace didn&#39;t become controlled by it the way mom has? She&#39;s even admitted that some things are different... and I&#39;m not just talking about her physical appearance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Grace, as far as her personality goes, hasn&#39;t changed,&quot; Jeff reminded her, &quot;yes, she transformed... but unlike mom, she didn&#39;t immediately get horny and urge us to mate with her. She&#39;s talked about us being separate from Megan and Jenny and their &quot;master.&quot; She&#39;s shared a lot about what their plan was/is and explained on how Slug People operate... all of which she didn&#39;t have to, and has managed to explain it in a way that reflects all the science courses and interest she&#39;s had over the years. So I wouldn&#39;t think she&#39;d be deliberately deceiving us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you know?&quot; Lucy asked to Jeff with her eyes focused, &quot;we&#39;re trapped in here... WITH her and she could easily be hiding things. Waiting for us to go to sleep and then covering us while we sleep and then turning us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I don&#39;t think she could fully hide any deception,&quot; Jeff answered, &quot;Megan and Jenny really couldn&#39;t... as their entire method relied on us not noticing the spell or breaking its hold on us. Thus they made little to no effort to hide their intentions. Thus why they got horny and openly displayed that around us as part of whatever plan to get us to turn. And they got mom to turn first, but that snapped us out of it. If Grace were still under their control or their master&#39;s control... I don&#39;t think Grace would have been able to hide it all that well. There would be some voicing of a desire to have sex or she would be visibly aroused even more while explaining things. And neither would she say that she&#39;d only accelerate our changes if we say we want her to... for that would get in the way of whatever the full plan was. She wouldn&#39;t reveal as much as she knew about this plan either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think she&#39;s free?&quot; Lucy asked, and glanced over to Grace and noted that Grace did seem to be clearly asleep with her head on her tail and eye stalks resting downward with the eyelids that she hadn&#39;t lost in her transformation closed, &quot;Mentally, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jeff assured his twin sister, &quot;I don&#39;t think that Megan or Jenny... or this master are controlling her or us. She may be right in that we&#39;ll all eventually become Slug People thanks to the spells that Megan and Jenny cast when they first came in... but I doubt she&#39;s under their control. And in this, I doubt that any of us are either... including you, Lucy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I change?&quot; Lucy asked, her voice a bit nervous and giving a visible shudder. Jeff responded by putting a warm hand on her shoulder, and that gave her a sense of comfort that was reassuring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if and when we change,&quot; Jeff promised, &quot;I don&#39;t know much about magic... and I don&#39;t even know how I enhanced the spell that turned Grace, but a lot of tonight&#39;s events would probably prove how wrong we were on magic... even if it&#39;s hard for us to accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that again,&quot; both Zoe and Lucy nodded.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded in agreement, &quot;but my hunch is that Grace was speaking the truth that the magic Slug People have and naturally use isn&#39;t that powerful... more inherent and defensive than being able to overpower a sentient and strong mind. Thus when we recognized that mom was starting to become a Slug Woman too, that mind control spell was broken on all of us, and likely meaning that it was coming from this master of theirs. They only got mom because she got to the point where her transformation physically manifested and she couldn&#39;t break free of the mind control spell while transforming. We did break the mind control spell and that has us free... and in that, while the transformation spell may be affecting us... it won&#39;t really effect our minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy breathed a sigh of relief at that and then nodded to Jeff. She wasn&#39;t excited by the fact that she was eventually going to become an anthropomorphic Slug  of some species of Slug... but the assurance that she would still be Lucy Chapman and not some mindless or simply lust filled Slug with no other interests was helpful. And if Jeff was sure that Grace wouldn&#39;t pull any tricks, a part of her also felt that she could trust him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Lucy whispered at last, &quot;though we&#39;d best get some sleep... as it&#39;s late, we&#39;re all tired and there&#39;s still the issue of finding a way to free mom and getting away from Megan and Jenny that doesn&#39;t leave us trapped in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded in agreement and went down to lay on the floor underneath the window on the southern side of the room. Lucy lay back down on the bed and rolled onto her side before trying to drive off to sleep as well After what seemed like forever... her eyes did drift shut and she went to sleep.</p>
