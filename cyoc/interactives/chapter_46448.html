<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin sat at the back of the room and listened as Mister Martez talked endlessly something about genes. In truth, Justin was rather bored and rather preoccupied at the time and could care less about the subject. If push came to shove, coach would set in and bully the teacher into giving Justin a passing grade.<br />
<br />
&quot;After all,&quot; Justin thought. &quot;I am the captain of both the wrestling and football teams.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, a passing grade wasn't really what his problem was and why he was bored and rather preoccupied. His problem was actually his mother...a strict and rather old fashioned woman who demanded complete obedience from not only Justin and his twin sister, but also the from the hired help that cleaned their house.<br />
<br />
Justin's problem had started about a week ago when his friend...Matt, who was also the quarterback...had loaned him a magazine. Shortly after that, Justin's mother had caught him masturbating to a centerfold picture in the magazine.<br />
<br />
Taking it away, his mother had told him, &quot;Woman are not to be ogled at like that. Nor are they to shamelessly flaunt and have their bodies photographed. Don't let me catch you doing what I caught you doing again or there will be consequences for it,&quot; and with that said, she left the room.<br />
<br />
Justin didn't see the magazine anymore and assumed his mother had destroyed it. So, he thought of different ways to look at naked photos without his mother catching on. And in the process of trying to think of a good place to do this, he had found a hole in one of the walls and that the hole looked on into one of the younger maid's rooms.<br />
<br />
And three days ago, Justin had watched as the maid undressed. As she did this, Justin began to self-pleasure himself...only to be discovered by his mother.<br />
<br />
At first she did not say anything, just looked at him. And then, with pursed lips, she said, &quot;You will be punished for this. Mark my words.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the punishment didn't come and Justin thought she might have forgotten. But she hadn't forgotten. For this morning, she had awoken him with the words, &quot;Get up,&quot; and &quot;Undress&quot;.<br />
<br />
Confused, he lay there for a minute and then she had told him, &quot;Get up and get undressed. Do not make me tell you a third time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bothered by this, Justin climbed out of bed and then slowly took off the boxers he worn to bed. Looking at his mother, he saw her nod and then she made a follow me gesture and stepped out of his room.<br />
<br />
Scared, Justin followed and almost started to protest when he saw that she was leading him toward his sister's room, but instead choose to remain silent. Behind his mother by a couple steps, Justin watched silently as she opened the door and then made a motion for him to step in.<br />
<br />
Walking into the room, he was suddenly aware of both his sister and the maid he had been masturbating to standing in the center of the room. Looking down at the carpet, he head his mother first enter the room, close the door and then she began to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the old days, when a childe needed to be chastised, there where ways. Oh, yes. There where ways. But, sadly, most of those ways are now considered abuse. However, there is another way for the punishment to be carried out. Especially for a naughty boy who cannot seem to stop ogling woman. This old way is called petticoating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking up at his mother, Justin tried to protest but his mother hissed a warning at him and then looking at his sister, she said, &quot;Amanda. Go to you dresser and pick from it one of most uncomfortable bras. Next, choose a pair of underwear and a pair of socks. Make sure that there can be no mistake that the socks belong to a female. It is time for your brother to learn something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin watched her walk silently toward her dresser and as she opened the top drawer, their mother said, &quot;Emily. I want you to find me a maid's outfit that will fit my son. On Saturday and Sunday he shall be joining you are you clean the house. And if he does not cooperate, then his punishment will also include the next weekend after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The maid nods at this and Justin's mother continues as Amanda hands Justin the undergarments from her dresser. &quot;Justin, on Saturday and Sunday, you shall be treated like a girl. You shall act like a girl. You will be addressed by a girl's name and you will be expected to answer to this name. If errands need to be run, you shall do so with Emily and do so dressed like a girl. And in the community, you shall compose yourself and act like a girl...that even means using the girl's toilet if need be. Am I clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Justin muttered, &quot;Yes ma'am,&quot; as he looked at the thong, pink socks and tight looking bra that one could clearly make out the under wire on.<br />
<br />
Now, fifth period science, Justin was attempting to come with a good explanation to his coach when he was interrupted from his thoughts as he flipped through the science book and noticed that someone had folded a note up inside. Taking the note out, he unfolded it and read:<br />
<br />
'Justin...<br />
<br />
Your wish for a way out of your situation is about to come true. Just imagine that you could change something about your life...anything, no matter how large or small. Maybe something to do with your body? The people you know? Perhaps the world around you? And the best part about all this is that you will be the only one who is not oblivious to the change. The world and everyone in it will exist as if what's been changed has always been that way.<br />
<br />
Write your wish below and try to enjoy yourself. Feel free to make the wish as detailed as you want. Unsatisfied with your wish? Just rip up this paper to undo the change and return your life. Note: You are granted only this one wish, so try to be careful in your wishing.'<br />
<br />
Chuckling, Justin dropped the note back onto the page and thought, &quot;What a lame joke,&quot; and looked up at the clock.<br />
<br />
Noting that there was still about half an hour left of class, Justin idly began to tap his finger on the science book. After a bit, his eyes drifted back to the note and what was written there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not,&quot; Justin reasoned. &quot;It could help me out of my bind.&quot; And with that thought in mind he picked up his pencil.<br />
<br />
Pulling the note closer, he reread it and then after a bit he wrote down: 'I wish that coach and everyone that knows me thinks it is normal and accepts the fact that I am wearing my sister's undergarments. In fact, they are actually mine and I wear them normally and this is okay. Even my mom knows this and accepts it because is okay. Sometimes, I come to practice dressed in more than just female undergarments and this okay, because it is perfectly normal.'<br />
<br />
Justin paused and looked at what he had written, chuckled silently to himself, thought, &quot;I can't believe that I am taking this seriously,&quot; and then continued to write.<br />
<br />
'Even the help at home thinks it is normal, because sometimes I dress like Emily and help her in cleaning. Everything about the fact that I wear female clothes is normal and acceptable and today I will go to the after school meet, coach will see the undergarments I am wearing but shan't say anything. In fact, it will be so normal that I will be asked out by a very cute someone after practice and I'll except.'<br />
<br />
Looking at what he had written, thinking of Nadine...the cute girl in his homeroom class...Justin smiled, adjusted himself as the thong he was wearing inched further into his butt crack and tightened closer to his testicles and then folded up the note.</p>
