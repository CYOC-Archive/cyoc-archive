<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate said goodbye to his parents and then dashed out the door just as quickly as Eric had earlier. He jumped into the backseat of Ben’s jeep, and then the three were off. In the house next door, Samantha and Frances were continuing their mewing in unison. The boys pretended not to hear anything as they drove past the Twist house, Ben in particular.  <br />
<br />
“I’m not crashing some kind of date am I?” Nate asked, settling into his seat. <br />
<br />
“No way. Just wanted to share in the fun.” Alex turned around in his own seat to grin at Nate. <br />
<br />
“Ya, a word of caution, Alex gets a little nuts when it comes to partying.” Ben said. <br />
<br />
“Seriously? I never took you for a party animal Alex. You been holding back a little at the pack meetings?” <br />
<br />
“Oh those are a different kind of party. I’m talking about real parties. You know, ones where everyone keeps their clothing on.” Alex gave Ben a knowing look, to which Ben rolled his eyes. <br />
<br />
“So, Eric at Spencer’s place again?” Ben asked. Nate nodded. <br />
<br />
“What kind of were do you think Eric is going to choose? You said he was considering one of the big cats right?” Alex looked at Ben, who had talked to Eric after the football game. The conversation moved from baseball to “getting around the bases” (wink). <br />
<br />
“I think he’s really leaning towards panther, you know something compatible with Spencer in that regard. And something that’s pretty versatile as far as climate goes.”<br />
<br />
“Huh, I never thought about the climate stuff. Guess it would be kind of inconvenient to become something like a lion or cheetah.” Alex mused. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Nate was coming to a realization of his own. Eric asking so many questions about Kenya’s family tree and the like. Eric wanted to make sure Kenya didn’t have any domestic cat in her genetics. Because if she did, then like Maggie Lawson, any normal she changed was at risk for becoming a gay or bi werecat. <br />
<br />
“He wants Kenya to be the one to do IT? Does Spencer know? She has to. But… wouldn’t Eric want his girlfriend to be the one to take his…”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Nate did you hear what I said?” Ben interrupts Nate’s thoughts. <br />
<br />
“What? Oh no, sorry.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“I know it’s early, but do you want to grab something to eat before the concert? You’ve never been to a Dick’s Drive-In yet have you?” Ben asked. <br />
<br />
“No, but I’ve heard it’s really good.” <br />
<br />
“You heard right.” Ben went on to rave about the place. He wouldn’t stop until the finally got to Seattle. Half an hour of Ben raving about hamburgers and milkshakes. Alex and Nate were glad when Ben finally stopped. Not that they didn’t enjoy his impromptu culinary review. <br />
<br />
“Geez, is he always this passionate about this kind of stuff?” Nate asked. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. I guess. I just tune him out. Only fair, since Ben does he same to me when I start talking about doctor things.” Alex said. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, kind of like me in math class.” <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
Several burgers later, and Nate, Ben and Alex were heading to a park about ten minutes from the concert venue. There, Nate saw a large group of teenagers having a cookout. <br />
<br />
“Ben! Glad you could make it!” <br />
<br />
A tall, dark haired guy emerges from the crowd waving a spatula over his head. He has thick black eyebrows over his green eyes. His teeth are a brilliant white, almost too perfect. The guy could be a male model if he wanted. Nate couldn’t tell what kind of were he was though, only that the guy was one. His scent was canine that much Nate could tell. <br />
<br />
“Hey Asar! You started without us?” Ben says with an equally big smile. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, but you snooze you lose.” <br />
<br />
“Right. Anyway, you remember Alex? And this is my next door neighbor Nate. His family moved to Moon Lake last June. Nate, Asar David. His family used to live in Moon Lake.” Ben introduces Nate. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Likewise. Too bad you and your folks didn’t move to town sooner, might have gone to school for a few years.” Asar shakes Nate’s hand. <br />
<br />
“I’ll let you two get acquainted. Gonna go find me something to eat!” Ben smiled as he ran off into the crowd. <br />
<br />
“What the hell man, you just ate!?” Alex chased after Ben with a disapproving look. Nate laughed before turning back around to ask Asar what kind of were he was. <br />
<br />
“Jackal. Third generation. What about you? Born into this?” <br />
<br />
“I wish. No, we moved from Minnesota because of my dad’s job.” <br />
<br />
“Same with me. Mom got a job upgrade in the big city. And with both me and my sister going off to college, she decided a pay raise was worth relocating.”<br />
<br />
Asar pointed out an exotic, olive skinned girl in the crowd laughing with a group of girls. Her black hair waved down to the middle of her back. One of her friends noticed Asar waving, and she waved back. <br />
<br />
“So that’s her?” Nate couldn’t help but admire the girl. She didn’t look like she was high school aged. She seemed much more mature. From the way she stood, to the way she smiled at the two. <br />
<br />
“Yep, Skylar.” Asar said. He noticed how the werewolf was checking out his sister. Asar didn’t mind, in fact he was used to it. Besides, Skylar was more than capable of taking care of herself. When the two were little, she had no problem proving she was the dominant sibling. <br />
<br />
“Anyway, just kick, back and relax. Everyone here either is a were, or knows about them. Just don’t wolf out on anyone.” Asar winked before running off to join the crowd. Nate nodded, and looked around at everyone else having a good time. And Nate was about to as well when someone caught his eye across the street. <br />
<br />
“Nate?” Alex watched as Nate exited the park and walked across the street. And then Alex saw why. He’d only met Kenya in passing, but he’d recognize her anywhere. She stood out in a crowd, even in plain clothes.</p>
