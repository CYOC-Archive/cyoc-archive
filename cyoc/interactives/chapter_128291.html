<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Opening his eyes slowly, Seph felt his skull pound in pain causing him to rub it and hope it calmed down. When the pain finally did so, He saw, that instead of being in his bedroom in front of his computer he was in what looked to be a barren wasteland. As well as the obvious scene change Seph also noticed that he had an incredibly hard boner at the moment of all things. Instead of panicking like he would have normally done so though, his body seemed to keep calm as though being forced even though he knew he shouldn’t. Looking around more, Seph was surprised to see a red small winged creature wearing only a leather loincloth and holding a small empty vial.<br />
“I’m surprised human, the last champion who came through was already sucking away hungrily at my co-”<br />
The demon didn’t have a chance to finish what it had been saying though as Seph took action by kicking the small creature away.<br />
“Gahh, you may have one this round human but never forget the name Zetaz as I will soon make you bow to my cock one day.”<br />
With that, the small imp took flight into the barren wasteland skies leaving Seph alone to question where he was.<br />
‘I remember being at my desk getting ready to play that weird game then everything went black...don’t tell me i’m somehow inside the game now!’<br />
Seph’s frantic thoughts soon calmed down though.<br />
‘Easy Seph, easy. Everything will be alright, this is obviously just a dream and when I wake up everything will be alright again.’<br />
“If by alright, you mean alone to just sit around a computer playing games to hide away from reality then yes everything will be alright.”<br />
Quickly getting to his feet, Seph looked to see who had spoken in such a deep and ominous voice.<br />
“Don’t bother looking for me, i’m not really there and don’t bother thinking about going home either. I brought you here because you were the perfect candidate to entertain me.”<br />
“Entertain you, what the hell do you mean by that?”<br />
“When someone such as me becomes bored we sometimes pluck small and useless individuals from their worlds and place them somewhere else to entertain ourselves with their antics of rebellion or acceptance of their fate. You though are lucky, I know this world like the back of my hand and was ever so generous to leave you as you had selected to play your silly little game including the changes you made to the setting but be warned though, this world is not a game, if you die here, you stay dead and I simply find someone else to entertain me. Until we speak again, ta ta.”<br />
Unsure whether or not to actually believe the voice Seph still didn’t know what to do now. With no other option, he started to walk in one random direction and hope for the best. After hours of walking, Seph started to become thirsty but no water was in sight. Still going, he soon started to see what looked to be a camp in the distance. Not caring if he was in a dream or not and only wanting to sate his thirst, Seph started to run as fast as his tired legs could carry him until he finally reached the outskirts of the camp. Before he could take another step though, a jagged blade appeared from nowhere to appear under his chin.<br />
“Well lookie who I have here, some human who apparently thinks running up to some strange campsite is a good idea.”<br />
Glancing to his side to see who was speaking, Seph was blown away to see that the person was not human but rather some kind of werewolf. The wolfman was black in color with shaggy hair, gleaming sharp white teeth, and one good eye while the other appeared to be blind with a scar over it.<br />
“W-water.”<br />
Seph’s parched throat made his voice sound like a whisper but it was still understandable thankfully for Seph.<br />
“You must be a new champion to think that everyone here is nice and dandy. Probably slacked off in Ingam too much to actually know anything.”<br />
Remembering the backstory for the games lore and where all champions come from, Seph realized that this wolf person must have been from there somehow.<br />
“You’re from Ignam?”<br />
“Of course I am, otherwise you would be on your knees while I shoved my dick down your throat.”<br />
With that, the older champion put away his sword before beckoning Seph to follow him to his campfire and sitting down. Pulling out a large canteen, the wolf man handed it to Seph.<br />
“Best drink up while you can, regular water is hard to come by here luckily a wizard friend of mine was able to make this little trinket to help with that. Put any liquid in and boom, instant fresh water.”<br />
Taking the canteen with a whispered thanks, Seph guzzled down as much as he could before stopping to breath. Once finished, Seph was left with burning questions to ask, questions that the wolf man already knew.<br />
“The name’s wulf-rick by the way and like you, I was chosen to be the champion and save mareth didn’t work out so well though. I slayed hundreds of demons and even stopped the sandwitches from attacking every person they met but all I have to show for it is some twisted form that barely resembles my old one and enough experience to kill any demon I meet.”<br />
“So does that mean you gave up.”<br />
Not expecting such a sudden question from Seph, Wulf-rick simply starred before answering.<br />
“I guess I have, Been thinking about moving out of this came to and live with a friend of mine to help her rebuild her church but was never sure if I should or not.”<br />
“I guess that means you’re sure now?”<br />
“Yep I guess it does.”<br />
Standing up, Wulf-rick gave a quick stretch before pulling Seph to his feet and shaking his hand with a smile a very deadly looking smile.<br />
“Hate to cut our meeting short Seph but I have a friend who needs my help.”<br />
With that said, Wulf-rick picked up his bag before walking off into the distance but not before shouting one last thing.<br />
“Keep the camp, nothing there but memories I want to forget.”<br />
Turning his head to look at the well made camp, Seph soon looked back to see that Wulf-rick was now gone from sight in all directions. Unsure what to do now, Seph picked up the left behind canteen and gave it a quick shake to find that it was no less full then when he had started drinking. Untwisting the lid, Seph took one last gulp before checking out his new home.</p>
