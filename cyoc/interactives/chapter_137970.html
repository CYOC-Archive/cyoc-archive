<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff felt his stomach start to ache, making him feel as if one of his organs was going to explode. He cradled his arm on his stomach Reaching onto the pain. He then had the feeling his body begin to shift causing him to drop to the floor. The pain continued downwards as it reached critical pain in his pelvic region. His body heated up causing him to sweat uncontrollably. He writhed in pain on the floor scratching and clawing the floor as his body began to make sounds loud and furiously almost like Hell was literally burning inside him. He then felt his butt began to expand which he watched it contort and mold inside his pants. The only thing that he could think about now he knew the Chronivac wasn&#39;t dicking around when it said it would replace his ass with a dinosaur&#39;s head. It was, however, too late to turn back now since he had a dinosaur&#39;s head growing inside his pants. He felt the head try to burst through his pants, but without any progress. He felt the head begin to build up as it grew inside his pants as he felt like rooting for it so the pain would pass. It finally burst through his pants like a worm popping his head out of the ground, ripping them open just enough for the head to fit through and still be able to hold them in place. Jeff was still shaking with fear and terror when the pain subsided. Still on the ground and on his stomach he bravely cocked his head back slowly to look what the machine did to him. There was a long blue dinosaur neck connected to where his butt would be, as he stared at it deeply he went to think about the scene in Jurassic Park where they first see the dinosaurs, but without that much baroque. In fact this made Jeff afraid, giving a sudden feel of anxiety over his thoughts. It had a dark blue back with spinal ridges edging up to it&#39;s head. It wasn&#39;t actual size (thank God) but it was tall enough to reach Jeff&#39;s eye level. As he discovered by looking under his pants, that he had no butt cheeks left, except the dinosaurs neck was based around his bottom. He was startled when the head began to move on it&#39;s own as it started to look around his room. Which gazed it&#39;s yellow eyes towards his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; It said with a nice soft feminine voice. She looked down at where her neck stuck out of Jeff&#39;s ass. &quot;It looks like I&#39;m connected to you. I guess this isn&#39;t the worst transformation ever.&quot; She giggled which made him seem a little sorry for her. &quot;But you seem like a cute guy, so it isn&#39;t gonna bother me that I&#39;ll be your new butt. I&#39;ve never seen a creature like you before, what may I ask do you call yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, this is weird.&quot; He muttered. Still a little shocked at this sight he wasn&#39;t able to move, also for the fact that she could talk. She then pulled her neck closer to him giving her a better look at her new &#39;body&#39;. &quot;Your skin seems different.&quot; She looked and then rubbed her cheek on his cheek. &quot;Hmm, so soft. Not rough like mine. I see that you&#39;re frightened,&quot; She looked at Jeff&#39;s frightened expression on his face. &quot;Isn&#39;t this what you wanted, to have a dinosaur like me as your ass. I wouldn&#39;t bite you, if that what you think. Why would I bite something that&#39;s apart of me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just, I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot; Jeff fought the courage to speak back to her again. &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s weird, well by being my butt by proxy?&quot; She started to sulk as he went on. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong you look beautiful for an Apatosaurus, which happens to be my favorite dinosaur, but I wasn&#39;t expecting this thing to work. I thought it was some sort of fetish device for people with a sick mind to draw a story in their minds. This wasn&#39;t even my fetish. This was a weird little experiment gone wrong.&quot; He commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t like me?&quot; She began to sob with her head pointed down, somehow forming tears down her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t mean that. I just don&#39;t know what to do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can keep me.&quot; She looked up back at you with an unwavering stare. &quot;You seem like a nice, uh dinosaur. I&#39;m not going to delete you or anything. So maybe I&#39;ll try out how this works and all.&quot; She shot back up with excitement in her eyes and swung her head to kiss him on the cheek. &quot;Thank you. I&#39;ll try to be a good little tush.&quot; She smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just feel bad leaving you like it is. You do know what you&#39;re used for, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. I once had a big butt myself which I used it pretty much everyday. Now it&#39;s time for me to be one, which I don&#39;t mind doing the regular everyday. Plus you&#39;re so goddamn cute, I wouldn&#39;t have it any way, unless you want to change things. Oh, I almost forgot since I&#39;m part of the Chronovac&#39;s program, do you want me to be &#39;the master&#39; or &#39;the pet?&#39;&quot; She looked back at Jeff who seemed a little confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don&#39;t see why we can be either. All I want to be is friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I can work with that. So we&#39;re friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh what was it like in back where you lived?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh well, I&#39;m not necessarily from where dinosaurs lived, meaning I&#39;m not real dinosaur. The machine runs simulations for many different situations, I was with dinosaurs. We all were programmed which was composed of different coding for how we lived and what we did to interact with it. I have a memory of a dinosaur, but with some humanistic attributes that leaked into the database by the people who created the machine. I&#39;m fully aware of everything and anything. Also I&#39;m pretty smart at anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I want to know is, what happened to my actual ass, is it on your digital body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a lot more complicated than that. I would believe it&#39;s somewhere stored in it&#39;s drive. I&#39;m sure nothing will become of it. I remember you asked about me being deleted, which isn&#39;t entirely true. If you want to change back, I&#39;ll go back to my environment. Plus, my body isn&#39;t just lying in the simulation, my body actually is merged and acts as your body, if that makes sense?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s weird to think about. Your body is like part of my body. Anyway, I&#39;d like to check us out in the mirror.&quot; Jeff ran and jumped in front of his closet door, making the dinosaur head sort of bobble with his body. The door being wide open they both checked each other out in the mirror. &quot;Is that me?&quot; The dinosaur head wondered looking closely into her reflection. &quot;I look amazing! I was never able to see what I looked like until now. You look pretty good too, now that I can see your whole body.&quot; She said not taking her eyes off the mirror. She then looked at Jeff&#39;s reflection, &quot;I guess you must be my tail.&quot; She giggled making Jeff even more crazy about her. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Jeff, I&#39;m a human if you&#39;re wondering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Jeff the human you can call me what ever you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really, you want me to name you? Okay how about Amy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sounds like a name I&#39;d have. So what would you like to do now?&quot; She questioned Jeff who got to thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see down your throat?&quot; She opened her mouth up without question looking more seductive. Jeff stared down what he knew was his anus. She had a whitish fleshy tongue which flopped around some collecting saliva. &quot;I don&#39;t know what made me want to, but I wanted to see what my new anus looked like.&quot; She closed her mouth looking back at Jeff with a dorky smile. &quot;I hoped you enjoyed it? And you know what, I can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s it like filling my mouth up with your poop.&quot; They both laughed, making Jeff more comfortable with Amy attached to him by the hip. &quot;So what do you want to do now that you know what the Chronivac can do?&quot;</p>
