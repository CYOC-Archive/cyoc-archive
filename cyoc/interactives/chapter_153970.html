<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So then it was a load of books about plants, and trees. Herbs. All that kind of stuff. Interesting in a way, but not useful...&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry followed the swishing tail of his red-headed daughter as she walked in front of him. Several weeks without talking and now, it seemed, she was letting it all out at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;...eventually I found some folklore books and I thought &#39;Jackpot Jess&#39; this just *has* to have something about this cabin in it. But again, no dice.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was happy really that his daughter was back talking, and in an obvious good mood. What Henry more struggled with was that her good mood had been prefaced, and begun by him throwing all conventions, laws, and practices of parenthood; throwing them away, and having sex with his own teenage daughter. He felt ill with himself. Especially because he had liked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;...it was a load of fairytales, sure. Plenty magic, castles, dragons, princesses...&quot; She paused at that one and turned profile to look back at Henry. Her dungarees clung tightly to her chest. The added flesh of her burgeoning udder helped fill-up the inside of her dungaree. It made it look like she had a little bit of pudge to go with her heaving chest. The straps, now under serious strain, dug into her shoulder. It must have hurt, but she gave him a wide smile all the same.<br />
<br />
Henry stiffened and shifted slightly to keep his body aligned directly at her. He stiffened, because he was trying to hide the cow&#39;s tail he&#39;d hastily stuffed down his pants.<br />
<br />
She held the look for a moment longer before continuing. &quot;...fairly good stories in all. But had nothing to do with this place. I was getting fairly well fed-up of this place and then I found...&quot; <br />
<br />
She paused for a moment, stopping in front of one of the book-cases. Spinning to face her father, smile, and with a flourish, knock on the wooden wall.<br />
<br />
*Thunk-thunk*<br />
<br />
&quot;This!&quot; she beamed.<br />
<br />
Henry arched an eyebrow, and gave her a skeptical look. Jess&#39;s smile fell and she gave him an incredulous look.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hollow dad!&quot; The sing-song dipthong in the word Da-d hurt. It was the same as she had always said it when he teased her growing up. <br />
<br />
It reminded Henry again that he&#39;d fucked his own daughter out of lust. <br />
<br />
His tail twitched in his pants; and now he had to pay the price. His distraction was noticed by Jess, who knocked around the wall to demonstrate the patch that was hollow, compared to the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hollow here Dad, and nowhere else. If there&#39;s something hidden, something that might explain what&#39;s going on, it has to be in this hollow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Jess.&quot; Henry could see where this was going. She&#39;d want him to break open the wall. A physical activity, during which she was liable to notice a bulge in the back of his pants.<br />
<br />
He began to sweat, Henry really needed to get out of here. Jess, however didn&#39;t want to let up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me Dad! There has to be something here, just bust it open and we&#39;ll know. It&#39;s not like anyone is coming back to a <br />
 cursed Cabin, we know no-one lives here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry held his hand-up, an excuse forming in his mind. &quot;I&#39;m with you Jess. But I don&#39;t want to break walls for no reason, what if it&#39;s a load-bearing wall?&quot; He knew it wasn&#39;t, but seeing Jess un-tense a little, with a dissapointed look told him she didn&#39;t know that. <br />
<br />
He continued. &quot;I&#39;ll have a look, check a few things. I promise you Jessie, if it can be opened, I&#39;ll open it first thing tomorrow.&quot; The relaxation of her set stance and jaw, told Henry he had won. &quot;Look sweetie.&quot; He felt ill saying that. &quot;It&#39;s been a long day so far. I&#39;m tired from chopping. I need a lie-down.&quot;<br />
<br />
He began to back out of the room, Jess looked disappointed, mouth curling down at the side. With a *Ppffftt* she blew stray bangs from her <br />
 face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Okay. Tomorrow though Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry continued to back away. At the threshold of the door, Jess piped up again; voice smaller, more timid.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad it was you Dad, not some stray horse or dog or something...for my first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry&#39;s heart broke. He felt glad, sick, horny, regretful, proud... a whirlwind of emotions. He muttered an unintigible response, to which Jess replied again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... Thanks Dad...&quot;<br />
<br />
He disappeared from the doorway.<br />
<br />
Jess left out a long sigh, hand dropping to her dungaree pocket. Rooting around in the pocket with the cut hole, her fingers came in contact with her slick pussy. A quick swipe collected a strand of juice mixed with cum. Bringing the hand back to her face she marvelled at the strings playing between her fingers.<br />
<br />
Sex had been amazing. Way better than she could have imagined, and the poughing she recieved on all fours was still ringing in her mind. Part of her screamed to do that again, and again, and again, feel everything jiggle, be ridden like an animal. Like a breeding cow.<br />
<br />
The thought was quickly banished with venom. This place wouldn&#39;t get her that easy. Jess brushed her cum stained hand off her pants and <br />
 turned to the bookcase.<br />
<br />
With an exasparated sigh she grabbed a random book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well do something till tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Henry&#39;s mind was a whir as he entered the master bedroom. He had a plan, he had to deal with the tail situation with Joan somehow. Coming out straight away was off the table for him. Even if Joan had been distant, and fixated on getting him to join her as a goat.<br />
<br />
Luckily for him, she&#39;d been so goaty smellling in the last two weeks, that he&#39;d found it easy to avoid feeling super horny around her. What he saw when he entered the bedroom, he was not prepared for.<br />
<br />
Joan lay, buck naked, on a bed of roses. The room smelled heavenly. Almost instantly, blood began to flow to his nethers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joan had spent her time, post witnessing her husband fuck her daughter, plotting.<br />
<br />
Step one in her plan was to put on a show, and get Henry to cum a few times before he could reveal his change.<br />
<br />
Enticing him to become a goat hadn&#39;t worked, so she dispensed with the pheremonal attack, and had thoroughly showered, scrubbing, lathering and scenting herself up to cover any animal smell. She&#39;d also doused the room in liberal amounts of perfume.<br />
<br />
Draped naked on the bed, tits, crotch-boobs, heavy testicles and chubby limp dick, all hanging to the force of gravity; she smiled wickedly as she saw his eyes bulge.<br />
<br />
Before he could say anything, she rose, both pairs of breasts and her balls falling and slapping her body, and she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk honey. You shouldn&#39;t risk saying the wrong thing.&quot; She closed the gap to him. Leaning in to lick his neck. Henry inhaled her delicate perfume. This was the wife he knew.<br />
<br />
She whispered, &quot;Just because I can&#39;t cum, doesn&#39;t mean you should be deprived. You&#39;re safe after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without giving him a chance to respond, she closed her mouth around his and began scrabbling at his belt.<br />
<br />
Henry stiffened and panicked as Joan went at him. Fearful she would pull his pants down, revealing everything.<br />
<br />
Instead, Joan, knowing Henry would bolt if likely to be exposed, simply unzipped his fly and fished his cock out with a smooth motion. <br />
<br />
Henry exhaled in relief as Joan broke the kiss, flashed him a grin and descended.<br />
<br />
On the way down, Joan&#39;s nose picked up a sent. Another vaguely musty scent. Jess&#39;s scent. This idiot didn&#39;t even wash his cock. <br />
<br />
Needs must, Joan thought as she wrapped her lips around his slick head and began to bob. She instantly tasted her daughter&#39;s juices, mixed in with the taste of cum.<br />
<br />
Overall she didn&#39;t think it was bad at all. It smelled and tasted heady, only her anger and thoughts of revenge kept her from enjoying this.<br />
<br />
With gusto she began to bob her head. Tongue flicking. Hands working the shaft. She was going to give this her all.<br />
<br />
She felt Henry begin to pant. Perfect, she thought. She would have him dribbling in cum in no time.<br />
<br />
Less than two minutes she was sucking the cock that had only so recently been in her daughter, when she began to hear Henry moan and pant loudly, signalling an impeding load. She grinned into his cock, she would get her revenge.<br />
<br />
Just as she felt his dick tense, however, she heard Henry call out, <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Cow this is is good.&quot; The first dribble hit her tongue, but she didn&#39;t react as she pulled back, face agape.<br />
<br />
That sneaky bastard! She was livid.<br />
<br />
Eyes closed Henry continued to cum. First hitting Joan in the face, then as she pulled back to wipe the semen from her cheeks and lips, the floor.<br />
<br />
By the time Henry made a panicked show of grabbing his ass and tail, Joan was already standing.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d outfoxed her here. But she&#39;d win this. He was going down.</p>
