<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Mike thought about the wolf beast he&#39;d just seen Ashkii turn into, and then watched him rapidly change back into his now very naked human form.  He had a million questions for the teen, but he wanted to become a shapeshifter if Ashkii could really make him become one, too.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be much help if I were still just a human, Ashkii, so yeah, I wanna become a yennadooshi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashkii chuckled.  &quot;Well, first off, Mike, you&#39;ll need to learn how to say what you will become correctly.  Then I&#39;ll answer some of your questions after I sing an ancient Navajo ceremonial song to you.  It&#39;ll help your spirit understand exactly what I am, and even help you to become yeenaldlooshi.  Okay.  In the Navajo tongue, Mike, it is called, Yee Naaldlooshii.  Say it after me, Mike.  Yee...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;gnawled-loo-shee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... naaldlooshi!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, spoken like you&#39;re a true Native American, Mike.  I knew you and I were a lot alike. That&#39;s the second part, but let me sing my song to you and um, no, Mike, I need to be naked when I sing to you.  Then, I&#39;ll need you to remove your clothes after I&#39;ve stopped singing, okay?  No, it&#39;s okay, Mike.  I won&#39;t force you to do anything you don&#39;t want me to.  And yes, Mike, we&#39;re all alone.  We have almost six hours before my parents get home.  Plenty of time.  Just relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike felt uncomfortable that he&#39;d have to strip in front of his naked friend, especially since he now had an erection after seeing Ashkii&#39;s black pubes and the size of that wolf cock when he&#39;d turned into the beast.  Fortunately, the Navajo teen was a lot smaller than him, at least in his human form, and Ashkii&#39;s low-hanging balls made his stiff uncut cock look even smaller than the circumcised cock securely hidden in Mike&#39;s own Calvin&#39;s.<br />
<br />
But Mike was always a bit jealous of guys with black pubic hairs.<br />
<br />
His pubes were light blond, even lighter than the spiked light blond hair on his head.  It made him look practically hairless down there.  Like a little kid.  But Ashkii&#39;s thick pubic hairs were jet-black, and dark as those Asian teens he&#39;d seen in the showers before and after swim practice.  Ashkii&#39;s jungle was so black it even made him look like one of those Asians, and the bushy nest was clearly more plentiful than Mike&#39;s boyishly small blond nest.<br />
<br />
As Ashkii began to sing, Mike listened to the calming Navajo song and sensed an awakened peacefulness envelope him.  It was as if he floated into space, or through it into another realm or dimension.  He was mesmerized by the soft sing-song words he was hearing but couldn&#39;t understand.  He couldn&#39;t turn his gaze from Ashkii&#39;s stiffened boner though, and Mike felt himself getting harder as he watched the Navajo teenager&#39;s cock grow even more erect as he sang.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Mike,&quot; Ashkii said at the end of the song, tucking those long black manes of hair behind his ears.  &quot;Just because you popped a boner looking doesn&#39;t make you gay, Mike.  I know you&#39;re not gay, and I wouldn&#39;t have stripped in front of you if I thought you liked a guy&#39;s dick.  Now take off all your clothes and let me see yours, Mike.  Then we&#39;ll both get to see each other popping a boner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike pulled his shirt up over his head and tossed it onto Ashkii&#39;s bed.  He felt even more uncomfortable unfastening the button on his jeans.  He unzipped his zipper and slid his jeans off, determined to do this but terrified about exposing his erect cock to the Navajo teen.  He&#39;d actually struggled with not just running off when Ashkii told him to strip, but sliding off his cotton CK briefs, and then handing them to Ashkii had happened so quickly he wasn&#39;t even sure why he&#39;d just willingly done it, revealing his erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!  Your cock&#39;s bigger than mine,&quot; Ashkii said, gawking at Mike&#39;s crotch for several moments before lowering his stare and searching inside the damp pouch of Mike&#39;s briefs.  He reached into them and withdrew two strands of blond pubic hair, tossing the blond teen&#39;s designer underpants onto his bed.<br />
<br />
Ashkii raised his hand up into a thin ray of sunlight, examining the pubes, smiling.  &quot;The moment I consume these, Mike, I&#39;ll know every one of your most private guarded thoughts.  But I&#39;ll also need to be able to look like you for a couple of weeks, and I&#39;m now willing to steal your face so I can do just that.  I&#39;ll know everything you know, but there&#39;s no turning back once I start, Mike.  Are you sure you want me to do this so you can be yeenaldlooshi?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike nodded eagerly.  &quot;Yes!  I said I would, so yeah, but does that mean I get to look like--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you to be yeenaldlooshi, Mike,&quot; Ashkii interrupted, &quot;yes, you&#39;ll have to look like me until you&#39;ve satisfied my tribe. It shouldn&#39;t take more than a week or two for you to convince all the spirit warriors you know how to calm my wolf.  Then I&#39;ll make you my brother, my younger brother.  But I&#39;ll let you keep your own mind so you&#39;ll still remember all your own thoughts, Mike, and since I&#39;m gay you&#39;ll become as gay as I am.  That means only guys will get you horny from now on, too.  There&#39;s a few closeted jocks at school who really like my attention, both during and after school, so like me, Mike, you&#39;ll be a gay bottom for them.  They aren&#39;t forcing me, Mike.  I could stop them if I wanted, but I don&#39;t.  Only one of them can get a little too aggressive when their team loses, but he&#39;s so hot I like it.  Especially when he dominates me like that.  And I know he likes me, too.  A lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike heard Ashkii talking, but he wasn&#39;t really listening too closely. It didn&#39;t matter what Ashkii was saying.  Regardless of anything he&#39;d have to do, he wanted those same powers so he could turn into a huge wolf beast just like Ashkii.  He&#39;d heard fragments of what Ashkii was explaining, but he&#39;d become so fixated on a photograph hanging above Ashkii&#39;s trinket cluttered desk, he tried not to listen to the details Ashkii was explaining.<br />
<br />
In the image, a youthful Ashkii was seated on a massive glossy black horse, bareback, wearing nothing but a skimpy leather loincloth.  Mike didn&#39;t know there were 10 or 11-year-old Navajo boys who still wore that type of traditional outfit of their Navajo Indian Tribe on the Reservation less than 100 miles away.<br />
<br />
Ashkii had noticeably defined abdominal muscles even then--as a pre-teen--and a far more muscle sculpted body now as a teenager in high school.  Better than even Ryan Thorton, the football captain.<br />
<br />
Despite everything Ashkii was rambling on about, Mike couldn&#39;t help but imagine what the physical changes would feel like becoming Ashkii&#39;s wolf beast once he knew how to do that same shapeshifting thing, too.  Having Ashkii&#39;s striking Navajo good looks and his shiny long black hair and black pubes, even if only temporary, was far too enticing to say no.<br />
<br />
Reading Mike&#39;s enthusiasm and genuine willingness to do this even though he believed all of it was temporary, Ashkii accepted Mike&#39;s fascination to become his wolf.  He quickly inserted both blond pubic hairs into his mouth and swallowed them.<br />
<br />
Now, without even understanding all of the changes he&#39;d soon need to demonstrate to the tribe&#39;s chosen spirit warriors over the next two weeks, Mike Baka was about to experience the initial painful physical changes that he was going to feel by becoming Ashkii Windtalker.  And until Mike learned to control his yeenaldlooshi&#39;s unleashed appetites, Ashkii knew Mike would soon be losing more than just a few years of that teenage innocence to his Navajo wolf&#39;s own hungers.  Especially at night, when his wolf would want to go out and hunt.<br />
<br />
But the longer Mike&#39;s own unclaimed captured spirit went without Mike responding to its wolf spirit&#39;s ancestral guiding voice, the more feral his wolf&#39;s needs were going to become, and the more control it would have over Mike afterward.<br />
<br />
Ashkii had already heard its distant voice, and Mike had even answered its call when he asked him to be his partner for Mr. Neville&#39;s werewolf posterboard assignment.<br />
<br />
Ashkii hadn&#39;t even planted that voice inside Mike Baka&#39;s head.  That&#39;s why he knew he could trust Mike with his Navajo secret, actually several secrets about himself.<br />
<br />
But Mike hadn&#39;t seemed very surprised or concerned about anything Ashkii had said after he&#39;d passed out once Ashkii let his wolf&#39;s 7&#39; form come shapeshifting out right in front of him.<br />
<br />
Especially, Ashkii shivered, the bombshell he dropped when he told Mike that he was gay!  Mike&#39;s reaction to it was just as accepting to that as when he told him that if he agreed to be yeenaldlooshi then he&#39;d also become just as gay as him!  And that from then on, he&#39;d only be turned-on by guys, too!<br />
<br />
He&#39;d even told Mike about the jock&#39;s at school who believed they were forcing themselves on him every day.  But Mike had remained unresponsive even when Ashkii said he&#39;d willingly do whatever the closeted-jocks wanted because he liked it.<br />
<br />
When Mike didn&#39;t respond that he&#39;d need to be him for 2 weeks, enjoying the same &#39;forced&#39; jock sex he did, Ashkii knew why Mike wasn&#39;t overwhelmed.  He&#39;d just willingly agreed to become gay just to be able to shapeshift into a wolf.  That was the problem with finding anyone worthy enough to be offered the honor of becoming yeenaldlooshi.<br />
<br />
Even in his own Tribe, only a few younger boys were innocent enough to be changed, even agreeing to switch and take Mike&#39;s place afterward.  But after Ashkii read Mike&#39;s mind on their way over to his house, he knew the teen was a genuine innocent sweet kid, and since Mike was so inexperienced sexually, it wouldn&#39;t take long for the lucky Navajo boy to completely end Mike&#39;s virginity.  That would ensure both a permanent physical change for Mike, and seal the blood-relating bond Ashkii needed him to gain to become his true Navajo brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mike!  It&#39;s done,&quot; Ashkii stated, grabbing Mike&#39;s jeans and shoes off the floor.  He set them onto his bed.  &quot;We should get all our clothes ready before we do anything more, before my parents get home.  We got time, Mike, but you don&#39;t want them thinking you&#39;re having sex with some hunky blond guy from school if one of them comes home early and sees us both sitting here at our blank posterboard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; Mike said, unsure what Ashkii had said as he looked away from the photograph.<br />
<br />
Ashkii pulled his red hamper from the corner and dumped its contents onto the floor and began searching through the pile.  &quot;They know I&#39;m gay, Mike, and they&#39;re okay with that, but I promised my Mom I&#39;d never invite a guy inside my bedroom and have sex with them if they weren&#39;t home.  Damn!  That sounded kinky, but you know what I mean.  I&#39;ll pick out some clothes for you since I destroyed everything I was wearing today, but first we&#39;ll both need to change into each other, Mike.  My wolf&#39;s going to get you extremely aroused real easy.  But I can help you through this when you learn what his needs are going to make you want to do to the strange male he smells, and that&#39;ll be me since I&#39;ll be in your body and you&#39;ll be in mine.  I&#39;ll still have to let him teach you the dream songs that satisfies him, and then I&#39;ll show you how to quickly calm my wolf.  You ready?&quot; ...</p>
