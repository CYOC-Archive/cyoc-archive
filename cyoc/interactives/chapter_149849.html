<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well...&quot; Steve started. &quot;Since you want to be adult like in some of your actions, why don&#39;t you spend sometime with your mother to learn a thing or two?&quot; He said as he activated his magical wristwatch.<br />
<br />
Alan braced as he felt the changes hit. He found his height slowly shrinking a bit until his eye level matched his mother&#39;s. Though, his vision was quickly blocked as his curly blond hair grew out past his shoulders, slightly covering his eyes. He felt weight increase on his chest as two sensitive mounds formed while his figure molded into a more pear shape. His butt expanded as his clothes shifted into something closer to his mother&#39;s clothing. Finally, he felt his pride and joy shoot up inside of him as it reshaped into a 40 something female genitalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell...&quot; He muttered in his now much higher pitched voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Look at you! You&#39;re so cute!&quot; Janet squealed as she played with Alan&#39;s now much longer hair. &quot;You make a great woman.&quot; She chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and strangely enough you look a lot like your mother.&quot; Steve chimed in. &quot;Minus the hair, you both look very close.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon hearing that, Alan rushed over to the nearest mirror. What he saw was himself if her was much older and if he had been born a woman. To his shock, he also agreed with his dad. He looked a lot like his mother. Alan figured that would be the case however, as he had always looked more like his mom than his dad, but he also never figured he&#39;d ever actually see just how close it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, cool.&quot; Alan said, making no effort to be enthusiastic at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, &#39;sis&#39;, it&#39;s not so bad.&quot; Janet teased. &quot;You wanted to have fun and do adult things? Well now you get to do fun adult woman things with your big sister Janet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please! I already told you I didn&#39;t mean-&quot; Alan began before Steve interrupted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Alana, but your sister is right. Now, have fun shopping.&quot; He smirked. <br />
<br />
Janet giggled as she grabbed Alan&#39;s arm, her purse, and her keys as the two &#39;women&#39; walked out the door arm in arm. The next 5 hours were hell on Earth for Alan. Although he may have been a middle aged woman in body, his mind was still that of a teenaged boy. Every store felt like an hour while they would only be in there for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Janet made Alan go on a modeling spree, trying on every girly dress that Janet could find. One part of Janet was punishing Alan for his misbehavior, but another part of her was loving spending time with &#39;Alana&#39; at the mall. She never had a sister, so she was enjoying every second of it, even if Alan hated it. It was only after the salon that Janet finally concluded it was time to go home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough shopping for today.&quot; She announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhh, finally!&quot; Alan huffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Don&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t have fun? You must have at least liked the salon!&quot; Janet fake pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shopping sucked Mom.&quot; Alan announced. &quot;And the salon was the worst of all! I don&#39;t see why I had to have my stupid hair straightened and dyed brown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well obviously so we can be full twins and so that you can get a nice experience in!&quot; She defended.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean that if you wanted my hair brown you could have just made it that way!&quot; He retorted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; Janet laughed as she turned to walk towards the exit.<br />
<br />
Alan just sighed again and followed his mother out the exit. The two drove home as they actually talked about some of the sillier things they saw. Alan did end up laughing a bit now being able to look back on it all, but he still felt incredibly embarrassed at everything that had happened. They got home to find the house empty as Janet yawned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew, I am exhausted. Why didn&#39;t my big strong son carry the bags for me hmm?&quot; She teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe because your son was having back problems due to these.&quot; He snapped back as he squeezed his large tits.<br />
<br />
Janet laughed and then hoped onto the couch, leaning back into the cushion with a pillow on her head as she turned on one of her soap operas. Alan sat down on the other end of the couch and groaned at her choice of show.<br />
&quot;Ugh, why this?&quot; He asked. &quot;I always get so bored I fall asleep to these.&quot; He whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorryyy.&quot; She yawned. &quot;I just wanted to put something to fall asleep to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Alan yelled. &quot;You gotta change me back!&quot; He yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father&#39;ll do it.&quot; She said as she finally drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Alan just stared annoyed at the tv for almost ten minutes, frustrated out of his mind. He was now stuck waiting for his father because his mother was too lazy to do it herself. He figured he could just wait till tomorrow, but as it currently stood Alan didn&#39;t want to be in that body any longer than he had to. Finally, he heard footsteps behind him as he realized his father was home.<br />
<br />
He felt hands cover his eyes as his father asked &quot;Guess who?&quot; in his joking tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank God, I&#39;ve been waiting for you!&quot; Alan sighed relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I bet you have you bad girl.&quot; He growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot; Alan began as he turned his head around, only to suddenly find his Father&#39;s large Penis staring back at him. Alan was about to protest when it was shoved deep down his throat. Alan quickly realized that because of his hair and what he was watching, his father had mistaken him for his mother. He wanted to yell that it was him, but suddenly, his crotch began to grow warm feelings as wetness covered his new female genitals.<br />
<br />
He began to move his tongue up and down as he started to suck herder and harder. It all came naturally to Alan as he gave his own father a blow job. After a few more minutes of sucking, while Steve tugged at Alan&#39;s hair, Alan finally managed to will himself to take the dick out of his mouth. He didn&#39;t even know how to begin to explain who he was or what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, but...&quot; He tried to explain, pointing at the real Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotcha honey.&quot; He said as he adjusted his watch. Janet vanished and Alan stared ion shock. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, our &#39;baby boy&#39; is now safely asleep in his crib.&quot; Steve laughed as he gave Alan a passionate kiss, pulling up his pants for the moment.<br />
<br />
Alan only began to feel more and more turned on. He knew it was the body that wanted it, but he couldn&#39;t control the new feelings or sudden hormones. If he was going to say anything, he had to do it now. Steve noticed that &#39;Janet&#39; looked like she wanted to say something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong baby?&quot; He asked.</p>
