<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon said no more words to Prince Jasper. He left her sitting between some barrels with her feet dangling over the rear of the wagon and the baby cradled in her lap. She assumed the man had returned to sit beside the youth driving the wagon. With the baby now sleeping Jasper was able to examine her new body in the bright moonlight.<br />
<br />
Firstly she confirmed that she was now a female. Her garments, her voice and her lactating breasts had certainly given her that indication, but she had clung to the slim hope that these were part of her disguise and that underneath her skirts her manhood was intact. A quick feel of her groin informed her this was not the case.<br />
<br />
She was also able to examine her hair. It was braided as was the fashion for women. Jasper assumed her plaits would have been wrapped in a bun and hidden beneath her bonnet. That was how servants wore their hair. Only noble women, maidens and prostitutes showed their hair in public. Judging by her lactating breasts &quot;Jasmine&quot; was not a maiden. She guessed her braids must have come loose as she had fled.<br />
<br />
Jasper&#39;s hair was long enough that even braided it reached the small of her back. She was able to bring the tress over her shoulder to examine it. Despite the dim light she could see her hair was thick and the same deep red colour that Jasper had always possessed. She wondered what other features of Jasper she retained.  <br />
<br />
She also examined the child. The infant looked so innocent as it slept. It was hard to believe this was the menacing rebel who had threatened to rape her. Out of curiosity she looked under the infants diaper. It seemed that Jasper was not the only person unmanned that evening. Jasper lay back on the wagon, using some sacks as a mattress and despite the jolting ride, soon fell asleep.<br />
<br />
With a jerk that woke the prince, the wagon came to a stop. Suddenly they were surrounded by men on horses carrying torches. A commanding voice asked &#39;Who are you and why are you on the road this late at night?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jasper heard Simon reply. &#39;I am Simon Muscat of Vingery, I trade wine. I am on the road as I am returning home with my merchandise. I did not want to be caught up in troubles in the capitol&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you for or against the King?&#39; The soldiers Jasper could see drew their swords. They were not in royal colours. They were rebels.<br />
<br />
&#39;I have no interest in politics. I have not taken sides. All I want is to be able to practice my trade and provide for my family and staff&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Dismount from your wagon. Who is with you? I want the wagon searched. There are royalists on the loose&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I am travelling with my apprentice Damon. We also have a wet nurse, by name of Jasmine with us. I am bringing her home to care for my newborn son&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;All of you stand there.  You two search the wagon&#39;<br />
<br />
One of the soldiers approached Jasper. She considered using the amulet once more but dismissed the idea. Her disguise was foolproof. She would save the amulet as a last resort.<br />
<br />
She dropped from the wagon, clutching the baby once more to her breast. The jolt woke the baby who began to cry. She was ushered across to stand beside Simon and the youth. A torch was thrust near her face. A soldier called out &#39;She has red hair&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Remove your bonnet and show your face&#39; it was the same haughty commanding voice that had been speaking to Simon. Someone tore the bonnet from Jasper&#39;s head. She stared at the man with the haughty attitude. He was a red head. Jasper recognised him. It was Marcus Beckhom, son of Baron Beckom, one of the rebel leaders.  This man had at one stage tried to court Jasper&#39;s oldest sister the Princess Elaine. Jasper felt like spitting in his face.<br />
<br />
&#39;Show us that child&#39; the man demanded. The baby was taken from her grasp. The man examined the baby but quickly lost interest. &#39;The baby is not royal. But you... Explain your red hair!&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;She is just a peasant girl. She is not of royal blood&#39; explained Simon &#39;You have seen her child. The mother&#39;s red hair is just some genetic accident. I&#39;m sure you are aware that such girls are in demand as wet nurses&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hmm, She is fair enough to be a princess. How do I know she is the mother of this child? Perhaps her carrying the child is a ruse. Are you one of the Tyrant&#39;s bastards? Speak to me girl&#39;<br />
<br />
Jasper had to fight her pride. She attempted to adopt a country accent and a submissive attitude. Instead of glaring at the man as she felt like doing she looked at his feet, trying to act like the servant girls she was acquainted with at the palace. &#39;Sir. She is my child sir. I am recently widowed. I am with Master Simon as he offered me employment as nurse for his newborn son&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;A widow are you?&#39; Jasper heard many of the soldiers chuckling &#39;This child appears hungry. If you are it&#39;s mother you should be able to comfort it. Show me&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Sir?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Feed the child. Prove you are it&#39;s mother&#39; As the man said this he pulled aside the robe covering Jasper&#39;s chest. Her once more engorged breasts were exposed to the audience of soldiers. The baby was handed back to her. She put it to a breast and it immediately attached to a nipple and began to suckle.<br />
<br />
This display apparently convinced Marcus. Jasper found herself essentially dismissed from the conversation. She was treated as the peasant servant she had claimed to be. She was left alone suckling the child as the soldiers searched the wagon and grilled Simon. She found the suckling of the infant on her breast a very pleasant experience. It served to calm her nerves. Eventually they were allowed to get back onto the wagon and continue their journey. The wagon was two barrels of wine lighter. A &quot;donation&quot; to the rebel cause from Simon.<br />
<br />
The only other words Simon said to her that night were &#39;Tie your bonnet back in place and hide that hair before you get me into further trouble&#39; She was once more left at the rear of the wagon comforting the infant until they both once more fell asleep.</p>
