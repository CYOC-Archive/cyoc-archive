<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day wore on it became quiet warm and the herd wandered to the far end of the valley pasture. A group of spreading Walnut trees offered good shade from a hot Sun. As mares folded up and laid down Chuck stood looking over his harem.<br />
<br />
About four that afternoon Mrs. Ranskin looked out from her front porch to check on the pony herd. Billy had finished his chores and returned home to his now proud parents. Proud they were that she had talked sense into him and he so quickly changed his ways and discarded old and ugly friends. If they ever found out that during a breakin at her farm he found his true calling, but the new Billy desired to make something of himself.<br />
<br />
Now she strained to see the herd, to her surprise Chuck stood far to oneside. He was nearest the Northeast corner where he looked over the highway to Cooper. The stallion was not paying any attention to his herd and looked like he prefered to be alone.<br />
<br />
After so many transmutations over the years his actions were those of a mind considering it present state. Chuck was in a pattern of deepening remorse over what he was and what he had been. Head hung low tail calm he was no doubt upset from his new lifestyle. A human mind locked into the stallions world wants more than just to graze, parade around, sniff and fondle, and when the time is right mount. Just as Kazan he had hit that moment when early in his pony life her got tired of just being alive to have sex. The human he was needed hurdles to jump and mountains to climb, yet as the pony he lost all that and was on earth for a very basic reason.<br />
<br />
Opening the pasture gate she began the long walk out to visit her pony. The mares saw her coming and began to rise up and meet what they considered a friend. Chuck her the snorting and whinnies which made him look over his withers.<br />
<br />
As she walked closer the stallion stood as before in a depressed stance and looking sad as much a pony's face might be able.<br />
<br />
Sitting down to the grass and leaning against the wire fence Mrs. Ranskin spoke her spell so Chuck could tell his thoughts.<br />
<br />
A smooth stroke of his hairy face made the stallion step very close and then folding his legs flopped down near the lady. &quot;I'm sad, I bet you could tell!&quot; said Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sad Chuck with all those mares to keep a stallion company?&quot; replied Mrs. Ranskin knowing he had more on his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Misses I feel sad for those I've left, even though my body might go back to what it was doing with Ely living my life there. I miss the trappings of my human life. The people I knew and our relationships!&quot; said Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you can have relations with as many mares and get a deeper feeling...&quot; the lady started to explain, but was cut off by Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, NO, no not sexual relarionship but personal interaction with people and personalities, I miss that! Oh the sex with pony mares is wwild and raw sex as I never felt with my wife, true enough! It's different here to be sure but I just get bored! Bored, you must agree a person suddenly thrust into a life and form made for to graze, and walk about in such calm it's, it's borring!&quot; Chuck tried to explain.<br />
<br />
As he laid there the mare which he had mounted that morning stepped close and offered a friendly lick to his sheath. &quot;See here comes another and all the mare wants is to satisfy her sexual tingle in that round hairy butt! She doesn't show love only the lusting passion to relieve and itch and I'm the sensual scratching post! Chuck rambled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Chuck I didn't make you become a pony, it was maybe a mistake for you to have exchanged bodies with Ely. Yet it's happened and there is no known way on earth for me to change you back to the human your once were! A stallion is a wonderous creature, he shows leadership to his herd. He takes the responsibility for their safety. He fills their needs with an animal kind of passion. Not love but just the lust which drives them, but it still needs someone to quell their desrires, and that you dearest!&quot; explained the lady.<br />
<br />
Chuck stood up and reached his muzzel close to give her a small peck of a rubber liped kiss. His mind was at ease with now some reasons to life for and looking around his maorning mare nestled close with her passions.<br />
<br />
Chuck turned to the lady, &quot;Females they are so demanding!&quot; As the mare pressed her muzzeel down along Chucks flanks and her warm breath touched his sheath, the monster pony cock fell out and came to rigid attention. Mrs. Ranskin reached her hand and cupped the end of his shaft. &quot;Chuck this is your heritage to the herd, guard it well, but enjoy it to the fullest!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck stepped away from the lady his pony cock slapping from side to side as he walked. A quick look backwards he recieved a friendly wink for the lady, and turning back to business took a loving sniff of the mare's perfume.</p>
