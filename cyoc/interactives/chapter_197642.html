<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neil rubbed his forehead as he thought about the implications of these changes. He turned away to do so, Matt still lazing back on the bed, stretching and showing off his leaner, more streamlined body. How had things gotten to this point...? Here Neil was, having just fucked his college bully, and now he was considering his next move like that was all just nothing. Because...honestly, it had felt almost cathartic in a way. Knowing that Matt was so far removed as a threat that Neil could just bare everything to him like that.<br />
<br />
However, as much as Neil would&#39;ve loved to continue their encounter, he had other things he intended on doing that day. The young man stretched as he stood up and examined himself again in the mirror. It was completely fucking unreal how far these changes could really go. It didn&#39;t exactly fully change him yet, but now he could remember rudimentary lessons in Korean as a child. Lessons he never really had, but ones that gave him at least a basic understanding of the language.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the changes in his appearance. Neil ran a hand through his straighter, slightly darker hair after pulling back up his shorts. He considered returning to normal upon the next sexual encounter he had with one of the guys, but he was also just as well feeling very curious about the prospects of going further. It almost made him grin a little mischievously. Well, he did have some control it seemed over what exactly happened...however incidental it might&#39;ve been.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case, it seemed it started with the threesome with Sandra. Nothing happened when he had sex with Bradley. And yet things really started changing outside of just visits to the gym when he got involved with Lucas and Brock. Neil watched his wide back flaring as he pulled on his red stringer. Fuck but he was looking astonishing today. And he could tell Matt could see that too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;re you going, man?&quot; Matt asked in a light tone, kicking his legs as he relaxed on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m thinking of going to have a light workout with Brock. See what he&#39;s up to.&quot; Neil answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! My buddies! Yeah, Brock and Lucas have been looking really good.&quot; Matt said with a satisfied smile, &quot;Not as good as you, but then, few people are, big man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil pondered something, and remembered the night he spent with Brock. The woman he and Brock spent their time with - Clarissa. He decided to test something some time, &quot;Hey Matt. Would you be down to join me in a threesome some time? I&#39;ve got a woman named Clarissa who I really charmed the pants off of a night or two ago. You down if she&#39;s down?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt seemed to brighten up at that, and nodded enthusiastically, &quot;You got it, man! I&#39;m not entirely open about it around school, but I&#39;m a total bisexual. Does she have nice boobs? A tight ass?&quot; And there was at least a vestige of the old Matt. An eagerness to get laid, though now with anyone and everyone. Regardless of their gender. <br />
<br />
The shifts were entirely outside of Matt&#39;s notice, but that didn&#39;t make it at least a little weird seeing the guy who had previously been so derisive of man on man suddenly being so interested in the idea - in addition to man on woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and yes,&quot; Neil answered, and found himself suppressing a chuckle when he noticed Matt&#39;s face brighten, and the pretty young man started palming his groin outright. It seemed Matt&#39;s libido was intense enough at this point that even getting a hint or something to envision was enough to get him outright humping his own hand. &quot;Wow, seems that got you into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t help it, man,&quot; Matt gulped as he managed to keep his hand off of his groin, &quot;I dunno what got me so into you, but I am - and the idea of me, you, and a hot babe in the room...it just gets me going!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Neil considered, thinking about Matt&#39;s new nature, &quot;I&#39;ll be heading out so...feel free to hang around, chat, <i>do whatever...</i>...&quot; Neil winked a little and then started to head to his preworkout containers. He found that he always had a few on hand for when he needed to go hit the gym. It seemed like this &quot;professional bodybuilder&quot; Neil Booth was always ready for these kinds of outings. As he pulled on a light jacket, he saw Matt just sitting there, eagerly waiting...and even as he walked out the door to go and enjoy his day, he could hear the telltale sounds of Matt getting down to business by himself in there.<br />
<br />
Neil just shook his head and figured keeping Matt around would be good. If nothing else, as a means to test out what went on with his changes, and the limits therein. For now, he would keep things under control. Though if something happened... well, he&#39;d decide when he got to that point.<br />
<br />
It looked like Max was out - he&#39;d left a note saying that he was gonna be going to hit the gym, and that the hike would go on later in the day. Neil just wondered if Max was heading to 20 Fitness for his workout, and how going to...what, his seventh day now? How that would impact Max&#39;s looks, and attitude on the trip. He was one of the aware ones, Neil remembered, but just as well, there were certain shifts in the way things were.<br />
<br />
Heading out after packing his bag with his workout drinks, Neil found himself walking out toward Brock&#39;s place. He remembered the locale due to the wild night the two of them had - and walking there, in the light rather than in the dark of night, reminded Neil of how nice the place and the surrounding area was. It was like walking into a line up of the best apartments and houses in the area. All lined up and properly maintained, probably sculpted to give the appearance of perfection.<br />
<br />
It was common that he forgot due to how Brock was now, but it was clear by his surroundings and accommodations that Brock came from old money. <br />
<br />
Before long he found Brock&#39;s place - which was still by all appearances the pad of a college student. Even though the man who lived there was probably old enough to be the grandfather of a college student - at least physically. As Neil walked up to the front door, he admittedly didn&#39;t know how Brock would be presenting himself today. That episode of what seemed like a whole different mentality still weighed on Neil&#39;s perception. He wondered if that really was a hint of what was to come...or a conscious imitation of that &quot;Sir&quot; guy who made such a stirring impression on Brock.<br />
<br />
After two rings of the doorbell, Neil heard the voice he&#39;d gotten used to identifying as Brock Medina&#39;s shout from inside, &quot;Be right there! Just needed to finish some college work!&quot; Ah, yes. Neil remembered. College work. That must be quite an experience. Seeing Brock walk into class like he was now, acting every bit the college boy...<br />
<br />
Before long, the door opened up, and there he was. Brock Medina - roughly about sixty years old, though you&#39;d hardly guess that was his mental age. He was dressed solely in a pair of gray workout pants, not even bothering to wear a shirt, in the process showing off his massive, roid-enhanced muscular physique. Seeing him like this, Neil could really see how weathered and yet strong Brock looked. He&#39;d apparently taken to shaving - as many bodybuilders do, though there were some very light spots of salty colored hair on his broad chest. <br />
<br />
His face was shaved up - apparently Brock had decided to just go completely bald rather than deal with his hair issues, though Neil pondered the justification the man used. He was still a very handsome man, with broad features, though now he was decidedly wrinkled and aged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahah, Neil! Glad to see you in today, bro,&quot; Brock fistbumped Neil as the older man welcomed him into the pad. &quot;You ready for our home workout today? I got some sweet workout gear here. So it&#39;ll be light, but still reasonably intense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...I guess everyone needs a bit of a rest day,&quot; Neil said with an awkward chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, even a big strong muscle stud like yours truly eventually needs to take a hiatus...&quot; Brock groaned, &quot;I swear, after you left, I pounded Parker&#39;s ass so hard it was like...I pulled something in my fucking ass! Had to take a break. Can you believe that? I fucked too hard!&quot; Brock lightly jabbed Neil&#39;s shoulder and both men chuckled at the idea. Though Neil was himself was starting to notice some hints as to Brock&#39;s true age.<br />
<br />
There were a few items, littered around the area, that would only make sense for an older man to have. Yet it seemed for now that Brock didn&#39;t even notice. Or outright shrugged them off. Something along the lines of &quot;I swear, my gramps leaves his stuff all over when he visits!&quot; and then more chuckling before chatting about the latest women and men who caught Brock&#39;s eye.<br />
<br />
Neil for his part played along. He didn&#39;t know what another sexual episode might do to Brock, and he wasn&#39;t entirely in a hurry to find out. The guy was old enough physically already. <br />
<br />
Before long, Brock led the way into a large and well ventilated room with a sun roof, luminating the room in a pleasant light. There were six benches across the room in various configurations, all made for different kinds of workouts and weights. Some were outfitted with bench bars, others were plain flat benches, and at least one or two were respectively incline and decline benches. There was a squat rack by the corner, with a large number of weights associated with it. <br />
<br />
There was even a pull up bar by the door. <br />
<br />
There was a rack along the wall with a number of dumbbells - all going up to a pair of 100 pounders. Neil outright whistled, &quot;Nice place! I swear this is one of the best home gyms I&#39;ve seen in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Brock responded, &quot;The best in all that money can buy. Why be a college rich boy if you&#39;re not gonna spend for some workout gear?&quot; Brock chuckled, as if he didn&#39;t realize he hadn&#39;t been a &quot;college boy&quot; in a long time physically. &quot;Ahh, I love hitting this gym. Privacy and good weights, plus we don&#39;t have to worry about proper apparel policies, heheh...&quot; Brock chuckled, a deep and somewhat unfitting laugh for such an established looking man.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh, how do you want to get started?&quot; Neil asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we start by getting comfortable.&quot; Brock said, right before taking off his workout pants as well - an act that Neil would&#39;ve before been shocked by - but now, it just didn&#39;t surprise him as much. He still did stare a bit, which Brock seemed to catch. Standing there solely in a pair of tight compression shorts, Brock shrugged, &quot;Well, we&#39;re two big, buff men, in the height of our fitness, in a personal gym. Why not workout like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Sure, man, sure.&quot; Neil promptly followed the example, stripping down to his tight boxers - now neither of the two left much to the imagination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start with some bench press, bro,&quot; Brock eagerly went on to the bench press, fixing on some lighter weight than usual - fitting for this being a rest day. And it seemed despite being heavier than most people could manage, 225 for the likes of Brock and Neil would be exactly that lighter weight that the two of them saw fit to do on a rest day.<br />
<br />
Neil watched Brock slowly ease himself into the rhythm of bench press - even though it seemed that Brock was mentally a college guy, there were some hints at what was to come. Especially in how Brock handled the weights. A level of expertise beyond what someone of Brock&#39;s mental age might be capable of. The older man grunted as he pumped through the weights, laughing as he crested ten reps, and kept going until he reached 20 reps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haah, and that&#39;s 20 reps at 225 pounds. Whew...check me out, bro.&quot; Brock grinned and flexed his chest, as always eager to make a show of himself.<br />
<br />
Before long, Neil got on there and found himself settling into a similar rhythm, though much easier than Brock managed. Neil admitted maybe it was a sign of the times that he was so easily bench pressing something that even a week ago, he&#39;d be struggling to so much as do once. There was a lot these changes had done for him...but at the same time, they&#39;d changed a lot about him beyond just his fitness. No doubt he would need to continue this investigation.<br />
<br />
Still, the feeling of so easily benching 225 lbs was getting Neil pretty hyped up in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
Brock outright laughed as he saw Neil finishing the bench set, &quot;Looks like hitting a nice enough pump turns you on, too!&quot; Brock looked directly at Neil&#39;s groin, where the younger bodybuilder&#39;s cock rested, half hard in his boxers, and presenting an appealing impression in the fabric. Neil for his part realized this, and said, &quot;Should we uhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you down to have some fun between sets?&quot; Brock asked with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends on what you mean.&quot; Neil hoped to try and keep this from further changing Brock. Maybe there were some ways to handle this without leading to a further transformation...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re getting into this,&quot; Brock stated, &quot;And I don&#39;t wanna tumble around my workout equipment. How about we just work it off - and when we&#39;re done, we get back to the workout.&quot; It was...an appealing offer. Though as Neil looked at him, it seemed like even though Neil was pretty excited due to the blood pumping, Brock was still flaccid...</p>
