<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“The frightening string of disappearances has shaken the city to the core. At least 25 people have disappeared, all in mysterious circumstances. Police still do not have any evidence to link any of them together. The FBI has now joined the investigation and have reportedly focused on the disappearances of two local high school students and their families. They are also interested in the possible connection of the murder of a local high school boy, along with unconfirmed reports of the residences of the two missing girls homes burning down. More on this ongoing tragedy soon. In other news, a video has gone viral claiming to have caught a “demon” on video though authorities have dismissed it as fake…”<br />
<br />
The news reports were on the TV as Lilith waited for all the employee’s of The Demon’s Lounge to show for work. “Well, it appears the chaos has already ensued…though certainly too soon. It was a good thing that I sent all but me and Lucy to work on getting territory in hell. Though Malice is still here, he hasn’t quite completed everything he needs to in this realm.” None of the employees as she could see were particularly remarkable. All of them would make excellent demon’s but none of them had the potential to be part of her inner circle. “Ugh, I need stop thinking about that. Rushing to get all 7 can only lead to ruin. Lucy and Draken are a good start, and that’s all I need.”  Lilith watched the twentieth and last employee should for the day. “Alright let’s get this started.” Lilith stood up to walk back to her new office.<br />
<br />
“Lucy, Draken, it is time. Mr. Warner, you will tell them of the “sale” and will return here for your fate. Understood?” Lilith looked at the old man in a trance, “Yes, my mistress.”, Lilith looked at her other two servants, “Your job is to make sure none of them try to leave while I cast the spell, and then to help those who resist, even if it is futile.”<br />
<br />
Lucy and Draken smiled and agreed with their Queen. “Queen Lilith are you sure you can use that instrument?”, Lucy asked her Queen. “Do not worry, everything will go according to plan.”<br />
<br />
The four entered the room with 12 strippers and 8 bouncers getting ready for the day. “Ladies and Gentlemen, if I may have your attention”, Mr. Warner looking normal, not under a trance. “I will keep this short; I am selling my business. Do not worry, Mrs. Lilith here has already guaranteed your continued employment here. As for myself, this will more than likely be the last time you see of me. I am retiring to elsewhere. Thank You for being here with me through all the hardships The Demon’s Lounge has faced.” Mr. Warner smiled and left the room heading to Lilith office to see what his fate was.<br />
<br />
The room suddenly erupted with cheers as the door closed. Everyone knew how shady Warner was, most were only here to pay off expenses.  Lilith walked to the center of the room and suddenly the room went quiet. They had never seen someone of her beauty before. “Hello there my new employees. I am Lilith Diable. And this is my business partner Lucy Libidine. You other employee, Derek has already heard this speech since he was here much earlier in the day. I’m sure many of you have questions, but first I have something to give you all.<br />
<br />
Most of the employees were sitting down as Lilith pulled out Baphinox getting ready to cast her spell. A couple of the bouncers laughed but soon become entranced with the soft tune that Lilith began playing. The tune began to pick up in speed and became much darker sounding. A purple light began to emit from Lilith’s fingers. The employees who still weren’t entranced noticed this and began to panic, one of the bouncers breaking for the door, only to be stopped by Draken. “Derek! what are you do-” , before he could finish the bouncer was push back into a seat across the room.<br />
<br />
Lucy and Draken saw no reason to keep the charade up anymore, changing into their demonic forms at either side of Queen Lilith. The purple light got brighter and so did the panicked screams, trying to find any way to escape. Only there was none, their fates sealed with one more chord.<br />
<br />
Lilith smiled and laughed with a euphoric look as she struck the final chord of the spell. Purple bolts of lightning hit each one of the employees in the room, knocking them out of their chairs or off their feet. It was over in a flash, with many groans coming from the affected employees. A stripper was the first sit up, and immediately felt something off. Looking down she saw he panties were singed off and on her pelvis sat the succubus seal.<br />
<br />
She moved a hand down to feel it when it began to glow a purple color and her libido and arousal became unbearable. She began to masturbate furiously and moaned loudly, unable to stop herself. “What’s happening…to…her…ugh…to us…” A bouncer asked as he became erect and aroused, his incubus seal lighting up. “I don’t know *moan* but it feels…so…GOOD!” the stripper moaned in pleasure. Her B cup breasts exploding to E cups, the rest of her body following suit, becoming sexier and curvier. <br />
<br />
“OH! OH! SO GOOD!” The stripper barely opened her eyes to the sound of clacking heels. Through the haze of arousal, she could see the figure of Lilith in her demon form. Queen Lilith smiled down at the soon-to-be succubus and took the girls face into hands, giving a gentle yet dominating kiss. The girl gave into it immediately and suddenly had thousands of images lashing through her head, overriding any desires and thoughts she had. They went from a future with family, a well paying job, and a fulfilling human life to a future with sex, pleasure, and desire. All with one figure at the center of it. “YES QUEEN LILITH! YES! CORRUPT ME!” she screamed out the second stage of the transformation beginning.<br />
<br />
Lucy meanwhile was riding one of the bouncers hard as he attempted to resist the corruption, but only a few thrusts in he was bouncing with the newly pregnant demon of lust. Draken was in a similar position originally the one on top of a stripper, was now below being ridden by a half transformed succubus. <br />
<br />
The girl Lilith helped along tilted her head back as a blue color worked its way up to her head. A tail and a pair of wings having already grown. She offered no resistance, instead pure acceptance as it covered her head, turning her hair black with blue highlights and a pair of demonic horns growing from it. The new succubus moaned out loudly in orgasm as the last of her humanity was washed away by Lilith. The new demon stood up and opened her yellow silted and black filled eyes. “Thank You, Mistress Lilith. Thank You for freeing me from the shackles of humanity.”<br />
<br />
“Go on and join your fellow demons in pleasure. Remember this first time.” Lilith said as the new succubus turned around to view the growing orgy, jumping onto another girl trying to resist the change with two others. Lilith looked in the corner at the man Draken threw across the room, he had only just started to stir from being knocked out and immediately felt a great increase in arousal but he held onto whatever he could to prevent him from beginning to masturbate.<br />
<br />
Queen Lilith walked over to the man, “Oh this won’t do at all. Here, let me help you join your new brothers and sisters.” Lilith said in a seductive tone and took his member into her hand. A loud moan came from the bouncer because of the simple touch. “Hmmm, I’m in need of some relief myself dear. Enjoy your time with your queen.” Lilith wasted no time and stuck the erect dick into her succubus pussy and began to grind herself on the man.<br />
<br />
The bouncer stood no chance, immediately grabbing onto the demon Queens lush hips, helping her fuck the humanity out of him, his incubus seal glowing brightly as the Queen of all demons pleasured him. The bouncers muscles expanded at an exponential rate, the second stage didn’t even wait for his human body to completely change, the demonic energy Lilith poured into the man already taking over his mind. A red hue began to overtake the bouncer with his changing body. Lilith moaned in pleasure at the man’s growing member, speeding up her thrusts as he grew all the features of a demon. His eyes already red slits filled in with black. “OH, MY QUEEN! ITS SO GOOD!”<br />
<br />
The demon queen smiled, “Cum for me, finish your change!” The new incubus wasted no time, unloading into his queen making her orgasm as well. The demon queen looked down at the large incubus, “It appears I’ve given you quite the boost. How about you become my first demon commander.” The incubus was much larger than the others and wasted no time giving an answer, “Of course my queen.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm, good choice, Greater Demon Titan. Now…round two? We still have much time before other humans show.” Lilith licked her lips, needing this release having held herself back for so long, the Greater Demon wasted no time beginning a second round of demonic pleasure.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Lilith’s new office, Mr. Warner was in the throws of his own change. He immediately de-aged as a seal glowed brightly on him. Except this was different than any other seal received. This one had the heart shape of a succubus seal, but an image of a wolf in the center. The moment the old man had walked into the room he was hit with a spell cast by Lilith, placing the seal on him. Once he de-aged, the heart shape of the seal began its work.<br />
<br />
His vision became clouded by sex, but instead of focusing on women, it showed men and their large, muscular bodies, along with his new Queen Lilith. Mr. Warner orgasmed, and his member began to shrink. As he moaned his pitch rose to nearly a soprano level, soon his penis and balls were gone, replaced by female reproductive organs. The rest if her body began to follow suit. Her pecs exploding size, going from flat to B cups. The new girl groped her expanding bust, going from Bs to C cups to DD cups, before giving one large push out into EE cups. “OH! YES! YES! YES!” The rest of what was Mr. Warner finished feminizing, gaining supple hips and thighs, her underside gaining more mass than her upper torso.<br />
<br />
The new woman masturbated with her new equipment when the wolf image of the seal began to glow. Immediately the girl howled in pleasure, “AWHOOOOO!”. Black fur overtook most of her body quickly, leaving only her abdomen, breasts, and face free from the overtaking of fur. Her hands becoming rounded paws and her feet changing to a digitigrade stance. She began to grow muscle and her stomach became taut with strength. The change reached her face, and it began to push out into a small snout and her ears becoming pointed wolf ears. Finally, a tail began to grow out of the new girls back completing the change. The new, sexy beast howled in pleasure as she orgasmed again. The first hellhound was born.<br />
<br />
“Sleep my dear…change into your hidden form…I will let you know when it is ok to reveal yourself to the world…” The new female hellhound changed into an inconspicuous dog, it appeared as a large Retriever and fell asleep on its new bed, waiting for her mistress to walk into the room later that night.<br />
<br />
“AAAAAHHHHhhhhh” Lilith moaned as she came down from her second orgasm. “Hmmm, I believe its time.” The rest of the new demons were finished their orgasms and pleasure as well. Lilith got off the Greater Demon Titan and prepared herself. All the incubi and succubi looked at their Queen in patience. “You should all know my plan from my…orientation to all of your heads. This world will fall and become mine and you all will help me in that endeavor. But we will not reveal ourselves yet. I have much to do before, but we can start more…discreetly.” <br />
<br />
A flame appeared in the demon queen’s hand, showing an image of a strange seal, one that had many aspects of the their seals and other, undiscovered seals at this point. “This is a dormant seal, only be able to be activated on my order. You all know how to give it. It will spread from here slowly. We must remain hidden. Understood.”<br />
<br />
“YES! MY QUEEN!” the room erupted in unison. The demon queen smiled. “Good. Now change into human forms. Our first ‘customers’ will be here soon and we have to give them a show.<br />
<br />
The new demons changed into human forms including Lucy, Draken, and Lilith herself. Draken left getting ready to tend the bar while Lucy remained behind with Lilith.<br />
<br />
“My Queen, what do you want me to do?” Lucy asked sincerely.<br />
<br />
“Join with them my dear servant, I will do the same every now and then. Besides, you will still remain at my side.” Lilith assured her personal servant.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but what about once I begin to show the signs of carrying a demon?” Lucy asked placing a hand where her demonic womb was.<br />
<br />
“Do not worry, we will cross that road when it comes. Do not fear, I have a feeling it might be slightly popular here.” The demon queen smiled. “In the meantime, carry on your usual duties and make sure my new pet is also well taken care of tonight.”<br />
<br />
“With pleasure, my Mistress Lilith.” Lucy left the room in human clothes. The demon queen picked up Baphinox and made the guitar disappear for now.  A TV was still on in the room, “The Federal Government is clearly in force at the town and may do check ups on businesses and family homes. With Agent Williams, the agent leading the investigation, “We will get to the bottom of this. Rest assured we will find the culprits involved and bring them to justice.”<br />
<br />
Lilith laughed the comment off. “Ha. You can try. But you will not find anything. In fact, all you’ll find, is joining my inner circle Agent Williams. I’ve seen your soul. I know what you desire.”<br />
<br />
The demon queen walked out into the now blaring club music, ready to greet guests for the first night as the new owner, of the Demon’s Lounge.</p>
