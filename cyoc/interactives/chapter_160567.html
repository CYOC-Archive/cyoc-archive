<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the Animalia 2020 Spring Carnival wasn&#39;t as big or as active as other Spring Carnivals, that didn&#39;t mean that it didn&#39;t happen all together. Of course with travel restrictions in place, there were more localized versions of the same theme for the Spring Carnival, which was all about keeping healthy, especially at a time like this.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
While there wasn&#39;t too much going on in terms of large gatherings, there was still plenty to do in Lyre/Animalia. Kat&#39;s Klub, for example, was doing several shows about health and wellness designed to be both educational and kid-friendly while their bar was doing high-vitamin, low-nasty-tasting drinks designed to maximize the amount of Vitamin C that many people needed. One such show was a cooking class that helped with creating, among other things, drinks that could help with the Coronavirus.<br />
<br />
Claw Coliseum, meanwhile, was helping with half-price gym memberships for new members and health-boosting workout classes. While Claw Coliseum was busy in general, with the health-boosting workout classes, now it was even busier, especially with the newer members converting to escape Coronavirus&#39; effects on older people.<br />
<br />
The new news that one of the new, rich, members was the mother of Nicole, who was one of the Meat Market&#39;s dancers, and was joining Animalia to deal with severe psychological issues and reconnect with her estranged daughter. But it was clear from their first meeting that things weren&#39;t going to be reconciled between the two of them with just one meeting. While Nicole&#39;s mother choosing the same species as her daughter was a good first step, Nicole&#39;s response was a frigid comment before getting on stage to do a routine designed to spite her mother on how well her life had improved since leaving her. Her choice of music (<i>Remedy</i> by Little Boots) was the icing on top. Both Miss Fabina, Miss Vivian, and Dr. Jones would have their work cut out to bring the two of them together, especially since Nicole&#39;s father died when Nicole was just a kid, which Dr. Jones felt had added additional emotional baggage to Nicole.<br />
<br />
Buford and Aleta met Max, who had famously drove his parent&#39;s luxury sports car into wet concrete, and was now being punished by his parents by getting only a single dose of bull shark conversion while his parents both got double-dosed. While his parents and Cooper worked on designing their new mansion, Buford and Aleta were enforcing the punishment Max&#39;s parents had enforced, which basically meant that he wasn&#39;t allowed to do anything fun in Animalia. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough, Max&#39;s mother had somehow developed RHS and not only became a new dancer at the Meat Market, but also became part of Nerthus&#39; planned new band as a lead guitar player. Once Miss Fabina had trained her up in both dancing and guitar playing, (and they managed to get a rhythmic guitar player, a bass guitar player, a singer, and synthesizer player, according to Nerthus&#39; plans) they would be giving him a private show. But they didn&#39;t tell him that the &quot;show&quot; would be similar to Jeff&#39;s show of &quot;The King and his Tribute&quot;.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, someone did manage to get a picture of Jeff&#39;s reaction to the show, and made it into a meme about &#39;an overdose of vitamins T.,M., & I.&#39;. Many animalians who didn&#39;t get it had to have it explained as a variant of &#39;too much information&#39;.<br />
<br />

<br />
Dino City also had a similar Spring carnival to Lyre/Animalia&#39;s, and it was just as focused on keeping healthy. But what made it a little different was the number of people undergoing conversion to escape Coronavirus&#39; effect, especially among the elderly. But there were a few things that resulted from this, as well as from other conversions.<br />
<br />
It was revealed that Stacey, after her conversion to another <i>Syntixisaurus Rex</i> was bisexual, and that she was interested in both Jeremy and Heather. This did have sitcom potential, but wasn&#39;t enough to warrant it on TV at the moment. Part of what made it sitcom potential was the fact that Jeremy didn&#39;t seem to have a clue what was going on between Stacey and Heather, and Tyra wasn&#39;t really helping with that.<br />
<br />
Another thing that was going on was one of Tyler&#39;s old band, specifically the rhythmic guitar player, managing to get enough money for a conversion, but what raised some eyebrows was the fact that he had chosen a rather obscure species named <i>Deinocheirus</i>. It took a bit of research, but they were able to find it, as well as why it was rather obscure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently during the early days of paleontology, early paleontology came up with all sorts of weird reconstructed dinosaurs.&quot; said the Dino City Horizon Lab Scientist, bringing it up to show them.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like one of those paleontologists made a horrible mistake after a bad acid trip.&quot; said a second scientist, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fortunately, or unfortunately, this dinosaur is very real, and very weird; with a fan of feathers, a sail on its back, killer claws, and Jar Jar Binks&#39; head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that was it&#39;s protection, similar to therizinosaurus.&quot; said the first.<br />
<br />

<br />
While the Coronavirus was putting a damper on major travel plans, it didn&#39;t mean that all plans were being put on hold to deal with it.</p>
