<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill casually grabbed the gemstone and put it in his pocket, but truth be told, he was honestly too distracted by Joanna Ingerman to care about what had just happened.<br />
<br />
*DID* something just happen? Bill wasn&#39;t completely sure it had. The Ahn&#39;Ger stone had tampered with his memories a little bit. Deep down in his subconscious, he still remembered Big Jon and how that neanderthal had destroyed his car and had been trying to provoke him into a fight just a moment ago, but those memories gave way to a new reality. One where Big Jon had never existed, and Joanna Ingerman, the hottest girl in school...was his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Hey there handsome” smiled Joanna as Bill approached her. Joanna was several inches taller than Bill and had to bend down to kiss him, though Bill didn&#39;t mind. She grabbed his hand and enveloped it into her own, warmly embracing her former enemy in another reality. Bill smiled back, and the two began their journey to school together.<br />
<br />
“You know, I actually kind of like walking to school instead of driving there” said Joanna as she walked hand in hand with Bill. “It&#39;s such a gorgeous day out.”<br />
<br />
“It sure is” said Bill, lost in a daydream that felt too good to be true.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Bill&#39;s new memories continued to inform him of the current reality. Somehow, by some complete stroke of blind luck, he and Joanna had hit it off back in the eighth grade and had been going steady ever since. He recalled double dates with himself, Joanna, Tom, and Gloria. He remembered the first time he had invited Joanna for dinner to his parents house, with Joanna extending the invitation to dine with her own parents at her house. He remembered going to the prom with her last year, and how much his parents complained about the cost of his tuxedo. He remembered the first time they had sex with each other, though neither had told anyone yet. Bill recalled vivid memories of himself inside her sex, and Joanna knowing how to pleasure Bill beyond his wildest imagination.<br />
<br />
His entire teenage life up until this juncture had been obsessed with finding a girlfriend. Bill was definitely not one of those red pill/incel idiots that you find on the internet. He didn&#39;t feel entitled towards having a girlfriend, and it didn&#39;t dominate his entire life, but he had been getting very lonely as of late, watching Tom and Gloria date, break up, get back together, and then break up again all in a circuitous loop all while Bill was forced to resign himself as Tom&#39;s wingman. But now he had one, and it was his former enemy, transformed into a gorgeous maiden! Somewhere deep down inside him, Bill simply couldn&#39;t believe this.<br />
<br />
The two had reached school, both laughing over some silly story that Joanna was telling him that happened to her over cheerleading practice the other day. When they both reached their lockers to grab their books for the day, Bill was approached by another bully, Rob Bolstrum.<br />
<br />
In the old reality, Rob had been one of Big Jon&#39;s minions. Rob was even dumber and more brutish than Jon had been, though since Big Jon was older and had a stronger physique, he had reluctantly acquiesced to Big Jon after the latter had beaten Rob to a pulp in a vicious schoolyard fight to prove his dominance. But that was then...<br />
<br />
Rob slammed Bill about against his locker.<br />
<br />
“Hey pipsqueak. I&#39;ve got bills to pay, so you&#39;re going to help me out. You&#39;re going to be giving me your lunch money every day from now on until...”<br />
<br />
Rob couldn&#39;t finish his threat, as he was suddenly thrown against the adjacent locker by none other than Joanna Ingerman herself.<br />
<br />
“If you touch my man again, you&#39;ll have to face me.”<br />
<br />
Joanna, gorgeous as she was, looked every bit as intimidating as her formerly male self had. Her eyes carried a steely determination, and try as he might, Rob could not free himself from the tall girl&#39;s amazonian grip.<br />
<br />
“Swear an oath to me that you will leave Bill alone and never bother him again” she demanded.<br />
<br />
Rob gulped.<br />
<br />
“S-sure thing, honey” he said. “I swear. Bill&#39;s dead to me. I&#39;ll never look in his direction ever again.”<br />
<br />
Joanna wanted to grab his balls and squeeze them until they liquefied, but when she recognized the look of subjugation in Rob&#39;s eyes, she let him go. Rob, embarrassed, walked down the hallway and around the corner with his tail between his legs. The entire student body started clapping and hollering their support for Joanna.<br />
<br />
“I wish my girlfriend could do that for me” said Tom Ackerman to another student within earshot of Gloria Vanapoulos, who fumed at being shown up.<br />
<br />
Bill grinned. He momentarily felt that he should be embarrassed that his girlfriend was apparently the dominant one in the relationship and he was the damsel in distress that needed to be rescued, but he put macho bullshit for aside for now and came to realize realized that finally, after seventeen years, he was living his best life.</p>
