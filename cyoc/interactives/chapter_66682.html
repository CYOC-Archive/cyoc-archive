<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The arrival of mating season for Molly and was not the quietest of things. We both tried to be as quiet as we could, though when two adult tigers engage in repeated sexual couplings... roars that are audible for miles in any direction are a given. Molly and I couldn't devote all our time to sex, obviously, as we still had our respective jobs, though the school had one more day before they let out for Christmas Break, but Officer Barnes and I would then transfer back to patrol duty. And we would remain there until school started again on January 2, 2013. And from there, things would depend on how Officer Howard's interviews with prospective DARE officers went.<br />
<br />
There was also the issue of meals. Many wild animals didn't eat during their respective mating seasons. Bull Elk and Moose lost a large amount of their body fat during their fall mating season. Lions and Tigers didn't eat all that often in their mating seasons. But Molly and I didn't quite have that sort of situation. By technicalities around the definition of the word &quot;wild&quot; and the fact that we weren't in a cage, we could be classified as &quot;wild animals&quot;, but our lives didn't mirror the lives of Bengal Tigers in India. We hunted, yes, but that largely supplemented what we bought from the market or from the Kalispell Walmart when we had errands down there. The bulk of our diet was store bought beef and pork. And in that, we probably had more in common with the various Tigers in zoos around the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another good reason to get help from Clemens, I guess,&quot; I commented on the last morning before Christmas Break.<br />
<br />
I was in the garage and collecting the meat for Molly's and my breakfast as well as what would be cooked for our respective lunches. Our dinners were eaten raw, to maximize the time we felt we needed to insure that Molly would become pregnant, but breakfast and lunch was still cooked. The meat we ate for lunch had special attention paid to it, as while we could digest raw meat, we knew that people might be a little grossed out by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that, dear?&quot; Molly called from the kitchen where she was preparing all the equipment for cooking breakfast and lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just thinking over things,&quot; I commented, as I returned to the kitchen with the meat in hand, &quot;and what Clemens might be able to help us with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Patten sent our request for help yesterday,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;we should get a reply this evening, I think... although that depends on how much work he has to do to get the information.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;yeah... but I was thinking things over... and it probably was a good decision, for reasons other then working directly with pregnant animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed to peak Molly's curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Largely related on the differences between wild and zoo animals,&quot; I commented, &quot;I mean, look at the comparative life spans. A Bengal Tiger can live up to twenty six years, but because of the threat of injuries sustained in hunting, or fighting over mates or territory among males, they're lucky to live to be fifteen years of age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And zoo tigers don't have the constant strains of hunting or fighting,&quot; Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in that way... we are fairly similar to a zoo tiger,&quot; I gave a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we hunt, and I had to kill that Mountain Lion to save Megan,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but we don't hunt all year and we don't depend on hunting for food,&quot; I answered, &quot;the bulk of our diet is probably the same as that of a zoo tiger, and the incident with the Mountain Lion was an isolated one. I doubt we'll have to deal with that a lot... and even still, you had about two hundred extra pounds of muscle on that Mountain Lion. We haven't... or at least I haven't had to fight an animal of comparable size and strength to myself. We had the Forest Service... Game Warden trap and relocate the bear that had come around here. And so, since we aren't putting as much strain on our bodies as a mundane tiger in the wild would...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A zoo tiger would be the more appropriate comparison,&quot; Molly sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which will put greater importance on Clemens' reply,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And the day went quietly. Or least quiet in the sense that there was no trouble that required action from Officer Barnes and myself. There was, however, a fair amount of noise related to the High School students enjoying the last day of school before Christmas break. When I met up with Molly again after school, she reported that the Elementary School students were similarly excited. Many of them apparently told Molly what they wanted for Christmas, and a couple even asked Molly what she wanted from Santa. Molly told me that the answer she gave was simply, &quot;a family&quot;. It probably confused the kids a bit, it would be better then trying to explain the &quot;birds and the bees&quot; to them.<br />
<br />
And the afternoon and early evening continued with our rounds of mating to insure that Molly would become pregnant and that we would become parents. That went as quietly as we could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have to quit earlier tonight then on other nights,&quot; I said to Molly at about seven o'clock as we paused our mating and prepared for dinner, &quot;patrol work starts earlier then DARE work does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... going back on patrol,&quot; Molly replied, though her tone indicated that she wasn't happy with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be fine, Molly,&quot; I told her, &quot;we'll be successful and we will have a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
It a gesture of assurance on my part, but I didn't have more that I could give her. And with the importance we'd put on having a family, I was sure Molly wanted a bit more assurance then a promise to be successful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish there would be more assurance then promises,&quot; Molly said with a sigh, &quot;For what if they keep you busy enough that I don't get enough stimulation to ovulate? I want to be a mother, George... I NEED to become a mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly hugged her, &quot;I know. I know what I have may not be enough to give a one hundred percent guarantee that our mating will be successful... but I suppose we'll need to take some things on faith. And besides, we should have Clemens' reply by now. We can check that after dinner. Maybe he has something that will help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Molly said weakly.<br />
<br />
And check we did. Following dinner, we did check Molly's Email. Sure enough, Clemens reply was there. Reading it gave a lot of cheer to Molly's mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eighteen to twenty days,&quot; Molly breathed, &quot;That's longer then the week long period we expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and reinforces the zoo versus wild comparison,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
&quot;That should be plenty of time to make sure we get a bun or two in the proverbial oven,&quot; Molly looked up at me with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... take a look at the attachments,&quot; I urged, &quot;Maybe he's found some graphs and charts or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
She did. The attachments proved to have little to do with our situation. Instead they had a lot to do with things related to the Animatrix Serum. Things including finding some way to get the serum's active life to stop after the person who's taken it has assumed their Animal-Person form, including various forms of contraception. It was an interesting thing, for sure, and also understandable. If left on its own, the Animatrix Serum would through generations begin to lead to the extinction of the human race through transformation. No one would be killed in this extinction, but the people would all become some species of animal. Thankfully though, that was at worst a millennium off. And at best, Leon would find something that would end the serum's active life after transformation. <br />
<br />
Thought that might create separate problems. Would an Animal-Person and a human be genetically compatible if they wanted to have children, even if one didn't want to become an Animal Person? And then there were the issues of size. Now for a female, that might not be too big of an issue, but for a male, his size would be important. While my member did have the spurs near the base that was a hallmark of all male cats, its size and shape was in human-style proportions to my body. Fully erect, I doubted my member could enter a human female without causing her serious pain, and that would be before the spines at its base cut into her own reproductive organs. Which would mean that any Animal-Person that would be larger then a human male, would likely lose the ability to please his love sexually. Now, there was more to love then sex, but it was fairly common that problems related to consummation could break couples apart... it would mean that even if a couple were still compatible, they would need to rely on artificial insemination to start a family.<br />
<br />
The attachment that got the most attention, however, was the one related to the man who had become a &quot;European Wolf&quot; and had his health dramatically improve as a result.<br />
<br />
&quot;It cured cancer?&quot; Molly gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;And apparently a heart condition,&quot; I nodded, &quot;though I don't entirely know for sure if that's entirely the Animatrix Serum or something else. Most of the news on animals having some resistance to cancer has been related to various shark species. But you never know... I suppose. And while the guy will need to be wary of Rabies and various canine diseases, just as we need to be wary of Rabies and various feline diseases, the fact that the Serum seems to be countering the man's cancer would have to be a plus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would seem that Leon is succeeding in what he originally set out to do,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;Though... I wonder... what is a European Wolf? I thought there was only the Grey Wolf and the Red Wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was a bit off of the original topic related to the attachment and sparked by curiosity. I wasn't sure and Molly quickly ran an Internet search on the species. The result came down to a &quot;wikipedia&quot; site. According to it, the European Wolf is a Grey Wolf subspecies, just as the Bengal Tiger was a subspecies of Tiger. In much of its range it had been eradicated in Europe by European hunters, but was beginning to recolonize former parts of its range.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing,&quot; Molly spoke as she began to shut our computer down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as amazing as you,&quot; I said to her and nuzzled her firmly, indicating that I was ready for the late evening mating session.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And here is our resident noise maker,&quot; Officer Howard said with a chuckle as I made my way into the station the next morning.<br />
<br />
It was not the greeting I expected, and I found myself looking down and embarrassed. Molly and I tried to be as quiet as possible, though there was question of how successful our efforts were. It appeared that we weren't that successful.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've tried to keep it down, sir,&quot; I said, sounding very much like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure, and it hasn't been too bad,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;Though I'll need to ask, what's triggered all this activity on the home front?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly is in heat, sir,&quot; I answered, again sounding embarrassed, &quot;we're trying to start a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A family?&quot; Officer Howard commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I answered, &quot;we're hoping that by the summer, Molly will be ready to give birth to cubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, given the effort you two have been making, I hope your successful,&quot; Officer Howard answered with a chuckle, &quot;anyway, you and Officer Barnes know how to run your patrols, so I'll leave the two of you to it. Be careful though. We haven't gotten any big blizzards yet, but the ice and snow still plays havoc on car tires.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes nodded beside me and we then continued on. From there, we resumed the patrol work that I had started on and what Officer Barnes preferred. Things went quietly with no real criminal activity, in the sense of robberies, murders, that sort of thing. That did not mean that the day was not without other excitements. There was one guy who had spun out on the ice going through town. By some miracle he managed to avoid hitting anybody, but we were still called to the scene. He admitted to overdriving the road conditions and looked to be extremely grateful to be alive.<br />
<br />
The only other &quot;event&quot; that Officer Barnes had to confront that day was in the late afternoon to early evening. We'd pulled over a guy who had apparently gotten plastered at a Christmas party and was driving his car at three miles an hour on the shoulder. It resulted in a one hundred yard low speed pursuit until he pulled over. It was near the end our shift, and Officer Barnes offered to take him in on his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sure?&quot; I asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd need to call another unit in anyway, and by the time we'd get back to station, our shift would be over,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, &quot;Besides, you and Molly have your family to start. Go on and have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a bit of humor in his voice that indicated that he was teasing a bit. Still, I thanked him all the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll owe you one,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Name a kid Frederick and we'll call it even,&quot; Officer Barnes said with a smile and then pulled away.<br />
<br />
I then slowly made my way home.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And the days between the beginning of the school's Christmas Break and December twenty-fifth passed much like that. By day I went in to work and carried out the patrols with Officer Barnes. Molly stayed behind and either kept the house, bought additional meat, or even visited with Frank Rhoer and her cousins. At night, we engaged in our efforts start a family. Clemens' Email had provided Molly with a great sense of relief. And his comments were proved right and helpful. As Molly and I drifted off to sleep on Christmas Eve, Molly didn't think she was pregnant... that she still felt the need.<br />
<br />
Molly and I awoke on December 25 at around eight in the morning. Being Christmas day, I was on an &quot;on call&quot; status. I'd only need to go if something came up that required me to go in. And that might not happen if things stayed quiet. That gave Molly and I an entire day to procreation. As I sat up and stretched, I picked up the same scent that Molly was producing since the eighteenth. She was still in heat. Clemens' prediction that her &quot;season&quot; would last longer then the one week that we had anticipated was correct, and came as a relief to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still smell good,&quot; I said to Molly and nuzzled her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Molly answered, and nuzzled me back, &quot;because I still need you...&quot;<br />
<br />
I could feel my penis growing erect and sliding out of its sheath in response to Molly's scent. I wanted nothing more then to continue, but we would need breakfast first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get something to eat before we do anything else,&quot; I told her and got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... we finally get a day where we can go all day and you'd rather eat?&quot; Molly asked, trying to sound hurt, but making it fairly obvious that she was faking it, &quot;Do I disgust you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I shook my head, &quot;You are sexiest person I know... and your scent is very arousing... but we'll both need to keep our energy up. You don't want me to pass out halfway in, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly shook her head, chuckling at some of the innuendos that had been passed between the two of us.<br />
<br />
Breakfast went by quietly, though there was nothing we could do to hide our arousal. With our minds focused on conceiving cubs and with no other responsibilities, neither of us were dressed. My erect member was a clear sign of what my reaction to Molly's scent, and I could see her nipples standing out on her breasts. Her reaction to the aroused scent I was probably giving off. And once breakfast was finished we moved to what was on our minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmm!&quot; Molly moaned as I nuzzled her and massaged one of her breasts, &quot;Put it in me!&quot;<br />
<br />
I complied and felt Molly's paws grip my member to help guide me into her opening. The pleasure from the &quot;friction&quot; of my penis against Molly's vaginal walls was immediate and I began to thrust into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... sorrrrrrrrrrrrry... if my... spines... hurrrrrrrrrrt... you,&quot; I moaned to her. It wasn't a particularly sexy thing to say, I knew they did hurt and I couldn't get away from the &quot;sap&quot; that I was that couldn't stand to see Molly in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;If... it... conceives... cubs... I... don't... carrrrrrrrrre... thrrrrrrrust!&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
And again I obeyed. I thrust my hips forward and back, moving my member in and out of her. My thrusts grew stronger as we went along. I felt Molly's paws move to my backside with one finger rubbing at the base of my tail where she &quot;aided&quot; in my thrusts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooorrrrrrrrrrmm... yes...&quot; Molly moaned, &quot;harrrrrrderrrrrr!&quot;<br />
<br />
I thrust harder and moved to lick one of her nipples. I could also hear myself giving growling moans of my own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harrrrrrderrrrrrr!&quot; Molly repeated, &quot;ooorrrrrrrrrrrm... I need... I need... I...rrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRM!&quot;<br />
<br />
I continued to thrust as hard as I could. Molly continued to grip my member firmly, and judging by the increased volume of Molly's moans, I guessed I was doing a good job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harrrrrrrrrrrrrrderrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Georrrrrrrrrrrrge,&quot; Molly urged again, &quot;I'm close... I'm... I'm... rrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM! HARRRRRRRRRRRRDERRRRRRRRRRRRR!&quot;<br />
<br />
I thrust as hard as I could and tried to pick up the pace. I was close to cumming, and I guessed Molly was getting close to that as well. I picked up the pace to get closer to that. With that, we'd then break for a few moments before starting again. It was intended to get Molly pregnant, and I was determined that our mating season would be successful. And then my orgasm hit.<br />
<br />
&quot;RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!&quot; I roared as I erupted inside Molly. Molly roared below me as her vaginal walls clamped down on the base of my penis. I could not tell how much of it was her orgasm or the pain from the spines on my penis &quot;cutting&quot; through her inner walls.<br />
<br />
I then collapsed down on top of Molly and then rolled off of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wonderful, George,&quot; Molly said after a few moments and rubbed one paw along the bottom of my jaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; I gave a weak smile, &quot;We'll need to wait a bit before I can get &quot;up&quot; again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may not need to,&quot; Molly informed me, &quot;I felt a bit of a tingle when we climaxed. I think I ovulated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
I reflexively sniffed as we laid there. Molly was still producing the mating scent at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still smell good,&quot; I said to her, &quot;and it'd be better to be safe then sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, my big... strong... sexy... male...&quot; Molly then nuzzled me, &quot;I love you, you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you too, Molly,&quot; I told her as I felt my member begin to return to an erect form and I could see Molly's nipples begin to stiffen, &quot;and together we will love our cubs forever.&quot;</p>
