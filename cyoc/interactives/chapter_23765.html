<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty had a thing for his next door neighbor. Him and his twin sister, but he always had his eye on one of them. Which was Cody, he was a sure sight to see. He was 6,4 and filled out with well chiseled muscles. His hair was wavy and blonde, think upon his head, and he had gentle blue eyes. A smile that could make anyone melt, in other words he was perfect!<br />
<br />
This guy was actually worth drooling over since he could return his feelings to Ty. Meaning that he and his twin sister had something in common, they both preferred men. His parent's took Dustin out to the mall to buy new clothes for him, which would take over a few hours, seeing how he needed a whole new wardrobe. <br />
<br />
Ty decided invite him over, they weren't friends per-say, but they were close to one. Ty peered out the window waiting to see Cody walk over to his house. A few minutes later he saw Cody walk out his home, and slowly walked up to the sidewalk, and over to Ty's house. Ty got a look what he was wearing, a tight muscle shirt and blue denim jeans, along with some new Nikes.<br />
<br />
He knocked on Ty's door, in which Ty answered quickly to. Ty smiled and greeted Cody.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Cody, what's up!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody walked inside Ty's home and replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been better,  but at least I can play games with a buddy, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded and showed Cody up to his room, in which he had wished a big Plasma screen TV and a super game system, that could play any game ever invented. Once Cody saw all of this new stuff, he gawked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! When did you get all of this sweet stuff!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty didn't know whether to lie, or to tell him the truth, He couldn't really trust Cody, seeing how they were only weekend buddies and all. But, he didn't want to lie to him either. Ty sat on his bed and simply said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody stared at Ty for a moment and laughed. While Cody was distracted Ty decided to check Cody's crotch. Which was well portioned with the rest of his body, making a bulge in the front of his jeans. Cody looked back at Ty, which he had just glanced away in time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right, it was magic, so it was like, HOCUS POCUS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody made wiggling gestures with his arms in the air, like an evil sorcerer or a crazy witch would do. Ty smiled and replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you don't believe me, how can I change your mind? Oh wait, never mind...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty had a sly grin on his face, he looked at Cody and winced, as he wished for Cody to become larger. Cody tilted his head to the side, wondering what Ty was doing, then he felt warm all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, did it just get hot in here, Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but maybe you'd like to look down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody cocked his eyebrow again, and just looked down. He noticed something... his chest seemed to heave out, becoming harder and more formed. Like a giant bodybuilder's pecs and not a seventeen year old's. Soon his abs followed gaining another row of slabbed muscle. His arms and legs ballooned to proportion, now his shirt and jeans tore apart in unison, falling away from his new, buffer body, only covered in tight boxers shorts. Cody was speechless as he felt his newly formed self and looked up at Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this... for real? What the hell... I'm a freakin beast! And... you did this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded and grimed. He walked up to Cody placing his hand on his extremely broadened shoulder. He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my friend, your not done growing yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody was yet again puzzled, as Ty started to back away. Cody felt a tingling in his cock. He looked down to see a bigger bulge form in the front of his boxers, growing longer and thicker. He knew his balls where swelling along with his already large endowment. Soon his genitals snapped the boxers off, which flung hard towards the door. He turned around to Ty's mirror and saw himself, he was truly perfect now. He looked down at his giant slab of meat. It grew from eight inches long and four inches thick, to three foot long and one and a half feet thick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... I'm a god!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody started to fell horny, his penis started to get hard. He backed away from the mirror to let it harden without any interference. Ty stared at his handy-work and chuckled. He went up to Cody and began stroking his large member. Cody's eyes widened, but he settled down immediately, Ty's touch felt soft, light, and warm. He started to quietly moan, just barely, but enough to notice it.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Cody... I can re-shape you, I can make you a god among men... I can make you ten times as perfect then you were, just like I did now. So what do you say, you keep this little secret between us, and we'll have good times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody started to moan louder at the thought of becoming larger, and overall perfect. Eventually he shot hot, gooey, seamen all over Ty's wall and fell to the floor. He was breathing hard and felt his throbbing member settle down. Ty made Cody's old clothes fit his new body, so he wouldn't get cold. He wished away Cody's mess, which he wish he had time to clean it off by himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody rolled onto his back, smiling his perfectly straight, white, blinding smile. And pulled Ty on top of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure I will, just the two of us it is then!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody leaned up and kissed Ty for a long time. While Ty was frozen, frozen at the fact that he had made his ultimate fantasy come true. Once he pulled away, Cody stood up with a little trouble due to his new size. Ty shrank Cody back down, leaving his member at one foot and a half long, half a foot thick and his ball sack the size of a watermelon. Cody stood up with ease, this time around and itched his crotch, like most guys do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us see what we can do today then...Whatdaya say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody took Ty's hand and jerked him all the way to the front door. Ty kept thinking of what type of fun he and Cody would have today.</p>
