<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jen left the cafeteria she was glad the students were so loud today.  Their noise seemed to cover the crinkling of her rubber thighs as she walked.  The noise may not be caring too much but Jen could feel the sound through her body.<br />
<br />
The hallway was empty of students.  The long straight hall was awash in reflections from the lights bouncing off the waxed floor and the metal lockers.  Placing one light foot in front of the other Jen could feel her lower-half responding sluggishly to her commands.  It was as if her body were alien to her.  Her knees felt stiff and bent reluctantly.  Her thighs and calves felt as if they were wrapped in thick cotton.  Every sensation felt deadened and muffled.  Her hips wobbled as she walked, twisting back and forth as if her legs could not make the proper movement at her hip joints.  She tried to focus her mind on her crotch trying to see through her clothing and get some inkling of her vague body.  It was as if she were looking at her legs while standing waist deep in water; everything seemed unable to fall into focus.<br />
<br />
Jen's mind was running fast as she ambled slowly toward the bathroom.  That ass, Kyle, had cursed her good.  She tried to understand the sort of mind that would turn a girl into a sex-toy.  Jen knew she was sexy so what was the point of making her inanimate?  To be used?  Humiliated?  Or was it just to make life more complicated?  She just could not think strait.  What would become of her if she could not move and was all alone?  Would she be stuck like this forever?<br />
<br />
Jen reached the girls room and pushed through the door.  It was empty, surprisingly.  Jen tried her best to see herself in the mirror.  Pulling up her shirt she could see the line of peachy rubber was under her navel.  She almost thought she could see it moving but figured that with more than half a day left in the transformation it would be moving too slow.  Letting her shirt fall she lowered her skirt to her knees.  Her thighs were the same flawless rubber.  Under her socks she could see the peach colour ran right down to her shoes.  Kicking them off and pulling her socks off she found her bare feet were rubber skinned and had fused toes.  Wiggling them slowly Jen thought it too much like having tight rubber socks instead of her actual body parts had lost definition.<br />
<br />
Jen thought it was odd that Kyle even knew what a sex doll looked like.  She wanted to laugh at Kyle for not being able to get any kind of women except an inflatable one, but she wondered how someone even went about buy such a thing.  She tried to make a list in her mind of all the sex toys she could name and it was very short.  Perhaps Kyle knew more about these things than most normal people.  Again she wondered what someone would think to find a random rubber doll dressed up like a cheer leader just randomly placed.  Was it the sort of thing someone, anyone would just take home and fuck?<br />
<br />
She sat on a toilet to replace her socks and found that her legs wanted to spread for her.  Unable to bend her knees without great effort putting her socks back on was difficult.  It took a couple of times for each foot but finally she was able to redress her odd feet.  She hobbled back to her shoes and stepped into them.  As she tried to pull her skirt up she found something new.  Her bottom was starting to inflate.<br />
<br />
Under her hands she could feel the cheeks pushing against her.  They swelled slowly but her ass was becoming more and more round.  Two oddly domed blobs were swelling behind her.  She pulled her skirt over them.  The waist band forced them together and they squeaked loudly against each other.  When they bounced back into shape Jen found that it lifted the back of her skirt up noticeably.  She tried to pull the skirt down low on her hips to help hide the change but her ass stuck out too much to let the elastic band stay put.<br />
<br />
Great, Jen thought, now I have to walk around presenting my rear to everyone.  She practiced walking from one side of the room to the other.  Her butt bounced and wobbled as she walked.  Occasionally her cheeks would meet each other and squeak loudly.  There was no way to walk without drawing attention to her rear end.<br />
<br />
Jen cursed loudly.  There was no way of hiding this change.  Everyone would see her.  They would know that she was becoming a sex toy and they might try to do something about it.  But then Jen had a new thought.  Why was she even trying to hide her change?<br />
<br />
Her friend had done that thing with a banana as if it was a common occurrence.  People had hooted as if her friend was doing some stupid stunt with an object.  If Jen did not get people to notice her change then they would just end up treating her as a toy.  A simple toy that no one would ever care about.  The only way to turn back to normal was to have someone use her.  She needed someone to use her before she was nothing more important than a balloon.<br />
<br />
Jen rushed to the door and out into the hall, looking for someone to use her like a toy.  As she ran, her bulbous ass wobbled and bounced to a cacophony of squeaks.</p>
