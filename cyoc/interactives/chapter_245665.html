<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was about to sit down at the last computer terminal in a long row of computers where he could use the free internet which the public library was offering for its visitors, when a girl sat down at the terminal right next to him. <br />
<br />
The girl had long, blonde hair and she looked tall and athletic. She wore shorts and she sported a soccer jersey. She was also carrying a sports soft bag along strapped over her shoulder which she set down on the floor next to her. Then, she took her cell phone and call someone, which allowed Ty to eavesdrop on the conversation without her knowing it. <br />
<br />
“Hi Cheryl? Yes, it’s me, Erin! Yes, practice was great! I scored one goal today! I trained really hard today. I’m so jealous of the guys sometimes, you know? Some of these boys are big and tall and they have all the muscle, but they don’t use them! I swear! Some of these guys are like overgrown babies! They are so lazy! They just want to play video games all day long. I hate that! No ambition or desire to go do something productive at all. Oh, gosh… Here comes one of these losers right now…” the girl said quietly as a boy walked by. <br />
<br />
A tall, skinny boy strolled by, swinging his backpack on the table and then sitting down in a chair with a deep sigh. The boy was over 6 feet tall, but he seemed out of shape and tired from just walking up the stairs. The girl looked at him with utter disgust as the boy pulled out his cell phone and started playing a video game on the device. <br />
<br />
“Let me call you back, okay?” Erin said, as she hung up the call on her cell phone before walking up to the boy who sat at the table. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Kenny!” she said to him. He just rolled his eyes and sighed. <br />
<br />
“What do you want, Erin? I’m playing my game. Leave me alone!” he grumbled. <br />
<br />
“You’re always playing games on your stupid phone while they need more players on the guys’ soccer team! Here you are, you’re big and tall, yet you just waste your time on your phone. Why don’t you do something productive with your life, for a change?” she said to him. <br />
<br />
“Who are you, my mother? Gosh, you talk just like her! Go away and leave me alone!” was the only thing he said to her. <br />
<br />
“Useless… Big useless lug! When are you gonna do something useful with your life, huh?” she growled as she walked away. <br />
<br />
She sat at the table near where Ty was and she quietly shed a few tears as she was trying to concentrate on searching some information on the web. Obviously, she had a hard time concentrating since she was so upset. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Hi… Umm… Are you alright?” Ty asked her quietly. <br />
<br />
“Oh… Well, you probably heard everything…” Erin spoke while trying to fight back tears. “I need to work so damn hard just to keep my spot on the soccer team while this big lug, who is over 6 feet tall, is too damn lazy to play any sport or to go to the gym and lift weights. All he cares about is playing those stupid video games all day long and he’s just wasting his life away when there are so many sports teams in school where they could use him right now.” Erin said to him. “He has everything going for him to be a great athlete, but he’s so incredibly LAZY. On the other hand, I have to work incredibly hard just to play soccer because I’m a girl. It’s so unfair!” <br />
<br />
Ty looked at the boy, who just sat there, playing the game on his phone. Then, he turned back and looked at the girl, who was sitting at the table next to him. What if he could bring the two together and merge them into one body? If the girl could be in charge of the boy’s body and give him her outgoing personality, then he would be a great athlete, right? <br />
<br />
“I know the solution to this problem! He has the height and the muscles, but you got the desire and the personality to be a winner and a great athlete! So, I’m gonna merge you with Kenny, Erin!” Ty cheered. “I want the two of you to merge into one person… Right now!” <br />
<br />
“What? Me and Kenny? Merge? What are you talking--?” Erin stammered, when she was suddenly forced to stand up by some unknown, invisible power while Ty looked on with a big grin on his face. <br />
<br />
“Ohhh… Nooooo! What’s happening? Help me!” Erin shouted. “HELP!” <br />
<br />
Luckily, there were no other people sitting in that section of the library, so nobody heard her shouting. <br />
<br />
Erin began to slide across the carpet towards where Kenny was sitting. Then, Kenny suddenly dropped the cell phone on the floor and stood up to face her. <br />
<br />
“HEY! What’s this? Why am I standing?” he gasped. <br />
<br />
Both Kenny and Erin were being pulled towards each other like magnets by an invisible force! When they finally touched, Erin’s body became absorbed into Kenny’s taller frame, and the two of them were engulfed in an intense bright, white light which blinded all three of them, including Ty. <br />
<br />
A few seconds later, only Kenny was standing there and Erin was gone. She had completely disappeared as Ty got up and walked over to the taller boy. <br />
<br />
Kenny looked more muscular and athletic this time, and he looked down on Ty with a smile this time. <br />
<br />
“Kenny? Are you alright?” Ty asked him. <br />
<br />
“Kenny? My name is Kevin!” the taller boy responded. Suddenly, Ty noticed that Kenny was wearing a soccer jersey, socks and shin guards. Kenny was also walking and moving around much faster than before. “I need to go to the gym so I can get a quick workout in!” <br />
<br />
Ty just looked on and smiled. His wish worked and he merged Erin and Kenny together into a new boy with their combined body and personality. Now, Kevin was eager to work out and train in the gym. <br />
<br />
Kevin squatted down and grabbed the soft bag off the floor. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty! I’m playing a soccer game tomorrow at 3. Wanna come watch my game?” the tall, athletic boy asked him. <br />
<br />
“Sure! I’ll come to cheer you on, Ken… Kevin!” Ty shouted, as Kevin quickly waved to him and ran towards the exit of the library, leaving Ty all by himself. <br />
<br />
“Great! I solved that problem! I wonder who else I can merge using my powers?” Ty chuckled quietly to himself.</p>
