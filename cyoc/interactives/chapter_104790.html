<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Author&#39;s note: This is a continuation of our previous episode &quot;Sex Talk: The Brothers Anderson&quot;.<br />
All sex mentioned between the ladies is in regards to past or future activities and it&#39;s never easy being a teenager; regardless of when, where, what, or who you are/were.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
After Eric Anderson left her house, Spencer Lawson set the table for dinner before returning to her homework. When her mother Maggie arrived home from work, Spencer helped her prepare the meal so that by the time Evan Lawson returned home from the military base he was stationed at, everything was ready.<br />
Since she had been debating whether or not to do so anyway, when the question of &quot;How was school?&quot; came up, Spencer decided to tell her parents everything.<br />
To say they were shocked about Julie Stovall&#39;s after school actions towards Eric would be an understatement. If they were displaying their fursonas right now, Maggie&#39;s fur would be stiff with claws fully extended while Evan&#39;s werewolf would be growling; both looking to make sushi out of a certain were-mermaid.<br />
&quot;Obviously Martin Stovall wasn&#39;t able to talk to his daughter until sometime after that,&quot; realized Evan, after he managed to calm down.<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully Julie is a were of her word. Besides, it&#39;s not like we can prove what happened, unless Eric did become a were-merman and none of us want that,&quot; pointed out Maggie, worried how her daughter would react if that did happen.<br />
&quot;But while we have absolutely no idea how long Julie will keep her promise, Eric and I may not have to worry about her for much longer anyway. We found a cooperative werepanthress!&quot; announced Spencer happily.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said her father with a raised eyebrow of surprise.<br />
&quot;Is Eric still on board with this?&quot; wondered Maggie.<br />
&quot;Becoming a panther was his idea, as the best logistical mate to my hybrid form. <i>Little</i> Eric&#39;s going to be sidelined for another day or so, but by this weekend...&quot;<br />
Both parents gave Spencer a stern look.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Both Frieda Knight and I are on our respective were birth control pills,&quot; said Spencer, to qualm her folks worries. <i>Actually, I&#39;ve got to double check on Frieda, but anyway...</i> &quot;But she wants a night with me alone before she helps Eric.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; This time it was Spencer&#39;s mother who arched her eyebrow.<br />
&quot;Hey, you have your... <i>friends</i>,&quot; replied Spencer, giving her a knowing look. &quot;She&#39;s supposed to call later to set up the arrangements.&quot;<br />
And then, as if on cue, Spencer&#39;s cellphone chimed; but it was just announcing Nate Anderson&#39;s incoming text message.<br />
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH ERIC BECOMING A WERE. HE TRULY LOVES U. BUT FEAR OF JULIE IS STILL BUGGING HIM, SO PLEASE MAKE SURE HIS HEAD IS ON STRAIGHT & ERIC KNOWS THE FULL DETAILS OF WHAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP U 2 WILL HAVE BEFORE HE DOES.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything all right?&quot; asked Evan.<br />
&quot;Just another friend with a homework question,&quot; was Spencer&#39;s reply. &quot;I&#39;ll answer it after dinner,&quot; she added, hastily putting the phone back in her pocket so she wouldn&#39;t be questioned any more about it.<br />
After dinner, Spencer helped her mother clear the table before going to her room to continue her homework, after typing &quot;K. WILL DO. THANK U&quot; in reply to Nate.<br />
It was about a half hour later when Frieda Knight finally called. &quot;Hey girl. What&#39;s up? How&#39;s Eric?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Not much. Doing homework. Eric&#39;s psyche took more damage than his penis, but at least his cock will be good again in another day or so.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good. So...&quot; began Frieda, &quot;I was thinking. Friday night for just us ladies, and Saturday night for the threesome.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; replied Spencer, thinking of all the things she&#39;d have to talk to Eric about. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, can we talk? I like to get to know my perspective partners a little better first,&quot; she said, laying out across her bed.<br />
&quot;Sure. Ask me anything you want. I&#39;ll do the same,&quot; responded Frieda.<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, to get my mom off my back if she asks again, are you on birth control?&quot;<br />
&quot;You better believe it! I don&#39;t want any babies until long after I&#39;ve graduated college and am on my own,&quot; proclaimed Frieda. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, although mine has to be specially made because of my hybrid nature. How about a little bit about your background?&quot; requested Spencer, staring at the ceiling.<br />
&quot;Naturally born, pure bred werepanthress. Bi by choice, not genetics. I can tell you why if you&#39;d like to know,&quot; offered Frieda.<br />
&quot;Only if you&#39;re willing to.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind. Being kind of a late bloomer, my first transformation wasn&#39;t until the previous school year let out for this past summer,&quot; began Frieda. &quot;My folks arranged for this panther from down the street to be my... companion for the big event. He took my virginity, which wasn&#39;t too bad, I guess. I mean, I had nothing to compare the experience to. Besides, between the heat of the moment and having my first transformation, I couldn&#39;t tell you one anxiety from another, let alone if any pain I experienced was from something other than my hymen being broken.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; replied Spencer, kicking off her house slippers while unbuttoning her shirt some.<br />
&quot;Second time was definitely better. Then again, that could of just have been from the fact my cunt was so wet from transforming,&quot; continued Frieda. &quot;Then for the third time, he wanted anal, and considering the size of that thing and the fact that it was my first night, there was no way I was willing to do it then, but he wasn&#39;t going to take no for an answer.&quot;<br />
&quot;So it was always more about his pleasure than yours,&quot; said Spencer sympathetically, sitting up.<br />
&quot;Definitely. The jerk. Anyway, it looked like things were about to come down to a fight between him and me when this werepanthress I&#39;ve never met before came between us and sent him packing,&quot; said Frieda, thankfully. &quot;After he left, she and I just sat there for a while talking, but then were hormones and libidos started kicking in and...&quot;<br />
&quot;I get the idea,&quot; said Spencer, kicking off her blue jeans before laying back down on her bed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, she and I spent a marvelous summer together before she went back East to resume her college studies. She wants to be a doctor, but has a long way to go before realizing that goal. She was totally up front with me from the start that at best we were just a summer fling, but she did show me how great two ladies could be together and with her brother&#39;s help, I did learn a lot more about <i>proper</i> male/female relations, including anal.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been mounted from behind before, but have never taken it in the ass. What&#39;s it like?&quot; asked Spencer.<br />
&quot;You need a LOT of prep work and a caring partner, but once you get that far, it IS exciting,&quot; admitted Frieda. &quot;It probably isn&#39;t for everybody, but anal is a much tighter channel and you feel so much fuller. Plus, the orgasms are just as intense, if not more so. At least for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, are you and the brother...&quot; wondered Spencer, while tossing off her shirt, which left her in just her underwear.<br />
&quot;Just sexually, at group meetings,&quot; answered Frieda. &quot;They&#39;re both friends and there are times when I still miss her, but if it wasn&#39;t for both of them, especially her; I&#39;d probably be seriously messed up mentally. As it is, I&#39;m not looking for an actual relationship right now, so I&#39;m not even sure which gender I&#39;d pursue one with; but whenever the opportunity arises for some fun...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know the feeling,&quot; agreed Spencer. &quot;Besides having a little werecat in me as part of my hybrid nature, my folks are swingers. Mom will fuck <i>anybody</i> given the opportunity, while dad&#39;s straight and just shares women with her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow. My folks are pretty straight laced. The thought of doing it with anyone other than the person you&#39;re married to is like Kryptonite to them, and they don&#39;t even know about my bi tendencies,&quot; confessed Frieda, while privately wondering if there would ever be an opportunity to encounter the Lawsons somewhere. &quot;So when you come over Friday night, you&#39;ll have to tell them I invited you over for a slumber/get to know my high school friends better type party. Otherwise...&quot;<br />
&quot;I get you,&quot; said Spencer with a smile on her face, wondering just how much actual slumber they&#39;d get Friday night.<br />
&quot;So, your turn. I want to hear the Spencer Lawson story,&quot; requested Frieda.<br />
<br />
In the end, Spencer surprised herself by telling Frieda almost everything, from her early days to recent events including Jeremy Bower, Junior and Eric Anderson. She was fast growing fond of Frieda Knight and knew she could trust her.<br />
&quot;I am definitely well out of my bad boy phase now,&quot; Spencer confided in her. &quot;Eric is like no man I&#39;ve ever met before, especially considering he&#39;s only 14, but he acts so much older and more mature toward women, especially me.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, is he <i>the one</i>?&quot; wondered Frieda.<br />
&quot;If he ain&#39;t, Eric&#39;s certainly fooled me,&quot; confessed Spencer.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy for you both. So... how do you want to handle Saturday night?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, Eric will still have to make arrangements on his end, but considering his parents are swingers too,  its more a question of logistics than anything else. But what I was thinking was that we could start by having him eat you to a fantastic orgasm,&quot; began Spencer.<br />
&quot;Wait. I thought Eric&#39;s still a virgin.&quot;<br />
&quot;He is,&quot; confirmed Spencer, &quot;but I can give him pointers while you give him hands on experience. Then after he&#39;s had a big taste of your cream and has started transforming, if you don&#39;t mind, I thought Eric and I would have our first sex fuck as he becomes a werepanther,&quot; she added, while Spencer started caressing a bra covered breast with her free hand.<br />
&quot;You mean I don&#39;t get to take his virginity?&quot; asked Frieda, sounding a bit disappointed.<br />
&quot;Well, Eric and me doing it for his first time has kind of been on my mind for quite a while now,&quot; admitted Spencer.<br />
&quot;Understandable, but isn&#39;t there any way we can both take his virginity? I&#39;ve never been with one before.&quot;<br />
&quot;Neither have I. With my hybrid nature, there&#39;s no way of knowing what a normal would become if they have sex with me. So this arrangement between us and Eric may be the only time I ever get to have one,&quot; pointed out Spencer.<br />
&quot;Yeah. I can see that, so I guess you&#39;ll have that honor after all,&quot; agreed Frieda. &quot;But just what have you and Eric done?&quot;<br />
&quot;A lot of kissing and hugging. He&#39;s only played with my clothing covered breasts because I&#39;m afraid to let him suckle in case anything actually comes out of the nipples. I&#39;ve sucked his cock several times, which is MIGHTY tasty by the way, and Eric&#39;s discovered that my fursona&#39;s ears are a highly erogenous zone when massaged. But for some reason, I don&#39;t feel anything when he tries massaging them in my normal form.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Frieda, looking forward to trying that out for herself. &quot;No one&#39;s ever played with my ears, so I don&#39;t know whether or not they&#39;d have any sexual reaction in either form.&quot;<br />
&quot;For some reason, it also doesn&#39;t work when I try going solo in either form, but I&#39;d be more than happy to help you find out how sensitive yours are,&quot; offered Spencer with a smile on her face, as her free hand drifted down to her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;After Eric&#39;s become a were, the three of us will still...&quot;<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; promised Spencer. &quot;Besides, once he does go furry, you&#39;d still need to complete him before we can continue the fun, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely, and if Eric&#39;s a good panther, maybe I&#39;ll let him try anal with me too,&quot; said Frieda. &quot;But no promises. However, I have become fond of having my ass kissed and licked sometimes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Kinky. As long as it&#39;s clean, I&#39;ll give it a shot Friday night, but I can&#39;t make any promises on Eric&#39;s behalf for anal Saturday night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. But I do have one more request.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? What?&quot; wondered Spencer.<br />
&quot;Other than Freshman lunch with Eric, the three of us only see each other in the school hallways and if it wasn&#39;t for Julie, we&#39;d probably never know each other at all, but I&#39;d like us to start hanging out socially too,&quot; said Frieda. &quot;Being friends, if you can call it that and if we ever were to begin with, with Stovall has kept me in different social circles than other people. Most of the student body hasn&#39;t wanted much to do with me because of her. But even though she doesn&#39;t know it yet, now that me and Julie are through...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. While you are doing Eric and I a TREMENDOUS favor helping to usher him into were society, I was hoping we could be friends too,&quot; said Spencer, wanting to boost Frieda&#39;s confidence as much as tell her the truth. &quot;Between having just moved here at the start of the new school year and being a grade behind where I should be has been an awkward situation socially for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can see that, but you and Eric have a friend in me, and I now have a friend in you and him. Yet, as much as I&#39;d love to continue this conversation, I have to finish the rest of my homework; so I&#39;ll see you two at school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a date,&quot; promised Spencer. &quot;And I&#39;d have to check with Eric and see how he&#39;s feeling, but maybe we can hang out after school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; said Frieda, smiling, although Spencer couldn&#39;t see that over her cellphone. &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Night.&quot;<br />
<br />
After they broke the connection, Spencer looked at the homework she still had to do compared to the time. Eric Anderson had an 11 pm curfew, but she knew he&#39;d be in his room by now, so it would be safe to have a chat over the PC with him via Skype. She could finish the rest of her homework afterward.<br />
Spencer thought about putting some additional clothing back on first, but then just decided to make sure her bedroom door was secured before going to her terminal wearing only her bra and panties.<br />
<i>Eric could use the pick me up, and this way he knows I still love and am VERY interested in him,</i> she thought, logging into her Skype account after turning the computer on.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Unknown to Spencer, Frieda Knight had been lying in her bed, totally nude and furry as a werepanthress, playing with herself while talking to her new friend and future lover.<br />
One thing Frieda never liked admitting to anyone was how rich her parents were. They moved only in the best social circles Moon Lake and Washington state had available for weres, and wanted their only daughter to do the same, despite the fact she was more &quot;down to Earth&quot; than they were and that her parents were unaware of her sexual feelings.<br />
Because of her parents beliefs, that was why Frieda was stuck being friends with Julie Stovall to begin with, and because of Julie (even long before the were-mermaid&#39;s recently developed twisted thoughts of &quot;revenge&quot;), Frieda could never admit to having a bit of a crush on Eric Anderson.<br />
Yet since meeting Spencer Lawson, the werepanthress could not deny she was developing feelings for her either.<br />
As she now used both paws to work herself to another blissful orgasm, Frieda happily thought of the two of them both tomorrow and beyond.<br />
<i>&quot;As it is, I&#39;m not looking for an actual relationship right now, so I&#39;m not even sure which gender I&#39;d pursue one with...&quot;</i> was not totally true.<br />
<i>Since they both come from swinging families, maybe Eric and Spencer would like to be in a longer threesome with me than just a one night stand. Or maybe even a more permanent relationship,</i> the werepanthress thought hopefully, as her tail swished happily in time to her pleasurable shudders.</p>
