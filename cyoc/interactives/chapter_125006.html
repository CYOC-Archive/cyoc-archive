<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trent decided to go back to the gay bar to try out a new idea. He was a God now, and sure looked like one too, so he knew he wouldn’t have any trouble finding a willing partner. But he didn’t exactly want his partner to be willing. The merge with Ryan had been enough of that for him. No, now he wanted to dominate someone. And he knew just how to do it. But he needed some clothes first. He looked through his closet and drawers and found a nice outfit of tight jeans, a white v-neck, and a black leather blazer. Except when he tried to put them on, he discovered that they were tailored to his old body. And while he liked how tightly drawn they were on his new muscles, and how they accentuated certain bulges, on other parts of his body they felt uncomfortably tight and looked like they were going to rip. Trent was disappointed, until he realized he could simply absorb and regrow the clothing. His skin began to melt to welcome in the new addition, and in moments he was standing naked in front of his mirror again, admiring his perfectly sculpted form. Slowly he decided to recreate the clothes, and they grew out of his skin like extensions of his body, this time perfectly tailored to his new bulked form. A roguish smile and wink confirmed that he liked the look. What he didn’t like as much, though, was the fact that he could still feel through the clothes just as he could through the gloves. He wondered if he could change that. He willed his consciousness out of the fabric. It took a couple tries, but soon the clothes were just plain clothes, on a very sexy man. He headed back to the gay bar. <br />
<br />
When he entered, he got a lot of stares. He was clearly the most attractive guy there, and he now had a certain commanding aura about him, part of which he absorbed from Ryan and part of which was the result of the ring. He began to survey the crowd for his next prey. On the dance floor, he spotted an attractive arab guy dressed in blue jeans and a pink button-down. He was clearly a bodybuilder, and Trent could see thick veins snaking over his boulders of biceps and thick forearms, which threatened to tear the shirt that was drawn across his pecs. His jeans were also close to breaking, straining against a ballooning ass you could lay your drink on and thighs that seemed to have a life of their own. His skin was a dark, rich caramel, and he had shiny straight black hair and a thick, well-trimmed beard. The guy was hot. Supermodel hot. Trent glanced over and caught the man’s eye. The man seemed to like what he saw. A look of lust grew across his face. He headed over toward Trent, making eye contact and winking. A few minutes later they were making out violently on the dance floor, pulling hard on each other’s already super tight clothes. Trent reluctantly pushed Ahmed away from their tight kiss, and placed a finger on his mouth to silence his protests. “Let’s take this back to my place,” he said, and soon they were violently making out again in the backseat of a taxi. <br />
<br />
When they arrived at Trent’s appartment, neither of them had shirts on. Ahmed’s had ripped and Trent had removed his leather jacket and ripped open his white v-neck to match.  It’s not like he couldn’t repair both of them later. The two hulking figures were still feeling up each other’s thick, smooth arms, chests, and backs as they climbed the stairs and Trent unlocked his apartment. Trent was so ready to just merge this brown muscle stud into himself, but he had an even better idea how to do it, so he forced himself to wait. Once they were inside, Trent told Ahmed to lay down on the bed and get ready. Ahmed obliged, and began removing his pants.  The sight of the monster cock that sprung out was too much for Trent to process, so he quickly picked up Ahmed’s clothes and rushed into the bathroom. Before he shut the door, he told Ahmed to “wait right there; I have a special surprise for you,” before giving him Ryan’s trademark roguish wink. <br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, an evil grin spread across Trent’s face. He looked at his new shirtless body in the mirror. It was gorgeous; huge and tan, with perfectly smooth skin, like a god among men. But Ahmed’s was better. Even with the combined muscles and looks of Shawn and Ryan, Ahmed’s was better. Maybe it was the residual piece of Trent’s original body that was still inside him. He could deal with that issue later, though. Right now he just needed Ahmed’s body for his own. He needed complete control of it. And he needed to steal it from right under Ahmed’s own nose. He gave himself another wink before sucking his and Ahmed’s tattered clothes into himself. His jeans and shoes melted into his legs like water into a sponge. He was naked again, in all his muscular glory, except for those tight leather gloves. He concentrated, and moved all of the fabric to his right hand. Out of one of the fingers of his glove, he began to pull out a thick rope. This would do nicely. <br />
<br />
He left the bathroom and found Ahmed still lying expectantly on the bed. Ahmed eyed the rope in Trent’s hand and became excited. <br />
“You gonna tie me up, stud?” He asked. <br />
“Fuck yeah” was all Trent could say in his unbelievable horniness before going straight to work, knotting Ahmed to the bed. Ahmed didn’t even try to resist. Unbeknownst to him, however, Trent could already feel himself strained against Ahmed&#39;s superior muscles through the rope itself. <br />
“You ready for this?” Trent asked. Ahmed looked up to respond, and as he did so, Trent became a different person for a second; his hair changed to Shawn’s black, he grew chest hair, and his skin darkened. It was subtle, and he changed back instantly, but it was distinct enough to seriously unnerve Ahmed. <br />
“Wh.. what just happened to you?” He asked, scared. He began to strain against the ropes. <br />
“You’ll find out in a sec,” Trent responded, flashing Ryan’s wink, stretching his arms across his chest, and cracking his neck to prepare for what he was about to do.<br />
Ahmed was terrified. He froze for a second, then began pulling even harder at the ropes to try to escape.<br />
“Don’t worry babe, this won’t hurt a bit” Trent soothed in a sinister tone. <br />
“Help! Help!” Ahmed began to scream.<br />
“Well now that won’t do. Let’s make that stop.” <br />
<br />
Ahmed finally broke free with his bulging muscles. But right at the instant he did so, Trent disappeared. He had collapsed into a tan goo all over Ahmed’s legs. His leather gloves had fallen onto the floor. Ahmed was relieved, but disgusted. He tried to wipe it off before looking for his torn clothes, but only succeeded in getting his hands sticky. He walked over to the bathroom that Trent had taken his clothes into, exhausted after using all of his incredible manpower to break free from the ropes. But before he could reach the bathroom door, he heard a voice in his head go “looking for these?” And within a split second his clothes reformed tightly only his thick body out of the liquid, mended and everything. He stopped in his tracks. Something was still up. He tried to rush to the door, but the liquid jumped out at him and formed roped that chained him once again to the bed. He felt it slowly start creeping up over his clothes, starting at his legs and covering his chest until it was shooting tendrils over his neck. He was screaming and wrestling with the ropes the whole time, and whenever he would succeed in breaking one, it would regrow instantly. The liquid covered his mouth and silenced his screams. It shot down his throat and through his nose and ears, and began pushing its way up his ass. It came around the back of his head, covering his hair, until he looked over at the mirror and watched as it finally covered his eyes plunging him into darkness. He wrestled even harder, but it didn’t matter, because out of nowhere, maybe from the suffocation but maybe from something else entirely, he could no longer move his right arm. His left arm soon followed, and soon his legs stopped moving as well. Was he dead? He wasn’t sure. He couldn’t see or hear anything, and he certainly wasn’t breathing, but he could still feel everything his body felt. He felt what happened next: the liquid began seeping into his pores and orifices, and within a minute he could see and hear again, and he saw in the mirror that his hunk of a body that he had worked his entire life for was still intact, and fully clothed. Pretty sexily clothed too. But he still couldn’t move it, or even call for help. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like hours but was really only a minute or so, he saw and felt his body begin to breathe again, and eventually stand up. Without him asking it to. It started flexing in the mirror, ripping and reminding the pink button-down multiple times in the process. Finally it stood still, cracked its neck, and gave a little familiar smile and wink. Trent reached into his own chest, which liquified at his touch. He began to pull out another body, a smaller, thinner, paler figure. It was his original body. He had finally transcended it. He needed it no longer. He pushed the remains of Ahmed’s consciousness into the frail nude body, which, as soon as it had fully resolidified, began coughing and sputtering. Trent looked down on it with interest and disdain. He hated that old body so much. Now he had switched bodies with a God. Ahmed in Trent’s old body looked up at the new Trent, horrified. <br />
“What are you?” He managed to spurt out.<br />
“A monster,” Trent replied out-of-hand. He flexed again a little for Ahmed, before switching into his Shawn/Ryan form, now enhanced without his own body bogging it down. Then he shifted right back into Ahmed, and gave what was no longer a roguish smirk but was now an evil grin. He reached out a bulky arm, and touched Ahmed’s new body, which instantly dissolved into a puddle. He picked up the gloves that had fallen off earlier, slipped them back on, and went out into the night.</p>
