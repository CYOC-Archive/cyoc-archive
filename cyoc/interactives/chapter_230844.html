<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The drive to work was uneventful, Kyle would try to move his arms and Sheila would slap his hands down, she was obviously mad with him, but it was herself at the same time. She got them to work a few minutes early, so she pulled the make up out of her purse and did a quick job on his face. He tried to avoid the make up, but she had control over their head. She then reached into the back seat, setting up the sun shade, and pulling up a duffle bag.<br />
<br />
“See, I can&#39;t even dress my sons body properly,” Kyle grumbled to himself. “Good thing the curse changed reality.” Kyle tried to avoid being undress. “Stop it boy!” He heard himself yell and froze. “That&#39;s better, I got us into this, and we&#39;re stuck, at least fucking work with me.” Kyle stayed still, his instincts being that if his mother started actually cussing he really fucked up and should obey. Kyle was stripped down to his boxer briefs, then promptly dressed in a pair of business slacks, a white button down shirt, and a pair of dress shoes. “There, this is how I dress you form now on. Uncomfortable? Good, it&#39;s ride til you die with me now.” She got out of the care, carrying her limp son like a sack of potatoes braced against her. “Now act natural, I can&#39;t afford to lose composure here, I need to appear normal.”<br />
<br />
Kyle felt his face change expression to a fake happy smile, his mother&#39;s body started walking more softly, and elegantly, putting on an act like there was nothing wrong, Kyle complied with the bodies wishes. They passed the front desk, the secretary looked up. “Morning Sheila.”<br />
<br />
“Good morning Debbie. Anything new?” Sheila was now in control, Kyle wasn&#39;t sure if her consciousness was actually in her body, or whether it was the curse. <br />
<br />
“No, nothing new. Thank God for that eh?” Debbie replied.<br />
<br />
“No new is good news, I&#39;ll see you at lunch.” Sheila said walking down the hall into the open office.<br />
<br />
“And for you information, I am still in here, and I am not happy with us. But I can&#39;t hurt myself, so I will figure out how to punish my new body part later.” Sheila confirmed her continued existence to him, Kyle tried to say something. “No talking, your a body part right now, I&#39;ll let you talk at home, maybe.” Kyle teared up a little, Sheila took them into her new private office and shut the blinds. She then reached up and slapped him, pointing a finger right in his face. “You had to do it didn&#39;t you Sheila. You had to fuck around with that curse, what did you think, you&#39;d get away with it? You wouldn&#39;t get hurt? Well now I&#39;m carrying you as a burden. I&#39;m responsible for us now. Now stop crying like a little bitch and lets get to work.” She wiped the tears away with a forceful hand, then marched over to her desk and sat down. <br />
<br />
Kyle tried to contain himself, being forced to look in the direction that she wanted him to look. He felt extremely stupid and guilty for their current problem, he felt her rage, but an hour went by, his eyes forced to read through document after document, as the hour passed she finally cooled down a little. His mouth opened and she started talking.<br />
<br />
“Oh Sheila, and you know I&#39;m talking to you Sheila, but that&#39;s the curses work, you think your the only one who played with the curse?” She reached down and touched her own crotch, Kyle&#39;s eyes went wide. “Yeah, that&#39;s my cock, our cock. I played with the curse, but didn&#39;t get burned as bad as you. I&#39;m sorry Sheila, but you fucked up, and now we have to pay the price for it.” Kyle teared up. “Hey! No crying remember, your part of me.... us now. We are part of each other Sheila, and I know that you want me to call you something else, but you, the person who was you, don&#39;t exist anymore. It&#39;s just me, Sheila, and her extra body parts. I don&#39;t like it either, but that&#39;s the way we&#39;re forced to talk and be now. But I&#39;ll take care of us, and whatever we need. Now, relax Sheila, we still have seven hours of work, and I need you to work with me.” She hugged him, “Oh, my stupid little boy....” She paused, “Huh, I guess I can talk to me directly here and there.” There was silence for a moment. “Well, lets get back to work shall we boy?” Kyle didn&#39;t like being called boy, but it felt a little comforting that she was treating him as a separate person at the same time as a body part.<br />
<br />
As they worked Sheila cooled down a little more, she started interacting with him here and there and then held a folder in front of him. “Here, hold this boy, may as well work with me on that.” Kyle did what he was told, holding the folder, as the day continued she made him do more and more complex things, soon enough they worked as a fluid team. She had him hold papers up as she typed, keep their place in document until she need to look at them and generally worked with him as a second set of hands. During lunch she had him sit politely in her lap, her new massive size taking up the entire side of the small table, she made small talk with Debbie, gossiping about this and that, no one the wiser that anything was off. After lunch a few more hours of work and finally she made their way to the car. <br />
<br />
Sitting down in the somewhat cramped car, she wrapped her arms around his body. “Good job boy, Momma&#39;s proud.” She let go and turned on the car, “Let&#39;s go home, we&#39;ve had  a long day.” She drove them home, her mood still angry but better than this morning. Arriving home, Sheila walked them up to the apartment. “Now, when we get in here, don&#39;t start screaming. We&#39;re stuck like this, I&#39;ll take care of us, but I need you to stay calm, okay?” Kyle gave her a thumbs up. “I&#39;ll let you talk for a minute, and if I don&#39;t like it, I take control again alright?” Kyle gave another, slightly unsure thumbs up. She set foot in the door and took off their heels. Kyle gathered the courage to say something.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry M.... Sheila.” There was a long pause.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s okay boy, and I know you don&#39;t like being called that, but we share a brain, and it says we&#39;re Sheila Perkins, but we&#39;re also your former self boy. It&#39;ll have to do.” Sheila said.<br />
<br />
“How are we going to make this work?” The part of them that was Kyle said. There was another long pause, much longer than before. <br />
<br />
“We just have to, there&#39;s no going back. Now let&#39;s get a shower.” Sheila felt Kyle tense up. “Oh stop boy. We&#39;re going to be naked with ourselves eventually, so why now now, besides, we need to wash up, can&#39;t ignore hygiene just because your nervous boy.” Sheila walked them back to the bedroom to get started.</p>
