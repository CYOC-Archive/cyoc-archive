<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robbie was sitting in his room and sighing sadly. He was a terrible loser who had no friends or love interest..<br />
<br />
He was playing some kind of game on his phone, which he soon got tired of. After deleting the game, he decided to look on the Internet for something else interesting to download.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, an advertising window appeared that advertised some kind of application called Chroniwak. Out of curiosity, Robbie clicked on the advertising window.<br />
<br />
He was immediately transferred to the page of the Chronivac website, where it is written that the application is free and available for download. After reading the reviews, Robbie did not understand what this application does - is it just mounting photos?<br />
<br />
Still interested in the application, the teenager clicked on the download button. It didn&#39;t take up as much memory as Robbie thought.<br />
<br />
And when it downloaded, and Robbie launched the application, he saw a strange interface - a window where it says &quot;photo of the object&quot;, and at the bottom a text box with the classic instruction &quot;enter text in a line&quot;.<br />
<br />
A hint appeared next to the photo window, which said that he need to take a full-length photo and preferably without clothes.<br />
<br />
Deciding to try, Robbie took a full-length photo (in his underpants) and fixed it in the &quot;object photo&quot; window. He clicked on the text field and thought about it. Is this really a description? <br />
<br />
There was another hint in which it was written that you need to enter the required changes. Robbie, however, decided that it was something like a neural network that modifies the photo according to what is written in the line.<br />
<br />
He decided to write to make his hair dark and curly. As a result, Robbie saw that in the photo his straight blond hair had really become curly and brown in color. These changes looked as if he actually had such hair.<br />
<br />
The boy looked at it in surprise, scratched his head. Robbie decided to check out other, more serious changes. He texted:<br />
&quot;Black skin, purple underpants, 21 years old, athletic build, tattoo &quot;Sexy&quot; on the chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
When he finished, he saw that the photo really began to change - Robbie had a tattoo on his chest, his muscles became more massive, stubble appeared on his face. As a result, a pumped-up black guy in purple underpants with a tattoo on his chest appeared in place of a skinny white boy in the photo.<br />
<br />
Robbie was surprised by this - he had changed beyond recognition in the photo, so he also changed the way he imagined. Robie came up with an idea that made him blush, but still decided to write:<br />
<br />
&quot;Horse dick and balls&quot;<br />
<br />
In the photo, the guy really even had a groin changed - it was visible in his underpants. Robbie got a boner at the sight of this sexy guy.<br />
<br />
The boy looked at the photo with surprise and decided to save it. A green &quot;save changes&quot; button and a red &quot;cancel&quot; button appeared under the text field.<br />
<br />
He pressed the green button, a warning appeared:<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want to save the changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie pressed yes without hesitation. A blue circle appeared with a white check mark inside and the inscription: &quot;Successfully saved&quot;.<br />
<br />
Deciding to take a break, Robbie put his phone in his pocket and went to the toilet. Along the way, he felt something strange - as if everything around him had become smaller, but it turned out that it was the boy who had grown up.<br />
<br />
Then his skin seemed to catch fire and something seemed to dig into his chest. Robbie was afraid of this and, leaning against the wall, was breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
He squeezed his eyes shut, clenched his hands into fists and clenched his teeth to endure the pain. When suddenly everything passed - the body stopped burning, the chest no longer hurts.<br />
Exhaling with relief, the guy opened his eyes and hurried to the toilet. Running inside, he noticed other changes that had happened to him - he turned black!<br />
<br />
He stood in surprise and looked at himself. How... How? What?<br />
<br />
Robbie could feel the muscles pulling at his clothes. The sound of tearing fabric, and the guy was standing in his underpants, which were also stretched and threatened to tear from the changed penis and balls.<br />
<br />
His underpants also changed before his eyes - they turned from green to purple, and much larger. He was sweating all over from it and breathing heavily until the changes stopped.<br />
<br />
The boy first looked at himself, and then in the mirror - a black muscular guy with short dark hair and a tattoo inscription on his chest looked at him from the mirror. Robbie touched his face in bewilderment and made sure that it was really him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; Robbie said in a lower voice, &quot;how can it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
He could hear the front door open and close-his parents had come. The boy panicked because he didn&#39;t know what would happen to him. How will parents react to it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Robbie, we&#39;re here,&quot; his mom said, &quot;I brought heavy bags. Take them, please.<br />
<br />
- I ... yes, okay, - Robbie replied, until he realized that he had done something stupid - his voice is different now.<br />
<br />
But then suddenly his mother calmly said:<br />
<br />
- Hurry up, I bought your favorite ice cream.</p>
