<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are quite fond of anthros, as you see them all over the internet. You decide that you are definitely not wearing a female costume, so you <br />
open the door marked 'Male anthro' and what you see amazes you. Rows and rows of all different anthro dog costumes surround you as you walk <br />
forward. You look around, not knowing which one to pick. Finally, you see one that catches your eye, and you take the rack off the bar. It seems <br />
like a German Shepard, with dark brown fur and black tipped paws and ears. The front paws of the suit are more hand shaped, matching the <br />
anatomy of an anthro. You also noticed that the designer of the suit had cleverly added a member to the suit, to prevent any discomfort to the <br />
wearer. You loved it. You find your way back to the front of the store and ask for a changing room. &quot;Ah, found one, have you?&quot; asked the clerk as <br />
he showed you a cubicle. You went in and locked the door. &quot;Remember, you have to take off all clothing for best results.&quot; came the clerk's voice <br />
from outside.<br />
<br />
Firstly, you stripped completely, then you took the suit and unzipped the zipper at the back. The outside of the suit felt just like real dog fur, <br />
while the insides were made of rubber latex, and it felt strangely warm in your hands. Ignoring the strange warmth, you lifted your right foot <br />
from the cool linoleum floor and stepped into the right leg of the costume. A pleasuring feeling shot up your leg as the suit felt as if it was <br />
wrapping around your leg. You wiggled you toes just to get it out, and you were delighted to see the black padded paws of the suit move at your <br />
command. You pushed your foot even deeper into the costume, and you reached the bottom, where you felt a small leathery pad. You soon <br />
found out that you could expose and retract the retractible claws on the paw by pushing the pad. The claws themselves felt real as well, unlike <br />
the cheap plastic imitations on other costumes. You quickly insert your other foot into the other costume leg. Both of your legs are now very <br />
muscular looking, and you silently praise the expert use of padding by the costume designer. After standing up, you suddenly feel elevated, and <br />
you look down to see that the shape of the costume's paws were cleverly made to make you look digitigrade, balancing on the balls of your feet.<br />
<br />
Next, you continued pulling the costume up to your waist height. You shoved your penis away inside the penis of the costume, standing erect. <br />
You were pleased to see that the member of the suit had a sheath that neatly tucked away the penis. You could have sworn that you felt your own <br />
member grow longer to fit the costume, but you concluded that it was just over excitement. There was one annoying part to putting the costume <br />
fully on though, and that was the rear. You had to get the skin a great depth up your backside, causing some tickling feelings to go up your <br />
spine. The tail also got positioned appropriately just above your crack, and suddenly you felt your spine extend and join with the tail, causing <br />
you to flu forward in surprise. Just then you looked back at your feet, which looked like paws, and wiggled your toes. The clawed paw wiggled <br />
back and you reached out and felt the paw. You felt your hand touch your feet as if you weren't wearing the suit. In shock, you brush away some <br />
of the fur and you find out that instead of the fabric that was used to make the suit, there was actual dog skin. Your own skin. Somehow you felt <br />
that it was alright, and you accepted it, although it was a bit shocking at first.<br />
<br />
Getting back on with putting the costume on, you pull the thing up to your chest and slip your hands and arms into the armholes. You reach your <br />
fingers until they touch the end, feeling the rough leather padding on your palms. You experiment by exposing the claws on your paws, then <br />
retracting them again. Your fingers still retain their shape, except they had become a bit shorter. You grab the costume and slide it up to your <br />
neck, until all that is left is the head. You look at your reflection in the mirror on the wall, admiring your new fur, tail, muscular look and your <br />
giant pink cock. Finally, you grab the head with your clawed hands and close take a deep breath. Then, you slide the thing over your head, and <br />
felt the latex inside suddenly turn all gooey and sticky. The melted substance moved around your face, going into your eyes, ears, nose and <br />
mouth. You felt your ears sharpen and move to the top of head, while your nose got pushed out into a tight muzzle. Inside your mouth, you felt <br />
the liquid surging around as your tongue thickened a little and also lengthened. You licked your sharpening teeth as they progressed into fangs. <br />
You open your eyes and you immediately tell that your eyesight has been dramatically improved, as well as your sense of hearing and of course, <br />
smell. You look at yourself in the mirror, a full anthro German Shepard. You went back to the front of the store, where you met the smiling clerk. <br />
&quot;Oh, this suit you very well!&quot; he remarked. You nod in agreement. &quot;How much will it cost?&quot; you ask, and the clerk laughs and says it's free. <br />
&quot;Anyway, here's a few things. Firstly, you cannot take the costume off but you might have already noticed. Secondly, you will have all the features <br />
of a dog, still retaining some human traits like the ability to talk, of course. Also, it won't matter if you stay naked since you have all that fur. <br />
Lastly, being an anthro, you can choose to walk on your hind legs or on all fours, as both will work fine for you. Thanks for coming! Nice doing <br />
business with ya!&quot; he said and held out a hand. You held out your hand to shake it. &quot;Oh, remember the claws, please.&quot; said the clerk, and you <br />
both laughed.<br />
<br />
You walked out of the shop proudly, walking at a brisk pace. The cold wind didn't bother you at all, due to all the fur you had. Before returning <br />
home, however, you went to the huge park near home and put your stuff down. Then you got on all fours, and began running around at crazy <br />
speeds. You enjoyed the feeling of the wind in your fur, and you held out your tongue, sending small drips of saliva streaming from your mouth <br />
as you went. After a few minutes, you went home and went into the room you shared with Jack, and you realized that he wasn't home yet. You <br />
saw his wolf costume lying on his bed, and you went over. You laughed at the pathetic imitations of the claws as you extended yours and <br />
compared them. You could tell that it was going to be a great night.</p>
