<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jeff is trying to decide what to do, there is a noise coming from the living room area of the house. Unaware to Jeff, someone has just broken into the house through an open window, the person, who has his pistol in one hand and a big duffle bag in the other, is now quietly creeping up the stairs.<br />
<br />
The man seems to be searching for something specific, as he starts to search the upstairs rooms, when he approaches Jeff’s room, he halts when hearing noises coming from the room. ‘Darn it,’ the thief thinks to himself, ‘someone is here. I was hoping the whole family would be out, I got to get who ever it is under my control.’<br />
<br />
Jeff is so focused on trying to decide what to do, that he does not notice his door slowly open and a man all dressed in black with a black mask and black gloves enter his room.<br />
<br />
The thief aims his pistol at the boy and lets out a cough, Jeff turns around and his eyes widen in fear. Jeff opens his mouth, but before he is able to shout or say anything, he is cut off by the man, “don’t even think about it, kid,” the man says, his voice deep and demanding, “if you do as I say, then I will have no reason to hurt you or take you with me, understood?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “y-yes, sir,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Good,” the man says, “now, move away from that Laptop and hand me something which I can use to tie you up.”<br />
<br />
Jeff does as told, he moves away from his Laptop and walks towards his closet, all the while he feels the man following him with his gun, ‘fuck me,’ Jeff thinks to himself. The teen grabs a belt and turns around, holding it out to the man, “w-will this do?”<br />
<br />
The thief nods, “that’ll do nicely,” he says, “now, turn around and put your hands behind your back. Don’t think of doing something stupid,” he adds warningly.<br />
<br />
Jeff does as told, he turns around with his hands behind his back, he then feels the thief tie his hands tightly with the belt. The way the man ties him up so professionally makes Jeff assume, that this person must have done this type of thing pretty often. “What… what do you want? Who are y-you,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Who I am should not concern you,” the man says, “as for what I want: I am looking for a certain document, that contains some… classified information.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what do you mean,” Jeff asks, “s-something like… um… government secrets?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” the thief says, “now, do you have something I can use to blindfold you?”<br />
<br />
“Th-there should be a blindfold in my bed side table, in the top draw,” Jeff replies, “wh-why do you think th-that we would have c-classified documents? My parents don’t work for the government.”<br />
<br />
The thief walks over to the bed side table and soon finds the blindfold, all the time keeping his eyes and gun trained on Jeff. “It does not surprise me,” he says, walking back with the blindfold, “I doubt your dad would have ever told you about his real job.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what do you mean,” Jeff asks, “m-my dad works at an investment company.”<br />
<br />
“That is just a cover,” the thief says, “in reality, your dad is a secret agent working for a shadow agency.”<br />
<br />
“Say what,” Jeff asks, “a-are you sure you are not mistaking my family for someone else?”<br />
<br />
The thief smirks under his mask, “positive,” he says, “don’t you find it weird that your family had moved so much? Didn’t you find it suspicious, that each time you settled in to your new neighbourhood, that you suddenly needed to move again?”<br />
<br />
“I… I never gave it any thought, to be honest,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
The thief nods, “I understand,” he says, “as a kid and teenager, you would be more focused on video games instead of paying attention to what is happening around you.”<br />
<br />
“I… I guess,” Jeff mumbles, he looks up at the man in front of him, but before he can ask more, the man raises a hand and Jeff falls silent.<br />
<br />
“I can imagine that you have so many questions,” he says, “I don’t blame you. But I really don’t have much time, if you continue to obey me, I just might tell you more about your dad as we go along.” He puts the blindfold over Jeff’s eyes and grabs the boy’s shoulder, “move,” he then says and Jeff starts to walk, his mind swimming with questions.<br />
<br />
The thief leads Jeff through the house, through every room, until Jeff finds himself sitting on the couch in the living room. The thief has tied up Jeff’s legs, making it unable for Jeff to move at all, “finally,” Jeff hears the man say, “I knew I’d find them eventually, time to get out of here.”<br />
<br />
Jeff hears the man walking up to him, “s-so,” he says, “a-are you gonna free me?”<br />
<br />
There is a moment of silence, “sorry kid,” he says, “I am afraid I have to take you with me.”<br />
<br />
“What? Why,” Jeff asks, “why kidnap me if you have what you came for? Pl-please, I promise I’ll not say a word!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” the thief says, “I don’t need lose ends. You are coming with me, I’ll think of what to do with you once we are at my place.”<br />
<br />
Jeff feels the man, who seems to be pretty strong, but then again, Jeff is not really a heavy weight. He feels the man pull him to his feet and through him over the shoulder, as if he were a bag of potatoes.<br />
<br />
The thief carries Jeff down into the garage, which is connected to the house, and lies Jeff on the concrete floor. Jeff hears the man walk away but soon return, “open your mouth, boy,” he orders, Jeff does as told and feels the man shove something into his mouth and then taping it shut. Next thing Jeff notices is that the man seems to wrap him in a blanket and tie a rope around his body, then he hears the man walk away. The thief walks up to Jeff’s room, ‘I couldn’t help but notice, that this kid has the PC-Version of the Chronivac and that he already has scanned himself,’ he thinks to himself as he walks up to Jeff’s Laptop, ‘I guess, he was about to test it out on himself before I disturbed him.’ The man pulls out his phone, grinning under his face mask, ‘I’ll copy his file into my Chronivac-App and then delete his Chronivac. Having his file in the App will come in handy, I already have a few ideas what to do with my new toy. Hehe… he’ll never will see his family again and once I am done with him, he might not even want to see them again.’<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the garage, Jeff tries to wriggle himself free, but finds that he is unable to, ‘fuck,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘this guy really knows what he is doing. He is so skilled, he is defiantly not some punk who does this the first time.’ Jeff then hears a car pull up the driveway, soon after he hears the man return. He hears the garage doors open and soon feels himself being lifted up then dumped into the trunk of a car, soon he hears the engine roar to life and the car starting to move. ‘I wonder where he is taking me,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘I am scared, what is he going to do to me?’</p>
