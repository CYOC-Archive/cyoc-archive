<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, you&#39;re not allowed to have dogs in here!&quot; shouted Vice Principal Chalmers.<br />
<br />
Kurt turned his head to face the impudent school official, and smiled . <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you? You don&#39;t go to this school!&quot; Chalmers exclaimed as he.bore down on the Wolfman and the bitchboi quarterback who was now a golden retriever. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why this is my companion animal, and I am here to tour this school to see if it accommodates autistic students. Are you my tour guide?&quot; Kurt said as sincerely as he could. Chad thought Kurt was such a talented master: he could act, he could play football, he could make Chad into his faithful bitch (a tiny part of Chad didn&#39;t agree with the last part but that part was locked away in a deep dark corner of his now canine mind.<br />
<br />
Chalmers was visibly flustered. He hemmed and hawed.  Then he said, &quot;You are? Um. Nobody told me that you were here. I&#39;m not prepa- uh, shouldn&#39;t your service animal have a vest?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, a vest? Maybe? I normally don&#39;t go to places with other people, but Chad gives me the  confidence now to go where there are other people. That&#39;s why I thought I&#39;d visit this school. I can see it was - a mistake. I will leave now,&quot; Kurt said carefully enunciating each word like he was speaking to a small child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no. If you&#39;re here for a tour, you&#39;re getting a tour. I normally give the tours, but wasn&#39;t advised that you were coming today. Oh, Ms. Hansen is out for an emergency appendectomy.  I bet you scheduled with her. So sorry for mix-up. Now let&#39;s start with the library and then the athletic facilities...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that sounds perfect, uh, sir,&quot; Kurt replied. His wording flustered Chalmers who realized he hadn&#39;t introduced himself yet.<br />
<br />
Chad the dog stood obediently at her master&#39;s side. Mentally, Chad was horrified that he was naked on all fours in the middle of his school hallway, and the vice principal not only didn&#39;t recognize him, but took him for just a dog. Worse yet Kurt was manipulating him so that he could lead naked Chad around his own school passed his teachers and classmates and teammates. It would be so humiliating. <br />
<br />
The tour didn&#39;t take terribly long. But during the tour, Chad managed to get petted and fawned over by half the school cheerleaders, who had study hall in the library, and then by most of the football and swim teams who were changing when  Chalmers led Kurt and Chad through the locker room.<br />
<br />
Kurt thanked Chalmers for the tour saying he would consider the school, but still had others to tour. He never gave Chalmers his full name, not that Chalmers asked.<br />
<br />
Chad was unceremoniously loaded into an animal crate in the back of Kurt&#39;s SUV.  Kurt simply ordered, &quot;Stay, girl.&quot; Locked the rear door. Climbed in the SUV and drove off.<br />
<br />
He made a couple phone calls. The first went to voicemail. He left a message, &quot;Taking bitchboi to the vet. Mating went off without a hitch. Stupid vice-principal insisted on giving me a tour of the school. So behind schedule. But during tour Chad got pet by dozens of his schoolmates which I think did wonders to reinforce his new place in the world as my bitch dog. Catch you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second call was answered, &quot;Veterinary clinic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this is Kurt Wolfe. I had an appointment today for my dog, but we&#39;re running about an hour late. Can I still fit her in today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, we should be able to- I think if you can get here within 15 minutes. Later, we may need to reschedule?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I should be there in 10. Uh, could someone help me with the animal crate when I get there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Of course, Mr. Wolfe, see you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurt hung up. Laughed, and turned on his Playlist.<br />
<br />
Chad hadn&#39;t been into heavy metal, but with canine hearing the tunes blaring were downright painful.  How could Kurt stand the pain- he had lupine hearing, didn&#39;t he?<br />
<br />
Chad could see the Dairy Queen out the crate door across the street from where Master Kurt parked. That meant Kurt had taken Chad to his father the veterinarian&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Wolfe? I&#39;m Brad, you asked for someone to carry your animal crate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurt paused, the big muscular stud standing over him in a skintight white t-shirt, white jeans and white tennis shoes looked a lot like Chad. He wore a blue plastic name tag that reminded Kurt to call him Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brad, yes she&#39;s in the back here,&quot; Kurt said opening the rear door. <br />
<br />
Kurt had expected to help Brad carry the animal crate, but Brad pulled it out with Chad inside and hefted it up on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it, Mr. Wolfe,&quot; Brad said.&quot;The doctor will see you now. Your father made all the arrangements with my father- the vet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aha, Kurt thought, that explains the resemblance.  Brad must be Chad&#39;s brother.  Kurt almost said something about the resemblance, but thought better of it.<br />
<br />
Chad was soon naked on an exam table getting a preliminary exam from his brother. Chad remembered unhappily that summer a few years ago when his parents took a two month vacation leaving him in Brad&#39;s hands for two months. Brad had already decided he was going to study veterinary science and train dogs, and he figured he could practice his techniques on Chad at the isolated family cabin up in the mountains.  He kept Chad naked and kenneled with his new puppy Max behind the cabin. Max ended up thinking Chad was another dog, and Max wanted to dominate his would be master. Brad ended up keeping Max as his dog, and Chad got Bounder from the shelter instead. Chad tensed up as Brad palpitated her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine specimen, you&#39;ve got here. She&#39;s got good hips for breeding. Looks like she bred recently in fact. If that was unintended we can give her a DNC.&quot; Brad offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. She was bred with a stud. He was available, and I&#39;m afraid that was part of the delay getting here.&quot; Kurt was somewhat annoyed with Brad.</p>
