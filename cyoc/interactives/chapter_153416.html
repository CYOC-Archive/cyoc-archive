<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mom? Why are doing this to me?&quot; he asked, wide-eyed, sad, and worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, honey! I&#39;m not your mom! We&#39;re going to meet your new mother right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, you are my mom! And I&#39;m not an 8 year old boy with a twin brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently, you are now,&quot; she chuckled in reply. <br />
<br />
Kat finished putting his new booster seat into the van, and his mom tried steering him towards it. Suddenly, with a flash of anger mixed with fright and dread, he took off. He started running away in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freeze, young man!&quot; mom yelled out. He didn&#39;t get very far. Only a few steps. Suddenly, he couldn&#39;t move any more! Not even a single muscle! Not even the slightest facial tic. He was completely &quot;frozen&quot; in place in mid-stride. His right leg slightly raised and bent at the knee. His left foot firmly planted on the ground, and his skinny little arms beginning to pump. But not a single twitch he could make. He was totally stuck in place! <br />
<br />
His mom walked over to him to talk to him. Kneeling down to his new height of 3&#39;11 and pulling out the same mirror his sister had, she held it up to his face. Staring back at him, was the wide-eyed look of a stone statue of Jake&#39;s face staring back at him. The mirror then morphed, and showed his entire body from a normal grown adult&#39;s perspective. A statue of a young boy wearing stone clothes and stone Doc Marten shoes. A statue in mid stride like he was getting ready to run. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now. You&#39;re going to get into that van, or you&#39;ll suffer the consequences of remaining a boy statue. I can have you forever as a garden ornament you know. You and that stone fountain outback can keep eachother company forever. Though, you won&#39;t be up for much of any sort of conversation with it. I know you can hear me and see this image in the mirror,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Totally frozen in place, unable to budge even an inch. Seeing the statue of a young boy that looked nothing like him and the idea of forever remaining locked in place, he began to internally panic. Unable to express his horrified state of mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you understand me young man?&quot; she asked as if he would be able to answer her. He couldn&#39;t. His body was complete stone with his brain trapped inside and magically kept alive and well. His brain with no control over his stiff and hard body that encased his trapped mind. <br />
<br />
She then undid the freeze spell, and he went sprawling to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clumsy stupid boy,&quot; Kat said as she came walking back their way after getting the booster seat ready that Jacob would now ride in. Now meant for him instead of Jake.<br />
<br />
He pushed himself around so he could look all the way up to his former family from his prone position on the ground. He started to get up, ready to make another break for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so!&quot; Said his mom. Both of his legs and arms once again turned to solid stone. Both hands planted on the ground behind and underneath him. Left knee curled up under him with foot planted on the ground ready to spring into action. His right leg straight out. <br />
<br />
His mom kneeled once again, and said &quot;I can make your life a total living hell if you do not cooperate. And for this, I will erase all of your learning beyond second grade, and make even second grade school work difficult for you. I&#39;ll keep all your other memories intact, including your real identity in your mind as punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt the tingling in his head while he said &quot;wait! I&#39;ll be good!&quot; But the tingling went away, and he didn&#39;t feel any different than he did a few moment before. In reality, his mom already did what she threatened. She erased all of his education post second-grade. And to test it out, she asked him what 6*6 was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uuhh... 6 times 6? Its...uuhh...it&#39;s....&quot;<br />
<br />
....but his mind was drawing a blank. He wanted to use his fingers to try and figure it out, but unfortunately, they were frozen solid beneath him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s....I know what it is, but....I don&#39;t know what it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
With horror, he looked at his mom. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had to go ahead and do that to you eventually anyway. You MUST attend elementary school with your twin brother and not be a wiz kid. You wouldn&#39;t be any smarter than you are now, and by the time you&#39;re in high school, you would be at the same level as everyone else. Everyone will wonder why such an 8 year old wiz kid stopped progressing by the time you are 16. Again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Second grade!? I&#39;m going to be stuck as a second grader? You won&#39;t change me back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s up to your sister. But I think this is her way of getting rid of you. But for now, we gotta get you to your new home and convince your new family that your little Jake&#39;s little twin brother, Mike.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom released him again. Again, he fell to the ground. He quickly got back up, but his mom just as quickly grabbed him by the back of the neck so she could physically control him without resorting to magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow, ow, ow! Your hurting me! Stop!&quot; His mom inexorably directed him to walk to the van. He tried using his small little body to resist. But alas, his mom was now much larger and stronger than he was! And she had magic to make good on her promise of making his life a living hell, to boot!</p>
