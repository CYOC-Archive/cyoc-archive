<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy held Lina&#39;s hand as they reached the footpath painted on the floor. Amy made Lina wait at the start and then walked ahead to inspect the path. Curiously, the transition between steps very clearly ended in pawprints this time, rather than the familiar shape of her new hooves.<br />
<br />
Shrugging in wonder at the magic in this store, Amy walked back to Lina, holding the girl&#39;s sneakers and socks in one hand, and stabilizing her friend with the other. They began to walk down the path. Amy watched Lina&#39;s small feet intently as they walked.<br />
<br />
At first the changes were to small to see, it merely looked like she was settling her feet each time she stepped down. Then, her feet began to shift ever so slowly into the paws of a dog. Her toes began to crack and pop, her nails getting darker and pointier with each new step. Her arches stretched forward, thinning slightly as her feet grew longer.<br />
<br />
While her gait was now awkward, Lina kept going. Her big toes made louder pops and began to slide back up her feet, shrinking as they moved. Her remaining four toes plumped up, looking more doglike by the second. She paused momentarily after another couple steps, lifting a foot up to stare at the bottom. On the bottoms of her toes and the balls of her feet, thick dark pads had begun to form, giving her a bit of cushion as she walked.<br />
<br />
Soon enough they reached a pair of prints that looked even longer than before. Lina mumbled in pleasure as she stepped onto them and felt her feet stretch out another inch. Her balance felt off, and Amy reached out again to stabilize her as she swayed.<br />
<br />
Peering at the next set of prints, Lina saw that they no longer showed her heels touching the ground. She looked curiously at Amy, who merely smiled and motioned for her to continue walking. Lina lifted her heels off the floor, finding her balance better and her feet more comfortable as she did so. <br />
<br />
The last portion of the trail  was quickly going by, and Lina&#39;s feet stretched and warped one last time, changing to better support her new digitigrade stance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Amy?&quot; she asked quietly, becoming more and more aroused by what was happening to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeighhss?&quot; came Amy&#39;s horsey reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does this one know what to change us into? If you walked this same path and got a horse, how come I&#39;m getting a dog?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Amy said, shrugging her shoulders. &quot;Magic?&quot; The two girls shared a joking smile and laughed. <br />
<br />
Her toes puffed up a little bigger, and her dark, pointy claws finished forming. Blonde fur had started to blossom on her feet while big toes finished shrinking into dew claws. The fur rose up, stopping just above her ankles on her calves, where it fluffed out slightly more than on her paws, becoming more feathery.<br />
<br />
Standing at the end of the trail, not even needing Amy&#39;s help to balance anymore, Lina stood on fully formed dog&#39;s paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is heavenly.&quot; Said Amy with apparent relish. She smiled over at her mare friend, who smiled warmly back.<br />
<br />
When her legs and paws were finally transformed into those of a dog, Lina sat on a nearby bench to examine them, while Amy disappeared down an aisle. Lina poked the padding on one foot with her finger, then began rubbing her paws. She moaned quietly at the feeling, her feet felt so good now.<br />
<br />
Amy sat down next to her, pulling out a dog comb. She started to run it through Lina&#39;s hair. Lina sighed pleasantly, not realizing that as Amy did so, her hair was getting even thicker, longer and shaggier. When Amy began to comb her arm, however, Lina knew something was up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you--?&quot; she began to ask, but was interrupted by a gentle &quot;shh&quot; from Amy. Lina watched Amy&#39;s comb, saw the fur now growing on her arm with each successive stroke and gasped. Amy brushed a good coat of blonde fur onto her entire right arm, but continued combing on her forearm and up to the wrist until the fur there was long, vibrant and thick. She must have combed it out to two or three inches, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;The path gave you some long feathering on your hind-paws, so I had to match it,&quot; she explained sweetly. She combed up the other arm until the fur there was just as luxurious, then brushed her tail a bit to make it bushier. &quot;You&#39;re starting to look a whole lot beeightter!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Lina believed it, even if she hadn&#39;t checked a mirror yet. Amy playfully scratched her behind the ears and Lina giggled. &quot;But what about under here?&quot; she asked her friend, indicating her shirt.<br />
<br />
Amy shifted on one paw. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if you&#39;d let me, or if you wanted to do it yourself.&quot; She held out the comb, but Lina lifted a shaggy arm to decline it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be honored if you were the one to change me completely,&quot; she said. Amy smiled even wider than before as Lina slowly lifted off her shirt. Amy began with her shoulders, which had not been brushed because of the short sleeves. She did a good amount on them, allowing the fur to puff out in order to round them out. Then she slowly worked down her neck and upper chest. She paused when she got to the bra, giving an questioning look at Lina. Lina simply smiled and removed it, revealing to Lina her moderate endowments. Amy gave a lustful look at them before resuming her work. Ever so gently, she brushed golden fur across the breasts, careful to avoid the nipples, then continued to cover the rest of her front side.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Lina&#39;s entire body had been given a shiny coat of golden blond hair. Amy moved onto her face, brushing her cheeks and chin. Then she brushed a short coat of hair over her forehead, temples and nose. She squinted, examining Lina&#39;s furry face, then began applying the brush to her cheeks again. The fur grew a bit longer there, already giving the impression of a muzzle even when Lina didn&#39;t have one yet.<br />
<br />
When Amy was finally finished, she led Lina over to the mirrors to admire her work. Lina was enchanted, rubbing her fur and gleefully cooing. Then, she hugged Amy, pressing her two breasts against her six. Amy gave her a tight hug back, and Lina moved her face in for another kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh,&quot; Amy teased, pulling away. &quot;No more kissing until we can put a muzzle to a muzzle!&quot; She tossed her bra and shirt back to her, and Lina threw them back on over her thick fur as they continued onward to the next stage.</p>
