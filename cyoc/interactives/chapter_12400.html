<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike and Sei wandered through the hall near the stairs.  It was dark and damp, smelling of aged wood and mould.  It was still driving out, and the two needed somewhere to go. Mike was the oldest of the group at 19. He was a big guy, 6 feet tall with thick muscles, but he was covered in a soft layer of pudge which created a small gut on him. Weighing in at 220 pounds, he was no pushover. He had hazel eyes and a square jaw, making him look quite handsome. Sei was just a little younger than Mike, by around 3 months. He was 5'11&quot;, and a slender 140, he was also very mediterranian in appearance with dark hair and eyes.<br />
<br />
  A loud ticking noise echoed down the hall as the walked, and Mike pinpointed the room it was coming from. He opened the door into a room made out of an odd red coloured wood.  It was split into two halves.  One side of the room looked rotted and aged, the other very new.  Mike noticed two clocks in the room.  He walked to one, Sei to the other.  Mike stood in the fresher corner while Sei walked under the clock in the rotten section. Both were going by normally, but when Mike stood under his it started to move backwards. Mike spoke up. &quot;This clock is going backwards... fast.&quot; he said.  &quot;This is one crazy mansion.&quot;  Sei agreed &quot; this clock is going forward really fast.  I wonder why.&quot;.  Both were unaware of what was happening to them.  The 5 o'clock shadow on Mike's sqaure chin was lightening and retracting into him while Sei was sprouting some hairs on his own chin.  Mike noticed that his shirt was still really wet from the rain and pulled it off, wringing it out as he searched the room.  He tightened his grip on it and twisted, not noticing his biceps shrinking as he did so.<br />
<br />
  Sei was feeling itchy as he explored his half of the room.  He raised his hand to scratch his now more muscular chest.  He didn't even realize what was happening to himself.  He looked at the clock as it began to whirr faster and faster, three or four times as quick as when he had entered.  Sei was getting beefy, his pants tightening, his shirt riding up, his jawline becoming more squared.  He felt a cool breeze on his stomach and unintentionally placed his hand down on it, feeling a change.  His abs were somewhat soft, covered in a thin layer of fat.  He looked down over himself with a gasp.  His body inflated with muscles, he was huge, weighing 230 pounds.  His clothes were skin tight.  He looked over to see Mike, but was forced to look down.  He saw Mike, who had shrunk to 5'7&quot; in complete shock.  His muscle definition was gone, he had become plumper, his 5 o'clock shadow looking as if it had never happened.  Neither of them had realized it yet, but Mike had lost 5 years of age which had deposited itself on Sei.<br />
<br />
  Mike tried to run over to Sei, and as he did his pants fell revealing his whole body. He gasped as he looked down over his fat kid body.  His 7 inch pride shrunken to 4 and a half inches, the once ample hair around it in only a ring at the base.  He stepped out of the tent like pants and ran to Sei, finding he was stopped halfway.  Sei tried to move into Mike's side of the room but was stopped by some force halfway as well.  As Sei beefed up further, the button on his pants popped off.  His quads could be seen pulsing as his legs moved within the jeans.  His shirt was pulled tight, tearing down his lats.  &quot;What's happening to me!?&quot; Mike said in his more teen-like voice.  &quot;I don't know!&quot; Sei cried &quot;Look at me!  I'm getting older!  And you, you're turning back into a kid!&quot; Sei pointed down, Mike looked over himself as the last sprigs of hair retracted from his now 3 inch penis, his testicles started to shrink and pull up a little.  &quot;Oh no!&quot; Said Mike in a now more childlike voice.  He was 13 again, now standing at only 5'4&quot;.  <br />
<br />
 Sei's pants groaned as he tried to push through the barrier.  His body was starting to 'let go' as a small gut started growing on his midsection.  The thighs of the pants ripped, and he was still feeling constricted.  Sei took his strong arms down to the pants and tore them asunder, then did the same to his shirt.  His now 8 inch dick escaped, a thick patch of hair lead up to his navel in a trail.  He had definition a man could only dream of at his new age of 24, except for his abs.  Sei grunted against the force as he grew.  He was doing no good.  Sei looked around and saw the clock.  He reached for it, but was jus too short.  He jumped, and the room shook, but still no luck.  He got a chair and placed it under the clock and stood on it.  As he reached his hand for the clock, the chair groaned under his new weight. The rotten wood shattered under 250 pound Sei, dropping him to the floor.  <br />
<br />
  Mike, now shrinking to 5'2&quot; had left puberty.  His body was round, gathering baby fat on top of his existing weight.  His leg and armpit hair had entirely dissappeared along with that on his groin, and at the rate it was shrinking, it looked as though his dick would shrink as well.  He took a cue from Sei and got a chair under the clock. He took a pocket knife from the jeans in his hands and opened it.  With one swing he jammed it into the much lower clock.  It stopped the hands at 4.  Then, Mike felt a drop.  His height fell to 4'8&quot; as he turned into a 10 year old.  Sei groaned when his stomach swelled as he hit 27.  His muscles grew a little, creases formed under his eyes.  His hair color faded slightly.  He stood and shouted &quot;Why didn't it stop?!  You stopped the clocks!&quot;.  Mike climbed down off the chair as he shrank again to 4'5&quot;.  He was 8 now.  &quot;I don't know!&quot;  He said, rubbing his tiny body.  29 year old Sei was panicing.  &quot;What if this doesn't stop?  You're going to dissappear, and I'm going to die of old age!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Mike whimpered as he fell again to 3'9&quot;.  He was now only 6 years old.  Sei got a few more wrinkles, his stomach sagged a little, and definition dissappeared from his muscles.  Now 31, Sei was slamming the energy between him and his now much more youthful friend.  Mike cried out &quot;No!&quot; as he shrank a further 2 years.  The once 6 foot tall Mike was now only 3'4&quot;.  Sei aged a little more to 33.  His chest hair had thickened, his cock had lost some of it's youthful length... and it stopped.  Sei pushed his hand through the energy field and stood in front of the now tiny Mike.  He had gone from being a 6 foot, 220 pounds with a 7 inch dick to 3'4&quot;, an overwight 70 pounds, with a dick less than an inch long.  He was now only 4 years old.  Sei had gone in the opposite direction.  He came in 5'11&quot;, a thin 140, with a 18 year olds 6 inch dick.  He had aged to 33 years old though, his body had muscled up in his early 20's, but had let itself go after 25.  He had a huge beer belly, weighing in at 270 pounds.  His dick had passed it's prime, now extending to 4 inches.<br />
<br />
  Mike sat on the floor, rubbing his obese little body, trying not to cry.  How would they fix this?</p>
