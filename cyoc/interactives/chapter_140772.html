<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the streets of a remote town, two young women were walking home from school - of course, they were aware of this bear virus... But it seemed to mostly appear in larger cities, and not some out in nowhere town... Perhaps they were just gullible? Either way, they were just discussing the assignment they had to get done, when one of them sneezed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bless you.&quot; One of them said, a blonde-haired, tan-skinned girl named Bianca. She was of above average height for her age, and a little toned from playing soccer, but neither her hips of bust stood out.<br />
The other girl had no choice but to snort, before rubbing her cheeks with her hands. &quot;Ugh, it&#39;s getting cold...&quot; She mumbled in discontent. The other girl is Robin, a red-haired girl who keeps her rather long hair in a pair of ponytails. She, unlike her friend, is fairly busty. Both of them wore their school uniforms - white shirts with a beige vest and dark blue blazer, with a red skirt and tie. Additionally, they also wore a pair of above knee-length stockings and brown loafers.<br />
<br />
&quot;But right, anyway... So we gotta make a presentation about some kinda disease. Stuff like that makes me squeamish, so we&#39;re not doing anything too gross.&quot; Bianca insisted, leading to Robin thinking for a moment before looking over to her friend.<br />
&quot;Oh, maybe that, uh...virus that&#39;s been all over the news...? Um, the really strange one that scientists can&#39;t even explain...?&quot; Robin suggest. Bianca gives a hesitant shrug in return.<br />
&quot;...The bear-thing, or whatever it&#39;s called? That almost freaks me out as much as meat-eating viruses... No way.&quot; Bianca quickly declines before she stops walking, putting two fingers on her forehead as she attempts to come up with anything else... But Robin doesn&#39;t immediately notice her friend stopping, and continues to walk for a little more, before sneezing again. She sighs, and uses her hand to wipe under her nose...<br />
...only to feel it brushing against hair? She could feel hair growing on her upper lip - and it was getting thicker every second! She was about to alarm her friend, when she let out a gasp, groping her belly as her uniform gets tighter around her stomach. She can see and feel the fabric swell out, and her belly&#39;s getting soft, pushing against her groping hands, and continuing to swell at an alarming rate. It didn&#39;t take long for her to realize what was happening... She was infected?!<br />
She tried to speak, but her throat felt...off - really off. And even worse, her uncomfortable attire just got worse as she noticed herself getting taller, eventually letting her growing belly flap free. Robin&#39;s breathing was getting quicker, and she swore she heard some of her shirt&#39;s buttons giving up under the pressure. She was looking around - this was already terrible, but she was in public, too... She didn&#39;t want to be seen while this happened - it was so embarrassing ,she&#39;d rather die! ...But as she did so, her usually long ponytails flapped around, and...grew shorter as well. Her hair was rapidly shortening, the hair bands she used to hold them up falling off as she was left with a short, kind of messy hairstyle, which connected with her growing facial hair. ...Bianca was also nowhere to be seen... She was pretty easily spooked, so seeing this transformation must have scared her away...<br />
<br />
Her bra suddenly tore, and her breast looked like they were getting bigger for a moment. ...But those weren&#39;t boobs anymore, but moobs... Large, floppy man boobs, their round shapes gone... The girl was basically a giant now, surely over 8 feet, and still not slowing down. Her tights were already ripping around her fattening legs, which were quickly getting covered in hair, which was also happening to her belly and chest. She felt so heavy...she had to sit down, despite how cold the ground was - she&#39;d just have to endure that... Her arms followed her legs, fattening up and getting covered in hairs.<br />
More clothes were getting torn, such as her shirt&#39;s sleeves, and the vest, making it hang loosely on her much bigger frame. Additionally, the remaining shirt buttons also popped off, leaving her man boobs uncovered - she tried to cover them but with little success. Her skirt was also ripped at this point, and her panties were stretched to the limit between her large, fatty hips and hairy ass... And then something else. A moan forced its way out of her as an insane amount of pleasure built up in her crotch - she knew something like this would happen...but it was still overwhelming! Mercilessly tearing her panties off, a large dick rapidly grew, already erect as it got lodge against her belly. The feeling of it pushing and throbbing against her fat and body hair...it turned her on so badly.<br />
Balls soon followed, which were coated in a thick layer of pubic hair, leaving the once young lady with an over one foot long cock.<br />
...At this point, the pleasure was too overwhelming, he started trying to jack off, no longer caring about what was happening, or who may be watching. ...He even ignored how his face was twisting and changing. His cheeks puffed out, and his nose bloated up in size. The structure of his face became a lot more masculine in general, completed with thick, bushy eyebrows.<br />
<br />
At this point, the large man sitting there was almost unrecognizable, only his red hair color and torn-up uniform remaining... But he wasn&#39;t satisfied, his hands weren&#39;t enough... He needed someone to help him with his needs.</p>
