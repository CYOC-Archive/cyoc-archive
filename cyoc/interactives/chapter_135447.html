<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Comfortable with Martha and William being okay with Eric going with her, Julie made her way back up to the second floor of the Anderson home to retrieve her phone so that she could get in touch with her own mother. It took her away from being able to listen in on Eric&#39;s conversation with his parents, but if it meant that she&#39;d get to spend more time with Eric, the better. She did privately recognize some of the issues that Eric had had that morning, and remembered some of the things Eric had told her about how growing up in Minnesota had been like for him. Between kids that bullied him for not being solely interested in one thing and the stresses that had been there in his parents&#39; relationship with each other, she knew that Eric had been somewhat isolated growing up. She&#39;d even seen a bit of that when they&#39;d first met as Eric had been a bit shy and nervous when it came to anything related to Moon Lake&#39;s were secret and that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
And like Eric&#39;s parents, Julie didn&#39;t want to see Eric slide back into the quiet and nervous boy that she&#39;d first met. It had been hard enough just to get him to really open up to her at lunch at school the first time around, Julie didn&#39;t want to lose the happy and even confident young weremer that Eric had become. For Eric had made HER happy just as she made him happy, and she didn&#39;t want to lose that. And that was her real reason for inviting Eric along, as she was fairly certain that much of her father&#39;s invitation had been intended for just her and her mother, but the misunderstanding with Arthur had created something that seemed to hurt Eric and Julie wanted to make it up to him. And at the same time, she didn&#39;t think it&#39;d be too much of a problem as she figured that her parents liked Eric too. After all, her mother had also been in on the plan that gave her the chance to turn Eric, and Eric had even walked all the way to City Hall to ask her father some questions, which she guessed her father answered satisfactorily for him. With all of that, she felt fairly certain they&#39;d be okay with having Eric along.<br />
<br />
She quickly found her phone, still sitting on Eric&#39;s bed next to her backpack and she picked it up and began scrolling through the numbers that were in her cellphone&#39;s memory. She could make out Nate and Alex as they did their homework while she looked for a familiar number and then clicked on it. The response was the image of a ringing phone appearing on the screen and staying there. It didn&#39;t last very long, and as Julie raised the phone so that she could better talk into it, a familiar voice answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Julie,&quot; came Martin Stovall&#39;s voice came over the phone, &quot;how&#39;s your homework coming along?&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave a bit of a blink, as she actually expected to hear her mother&#39;s voice, but she supposed that if her dad had planned to go out for dinner, he might have left City Hall a bit earlier than he normally did. And in the end, it really didn&#39;t matter as her purpose was to make sure it would be okay if Eric came along with them, to make him happy and feel assured that Eric was the most important man in her life, as he would be her future.<br />
<br />
&quot;It actually wasn&#39;t too hard today,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;no big group things... and Eric and I were able to get through all of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;Did your mother tell you about our dinner plans for tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Julie answered with a nod, &quot;She did...&quot;<br />
<br />
She was about to continue, but her dad actually cut her off as he began to explain some of the travel arrangements. She let him continue, as it would be something she&#39;d need to relay to Eric once everything else was handled before they left. She didn&#39;t think that the plan was to go anything that would require formal wear. It might be something a bit outside the usual, but nothing that would require something super special. But it still made sense to be prepared and aware on what the time table was. After all, she didn&#39;t want to gain permission and then find that they&#39;d been left behind because they missed the pickup or weren&#39;t aware on where to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... it won&#39;t be too long before your mother and I will come by the Anderson home to pick you up and we&#39;ll head out,&quot; Martin spoke, &quot;you won&#39;t need anything fancy... but there will be some travel time involved... as I&#39;d figured it&#39;d be to do something a bit beyond the Local Diner and what&#39;s in Moon Lake. Something that would be a nice treat for your mother... and of course something we&#39;d share with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great dad,&quot; Julie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll see you soon,&quot; Martin spoke and was about to hang up when Julie managed to get a full word in that served to get him to recognize why she&#39;d called in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad... before you go, I gotta ask  you something,&quot; Julie spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, what&#39;s up?&quot; Martin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could Eric come with us?&quot; Julie asked, &quot;I mean... he is part of our pod and all... and I... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You offered an invitation to him?&quot; Martin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie admitted, &quot;don&#39;t you like him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like him just fine, dear,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;I just hadn&#39;t expected that that would be the question you ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, dad...&quot; Julie pleaded, &quot;He&#39;s practically family already... as he and I will be together forever and we&#39;re both happy for you and mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie heard hear father chuckle before he answered her, &quot;Okay... hold on, let me ask your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie then waited quietly while still holding her phone as she looked around the room. She knew Eric&#39;s room fairly well, as this was hardly the first time she&#39;d seen it, but she couldn&#39;t help but feel her heart flutter as she took in his scent. It fueled her happy hopes for the proverbial happy ever after that just about every weremer felt, particularly after finding someone who glowed with a bright light that told that weremer the person they saw was their one true love. That was the essential felling she had with Eric, and everything they did was in line with those sorts of hopes. <br />
<br />
She wanted him to feel happy and welcome and know that he was loved and that the decisions that were there were whole heartedly for romantic love. Certain things that were more &quot;adult&quot; in nature was there too, and there were times when even Julie felt surprised at how eager she found herself at times to be with Eric. But then, there was still a lot of the romantic thoughts that were also there, and generally speaking Julie accepted it for that reason. She loved Eric and knew that he was the &quot;one,&quot; and it was with that weremer specific confidence in that happy future that she&#39;d met with  And she simply went through some quiet daydreaming as she waited for her father to finish talking with her mother. Eventually her father&#39;s voice was heard over the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother&#39;s okay with it, dear,&quot; Martin spoke, &quot;Just make sure that he&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie pumped her fists with glee and answered, &quot;We&#39;ll be ready, dad. We&#39;ll see you and mom soon! Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that she hung up and began collecting the things that would go in her backpack. It didn&#39;t take too long, and she soon set about going back downstairs where she found Eric with his parents in the kitchen and everyone looked good.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents said they were okay with Eric coming with us,&quot; Julie announced as she came back in and could help but smile when Eric smiled in response, &quot;they&#39;ll be by in a moment to pick up for the evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric happily smiled and came forward to hug Julie while William and Martha simply nodded with the acceptance that that the Stovalls were okay with Eric going along with them.</p>
