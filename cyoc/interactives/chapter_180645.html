<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Chaz&#39;s alarm went off around 6am, he was surprised to see that Mara was already out of bed, her unmistakable silhouette missing. He pulled himself out of bed feeling pretty groggy and headed over to the kitchen in his underwear where an interesting new sight came into view. He could see Mara in the living room on her workout bike, hair tied in a messy bun, looking a bit more energetic and happy today. &quot;Good morning cute stuff!&quot; Mara gleefully called to him. She looked a little thinner in the face and really all over the place. She was still a little lumpy but an obvious difference was apparent. &quot;I guess you were right! I checked myself on the scale today, would you believe I lost 20lbs over night!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great babe! I&#39;m glad to hear it!&quot; Chaz cheered. A success! She was loosing weight finally, and look how happy she is! Mara paused the bike and got off of it. Her but and her hips were looking a tad bigger too, and her hair a little less greasy. As she approached him Chaz noticed something else. Was she taller? Her head looked as though it was coming up to his nose now. He didn&#39;t remember programing that but it must be a side effect perhaps...<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so energetic too! I don&#39;t know why I got so down on myself, thanks a bundle babe, you always have my back!&quot; She beamed at him and came in for a kiss. Upon further inspection her lips were fuller too, they felt much nicer on his own lips than before. &quot;Now, maybe you can squeeze in some time this morning?&quot; She wispered in his ear as her stubby little hands grazed his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I uh... Sorry not today baby at least, not yet, I can&#39;t be late I have some important information I need to pass on to my professors. But maybe later?&quot; He was a but flustered. There appeared to be more going on than just the weight loss and the upgrade to her hair and skin, other traits appeared to be pushing through as well. Infact come to think of it, her eyes were looking lighter in color, almost a hazel now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, you&#39;re no fun, well maybe later then big guy.&quot; She winked at him and walked off into the other room to continue her work out. Mara wasn&#39;t usually so forward or horny either, Chaz usually had to do everything just right in order for her to get in the mood but wow, this was quite a change. He would need to write this down as soon as possibe.<br />
<br />
After jotting down some quick notes and running through breakfast Chaz headed to the school for his internship. He started to debate whether he should present his findings yet or wait until he had observed Mara&#39;s change a bit more. Initially he had thought that he nailed it but now it seemed there was other changes leaking in somehow. It didn&#39;t seem dangerous but he needed to work out the kinks and get to the bottom of this so that he had really good data to bring to the table. He brought the other samples of Mara&#39;s new solution to the lab on campus and kept his nose to the grindstone until it was time to leave. He had hardly spoken to a soul all day until his colleague and best friend Josh approached him as he was gathering his things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Chaz wait up brother!&quot; Josh was a bit more fit than Chaz, although he wasn&#39;t totally buff he definitely had definition, and at 6ft he was the perfect height. He also had clear skin, deep blue crystal eyes, a total looker in many respects. He was everything that Chaz was not but still a good guy and still into the same nerdy shit. &quot;Any new leads on your research?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe but I want to wait and see the results, I have one last experiment and if it all goes right, then I&#39;ll be ready to present.&quot; Chaz tried not to look at him, he couldn&#39;t let anyone know excatly what he was up to or else he&#39;d loose his ace in the hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to compare notes over some beers?&quot; Josh smiled devilishly, his pearly whites living up to the name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry but this stuff is kinda time sensitive, Ill see you tomorrow in class though!&quot; Chaz booked it to his car and drove home, hoping to see what would happen next. By the time he had arrived home Mara had just finished cooking dinner. It was steak which was also pretty out of character, she really wasn&#39;t much of a cook but damn was it good.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like?&quot; Mara mused with a twinkle in her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like? I love it, wow babe this is delicious, I never knew you could cook steak so good!&quot; Chaz praised, wiping juices from his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t either but everything just seemed to click this time around. I don&#39;t know I just feel, different today ya know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re just as incredible as you always are as far as I can tell, but you&#39;ve definitely lost weight love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww you&#39;re so sweet, now... put down the steak knife, and fuck my brains out my little scientist.&quot; Mara&#39;s breath brushed along Chucks face in a wave of intoxicating energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot; he spoke meakly. She waddled him along to the bedroom and began working her magic. Much to Chaz&#39;s surprise she took his dick in her mouth and gave him the best blowjob of his life. He had never came from a blowjob before but it only took a few minutes this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh darn, you normally last longer than that.&quot; She seemed a little disappointed &quot;oh well, just means Im getting better huh cutie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say, holy shit...&quot; Chaz was already dead, out of breath and mesmerized by the prowess by which Mara had made him cum. &quot;Oh um let me finish you off!&quot; Much to the discouragement of both sides, and no matter how hard Chaz tried, he couldn&#39;t seem to make Mara cum. Normally she was pretty easy but nothing tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what, you did great but I don&#39;t think its happening tonight babe so let&#39;s just head to bed.&quot; Mara consoled him, hiding her own dissatisfaction the best she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;You go on without me, Ive got some work I need to do.&quot; Chaz headed down to the basement again for the night and prepared for the next dosage of Mara&#39;s new genome. By the time she fell asleep he came to the bedroom once again and injected her once more, passing out afterwards from exhaustion.</p>
