<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about you take another dose and fuck me silly?&quot; Kelly said in a flippant, baby-doll like tone - egging Dillon on, &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to feel a man growing while he&#39;s fucking me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dillon for his part barely noted the contradiction between her earlier statements on him not being allowed to drink more than one dose, and her now telling him she wanted a third dose in him while he fucked her. After all, right now she had driven him up the literal fucking wall. She&#39;d excited him beyond all reasonable ability for him to pull himself back and examine this critically - Dillon had more or less ended up in the same spot as his athletic adversaries from school, and he barely recognized it. &quot;Sure thing, babe. You just uh, go get me one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back, big boy. Don&#39;t jerk yourself off too much.&quot; She said teasingly and with a wave as she got herself dressed again and exited the room. She knew what she was doing.<br />
<br />
There was no other explanation for how she was waving her butt back and forth as she walked, coquettishly dragging her finger through her mouth and then flicking at Dillon. A wink, and out she went. She was deliberately driving up his arousal further. Seeing if he could handle himself without making a mess without her there.<br />
<br />
A sweaty Dillon stood up and looked down at his rock hard, powerfully aroused cock. &quot;Fuck...fuck my cock&#39;s hard...&quot; He felt bleary and like his head was clouded with arousal. He never knew that being this ripped came with such a powerful libido. Was this why the jocks at school were always so eager to have some sex with their girlfriends - or boyfriends in the case of the gay ones? Yeah, yeah it probably was, Dillon told himself as he wiped off his forehead.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never done that thing she did toward the end with him before. His dick in her mouth, and her fingers in his ass... why did he never think to do something like that before? Dillon slowly got up and started to regard himself in the many mirrors lining the walls. Watching himself stand and the subtle dance of his muscles as he tensed them upon standing straight.<br />
<br />
Fuck.<br />
<br />
As amazing as he looked on his first dose, his second made him a full on mass monster of a bodybuilder. Dillon looked at his thick thighs, crowded around his bulging cock and throbbing balls, and found himself tapping his abs and running his finger next over his obliques, which finely accentuated the damn near eight pack that outlined his midsection. Every striation seemed honed - and the size was just out of this world.<br />
<br />
And that made him almost quiver as he wondered how much bigger a third dose might make him. &quot;Fuck, a third dose...might as well make me a champion. Bigger than Hans by far. That&#39;s almost scary to contemplate...and really, really fucking hot.&quot; Dillon ruminated outloud as he looked down at himself. Huh. He never knew his cock to let out so much precum, but he figured that he was just outstandingly aroused at this point and so, he did not really think much of it.<br />
<br />
Nor did he think much of how prominent his pecs were, and the way it seemed his nipples correspondingly looked prominent. Though he figured that was just the way his physique was shaping up. Touching one of those rippling pecs made Dillon outright gasp for air and fight back another quiver of arousal. He could not afford to make a fool of himself. &quot;Mmf...not cumming all over the place is more difficult than she made it sound...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dillon for now rocked back and forth on his feet. Focusing on - or at least attempting to - on the things he and Carmen once enjoyed together as friends before the transformations today. Focus on the nerdy stuff and not on the way he had become so fucking jacked--- A flex in his calves as he curled his toes, the impulse to just let it rip and try and get it back up before she got back was...overpowering. But Dillon was eager to please, as would many boys if they were so suddenly empowered. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want the hot woman he could so suddenly feel like he was in the leagues of to just dismiss him as---as some <i>quickshot</i>!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh Dillon~!&quot; Finally. Fucking finally. There was her voice, as she opened up the door again. Carrying as she walked in a little container of Muscle Tech X in one hand - and the unisex purple tank top and shorts that they were handing out earlier with the other hand. <br />
<br />
Hearing the &quot;energy drink&quot; swishing around in the little container made Dillon let out a breathy little moan. And Kelly could hear it, and she teased him, &quot;You&#39;re excited for your next dose? I think you&#39;re the first guy in here to get to three doses. Maybe we should be a little cautious from hereon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Dillon said as he crossed his arms in front of his massive chest, &quot;I mean, this stuff just makes me more ripped. Don&#39;t you want a REALLY jacked lover, babe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly paused for a moment, cleared her throat before seeming to collect her thoughts, &quot;We just don&#39;t know what too many doses might do. Keep in mind what it did for your body. What happens if it does something untoward with your heart? Or other musculo-skeletal systems?&quot; Dillon was not too far gone to not know what those were any more, far from it, and in fact the idea made him slightly sober up from the high of this macho arousal...<br />
<br />
&quot;So let&#39;s just enjoy this third dose and go with caution from there.&quot; Kelly stated, handing him the dose as she started to undress again. Not even bothering to lock the door - though Dillon hardly even noticed that little detail.<br />
<br />
As she handed the dosage to Dillon, he grinned as he handled it in his now powerful hand. To think, something as small and unassuming as this held the key to making him into a legendarily built, muscular man. Could this perhaps push him past even the notions of fitness of mere mortals, and into the realm of the Demigods of Myth? The idea of becoming some sort of muscular, Hercules-esque figure further excited Dillon... <br />
<br />
...even as he didn&#39;t exactly think of the lessons on <i>hubris</i> so often intertwined with such figures.<br />
<br />
He gulped the dosage down, and as he did, Kelly was on him, kissing and rubbing his body as the two of them once again intertwined in sexual bliss. &quot;Ohh Dillon, those hands of yours...so SKILLED!&quot; Kelly murmured as she felt one of his hands rubbing at her clit, the other cupping her generous ass, before the two of them started moving up against the walls. Despite being paired with such a behemoth, Kelly was not exactly helpless physically herself - she was athletic and lean to be sure.<br />
<br />
And so she back and forth led Dillon into thrusting into her, riding him and then letting him thrust into her, pressing against a wall as they went. Kelly was so distracted by the pleasure she wantonly indulged in she almost missed the start of the changes. As she felt Dillon&#39;s chest, she was pleased by him letting out a loud groan as his already powerfully built chest surged with growth yet more - almost challenging her own chest for space taken up on the body. And Kelly knew the signs well enough to know this was indeed the last dose if Dillon was wise about this at all. His nipples plumped up more, and even as his chest remained powerfully built, there was a slight amount of give to it.<br />
<br />
The nipples and general look almost gave the impression, if one was up and on him like Kelly was, of some sign of breasts just as much as chest development. Yet even as Dillon experienced such contradictorily masculine and feminine changes  in the midst of their sexual frenzy, a few more hints started to show amidst the growth: his head hair, as he guided Kelly on to the floor to begin thrusting away, was growing a bit longer.<br />
<br />
As he happily flexed his biceps amidst the thrusts and Kelly&#39;s moans, she could still see that his jawline was clear of hair, and his lips looked thicker. A bit more kissable in a feminine sort of way. As he thrust away and his back grew wider, Dillon&#39;s ass grew larger too - with a bit of a wobble to it as well. His hips seemed slightly wider - influencing his presentation a bit. As Kelly kissed him, she lightly bit his lip, making Dillon growl and thrust harder. &quot;Ooh, you&#39;re a naughty one babe---!&quot; Dillon uttered as he kept thrusting.<br />
<br />
While his girth was still appreciable, Kelly could also tell that Dillon&#39;s manhood was about half an inch smaller than usual. She said nothing about that of course. She wanted to keep him going, not mortify him into retreat. She luxuriated as Dillon&#39;s shoulders widened a bit more, arms pushing past the point of twenty inches into twenty two, almost superhumanly powerful as far as she was concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...ah, Babe, ohhh...I&#39;m gonna cum soon...&quot; Dillon grunted as he kept on thrusting.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-Go ahead, big boy...&quot; Kelly whispered in his ear, &quot;I&#39;m---ooohh, I&#39;m on the pill.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Dillon did not need to be told any more than that. She helped him get even further in than normal by locking her legs around that broad, powerful back and buttocks. Pushing him on, further, making him have nowhere to go but forward. &quot;Ahhhh, babe, here comes, here comes!! I&#39;m gonna...fuuuuuuck this is good!&quot; Yes, it seemed that part of this phase of his change was that Dillon got to experience one of the best parts of femininity - a full body orgasm, rippling through him.<br />
<br />
By coincidence both Kelly and Dillon both experienced their orgasm within moments of each other. She slightly after he - with him thrusting a few more times before pushing his hands into the floor and almost screaming with arousal - and it was done. Kelly could feel the emission from that intensely aroused, reddened cock as Dillon gasped and tried to suck in air as he coped with his surprisingly powerful orgasm that rippled through that massive physique.<br />
<br />
Kelly soon enough joined him in erotic bliss - feeling him shooting off so intensely pushed her along into an orgasm that had her screaming with joy, eyes shut, enjoying the moment as she knew that this would be the last &quot;change fuck&quot; Dillon could give her without giving away the game as it were.<br />
<br />
After a moment to enjoy the afterglow, Dillon started to get up and said, &quot;Whew...wow, wow, believe it or not, that was my uh, my first---&quot; He cleared his throat briefly, not even noticing that his voice was slightly oh so slightly higher rather than lower, &quot;First time. Yeah. That was my first time having sex at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, really...&quot; Kelly just lay there for a moment as she looked at the beefed up Dillon, gratifying herself even further by the various little signs of femininity mixed in with all the abundant masculinity. And chances were...Dillon would not even notice that things had changed for him to such a degree...! Ah, but that almost gave her another orgasm, it was such a sweet feeling knowing she held their progression and further changes literally in the palm of her hands. <br />
<br />
Literally, given the very slight dose amount contained in her nail polish.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were amazing for a first timer...&quot; Kelly said as she got up, starting to get dressed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you ever wanna have another time with me, I&#39;m always available. I think---I think after all of this, I&#39;m gonna be around the gym more,&quot; Dillon grinned as he started picking up the unisex clothes. As much as he had grown, these were still roomy on him, and fit comfortably. In fact as Dillon dressed himself, he had to admit that it was weirdly comfortable in another way. The fabric seemed really soft, and his skin seemed much more receptive now to such a thing. Made him just want to rub himself more!<br />
<br />
But he did just get done having some sexual fun. So he figured he might need a bit to let his body&#39;s refractory period go by. He couldn&#39;t very well just expect her to fuck the day away with him...right? <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind, big man,&quot; Kelly responded as she started toward the door, &quot;You gonna workout a bit more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I gotta test out my new physique!&quot; Dillon cockily stepped forward and joined her at the door. <br />
<br />
As the two of them left the private room, with the new clothes involved there would be little sign anything happened there. Though a suspicious looking Hans walked by and noticed how newly rippling Dillon looked, among other things, and found himself curiously deciding to look into Dillon as the day went by. He liked to consider himself the only man for Kelly, but now seeing Dillon all freshly muscled up to such an extraordinary degree?<br />
<br />
It beggared belief - and it asked too many questions about what just happened. <br />
<br />
Carmen as well found himself looking at Dillon as the powerfully muscled young man returned to the floor to begin another workout. Carmen had found himself a suitable bit of exercise with some leg work, and he barely even noticed he was looking a good deal thinner so far - with a bit more definition in some places - as he examined Dillon upon the young man&#39;s return. Curioser and curioser. Dillon had been big before, but now he was massive. And there of course was Kelly Crauss. Looking like she just got done doing something she really enjoyed. Those two disappear together, and they come back looking like this...<br />
<br />
Did something happen up there between them? Carmen asked himself as he looked around. <i>Dillon you lucky dog...</i> Carmen thought to himself as he leaned against a wall, feeling a tight sensation in his quads and glutes from all the exercise. <i>Still. Something looks kinda weird about him. I can&#39;t really place it. Maybe I should go and talk to him about it.</i></p>
