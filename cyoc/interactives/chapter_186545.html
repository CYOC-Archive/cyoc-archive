<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt stared blankly at the computer screen as he stroked his cock. He was unsure of what it had on the screen but he could read a pop-up saying: Chronivac Locked Until End Of Transformation: 2 Days Remaining. “What the hell’s a chroonivac?” Matt said aloud before becoming disinterested. Matt got up from his chair and attempted to turn the computer off but it took him a few minutes to remember how to. Since Matt never really used his computer, he never bothered learning how to use it.<br />
<br />
Matt then heard a notification sound emit from his phone. He walked to his dresser to see his phone had received a message from his best friend, Dylan. Apparently, it seemed the both of them and their friends had agreed to meet downtown for the night. “Great! I hope Dylan fucks me afterward” Matt said as he responded to the text in a simple abbreviation. As far as Matt was concerned, the more simple the better, especially since it didn’t hurt his head too much when he tried to process his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Matt walked to his closet and chose clothes that could show off his body without leading him to be arrested. If it was up to Matt, he would just love to walk around in nothing but boxer shorts or even more revealing underwear. But his friends had always warned him and since they clearly knew more than him he decided to follow their advice. Matt chose a white tank top and some tight chino shorts that showed off his nice bubble butt.<br />
<br />
Although Matt didn’t have to do much to seduce other men, he just loved wearing revealing clothing just for the attention his body got from strangers. Matt decided to keep the thong on to surprise Dylan later and quickly put on his clothes before donning a pair of white sandals. Matt chose to have Dylan pick him up while waiting for him posed in the mirror. “Damn. Wonder if I have time for a quickie?” Matt said spotting a rainbow colored didlo on his shelves. However, the car honks from outside alerted him of Dylan’s arrival. “Dylan better make it up to me later” Matt thought as he left his apartment.<br />
<br />
Dylan was waiting outside in a blue convertible. It was easy to recognize Dylan from his appearance as well. Dylan was a large man standing at 6’ 6” with a muscular build, and extremely hairy. Unlike Matt, Dylan didn’t like to shave which meant that Dylan face was covered by a beard and his arms and legs were coated in layers of hair. However, Matt didn’t really mind it too much, since Dylan’s 12 inch cock always captured his attention the most. “What took you so long? Too busy jerking off?” Dylan asked him as he entered the passenger seat.<br />
<br />
“Nah. I was just about to though.” Matt answered honestly as Dylan simply reversed and began driving. “So are James and Nick already waiting for us?” Matt asked him as he checked his appearance in the rear view mirror. “Yeah. They said they’ll meet us at the bar. Also could you try not flirting with every guy you see tonight. It’s so awkward every time we leave the bar and they all try to follow you”. Dylan said in a slightly annoyed tone.<br />
<br />
“Sure. Just fuck me tonight and I promise I won’t” Matt said happily. Although he was disappointed he wouldn’t be able to flirt with the other men at the bar, he was happy he could still stuff his ass with a nice cock. “Fine. But just try to control yourself you fucking himbo slut” Dylan replied as he pulled into the parking lot. The two of them got out of the convertible and walked into the bar.<br />
<br />
As soon as Matt entered he could feel all the eyes shift at him. Matt had already had sex with most of the regulars but he could see a few new faces appearing in the audience. Mostly people knew Matt around town as a manslut who let anyone down his pants in fact Matt was proud of his reputation. Matt walked over to a booth where Nick and James were waiting. “Did you two stop to fuck before arriving?” Nick joked however he was also being half-serious. <br />
<br />
“Nope. Dylan promised to fuck me tonight though.” Matt said as Dylan simply shook his head. After a few rounds, Matt and Dylan bid farewell to their friends and went home. “Damn. You probably shouldn’t have drank so much, we don’t need you being any dumber than you already are” Dylan joked as he drove them to Matt’s apartment. Matt originally would have been insulted by the joke and even more embarrassed from his prior actions and clothing but the new Matt simply laughed with Dylan as he led him to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t you get spit roasted yesterday?” Dylan asked him as he began to stripped off his clothing. “Sure did!” Matt said as he struggled to take his tight tank top off. “Here let me undress you” Dylan said as he took off Matt’s shirt before unbuckling his chino shorts and pulling them down to reveal Matt’s thong.<br />
<br />
“You leave this on for me?” Dylan asked as his cock started to become erect. Matt nodded and Dylan quickly grabbed the lube off Matt’s shelf and lathered his dick with it. “If only weren’t so godamn hot” Dylan said before mounting his cock to Matt’s ass. Although intoxicated, Matt still knew what to do as he lifted his legs and let Dylan pound him. Dylans long cock filled Matt easily and with incredible pleasure. Matt moaned as Dylan continued to fuck him until they both cummed a few times.<br />
<br />
As Matt laid on his bed with Dylan he could only think about one thing. Who he was going to have sex with tomorrow.</p>
