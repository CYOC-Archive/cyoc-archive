<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to go home and leave the park. You find yourself back in familiar surroundings. You make a mental note as to the location of the park and head home. You're beginning to enjoy this body but know that you'll have to switch back to your old body. After all, you still have classes to attend and no one would believe that you were in college.<br />
<br />
You get home and let yourself in. It's a pretty clean place considering that two guys live here. Your roommate owns the house and let's you stay here without paying rent. The only conditions are that you pay for half of the utilities, shop for groceries, and cook. You don't mind doing these things if it means basically free room and board.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you hear your roommate ask &quot;Is that you Mike!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
'Shit!' you think. 'Dale is home early. He's suppose to be gone for a couple more days with Pamela. What am I going to tell him?'<br />
<br />
You see Dale come down the hall. When he sees you he says &quot;Oh! Hello there. My name's Dale. What's your's?&quot;<br />
<br />
You figure that you'll have a bit of fun with Dale first so you say &quot;My name's Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Megan&quot; Dale said. &quot;I was wondering how you got in. I had the door locked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike gave me a key&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That fool!&quot; Dale said. &quot;I told him never to give a key to someone without telling me first!&quot;<br />
<br />
You figured that this has gone on long enough now so you say &quot;Take it easy Dale. I didn't give a key to anybody. I am Mike.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me but you don't look anything like Mike&quot; Dale said. &quot;You're too short for one and you're a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is me Dale&quot; you said. &quot;I found this shop that sells costumes that are guaranteed to fit perfectly. They are hung on magic hangers. When you take them off the hangers you're changed so the costume fits. I literally fell into this one. I slipped on a bag and when I reached out I accidentally took this school girl outfit off the hanger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's really hard to believe&quot; Dale said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can prove it&quot; you said. &quot;You were suppose to be away for a couple more days with Pamela.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what?&quot; Dale asked. &quot;Anybody could have found that out. You'll have to do better than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will&quot; you say as you take out the wig and place it on your head. Immediately you feel your scalp tingling and after a few seconds it stops.<br />
<br />
Dale had been staring at you in surprise. When you take off the wig he said &quot;That's impossible! How did you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's magic&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn't prove that you're Mike&quot; Dale said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can change back&quot; you said. &quot;Give me a few seconds.&quot; You take out your clothes, the hanger, and plastic bag. You put your socks and boxers in the bag, pin it to your shorts, and hang them and your shirt on the hanger. &quot;Before I change I need to get out of these clothes. I'll be too big to fit in them when I'm back to my old self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I usually don't mind naked girls in my house&quot; Dale said. &quot;However, someone may walk past and see you naked with me looking at you. You look to be about sixteen. I could go to jail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well close the shades then&quot; you said. You and Dale quickly close the shades and make sure that no one passing by would be able to casually look in. You also lock the door. After that you take off your school girl clothes. You're standing in front of Dale naked and feeling a bit embarrassed. You're about ready to take your clothes off the hanger when you hear a key being inserted into the lock. Before you can do anything the door opens and Pamela walks in.<br />
<br />
Pamela looks at you and then at Dale with an angry look on her face. She then says &quot;I knew it! I knew you were seeing another girl! And a high school girl at that! What do you have to say for yourself!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already told you that I'm not seeing another girl&quot; Dale said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what is she doing here!?!&quot; Pamela said. &quot;She's standing there naked and you're telling me that you're not seeing her! How stupid do you think I am!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you calm down I can explain Pamela&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't wait to hear your explanation&quot; Pamela said her voice dripping with sarcasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's best if I show you too&quot; you said then took your clothes off the hanger. You feel that static shock again and your transformation begins. The first thing to happen is your pussy seals up and your dick emerges. Your breasts deflate and your hips narrow. You feel like your being inflated as you grow. You look at your hands to see your fingernails shorten and your hands become thicker. Finally you're standing there back to your old self. You look at Dale and said &quot;See Dale. I told you that I was Mike.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you completely&quot; Dale said.<br />
<br />
Pamela stood there with a surprised look on her face. Finally she started to ask &quot;How... how... how...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I transform?&quot; you supplied. When Pamela nodded you said &quot;I found a costume shop that sells costumes that are guaranteed to fit. The magic is actually in the hangers. When clothes are hung on them and then taken off your transformed so the clothes fit. The clothes act as a template.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where can we find this shop?&quot; Dale asked. &quot;I'd like to get a costume or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can take you there&quot; you said. &quot;But first I want to change back into a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want to do that?&quot; Dale asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well after I accidentally became a girl I decided that I wanted to go around for the day as a girl&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to get a little insight to women Mike?&quot; Pamela asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you said. &quot;I just wanted to try something different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I want to go to this shop too&quot; Pamela said. &quot;I want to get a costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of costume are you going to get?&quot; Dale asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll decide when I see what they have&quot; Pamela said.<br />
<br />
While you guys were talking you had switched your clothes with the school girl clothes. You place them on the hanger and then immediately take them back off. You feel the static charge again and transform. Soon you were a high school girl again.<br />
<br />
Before you put the clothes on Pamela asks &quot;Can I see those clothes? I want to see what size you are. If you're going to go around as a girl at times you'll need more clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn't thought about that&quot; you admitted as you hand Pamela the clothes. While she was looking at them you put on the wig again so you could have waist length red hair again.<br />
<br />
Pamela finished looking at your school girl clothes and handed them back to you. When she did she said &quot;We'll need to stop and get you some new clothes and shoes. We should also get you a purse and makeup. I'll help you put on your makeup until you can do it yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Pamela&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, what do I call you?&quot; Pamela asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm using Megan when I'm a girl&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then Megan&quot; Pamela said. &quot;Are you ready to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
You had just finished buckling your shoes and said &quot;Yep. I'm ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
You, Pamela, and Dale leave and head to the costume shop.</p>
