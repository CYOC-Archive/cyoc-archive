<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Desert Foxes: The enemy of my enemy...<br />
<br />
Alexandra did the unthinkable to accomplish her master's wish, she left her side. She had <br />
to, it was the only way, 'I hate to do this master, I truly do, but if this is what you desire, <br />
then I shall precisely as you ask.'  Truth of things were, Alexandra was relieved, and <br />
actually a little happy that Tamthis was apparently a usurper. However, at the same time, <br />
she felt, regret? Tammie had seemed like such a nice kitesune, she and her friend. And if <br />
her 'second body' opposed Tamthis, this meant that Tamthis' second body was their alley, <br />
Janice wasn't it?  <br />
<br />
Alexandra had never seen any part of T's battle with Karther, and had been in no position <br />
to be told anything about it, or learn anything of it. So, from the servant girl's point of <br />
view, there was no reason that might not be able to trust Janice as well. After all, Tamthis <br />
had said undoubtedly that her second body and the djinn were allies against their city. <br />
<br />
Alexandra started as she looked this way and that to make sure no one was looking her <br />
way. 'Our city. Master Karther can't possibly mean... to let the djinn destroy it and steal <br />
away more of our people would he? No, no! That's silly! That would be insane.' Indeed, <br />
Alexandra had a rather ideal image of her master. <br />
<br />
Triple checking to make sure no one was watching her, including the statues, Alexandra <br />
said a couple words in arabic, she walked -through- the floor as if it was water and <br />
vanished from sight with no traces of having been there.  Of course the words had been <br />
arabic, languages likes english were only strange tongues that she heard in her dreams. <br />
<br />
She found everything as her master had said it would be (of course), the squarish tunnel <br />
leading in a straight direction west, the torches lighting and extinguishing as she past. <br />
True, Alexandra hadn't been told -how- to find the djinn army, but she had faith in her <br />
master, and figured they would find her. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tamthis came into the house sized bed chamber she (he as she shifted species and <br />
gender she came into the room) shared with Karther, the illusion of Alexandra mere stood <br />
aside, not having been given complex programming both due to Karther's lack of power <br />
and it being a quick fix to keep Jennifer from noticing the two conspirators' discussion. <br />
<br />
The furniture couldn't have been more impressive, the mattress and sheet more soft, <br />
everything right out of an Arabian fairy tale. Karther would have found the state of things <br />
to his liking if not for his own current state. <br />
<br />
&quot;My love,&quot; Said Tamthis kindly to Karther, &quot;I had forgotten to help you relax again after <br />
you imparted you knowledge of our new enemies upon us, I apologize for this my love, I <br />
hope you can forgive me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karther was supposed to be prince of smoothing his tongue, saying just what to say while <br />
thinking the complete opposite. But the hate he had felt for any being in the past was now <br />
a grain of sand in the desert of loathing he felt towards Tamthis right now. <br />
<br />
One of his creations, his -property-, had risen above him, and had -dared- take away his <br />
authority and effectively switch places with him! Absurd! Absurd! He was Karther! Prince <br />
among the desert foxes! King now technically! (Even if the way as which would leave him <br />
with murderous rage for all of his life). This was his kingdom! His domain! It had belonged <br />
to his kind long before humans had started migrating out of Africa like some disease. And <br />
now one of those humans he had turned into his plaything, had the gall to make him into <br />
his play thing. The fact Tamthis was ultimately still but following Karther's programming <br />
to it's local conclusion in harmonic response to her previous brainwashing was lost utterly <br />
on the kitesune king.  And finally, hearing Tamthis -apologize- for forgetting to make <br />
him catatonic again... Karther's ego had had enough, and finally snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU!&quot; Karther snarled, not caring how pathetic it sounded coming out of a vixen's mouth, <br />
&quot;YOU'VE STOLEN EVERYTHING FROM ME! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU IN A WAY I NEVER <br />
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO HATE ONE CREATED OUT OF AN INFERIOR BEING LIKE <br />
YOU WERE! You've stripped me of my power, my authority, my dignity! And you dare <br />
apologize for forgetting to steal away my wits again?! I -pray- the djinn scatter your spirit <br />
to the four winds and beyond!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tamthis was stone silent during Karther's rank, finally the great wolfen male asked <br />
quietly, &quot;So, you are not happy my king?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm NOT HAPPY you idiotic-&quot; Karther realized that he just doomed himself mere <br />
second after utterly those words. Tamthis' shadow fell over him, as the giant wolfen nine <br />
tailed wolfen loomed over his much smaller vixen frame. &quot;No, no, no, I didn't mean it like <br />
that-! You are-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I have failed you my master.&quot; Tamthis said in a depressed tone, &quot;I had hoped I had <br />
succeeded in bringing you happiness as is my one purpose as your queen... now you <br />
reveal to me that I was in error. I shall correct this at once.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, get away from you -wolf-, get away, get away-&quot; Karther inch away from <br />
Tamthis on the emperor sized bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, please hold our distraught king in place for one moment, just a moment.&quot; <br />
Karther was completely caught off guard when four of the six Shiva vixen's arms closed <br />
around her wrists and hoisted her up. &quot;Long have I been confused about many, many <br />
things my love, some things did not seem right, others did not seem quite wrong, but I <br />
realize precisely what must be done to give you the happiness you desire, deserve, and <br />
have earned my king.&quot; Tamthis said without a trace of sarcasm or irony. <br />
<br />
Karther had never been on the recieving end until recently, but he knew precisely what <br />
was coming. Fear and anger clashed and mixed like a maelstrom in his soul. &quot;NO! DON'T <br />
YOU DARE! I COMMAND YOU NOT TO! I COMMAND YOU!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just as you told me that I did not mean those words... in my dreams... I know realize <br />
here... in reality... that you also do not mean those words... it is my duty to bring you <br />
ultimate happiness, and now I realize WHEN I experienced ultimate happiness, and that <br />
was when I served you utterly and completely, as you carried the heavy mantle of <br />
leadership by yourself and only yourself... now I see what needs to be done to fulfill my <br />
reason for existence.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;LET ME GO! LET ME GO! DAMN YOU ALL I COMMAND YOU LET ME GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She will in a moment, but first look into my eyes my king.&quot; The wolf kelt down to be eye <br />
level with him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go to Hell!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;LOOK UNTO MY EYES GORGEOUS!&quot; <br />
<br />
Hearing the unfamiliar adverb used to address him was all it took to get Karther's <br />
attention, and that one look into the wolf titan's eyes, was all it took. <br />
<br />
As Karther had once done with Tammie, Tamthis now did with Karther, gentle stroking her <br />
fur, her figure becoming a visual feminine ideal, with no trace of ever having been male, <br />
her face followed suit, not only her gender, but her very identity being washed away, it <br />
was no longer a female version of Karther, but a completely different vixen staring into <br />
Tamthis' eyes. <br />
<br />
Karther felt it all leaving him, like sand running through his forepaws, all his hate and fear, <br />
flushed into the sewer system and out into the ocean. All his masculine thoughts falling <br />
into a bottomless black pit along with his desire to rule, replaced totally by a desire to <br />
serve and only know pleasure and only please. <br />
<br />
&quot;You do not fear me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not fear you my love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are free of the mantle and burden of leadership.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am free of the heavy weights of kingship my dearest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know only pleasure, you seek only pleasure, I give you pleasure. You know the joy of <br />
serving, the happiness, the glee to be of use to another, you do not mind, you can not <br />
mind, it is all you are, and all you have been and all you shall be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I seek only to know the constant pleasure of being you my lord, it brings me total bliss. It <br />
is what I am, who I am, what was before doesn't matter and thus never occurred.&quot; She <br />
spoke in a dreamy, peaceful voice, in a moment, the tiny flame inside her that was Karther <br />
flickered out and died. <br />
<br />
&quot;I alone need bear the heavy weight of leadership of this king, you, may know nothing but <br />
peace and happiness forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not envy such a heavy burden my lord, I am glade to be but your love.&quot; The vixen <br />
said in total honesty. <br />
<br />
Jennifer released the vixen, who crawled on all fours up to her master and stopped up, <br />
running her hands against his muscular chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel Kathy?&quot; Tamthis asked the vixen. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel happy mi'lord.&quot; She vixen said smiling up at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I have accomplished my duty.&quot;  Even in the frenzy of preparing with the war with the <br />
djinn, the vixens and wolvens through out the kingdom, all took a moment of pride <br />
hearing upon how their king had ascended to a state of perfect happiness, and Tamthis <br />
how now assume the heavy load stone of leading them to victory in the coming war <br />
him/herself. <br />
<br />
With Karther no longer, the illusion he had cast of Alexandra vanished, catching the <br />
attention of Tamthis. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kathy... where is Alexandra?&quot; Tamthis asked calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Kathy responded honestly, now lacking the self motivation to tell her <br />
master about the magic cave though she had no intention of lying about it or Alexandra if <br />
the questions came up. <br />
<br />
Not thinking Karther would have ever been able to commit any act of deceit upon Tamthis, <br />
the wolfen shifted to her vixen form for a moment (much to Kathy's dislike), and she <br />
began to shift slowly through the senses of her people. 'There? No. There? No. There? No!' <br />
Where could she be? For several minutes Tamthis was silent as he went through the <br />
senses of all his people until finally. &quot;Alexandra is missing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy scratched the back of her head, &quot;Naw, she went outside the city, bet that's why you <br />
can't see her.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tamthi yelled, &quot;What?! No! Foolish girl! Doesn't she realize the genies?!  They will find her <br />
and steal her away from us as they had done with the family I sent out in the name of <br />
peace! LUCY!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mi'Lady?&quot; The faux angel of sand appeared in the bed chamber. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra is outside the city!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; Those solid black orbs widened in dismay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Go! Quickly! Find her and retrieve her at once! Then we shall help her into the new <br />
state of our people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mi'lady!&quot; Lucy vanished in a mass of sand. <br />
<br />
Kathy giggled, she couldn't wait until Alexandra was just like her! <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
And Alexandra neared the exit to the long, long LONG tunnel away from the city that was <br />
her home, she felt a moment of pain in her chest. She wondered if she was dying. But the <br />
pain past a moment later. She looked at herself, and saw nothing different, and felt <br />
nothing different... except... she almost felt like.... something was missing now. She shook <br />
her head, her master had given her a task that was more important than any he had ever <br />
given her, or given any of his vixens, she would not fail him. <br />
<br />
Finally, she reached the end of the tunnel and walked up the steps, the torches going dark <br />
as she departed. To the outside observer, it looked like the sand was put water and she <br />
stepped out of the sands, not a grain of the material on her. <br />
<br />
She looked upon the endless desert, looking the same in all directions, she chose to keep <br />
going the direction the tunnel had been going and marched, just hoping the genies <br />
noticed her before she died of dehydration... or froze to death. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Commander Jasim!&quot; abu Haj, &quot;Our scouts have sensed one of the foxes, alone, in the <br />
desert again! This one just appeared in the middle of planes nowhere near the city! It <br />
appears to be alone! What are thy instructions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BAW!&quot; Jasim spat, &quot;Karther takes me to be a fool! That fox is nothing more than a trap! <br />
Ignore it! If we are lucky then T and his band of violations of tradition will fall for it, and <br />
learn the price of their impulsiveness! IGNORE IT!&quot; <br />
<br />
abu Haj bowed, &quot;As you command sir, it is not to no longer be thought about.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
An hour later, Alexandra was beginning to feel the chill, she was a desert kitesune of <br />
course, a fennec, but the cold seemed to get worse and worse as she marched, wondering <br />
where the genies were that had so quickly snatched up her innocent fellows. She dreaded <br />
dying alone in this desert beyond the only home she remembered, the thought of failing <br />
her master so utterly was unthinkable. <br />
<br />
'Just need to make it... to dawn.' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
Tabra never knew how not to take a jab, &quot;Technically, you, we, don't -have- a type <br />
anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you!&quot; Tabra heard her, their voice laugh, &quot;Will you not spoil my moment of <br />
awesomeness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's got you there!&quot; The two kitesune in the room both fell on their sides and belly <br />
laughed too, their tails waving everywhere... causing some sand to change color and some <br />
flowers to pop up, Tabra was glade this place was Tamthis' senses proof.  &quot;That was a riot <br />
on her part!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay! I need to work on my sense of humor!&quot; Tabra consented. 'For what time we <br />
have left.' <br />
<br />
She heard her voice say, &quot;It's not gonna go away is it?&quot; 'And I said don't ruin the moment.'<br />
<br />
'Seems like we can't really hide anything from each other now. I guess I just haven't had <br />
much to laugh about lately.' <br />
<br />
'You were the one who said we needed to open that door.'<br />
<br />
'Yes, I did.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you mind letting us in on the discussion?&quot; One of the kitesune asked, apparently <br />
Keiko and Akira thought it amusing to repeatedly play switch-a-roo making it hard to tell <br />
which kitesune was which. <br />
<br />
 Then the angel vixen started. 'What is this... feeling?' Janice thought. 'It feels... familiar... <br />
we're sensing someone whose close to one of us... I don't recognize it... it must be you... <br />
who is it? Whose face pops into your head with this feel? Don't think about it, just let it <br />
come like you would any memory...'<br />
<br />
The image that popped up was of a vixen in harem clothing with a slight smirk to her calm <br />
demeanor. &quot;Alexandra!&quot; Their body exclaimed.<br />
<br />
The two kitesune asked at the same time, &quot;What about her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's close.&quot; Tabra/Janice said, &quot;Well, close enough to trip our senses...I wired this place <br />
to be proof against a kitesune's senses so that's why the two of you can't feel it. But what <br />
is she doing out here? The kitesune city is nowhere near here. She's all alone... it... she's <br />
not doing so good... We have to help her... This could be a trap... I don't care, she's my, <br />
she helped me and Tammie, this is my chance to help her...if that is your choice....&quot; The <br />
angel vixen looked at the two kitesune, &quot;If we don't come back, tell Julio to 'get started' on <br />
the other angels, he'll know what I mean.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha!&quot; Said the one that had to be Akira. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful.&quot; The one that had to be Keiko added. <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra teleported out. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Commander Jasim, our scouts report that the Nazarene had come to the Judas Lamb. And <br />
there is a -powerful- entity coming from the kitesune city, shall we capture it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As I knew that idiot would. No, let the Nazarene get a hard lesson about what his heroic <br />
cost him. Intervene only after he is within a hair's breath of dying. And make sure to break <br />
the slaves' enchantments -before- bringing them here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As you command.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra!&quot; The vixen heard her name spoken from behind, she turned around, she saw a <br />
vixen in silvery reflective armor, form fitting but hard and practical all the same. She had <br />
wings, and was floating a dozen yards above the sand (Janice/Tabra had no intention of <br />
being near the sand if this was a trap after all). <br />
<br />
Alexandra looked at the vixen's features, so familiar, so important, who was it? Wait, it <br />
had to be, &quot;Janice? Janice is that you? What are you doing here? Why do you look like that? <br />
The queen had gone mad! I am sure of it now! The master sent me to speak with the genie <br />
army's leader, and only their leader. Please you have to bring me to them! Master Karther's <br />
is depending on me! He has no one else!&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra thought, this didn't feel like the kind of trap Karther would set, and Tamthis <br />
would have sprung the trap the moment Janice/Tabra showed her face. Still... <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember when you were Tammia's watered down clone for a short time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And....I felt it was an honor for the short time it was, because it was to serve my master <br />
in a way I never allowed to before... I was SPECIAL to him I thought...but... but the queen <br />
has completely lost her mind! She has betrayed the master! She treats him like a pet rather <br />
than working -with- him..&quot; Alexandra stunned herself with what she just said, &quot;Why.... <br />
didn't I see it like that before?&quot; She asked herself sounding honestly confused. <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra now knew something wasn't right, but whatever it was, it was looking less <br />
and less like a booby trap. <br />
<br />
Alexandra shook her head, &quot;Please! You must bring me to the leader of the genie army! It <br />
is VERY important I speak with him! I have words for him by the master.&quot; This wasn't a <br />
djinn, this was Janice, a vixen like her, one of Karther's people... but... all that chaos... with <br />
the harem seemingly going mad... all those wolves before the castle was absorbed... <br />
Alexandra was totally and utterly confused as she suddenly held her head. The only thing <br />
holding it all together was that sacred command from Karther, the only important order he <br />
had ever given her! She wouldn't betray his trust after finally gaining it.... not having a <br />
single clue, that she was the only entity in creation to have EVER been given his trust. <br />
&quot;Please... Janice... whatever you done... whatever you've become... PLEASE... for the sake of <br />
our master, help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra was no warrior, she had never been a warrior, if Janice chose to cut her down <br />
she'd have no defense, and the possibly last hope for her master would be gone. <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra lowered themselves a few yards close to the ground, &quot;Take you to the genie <br />
army commander, is that you really want?&quot; <br />
<br />
Alexandra nodded her head vigorously, &quot;Yes!&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra sensed it, or rather her, but, the feeling they got... was so mangled... <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra!&quot; Riding the desert winds, Lucy having sensed Alexandra at last doubled timed <br />
it (and wondering how she just appeared like that but not senses any power source strong <br />
enough to any of the djinn). &quot;Alexandra! There you are! What are you doing here?! King <br />
Tamthis and Lady Kathy are worried sick about you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Her voice was carried over the desert winds even before her arrival. Then the winds carried <br />
her to the spot where she sensed her fellow vixen, and saw who was with her. Her first <br />
reaction was. <br />
<br />
&quot;You found King Tamthis' secondary body! Oh Alexandra you clever girl! You've done <br />
wonderful! The King and lady shall be so pleased!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Alexandra whispered shaking her head slowly. <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra, stared in shock and dread at what they -knew- had to be Lucy... but at the <br />
same time, look so spiritually unnatural. The freed slaves had given a description of Lucy, <br />
but it was another to see it in person. <br />
<br />
Her sand colored fur and feathers, those eyes as black as oblivion, and the diamond where <br />
her navel once was.... Janice/Tabra thought of her sisters. Yes, Lucy somewhat looked the <br />
part but, her expression, the movement of her muscles, her tone of voice, all seemed, off. <br />
And what Janice/Tabra saw with her spiritual sight, was ugly. It was like someone had <br />
taken her spirit and treated it like a patchwork doll!  Janice/Tabra felt a wave of discomfort <br />
flow through her being close to her. Janice/Tabra felt ashamed at feeling this way about <br />
one of her sisters but, at the same time she couldn't help it. Her first thought was to just <br />
grab Alexandra and RUN. <br />
<br />
'If we grab Alexandra and teleport now would Lucy be able to follow us? I don't know, but <br />
if we take Alexandra with us without first looking for a 'wire' or 'bugs' as cops would say, <br />
we'll be inviting the enemy through the front door. She's being honest. I know she is, but <br />
she could have been tagged without her knowledge, and we'd need to focus all our senses <br />
for that.... and we can't risk that with.... her here.'<br />
<br />
Still smiling (she never stopped it seemed) Lucy let the desert winds lower her near <br />
Alexandra, holding out her hand, &quot;Now come along spare body and Alexandra, you must <br />
meet with King Tamthis personally, he's promised to fix both of your of all your problems. <br />
You'll never have any confusing or conflicting thoughts again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra was paralyzed. Scared of what to do, and scared of what NOT to do. <br />
&quot;N-no.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your king commands it, you can not 'say no.' &quot; Lucy said as if kindly correcting a child on <br />
a minor detail. <br />
<br />
A bullet flew between the two, Lucy pulled her arms back as Alexandra took a step back. <br />
Janice/Tabra reloaded the expended chamber in the revolver, &quot;You know, I've found I just <br />
never could trust automatics.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bullets and guns are cowards' weapons!&quot; Lucy snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans once said the exact same thing about the long bow.&quot; Janice/Tabra said dryly. <br />
'Can we just close enough to her to use cross to cure her? You can see her spirit, it's hasn't <br />
just been altered by yours and the rest of your sisters were at first, it's been totally <br />
violated! It'll take more than just a moment of contact to cure her, and she's not likely to <br />
let us keep it in contact with her that long. We're going to have to do this the hard way.'<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to go up there!&quot; Luna shouted, she felt it, they all felt it by now, Lucy, the feeling <br />
they had of her was horribly mangled but it was Lucy... and they felt Janice/Tabra was with <br />
her too, and they knew it would be to a tea party.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on!&quot; Julio said waving his hands, &quot;I know 'T' is kinda reckless at times but <br />
seriously I don't think you going out there will help much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you can take us all on again?&quot; Luna said to him intensely. <br />
<br />
Julio returned matter of fact, &quot;Two thousand plus years experience beats untrained power <br />
says I can.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Granted,&quot; Vicki said, &quot;But do you really expect us to just sit here? isn't this why we all <br />
made this choice in the first place? To -save- Lucy and Natalie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio answered, &quot;And you'll get your chance! But if you all go rushing out there, not only <br />
will you tip off the enemy about you four, but you'll going in even more half-cocked than <br />
you'll already be!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Erica asked raising an eye brow. <br />
<br />
Julio almost kicked himself but said, &quot;Another Angel showed up yesterday, name's Jasim, <br />
and he brought along an ARMY of what you call genies to take down the kitesunes... but <br />
genies .... they aren't known for their mercy... and this Jasim guy isn't that nice a guy to <br />
people he doesn't deem 'worthy.' You guys are a walking violation of the angel's creed as <br />
far as he's concerned. Only reason he hasn't attacked yet, is to give T and Janice a chance <br />
to train you guys the best they can't.... so Jasim can watch you all -fail- so he feels <br />
justified in just blowing up your friends if they get in the way... trust me.... it won't be a <br />
pleasant assault.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Violation?&quot; Lisa asked alarmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;.... T bent, some would even say broke some rules giving you guys the power to fight on <br />
his level... he knows he's in hot water no matter which way this conflict turns out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what happens to us?&quot; Lisa asked a little worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;You become functional, accepted weather anyone likes it or not, productive members of <br />
angel society.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa crossed her arms, &quot;Even though we're the ones who decided to let this be done to us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio shrugged, &quot;I'm not an angel...I don't know how they think. They'll figure Tabra <br />
tempted you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tempted?!&quot; Vicki said out loud, &quot;He was trying to scare us off every step of that road!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica and Lisa looked at their eldest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me you two didn't notice.&quot; <br />
<br />
Erica shook her head, &quot;It's not that, I just didn't think of it that way before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna was indignant, &quot;Well! This is the choice -I- made, I may not have asked to be a fox <br />
or a woman, but having my soul mutated was totally my -own- decision! Now I'm going <br />
up weather any of you are coming with me or not!&quot; <br />
<br />
'Hothead,' Vicki thought, &quot;Stop at once!&quot; <br />
<br />
Every muscle in Luna's body tightened. She didn't have a millimeter more. Her eyes rolled <br />
over to her eldest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tabra has more experience than any of us,&quot; Vicki said, &quot;And if she asked us not to sortie, <br />
then we'll abide by that, and that include you Luna, understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna thought over everything Vicki had just said and finally, replied with a sigh, her <br />
muscles suddenly no longer tightened in place, &quot;You're right... I just wish we could do <br />
something for her right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio said, &quot;You can get back to practicing... you're going to need every bit of it in a few <br />
hours...unless you guys intend to sit out while the djinn do all the work for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't bet on it.&quot; Luna said simply. &quot;But I'm seriously wondering how much a day's worth of <br />
training is going to be any good against the fox bastard and his puppets.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio sighed, &quot;It will be, if it's THE training... an emergency last resort for teaching angels <br />
how to fight... last time it was used was right after the civil war among Angels started. <br />
Mike and his loyalists never had a -reason- to know how to harm another entity before, <br />
but they had to learn fast or they'd never have a chance to learn... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't sound thrilled about it.&quot; Erica observed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your memories, and the you that makes you you, will be about the only part of you that's <br />
still the same when it done.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna of course didn't hesitate, &quot;When do we get started?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio was taken aback of course, as was Lisa and Erica, Vicki didn't seem surprised and <br />
seemed to have similar sentiments. &quot;Not until T and Janice do, or do NOT come back, T felt <br />
it was his duty to see it started, since he 'pushed' you into all of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only one who pushed any of us into anything was Karther.&quot; Erica said simply. <br />
<br />
