<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now then,&quot; said Frieda Knight, once she and her companions were finally alone within her bedroom. &quot;How would the two of you like to proceed?&quot; she asked, while locking the door and smiling at them seductively.<br />
&quot;Spencer and I talked about that last night over Skype while you were being tested for bi-polar disorder,&quot; said Eric Anderson. While looking at the ladies in his life, the penis of the white furred werepanther grew longer with happy thoughts over what was about to occur.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said the gray furred werepanthress, hopeful, tossing her robe aside as Eric approached her from one side and Spencer Lawson from the other.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the black furred hybrid werewolf/cat/panther hybrid. &quot;We want to show our love, friendship, and appreciation for you. Past, present, and future.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks to our bond, I already know how the two of you feel about me, and the feeling&#39;s mutual,&quot; said Frieda, before giving each of them a kiss.<br />
&quot;Good. Then let&#39;s dispense with the words and get on with the fun!&quot; said Eric, as he suddenly picked Frieda up in his arms and carried her over to her king sized bed while Spencer raced ahead to turn down the covers.<br />
Soon Frieda Knight found herself laying in the middle of the bed, with Eric on one side and Spencer on the other. The couple were alternating between kissing their partner and suckling the breast on their side, but each had a paw running between Frieda&#39;s furry thighs and caressing her now very damp vagina.<br />
&quot;Oooooohhhhh.....&quot; moaned Frieda, relishing in the attention even as her tail twitched in joy.<br />
&quot;The night is young,&quot; purred Eric...<br />
&quot;...and so are we,&quot; said Spencer seductively, as each began to tease and lick one of Frieda&#39;s ears, which they had discovered was a highly erogenous zone for all of them, even as the paws between her legs grew wetter.<br />
&quot;Yesssssss.....&quot; hissed Frieda, enjoying the first of what would be many orgasms that night. &quot;I&#39;m whole again.&quot;<br />
Eric and Spencer simply smiled at each other, feeling the joy passing through the three of them, before continuing to love their mutual friend.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
As Lance Knight came home, he noticed Lila Carpenter&#39;s red motorcycle parked in the other half of his double driveway and smiled.<br />
The house was dark as the werepanther entered, but he didn&#39;t think much of it, for they certainly didn&#39;t need much light at night, being able to see well in the dark.<br />
&quot;Lila?&quot; he called out, while locking the front door behind him.<br />
&quot;Back here dear,&quot; she replied. <i>WOW! A man who keeps his promises!,</i> thought Lila happily. <i>It isn&#39;t even 10 yet and he&#39;s already home for the night from the werepanther gathering. Guess he misses me as much as I miss him,</i> she realized.<br />
Lance entered the master bedroom he now shared with his girlfriend, stood in the doorway and smiled.<br />
While he was gone, Lila had turned the bed down for the evening, set up and lit a bunch of romantic candles, and was sitting in what the two of them now thought of as &#39;her&#39; side of the bed, reading a library book.<br />
Lance placed his tote bag of clothes and his ceremonial robe down, then came over to lie beside her on the bed. &quot;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i> by Ernest Hemingway, huh? Good book.&quot;<br />
&quot;While I like good mysteries and science fiction the best, I do like to read a wide variety of material, but please don&#39;t spoil it for me. I&#39;m only about half way through,&quot; requested Lila, as she placed her bookmark inside before setting the novel on the nightstand near her. &quot;Now then,&quot; she said, wrapping her arms around him and giving Lance a romantic kiss on the muzzle. &quot;How was the werepanther meeting?&quot;<br />
&quot;Basically the same as any other, except for Frieda over seeing the induction of her friends. Spencer Lawson as a hybrid wolf/cat/panther mix was interesting enough, but Eric Anderson having white fur, and all of them now having green eyes because of this &#39;unique bond&#39; they claim between them...&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? I&#39;d like to meet Frieda sometime.&quot;<br />
&quot;How about tomorrow afternoon? I&#39;m hoping to have a little get together at the paper to get to know Frieda&#39;s friends better,&quot; he explained.<br />
&quot;Being able to leave early depends upon how my day goes at work,&quot; replied Lila, thinking about her job as assistant comptroller for the town of Moon Lake. &quot;Besides, there&#39;s still our sleep over tomorrow night at the hospital,&quot; she reminded him.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Lance. &quot;Personally, I honestly don&#39;t think I have bi-polar disorder, but it will be nice to find out for sure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed, but if you do, we&#39;ll face it together,&quot; promised Lila. &quot;Now, before we waste any more of this romantic candlelight, I can think of more pleasant things to discuss,&quot; she added, while running a paw seductively across his furry chest while kissing him again.<br />
&quot;So can I,&quot; Lance said with a smile, before kissing his way down her furry neck and around the outer rim of her breasts.<br />
Soon Lance was orally caressing her breasts with his eager tongue while massaging them with one paw, as the other paw explored the wonders between her thighs.<br />
Lila moaned and pleaded with Lance to continue, anxious for his touch and the release that always seemed nearby but never arriving.<br />
The werepanther simply smiled at the weretigress, kissing his way down her striped body until reaching where his paw was. Then he placed his head between her now fully open legs and started exploring those same moist depths with his tongue.<br />
The moment the tip of his tongue touched her clit, Lila arched her body up to him for more even as she shook in pleasure from the orgasm that overtook her.<br />
&quot;Yess....&quot; purred his girlfriend, even as she ran her paws through his fur while keeping Lance&#39;s head pressed against her horny cunt.<br />
Lance continued to orally satisfy her for a bit, but just as Lila was about to experience another orgasm, he shifted positions to tease the head of his stiff werepanther cock against the moist outer lips of her pussy.<br />
Lila simply smiled and purred as Lance slowly sank into her, his penis going deep within her vagina.<br />
Soon their bodies were pressed against each other, panther and tigress fur intermingling as he completely filled her.<br />
Lance began running his paws across her breasts and every other part of Lila&#39;s body he could reach as his were-hood slowly withdrew and reentered her.<br />
In and out, back and forth, never fully leaving her clutching depths, but always completely filling her upon its return.<br />
Soon the two of them established a pleasant rhythm, but it wasn&#39;t long before the eagerness and hunger between Lila and Lance grew.<br />
With a simple nod of consent from her, Lance began plunging in and out of her faster, the barbs of his penis now rubbing against her inner tunnel with every movement.<br />
Lila just wrapped her arms and legs around him the best she could, even as she arched her body to urge him onward.<br />
Lance started thrusting harder, even grunting from the exertion occasionally as their tails started to twitch in unison as a sign of the sexual pleasures they were both experiencing.<br />
Yet sadly, all good things must come to an end.<br />
Lila&#39;s cunt flooded with her tigress juices even as Lance&#39;s cock filled her with hot werepanther cum. Only the fact she was on her specially formulated weretigress birth control pill prevented her from becoming pregnant that night, but Lila smiled at both the orgasmic bliss they had just shared and the happy thought that someday their love would allow her to bear him cubs as Mrs. Lila Knight.<br />
Spent, they held each other close and snuggled, until both drifted off to sleep in their partner&#39;s embrace.</p>
