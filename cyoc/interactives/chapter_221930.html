<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A flash blinded Jennifer. Suddenly, she felt the warmth of the summer Glendale sun beating down on her. Below her, sandy, dry dirt. Her head was pounding. She couldn&#39;t feel her fingers, and her neck felt cramped, bent in ways it shouldn&#39;t have been able to. Her tail was pinched under her thigh. Something was wrong.<br />
<br />
<i>Wait wait wait... my tail?!</i> she thought, panicked. She threw herself upwards in a panic, practically hyperventilating as her consciousness returned with a vengeance. Then her vision continued in a blurred arc. And continued. And continued. And then it slammed into the ground in front of her. Her arms fluttered strangely at her sides in a doomed attempt to grab her throbbing head.<br />
<br />
As her vision stabilized, the shock set in. Everything felt wrong, because everything was wrong. She turned her head around, her neck much more flexible than it had been. Its brown, wrinkled skin appeared in her peripheral vision. She stretched it out. It was almost 5 feet long, and it didn&#39;t feel like there were any vertebrae. It was obvious. <i>An elephant&#39;s trunk!</i><br />
<br />
It scared her, but it also felt... right, almost. As if she&#39;d always had it, instead of a boring, short human neck.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered, as Kyle had said, &quot;[...] leaving you with complete control of whatever form you have.&quot; She felt more confident as the movements fell into place, her neck twisting and turning under her command. Her arms fluttered again, and she turned her head around to look at them.<br />
<br />
In place of her arms were the full-sized ears of an African elephant. They fluttered against her torso, dwarfing it. Instinctively, she stretched them out. It felt like t-posing, but without any bones. Each ear-arm was almost 6 feet long and 5 feet wide, and from her seated position they dragged against the ground considerably. She stood up, finding it difficult to rise without any arms for balance. The tone of her legs and torso felt off. She was clearly very strong, but her body also jiggled in ways she knew it hadn&#39;t before, her much larger breasts rubbing against a heavier belly.<br />
<br />
As she teetered for a second, her trunk-neck swooped around, allowing her to view her body from an almost third party perspective. She took it in. In place of her arms were her ears, long and blowing in the light breeze. She fanned them, feeling them graze against the dirt even while she stood. Her neck, an elephant&#39;s trunk, long and prehensile. She was much curvier now, her breasts reaching her navel and her hips jutting out with fat. Her thighs were as big as her old torso, and her belly had definitely grown. She was also a bit hairier, and completely nude. Gone was slim Jenny, in was Elephant Jenny, shaped like a paleolithic figurine. But then why did her face feel weird?<br />
<br />
She looked around. She had been too engrossed by the changes to her body to even notice where she was. The sandy dirt, the distant trees. The fence. The large building off in the corner. The waterfall to her left. It was obvious. She was at the zoo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely I&#39;m not an animal, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shock ran through her. That was not her voice. Gone was her high, soprano voice. Instead, it sounded like if an elephant could talk through its nose. She fought back tears. Was it not enough to be an armless, trunk-necked freak? Now she had to sound like an elephant, too?!<br />
<br />
She stumbled forward, determined to see her reflection. Something about her face still felt off. Like it had... no, it couldn&#39;t, could it? She ran, her ear-arms flapping in the wind and catching on small rocks and sticks as she dragged them to the waterfront. In the still pool, she saw her reflection. Her neck instinctively bent into an s-shape, and she trumpeted in despair.<br />
<br />
Her face was... different. Situated at the end of her trunk were two elephant-sized nostrils. The breath passing through them was now obvious to her, much more air than her old nose was capable of. The smells overwhelmed her. But the rest of her face caused tears to well up. Crammed between her nostrils and the tips of her trunk were her human eyes, and, below her nostrils, her human mouth. Afterthoughts. When she talked, she felt the air pass through her mouth like it was just a third nostril. And to top it all off, above her eyes and below her mouth were the two finger-like appendages at the end of an African elephant&#39;s trunk. That&#39;s why her face felt weird. Her head wasn&#39;t even her head anymore, just the nose of an elephant, awkwardly stuck onto the shoulders of a cheerleader. Hair capped the end of the trunk, adding insult to injury every time it blew into her face. She closed her trunk&#39;s appendages like a fist, her entire face scrunching up between them. She couldn&#39;t even keep her eyes open if she was holding something, and her arms were worse than useless to help her navigate.<br />
<br />
But worse than that, the thought struck her. If her mouth were simply just another nostril, how would she eat? She unfurled her trunk-face and looked down, and realized she now had a second mouth. At the base of her trunk was an opening, part elephant, part human. It was her mouth. Right above her ample chest, to which some of the elephant&#39;s mass had been added. She opened it, the feeling foreign as her shoulder blades pulled back. Opening her mouth caused her to push out her breasts provocatively, but she was too focused on her changes to care. Her cavernous new mouth was a freakish mixture of elephant and human. At the back, she had huge elephantine molars, albeit shrunk down to better fit on her human torso. There were also a few human teeth, allowing her to continue her omnivorous diet, and her tongue had grown until it barely fit, to better press plant matter against her palette. She could hardly believe what she was seeing. <i>I merged with an elephant!</i><br />
<br />
As she gazed back down at her body, she took in her other changes. Her legs and calves were thicker than they had been, her feet stubbier, more evidence of her elephantine merger. Calloused and round, with no need for shoes, the dirt barely registered underfoot. 5 year old Elephant Jenny cried as she was told she didn&#39;t need shoes like the other girls, the memory fighting for space with pre-curse 5 year old Jenny proudly sporting the fanciest kid&#39;s sneakers in town, her (former) vanity running deep. She felt something brush against the back of her calves, snapping her back into the moment. Her tail.<br />
<br />
Right above her now-ample ass was the tail of an elephant, idly swishing. The little tuft of hair on the end was the same as on her trunk-head. It tickled her legs a bit, but she couldn&#39;t scratch it. She stomped in frustration as her ear-arms shook, and a small trumpet exited her face.<br />
<br />
A sudden squeeze on her ass caused a louder trumpet as she turned around, suddenly painfully aware of her nudity, only to find...</p>
