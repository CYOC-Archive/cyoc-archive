<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan made sure that Jerry would remain proportionate to whatever height he would become, essentially ensuring that Jerry would just shrink an inch every time he achieved orgasm. Ethan delayed the onset of the transformation to the 12 hours between 7 PM and 7 AM. Tonight would definitely be a show as Jerry asked the overeager Sarah out to dinner. Ethan smirked as he watched the two interns walk out, doing their best to hide the hands they were holding like the overgrown kids they were. That gave Ethan another idea to try, but he figured he&#39;d save that for tomorrow night.<br />
<br />
After work, Ethan went to the gym and followed it up with dinner and a shower before he opened his Chronivac laptop and began to watch the show. Just like he&#39;d predicted, Ethan and Sarah were hardly in the door and they had their hands and lips all over each other as they fumbled disrobing and making their way to the bedroom. They didn&#39;t make their intended destination, instead settling for the couch where Jerry first came.<br />
<br />
Jerry as a fresh faced intern straight out of school was shorter than his brawny 30 year old persona, but still a respectable 6&#39;1&quot;, only now it was 6 foot even. This was going to take a while for there to be a noticeable difference.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready again for round two so soon?&quot; asked Sarah as Jerry&#39;s member resumed its erection after a brief pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I um... say? I uh... like what I see,&quot; stumbled Jerry with that boyish charm he had.<br />
<br />
And with that they were at it again and no sooner than had Jerry thrusted into Sarah than he&#39;d orgasmed again, shrinking to 5&#39;11&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick to the draw... before I even got there,&quot; commented Sarah, somewhat disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I hadn&#39;t finished from the first one,&quot; said Jerry with a blush, which won him back some brownie points with Sarah.<br />
<br />
They did it one more time on the couch before abandoning the living room for the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just like the energizer bunny,&quot; said Sarah as his erection returned as they entered the door. Jerry hadn&#39;t yet noticed that he was only an inch or so taller than Sarah now. His mind was so caught up with how horny he was feeling that he hadn&#39;t taken stock of the growing world around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really like you,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like me? Please, you really like fucking me,&quot; said Sarah as she pushed Jerry onto the bed and decided to ride him, an experience so new and thrilling to Jerry that he orgasmed, came erect again inside Sarah and orgasmed again twice more before finding it odd that Sarah&#39;s vagina felt so roomy for his penis when it had felt tight earlier. That was likely just his imagination playing tricks on him, he figured--and after a good fucking, whose vagina wouldn&#39;t be a bit stretched out--he guessed. It wasn&#39;t until he shrank to 5&#39;4&quot; that Sarah started feeling heavy on top of him, and Sarah started to notice how much... smaller Jerry looked than this morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jerry, let&#39;s hit the pause button,&quot; she said as he came once again as she pulled herself off of him. She urged him to stand up, to which his dick obeyed before he&#39;d swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood up only to have to look up to meet Sarah&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot; asked Jerry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was about to ask the same thing--until I saw you shrink right under me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, shrink?!&quot; for what it was worth, Jerry didn&#39;t entirely burst into laughter at the idea, it would explain how barely an hour or two ago he&#39;d been looking down at Sarah, but now could barely look over her shoulders. He looked over his body, it still looked the same, it was just in relation to everything else it seemed smaller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it happened when you came,&quot; said Sarah. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; exclaimed Jerry, his dick aching to go again despite circumstances.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it sounds crazy, but it&#39;s what I saw... and felt,&quot; explained Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s--that&#39;s impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I&#39;ll prove it to you. Sit down,&quot; ordered Sarah, pushing him back onto the edge of the bed with a bit more force than Jerry was used to from a woman, emphasizing how much smaller he was. Sarah joined him and wrapped her hand around his dick, which felt oddly larger than it had earlier in the night--but he... oh... oh... oh! With a splat he ejaculated once... then twice... then three... four times onto the floor as Sarah didn&#39;t stop once he&#39;d orgasmed once, but kept working through the orgasms as he recovered quicker than ever. Jerry felt a weird tingling course through his body as the room seemed to shift slightly--but the most noticeable feeling came from his feet leaving the floor and dangling like a kid&#39;s off the side of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;d you... whoa!&quot; exclaimed Jerry as he slide to stand up only to find himself really looking up to Sarah. He was the height of a kid now definitely, but his body was still that of an adult&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;See what I mean? Sorry to put you below five foot, but you believe me now, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; exclaimed Jerry, suddenly realizing she was right. He was shrinking every time he came.<br />
<br />
Ethan sat at his computer watching Jerry freak out and Sarah trying to calm him down--badly. Truth be told, it was more fun to imagine than it was to actually watch someone freak out like this... and maybe an inch an orgasm was too much, especially given Jerry&#39;s refractory reset time was basically nil. Feeling rather unsatisfied at the experiment, Ethan decided to end the transformation early. It was one thing to boss around Jerry in a kind of Saturnalian role switch, that had been a lot of fun today, but this was taking things a bit too far, even for someone as much of a jerk as the old brawny Jerry used to be. Now he was essentially torturing a kid, not the asshat that that kid would become.<br />
<br />
But maybe there was a way to do that, and still get the freakout from Jerry... he&#39;d have to return the kid back to his normal proportions--maybe while he slept--that would make the evening feel like it was just a dream--which would help reset things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a freak! No! Don&#39;t touch me, I don&#39;t wanna get smaller!&quot; cried out Jerry as Sarah pulled the crying little man close to her and into a hug. A show of compassion for whatever he was going through that eventually Jerry gave up resisting and accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just get some sleep and I can take you to the doctor in the morning,&quot; suggested Sarah, now feeling somewhat motherly to the child-sized man instead of attracted to him. The two of them settled into Jerry&#39;s bed and Sarah spooned the much smaller man, which Jerry found warmth and comfort in.<br />
<br />
Ethan set that Jerry would revert to his normal height over the course of his sleep and then set the next transformation...</p>
