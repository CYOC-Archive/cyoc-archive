<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hiding under the clothes, I smelled a lot more then I cared for. I could smell Paul as she hid under the bed, her dirty clothes that I was laying under and her mother. This was something new to me because I had never known that humans had a smell to them. Paul's mother had an oily smell to her that was covered up by a perfume that tickled my nose.<br />
<br />
To keep myself from sneezing, I let my mind wander. I liked furry, just not enough to want to be trapped in the body of a vixen for all eternity. Shifting about, I felt something funny on my stomach. Moving deeper into the pile of laundry, I shifted till I could see my belly. What I saw nearly made me gasp in alarm.<br />
<br />
Dotting down were six erect teats. Not knowing about animal anatomy, I wondered if this was normal. Presently Paul's mom left and I crawled out of the closet. Seeing Paul come from out from under the bed, I whispered to her, &quot;Do you have six teats?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul gave me a weird look and nodded, but then added before I could say anything, &quot;But I think it's because these bodies are going through a heat cycle. I can certainly smell it coming off you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanting to deny this, I merely groaned in annoyance. Paul ignored my noise and moved across the room and began to rooting about the closet. Presently she returned with a note clasped firmly in her mouth. Laying the note down on the floor, she began to stare at it intently, before she finally sighed in frustration and looked at me and said, &quot;Something is wrong, because I can't read this note.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alarmed, but curious, I walked over to where she was sitting and tried to make sense of the scribbling on the note. After a bit I gave up and wondering if it was just the note, I made my way to Paul's desk.<br />
<br />
Jumping up onto the chair and then placing my front paws on the desk, I tried to make sense of the book in front of me.<br />
<br />
Staring at that made absolute sense to me and jumping down from the chair; I said to Paul, &quot;It's much worse. I don't think we totally went fox, but I don't think we're totally human either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that mean?&quot; Paul barked in alarm.<br />
<br />
Trying to make a shushing noise, I only succeeded in hissing at the vixen in front of me. After giving that up, I began to explain an idea that was forming; mainly we still had a bit of human in us, such as the ability to make human speech, but had also mixed in us some fox. Asking her what colour I was also confirmed what I already knew, that we were colour blind like most animals, and I explained to Paul this.<br />
<br />
Wondering what to do next, Paul stated the obvious and said we had to leave. Her mother didn't allow pets and would certainly pitch a fit if she found two foxes in the house. Picking up the note, Paul turned tail and started to make her way out of the room.<br />
<br />
Hurrying to catch up with her, I whispered after her, &quot;Why are you bringing the note?&quot;<br />
<br />
Laying the invoice down, she said to me, &quot;I may not know how to read at this point, but that certainly isn't going from stop me from trying to relearn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having no argument to this, I followed Paul out of her room, down the stairs, through the kitchen and out an old and unused doggy door. Outside I breathed deeply the night air, suddenly aware of how many smells were around me. Some instinct I didn't know about kicked in and I took off across the lawn, Paul shortly behind me.<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
After we left the backyard we scampered across a neighbor’s yard and into the forest. Paul lived on the edge of the town and now I was glad of such a fact. Losing Paul among the trees didn't bother me at all.<br />
<br />
It really didn't bother me until I smelled something that set off another instinct. It was the smell of a Reynard and he was looking to court some vixen. Trying to control myself proved futile and I eventually lost the battle of wills. Seeking out the male fox, I raised my tail in a teasing and coy fashion.<br />
<br />
The moment he got near, I was off like a shot from a gun. This game went on for a couple hours and it was obvious that both of us enjoyed it. Finally I paused in a thicket and raising my tail in front of him so that he could mount me.<br />
<br />
Not really realizing what I was doing, I lost myself in this body, in its instincts and the fact that I for some reason wanted this Reynard's penis in my vagina.<br />
<br />
Afterward we resumed our game, with the outcome always ending the same; him mounting me. Finally we curled up together under a bush and fell asleep, my previous life drifting some where outside my consciousness and all thoughts of Paul not anywhere on my mind.<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
I awoke with a start. The Reynard had gone. Had I known anything about foxes, I would have known that foxes usually mate for life and he had probably just gone for breakfast. Worried because he wasn't present and because another instinct told me I was carrying his young, I stretched and made my way out of the bush. Hungry, I began to search for my breakfast.<br />
<br />
Being a teenager, your breakfast is usually served by your mother. Now as a fox, I had to hunt for my food. Luckily I had an untapped reserve of instincts on how to go about getting my food.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, I began to search for Paul. My human side back in control, I was worried not only about her, but also about the fact that I may be pregnant. After a bit of searching I found Paul. Looking rather forlorn, she told me, &quot;I lost the note.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure how to respond to this, and not really sure I should tell her about my predicament, I sat down next to her. After an awkward bit of silence I said to her, &quot;Well we can't sit here crying and whining about it. We need a course of action. One that will get you back the note and one that will get us both back our humanity. So what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at me, and for the moment I was glad that I'd left out about the part of the Reynard. Opening up her snout, she nodded and said to me, &quot;Your right. We need to.....&quot;</p>
