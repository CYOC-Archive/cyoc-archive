<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes, I promise,&quot; I replied hesitantly. I don&#39;t know what I expected. She slowly reached her arm up as though asking me to help her to her feet. I reached out and gripped her forearm to leverage her up. Instead of moving she simply looked up at me with pink, glowing eyes and smiled mischievously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, you&#39;re a life-saver.&quot; There was a flash of white light and I awoke with a start. I paused for a moment... uncertain as to what had just happened. It was Saturday morning and I had obviously slept in considering the sun had risen and was illuminating my room with its rays. <br />
<br />
Was that just a dream? I thought to myself. Without a second thought I reached over and grabbed my glasses, placing them on so I could see my surroundings more clearly. I rose up to a near sitting position only to notice a strange weight on my waist. Looking down I saw an arm that most definitely didn&#39;t belong to me. Almost terrified I slowly looked over, my eyes following the arm to find the girl from the night before. &quot;Wh-what the hell?!&quot; I screamed, falling off the bed. <br />
<br />
The girl didn&#39;t respond but simply opened her eyes slowly and sleepily, rustling herself to a sideways sitting position which was a mixture of sexy and innocent. &quot;What&#39;s wrong my love?&quot; she smiled, rubbing her eyes. She looked different from before. Her face was very small and feminine with narrow jawline and impossibly high cheekbones that made her look like she was always smiling. Her eyes were an impossible aquamarine hue and her hair which used to be jet black was now a nice shade of red. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn I love Redheads,&quot; I thought to myself. Her changes didn&#39;t stop there. She wore a pink satin nightgown with black lace and a strap that hung freely from her shoulder. Her breasts looked much bigger than last night, definitely double Ds with pert nipples almost pointing skyward and so pointed I&#39;d swore they would have poked all the way through the fabric. My eyes continued southward, her stomach flat and waist slim but those birthing hips! She had fair skin but her curves reminded me of latina women. Her legs just served to compliment her figure as they were both long and slender with no thigh gap whatsoever. Even her toes appeared sexy. Her toes! Who the fuck notices that?<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, baby? Last night not enough for you?&quot; the girl smirked, edging towards me, her tits falling forward as though inviting me. I could feel the tightness in my shorts. Holy shit was she sexy, and she was in my bed in a nightgown. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Jethro. I can go all night and all day,&quot; she cooed as she made her advance to the floor and then my crotch. <br />
<br />
Suddenly I heard a latch click and the door to my room swing open. &quot;Jethro, it&#39;s time to- Oh, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; screamed Alyssa as she stood in my door taking in the sight of this beautiful and scantily clad redhead about to eat my morning wood for an appetizer. Alyssa was my adopted sister and she had a knack for reminding me of it. I didn&#39;t want anyone to see me like this but holy shit this was bad. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry Jethro! I didn&#39;t think- I mean- I&#39;m sorry Lara!&quot; Alyssa blushed deep red and screamed as she closed the door and rushed downstairs. I could still hear her footsteps and her franctically talking to my mom before I finally snapped out of my shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Lara?&quot; I asked, turning to the redhead who had now exposed my manhood to the world.<br />
&quot;Yes dear,&quot; she asked, caressing my head with her cheek. Damn her skin was silky soft!<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes dear,&quot; she acknowledged, giving my head a playful lick. The sensation made me twitch. &quot;Aw... he is so happy this morning,&quot; she cooed. <br />
&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Lara, just as you said dear,&quot; she answered, inching the head of my dick into her mouth. I felt myself slipping away but fortunately my brain did something that no other man&#39;s would: override my erection. Yeah, I know, I can hear your criticisms already but come on. The worst fears I had were things like: waking up from a years-long coma, being date raped, and catching an STD. All of these things were now possible and the Lara chick seemed to be the one with the answers. Damn she was hot but hell, HIV isn&#39;t worth anybody. I leapt to my feet and bounded over to the door, gripping the handle. I would have sprinted out if it weren&#39;t for Lara. &quot;Jethro, you don&#39;t plan to leave without getting dressed do you?&quot; she asked. With that she snapped her fingers and a pair of shorts and a t-shirt materialized onto my body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- how did you do that?!&quot; I stammered.<br />
&quot;Why magic of course,&quot; came her gleeful answer. I didn&#39;t wait for another explanation as I practically ripped the door off of its hinges and raced down the stairs into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Mom was in the kitchen cooking breakfast while Alyssa stood red-faced with a glass of orange juice in her hand and dressed in her jogging wear. &quot;Oh, good morning, Jethro, &quot; she called to me, spatula in hand and smiling like I&#39;ve never seen her smile before. &quot;Have a seat, breakfast will be done in a minute.&quot; I just stood there. Not only was I trying to cope with the existance of Lara but everything else in the house felt weird too. Mom never cooked, nor did she ever seem to acknowledge me much. I almost figured she resented me because I was a constant reminder of the son she could never have had. Then there was Alyssa who had made a habit of being an outright ass to me. Unlike Mom who was passive in her dislike, Alyssa was all active. Now, though, she was courteous, tolerant, and even... thinner? Don&#39;t get me wrong, Alyssa was never fat, but ever since she reached her respective height of 5&#39;8&quot; she started chunking up a bit, reaching 175lbs before deciding to go on a health kick. Now, she didn&#39;t have a gut, or love handles. She looked lean and I could even make out a hint of a six pack under her athletic shirt. She obviously had the legs of a runner, small biceps that showed she paid some attention to upper body strength, and her hair which usually hung long and free was now wrapped neatly in a pony tail that came to her shoulder blades and no further. She was definitely taking care of herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Jethro,&quot; Dad&#39;s jovial greeting was followed by a hearty slap on the shoulder. Well, that was normal at least. It was Dad&#39;s idea to adopt me in the first place and he had constantly made every effort to make me feel welcome. I actually wouldn&#39;t have been going to college at all if it weren&#39;t for him. He moved over to Mom and planted a kiss on her, but not just any kiss, this was a deep, tongue in her mouth kind of kiss. The kind where the man would wrap his arm around the woman and bend her backwards kind of kiss. This went on for a good minute before Alyssa, once again red-faced protested to the extensive PDA. &quot;Oh, sorry, Alyssa. Can&#39;t help that I love your mother,&quot; Dad stated, sitting down at the table with his faux apology. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Alyssa sputtered. <br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t mind her, dear. She just walked in on Jethro this morning-&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Alyssa protested again. Just then I saw Lara enter the room wearing tight jeans and a summer shirt whose plunging neckline showed off her bountiful cleavage nicely. <br />
&quot;Good morning, Lara,&quot; Mom and Dad said simultaneously and casually. Once again I was left stunned as Lara nonchalantly greeted the family and planted a kiss on my dad&#39;s cheek. &quot;Lara, I didn&#39;t know you spent the night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? Could have sworn Alyssa already told you,&quot; Lara replied, flashing a teasing smile at my sister who once again blushed deep red. &quot;See anything you like?&quot; Lara asked, leaning over to show even more of her generous rack. Alyssa side-stepped to escape and headed towards the door rather unsettled. <br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m going for a run,&quot; she sputtered, bolting out onto the street. <br />
&quot;Lara please stop teasing Alyssa. You know she&#39;s uncomfortable about that,&quot; Mom pleaded, scooping an omelet onto Lara&#39;s plate and one onto mine. <br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why I like her so much,&quot; Dad interjected, chuckling to himself as Mom gave him a rebuking but playful slap. I didn&#39;t want to make a scene so I just decided to settle in and eat breakfast. Everyone was acting strange yet all behaved as though this was normal. It was an agonizing breakfast, each minute feeling like an eternity as I tried to piece together what had just happened to my family. <br />
&quot;So, today&#39;s the big day. Are you two excited?&quot; Mom asked. I looked at her, having no idea what she was on about. <br />
&quot;Wh-what&#39;s today?&quot; I asked nervously.<br />
&quot;Why your first day of college of course! The advanced positioning course...&quot; she continued as though trying to jog my memory of something unknown to me. <br />
&quot;Oh, yes we are so excited,&quot; Lara interjected, grabbing my arm and rubbing up on my shoulder like those couples in the movies. <br />
&quot;Are you worried about being in separate dorms?&quot; Mom asked.<br />
&quot;No. We probably won&#39;t have roommates for a month until regular courses start. Then we&#39;ll just visit each other for sex. If the roommates want to watch I&#39;m good with that,&quot; Lara giggled. <br />
<br />
Dad laughed while Mom just rolled her eyes and shook her head. We finished our breakfast and then headed upstairs back to my room. Dad said his goodbyes to Mom and headed off to work. I wanted to have some time alone, to try and sort out what was going on but just as I closed the door and turned I found Lara sitting cross-legged on my bed. &quot;How the fuck?!&quot; I screamed, remembering how I had left her downstairs in the kitchen with Mom who was washing dishes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice family,&quot; Lara mused, kicking her foot out repeatedly and leaning back on her arms. &quot;Or, they are now at least.&quot;<br />
By this time I was fed up. I had had just about enough of this shit and I was going to get some answers from her. I balled up my fists and stepped forward. &quot;Alright, Bitch, I don&#39;t know who you are, or what you are, but something weird is going on here and I want answers.&quot; I towered over her, trying to be imposing. First she raised an eyebrow, then smirked, then laughed. Just like that I lost every ounce of violent resolve I had. Her laugh was so cute, so sexy, and so disarming. I didn&#39;t even care if she was laughing at me, it was just nice to hear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jethro, don&#39;t ever try to be the tough guy,&quot; she smiled, composing herself. &quot;It never works for guys like you. You want to know what&#39;s going on? I&#39;ll tell you, but you have to listen very closely and believe everything I say. I hate repeating myself after all.&quot; That did not sound reasonable at all, but then again, nothing seemed logical today so I just decided to go with it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine,&quot; I sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Now then, introductions. I&#39;m Lara, a succubus.&quot; She stopped, waiting to see my reaction. All I did was stare and blink. Under normal circumstances I would have laughed at her and called it bullshit but... she did use magic a little bit ago, my whole family treats her like an old friend and I just met her last night, and she&#39;s sexy as hell- wait a minute!<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re a demon...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lara twisted her head, as though she were trying to formulate a coherent answer. &quot;Well... not really... I mean, not in the way you conceive demons. I&#39;m more like a fairy I guess. It&#39;s hard to explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try,&quot; I demanded, folding my arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, imagine I&#39;m a fairy,&quot; she said, gesturing with her hands as she walked me through her explanation. &quot;My kind are powerful and magical. We&#39;ve existed for almost all of time, but we get our magic from sexual energy. Without sex we eventually lose power and die. So we just have to keep finding ways to fuck and we can progressively get more powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re not here to steal my soul?&quot; I asked wishfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not. Why without a soul how will I get any of that wonderful seed of yours? That was just some lie people spread about us to prevent humanity from hunting us down and fucking the shit out of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would anyone care about that?&quot; I asked. &quot;If it&#39;s consensual who cares?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well think about it: sex makes us powerful so crazy amounts of sex makes us crazy powerful. Would you want a handful of succubi ruling the world?&quot; she asked. I couldn&#39;t tell if she was trying to get something from me or deter me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... I guess not...?&quot; I answered without certainty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re not really into that anymore. All those world domination crazies died off with the Roman Empire. Now we just like to find a good fuck and carry on with our lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what&#39;s happened to my family?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that. Well, I&#39;ll be honest with you, Jethro. Your family- kinda horrible. I couldn&#39;t possibly spend the rest of my days with them so I just decided to give them a little... tweak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on,&quot; I raised my hand to stop her, my head spinning from the little bit that she said. &quot;What do you mean spend the rest of your days with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah I&#39;m sorry I skipped ahead a bit. Let me start over. So last night I was really low on energy. I mean I couldn&#39;t even walk. Then you came along and made that promise. When you did that, I took your essence, and in that moment our souls latched onto each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;L-latched onto each other?&quot; I stammered.<br />
&quot;In other words, darling, we&#39;re mates!&quot; she squeeled, smiling broadly and blushing slightly. <br />
&quot;Wait, what does that mean?&quot; I asked again.<br />
&quot;Why, I guess you could say it makes us married, but deeper than that.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I mean what does that entail. I&#39;ve never met your kind before I don&#39;t know what mating means.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, um... well think of it this way: I feed off sexual energy. As my mate you&#39;ve become my battery. All of your sexual energy is mine for the taking. Until you die anyway.&quot; <br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound good,&quot; I muttered. <br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry hun, being my mate comes with a lot of perks. You have access to my magic after all, and guess what, you&#39;ll stay young and live a lot longer than most humans. That and the best part: you&#39;ll have as much sex as you want.&quot;<br />
I had to admit, this did sound pretty good, though I was still having a hard time buying it. &quot;So what all did you do to my family.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing much. I just used magic to deepen everyone&#39;s connection to you, gave your mother a heeping shot of joy, turned back your father and mother&#39;s biological clock a few decades, and made Alyssa a sweet, innocent girl with a passion for fitness. Oh, and of course filled them all with memories of me.&quot;<br />
&quot;They... they think we&#39;re together?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, yes, but we are together. Forever, whether you like it or not.&quot; Our conversation was interrupted by a honk of the horn. Mom was in the minivan signalling for us. &quot;Looks like it&#39;s time for school,&quot; Lara announced, seeming to teleport to the door with our bags. I didn&#39;t want to end the conversation as I had more questions than answers but I just had to deal. She mentioned turning back the clock on Mom and now that I took a closer look at her in the mirror I could see it. Her crow&#39;s feet and smile lines were gone, wrinkles smoothed out to giver her a youthful complexion and her hair... I&#39;d never seen it so full or dark before. I stared the entire drive to the university, she even caught me a few times, to which all I could do was compliment her, or say I loved her. She would always reply with a smile, and &#39;I love you too,&#39; or asking if I was okay. I almost cried once because she sounded so ernest as though she actually loved me. I still wasn&#39;t sure about Lara who sat in the seat next to me, but I knew that if everything was like this I wouldn&#39;t mind be a succubus&#39; mate. I wanted to ask more questions but didn&#39;t have time. The entire morning was nothing but registration, admissions, and goodbyes. Lara and I both gave our heartfelt goodbyes to Mom who nearly cried when she finally drove away. We grabbed lunch and sat in a courtyard that seemed to be a favorite hangout spot for students and faculty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Lara,&quot; I muttered, sitting and staring at nothing in particular. She sat with her ankles crossed like a prim and proper lady while eating a sandwich. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; She answered.<br />
&quot;You said you have magic powers right?&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Sure do!&quot; she replied enthusiastically. &quot;Why, wanna play?&quot;<br />
The way she asked that gave me chills. &quot;Can you do whatever you want whenever you want?&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;No... there are limits. Higher level spells require a lot of power, which means a LOT of sex.&quot;<br />
&quot;So... can you warp reality?&quot;<br />
She nearly choked on her sandwich. &quot;Whoa, starting with the big guns huh? I suppose I can if I get powerful enough. But even the most powerful succubi in history had to have several orgies and save up for years to do something that big. At the end of the day it&#39;s not worth it.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; I asked confused. I mean, warping reality is like having the power of god. Who wouldn&#39;t put in the work for that?<br />
&quot;Warping reality is like trying to tear it up and reconstruct it. Now imagine if I tear this shirt a little. You know, a really small tear. Any idea how much time and effort it&#39;ll take to sew it back together?&quot; I shook my head. &quot;Now that&#39;s just a tiny tear. Imagine I rip the thing to confetti... Truth is, those who warped reality could only really tweak it after putting it back together. You can&#39;t do anything drastic or it won&#39;t fit the way it should.&quot;<br />
&quot;But... you changed my whole family in one night,&quot; I protested.<br />
&quot;Oh, that was different,&quot; she explained, wagging a finger. &quot;I didn&#39;t change reality, I altered their physiques and their perceptions of reality. It&#39;s different.&quot;<br />
&quot;How?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s limits. For example: your whole family knows me cause I scrambled their memories. They think we&#39;ve been dating since you were sixteen and that we went to the prom together and that that&#39;s when I took your virginity. But you ask the neighbors or your classmates about me, and I don&#39;t exist, they&#39;ve never met me. Thing is, it&#39;s a lot easier to explain away old friends and acquaintances rather than family members not knowing me. Hell, if it were up to me, they&#39;d think we were married. But, with marriage comes portfolios and momentos so, I just settled with dating. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll get my own wedding,&quot; she smirked. <br />
&quot;You wish,&quot; I growled, finding her vanity grating. <br />
&quot;Why? I&#39;d let you fuck the bridesmaids, as many as you like,&quot; she smiled. I had to admit, she knew how to appeal to my carnal side. Still, she had claimed to have all this power while I hadn&#39;t actually seen it in action. <br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;m not sure I believe any of this,&quot; I sputtered, standing up. &quot;If you really have magic, why don&#39;t you prove it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, very well. I suppose I can whip up something for you,&quot; she grumbled, stretching. &quot;We&#39;ve got a gathering of subjects... what would you like me to do?&quot;</p>
