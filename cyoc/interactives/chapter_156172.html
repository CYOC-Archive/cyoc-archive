<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle dreamed he was walking down the hall, hips swaying seductively as he passed through the crowd of classmates. He was dressed like a total slut: his Japanese schoolgirl uniform was something straight out of a lingerie store, but he didn&#39;t care; he loved the attention. And boy, was he getting it. Guys drooled over him, or whistled, or grabbed his ass beneath his miniskirt. Girls bit their lips and winked. Everyone, everyone was staring at him, their hands roaming over his body as he walked by. He was the school slut, and he loved it. <br />
<br />
When he walked into his next class, every pair of eyes in the room locked onto him. With a girlish giggle, Kyle flipped his long hair and asked, &quot;Well, is everyone ready?&quot; His answer came in the form of all of his classmates getting up from their desks at once. Two football players on the front row came over, hefted him off of his feet, and threw him roughly down face up on the teacher&#39;s desk. One of them grabbed Kyle&#39;s massive dick and began stroking it to erection while the other turned to the class and shouted, &quot;Alright everyone, you know the drill. Line up and you&#39;ll all get a turn. There&#39;s plenty of boypussy for everyone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s heart lept with excitement as he saw Josh make his way to the front of the line. The dreamy boy shot him a wink that made Kyle just melt inside. Having worked Kyle up to a massive 12-inch boner, the football player on his left stopped pumping and gestured for Josh to go ahead. Kyle squealed with anticipation and spread his legs, exposing his bare asshole to the cool air. He was going to get fucked! he was going to get fucked by everyone in this entire room, starting with his Joshy! <br />
<br />
Now Josh was approaching, swollen cock in hand. He was ready. There was burning lust in his eyes. Kyle&#39;s hole puckered in excitement and he squeezed his eyes closed, waiting for the moment.<br />
<br />
Kyle woke up, a strange sensation coming from his asshole, something he&#39;d never felt before. But it wasn&#39;t Josh&#39;s dick. No, that had just been a dream. It was cum, Josh&#39;s cum oozing out of him onto the desk. Pleasant memories of his lunchtime dalliance with the gorgeous blonde filled Kyle&#39;s head, only to be driven away moments later by remorse and guilt. <br />
<br />
He struggled to sit up, un-sticking himself from the desk. What was wrong with him? He wasn&#39;t gay, no! Josh was just a really attractive dude and there wasn&#39;t anything wrong with two guys appreciating each others&#39; bodies, taking their clothes off, making out a little... but why did Kyle have to go and be such a fag, letting Josh fuck him like that? And letting people film?! What had gotten into him? This was terrible. He was never going to live this down. Even if he did manage to track down Jen and undo her curse, his reputation was ruined.<br />
<br />
Kyle sat there on the desk, sulking. His throat was dry, his ass was sore and his back, face, chest, and clothes were all splattered with cum.   <br />
<br />
Cum. There was so much of it.<br />
<br />
He trembled for a moment, struggling in vain to resist the urge that had suddenly asserted itself over him. &quot;No, don&#39;t. That&#39;s disgusting. You can&#39;t...&quot; <br />
<br />
With a whimper, Kyle leaned down and began licking up the cum off the desk. It was sooooo good. So salty and filling. Mmmm. His sounds of shame soon turned to moans of delight as he surrendered to the flavor of the hot, sticky nectar. He lapped as much up off the desk as he could find and then moved on to his body, scooping up every drop of the delicious, pearly substance that he could find and licking his fingers clean.<br />
<br />
At that moment the bell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; Students would be coming in soon, walking in on him like this. He had to move, had to go somewhere. Where? The bathroom! Yes, he had to clean himself off before his next class. Kyle sprang to his feet, and walked (with some difficulty--his ass was quite sore) to the door, peeking outside and hoping desperately that nobody would see him.<br />
<br />
His hopes were in vain. The hall outside was packed with students. There was no way he was getting out without being spotted. He would just have to make a run for it.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Kyle stepped out into the hall and made a beeline for the bathroom as quickly as he could. Students turned and snickered at him, pointing and whispering and laughing and pulling out their phones. From somewhere behind him, Kyle could hear the sound of his own erotic moaning; someone was playing the video of him being fucked by Josh. How far had the video spread in this short time? Kyle&#39;s face burned. He had never been more embarrassed in his life. And yet, he couldn&#39;t deny that it made him feel incredibly sexy. He found himself smiling as he blushed<br />
<br />
Once he reached the bathroom, Kyle slammed the door behind him and ran to the mirror where another guy was washing up. It was Austin, an emo guy with jet black hair in his face, Kyle knew him from Science class. Standing next to Austin, Kyle examined himself in the mirror. He was a mess. His longish hair was matted with cum, and the changes to his body were slowly advancing. Through his thin shirt, Kyle could tell that his nipples had grown even more and faint mounds were forming behind them. Furthermore, his dick was getting hard again (to his bewilderment) and was clearly at least nine inches long. &quot;Well at least I&#39;ve got that going for me,&quot; he thought to himself before setting about washing himself off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Been busy again?&quot; Austin asked matter-of-factly as he dried off his hands.<br />
<br />
Kyle shrugged. &quot;Yea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well save some for me next time,&quot; Austin replied as he picked up his backpack to leave.<br />
<br />
At that point Austin paused and looked at Kyle expectantly. With a nod, Kyle bent over and presented his ass to the emo guy. Austin delivered a firm spank that made Kyle&#39;s head spin, and then the two of them made out for a while. Kyle particularly loved the way Austin&#39;s pierced tongue felt in his mouth. He would have to make out with more guys with piercings in the future. Soon Austin moved his hand down to Kyle&#39;s massive dick, grabbing it through is skinny jeans and pumping furiously. Finally, just when Kyle thought he would pass out from exhaustion, Austin slid his hand down Kyle&#39;s pants, grabbed his ass, and plunged a finger into his puckered hole. Kyle moaned loudly, achieving sweet release as a large wet spot spread in the leg of his pants. <br />
<br />
Austin left without a word for his next class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew,&quot; Kyle thought to himself as the door closed, &quot;that was almost really awkward.&quot; He returned to the mirror and finished cleaning himself off. There was no way his clothes and hair would dry before his next class but at least he was relatively clean. If only he had a towel, or perhaps a blow dryer. Yes, a blow dryer would have been nice. And perhaps some eye shadow or lip gloss. Unfortunately he&#39;d left his at home. What a shame!<br />
<br />
Kyle was interrupted from his thoughts by the sound of the tardy bell. He panicked, trying to remember what his next class was. It was so hard to think about anything other than his body, or Josh, or Austin, or his dream, but he had to. He couldn&#39;t be tardy. This was his last class of the day. He just had to finish this and then he was home free. &quot;Think, dammit...&quot; he muttered to himself, trying desperately to remember what his last class was...</p>
