<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A small smile spread across Ryomo&#39;s face as he supervised his army. Hinata&#39;s army was slowly making progress, methodically pushing back the formidable Dragon Army. Couple that with the continued artillery bombardment from the Rail Canons and the six tail kitsune could feel the tide of battle turning in his favor. With luck, he would have control of the capital by the time Hinata returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;General Ryomo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryomo turned, the grey kitsunes eyes going wide as he looked to where his soldier was pointing. Ryomo&#39;s right flanks was broken, the troops retreating towards the rear line. A thousand meters away, Ryomo could see Fukushu himself leading a counter attack. The nine tail locking eyes with Ryomo as he urged his soldiers to charge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adjust fire of the Rail Cannons,&quot; Ryomo ordered frantically. &quot;And target the advancing soldiers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;General?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do as I say,&quot; Ryomo exclaimed. &quot;Charge up the cannons and FIRE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly the soldiers saluted, ordering the artillery to change targets and fire at Fukushu&#39;s troops. As Ryomo watched his artillery adjust, he glanced at the rapidly approaching nine tail.<br />
<br />
Fukushu was in the lead of at least 100 kitsune warriors, their weapons held high as the let loose with a warriors yell. Fukushu looked to overwhelm Ryomo&#39;s position in a lightning blitz. Destroying the Rail Cannons and scattering the six tail kitsunes troops. &quot;Fire the Cannons!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryomo&#39;s soldiers now tried their best to recharge and aim their artillery. After firing a salvo, the Rail Cannons took a moment to recharge. Against a static target it would not be a problem. Against a mobile force though?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry,&quot; Ryomo ordered. Fukushu&#39;s forces had halved the distance, closing to within 500 meters. Ryomo could see Fukushu gripping his legendary katana, charging quickly towards Ryomo&#39;s position with a trio of cyborgs. Any of Hinata&#39;s troops that were in his path quickly cut down. If the Cannons didn&#39;t fire soon, all would be lost.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, they&#39;re ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;FIRE!&quot; Ryomo bellowed. A blistering salvo of light now rocketed towards Fukushu&#39;s troops, a massive explosion of light engulfing Fukushu&#39;s forces. Ryomo breathed a sigh of relief, this battle was over.<br />
<br />
Fukushu wheezed, his body wracked with pain as he lay face down. The explosion from the artillery had sent the nine tail sprawling. Fukushu&#39;s ears now rang, his hikama in tatters exposing half of his furry chest.<br />
<br />
Glancing around, Fukushu felt his heart sink. His troops, the kitsune he was leading were nothing more than charred skeletons; their blackened skulls frozen in an agonizing scream. Atlas, Arthur, and Murphy lay nearby. The cyber kitsune appeared de-activated, the blast having shut down their operating systems. Fukushu was alone.<br />
<br />
Grunting, Fukushu now began to search for his blade. Funs&#333; no shi, the Death of Conflict. This battle was not over, he would fight on. The kitsunes pride preventing him from failing. As he looked for his sword, his eyes went wide in shock as two ghostly figures presented it to him.<br />
<br />
Raiden, Fukushu&#39;s long dead brother and Akane, the eight tailed vixen who taught him the way of the warrior. Both ghosts now stood in front of Fukushu, presenting the kitsune with his weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get up brother.&quot; Raiden said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been in tougher spots.&quot; Akane added.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now took his blade, gripping it tightly as he willed himself into a kneeling position. Akane and Raiden now both seemed to whisper in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know who you are fighting for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Memories flashed through Fukushu&#39;s mind. A quiet moment with Abolith. The elf assassin gently touching his cheeks as she called him beloved.<br />
<br />
Kari. The stoic, black kitsune gazing at him. The quiet talks the pair would have. How she wished to prove herself to Fukushu.<br />
<br />
Haley. The jovial, intimidating kintaro tigress. The girl&#39;s laughter contagious. Her actions almost causing the usual stoic Fukushu to burst out in laughter.<br />
<br />
Aaron. The serious, awkward, shy young fox kintaro. The conversations the two would have. How Fukushu noted the boy&#39;s darker leanings, his insecurities. Fukushu trying to keep the young man from becoming just like him.<br />
<br />
Mason. A teenage boy that reminded Fukushu of the boy he once was. Mason, a boy who was earnest in his actions. Who just wanted to be accepted by his extended family.<br />
<br />
Fukushu grit his teeth rising to his feet. Gripping his blade tightly he could see Raiden and Akane standing by his side. The ghosts, urging him forward. To think of who he was fighting for.<br />
<br />
Two others now flashed in the nine tailed kitsune&#39;s mind. The first time he held his children. The love he thought he would never feel again. Raiden, the son he named in honor of his brother. The boy growing into a kind and gentle soul. A boy who Fukushu was incredibly proud of.<br />
<br />
Stella, his daughter. The elf girl adoring her father, wanting to be just like him. The daughter who made Fukushu rediscover his love of life. All of his family now flashed through Fukushu&#39;s mind. For them, he could not fail. For them, he was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.<br />
<br />
Fukushu&#39;s nine tails now fanned out behind him, a golden flame igniting from the tip of each tail. Fukushu now concentrated, feeling the presence of his brother and master by his side as the flames began to grow.<br />
<br />
Ryomo breathed a sigh of relief. Fukushu&#39;s attack force was devastated. Quickly the six tail General order his troops to advance, they would finish this fight now. Gazing out at the battlefield, the kitsune raised an eyebrow as Fukushu unsteadly rose to his feet. The famed general looked close to collapse. Ryomo chuckled, to think this would be how the famed Fukushu would meet his end.<br />
<br />
As Fukushu now stood, Ryomo could see the look of determination on his face. Obviously the kitsune would not go down without a fight. Perhaps, Ryomo would be the one to finally defeat him? As he now looked to advance, he could see the nine tailed kitsune stretch out his tails, a golden flame igniting on each of them. Those flames slowly growing in size.<br />
<br />
Fukushu locked eyes with Ryomo, the six tailed kitsunes eyes going wide in shock. Fukushu had no intention of going quietly. Quickly Ryomo ordered his artillery to reload, they needed to stop Fukushu quickly.<br />
<br />
Fukushu grit his teeth the flames from his tails growing, combining, becoming a sphere of golden flame that slowly began to engulf the battlefield. From within this sphere of flame, Fukushu was calm, his eyes locked with Ryomo as the six tail kitsune barked orders to his men. It mattered little to Fukushu, the sphere growing in size and power causing Ryomo to shield his face from the heat.<br />
<br />
With a mighty yell, Fukushu channeled his magical energy into a blast of destructive power. The flames exploding outwards, destroying anything and everything in it&#39;s wake.<br />
<br />
Fukushu felt at peace. The spell he cast exploding outwards, devastating his enemies. Fukushu, the Angel of Vengeance, the Death Fox, the Dark Samauri once more showed why he was the most feared kitsune warrior ever. For his people, for his family, Fukushu unleashed his incredible strength. Perhaps for the very last time.</p>
