<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Claire went inside to her bedroom to see her husband, Jeff shortly woke up from his sudden black out. Jeff doesn&#39;t know where he is and what has happened to him, He thought It was all a dream but then reality struck him as he realized that it was true, he is inside his mother&#39;s stomach! He can tell by the noises and voices outside the his chamber that it is his mother&#39;s voice talking to his dad! &#39;Wait a second&#39; he then realized, he now has all his senses! He can hear, see, smell, feel, and taste! It was great and all, but that was when the smell and taste got to him. He is starting to feel very sick where he is in currently, it smells like rotten cheese, tuna, sour milk, and other things he can&#39;t really describe. It&#39;s basically the smell and taste of vomit but more fetid! He tries to get his mother&#39;s attention but he can&#39;t talk nor move! His body is mixed in with the other contents inside his mother&#39;s sexy tummy. Inside fells extremely narrow, hot, wet, and tight. A sack filled with all the food she ate earlier providing her subsistence!<br />
<br />
Actually, it&#39;s not really anything new, your mother always ate a lot but at the same time always stays in perfect shape! It&#39;s very tight inside, you figure that your mother is currently bloated from all the food she has in her system. The digestive acids are sting him a little bit, but barely digesting him for nutrients. Sometimes when the family has a big meal after dinner you always see her toned belly get bloated sometimes. She gets digestive issues sometimes, her body digests food really slow when she ever gets bloated. When ever she notices her bloat, she works out a lot more than how she does regularly. Just to get her system going to digest what inside her to fuel and expel from her body. This is crazy! Is this what it&#39;s like being a meal inside your mother? It&#39;s only the beginning.<br />
<br />
Outside you hear what you parents are talking out... Your mom told your dad that nobody is home and Jeff left without any notice. Your mom and dad seem concerned, but at the same time shouldn&#39;t be all that worried. He is old enough to go alone to places and his friends house. He is the oldest in the family anyways, they think everything is fine. Though unaware that his mother devoured his son.<br />
<br />
You then heard a loud growling deep below you, a noise that came from her lower abdomen. A hard and solid pressure that wants to come out. Your mother feels something and needs to goto the bathroom FAST.<br />
<br />
You heard your mother telling your dad that she needs to use the restroom, and will be right back with him in 5 minutes to join him in bed. She is going to the restroom, but then Jeff questioned himself. He in currently in her stomach not her colon. You then thought that it&#39;s probably her meal from yesterday that is done and wanting to come out. Yesterday you remember that she ate pancakes in the morning, a rotary chicken and salad during lunch including a homemade blended banana and strawberry smoothie, and during dinner we had a lot of meatloaf and greens. This will be like a sneak peak on what you will soon become while hearing and feeling how your mother will relieve herself. All that food from the day before is done digesting and it&#39;s nutritional energy is now an extra part of your mothers defining figure.<br />
<br />
You then feel and hear your mother dashing to the bathroom. She arrived and closed the door and locking it behind her. You hear her taking some of her clothes off and feel your world move in a weird position as she sat on the toilet. Then you hear your mother take a big long nasty fart before her evacuation. Then a minute later the muscles in your world around you are swelling up, then squeezing you and the food contents extremely hard, god the pressure and immense! Claire is holding her lower abdomen, you hear outside that she is urinating. Emptying everything that is currently in her bladder, then you hear the pressure of the stream lowering and eventually stopped. She must be done peeing you thought to yourself being aroused in the current situation you in currently. Then Claire&#39;s asshole widen open, a long and wide rope of waste that was her food from yesterday slid out of her asshole. It came crashing down with big splash *THUMP* when it hit the toilet. The turd was about a foot long almost filling the whole bowl. After done releasing her waste monster, her the turd has made her asshole gape huge like a few inches, and then eventually closing back to it original cute button size. All the pressure and swelling has eventually eased out and stopped inside her body. Jeff now feels relieved that it was over. He just experienced what it&#39;s like being inside a unaware women while relieving themselves, that being your loving mother. Soon you will be that waste!<br />
<br />
When she was done panting after releasing her contents. She took a couple pieces of toilet paper and wipe herself. When she was done wiping and throwing some dirty paper in the bowl, you felt your world shift as she rises out of the toilet seat to inspect her work. You then hear her say &quot;Wow, this one was pretty big... hmm...&quot; She thought that this was one of this biggest shit she taken. But without any thought, you heard her flush down the contents which are now history. While she was done flushing she looked herself in the bathroom mirror to see if the bloating reduced. Jeff felt her hand(s) rub and applying pressure to food content including you. She notice there was no difference before using to the bathroom and after. Then Jeff heard her say to herself &quot;Hmmm.. no worries and I am gonna to work out a lot starting in the morning!&quot; Oh great! you thought to yourself! When she works out is when her digestive system starts going. The thought of it scares you, but at this point to too late! You are just food for her body to absorb. Maybe this was all worth it? You get to know your mother more from the inside a least! But at the cost of possibly dying.<br />
<br />
Jeff then heard her put her panties back on, grab her clothes, and leave the bathroom. You hear and feel her walking as she then went to the laundry room and threw her dress to the pile of other dirty clothes. After that she then again went back to her room in her underwear with her husband. While in the room she then puts on her nightgown, and then goes to bed with your dad. You hear her moving the bed sheets making herself comfortable and told her husband good night! They then went to sleep.<br />
<br />
*The next morning*<br />
<br />
While inside your mother&#39;s stomach you can&#39;t rest at all! You have been awake through out the whole night, while hearing your parents sleeping like angels. Hours had passed... It&#39;s morning you assume by hearing and feeling your mother getting up from bed. She got up, stretched, and started changing her clothes. She changed into her workout clothes, and dove out of the room while her husband was sleeping. While preparing herself by getting herself a water bottle, towels, etc. She decided that she would go outside for a jog first.</p>
