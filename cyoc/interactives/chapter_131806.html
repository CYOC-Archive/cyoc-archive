<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doctor Jones took a lot of his work as a therapist in Lyre very seriously and he always made sure to make time for those that came to him for help or were assigned to come to him for help, even when they didn&#39;t always feel they needed it. And that was the present case with Shyra, one of the present cases in which her conversion from Human to Animalian had resulted in her libido becoming excessively high, even for an Animalian. In many ways she liked it, and flat out admitted that she liked it and had swore that she was vaccinated and would never force herself on anyone, and hadn&#39;t forced herself on him during their sessions, Doctor Jones did have to remind her that that didn&#39;t actually count as not having a problem.<br />
<br />
Adult Animalians could be more frisky than normal Humans, especially those that were double dosed and had bond-mates. From the various counseling sessions in helping some Animalians that had had trouble finding mates or admitting that they liked someone, Doctor Jones did privately wonder if some of that was a way that Animalians expressed romantic love with each other, but then, he figured he&#39;d probably need a Sociologist to get the answer to that particular question, and that wasn&#39;t the main mission for the day. That mission was more help Shyra recognize where the appropriate limits of behavior were. He knew he couldn&#39;t lower her sex drive, that probably wouldn&#39;t change at all, but he could help her recognize that pushing things to the extreme wouldn&#39;t help her or those that she wanted to befriend.<br />
<br />
And that is what brought them outside the Mariana house and walking up the sidewalk toward their front door on a late Monday afternoon. School was out for the day, and the day did feel warmer. Much of the snow had melted way and things were getting more comfortable, but while that was nice, that wasn&#39;t the main reason he had brought Shyra there. That had more to do with the fact that Shyra seemed to be an extreme fan of Animalia Ambassadoria and had never wanted to make it seem like she wanted to sexualize a sixteen year old and compromise her father. In this, Doctor Jones recognized some of the issues that Shyra needed to overcome, particularly with remembering what was appropriate and what was not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... please remember to let ME do the talking to start with,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;I can understand wanting to make friends with Jessica and her family, as many Animalians of the same general species do tend to be friendly to each other in their own little communities within Animalia...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they aren&#39;t going to accept someone they think is &quot;morally deprived&quot; or some such nonsense,&quot; Shyra answered and looked down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say that... though that might not be too far from the truth,&quot; Doctor Jones answered and then reached forward to ring the doorbell.<br />
<br />
The bell rang in a soft chime and Doctor Jones waited patiently with eventually Jessica&#39;s father answering the door. He looked to Doctor Jones for a moment and then to Shyra who stood quietly behind the therapist.  At present the Holland Lop Eared Bunny was more appropriately dressed than when she&#39;d interrupted one of Jessica&#39;s driving lessons, in that she wore a plain tee-shirt and a pair of sweat pants. Admittedly they were rather tight to show her curves, but she did have more covered up this time. Jessica&#39;s father was a bit puzzled on this, as while Shyra would fit as a potential candidate to see Doctor Jones to get her head on straight, he didn&#39;t think that required coming to his home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Jones?&quot; Jessica&#39;s father spoke slowly, &quot;Is there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is it, dear?&quot; a female voice came from within the house, though too mature to be Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Doctor Jones... and one of his clients,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father called back to his wife and then looked back to Doctor Jones, &quot;Did your car break down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it still works,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;May we come in? There are some points in Shyra&#39;s therapy that I think that you and your family could be most helpful with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica&#39;s father raised an eyebrow as he heard his wife coming up behind him. In some ways he was glad to see Shyra getting therapy, as her essentially coming onto Jessica was totally inappropriate, even if there was nothing sexual in Shyra&#39;s intent. It was STILL in appropriate and he felt Shyra needed to understand that. However, that didn&#39;t mean he was qualified to be a therapist of any kind. He could give his opinion on right and wrong, but he couldn&#39;t give a clinical opinion. He then looked over his shoulder to his wife, who&#39;s eyes had narrowed when she saw Shyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I want the slut that hit on my daughter and my husband in MY house?&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hit on your daughter!&quot; Shyra answered, &quot;what I wanted was to be friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones turned and raised his hands and waved them up and down in a slow and calming motion to Shyra. She backed away for a moment and that allowed him to turn back to the Marianas, who were sure to want to defend their home and their daughter&#39;s honor. He gave a heavy sigh as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe there was a misunderstanding in the incident you&#39;re referring to,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;I have been working with Shyra to help her recognize where she was in error in that incident, but from what she has said to me, it seems as though she was looking for platonic friendship and didn&#39;t fully understand on how go about that. I think I am making progress with Shyra... but the REAL breakthrough is going to have depend on everyone working together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones paused to raise his pointer finger to his lips for a moment to think and then finished, &quot;In that honesty on your part would help Shyra recognize appropriate behavior and non-appropriate behavior and thus help her get control of her drives. If that leads to actual friendship between your family that will relate to how these go. I promise you that Shyra is vaccinated and that she will be on her BEST behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones looked over his shoulder to Shyra, who managed a smile. Jessica&#39;s parents watched her and then looked to each other for a few moments. They whispered to each other for a few moments and after a few moments Jessica&#39;s mother stepped back and her father held the door open for both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... we&#39;ll allow you to pitch your idea on being a sort of &quot;coach&quot; for her,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father spoke firmly, &quot;but she must accept that 1) we don&#39;t want to be Animalians and 2) our daughter doesn&#39;t get her second dose until she turns eighteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Shyra said after a few moments.<br />
<br />
With that Doctor Jones and Shyra were allowed entrance and they walked along. Shyra found herself most drawn to the pictures that were on the walls. They showed Jessica growing up, ranging from her first steps the most recent ones with her as an Animalian with Roger on one side and Sammy and Samantha on the other. All of the photos did show happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why did you not join Animalia?&quot; Shyra asked, &quot;it&#39;s obviously made your daughter happy. It&#39;s made me happy and made me young again. Wouldn&#39;t that be something you&#39;d want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone&#39;s path to happiness is the same,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother answered, &quot;and Jessica made her choice because she wanted to be there for her pet who was uplifted in the initial outbreak in town. That doesn&#39;t mean that she wasn&#39;t happy as a Human or that we are unhappy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ve been pretty content with our lives,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father added, &quot;We&#39;ve raised a good girl who has respected our rules and we love her very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Jessica&#39;s voice was heard as they were just getting settled into the living room, not knowing that Jessica and Roger were coming in through the back door. They&#39;d overheard some of the conversation between Shyra and Jessica&#39;s parents and Doctor Jones&#39;s attempts to moderate them and that had only served to spark curiosity. She&#39;d been with Roger and watching him go through one of his karate lessons after school and he&#39;d kindly walked her home, only to find that her family had company. Not only that but that her parents reaffirmed that they loved her, which of course Jessica knew. It was nice to hear it said, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad,&quot; Jessica spoke as she and Roger came in with Roger still in his training gi.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Roger wondered as he noticed Shyra seated on the couch with Doctor Jones and Jessica&#39;s parents settling into a pair of chairs that were by the front windows to the home. He became more nervous when Shyra looked to him in a way that reminded him a bit of how she looked at him and Jessica&#39;s father on Easter during Jessica&#39;s driving lesson.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what we&#39;re hoping to figure out,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mom spoke when she recovered from her surprise. She expected Jessica to return home some time after school and it wouldn&#39;t surprise her if Roger was with Jessica, but the fact that Doctor Jones had arrived with Shyra before they did had both of the Mariana parents on &quot;edge&quot; as it were.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is mostly to help further Shyra&#39;s sessions,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all here... as in a way what I think will do Shyra the most good will involve more than just me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But none of us are therapists,&quot; Jessica commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;True... and in terms of all clinical diagnosis, THAT will come from me,&quot; Doctor Jones nodded, &quot;but from the sessions I&#39;ve had with Shyra on her own... I would think that she looking to you as friends. She is a major fan of Animalia Ambassadoria... and THAT was what sparked the incident this past Easter. She didn&#39;t expect to see you there and thus got a bit excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t excuse trying to put my daughter&#39;s head in her cleavage, which she would have done if the window had been rolled down,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father pointed out, though he did note that Shyra looked down at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she is aware of that,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;as I said... what happened was more spontaneous excitement than any intent to come onto you, your daughter, or her bond-mate. Think of it like this... what would you do if you suddenly found yourself in front of your favorite sports hero or your favorite rock group. It doesn&#39;t matter who... are you going to say that you wouldn&#39;t be excited at such a situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica&#39;s father thought for a moment, and eventually sighed and nodded, &quot;I suppose...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you all know where the appropriate limits of behavior are, am I right?&quot; Doctor Jones asked as he glanced to Jessica&#39;s parents and to Jessica and Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is where you can help me with Shyra,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;and now, obviously ALL sessions with her will have to be confidential. This cannot go on Animalia Ambassadoria or any other media... at least with regard to the details discussed in all the sessions. As Shyra&#39;s sessions with you will still count as though they are sessions with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d still request that you be there for these sessions,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father spoke, &quot;Just to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m more than willing to help,&quot; Doctor Jones nodded, &quot;the point is to keep these things confidential. If Shyra wishes to report them to the press, that is her business at it is HER privacy that she&#39;s dealing with. As people trying to help her, we can&#39;t take that from her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica&#39;s parents traded glances but eventually nodded. They had their concerns about Shyra, particularly in relation to her practically coming onto Jessica the past Easter, but so far things hadn&#39;t gone too bad. Sure, the clothing Shyra was wearing looked tight, but it was more modest than what was described in the confrontation at Easter. Her feet were clean and thus hadn&#39;t gotten anything muddy on the carpet. In that, they figured that if this was to help Doctor Jones help Shyra, they could go along with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we can be friends and learn from each other,&quot; Shyra said smiling and clapping her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t want our daughter stripping,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother said first.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM!&quot; Jessica gasped, more at the mention of it than anything else. While she could feel all the hormones related to puberty and growing up going through her that often had her fantasizing more about Roger than she&#39;d ever admit to her parents, that didn&#39;t mean she wanted a job at the Meat Market when she grew up. She wasn&#39;t one hundred percent sure what she wanted to be when she graduated college, but serving drinks and dancing at a strip club wasn&#39;t one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Shyra knows that,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;and any &quot;lessons&quot; given will have yours and Roger&#39;s supervision and approval as well as with mine... as the POINT of the exercise is ultimately to help Shyra recognize where the limits are without testing them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father said firmness and a focus on Shyra that was intended to make it absolutely clear that he wasn&#39;t going to let Shyra corrupt his only daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, at the same time,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;this also ISN&#39;T to be some kind of lesson in absolute morality and abstention... Sex is very much a part of human nature and humans are drawn to it. It&#39;s why women in comic books, particularly main characters and main supporting characters are a D cup or larger with a perfect hourglass figure. It&#39;s why men in comic books are often portrayed as the perfect human athlete. In fact a lot of what went into Wonder Woman in that series early run was that there was a certain amount of sexual deviancy that was there... and that&#39;s WELL before Animalia even came around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... we&#39;ve gone beyond that,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father protested, &quot;recognized that there is a time and a place for it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Recognizing a time and place for it is one thing,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;but if you look into old sitcoms and other media that was often trying to teach a &quot;moral lesson&quot; to people, there is no recognition of a time and place for it. Their end message is to deny it completely... and the often sold it very well. A lot of it you can trace back into the start of the Catholic Church as an official institution. While they don&#39;t forbid followers from having sex, all people who join the Church DO take vows of chastity. And it&#39;s that sort of thing that has given the Catholic Church a LOT of trouble over the years as they often denied what is essentially a part of human nature, and why when the Protestant Churches began to form after 1517 that such vows were NOT part of the Protestant faith. It&#39;s more a recognition and acceptance of human nature rather than denying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that isn&#39;t to justify going to the other extreme,&quot; Jessica&#39;s mother pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Doctor Jones nodded, &quot;In a way... it&#39;s best to find a happy middle, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going for here.&quot;</p>
