<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jason fiddled with the door handle, Donny tried his best to evade Tiara. She was quick though and cornered him between Danielle and the elevated stage. She pushed him back onto the booth seating with arms that were way too strong for comfort and undid his button and zipper with a lick of her lips.<br />
<br />
Once his cock was free she plunged it into her mouth and he couldn’t do anything but moan and try his best to resist cumming. But hey, you try to resist a sexy ass stripper running her tongue around your cock. When he withheld she grinned and added her breasts to the equation.<br />
<br />
Soft milky breasts engulfing his dick? Yeah there was no chance. Donny let out a stream of cum into her face in seconds, and she eagerly lapped up part of the stream. Some of his jizz got on her tongue and within seconds changes had begun.<br />
<br />
His shoes turned black and grew a slight heel while his socks crept up his legs as dark fishnets. Those shoes followed until he had a pair of boots on that rose to his knees. His pants merged with his shirt and rose up his body, spreading out into a skirt until his underwear was visible, pulled down from the blowjob and quickly becoming purple with a little white skull on the front. His shirt and skirt merged and the texture began to change. Long purple and black sleeves formed covered alongside a short ruffled black dress and a corset settling atop it. His neckline lowered until you could see his hairy chest and a pitch black choker appeared on his neck.<br />
<br />
“Wha?” Donny asked while grabbing at his clothes. Seconds later his eyes rolled back as his dick rocketed backwards into his body making her drool and grow a look of ecstasy on her face.<br />
<br />
She shrunk after that, getting smaller and daintier with her shoulders caving inwards and waist growing small and tightly bound in that corset. Her legs grew shapely and feminine, her feet shrunk, and her skin grew pale and pasty. Black nail polish drew on her toenails and fingernails and her entire face slimmed down and grew feminine. Her nose shrunk, her eyes changed shape, and her jawline became cute and petite. Makeup then appeared on her face and darkness began to cloud around her eyes. Those eyes turned a beautiful stormy gray and piercings erupted on her ears, nose, lip, and eyebrow. A stud appeared on her stomach while pitch black tattoos began to crawl into existence under her outfit.<br />
<br />
Her hair sprang out in carefully managed pitch black locks that flooded down her back. She shuddered as it settled to its final length and the final change took place.<br />
<br />
Her shirt was rather loose but two mounds began to slowly rise from her chest, expanding outwards into beautifully sized globes with round pink nipples expanding with them. Donny panted and each breath seemed to take those breasts out a little further until they were big enough to wrap around a penis and give a nice titjob like the former Donny had just received.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, looks like Donna isn’t as straight as she thought,” Danielle cooed.<br />
<br />
“Might want to update your social media to say bisexual,” Frankie teased.<br />
<br />
“Shu-shut up you guys,” Donny moaned, no she was Donna, yeah that was right. She’d just had a stripper digging around in her vagina with her tongue, that would have aroused anyone. She could feel her overwhelming attraction to girls fading, she liked boobjobs still but she could fee a growing sense that she liked giving them instead of receiving them.<br />
<br />
That wasn’t right, something wasn’t right. She was Donna, no she was Donna. She was Donna? Boobjobs? How was she supposed to receive one? No she’d given them before. Wait but she didn’t have tits. No wait, of course she did, they were right there on her chest. Two luscious orbs that she grabbed at and fondled. Oh she’d loved when they’d first gotten big enough to wrap around the thick cock of a man. Memories flooded her and she smiled at that thought.<br />
<br />
A new existence began to cloud her mind, she felt a growing love for books, Donny hated them but who the fuck was Donny? She was Donna and she could power through a novel in an evening if the mood hit her. Nothing beat a quiet evening surrounded by scented candles drinking her favourite tea with her nose in a book. She liked books so much she wanted to be an author one day, but until she could make it big with her poetry and novels she’d study the stupid education degree her parents wanted. English literature was an interest of hers. She had so many favourite authors who wrote about the human mind, horror, and the flighting sensation of human existence.<br />
<br />
Oh she was a bookish goth all right and wanted to write the same soul touching themes her inspirations wrote about. Dystopias and science fiction horror, the horrible existence of an intelligent female mind trapped in the role of a housewife. That was why she loved Meredith Ringer so much. Her novel about a brilliant mind rotting away inspired her to pursue her passion of writing.<br />
<br />
“There,” she sighed once her mind had settled. “I got eaten out by the stripper, happy?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, you should’ve seen your face, I’ve never seen you so happy,” Frankie grinned.<br />
<br />
“I’m happy with my books,” Donna argued while moving some stray hairs from her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Those don’t count,” Frankie laughed while Donna glowered at her.<br />
<br />
Jason meanwhile continued to struggle with the door and shrieked when Tiara grabbed his shoulder and spun him around, pressing him against the door.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want to join your friends?” She asked with a lick of her lips while Jason cowered before her.</p>
