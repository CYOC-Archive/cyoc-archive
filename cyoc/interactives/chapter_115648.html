<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning in the Anderson house began much the way it had been since the issues with Yvette Smith&#39;s time on the loose had ended. William and Martha were both weres, a werefox and werecat respectively, and that transition had assured that the background issues that gave them trouble were healed. Both Anderson parents woke up to find themselves cuddled in bed and feeling the softness of each other&#39;s fur softly rubbing against each other. Eric awoke with a nice smile. He was the last of his family to join were society, but memories of his shared dreams with Julie was enough to let him feel perfectly happy anyway. She was a beautiful young mermaid who not only transformed him, but made him happy and had gave him confidence to really integrate into Moon Lake high school. Not every student might be as good at science as he was, but no one seemed to be too hung up on it and were friendly with him and Julie made him happy. To Eric, that was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
Nate was the last to get up and he found his thoughts returning to what he&#39;d found himself dwelling on when he&#39;d gotten up for a midnight snack. Unfortunately sleeping through the night and getting his turn in the bathroom to shower and ready for the day didn&#39;t bring any new ideas for Nate to come up with. His thoughts were for the moment interrupted when he heard a sharp knock on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Nate... mom says to hurry up or you&#39;ll be late for school,&quot; Eric called to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing fine,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;I got all my clothes in with me and so on. I&#39;m actually not to far from being done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... but it is 7:15,&quot; Eric reminded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Nate answered and pushed the water faucet off and was soon drying himself off and rushing to get ready for breakfast.<br />
<br />
He did make it down with enough time to join his parents and younger brother for breakfast. He found both them discussing many of the things that did seem to loom over the family and their new home town in Moon Lake. It related to the threats the Skulk, the werefoxes of Moon Lake that his parents had joined though his mother only as an honorary member, felt was coming through Dieter Wilhelm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hope that things are calmer today,&quot; Martha said to no one and mostly speaking her mind, &quot;Yesterday was too hectic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; William nodded and rubbed Martha&#39;s shoulders before moving to sit down, &quot;but with the agent caught and cooperating... things should get better... especially with the wedding coming up soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate noted that both his mother and younger brother nodded to that, but something in the back of his mind still wondered if there wasn&#39;t something more they could do. Though for the moment, Nate kept his thoughts to himself as he ate his breakfast. He commented on hos his night went and so on, but didn&#39;t quite voice what his thoughts were on as too much of it was more with Ben and Alex as they might be more knowledgeable with regard to his exact thoughts. After breakfast, Nate and Eric both went out, as it would be time to go out to school. Eric was quick to jog off toward the bus stop, where Nate assumed he&#39;d meet up with Julie. He smiled after his brother and stepped out onto the grass toward the Twist home next door. He paid little notice to his father heading out on foot for the college and soon after his mother driving off for the Middle School as he had his mission.<br />
<br />
He arrived on the Twist driveway just as Ben came out. His neighbor and best friend, outside of Alex, in Moon Lake looked to him and then toward the Anderson home.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Eric today?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s apparently riding the bus to school today,&quot; Nate answered and pointed down the street, to where Eric could be seen kissing Julie underneath a metal sign that read &quot;School Bus Stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Ben commented, &quot;then all we have to do is pick up Alex then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded and climbed into the passenger seat. As he bulked himself in, he began to voice his thoughts to Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did your parents talk about any of the stuff that went on yesterday?&quot; Nate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... but not to me,&quot; Ben answered, briefly remembering his dancing with Kenya, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve just been thinking over all these problems that this Dieter Wilhelm has been causing,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;In a way... well more than what Yvette Smith did while on the run.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... he got the whole school district into lock-down with an attempted murder yesterday,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;and even if his target is a werefox... the thing that he&#39;s doing will only cause trouble for everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again Ben nodded. Frances didn&#39;t talk much about her work with Jenny as there was much that had to be kept confidential between physician and patient, but Ben did know that there was a lot of tension over the Jenkins/Harper wedding and that Moon Lake&#39;s werefoxes wanted it to succeed. He&#39;d even talked to a few of the werefoxes at school from time to time. They all wanted to make Jenny happy and so on. The fact that this shadow loomed over them likely put stress on them just as much as they did on Jenny and Harry. It&#39;d then surely make for major problems given things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s rough,&quot; Ben commented as he drove along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I was thinking,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;Do you think there is any more we could do? Talk to Austin or his son about the pack offering additional help... or organizing something along civic lines to assist the police keep this guy out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben blinked, &quot;Well... the pack could offer help... but a lot of that would also need cooperation with the city government and the Skulk would surely wish to remain in charge of the overall operation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously,&quot; Nate nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;d take some time,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;Austin and his wife would have to agree... and they have a family to consider as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for a more civic minded idea,&quot; Ben continued, &quot;the closest thing would be a voluntary Were Alert. Everyone who wishes to reports to the police assigned to the guard the wedding and go from there. I could talk to my mom about that as an option for any who wish to help... but that&#39;d still mean that they&#39;d need volunteers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate didn&#39;t look up, though he could feel the car&#39;s momentum take a sharp turn as Ben pulled into the Ramsey driveway to wait for Alex to come out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just feel like there is more all of us could do for her... she does deserve to be happy,&quot; Nate said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things aren&#39;t easy and never are,&quot; Ben sighed, &quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t tell you anything more than that right now.&quot;</p>
