<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their encounter with Freed&#39;s family, he offered to show Mai around the village to which she eagerly agreed. Mai was surprised to see a mostly human village living alongside, and inside for that matter, these incredibly tall trees. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why weren&#39;t these trees simply cut down and houses built with the wood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These trees are some of the sturdiest buildings in all of Orderon. They are called Ironbark trees for a reason after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really racked their minds trying to think of a village name didn&#39;t they,&quot; Mai smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ha ha, haven&#39;t heard that before,&quot; Freed rolled his eyes and continued to lead the way. &quot;Anyway, we limit ourselves to only cut down a hand full of trees a year, both to prevent severe damage to the area, and to keep prices high for the wood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this used for if you only fell a few a year?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shields, bows, staffs, doors sometimes, things like that,&quot; Freed listed each item off on a finger. &quot;Basically anything that you want to be durable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even houses,&quot; she asked, imagining a house that could withstand almost any disaster.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could, but the price would probably cost more than a small castle,&quot; he shrugged.<br />
<br />
They reached the edge of the ironbark forest and the logging camp where felled trees were moved to be converted into more manageable sizes. Before them was a large camp with a river running next to it. The water from the river turned a large waterwheel that, when a lever was pulled, would turn the series of saws. Presently a group of men and oxen were trying to pull a section on log wider than Mai was tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! We&#39;re just in time to see them pull a section up. They have to cut it into smaller sizes just to drag them back here. This one looks like a 12 ax.&quot; He noticed Mai&#39;s confused look. &quot;That means how many axes would be dulled before the tree falls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twelve axes just to knock it over?! How can your people afford that price?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the old days, before we got smarter. Now we trade with dwarf makers for enchanted axes that cut easier and hold their edge better.&quot; He saw how the men were struggling to get it over the last hill. &quot;Wait here, I&#39;m going to see if they want my help.&quot; Freed ran off to the group who had stopped to catch their breath.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing the diminutive looking half-elf, one of their number yelled out to him. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing here? This is no place for someone like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you struggling and wanted to offer my help,&quot; Freed said sincerely, well aware of the raised eyebrows and looks of annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have time for this kid. Get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye, ma back is &#39;urtin&#39; nough without yew addin a &#39;eadache,&quot; the comments raised a few to laughing and whispering rude comments to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mebbe he thinks he can doit by &#39;imself,&quot; one jeered.<br />
<br />
Despite not inheriting his family&#39;s stature, Freed did have their sense of pride and could not turn away from people that looked down at him. He folded his arms across his chest and glared. &quot;Aye, I can,&quot; his voice dipping back to his old accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really,&quot; a large man stepped forward, his dark skin covered in sweat, &quot;this I must see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll move all of them,&quot; he pointed down the hill at the now visible remaining sections that had yet to be brought up. &quot;But what do I get for this bet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha! You move them and I&#39;ll pay you 50 gold,&quot; the challenger offered, this drawing murmurs from the others about a month&#39;s pay.<br />
<br />
Freed pulled out a purse and showed his gold. &quot;Deal. Now stand back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my lord,&quot; the man mockingly bowed and they moved off. Mai walked up to join the group of onlookers and heard some wondering if the boy was going to hurt himself and if they were going to be held responsible.<br />
<br />
Freed raised his hands and let out a long slow breath before he inhaled and began the incantation, his hands moving sharply and deliberately with each syllable. As his hands began to glow, Mai heard one of the group look at the dark skinned man and say, &quot;say goodbye to your pay Nathan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off! No way he can do it. He&#39;s just...a...boy,&quot; the conviction drained from Nathan&#39;s voice as he watched the huge log lifted off the ground slowly and glided towards the saw blades and came to a rest next to the other logs the group had dragged up. Followed soon enough behind the first log was the remaining 8 sections that would have taken the group at least another 3 days to move. Through all this, Freed never broke his concentration and only stopped his chanting when the last log came to a rest on the ground. <br />
<br />
Sighing, Freed took a moment to look at his binding ribbons on his arm and saw that they had only gone just below his wrist. &#39;That took less mana than I thought it would. Maybe I am getting better at pacing myself. I&#39;ll have to thank Gabriel when I see him next time for the exercises.&#39;<br />
<br />
He looked at the stunned group of onlookers. &quot;Well, I believe I am owed some money.&quot;<br />
<br />
His mouth agape, Nathan handed him a coinpurse, &quot;I&#39;ll have the rest next week,&quot; he never took his eyes off the pile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am in no rush. Have a nice day off,&quot; Freed walked off, a spring in his step, Mai following close behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be judging you by your size anymore,&quot; Mai laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That felt good. Maybe if this hero thing doesn&#39;t work for me, I can help out with the logging.&quot; The pair laughed as they continued their tour.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; said Freed as the pair stood outside the gates of the castle on the hill.<br />
<br />
&quot;This...is your home,&quot; Mai said dumbstruck.<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your family doesn&#39;t seem very...,&quot; She paused as she searched for the right words without sounding rude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noble? High born?&quot; He smiled. &quot;Uptight?&quot; Mai nodded. &quot;Years before me or my siblings were born, a small army of <br />
ogres threatened the village. Mother and father were able to unite the surrounding clans together into a force to oppose them. After we won, they got married and this place was given to them for their roll as the village saviors. After you,&quot; he bowed and offered her to lead once the gate opened on its own.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you. Your home, you lead.&quot; <br />
<br />
Freed shrugged and started off towards the looming castle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like something from a storybook almost,&quot; Mai began. &quot;Seems like they got a good deal.&quot; <br />
<br />
Freed shook his head and laughed, &quot;They thought so too until everyone told them they were the &#39;duly appointed regional governors&#39;. They didn&#39;t like that.&quot; They reached the heavy doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t they quit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well because...&quot; The doors opened and Freed&#39;s mother stood in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our &#39;ome,&quot; she said surprisingly cheerily given their last meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-help mother,&quot; Freed stammered, his head bowed slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freed,&quot; she said flatly and then looked at Mai, &quot;we were nev&#39;r formally introduced. Ah am Isla Gornhilde.&quot; She extended her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mai Brightwing,&quot; she took the offered hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mai Brightwing...that&#39;s a pixie name innit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I am uh, was a pixie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah am sure tha&#39; there&#39;s a story to tha&#39;. But for now dinner. Come.&quot; She turned on her heel and lead the pair into the castle. <br />
<br />
The decorations that adorned the walls varied from paintings and tapestries to hunting trophies. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does your family pay for all of this,&quot; Mai asked in wonderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our family, bein&#39; tha&#39; governors, take a small percent of tha&#39; profit from tha&#39; loggin&#39; sales. &#39;ere we are.&quot; They turned the corner and were brought into the dining room. Seated at the table trading jokes and stories were the rest of Freed&#39;s family.<br />
<br />
&#39;I am definitely not ready for this,&#39; Freed mentally groaned.</p>
