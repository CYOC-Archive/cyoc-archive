<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Avery left the apartment, excited to see the notebook potentially work it’s magic. Since it was a thank you gift from Yu and Skylar, Avery had a feeling it had a few tricks it would play on them. However, the only thing they didn’t want to do was disrupt Tonya at work.<br />
<br />
As Avery arrived onto the somewhat busy city street, they felt something. The first change.<br />
Through their tan sweater, Avery caught their nipples hardening… clearly protruding through the sweater. Just the thought of it made them excited. And who knows, maybe Tonya would be into it!<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Tonya guided a new group of art enthusiasts around the most recent exhibit. Since it had been there for a month, Tonya knew all there was to know about it! She quipped fact after fact, even noting some of the meanings behind the artist, as well as some of her own interpretations. As usual, the tour group was impressed; amazed mostly by her passion for the subject of art.<br />
“Are you an artist yourself?” An older woman asked from the crowd. She had short grey hair, wearing a rather youthful top and a skirt. If anything, Tonya could’ve thought she was an artist herself,<br />
“I’d like to call myself one!” She chuckled, the group seemed to chuckle along with her, “but I haven’t got any art in the gallery.”<br />
“Not yet!” Another group member called out, the rest of the group chuckled again. Tonya chuckled herself. She felt quite inspired, a little proud that a group would consider her; no, assume her an artist. She chuckled to herself.<br />
Tonya cleared her throat, “now!” She started, “if you will follow me to the next exhibit…” she stated as she made her way past her colleague. They gave each other a smile before they continued on.<br />
<br />
Tonya finished speaking for this area. The group had split off for a few minutes to absorb the art around them. She stood to herself, personally taking in a few of the artworks for herself.<br />
“I must say; I’m impressed.” A somewhat French voice spoke from behind. Tonya turned calmly to face them with a smile on her face… but it wasn’t someone on the current tour. It was…<br />
“Beaumont.” He said, holding out his hand. Tonya’s eyes widened, she panicked before quickly grabbing it,<br />
“Hi!” She awkwardly said, a wide grin appearing on her face, “w-what are you impressed by?” She asked, looking around at the art,<br />
“Yourself.” He said. Tonya looked back at him, “your passion for art really shows. I think it must be a gift.”<br />
“Hah…” Tonya chuckled awkwardly, “y’know my partner says that.”<br />
“I’m sure he does.”<br />
“They.” Tonya corrected. She quickly covered her mouth, realising she’d been so rude to such a prolific artist,<br />
“My apologies.” He said, nodding respectfully, “I do too consider my identity a canvas.” He said, laughing to himself, “I have much respect for your partner. And again, I apologise.”<br />
“It’s okay… really!” Tonya said,<br />
“I must ask, you are an artist?”<br />
“Y-yeah! I mean… I don’t have a lot of time for art,” she chuckled, “but it’s my passion.”<br />
“I mean, you surround yourself self with art; with artists! Of course.” He says.<br />
Oddly, despite such a profound and sensitive topic, with someone Tonya could easily say she respected. She found him staring at her chest… not something new to her,<br />
“Oh uhm…” she said awkwardly, adjusting her top. She wore a modest top today… yet… wait.<br />
<br />
Tonya looked down, catching the familiar glance of her cleavage… as well as something else.<br />
She didn’t want to stare too long, however, there was an odd hair. A chest hair?<br />
“Would you mind giving me just a moment?” Tonya asked,<br />
“Of course.” Beaumont said, smiling sincerely. He even looked a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Tonya quickly left the room, headed to the back room whereupon she found an art piece that featured a mirror. She stared at herself, quickly checking around her before pulling down her top to show off her chest.<br />
There it was. A single, stray chest hair.<br />
She touched it, seeing it wiggle a little, clearly attached to her chest. She put her nails onto it, able to pull at it, stretching her skin a little. She even chuckled a little at the peculiar situation.<br />
But considering she had a tour to guide, she didn’t have time to mess around. It was odd, but not odd enough to cause alarm. Tonya pinched the hair, and with one swift pull she yanked it off.<br />
“Gone.” She said to herself, brushing herself off.<br />
She readjusted her top and made her way back into the gallery.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Avery started their walk. Miraculously, as they walked they quickly bumped into an old friend, someone from way back in High-School.<br />
They chatted for a while, and causally slipped in their identity change. The friend seemed rather supportive, even commenting that they appeared a little more feminine than they remembered.<br />
That was nice, especially considering Avery hadn’t done much in terms of makeup today.<br />
They parted and said farewell and Avery went on their way. As they walked, they found themself oddly swaying. Looking down, she noted that their somewhat prominent bulge was a little… lacklustre.<br />
Not necessarily a bad thing, but unusual.<br />
As they continued looking down however, they noticed something else… everything seemed a little… bigger?<br />
They were right, they were shrinking! Not by much, but enough to be noticeable. They had miraculously lost about six or so inches in height.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Tonya returned to the tour, where Beaumont had clearly taken the crowd with ease. What warmed Tonya’s heart was that when she arrived, the group’s faces seemed to light up! She smiled, “ready to move on?<br />
Everyone unanimously nodded in agreement.<br />
Tonya smiled and said her goodbye to Beaumont, however they weren’t quite done. “After your tour, I’ll be around. I’d love to speak with you some more.”<br />
<br />
Tonya continued the tour, once again enriching, entertaining, and enlightening the group with her knowledge and love of art.<br />
As she finally got to the end of the tour, the group began to applaud her. She’d had some claps here and there, but right now… this really felt amazing.<br />
She thanked everyone for coming, and even when offered some money she refused.<br />
After the group dispersed and Tonya was tapped on the shoulder. A part of her was expecting Beaumont to be behind her, but instead she was greeted by an older woman. She had dark skin, dark grey hair, and wore somewhat muted clothing, she wasn’t particularly colourful, but her eyes happened to be two different colours, green and purple…<br />
“Show me your hands…” she asked. Tonya looked a little puzzled, she awkwardly chuckled, “do it.”<br />
Tonya complied. She showed off her two hands, each with painted red nails and a smile silver engagement ring. The old woman huffed, Tonya felt oddly offended despite her confusion, “excuse me?” She asked,<br />
“Perhaps it was my imagination… I sensed something about you.”<br />
“What about me?” Tonya pried,<br />
“Magic. You aren’t unfamiliar with magic are you?”<br />
“Uhm…” Tonya felt awkward, perhaps getting a little too personal, “I guess.”<br />
“Well your little friend says otherwise.” The old woman chuckled, she waved her hand and began to walk away. Tonya wanted to push her further, to understand why she wanted to see her hands… but she felt a tightness… in her crotch.<br />
<br />
Tonya looked down, leaning down past her bust to glance at her groin. There was… a bulge!<br />
“Oh fuck…” she whispered, quickly checking around herself. A few of her colleagues were speaking with their own tours, and Beaumont was speaking with Miss Dean. She had to get to the bathroom quickly!<br />
<br />
Past the back room, she found the bathroom. She couldn’t risk anyone coming in, so she locked the door, surrounded by a number of cubicles and a set of sinks below a long mirror.<br />
She looked at her reflection… her bulge, it was undeniably there. And it looked like it was twitching a little.<br />
She took a deep breath before pulling down her pants, revealing her panties. She took another breath before revealing what she hoped was just her own vagina… but nope.<br />
“Fuck!” She said to herself, looking right into the eye of a penis. It wasn’t big, in fact it was rather small. But just as she was staring at it, she felt a surge of pleasure running down her veins, right into her new cock.<br />
It suddenly grew larger, thicker and longer, stretching at least three inches bigger. Just from the pleasure, it began to harden. Her appendage began to lift, higher and higher before it stood half-mast just underneath her belly. She was truly in awe… what had happened. Had she been cursed?<br />
“Oh my god…” she said, noticing a small pair of balls beneath it. They sat right where vagina had once been, now dangling, touching the sides of her thighs.<br />
A familiar surge, this time going lower. Those balls immediately began to swell, like being pumped full of rich creamy liquid, they grew like balloons. They swells from the size of grapes to the size of small eggs. Her cock grew again, becoming longer and thicker once more. It now sat at an average six inches.<br />
Tonya could only really stand there, staring at it, pulsating slowly. It was veiny, pumping blood through it. She could feel it.<br />
The thing that was beginning to frustrate Tonya was that if this wasn’t her own penis, she’d probably find it quite hot. But it absolutely wasn’t… despite just how hard she was.<br />
<br />
“Tonya?” Amelie asked through the door. Tonya almost screamed, she blurted out,<br />
“Y-yeah sorry!”<br />
“It’s fine, just checking on you?”<br />
“I’m okay… just dealing with… stuff.” She said awkwardly, now trying to figure out what to do. She instinctively put her hand on her penis, which gave her an unfamiliar sensation. With a slight tinge of pleasure, she tried to push it back down, but of course it sprung back up.<br />
“Okaaaay, just don’t take too long. You know how Miss Dean is.” Amelie said, her footsteps apparent as she walked away from the door.<br />
Tonya bent down and grabbed her phone from her pocket, she quickly googled ‘tucking’, and did her best to conceal her new manhood.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Avery sat in a coffee shop, their breasts had started to develop… and quickly. Just as they were drinking their coffee, it was like the liquid ran straight into their breasts. One cup size, then another, and another. Before long, they were easily DD’s.<br />
Their chair began to feel a little tighter, as well as their pants. Their ass started growing, getting bigger fatter, their hips widening a little more, their thighs expanding too.<br />
They awaited their penis to eventually shrink and disappear, but it didn’t seem like that was going to happen.<br />
“Excuse me Miss— uhm Sir… I mean…” the waitress stuttered, taking in Avery’s face, then their chest and ass, “I’m sorry!” The waitress said, unsure of what to think,<br />
“It’s okay, I’ll just take another coffee.” They said, their voice somewhat higher in pitch. The waitress nodded and walked away.<br />
<br />
“Hm.” Avery said. They reached into their bag and pulled out the notebook, “let’s not limit this to just being a woman, I want to experience being different in all ways!”<br />
They scribbled their wish into the notebook, and almost immediately they let out a moan.<br />
Strangely, the only thing that seemed to immediately change was their facial hair turning from smooth and freshly shaven, to quickly getting thicker and bushier. After even just a few moments, their beard was full and fluffy. Not to mention how odd it appeared on their busty body.<br />
Finally, they found their cock beginning to swell. Of course, being a public place they didn’t reveal it, but just the feeling of it swelling was enough to make Avery shudder.<br />
<br />
“Your coffee?” The waitress said, her eyes suddenly widening upon seeing the patron has miraculously grown a full beard. She stood there, feeling as if she couldn’t move!<br />
“You want me to explain it?” Avery said with a smirk.</p>
