<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the end, it didn't take Ben too long to decide on the kind of change he wanted. He clicked on the button next to the “Increase Muscles” option, and a new window appeared on the screen. In this window, there were two buttons, one called “Simple Adjustment”, the other “Custom”. Ben felt that he wasn’t up to any complicated procedures just yet, so he clicked on the “Simple Adjustment” button. A new page opened, and again there were two different buttons.
<br />

<br />
[] Start Increase
<br />
[] Stop Increase
<br />

<br />
This looked easy enough, so Ben decided to give it a try. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes for a while, opened them again and hit the “Start Increase” button.
<br />

<br />
At first, Ben didn’t feel anything at all. Then he began to notice a tingling sensation in his stomach, which quickly spread across his whole body. After a while, the tingling ceased, and Ben noticed a strange noise that sounded a bit like two balloons gently rubbing against each other. Also, Ben could feel an increasing tension in all the muscles of his body, as if he was giving them all an intense workout. He was still only sitting in front of his notebook, however, and had not even moved since hitting the “Start Increase” button on the screen. The tension was still increasing, though, and the noise had built up a bit and consisted of little cracking and crunching sounds as well.
<br />

<br />
When Ben looked down at his body, he couldn’t see any difference to the way he had always looked, but he certainly felt different. He pulled his shirt out of his pants and up a bit in order to take a look at his stomach, and what he saw immediately gave him a hard-on. His abs were clearly visible, and with each little crunching sound, they became more defined. Ben pulled his shirt further up and looked at his pecs. They, too, were much more pronounced than they had been before, and with each crack, with each crunch, they became bigger and fuller, as if they were being blown up by some invisible force. 
<br />

<br />
Ben reluctantly let his shirt slip back down, and his slowly growing pecs and abs were covered again. He pulled back the sleeve on his right arm next and examined his forearm and his new, increasingly muscular upper arm. He flexed his arm and felt the bulge of his biceps with his left hand. He kept the hand on his biceps, enjoying the fact that the bulge on his arm was getting bigger and bigger with each crack, with each little crunch.
<br />

<br />
It seemed to Ben, though, that the real growth hadn’t even started yet, and sure enough he soon noticed another wave of the tingling sensation he had felt right after hitting the “Increase” button washing over him. The crunching and cracking got a bit louder still, and he could feel the new energy rushing through his body. The fact that his arms were being slowly pushed away from his body told him that his lats must have started growing, and the tightness of his pants made it clear that his quads were swelling as well. 
<br />

<br />
Ben leant back to enjoy the feeling of his increasing muscularity. His pecs had become so big in the meantime that he could see them through his shirt, which was getting tighter and tighter, trying to cope with his expanding lats, his bulging shoulders, and the growing amount of back muscle it had to contain. The sleeves of his shirt, too, were beginning to have trouble dealing with the combined and steadily rising forces of his biceps and triceps. Ben started to touch himself, exploring his changing body, and feeling more and more aroused by the second. 
<br />

<br />
Suddenly, he couldn’t take it anymore, he wanted to see his new muscles, he wanted to watch the changes his body was going through. He remembered that he had come into his bedroom before he started the change because there was a full-length mirror in here. He jumped up from his chair, intending to start posing in front of the mirror right away, but he moved so impetuously that he bumped against the desk in front of him. A few minutes ago, nothing extraordinary would have happened, but now, with his dramatically increased strength, Ben broke the desk in two, sending the notebook which had been standing on top of the desk flying across the room. It landed next to his bed, and the screen went blank.
<br />

<br />
At first, Ben felt like laughing at his clumsiness, but then he suddenly remembered that he had to press the “Stop Increase” button if he wanted the growth of his muscles to stop. Ben took a while to process this information and to figure out all its implications. When he finally grasped the consequences, he started to feel sick all of a sudden. As long as he didn’t manage to re-establish a connection to the internet, to go back to the website he had visited and to click on the “Stop” button, his muscles would keep growing and growing. As if to confirm Ben’s thoughts, the crunching and cracking increased a little, and Ben could hear a ripping sound as the seams on his sleeves gave way, his shirt no longer being able to contain the huge mass of his growing muscles. Ben realised that he needed to act quickly, but he wasn’t exactly sure what he should do.</p>
