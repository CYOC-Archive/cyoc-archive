<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha Anderson was finding herself growing more attracted to her guests. She would be hard pressed to say which one turned her on more, the curvy blonde Samantha or the red haired Frances, even without their added ability to become werecats, something she promised herself to go to the town library and research further when she had the time.<br />
However, their conversation was interrupted when a voice called out from the kitchen, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m home!&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my son Eric. I&#39;ll be right back. Would you ladies like more tea?&quot; asked the housewife.<br />
&quot;Yes, please,&quot; said Frances.<br />
After Mrs. Anderson collected their cups and went to the kitchen, Frances turned to Samantha and asked in a whisper, &quot;Have you been using your pheromones on her?&quot;<br />
Samantha had a shocked look on her face, but then finally whispered, &quot;Maybe a little,&quot; in reply.<br />
&quot;Well, stop it,&quot; admonished Frances. &quot;Whether or not Martha is attracted to either or both of us, let alone whether or not she decides to become a werecat too, she has to do so of her own free will. You know how the Elders will react if they find out otherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; whispered Samantha. &quot;But I was right about her, wasn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Frances. &quot;Martha is quite sexy. Yet I think she&#39;ll have enough on her mind her in the coming days between Nate getting ready for his induction ceremony and whether or not any of the other groups are working on her husband and other son to join were society too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mister Anderson sat at his desk, grading papers as his current class left the lecture hall. His next class was scheduled to begin in half an hour, so there was no point in going to his office.<br />
Then he noticed one student was still in the room.<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Maybe I can help you,&quot; said the co-ed, as she got up from her seat and approached her teacher. &quot;My name is Yvette,&quot; she said in a seductive voice. &quot;Besides being highly interested in the curriculum, I&#39;m also <i>highly</i> interested in the instructor,&quot; she added, bending forward so he could see into the valley of her breasts. Yvette was <b>not</b> wearing a bra, and her tight t-shirt looked like it might lose the battle to restrain her bosom at any moment.<br />
&quot;Err, yes,&quot; he said, starting to feel himself tense, and aroused. &quot;You do know that—&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I know all of this place&#39;s stupid rules. But I also know that rules were made to be broken,&quot; said Yvette, as she straightened herself up and licked her lips. &quot;You don&#39;t have to give me an answer now, but know that I&#39;m also into older men, because I feel experienced men are better lovers, and I&#39;m a highly skilled and even more highly sexed were-vixen. Look my species up in the university&#39;s computers and think about it,&quot; she added, before leaving the lecture hall.<br />
Mister Anderson watched her leave, every step making her ass sway seductively as she walked out the door.<br />
He remembered the troubles of his past, and thought about his present. <i>If Martha isn&#39;t in the mood when I get home, I hope we have plenty of cold water!</i><br />
<br />
Martha told Eric the news while she fixed him an after school snack.<br />
&quot;Are we going to be allowed to stay up that late?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Yes. We won&#39;t be able to see everything, but we should be there for Nate, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
Eric agreed, then excused himself to go upstairs and do his homework.<br />
He went up the back staircase to his room, but didn&#39;t feel like tackling Introductory Algebra right now as he said down at his desk with the baloney sandwich and can of soda his mother gave him.<br />
Eric knew of his older brother&#39;s interest in monster movies in general and werewolves specifically, but to actually go through with it?<br />
<i>And then he&#39;ll probably get to stay out late on wolf nights,</i> realized Eric, wondering whether or not that was fair to someone that couldn&#39;t change.<br />
Eric wasn&#39;t sure whether or not to be happy for Nate, let alone whether or not to complain if he started getting special privileges because of his new status.<br />
Eric Anderson was so lost in thought about trying to figure out his feelings concerning Nate&#39;s news, that he forgot to tell his mother about meeting Julie during lunch.<br />
They had no classes together, although they were both in the same grade. The brunette looked cute, and over the school&#39;s idea of meatloaf, the two found out they had a lot in common and started hitting it off when the bell rang to go to their next classes.<br />
Julie made him promise to look her up during lunch again tomorrow.<br />
Eric wasn&#39;t sure how he felt about her, let alone didn&#39;t know what love actually was or if he was even in it, but it would be nice to have a new friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. We&#39;ll see you sometime this Saturday,&quot; said Ben, as he hung up the house phone. &quot;It&#39;s all set,&quot; he told Nate. &quot;Our pack leader lives a few miles from my place, so you come here, and then I&#39;ll get one of my moms to drive us over. He wants to meet you before the ceremony. You know, make sure you&#39;re doing this of your own free will, you know what you&#39;re getting into. Stuff like that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like an entrance exam?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s just a formality. You&#39;ll pass with flying colors,&quot; Ben reassured him. &quot;Meanwhile, there are a few things you should know about what to expect that I can tell you now. First off, the rest of the pack will already be in full wolf form when we meet, but you stay fully dressed until after all our visitors leave the opening ceremony.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is what?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;Basically our pack leader makes a speech about werewolf society and its history, before saying a few words about the importance and significance of the induction ceremony to each new arrival. Right now, it looks like you&#39;re the only new member, so that part probably won&#39;t last long,&quot; said Ben. &quot;Then everyone else leaves while we go deeper into the woods to welcome you into our group. You&#39;ll want to be dressed halfway decent, like you&#39;re going to school, but be sure to wear something that you won&#39;t mind getting ripped up and shredded.&quot;<br />
&quot;What actually happens when I—&quot; Nate started to say, but was too excited at the prospect of what was to come to finish speaking.<br />
&quot;When you become a werewolf?&quot; Ben finished for him. &quot;What you&#39;ll do is pick someone to change you into a werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;How?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nobody has chosen the more old fashioned way of being bitten in decades. So it will be the more modern method.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is...&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t speak for every pack, but in ours, whoever you pick rips your clothes off and you have sex with them,&quot; revealed Ben. &quot;You&#39;ll change for the first time during that. Something about intimate exposure to werewolf fluids, or something scientifically like that.&quot;<br />
Nate sat in his chair, speechless. When Ben realized why, he asked, &quot;Are you still a virgin?&quot;<br />
Nate simply nodded his head affirmatively.<br />
&quot;Well, you won&#39;t be after next Saturday night,&quot; said Ben with a smile.<br />
&quot;But what if I get the lady pregnant?&quot; asked Nate, remembering the sex education class from his last school.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret. Every were-female in Moon Lake is on birth control pills specially formulated for their individual species. So unless the woman has stopped taking her pills because they <i>want</i> to get pregnant...&quot;<br />
Nate paused and thought about that for a moment, the smile on his face growing bigger in the process. Then he thought to ask Ben, &quot;What happens after I have my first change?&quot;<br />
&quot;Everybody, including you, howls at the moon to celebrate. Then, depending upon their moods; we either go hunting, call it a night, or have an orgy.&quot;<br />
Nate stared directly at his friend and asked, &quot;Are you serious?&quot;<br />
Ben simply smiled in response.</p>
