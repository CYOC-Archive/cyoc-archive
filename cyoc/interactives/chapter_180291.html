<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on guys, let&#39;s check it out. You know the stories here are pretty juicy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luis, come on man. You really believe this place&#39;s hype?&quot;<br />
<br />
The five friends got out of the car at once and started heading for the farmhouse. Their car was large, black, and had the logo of their would be &quot;show&quot; on the side. Burlingdon Ghost Investigators! They saw themselves as the next big show to come on their current patron network. And while they had been in talks with a network executive, it seemed they weren&#39;t really taken all that seriously. So they decided to come out to this farmhouse and see if they could find some hint of paranormal activity here after hearing of some odd experiences and disappearances of former home owners.<br />
<br />
Of the group, there was the narcissistic leading man Luis Cruz, a powerfully built Latino would be bodybuilder and pretty boy. 25 years old, Luis Cruz made a name for himself around his college campus as a lady&#39;s man. His hair was cut short, and his light blue eyes hinted at some white ancestry. His skin was bronze tanned naturally, and while most of his family were hairballs, Luis put in the entire effort needed to wax his body so &quot;chicks didn&#39;t need to deal with body hair to see MY physique&quot;. There WERE rumors about men and some encounters, but Luis was always adamant about the fact he was straight as an arrow. He was one of the believers of the group - rather superstitious, that one. He dressed in a stringer shirt despite the chill, jeans, and sneaker shoes.<br />
<br />
Kyle O&#39;Leary was the understudy to Luis, a pale, red haired Irish lad with light facial hair, green eyes, and a heavily built figure. He was stockier and heavier than Luis, no abs there. He was known for eating -  a lot - and for pushing himself to an insane degree in the gym. He had his own goals separate from those of Luis, and had developed into his physique both as a result of his eating habits and as a result of how he preferred to train. He was wearing a short sleeved green and white t-shirt with a pocket on the front, slacks, and athletic shoes.<br />
<br />
The object of both Luis and Kyle&#39;s affection was the very pretty Carla Cleese. She had been a fat girl early on in her high school life, and, once she slimmed up and became athletic, she compensated for the bullying she had received by dishing it out just as well. Her long, wavy black hair and slate gray eyes plus her clear, beautiful face gave her quite an appealing look. She was one of the hard bodied cheerleader type, going along with this due to her desire for fame. She was dressed in a black short jacket, a blouse, jeans, and heels. She made it a habit to try and get both Luis and Kyle in her bed, but due to the rivalry between them as a result of the games she played, there was little chance of that.<br />
<br />
Todd Ramos was one of the few reasonably interested people in this for its own sake. He had a curly mess of light brown hair on his head, a slight tan, and brown eyes. He had previously been a typical stringbean nerd, but owing to Luis feeling bad for him constantly striking out with girls, Luis helped him work on his physique. Thus Todd went from an awkward, earnest and thin nerdy guy to a built, awkward and earnest nerdy guy always wearing shirts a little too small for him. Such is Todd as he walked out alongside the others - dressed in a tight long sleeved t-shirt, showing off his abs and tightly toned pecs, his pants likewise a little too tight, his glutes on full display. Despite being reasonably handsome and muscular, Todd worried his tight clothes might make him look odd in front of a camera.<br />
<br />
And lastly there was Cassandra Blaire, the tech expert. Somewhat chubby and short, she was spared from being picked on by Carla due to helping her set up and ready her social media and computer equipment for the show. Carla, never one to forget a due, thus defended Cass in front of the other women in college. Somewhat long dark brown hair and blue eyes behind glasses, the frumpy Cassandra was dressed in a blouse and skirt that fit the &quot;dark&quot; tone of the typical ghost show. She carried a laptop with her at all times. She pined after Todd, though it seemed the nerd was far too awkward to make the first move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I do in fact believe this place&#39;s hype. Have you heard the stories? We&#39;ve got our big &quot;in&quot; for the show!&quot; Luis grinned and posed himself up by the front door. Supposedly the farmhouse was abandoned, the last few owners having disappeared. Among other oddities sighted there, some said they saw odd humanoid figures in the forests nearby, heard ghostly screams in the distance, and saw a strange red eyed horse that seemed made of shadow.<br />
<br />
Skinwalkers? Ghosts? Demons? Someone with a severely overactive imagination? Whatever the case, it would be profitable for the network and get the young folks in the Ghost Investigation team the start to their fame. Once they had their feet in the door, the network would pay hand over foot to send them to reportedly haunted places. Whether they were really haunted or not - just as long as the sweet viewer numbers rolled in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, I-I-I&#39;m getting a pretty eerie vibe from this place. Should we e-even be here?&quot; Todd murmured, looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry your ass off, Todd,&quot; Luis moved over and swung his arm around Todd&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Your bro Luis has got your back. Any crazy hobo or squatter gets up in your grill, I&#39;ll make sure they regret it immediately. Let alone any ghosts or ghouls.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Todd immediately feel a bit more safe. Luis and he had a certainly odd friendship starting when the two of them started training together. Luis was like a surrogate older brother to Todd, at least that was how he interpreted their relationship. Luis taught him how to build muscle, talk to girls (he still needed help on that though), and how to try to assert himself - though Todd was still quite shy. &quot;Thanks man, you&#39;re a real bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it!&quot; As the two of them fistbumped, it seemed Kyle watched with his own conclusions in mind. He was one of the &quot;Luis Secretly Sleeps With Men&quot; club, and he assumed there were some things going on between Luis and Todd that didn&#39;t make it into public knowledge. Why else, Kyle assumed, would a guy as otherwise pushy and crude as Luis hang around with and show so much niceness and affection for a dweeb like Todd?<br />
<br />
Kyle asked, &quot;I could get the ghost box started up. I&#39;m feeling down to try that out, see what kinda noises are lurking around in the local uhh, energy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassandra nodded quickly and took out the ghost box they used for their investigations from her backpack. Sliding it across the floor, she looked at the others. &quot;Here ya go. Let&#39;s get this whole thing started.&quot; She wished Todd would stand up for himself a bit more. He was honestly the most attractive one to her. His nerdy shy appearance, together with his muscles and good nature made her want him all the more. It was just that she didn&#39;t want to spook him out of going for her - he might view a move on him a certain way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahah, yeah, let&#39;s see what kinda fucky ghosts and ghouls are lurking around the airwaves here!&quot; Kyle shouted and took a seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haah, boys, I swear.&quot; Carla shook her head and looked at Cassandra. &quot;You know, if you don&#39;t make a move...&quot; She whispered, &quot;He&#39;ll get away from you. You don&#39;t want that, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassandra just silently shook her head, and looked at Carla, &quot;I mean...&quot; She whispered as Todd ran off with Luis to physically investigate the rest of the house, &quot;I just don&#39;t want to scare him off of being involved with me. You know how he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cass, Todd is a man. A friend of Luis at that.&quot; Carla smiled a little, and continued, &quot;Just touch his &quot;Lil Todd&quot; and see how he reacts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassandra flushed red at the thought and bit her lip, wondering if such an amazingly forward approach would work on Todd. She watched him and Luis fully disappear upstairs. Maybe this would be her chance...<br />
<br />
None of the college goers in the farmhouse even noticed that, outside of the nearest shuttered window, the dark figure of the black stallion watched the five go about their activities. Humans and their puerile games. Well, with so many, it would take a little while to work his magic over them. They might come and go, but the magic would keep transforming them. Keep bringing them back. It should be interesting then to see how they react to it...</p>
