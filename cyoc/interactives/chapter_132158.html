<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;*squeal* GET OUT! GET OUT! I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d think I was being unfaithful!&quot; Maggie screamed. &quot;Five years and you think I&#39;d sleep with another man! How dare you!&quot; She slammed the front door with so much force Nolan thought it shook his window. He stood up and looked across the street to the once again fighting couple. James stood dumbfounded on the stoop of the door, he shuffled around a bit before walking down the sidewalk. It seems whatever the fight was about, he planned to let Maggie cool down first. Nolan felt for the guy, working to provide for a woman he loved (convoluted as it was) and she was milking him for all he had. Their relationship had one obvious problem; Maggie. <br />
<br />
Nolan right then and there knew that he had to do something. If not for James then for the peace of the neighborhood. The only way James was going to leave Maggie is if he caught her in the act, Nolan had to act fast, James would be back from his walk shortly.<br />
<br />
As he crossed the street he thought about using the watch to just make Maggie leave or James to kick her out, but that didn&#39;t feel right. Forcing something like that would leave Nolan power drunk, James had to make this decision on his own. Nolan would just lay the information out for him. <br />
<br />
He walked up the steps and to the door taking a deep breath before knocking. He could hear the heavy hoff steps of her trotters on the other side of the door. &quot;Who are you?&quot; the pig woman spat at him. Even though he&#39;d seen her just earlier today it was still shocking.<br />
<br />
She stood plump and round, so large that she seemed to take up the door frame. Still naked, her four sets of DD breasts sat atop her fat gut. She rested her arm against the doorway, showing her hairy underarms to the world. Her stance was wide, projecting her swollen pussy outward into view. Whether this was because she was a pig now or that she just didn&#39;t care was unknown, though he got the feeling it was the latter of the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to bother you miss, but my car won&#39;t start and my phone isn&#39;t getting any signal. Could I come in and use your phone to call a tow truck?&quot; Nolan quickly pointed to a random car on the street. It was a long shot that Maggie would be so kind to a stranger, but he lucked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure come in, phone’s in the living room.&quot; she waved him inside, not at all pleased to do so. He followed her into the living room, the house was saturated with a heavy musk of BO and gas. It almost hurt to breathe inside, luckily she left the front door cracked and that helped make the odor more bearable. She pointed to the phone on the coffee table and flopped onto the couch with her legs split open. She watched TV with one hand propping up her head and the other disappeared into her curly bush, scratching an itch. <br />
<br />
Nolan pretended to call for a truck on the phone, all the while taking in the sight of Maggie in her shameless pose. She clearly didn&#39;t seem to care that he was there. He hung up the phone and handed it back to her. &quot;So, do you live here alone?&quot; he asked. <br />
&quot;No, this is my boyfriend&#39;s place.&quot; She said nonchalantly. <br />
&quot;Oh? Is he here?&quot; <br />
&quot;No, the little punk accused me of sleeping around, I told him off and now he&#39;s out cooling down.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry to hear that.&quot; Nolan tried his best to sound sincere.<br />
Maggie waved it off &quot;it&#39;s whatever.&quot;<br />
&quot;No! You can&#39;t just say that,&quot; she turned to look at him, her eyebrow raised.<br />
&quot;You deserve a man who&#39;ll trust you and treat you better than that!&quot; She was intrigued now. &quot;Someone who&#39;ll satisfy you however you want! That&#39;s how a real man should treat a woman like you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah! YEAH! you&#39;re right!&quot; She was buying into it now. <br />
&quot;You need attention and love just like any woman needs!&quot; <br />
&quot;YEAH! And I&#39;m a whole lot of woman too!&quot; She commented proudly. <br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be helped if you need multiple suitors to satisfy your needs!&quot; He slipped in.<br />
&quot;Hell yeah!&quot; She shouted! Then her fat pink face turned pale, suddenly realizing she just confessed to cheating. The room fell silent before she regained her composure, gasping at the words like she would somehow un-say them. She quickly changed the topic. &quot;So how long will that dumb tow truck take?&quot;<br />
&quot;They said about an hour. Hey, would you mind if I used your bathroom?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, but it’s late and you should wait outside. I don&#39;t want some stranger in my house while I sleep!&quot; She shouted, still flustered at her own outburst. &quot;It&#39;s straight up the stairs&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan ran up to the bathroom. He stopped only for a moment to view a handful of photos on the wall. They looked like vacation photos, mostly beach venues. In each one Maggie wore a different undersized bikini. It seemed that the watch didn&#39;t just filter out the changes, but edited the target&#39;s own history, making it normal. &quot;Well, guess that&#39;s one mystery solved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom Nolan tried to think of his next move, he truthfully hadn&#39;t expected to get this far. He tapped his finger to his chin, trying to come up with something. She was a fat pig woman, who clearly was open to the idea of a open relationship or just straight on sex. <br />
<br />
Nolan suddenly got it. &quot;If I appeal to her animal nature she&#39;ll break down in a second!&quot; Nolan turned the watch on himself and placed the commands before hitting apply.<br />
<br />
He was excited to finally try the watch on himself. He only wished it was something else he was becoming, but this wasn&#39;t bad for his first attempt. Nolan felt a warmth spread through his body, swirling within his muscles. He watched as his arms tensed up and swelled, becoming meatier by the second. The same happened in his legs, his pants tightening around his thighs. In fact, everything felt tight.<br />
<br />
He began to strip out of his shrinking clothes, knowing full well they&#39;d be destroyed otherwise. He watched in the mirror as his shoulders widened, helping to support his new bulk. Then the real changes started. He felt a trembling in his fingers and watched as his pinky and ring finger fused together, the rest swelling to match and his nails growing thicker. Small bristly hairs sprouted up his forearms and a soft film of fat softened his arms. <br />
<br />
He felt himself rise upward, looking down to watch his toes fuse and reshape, the nails growing thicker into large trotters. He almost fell over as his weight shifted, throwing him off balance. The film of fat swept under his legs, losing his muscle tone. His butt swelled as well, becoming soft and pudgy and with a pinch, a curly tail sprung up out of his spine.<br />
<br />
Nolan marveled at his new strong build in the mirror when his stomach rumbled. He rapidly gained weight as his stomach ballooned out into an impressive gut. His pecs likewise lost some of their luster, sagging into firm moobs.<br />
<br />
With his hands he grabbed at the flabby gut. Disappointed at his new physique he let out a sigh, except it came out as a snort.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the mirror he watched his nose turn upward and expand into a snout. His jaw stretching out, two teeth grew outward into large tusks just as his ears pulled into a point and flopped over.<br />
<br />
Lastly he felt a tickling sensation in his crotch as his member grew and swelled into proportion, filling with blood, standing at an impressive ten inches long and two inches thick! A thick coat of body hair followed around his crotch, arms, and chest, leaving Nolan as a true alpha male boar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What&#39;s taking so long in there! *squeal*&quot; Maggie yelled banging on the bathroom door. Nolan smiled, eager to test his theory. He unlocked the door and it slammed open as Maggie barged in.<br />
<br />
She stopped dead in her tracks. Her nose snorted and flared as she caught wind of Nolan&#39;s scent. He stood proudly in the cramped bathroom, letting nature take its course.<br />
<br />
Maggie&#39;s eyes darted across his body, his strong build, musky odor, primal confidence, but most of all his demanding erection. Maggie fell on all fours without a second thought, even without all the extra boarish parts that cock looked luscious!<br />
<br />
She crawled to him on her hands and knees, taking his member into her snout, sucking and licking it in every way possible. Maggie&#39;s skill left Nolan bracing himself against the walls of the bathroom to keep from falling as his knees grew weak. As her filatio continued so did her need, with a free hand she reached between her legs and dug two fat fingers into her needy snatch. Nolan began thrusting himself into her when his new nose picked up on her needing sex.<br />
<br />
He withdrew from Maggie, flipping her onto her back and pinning her to the ground. Maggie let out a piercing squeal as Nolan drove his rigid cock into her needing pussy. He quickly scooped her thighs into his grip, lifting her into the air with his newfound strength and carrying her out of the bathroom and onto her bed.<br />
<br />
Nolan laid into her, with all his newly found primal lust leaving Maggie squealing, grunting, and moaning like a lewd orchestra. The neighborhood was filled with the noise, surely upsetting everyone living there.<br />
<br />
Nolan continued his rut until he heard the front door slam open, the pounding of the staircase, and James bursting through the bedroom door...</p>
