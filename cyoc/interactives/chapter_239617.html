<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The app had been surprisingly silent about Jose.  There hadn’t been any suggestions or visions that had been forced into Steve’s mind.  Then again, if the app’s preferences were anything like Steve’s – and he had every reason to think that they were – it probably got a pretty good kick out of what he’d done to Jose.  Still, Steve couldn’t shake that strange feeling of déjà vu.<br />
<br />
Selecting Austin again, he generated a new sentence in the hope that doing so would tell him something about this feeling that he had.<br />
<br />
“The pregnant anthro bitch is laboring in the community center.”<br />
<br />
Nope, nothing there to enlighten Steve on what was going on.  Plus, Steve couldn’t really think of anything he wanted to change.  Then again, what if he changed something about the community center?  Would the building change?  What about the people inside of it?  Would they change too?<br />
<br />
He had come here to transform all of these people, and he had turned Austin into an anthro breeding slave…  Maybe he should… finish the job?  He selected “the community” and changed it to “slave birthing”.  <br />
<br />
That should result in the building changing from its current form and into a slave birthing center – whatever that was.  While Steve would liked to limit the change to just make a birthing center, the fact that there was an anthro slave in there would create a huge amount of ambiguity.  Steve wasn’t interested in seeing how the app resolved that ambiguity and, using the bizarre logic that now applied to the situation, turning it into a birthing center for slaves was somehow the change that was most consistent with the situation unfolding inside.<br />
<br />
Steve hit submit, only for a warning to popup on the screen:<br />
<br />
“Battery Usage Warning: 14 other targets in range will be affected by this change.  This may drain your battery.  Proceed?”<br />
<br />
Well, that answered one of Steve’s questions – changing the building would change the people inside of it.  Plus his battery would run out, so that would be it for tonight.  There was no going back from whatever changes occurred – those players would all end the night in new forever bodies.<br />
<br />
So, should he do it?  Steve was on the fence.  Part of him wanted to just say fuck it and see what happened, while a more moderate voice told him that it was too risky and that he should take things slower.  <br />
<br />
A hesitant finger inched closer to proceed button on the screen.  Would he do it?  There was so much trepidation in Steve’s mind that he wasn’t sure if he’d manage to hit the button, despite the fact that his finger kept inching closer and closer to it.<br />
<br />
As Steve’s finger continued its slow descent towards the phone, the faint smell of garlicy skunk spray wafted through his nose.  He wasn’t sure where it was coming from, but he got the sense that the scent was some attempt to warn him, but warn him about what?<br />
<br />
Steve hadn’t decided what to do yet, so did the app want him to push the button or not?  And was this even the app giving him the warning?  It felt a lot less ominous than the app’s previous warnings, which had all come as somewhat direct commands.  This felt more similar to the instincts that he’d experienced back when he was a laboring rabbit – and he distinctly remembered how those instincts had tried to trick him into remaining in that form.<br />
<br />
The skunk smell intensified as it seemed to fill the car.  Ok, Steve thought, let’s say this is a warning.  The app runs on logic, so think this through logically.  The app said it would change 14 people in the target area.  The target area is the community center.  The doors are locked, and you are outside of that center, so you are outside the area.<br />
<br />
That was reassuring, but Steve knew the risk he was taking and wanted to make absolutely sure that he understood the app’s warning.  He switched to the targeting screen and counted the targets inside of the center; confirming that yes, he was remembering correctly and there were 14 targets in there, including Austin and her pussy.  The logic was solid – Steve was not going to be affected by this change.<br />
<br />
So, what was with the smell?  What was it warning him about?  If he did this change the battery would die and Steve literally would not be able to make any more changes with the app tonight.  That meant that it would be impossible for him to turn into the skunk that the app had shown him earlier, and which he was presumably now smelling.<br />
<br />
Conversely, if Steve generated a new sentence, he’d probably spend the next hour or two changing the people inside.  That was plenty of time for him to screw up and inadvertently change himself or, worse, for the app to cause him to black out again and force a change on him.  <br />
<br />
Besides, he’d *seen* the sentence that led to him ending up as a skunk.  As best as Steve could guess, his seatbelt was probably broken and, in a failed attempt to fix it, he was going to end up monkey pawing himself into smelly motherhood.  <br />
<br />
Then there was the app itself.  While it had seemed upset with him earlier, Steve could only imagine that he’d made amends with the changes to Jose, and he was generally doing what it told him to do even if he had given a little pushback earlier.  It made no sense for it to try to harm him now – if anything it made sense that it would try to help him avoid a future like that.<br />
<br />
Steve took a deep breath, and the smell vanished as if to tell him that he was making the right choice.</p>
