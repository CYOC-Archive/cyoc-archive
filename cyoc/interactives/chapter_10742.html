<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Allen! Look what you did to my cousin! You made him into an overgrown muscle FREAK! I can’t allow this… You’re killing him with all that muscle! I’m gonna have to take your power away from you…” Ty began to shout at Allen, just as Peter was slowly beginning to move his oversized body. He now had mustered enough strength to try to sit up on the hardwood floor.<br />
<br />
“Awww Ty! Come on…” Allen pleaded with Ty.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Allen. I wish for your power to transform Peter any way you want to be…” Ty began to say out loud.<br />
<br />
“HOLD IT, TY!” a voice shouted at him. Ty and Allen looked up and realized that there was a tall, slender man dressed in a black coat who was watching them. The man wore sunglasses and a black hat. It was Prince, who was Peter’s mentor and instructor.<br />
<br />
“Instead of taking Allen’s power away, I would suggest just modifying his powers slightly. Allen and Ty, come with me. Leave Peter in the gym, for you will meet him at the beach later on!” Prince instructed Allen and Ty. They quickly followed Prince out of the gym, and Jason tagged behind Ty, but from a distance.<br />
<br />
Once they were outside, Prince pulled Ty and Allen aside and began to talk to them. <br />
<br />
“I can understand Ty’s concern for his cousin and his amazing muscular growth,” Prince explained to Allen, “But I also realize that you can make Peter grow too big. Therefore, I will just modify your powers a little bit, so that nobody gets hurt. I have read your mind and I realize that you care a lot about Peter; you just want to make him grow all the time. And Peter has never complained about his muscular growth spurts, because he actually enjoys the feeling of having his muscles increased! From now on, his body will grow in size as well so that it can allow for his muscles to grow as big as you want to. I will allow you to keep your powers permanently, because I see there is a great benefit in all this and I realize that these growth spurts are only temporary anyway. Not only that, but you can allow Peter to have the necessary strength when he needs it. The only other change I want to see is that the magnitude of Peter’s muscular growth will also be cast on to your own body, so that both of you will be equal in size. You will become more sensitive to muscle growth from now on. Just look at a magazine photo of a bodybuilder, and you shall see some change. Just be sure never to grow Peter any bigger than you would want to become yourself!”<br />
<br />
Prince gently placed his right hand on Allen’s forehead and he closed his eyes. He made a silent wish, and then he opened his eyes while he looked down at Allen with a smile on his face. Then Prince disappeared before their eyes, and Ty looked at Allen in shock! <br />
<br />
“Wow! I can’t believe it! He actually let you keep your power over my cousin! There must be a reason for it, but I don’t know what it is…” Ty said to Allen.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m going to watch a bodybuilding contest. How about you?” Allen asked Ty.<br />
<br />
“I had planned on going to the beach with Dustin, Ryan and Peter. So I had better get going. See you later, Allen!” Ty said, as he wished himself to appear back in his bedroom at home.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, Allen had arrived at the bodybuilding contest…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back inside the gym, Peter had gained enough strength to stand up on his own again. He had to get used to his incredible weight, and at the same time enjoyed the feeling of having his muscles grow to such proportions in such a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
Peter finally felt his body stop growing, he had NEVER felt such an intense growth spurt, and his mind was still rushing from excitement and emotions. But it all meant nothing when Peter looked at his figure – “HOLY COW!!!”<br />
<br />
Peter was 18’tall but he knew he now weighed over 20 thousand pounds! He looked at his gigantic shoulders, they were precisely 9 feet apart, his chest had ballooned to gargantuan proportions – over 200 inches around, but his arms looked even bigger, they actually touched the ground, and his hands were the biggest paws in the world, Peter knew his pinky finger was thicker than the biggest bodybuilder’s biceps. Peter flexed his guns and almost passed out as he saw the gargantuan size his arms had peaked into – they had to be over 150 inches.<br />
<br />
His legs were so thick, he couldn’t stand perfectly, the mammoth thighs struggled for space, and his back was wide flattened against the gym ceiling. Peter barely flexed his muscles and he felt the gym roof giving up to his super strength. The ultra muscular lad had no other choice but getting out of the cramped space which he used to call “gym”.<br />
<br />
Peter walked out of the gym – “Is everybody okay?” He asked with his now thundering voice, he feared his growth had hurt someone, but fortunately the gym was not very crowded in that afternoon, only a few instructors and staff workers had rushed as soon as they felt the ground shaking due the astronomical weight of Peter.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry; I will fix your gym!” Peter focused and the roof rebuilt itself in a matter of seconds, it was even a little higher about 30 feet high – “Maybe Ryan can start training here, after all!” Peter said to himself, but then he remembered his freakiest muscles – “Oh man! I must be almost as muscular as Ryan, but WAAAY shorter!” he considered as he watched his widest and thickest figure, his back was so thick and his shoulders so wide he really looked like a comic book muscle monster – “I gotta get back to my normal size!” He tried but he had to stop soon, because he only felt his body enlarging even more, he must have gained 100 pounds with just the mere thought of getting back to normal.<br />
<br />
“Allen’s powers are so strong now, how come he had been able to change me, without even being with me?” Peter asked to himself as he leaped into the skies. “I gotta say, it kinda feels awesome being so FREAKY muscular!”  Peter smiled and landed exactly at Dustin’s house where his big little brother trained.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ryan!” Peter greeted with a big smile.<br />
<br />
“PETE? What happened to you?” The huge 25`tall muscle giant approached and looked at his big brother – Although Ryan was still bigger and noticeably more muscular than Peter; the TF Wizard looked much thicker than the boy titan.<br />
<br />
“Allen did this to me! But I still don’t know how!” Peter laughed – “I ended up outgrowing the whole gym! Peter scratched his head “But I don’t know if it had stopped!”<br />
<br />
“What you mean?” Ryan asked curious and Peter felt his growth spurts restarting all over again – his muscles engorging, his veins getting thicker, his limbs becoming more and more powerful, his body getting even thicker – soon Peter had grown to Ryan’s incredible height 25’ tall but he should weigh two times heavier than his little brother.<br />
<br />
“PETER! You look amazing!” Ryan said flexing his biceps and comparing to Peter’s incredible guns – “Bro, your arms are twice the size of my guns!” He finally said.<br />
<br />
“Ryan… Please, I don’t know what happened, please forgive me!” Peter said apprehensive.<br />
<br />
“Forgive you? WHY? You look amazing! Come on let’s flex together!” Ryan cheered and Peter joined him, completely eclipsing the already gargantuan size of his titanic brother, each muscles was more than twice bigger than Ryan’s and being at the same height, Peter looked much stronger than Ryan, although is sounded impossible even to Peter’s capabilities. Finally, they hugged, or better, Ryan tried to hug Peter but they were just too dam thick to completely embrace, they could barely touch their foreheads together – “WE are too massive, big brother!” Ryan and Peter laughed out loud.<br />
<br />
“Ryan, I don’t know what Allen is doing, but it sure feels great!” Peter smiled.<br />
<br />
“Where you think Allen is, anyway?” The titan boy asked curious.<br />
<br />
“I have an idea, but I am afraid of meeting him, maybe he will keep growing me!”<br />
<br />
“And what’s the matter with that? I would love wearing your shoes!” Ryan teased.<br />
<br />
“Okay, let’s go find him!” Peter wished himself and Ryan to be with Allen. <br />
Then in a moment, they were transported to the City’s Exposition Center, where the Annual Bodybuilding Contest was being held, and soon Peter understood what happened.<br />
People ran, screamed, others cheered.<br />
<br />
Allen’s 25`tall ultra muscular body had grown through the roof, and he watched in shock to the little people scared at his inhumanly big muscles. Peter smiled when people noticed there were not just one titan, but three amazingly muscular titanic male teens he felt an empathic link with Allen, he could tell that his powers were somehow enhanced, but more than that, Allen now shared some of Peter’s incredible power – he could fell that his friend had triggered his magical powers in retribution. Peter had increased Allen’s figure the same way Allen had increased Peter’s. <br />
<br />
They both looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“Peter! You look amazing, just the way I pictured!” Allen said a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“No wonder! Look at yourself! You’re a muscle monster!” Peter approached and helped Allen get out of the stage without tearing it down.<br />
<br />
“I-I don’t know what happened!” Allen started  - “I was watching the show, and suddenly though how cool you would look being just as big as those guys, but suddenly I started growing and growing, every big guy I saw I felt my body enlarging and it kept on and on…”<br />
<br />
“I felt that too!” Peter continued “Then, I felt an energy rush coming from you, at the same time it also flushed from me towards you, it was like we fed each others growth!”<br />
<br />
“AMAZING!” Ryan shouted as he compared his body with Allen’s – “you two are the biggest muscle freaks ever! And I know what I am talking about!” Ryan said as he asked Allen to flex his gigantic biceps.<br />
<br />
“What are we gonna do now, Peter?” Allen asked a little nervous.<br />
<br />
“Well, I believe we will be able to get back to normal, eventually, we just have to spend the energy boost which caused our growth, meanwhile why don’t we have some fun? It’s not always we can make Ryan look a piece of spaghetti!” Peter teased and he flexed his muscles to emphasize his opinion.<br />
<br />
“I know, I know! Dustin and Ty are spending the day at Muscle Beach! Why don’t the three of us show them what is a REAL MUSCLE BEACH?”  Ryan smiled meanly.<br />
<br />
“You’re on!” Allen answered.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go!” Peter said and the three of them leaped into the skies, since Peter had wished Allen also to have the flying ability, and the three of them went to the MUSCLE BEACH!<br />
<br />
When Peter, Allen and Ryan arrived at the beach, it was an incredible site. People lined up to watch the three muscle giants, who were only wearing super-stretchy Speedos so they could show off their titanic, muscular bodies. <br />
<br />
“Guys, let’s give them a show! Let’s have our very own bodybuilder show, right here on the beach!” Allen whispered to Peter and Ryan. Both of them agreed and they lined up standing next to each other, with their backs facing the ocean as they were just a few feet away from the shore. Then all three of them showed incredible muscular poses, to the gasps and cheers of the crowd. Even Ty, Dustin and Rob had joined the group of onlookers, who were delighted to watch the live muscle demonstration by the three giant teens. <br />
<br />
Allen loved the idea of being so big, and he wanted to be even bigger! But he realized that he could not grow his own self without growing Peter first, so he turned towards Peter and wished for him to double in height! Not only did Peter look older, since he still resembled a 21 year-old man, but he suddenly began to grow bigger and taller again.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! I’m growing again! Allen! What are you doing?” Peter said, as he looked down and realized that his head was rising further away from the ground, while his body continued to grow. He tried to stop it with a wish, but couldn’t. Prince had made Allen strong enough to override Peter’s own power for just a little while.<br />
<br />
Peter now stood an incredible 60 feet tall, towering over everyone with his muscles. As soon as his phenominal growth spurt had ended, Allen began to grow to exactly the same size! Ryan gasped as he suddenly found himself standing in between two muscle giants, who were actually BIGGER than him! That has never happened to Ryan before, and he actually began to feel a bit “small” compared to Allen and Peter!<br />
<br />
But Allen and Peter decided to have some fun with that, and they grabbed hold of Ryan and they lifted the muscle boy on top of their giant shoulders!  Ryan actually got to sit on Peter’s biceps, while the three of them posed for the tourists who were snapping pictures with their cameras. Ty, Jason, Dustin and Rob eventually joined the three muscle men, as they all posed for the cameras. Then the group turned around and raced towards the ocean, diving into the waves on by one. What would the muscle giants do next?</p>
