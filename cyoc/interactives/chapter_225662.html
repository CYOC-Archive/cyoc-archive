<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After only a few days at Circes and Misery was beginning to grow restless. Sure the home was comfortable, the band allowed to practice as Lilith adjusted to her...new abilities but, there was so much to do.<br />
<br />
All Misery needed to do was watch the news. Political figures parroting the words of the One Humanity. Reports from both timelines about the actions of the Normal. Innocent men, women, and children were at risk, the last thing Misery wanted was for someone to end up like Karen. Calling  her rag tag team to the living room, the young woman now paced anxiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s up with you,&quot; Bong asked, the Korean vampire watching the dark wizard curiously. Misery now stopped, her eyes narrowing as she gazed at her companions. &quot;We need to get back out there,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;And we need some more muscle. I&#39;m going to need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our help,&quot; Set asked, the mummy stroking Miserys cat. &quot;Why? Seriously why? Didn&#39;t Jack put you on a leash?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Misey grumbled. &quot;He just wants us to be careful and...I can&#39;t do this without your help.&quot; The group grumbled, not liking the idea, obviously Misery would need to sweeten the deal. &quot;I can pay you,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;All the beer and cigarettes you could ever want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re listening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Misery sighed, thankful to at least gotten the groups attention. &quot;There&#39;s a necromancer named Jolie Deathflower,&quot; she said. &quot;Shes currently a prisoner but I think we can spring her, bring her into the fold as we try to take out the Normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the catch,&quot; Lilith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The catch is this girl is currently being held by the feds,&quot; Luca groaned. &quot;Misery here wants us to break a prisoner out of a secret government prison.&quot; Misery fidgeted on place. It was true, she needed their help breaking a prisoner out of a government building that was occupied by possible allies in this war.  The group would have to be insane to even consider doing this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it I&#39;m in,&quot; Bong shrugged.<br />
<br />
Misery gawked, her jaw dropping in shock at Bongs answer. &quot;Seriously?!&quot; Bong nodded, glancing at her band mates. &quot;Its not like we got anything else going on,&quot; she said. &quot;And I don&#39;t know about you guys but beating up a couple of feds sounds like a fun night.&quot; Misery now stared at her unlikely allies, shocked as they now seemed to agree with the Korean vampires statement. If she had known that the idea of mayhem would get them to tag along she would of led with that instead of booze and cigarettes.<br />
<br />
Lucky for Misery and her friends, the offices of S.P.E.A.R was lightly defended. Thanksgiving had left the office virtually deserted for the long weekend. With minimal staff, the group could sneak in, break Jolie out, and return to Circes Park without causing too much damage. As the five man team now emerged from a portal of darkness Misey created, they ducked into a side room to gain their bearings. &quot;Okay,&quot; Misery whispered. &quot;The holding cells are two floors down. If we take this path, we should be there in five minutes. Hopefully we don&#39;t run into anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay two things,&quot; Bong stated. &quot;One. I thought we were fucking up the man. Two, who the hell is Jolie Deathflower anyway?&quot; Misery sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of her nose before conjuring her plague mask. &quot;We&#39;re not here to fuck up the man first off. There&#39;s a chance we probably will have to work with these guys someday. Secondly Jolie is a necromancer. She used to be a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean used to be a vampire,&quot; Lilith hissed. &quot;How the hell can you used to be a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its complicated,&quot; Misery sighed. &quot;Basically she was a vampire sorceress who was able to resurrect herself. After that she became not so much a vampire but not quite human. She&#39;s...kind of hard to explain.&quot; Misery could see her explanation truely did nothing to give the group a definitive answer. Trying to get the group to focus, they all now placed masks on as they crept towards the holding cells.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for the group (or unfortunately for those who wanted to bust some skulls) the offices of S.P.E.A.R were mostly empty. As they now gazed at the floor of the holding cells, Misery furrowed her brow as she noticed the four security guards patrolling the area. &quot;Okay we need to take those guys out before we free Jolie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry we got this,&quot; Bong answered, a smirk on her face as she, Set, and Luca confidently stepped forward. Already a feeling of dread washed over Misery as she watched the trio of monsters advance. &quot;Dont kill them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bong rolled her eyes, Misery was certainly being a buzzkill. They would keep them alive, but it didn&#39;t mean they couldn&#39;t rough then up a little. Turning to her friends, she nodded as they sprang into action.<br />
<br />
Bong immediately sunk her teeth into a guard, draining the man of just enough blood to knockout him out without turning him. As she did that Set grabbed his partner by the neck, slamming his face into a wall. Misery and Lilith winced at the sound of the man&#39;s nose breaking as he slid down the wall in a bloody, unconscious mess. Finally Luca grabbed the final two guards by the neck, slamming their heads together and knocking them out. Just hearing the sound of the guards skulls colliding convinced everyone they would wake up with a concussion. &quot;Okay the coast is clear,&quot; Bong exclaimed happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really have to hit them so hard,&quot; Misery grumbled as she looked at the four guards. Bong shrugged, the five now looking at an obviously confused Jolie. Misery studied the girl carefully, surprised to see just how young the platinum haired necromancer looked. &quot;Hang on,&quot; Misery stated. &quot;Well get you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me but what do you think you are doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Misery and the others froze, slowly turning to see a well dressed, handsome young man gazing at them curiously. Already Misery could tell that whoever this was, was incredibly powerful. &quot;Ah the quiet type,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re just shy. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Geshp, now what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Misey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude is a freaking devil,&quot; Set said quickly. &quot;You didn&#39;t say anything about them having a freaking devil!&quot; Geshp smirked, slowly stepping forward as he studied the group carefully. &quot;Hmm very interesting,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Vampire, mummy, werewolf, a very dark wizard, and a girl who seems to have quite a bit of power. You five wouldn&#39;t be trying to free Jolie would you? I went through quite a bit of trouble trying to capture her. Hate to see all that effort go for nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pluto Dark Wave CRASH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Misey and the others jumped in surprise, watching as a massive black wave speed past them, slamming into the arrogant devil. Geshp was now thrown backwards, groaning as he tried to come to his senses. Whatever hit him felt like a Mack truck, every fiber of his being now ached as he tried to focus.<br />
<br />
Miaey and the others could do little more than stare in stunned silence as they looked at Lilith. The Solar Guardian of Pluto stood before them, unleashing a devastating attack at the approaching devil and incapacitating him for the moment. Realizing they had only moments, Misery now cast a spell, a portal appearing beneath Jolie before she vanished from her cell, leaving her restraints behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick go,&quot; Misery called, opening a portal for thr group to escape through. As they now vanished from sight, Geshp could only groan as he dusted himself off. Director McMillan was going to be furious about this.</p>
