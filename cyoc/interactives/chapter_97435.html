<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yvette&#39;s morning had begun quietly but the quiet had also served to remind her that she was alone. Escaped from the jail thanks to an angry werecoyote who decided she didn&#39;t want to room with a werefox and with the police likely hunting her. She had escaped the police by making it to the river and going through many of the typical means that mundane foxes used to escape hounds pursuing them, repeated crossing of the river that fed the lake from which Moon Lake got its name and at times doubling back over the same path shed ran down earlier at some point. It wasn&#39;t something that one would think of when running from the cops, but then Yvette knew that Moon Lake&#39;s police could easily track her scent, so running in a straight line wouldn&#39;t work, and getting caught wouldn&#39;t reunite her with William. Thus she had to use tactics that would fool their sense of smell, and eventually she had managed to get the police to lose her when they thought they had been led in circles.<br />
<br />
Though, while she had escaped, she was still on her own and without much in the way of direct comfort. She had things from her apartment, but the police were surely watching it, in case she returned. Getting anything from there would require finding where the police were watching it from and finding a back entrance, which she wouldn&#39;t find until she could get clothes and find a way to hide her face. The only ones who knew her scent were the police officers,the college professors and administrators she&#39;d had met or had dealings with,  and the Skulk members, but they didn&#39;t count for all of Moon Lake&#39;s population, so if she could hide her face, she might have a chance as the others wouldn&#39;t know her scent. But first, she needed clothing.<br />
<br />
After finishing off the leftover rabbits she had killed during the night, she had returned to her human form and walked into the waters of Moon Lake. It had gotten the worst of the dirt, grime, and rabbit blood off of her. Though, she also found the water cold as she walked out and into the tall dried out reeds that were on the lake&#39;s northeast shore, she had noticed that there was a lone boat out on the lake with a lone man in it. He was already awake and was putting something down in the boat, but was too far away for her to know if he was a were-beast  out fishing or a normal from a nearby campground. Regardless, Yvette knew she couldn&#39;t take any chances. She would need not only clothes now but to also get the police off of her immediate tail...<br />
<br />
So, while she was in her human form when she entered the reeds, she quickly felt her body warm as red orange fur grew out over much of her body and white fur blossomed out on her bountiful chest. She dropped onto all fours as she approached the actual shore, and the fact that the water was cold hurt some of the insulating warmth that her fur normally provided and thus when she emerged the blackish-brown fur on her hands, forearms, and her digitigrade feet was somewhat matted by the water, but doing so cut down on her profile as her brush like tail grew out behind her, her pointed ears settled on the top of her head and her vulpine muzzle completed its growth. Her slit pupil eyes glanced back to the fisherman who was watching her with a frustrated scowl. Yvette gave a low bark and then scampered into the woods, she hoped she&#39;d make good time before any police showed up to pick her scent again from where the fisherman had seen her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid fisherman... stupid cops... stupid rules,&quot; Yvette grumbled, &quot;Is it really so wrong for me to want a mate? Someone to love me? And William was handsome before I got him... and he had been with other women... the stuff I overheard at their home proved that... so he had to be an experienced lover... And his wife loves pussy, not him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mental rant only continued as she ran along. The lake wasn&#39;t too far outside Moon Lake, and if the police were on alert, they&#39;d have officers there quickly, and since many of them tended to be werewolves or weredogs, they would easily be able to outrun her if given permission to change during the day. Yvette&#39;s main hope there was that the police tied up their own effectiveness with their rules to give her an edge. Some of it had never made sense to Yvette. Nearly everyone in Moon Lake was a were-beast of some sort, and those that were normals but had either moved in with family where one member became a were-beast or had grown up in Moon Lake did know that many of their neighbors could turn into animals whenever they wanted. <br />
<br />
And nearly every were enjoyed the beauty, power, and/or grace they gained by their animal side, so why not share it? Why not flaunt it? Humanity with all their cameras and things was probably going to find out about the truth behind Moon Lake eventually... or at least about were-beasts, since Moon Lake only had a fraction of the planet&#39;s were-beast population. Why not flaunt it and show how good it was to be furry?<br />
<br />
But Moon Lake continued to cling to those laws and customs. The paper copy of the handbook that was given to normals was originally written shortly after the town was founded to give the Founders the ability to welcome normals and explain the rules for the town and what these new normals would have the chance to become, but beyond basic definitions and the rules for changing the handbook didn&#39;t make much of a sale on being a were-beast, and now that old handbook made no sense in that regard. She&#39;d seen plenty of stories out there on the internet where people actually fantasized about being a were-beast. Why not advertise it? <br />
<br />
But Moon Lake clung to those old ways blocked her desire to be with William, which lead to the idea to get William and then take him Canada. Since Moon Lake was a US city, they couldn&#39;t be arrested by the Moon Lake police or any US law enforcement agency. They&#39;d also likely lack the resources to track her and William down until after she&#39;d had kits and her claim would win out... The fact that William&#39;s bond was to Martha and that he didn&#39;t love her because of her actions didn&#39;t register on Yvette&#39;s mind. In her mind, Martha had bewitched him somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I&#39;ll need to get the cops on someone else,&quot; Yvette thought to herself as she made her way to the camping area that was near the lake, though not on the lake&#39;s shores.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
While Moon Lake didn&#39;t have a large number of people moving to it on a daily basis and wasn&#39;t listed on many maps, that didn&#39;t mean that the town DIDN&#39;T exist in a sort of bubble. People knew the town existed but didn&#39;t know the full truth about it. Only those who came to Moon Lake learned the truth, though how many were required to become were-beasts depended on how long they intended to stay. Those, like the Andersons, who were moving there to live full time would have to have at least one family member become a were-beast, so that way if the family revealed Moon Lake to humanity, they&#39;d betray their own flesh and blood. Those who were only there to attend college, to work (but lived in a neighboring town), or to enjoy the recreational facilities related to the lake were informed of Moon Lake&#39;s were-beast population after they had signed legal waivers in which they agreed not to tell anyone about the were-beasts they may have met or seen. Some of these guests did become were-beasts from time to time, as if they wanted to become were-beasts, there was no law that said they had to stay human, even if they ultimately wouldn&#39;t live in Moon Lake on a full time basis.<br />
<br />
The Moon Lake Campground was one of those facilities that was there to allow people to come and camp and enjoy the lake. There were walking paths that lead from the campground to a pier for the lake and one that went around some of the hills around the campground. The campground was surrounded by signs that read &quot;Moon Lake Campground: N.&quot; Many people assumed that there were other campgrounds and were grouped by the letters of the alphabet not knowing that that N stood for &quot;Normal.&quot; The camp ground was for normals to enjoy the clean waters of the lake and the area, and with things staying rather warm people were enjoying the campground and what went in it.<br />
<br />
As Yvette made her way into the campground she retained her fox form, even if the rules said she couldn&#39;t. She was quieter in fox form and faster in fox form. And with the morning son still rising, she picked up a pair of familiar scents. They were from a pair of normals that she knew from the college, a young man and a young woman named Harry and Jenny, Yvette had never gotten their last names nor found out if they had grown up in Moon Lake or come only to attend the college. For the moment, she didn&#39;t care. The police would be pursuing her again soon, and she needed a distraction.<br />
<br />
Yvette silently tracked their scents down to a modest sized tent at a camp site with a sedan next to it in the parking space. She could pick up the scent of an burned out campfire and the remains of the chicken that Harry and Jenny had eaten. She also caught the scent of alcohol and guessed that the two had had their own drinking party, typical for college students. A part of her mind wanted to investigate to see if they had left any leftovers, but she needed a distraction and clothes. She approached the tent and her triangular ears could hear two sets of snores coming from inside the tent. As she got closer to the tent, her nose also picked up something else... Harry and Jenny had had sex the night before, and were an apparent item. That only raised jealousy in Yvette. Martha got to enslave her William while chasing the Twists. Her classmates got each other, and while she had tried damn hard to get herself a mate and have kits, she had no one.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not fair,&quot;  Yvette said to herself as she quietly began undoing the zipper that held the tent shut. &quot;It&#39;s not fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither Harry nor Jenny responded and slept on. Yvette noticed two things, first, that both of them were naked and that Jenny&#39;s purse and duffel bag were the closet to her. Yvette figured that this could be her distraction and grabbed the duffel bag, knowing that Jenny would have clothes in it, which had to include clean clothes. And while Jenny was rather flat chested, she was as stall as Yvette in human form. Yvette took the duffel bag and ran a claw along Jenny&#39;s ankle.  Werefoxes generally had dull claws, but there were still sharp enough to break human skin and Yvette left a decent sized cut in Jenny&#39;s ankle, deeper then the one she&#39;d accidentally made in William Anderson. By the time the police arrived in the area following the man&#39;s phone call, Jenny will have begun to change into a werefox and they would have to act to control her and find a way to complete her transformation, giving her time to escape, go through the same means of escaping detection and then put on Jenny&#39;s clothes  to be able to go back into town and claim what she felt was rightfully hers...<br />
<br />
As Yvette ran off,  while the full transformation didn&#39;t begin with Jenny, the wound did heal and some patches of cream colored fur did appear on her. Her dreams also dramatically changed. Instead of being a flat chested human woman throwing pies at a plastic target to win money, there was  an extremely voluptuous werefox vixen based off of the Fennec Fox with its largely cream colored fur coat, is shorter tail when compared with the Red Fox, its wide skull with a shorter, though still narrow muzzle, and massive though still pointed ears... who was also engaged in very sexual acts with a male werefox who seemed to be based off of a Gray Fox with its largely gray/silver body, a black strip from the eyes along the sides of its muzzle to its nose, with tan fur on its neck, chest, belly, arms, inner thighs, lower legs and feet.</p>
