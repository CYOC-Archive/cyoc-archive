<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked at the adorable seven year old girl in front of her. Tricia was the picture of innocence with frizzy black hair and flawless milk chocolate skin. While Tricia seemed accepting of this new reality Katie knew that she would need to change her back. Silently Katie made her wish for Tricia to return to her original age. As Katie watched the diminutive black girl a feeling of dread began to wash over her, Tricia wasn&#39;t growing back up. Katie wished again with still no result, now she began to panic. Quickly she peaked into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Claudia,&quot; she said. &quot;Can I speak to you for a moment.&quot; Claudia nodded and approached Katie. Still holding up her shorts on her diminutive frame Claudia saw the youthful Tricia and gave Katie a puzzled look. &quot;Why is Tricia a kid?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Katie explained the entire situation to Claudia, how Tricia had told Katie about her concerns, how she tried to take the ring and had ended up seven years old again. Claudia took is all in stride and now looked at Katie with a look of concern. &quot;So she tried to take the ring and nows she&#39;s stuck as a seven year old?&quot; She asked. Katie nodded. &quot;This isn&#39;t good Katie.... Is she going to have to grow up all over again?&quot; Katie shrugged and looked at the ring. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; she said. &quot;The ring seems to be very protective of me. If anyone tries to take the ring it protects itself and me. I&#39;ve tried to ask it and the only thing I can get from it is that she&#39;ll be like this until tomorrow night, after that I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia rubbed her chin in thought before looking at Katie. &quot;If Tricia is tuck like this were going to have to look after her,&quot; she said. &quot;One of us is going to have to be the adult. Also were going to need to talk about her age....has she said anything about the fact that she&#39;s only seven and the rest of us are ten?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head. &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Things seem normal to her. She thinks she&#39;s seven but other than that she doesn&#39;t seem to be bothered by the fact we&#39;re older than her.&quot;<br />
<br />
We might want to talk about us becoming younger to match her age,&quot; Claudia sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not thrilled about it but it might make things easier for her. We just need to decide who the adult will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded in agreement. &quot;This is my mess Claudia,&quot; she stated. &quot;You guys should enjoy your Halloween I&#39;ll be the responsible one.&quot; Claudia sighed and smiled. &quot;Thanks Katie,&quot; she said. As Katie was about to make her wish the two girls heard a knock at the door. Puzzled the girls quietly looked out the window to see who it was. &quot;Oh no,&quot; Claudia exclaimed. &quot;What&#39;s she doing here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing at the door was Karen Morgan, the girls fifth grade teacher. Karen was 69 years old with a thin build and salt and pepper hair. The frown on her face seemed to match the deep lines that covered the woman&#39;s face. The girls looked at eachother with worried expressions on their  face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika can you come here for a moment,&quot; Claudia said. Mika walked in with a puzzled look on her face. The Asian girl was dressed in her cat costume and saw the look of concern on Katie and Claudia&#39;s face. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your teacher is at the door,&quot; Claudia exclaimed. &quot;I need you to answer the door. I can&#39;t meet her like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika looked at the door with a worried expression on her face. &quot;Do you know why she&#39;s here?&quot; She asked. Claudia shook her head no. &quot;Find out what she wants. Stall her if she wants to talk with me while Katie and I try to figure things out.&quot; Mika nodded before looking at the seven year old girl playing with one of Mika&#39;s dolls. &quot;Why is Tricia a little girl?&quot; She asked. Katie sighed. &quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ll tell you about it in a moment, just talk with Ms. Morgan for now.&quot; Mika nodded and headed towards the front door.<br />
<br />
Katie and Claudia listened as Mika answered the door and began to talk with their teacher. Although they couldn&#39;t quite make out what they were saying they could tell that Ms. Morgan sounded annoyed, whatever the two were going to do they would need to do it quickly. Suddenly Claudia&#39;s face lit up. &quot;Katie I&#39;ve got an idea,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Why don&#39;t you make Ms. Morgan seven. This way Tricia has a friend and the rest of us won&#39;t need to become younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie liked the idea. Although she had agreed to be an adult it was something she wasn&#39;t looking forward to. &quot;Sounds like a good idea, but what about someone being an adult?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could always call your mom or Samantha&#39;s,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Hell we could call them up anyway and regress them if we wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded and thought about her options. She would go through Ms. Morgans regression but then she would have to decide about whether to call Kellie or Judy. If she did call them should she regress them and do as she said by being the adult. While not an appealing option she did promise.  For now she needed to make Ms. Morgan a kid, silently Katie made her wish.<br />
<br />
Karen felt a tingle as she stood in the doorway. Thinking it was nothing more than a cold breeze she looked down at the young girl in front of her. &quot;I need to speak with your grandmother.&quot; She said. Mika gulped and invited her teacher into her home. &quot;She&#39;s getting ready to take us out trick or treating.&quot; She stammered. &quot;You can wait for her in the living room if you want.&quot; <br />
<br />
Karen nodded and entered the home, not realizing she had already regressed to her early sixties. &quot;Thank you Mika,&quot; she said coldly. Looking around the home Karen was impressed. The house was tastefully decorated and appealed to her sense of style. Taking a seat in a comfy chair Karen looked over at Mika and noticed the look of concern on Mika&#39;s face. Karen didn&#39;t want to say it but her visit wasn&#39;t a bad thing. She wanted to talk to Claudia about placing Mika in some more advanced classes. In the forty plus years she had been teaching she had never had a group of girls that were as intelligent and mature as Mika and her friends. While she had originally thought they were cheating she had found no evidence. Now she was going home to home to talk to the girls guardians about placing them in advanced classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell your grandmother it&#39;s important,&quot; a now 59 year old Karen said. Mika nodded and quickly left the room. Karen smiled, although she knew her students feared her she did have a soft spot for them. She tried to instill a sense of discipline in her students, in her opinion well behaved students were better students. She had tried being more friendly with her students in the beginning of her career but found they tried to take advantage of the situation, squandering the gifts they naturally had.<br />
<br />
Sighing the now fifty year old teacher looked at her reflection. She was slightly surprised but what she saw. Her face seemed less tired than usual and their seemed to be more black than gray in her hair. Believing it to be a trick of her mind Karen shrugged and continued to gaze at the decor in the living room.<br />
<br />
Mika ran to Claudia and Katie with a look of concern on her face. &quot;She wants to talk to you Claudia,&quot; she said. Katie and Claudia smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Mika,&quot; Katie said pointing at Karen. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need to worry about her for too much longer.&quot; Puzzled Mika looked back at her teacher and smiled. From their vantage point the girls could see Karen regressing without being seen.<br />
<br />
Karen had left her fifties and had reentered her forties. The woman was attractive with dark hair, a cury build and smooth skin. The fine lines around her eyes were slowly vanishing and her large d cup breasts were beginning to rise. As she reentered her thirties her beauty was beginning to shine through. Karen had a pretty and kind looking face with crystal blue eyes. The grey in her hair was gradually disappearing revealing a very attractive woman of 35.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow she&#39;s really pretty,&quot; Mika commented. &quot;Wonder why she is so mean,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Maybe it has something to do with her childhood. Guess we get to find out tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls smiled as Karen reentered her twenties. Karen was feeling more energetic as she becam 29. Her flawless alabaster skin and long black hair glowed with youthful energy. The young teacher smiled as she stared at some of the pictures around the house. In her mind she had been a teacher for a five years now and loved what she did. Karen thought back at how painfully shy she had been as a child and it had been her teachers who helped bring her out of her shell. Now she wanted to do the same for her students.<br />
<br />
As Karen became 25 her body continued to change. The slacks she wore appeared tight on her firm and curvy legs. The blouse and cardigan she wore loosened around her trim waist but swelled around her massive breasts that continued to rise. Karen had been told that she was an attractive girl but she never felt like that. She was such a wallflower and only felt comfortable when studying. As the girl became 24 she shook her head, she had not thought about her childhood in quite awhile. Brushing her black hair out of her face she noticed a teddy bear on the floor and smiled. Her parents had been very poor and she could never afford much. One of the few toys she did have was a teddy bear similar to the one now lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
A now 22 year old Karen stood up and walked to the bear lying in the middle of the room. Karen was surprised at how loose her pants were in the waist. Karen smiled and hugged the bear close to her chest. Looking around the girl was confused. She had come here to talk with Mika&#39;s grandmother about her daughter but couldn&#39;t understand why. She was only a student teacher at this point and had been told it wasn&#39;t her business to get this involved with her students. Still she believed that it was her duty to provide the best opportunity for her kids no matter what her bosses had to say.<br />
<br />
Mika, Claudia, and Katie watched as Karen began her slow descent through college. The dark haired girl was attractive with dark hair, pale skin and beautiful eyes. The girls watched as Karens curves began to slowly melt away. Soon a high school senior of 18 stood in the living room with a confused look on her face.<br />
<br />
Karen blinked and looked around the room. This place seemed familiar but she couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. Karen rubbed her eyes and took her contacts out of her eyes. Karen wondered why she was wearing these things, the idea of placing something in her eye grossed her out. Reaching into her purse she eventually found her glasses and put them on. The 17 year old felt better pushing the glasses up her nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know she wore glasses,&quot; Mika said in awe as she watched the girl begin to shrink. The girls watched as the Karen went from 17 to 16. Karen was beginning to shrink and lose the assets puberty had blessed her with. Her face was taking on an innocent look and her curves were beginning to melt away. Her formerly large d cup breasts had been reduced to a pair of b cups. What was most surprising was Karens body language. Karen was losing the confidence she had as an adult. Clenching her shoulders and lowering her head the shy dark haired girl now found herself looking more at the floor than at the walls. The girl was a intimidated at the thought of talking with Mika&#39;s grandma. She had agreed to babysit Mika and her friends but felt she would be more comfortable in her room with a nice book.<br />
<br />
As Karen became 15 she hugged Mika&#39;s bear closer to her chest as if it would provide her with a sense of security. As Karen became 14 and left high school she began to shift from one foot to the other. Her nervous actions caused her slacks to lose hold of there tenuous grip on her narrow hips and fall to the floor. The 14 year old gave a high pitched squeak and tried to pull the slacks back up her coltish legs. Her awkwardness caused the young girl to fall to the floor causing her slacks and shoes to fall off.<br />
<br />
Now 13 Karen clumsily got to her feet and rubbed her head. The girl was now barefoot with her coltish legs exposed. Karen alabaster skin turned a scarlet red as she tried to cover herself. Removing the cardigan that half covered her hands she wrapped it around her waist like a make shift skirt. As Karen left her teens and became 12 tears began to well up in her eyes. The skinny girl was embarrassed. In her mind she had embarrassed herself in from of her only friends. Although they were younger than her they were the only girls that treated her with respect. Hugging her small breasts the girl sat down and drew her thin legs to her chest and began to cry softly. <br />
<br />
Katie, Claudia and Mika saw Karen continue to cry as she became 11. Karen had left all signs of puberty behind and was now just a skinny girl with dark hair and an innocent face. The girls felt sorry for the girl as they watched her become ten. Karen continued to shrink and was now the same size as Mary Elise. Unlike Mary Elise though this girl was painfully shy, drawing looks of pity from the girls.<br />
<br />
Karens cries continued as she reentered the single digits of her life. Karen looked up wiping her nose on the sleeves of her blouse, which now completely covered her hands. Karen was scared now as she became 8. She didn&#39;t recognize this place and began to wonder why she was her and why she was dressed in an overly large blouse. Standing up the girls regression ended at seven. Karen adjusted her glasses and hugged herself as she looked around the room. Her blouse now rested just past her knees and the sleeves went several inches past her hands. The girl had a frightened look on her face as she shyly looked around the room. &quot;Hello,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Is anyone there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie stepped forward with a look of pity on her face. &quot;Hi there,&quot; she said kindly. Karen withdrew slightly from the older girl adjusting her overly large glasses. &quot;Who are you.&quot; She asked shyly trying to avert eye contact. &quot;My names Katie. I&#39;m guessing your must be Karen.&quot; <br />
<br />
Karen nodded her head and gazed down at the floor. Katie smiled and placed hand on the small girls shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m so glad your here,&quot; she said. &quot;We were about to go trick or treating with our friend Tricia, she seven. How old are you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m seven,&quot; Karen whispered. &quot;I&#39;ve never gone trick or treating with friends before. Most people think I&#39;m weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled. &quot;Well we don&#39;t think your weird,&quot; she said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you come join us for dinner before we go out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen gave a slight nod and slowly walked towards the kitchen. Now Katie had to decide her next move.</p>
