<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Apart from you telling me a bit of your heritage,” Douglas speaking with a Darrell snuggly sleeping next to him as they watched a show of two ‘scientists’ test ‘theories’ but in the end blow stuff up; “I don’t exactly know much about you Joan.”<br />
“To be honest,” Joan sighing; “there really isn’t much to speak of. At least past wise,” Joan stretching as she gets up to get a glass of water; “I did spend most of my life in Burbank. I met Alyssa by pure chance at a club a friend dragged me to. Smelling another were for the first time was like being hit by lighting,” Joan sitting back down; making sure not to sit on her tail. “We talked for a bit; I was a little reserved in revealing my true self to Alyssa, but-“<br />
“My cousin can be insistent,” Douglas shaking his head; “please go on.”<br />
“Alyssa and I struck a friendship,” Joan speaking as her were-tiger tail absently twitches, tickling Darrell as it gently hits his face; “I find out a few days later she is pregnant.” Joan looking at the sleeping kid next to Douglas; “with this bundle of energy. I was attending college at the time; studying to become an electrical engineer. I took a part time job as waitress to help pay for my tuition and other expenses. There is only so much a scholarship can get you.”<br />
“Did you complete your courses,” Douglas asking.<br />
“Like I said,” Joan sighing; “there is only so much a scholarship can take you now a days. I had to drop out, because Alyssa needed help taking care of Darrell and asked me to move in. I had every intention of going back to finishing my school work to earn my bachelor’s degree, but with Alyssa’s crazy work schedule, I wasn’t able to make time to head back to school.”<br />
“You know,” Douglas responding; “if you still have your course transcripts, you might consider transferring to Moon Lake College. I’m not sure if the council would be able to help alleviate some of the cost involved, but they can help in cutting through some of the red tape.”<br />
“Tachibana already told me about that,” Joan answering; “as for money, I think Alyssa left some for me. That storage locker we plan on visiting tomorrow; her letter mentioned a little something there for me.”<br />
“Do you want to take care of that first,” Douglas asking; “lets not forget you want to check out Awareness and I’m taking Darrell to the rec center so he can swim in a fresh water pool.”<br />
“Sounds like a plan,” Joan yawning; “but not until after breakfast.”<br />
<br />
Douglas looks on as Joan nods off. Seeing that Darrell is fast asleep next to him; Douglas wraps his arm around the kid ensuring he doesn’t get cold while he turns the volume down on the tv and switches it to the nightly news.<br />

<br />
Brian Walker was finishing up his first day working at the Elder council building. After informing his were-horse supervisor Steve that the issue stemming from the second floor security card readers is not computer related but either electrical or possibly faulty equipment. Brian was tasked with helping to mop up the council chambers. Seeing the were-beaver that caught his eye earlier made him smile as she keeps raising her flat tail whenever she catches him staring at him. With a group of several custodial employees; Brian found that cleaning the dimly lit council chamber took a mere twenty minutes. With the task done and the work completed; Brian heading into the common area, takes his phone out a looks at the picture of Patricia’s tail once again. Finding the flat and hairless appendage to be quite alluring; he smiles as he smells the were-beaver in question behind him.<br />
<br />
“So you do like what you see,” She smiles.<br />
“Well,” Brian turning around; “it is one hell of a way to introduce yourself.”<br />
“And since you already know my name Brain,” Patricia smiling; “it saves on having to go through the usual small talk.”<br />
“And you other text,” Brian asking; “you meant wanting me to make you feel full and complete?”<br />
“You’re not interested,” Patricia looking concerned.<br />
“On the contrary,” Brian smiling; “I am extremely interested, but I hardly know you.”<br />
“What is there to know,” Patricia speaking; “I’m a girl, you’re a boy and we are clearly attracted to each other.”<br />
“No argument there,” Brian speaking; “I’m referring getting to know each other on a non-sexual level. You know, were are you from, family and all those other conversation starters.”<br />
“Oh,” Patricia answering; “I guess that&#39;s fair. To start with, my family is originally from Canada; Fort Vermillion in Alberta to be precise. My mother and father are also were-beavers and I’m sixteen years old and will be attending Moon Lake high after the Christmas holidays.”<br />
“Fourteen years old here,” Brian answering; “and I’m a naturally born were-otter.”<br />
“We moved here,” Patricia answering; &quot;because my father works for Knight Industries and was asked to transfer to the head office here in Moon Lake for his promotion as head of environmental sustainment.”<br />
A tree hugger?” Brian giggling.<br />
“As a were-beaver,” Patricia chuckling; “it comes naturally. So what about you?”<br />
<br />
Brian goes on to explain that he has lived in Moon Lake since he was born. He is a junior at Moon Lake high. Brian chooses to leave out the part that his father left him and his mother when he was four and that Emily works two jobs just to support them, as well as the reason as to why he is working at the council building.<br />
“Can I ask you a question,” Brian finishing giving Patricia a quick bio of himself; “how did you get my phone number?”<br />
“Your were-cat friend gave it to me,” Patricia answering as Brain looks on stunned; “She also said you were great in the sack.”<br />
“Were-cat friend,” Brain looks on confused; “did she tell you her name?”<br />
“Nope,” Patricia answering; “only that she lived in Seattle and that your age difference wouldn’t work for any long term relationship. Oh she did have black fur if that helps”<br />
“Okay,” Brian realizing that Patricia just described Betty; wondering why she is in town, Brian will just have to wait until he gets home before seeing if there is any messages waiting for him on his secret cellphone.<br />
Oh,” Brain speaking as the two are about to head into separate alcoves to defur and get dressed; “can we make it ten in the morning tomorrow by the lake? My mother might have chores for me before she heads off to work.”<br />
“Works for me,” Patricia answering.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later; Andrew Curtis pulls up to Brain and Emily’s house. Brian seeing his mom home from her second job already; he wonders if he is going to get into trouble for being home late.<br />
“Don’t worry Brian,” Andrew speaking; “I told her you might be late coming home with your after school job.”<br />
Brain feeling some comfort with what Andrew just said; he opens the door and enters with Andrew behind him. Seeing his mother waiting for him in the kitchen smiling, further sets him at ease. With Andrew present; Brian begins to tell his mother the day he had at the council building and meeting a new girl.</p>
