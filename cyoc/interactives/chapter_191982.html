<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he was about to leave for work, he stopped at the doorknob.<br />
<br />
No, he would not wait another day while the Dominion Core was imprisoned. He would act now and find a way to free it. <br />
<br />
Adam numbered his place of occupation, an office where he worked as an accountant, and called in sick, citing symptoms like that of the pandemic virus that had still been going on. <br />
<br />
After joining the Dominion he saw no real purpose in working other than to keep appearances and make ends meet, but small glimpses of his former life existed within his mind, and a pang of guilt at lying resided in his mind, but he ignored that feeling, when the Dominion was freed none of his past worries would matter.<br />
<br />
With some hesitation, he dismissed his latex form, finding his exposed human form to be much more uncomfortable than when he was fully coated in latex.<br />
<br />
Locking his apartment door he took a walk to the local city park and pondered who his target should be. <br />
<br />
He had earned a few looks as he made his way there, since he was storing a secondary bulge, in his human form the only place where he could store it was in his own bulge, effectively doubling its size and making it much more obvious, even when wearing pants.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t care about the looks however, and simply minded his own business.<br />
<br />
He walked around for an hour or so, enjoying the solitude, it was still early in the day so he effectively had the entire park to himself.<br />
<br />
Yet even with this peace and quiet he could still not quite manage to figure out who to recruit to his cause. He wish he could reach out to the Dominion or other Drones, but they were too far away, too distant for him to connect with.<br />
<br />
Then he heard it. The chirping melody of a bird song. So peaceful, so pure, just like how he had felt when he first joined the Dominion. Before his life as a Drone, such music fell deaf upon his ears, too concerned with the burden of modern human life, but now, Adam found it to be wonderous.<br />
<br />
The sound came from a blue bird perched onto the branch of a nearby tree. Its blue and white feathers ruffled as it groomed itself. It payed no attention to Adam, even as he reached into the inside of his pants, and groped his large null bulge, feeling the second bulge he carried plop into his hand into the shape of a dark black latex orb, more or less the size of his fist.<br />
<br />
It was time to experiment. Mimicing the throwing pose from a certain monster catching anime that was popular from the kids, he threw the bulge ball at the bluebird, waiting for the exact moment where it visions was focused elsewhere. The bulge ball hit the bluebird dead on with accuracy Adam could never have achieved in his previous life.<br />
<br />
The bird let out a high pitched screek as it landed onto the ground, the null bulge enveloping it.<br />
<br />
Adam inched closer as the null bulge began to explore the surface of its new host.<br />
<br />
Adam was curious as to what would happen. Considering the null bulge was nearly the size of the bird itself, how would the bulge work with such a small host?<br />
<br />
Adam watched keenly as he saw portions of the bulge&#39;s latex begin to slither into the bird through every orfice it could find, pumping more and more of itself into the struggling, resisting bird until all that was left was a small ball that rested directly over where Adam believed the bird&#39;s cloaca was located. If he squinted he could see the formation of the Dominion&#39;s symbol form over the cloaca bulge.<br />
<br />
Adam suddenly felt a shock of euphoria so hard he nearly collapsed onto the ground, barely being able to keep himself steady on one knee as the pleasure flooded his body. A sensation nearly as powerful as when he was first converted flooded his body. <br />
<br />
A flood of information filled him as a new link was established between him and the bird. Memories of hatching from an egg, of being fed by its, no, his mother, and when he first learned to fly. The sharing of memories and information was even greater than when he was converted, likely due to the intense proximity he was with the new convert. What would it be like when the Dominion was freed? Would the influx of memories overflow his mortal body, would he ascend to an even higher peak? He had to find out. But for now he attempted to recover from what he just experienced. His own bulge throbbed pleasurably and if he was capable of doing so he would have orgasmed numerous times from that one instance of conversion alone.<br />
<br />
The bird twitched and spasmed on the ground, its eyes blinking wildly as Adam fondly remembered how he felt when he was first converted. What would it be like for a bird, for an animal whose being was so tiny, whose worldview was so limited to be flooded with concepts that were once utterly incomprehensible to it? <br />
<br />
If Adam spent a week in such a state, the bird would definitely take longer. But Adam would do his best to nurture it for now.<br />
<br />
Gently, he grabbed the bird with both hands and concealed it in the pocket of his jacket as he made his way home.<br />
<br />
He was worried that with the fall it had suffered, it would have experienced some harsh injuries, but something told him in his mind that the null bulge would easily take care of such mortal shortcomings like injuries and disease. <br />
<br />
When he arrived home, Adam prepared a bed pillow and made a small little bunk for the bird inside a small cardboard box he had laying around.<br />
<br />
The bird wasn&#39;t moving as eratically anymore, and to an unenlightend observer, they might even assume it was death, but Adam knew better.<br />
<br />
Thus, Adam spent the next four months nurturing the bird. Attending his account job as if nothing was wrong while in his spare time researching the G.E.T organization as discretely as he could, as well as attempting to connect with his fellow Drones. <br />
<br />
Although he had not managed to fully establish a link, he could feel his brethern&#39;s feelings of celebration and happiness at the new converstion of a fellow drone. An accomplishment he took pride in.<br />
<br />
It was when he was working that he had felt his new drone brother fully awaken from his stupor. It was when he was at. Standing up from his chair so adruptly, it had caused his coworkers to jump slightly as he saw him rush to his manager&#39;s office, citing that there was a family emergency and that he would have to leave early.<br />
<br />
The bus ride home was agonizingly long as he got off the bus as fast as he could and practically ran towards his apartment. Unlocking his appartment door, he entered his dimly lit apartment.<br />
<br />
Inside the kitchen area was a humanoid figure, a Drone. It was the bird. In a form much resembling an anthropomorphic bird creature, the null bulge had dramatically altered its body whilst in drone form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... fellow Drone of the Dominion.&quot; The bird Drone spoke in a warm loving voice. Although it was its first time speaking, it spoke as if it had known the language its entire life.<br />
<br />
Adam locked the door behind him and shed his human clothing. Taking on his drone form as he walked slowly towards his Dominion brother, as if he wasn&#39;t quite sure it was real.<br />
<br />
The two figures embraced, null bulges rubbing passionately against eachother as the sharing of information between them commenced, filling them both with pleasure. <br />
<br />
Their bodies throbbed and their bulges were driving them wild as the sensitivity of their privates made every second filled with burning hot pleasure.<br />
<br />
Now that he had a Dominion brother, they could get to work.</p>
