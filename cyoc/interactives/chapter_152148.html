<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tina could see Jenny&#39;s eyes going blank for a second before they refocused. She had no chance to open her mouth before Jenny asked: &quot;Why aren´t you working, Tina? You see how messy my room is. I will go watch tv while you clean it. And remember your other tasks.&quot; And with that she vanished out of the door of her room.<br />
Tim would have stood there, mouth agape, if the maid mind-set in him would have let him, but so she was compelled to follow Jenny&#39;s orders and started cleaning. She gathered the scattered, dirty clothes, taking notice that some looked like boys clothes. &quot;Has Jemmy now a boyfriend or only someone for a sleepover who has forgotten some things?&quot; Then he found something that belonged to him some time ago. It hasn´t changed, so it belonged to someone other now or it would have changed alongside him.<br />
When Tina had gathered everything she brought it over to the laundry baskets in the bathroom, sorting it in them. Then he got the dirty clothes of Jenny&#39;s parents out of their bedroom and also sorted them. Seeing the basket for white clothes was nearly full the maid took it out to put it in the washing machine before starting it.<br />
She returned to Jenny&#39;s room with cleaning supplies and started with dusting everything. Afterwards she vacuumed the carpet and made the bed.<br />
The whole time Tim was cursing Jenny mentally. He couldn´t disobey the cleaning orders even when he knows he was set to 85% obedience, not that he hadn´t tried to do so. When the maid took a breath after having finished the bed Tim made a new attempt and was able to overcome her. &quot;I have to be quick before I get a new order.&quot; he thought.<br />
Moving was slow to Tim, but he reached the computer and started the game again. He hadn´t even noticed that Jenny had closed it. It booted slower than Tim had hoped, but he was finally able to select himself. On his way through the options he quickly changed his gender back, which in turn transformed his maid outfit into a smoking fit for a butler or a servant, but just as the cursor was on the obedience bar he heard the washing machine beep. Before he could change the bar his body moved away from the computer to get the laundry.<br />
It took him about ten minutes to get the clothes hanging outside. His now servant-self took the basket back to the bathroom and then put the next clothes into start washing again. With a sigh the servant started cleaning the bathroom and Tim was unable to get his control back for another hour. In this time he cleaned the toilet, sink, shower and the bathtub spotless and mopped the floor.<br />
Like before he was able to overpower the servant mindset when it took a breath for finishing the bathroom and with a quick look to the washing machine he moved back to Jenny&#39;s room. He had about ten minutes before the machine would be finished again, so he had to be quick to stop himself from loosing control again before it beeped.<br />
But he was out of luck shortly after. He had just sat down in front of the computer and moved the mouse when Jenny came into the room. &quot;What are you doing at my computer, Tim? You aren´t allowed to use it without asking.&quot; she commanded angry at him. Tim tried to move the obedience bar, but with Jenny&#39;s order he quickly moved away from the computer. &quot;Sorry, I just wanted to look for something quick, mistress Jenny.&quot; He answered fearful of what Jenny would do now.<br />
Inside Tim was screaming, he had been so close and now his servant mind-set would hinder him to get at Jenny&#39;s computer, making it nearly impossible for him to change back. But that wasn´t the last of it. Jenny moved over to the computer to see what Tim had done. She didn´t know what had changed, but could see where the cursor was hovering. &quot;What would you look up in that game, Tim? Do you think the game character modeled after you should be less obedient?&quot;<br />
Tim answered hesitant: &quot;I thought so, yes mistress.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I see it the other way. A good servant should be as obedient as possible. I will need to readjust this setting.&quot; Before Tim had any chance to stop her, Jenny slide the obedience bar up to 100%, something his friend wouldn´t have done before he toggled his own awareness. Now it would be impossible for Tim to access the computer alone due the earlier comment, and it didn´t seem as Jenny saw him as a friend anymore, so asking for it wouldn´t work wither. Tim could only hope that Jenny made herself aware again and would correct this mess.<br />
Jenny didn´t realize the change as she was still unaware, but changed a bit more about the servant. She added to his attributes to be more polite, honest and loyal before hitting save. Then she saw a slide bar she found interesting. &quot;Look, there is even a bar for your cooking skills. A servant should be able to cook better than that, don´t you think Tim?&quot; she asked him.<br />
Tim had known he couldn´t cook and wouldn´t mind it if Jenny adjusted it a bit, but on the other side Jenny shouldn´t change more. But the servant answered for him: Yes, a servant should be able to cook. I´m sorry my skills aren´t as good as you would like, mistress Jenny.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well then, at least in the game the servant should be able to cook better.&quot; With that said Jenny slide the bar from &quot;bad&quot; to &quot;really good&quot;, the second highest possible option and hit save again. She then closed the program and moved to the door. &quot;Now continue your work Tim. And don´t forget, you aren´t allowed to use that computer without asking, and the game is mine, you mustn´t concern yourself with it.&quot; Then she vanished out of the door again.<br />
Tim screamed mentally again. Jenny had forbidden the use of the game, so even if he could ask to use the computer he couldn´t change himself with it. And he had seen the honest part, so he wouldn´t be able to lie with that either. While the servant reacted to the beeping washing machine, Tim realized that he was now a prisoner in his own body for as long as Jenny didn´t correct his mistakes.<br />
And so Tim&#39;s day went by. After the hanging of the second laundry he cleaned the parents bedroom before he started making dinner. After dinner was served he cleaned the kitchen. He was then sent to his room and dully noticed that before the changes this had been a small storage room. Shortly after he went to bed, hoping that this nightmare would end soon. He wasn´t even angry at Jenny anymore. He had enough time to realize that most of this was his own fault for letting Jacob be changed and then turn him unaware.<br />
The next days went on similar. Tim would make breakfast and went to school with Jenny, only he was now more isolated due his servant job. After school he changed into &quot;working&quot; mode and cleaned and washed inside or worked in the garden until he made dinner. After cleaning the kitchen he went to his room, made his homework before going to bed.<br />
Jenny didn´t use the game for several weeks, as she wasn´t interested at the moment. She had gained a liking in her servant, something she hadn´t thought about before he started working for them. Maybe she would make him her lover in the game later, just to see how it would work out in-game.</p>
