<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty followed Markie and Dustin to Dustin&#39;s room as June was searching for a thermometer. Markie had Dustin undressed and securely tied down in a few seconds and was whispering words of comfort while examining his body for anything that could be causing his strange behavior. <br />
<br />
&quot;Markie?&quot; Ty said, &quot;Dustin doesn&#39;t seem to be in any immediate danger, do you mind if I talk with him for a few moments alone, to jog his memory?&quot;<br />
<br />
The big gay behemoth looked from Ty to Dustin to Ty again. &quot;Oh, I thupoth, but I&#39;ll be right back when June-i-poo finds the thermometer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Markie double checked the restraints and walked out the door, shutting it behind him. Ty immediately made a silent wish that both Markie and June will forget that Dustin behaved strangely when he came home, and as far as they remember, Dustin went upstairs to work on homework.<br />
<br />
Ty sat down next to Dustin on the bed, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they will leave you alone until you go downstairs so long as you don&#39;t scream. Can I trust you not to scream?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded yes, and Ty removed the gag.<br />
<br />
It was at this moment Ty decided that he would rather play innocent and watch Dustin&#39;s punishment unfold slowly. <br />
<br />
Dustin, now ungagged immediately had a ton of questions, &quot;Whats going on? Who&#39;s that guy? Where&#39;s my dad? Why aren&#39;t you crazy like the rest of them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s reference to &quot;my dad&quot; not &quot;our dad&quot; made Ty that much more sure of what he was going to do. Drumming up all his strength Ty summoned tears to his eyes and put on one hell of a performance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am crazy Dustin.&quot; Ty looked at Dustin as a tear rolled down his cheek.<br />
<br />
Dustin was again horrified and Ty stifled a smile as the blood ran out of Dustin&#39;s face. &quot;W-What do you mean Ty?&quot; he squeaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hard for me to remember, but I think it all happened last night. Markie... I mean Mark sent me out to get the mail because I forgot it earlier in the day. I don&#39;t remember anything else strange but that doesnt mean it didnt happen. When I woke up I was 17 but I look about 20. I still remember being 15 yesterday but its easier for me to remember my girlfriends favorite song or pre-calculus class.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty was really trying to sell the emotional turmoil, Dustin was left feeling awkward wanting to know what else happened but not knowing how to work with his seemingly, emotionally unstable brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I woke up late this morning, You and Mom must have already left. I went downstairs in my boxers and Markie, or Mark was there making a late breakfast and turning into Markie. I watched as his hair changed color and his muscles grew, I saw the years melt away from him. It was amazing to watch. I knew that the same thing that was happening to me, happened to him, for some reason it happened to him faster. Maybe it was because he was doing his houseboy thing, I probably wont be me once I go on a date with my girlfriend or play football or something. Marks new life revolves around taking care of the house, he did that and became what you see downstairs. When he noticed me he told me to get dressed unless I wanted him to loose himself over my physique. To be objectified by your former foster father, gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went back up to my room in a hurry and found that all my clothes had changed into clothes my new body could fit. So I went back downstairs and asked him all sorts of questions about who Markie is. Then mom came home, she looked like she was ready to start dinner but Markie had already done that. As soon as she saw him she forgot Mark existed and she never mentioned my growth spurt to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still acting, Ty looked sadly as Dustin, still strapped down. Ty made his wish to slowly set the ball in motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you walked in. I can remember things that I know arent real, I look at you and it seems normal to see you this way but I know everything is all messed up.&quot; Ty stood up and silently wished all the family pictures would change to how Dustin would soon be. Ty picked one up and carried it over to the bed. Dustin, I know you are my foster brother but its hard for me to think of you as anything but Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Ty turned the family picture to show him his soon to be future. Ty&#39;s silent wish from a few moments ago took hold at the trigger word of being called Dad and Dustin&#39;s mind was filled with conflicting memories and more importantly habits. Each time Dustin did something uncharacteristic of a 16 year old he would become more and more the 46 year old business man, father, husband of June, physically and mentally. The rest of the world will see him as a the adult he will become despite his current physical appearance.<br />
<br />
Ty was careful about the life Dustin was going to fall into, Dustin will immediately become bisexual needing attention from both Markie and June to be fulfilled. He will slowly take on characteristics to make him an Iron-fisted businessman at work, a romantic at home, and an easy going father to Ty. Some of the first changes are going to be not noticing he is doing anything strange unless he is questioned about it and after he starts getting into his new routine he won&#39;t remember his old life unless he is looking at his unfamiliar reflection. Then, when he is fully changed, he wont remember his old life unless Ty wants him to. He will be happy, wealthy, and sexually satisfied.<br />
<br />
Ty untied Dustin who was sobbing, he immediately curled into the fetal position. Ty went into the bathroom and pulled out the shaving cream, and got ready for his first shave. Dustin came out a moment later and asked me why I was shaving at this time.<br />
<br />
Ty continued the farce, &quot;I don&#39;t want to fight it anymore. It is bad enough that Mark and June no longer exist as we knew them, but now you too? I am not going to live in madness.&quot; With that Ty began shaving and Dustin fell to the floor weeping again realizing he will be the only one to notice as his life slips into chaos. When Ty finished he wiped himself down and admired himself in the mirror. When Dustin made a loudish sob, Ty pretended to notice him for the first time and rushed to his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad? Dad! What&#39;s the matter Dad? Should I get Mom or Markie? Should I take you to your room?&quot; Ty made a silent wish that Dustin&#39;s room was now Markie&#39;s and Dustin slept with June.<br />
<br />
&quot;TY!&quot; Dustin yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Dad?&quot; Ty feigned confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the only one, and you left me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I&#39;m right here! Nobody left you. I&#39;m right here.&quot; Ty picked up Dustin&#39;s scrawny 13 year old body and placed him on the master bed. &quot;Dad, I think you took a nap and are having a night terror, it will be ok, just rest here, Ill have Mom come check you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty left to get Mom while willing Dustin&#39;s new role to take hold on them completely. Dustin rested on the bed and felt a nice warm feeling radiate out from his stomach/ groin area. all of this seemed more normal and not terrible at all. By the time everyone made it back to the master bedroom Dustin was dressed and apologizing for causing alarm, Ty noticed that he seemed closer to 14 or 15 than the 13 he was a few moments ago.<br />
<br />
Ty then realized that sleeping in the master bedroom is for the adult of the house or their small children when the adult is present... not for a 16 year old and thus, the first change in Dustin was triggered.</p>
