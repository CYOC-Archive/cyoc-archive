<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as the thirteen teens got back to Luke&#39;s house, they were surprised to find the door open--and broken.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...?!&quot; Luke cried in alarm.<br />
<br />
The gang rushed inside, and found the whole place ransacked. All the furniture was turned over and broken, the pictures on the wall crooked and fallen, and so on. The group looked through everything to see if anything had been stolen: it seemed to Luke that nothing from downstairs had been taken. Brian, Nick, Kevin, Dean, Allan, and Zack stayed downstairs to straighten up the place while the seven others went upstairs to investigate. The quadruplets took care of searching most of the rooms: the master bedroom, the bathroom, etc. Luke and the twins went into his own bedroom--and found the room relatively as he had left it. Although there was some evidence that someone had been in the room during the day, there was nothing broken or miss--<br />
<br />
Then, Luke noticed it: the conjoined twins suit was gone!<br />
<br />
Word spread to the others quickly, and soon they all gathered in the ruins of the living room, wondering who could have stolen the suit. Mikey suggested Ethan and Scott, but Donnie pointed out that they would not have destroyed the house. Raph, Kevin, and Dean suggested someone from the school, but the boys had kept their secret so well that it would be impossible for any of their classmates to have come looking for clues. As the others were thinking and about to offer new theories, a noise came from the basement: they were not alone.<br />
<br />
Luke and Max volunteered to investigate while the others went upstairs to look for the suit again--maybe it was just misplaced, and whoever the thief was did not take it. They quietly opened the door and peered down. Nothing down the stairs. The two quietly crawled down to see through the railing, and stopped when they saw a figure. It was not just any figure: it was a massive, muscular man with three different heads! The body and heads were covered in what looked like face and body paint. The head at the left shoulder was yellow with some kind of brace or something under his chin. The one at the right shoulder was red with dreadlocks and had some mask covering some of his face around the eyes. The middle head was blue like the rest of the body, and seemed to have one eye inside some kind of visor. The three heads each had some kind of large, bronze ring under each of their necks, almost making it look as if they were not originally attached to the body. The chest and upper body was wide and buff, and the arms and hands were massive as well. From the waist down, the body was a bit narrower, but still well built and with massive legs and feet. The body was also wearing some brown armor over the left shoulder, upper back, and chest. There was some bronze armor over the right shoulder, as well as some king of fingerless gauntlet on the right hand. It didn&#39;t look like brown pants over the legs, but there was something covering them, and there were some kind of pads over the knees and brown boots as well. They looked like a wrestler that the guys remembered from some old TV show.<br />
<br />
The body was moving, and the three heads were each acting: three heads fully coordinated on one body? Then it struck Luke and Max: this was three guys, and they were wearing the stolen suit underneath all that stuff! What Luke wondered is how they could be so easily coordinated as conjoined triplets, and why their look seemed so professional and familiar. It was as if they had been conjoined siblings before, possibly several times...<br />
<br />
Neither of the boys had time to wonder, because there was someone groaning down there, outside of their sight. Luke went down a little further and saw the basement couch--and the Santa that had given him the suit in the first place, bloody and beaten! Luke was too afraid to move any further; thankfully, no one down there could see him or Max.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sure feels good to be back, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; said the blue head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! And I wanna put the hurt on that guy again!&quot; the red head smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurt, shirt, dirt, giraffe,&quot; the yellow head laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; groaned the Santa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet, Kringle!&quot; the blue said snapped. &quot;You deserve this for taking away our gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke was confused at that: their gift?<br />
<br />
The three heads--it&#39;s not clear who exactly did it--put their right hand over Santa&#39;s mouth, and soon enough, he passed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to get back to pounding those gutless cowards into paste!&quot; the red head said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stick to the plan,&quot; the blue head said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paste is sticky!&quot; the yellow head smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; the red head snapped. &quot;I wanna break stuff!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I want to make lots of money!&quot; the blue head argued.<br />
<br />
Luke was beginning to notice a pattern between the heads: the red head seemed to be nothing but rage and anger, the blue one a level-headed brainiac, and the yellow one--well, definitely something.<br />
<br />
Luke and Max decided to crawl back upstairs before the three heads noticed that they were being watched. As soon as they got up to the downstairs hallway, Max noticed a shadow moving towards the stairs: they were coming! Luke quickly but quietly closed the door and the two slipped into the nearby bathroom. They did not turn on the light, but they did leave the door open a little so that they could see. They saw the three-headed wrestler come up from the basement, and run straight towards the front door, out into the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; Max whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Luke said, &quot;but I think we&#39;re about to find out.&quot;</p>
