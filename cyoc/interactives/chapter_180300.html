<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, elsewhere Danny was fuming. <br />
<br />
Wow. WOW. WOOOOOOOW. Who did Jackson think he was? Not only did he not even apologize for sleeping with his best friend&#39;s girlfriend behind his back, but he also said that it was Danny&#39;s fault that people at school didn&#39;t like him. Never mind that Jackson and the rest of the jocks could be just as arrogant as he was, but did Jackson forgot about how racist all the jocks were? Not only twoards him but his brother and the rest of the Asians in the school. Did Jackson forget that he called him &quot;Yellow Boy&quot; and said that&#39;s why Sasha cheated on him? Ugh, the memories of all the good times he had with Jackson in the past were the only things stopping him from using the Chronivac and turning him into a bug or something. Perhaps Danny should turn Jackson into an Asian muscle daddy instead of staying white. Maybe he could even turn him into another race in general once he gets home.<br />
<br />
Geez, speaking of home, Danny honestly wanted to go home early. He didn&#39;t want to spend any more time with his former best friend than he had to. Well, that was until another victim of Sasha&#39;s crashed the after-party.<br />
<br />
That victim was Sam, the soccer player, and while Danny didn&#39;t recall all the details of what he looked like before, he could tell that changes did happen to him. Just like Gabe and Terry, Sam was looking distinctly half Asian. His eyes and skin tone had changed the most however his spikey blond hair had only turned dirty blond, and his eyes were still blue. Sam&#39;s body looked about the same, maybe a bit skinnier than he remembered, but soccer players were not known for their bulk anyway. This combination of traits made Sam look like a certain anime character he and Jin liked to make fun of...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... Uh, David, right?&quot; Sam asked as he approached the Asian Adonis.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Danny,&quot; he said, a bit annoyed, but he let it slide since neither of them knew each other well. Danny was also surprised that Sam was here, considering he wasn&#39;t invited to the pool party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, right. Hey, is it true that Jackson shaved his head? I saw a picture that he did on Facebook, but I needed to see for myself,&quot; Sam explained eagerly while pulling up his phone that had a picture of the freshly shaved Jackson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he did.&quot; Danny was taken aback by Sam&#39;s energy. Was he always this energetic, or was this the type of twink Sam was turning into?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sick. I can&#39;t wait until I see that for myself. Where is, by the way. Oh! And why did he do it in the first place? Give me all the deets.&quot; Sam&#39;s response was making Danny think. Were the mental changes happening faster with Sam because there weren&#39;t too many physical changes to make? Was he turning into a twink that loved gossip like some of the girls at his school? Man, he needed to research twinks when he got back home. Uh, for pure research and observational purposes, mind you. <br />
<br />
Wait, gossip, huh? You know Sam was friends with Jackson, wasn&#39;t he? Or at least he was better acquainted with Jackson than he was with Danny. Suddenly Danny had an idea to at least get under Jackson&#39;s skin a bit more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have any &#39;deets,&#39; but I have some other rumors about him, and it involves you too. So, are you interested?&quot; Danny asked. Sam&#39;s nodding in agreement told him that he could continue. &quot;Well, you didn&#39;t hear it from me, but I heard that Jackson thinks you&#39;re looking hot these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam was surprised that that was the rumor Danny was telling him. &quot;R-Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he said that you were looking super sexy, like a model or something. In fact, I heard that he would visit your goal if you know what I mean.&quot; Danny made an obscene gesture to prove his point. Many Danny was having way too much fun manipulating Sam like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh, really? I-I didn&#39;t know he swung that way,&quot; Sam blushed brightly. Even Danny had to admit that Sam was being rather cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he does, but it&#39;s probably not best to talk to about it here, maybe at school tomorrow?&quot; Danny said while trying his best not to smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe... Uh, anyway, thanks for telling me this, Danny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, problem. And don&#39;t forget, you didn&#39;t hear it from me.&quot; Danny replied as Sam left to go find Jackson&#39;s shaved head. Once he knew that Sam was gone, he chuckled. Now Jackson was going to have another twink trying to get into his pants. Until Jackson accepts that he was gay, that was probably going to further annoy him.<br />
<br />
Ah, but now it was probably time for Danny and his brother to head home for the night. While he wanted to know where Terry and Gabe went, he probably could guess what they were doing. Besides, it was a school night, after all, and he couldn&#39;t wait until he saw what changes will happen at school tomorrow.</p>
