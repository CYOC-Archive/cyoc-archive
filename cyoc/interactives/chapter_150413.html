<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna moved closer to Sam and took his hand in hers.  &quot;I guess it&#39;s the change that is making me still feel so horny so maybe I&#39;d take you up on that...except that I&#39;m feeling rather attached to my new boyfriend, sorry.&quot;  Sam squeezed her hand and smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a creep, then.&quot;  said Mark.<br />
<br />
Anna shook her head.  &quot;No, we understand completely.  It&#39;s about time to head towards orientation anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly both Anna and Sam doubled over in pain.  At the sight of his new friends screaming on the floor, Mark opened the door to the hall and started yelling for help.   Soon the hall chaperone arrived, a centaur-man, but the couple had stopped screaming, and lay panting on the ground.  <br />
<br />
Then a panicked look came to Sam&#39;s eyes and he pulled off his shirt.  Two wings leathery wings had sprouted from his back.  They weren&#39;t half as big as Candi&#39;s, yet, but still, he looked over his shoulder at the alien appendages with fright.  &quot;What the hell is it?&quot;  he cried out in a voice that was a couple octaves too high.  &quot;Get them off me, get them off!&quot;  Anna just stared in shock, though bulges could be seen under the back of her shirt as well.   The centaur knelt down and grabbed hold of Sam.  &quot;Please, try to stay calm.  I know it&#39;s strange but this is all part of the process.&quot;   After a while the hysterical boy did calm down, but then he saw Mark staring at him, or rather, his exposed chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...&quot; said Mark as he pointed, and Sam looked down to see not only that he had lost significant muscle mass, but that he had two small breast buds and his nipples were much larger and rosy red.   The centaur handed Sam his shirt back so that he could cover himself.  Sam clutched it to his chest in shame...and at last the dam broke, and he cried.  He cried like, like a girl, and the thought just made him cry more.  Then he felt a hand take his, and he looked over to see Anna.  Her eyes were moist, but she was holding strong.  Her once sizeable breasts had shrunk so that they were barely larger than his new buds, and her angelic facial features now looked sharper, more masculine.  He still thought she was beautiful though.<br />
<br />
The centaur spoke.  &quot;Your changes seem to have been accelerated.  This isn&#39;t unheard of, but it&#39;s incredibly rare and usually requires some sort of trigger.  We should get both of you to the infirmary.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the infirmary, two medical professionals, both of which were snake-people, nagas, looked them over.  The orientation had begun in the main hall and was playing on a T.V. screen.  At last one of the nagas spoke.  &quot;I&#39;m doctor Harriet Hicks.  This is doctor Wilson Milton.  I see from your files that you two are both sex demons?  A succubus and an incubus?  Forgive me for asking a personal question, but did you happen to have sex just before your changes accelerated?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam and Anna nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was probably the trigger, then.  As your new forms will both be sexual in nature, sex will likely only trigger them to emerge faster, particularly if it&#39;s sex with another hypersexual being.  There&#39;s no preventing the inevitable of course, but I&#39;d still caution against having sex anymore until you&#39;re fully transformed, if you can manage to resist.  As you&#39;ve already noticed, rushing the change is highly stressful to the body, and painful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded again.  He&#39;d heard the words, but in truth, he was barely listening.  He was too absorbed in how sexy the doctor looked...the *male* doctor.   Doctor Milton was young, muscular, had chiseled features...  Sam tore his eyes away, and tears threatened to fill his eyes again.  He really was turning into a slut...<br />
<br />
Perhaps guessing what had transpired, Dr. Harriet asked Dr. Wilson to take Anna into another room so that she could have a private chat with Sam.   &quot;Sam, listen to me.  I know this is all crazy, I know it&#39;s hell, but it doesn&#39;t have to be all bad.  Please trust me when I say that it can be wonderful to be a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not just turning into a woman!&quot;  He shouted.  &quot;I&#39;m turning into some sort of super slut monster like Candi White!  How is that wonderful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Sam, there are two things you need to understand.  Number one is that you will always be you.  Many transformees say that going through a radical change like this actually served to be enlightening, because so much changes but the most important things stay the same.  You&#39;ll become a girl, and yes you&#39;ll be attracted to men and have a powerful sex drive, but you&#39;ll also learn about yourself, learn what parts of you can NEVER change.  Change helps us find our true soul, Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam tried to find hope in her words, and maybe later he would, but for the moment he was just numb to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Number two is that you will always have free will.  You don&#39;t HAVE to follow Ms. White&#39;s path.  In fact, your relationship with Anna may help in that regard.  Succubi are new so we don&#39;t know a lot about them, but if they&#39;re anything like certain other hypersexual monster species, it may be possible to focus your drive on one individual.  Devotion to one person may keep your lust for others down to a reasonable level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that was a little encouraging.  He still didn&#39;t want to be a girl, but being Anna&#39;s girlfriend sounded a lot easier to adjust to than being some famous cock sucking slut alongside Candi.  At least this way he could have a semi-normal life.  He wasn&#39;t sure if their budding relationship could survive their gender swaps or not, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think you&#39;re ok to make it to the rest of the orientation?  After we find you some clothes that fit better, of course...&quot;  His current clothes were now quite baggy on him.  &quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot;  He replied.<br />
<br />
Most of the orientation he just watched on the T.V. screen as he got dressed and the doctor finished her psychological evaluation of him and proclaimed him fit enough to go, but he made it to the main hall just in time to, well to fill out paperwork and other boring shit. He finished up with business and meandered about the hall observing other students.  Lunch was in 25 min.  He had an assigned lunch table, supposedly to promote making friends that would help him through the transition.<br />
<br />
 He was dressed in a long robe that came to just below his knee, as were many of the other students.  They were designed to be loose enough to accommodate changing bodies underneath.  His had holes cut in the back for his wings.  He&#39;d have to cut another hole when his spade tail grew in, but the doctor had said that succubus tails were actually quite sharp, a defensive weapon, and so he could cut it with that.<br />
<br />
It was all a lot to adjust to, but none of it compared to the training bra holding in his budding new...assets.  He knew no one could see anything through the loose robe, but still his cheeks flushed at every slight movement of the garment against his sensitive chest.  After one such flush, a boy with extremely hairy legs approached him with a wink.  &quot;Hey there.&quot;  said the boy.  &quot;I&#39;m Jim, and I guess I&#39;m turning into a satyr.  What&#39;s a cutie like you turning into, an angel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam knew he had to be bright red, and not from the horrible pick up line.  It was his worst fear come true, the other boy thought he was a girl!  Sam had admittedly lost a couple of inches downstairs when his wings sprouted, as he&#39;d confirmed to his dismay in the bathroom, but he was definitely still male, thank you very much!  He knew his clothing was baggy and he was short now, but he shouldn&#39;t be THAT cute yet.  He ought to look rather androgynous.  Then he saw the slightly intoxicated look in Jim&#39;s eyes, and he realized:  It was the sex aura!  The same hormones and magic that Candi had used on him when they first met, he was now unconsciously using on Jim.  God, was there some way to turn it off, or was he going to have every boy around trying to get into his pants before he even had anything for them to get into?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m uh...Sam.&quot;  he muttered, thankful for once that his name was gender neutral.  &quot;and I&#39;m turning into a succubus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like Candi White?&quot;  Said James, excited.  &quot;So a naughty girl then, not an angel.  Hot.&quot;  James stepped closer, lust evident in his eyes.  &quot;Is it true you need sex like humans need food?  Well, a gentleman would never let a girl go hungry.  If I can ever help, do let me know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam hated to admit that Jim was actually quite attractive, but his attitude was anything but.  &quot;Not interested, sorry.&quot;  He said and began to turn to leave, but Jim grabbed his shoulder.   &quot;Come on baby, don&#39;t be like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go!&quot; said Sam.  Normally he might have clocked Jim, but he just felt so much weaker now, and James was pretty big.  Even then he might have fought back but...well  maybe he was already more of a girl than he wanted to admit.  He just didn&#39;t have the same fight in him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, slut-&quot;  said Jim, but he was interrupted by a tap on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d better choose your next words carefully, and let him go, or I might have to break that pretty nose of yours.&quot;  It was Mark, thank god, with Anna coming up behind him.<br />
<br />
Jim turned, but only laughed at the two feminine looking beings that had approached him.  &quot;Piss of, pansy boys.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
  Mark looked just about ready to punch but Anna stayed his hand.   &quot;Pansy boys?&quot; She said.  &quot;We&#39;re not the ones trying to fuck a dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim blinked, and looked back and forth between Sam and the other two a few times before realization dawned.  &quot;Gross!&quot;  He said, &quot;Fucking pansies everywhere. &quot;  He stormed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks a lot, guys.&quot;  Said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime, dude,&quot;  said Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should report him.&quot;  said Anna.  &quot;A guy like that is a danger, and not just to you.  He might hurt someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam hated having to be rescued, and would rather go fight Jim and regain some manliness than to just report him, but he realized he was only going to change more.  He had to learn new ways of keeping himself safe besides fighting.  He nodded in agreement, but then mentioned the other problem: &quot;I&#39;m not excusing him, but I think I&#39;m admitting some sort of succubus sex aura, and I worry that it might make other guys act similarly.  I have to find out how to shut it off or something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna and Mark nodded.  &quot;Yeah uh...you are.&quot;  said Mark.  &quot;But while I must admit you seem really sexy, it would hardly compel me to assault you like that guy did.  He was a dickbag, end of subject.  Anna&#39;s doing it too, by the way.  Practically every girl we walked by would blush or sigh as she walked passed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna blushed at Mark&#39;s words, and then she and Sam both blushed as they hit each other with their sex auras.  They both looked rather androgynous for now, and yet still Sam found her even hotter than when they first met.  Anna broke the awkward silence.  &quot;The doctor suggested that taking a male name now might help me in adjusting psychologically.  I guess I&#39;ll give it a try.  So, well, call me Aaron.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam blinked in surprise.  How could she accept it so easily?  &quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for something like that, but I guess Sam is gender-neutral anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
His friends nodded, and then...</p>
