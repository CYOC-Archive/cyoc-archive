<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cloud of peach blossom scent sprayed into the air as Colin took a deep breath. <br />
“God it feels good to smell again!” Colin sighed, “It’s perfect for Marcy’s thank you basket.” <br />
“Yes, of course, for Marcy….” Marinette smiled. <br />
“If you have a moment, I have something for you, darling.” <br />
“Oh, okay….” Colin said as he followed his fashionista lover into her studio. <br />
“I have some of your measurements and… well…” Marinette said as she revealed a pair of sleek black tights… that looked a little… slim. “Vwould you mind trying them on?” <br />
“Oh… alright…” Colin said as he went into the model dressing room. <br />
<br />
“Marinette, are you sure these are mine?” Colin grunted, “They’re kinda…. kinda tight.” <br />
“That is the point.” Marinette smiled. <br />
With a hefty grunt, Colin finally got them on, awkwardly shuffling to her. <br />
“Are you sure those were my measurements?” Colin wheezed. “Marinette?” <br />
The French fashionista grinned with flushed cheeks as her handiwork wrapped itself around her love’s bulge. <br />
“I still have to pay for the stuff to make Marcy’s basket.” Colin wheezed, “Can we get back to this later?” <br />
“Ugh, fine…” Marinette huffed. <br />
Colin walked back behind the curtains and wedged his fingers down the waistband, and started to tug… and nothing was budging… <br />
“Oh come on!” Colin groaned, “Geeeeeet off!!!” <br />
Colin knocked himself to the floor, scrambling to his feet as he saw someone else’s past the curtain. <br />
“Marinette, I can’t get the tights off!” <br />
He jumped as he saw a couple of Marinette’s models standing there. <br />
“Marinette made those?” Simone asked as she stood there playing with a thick strand of elegantly curled black hair “That’s… interesting….” <br />
“Maybe… the three of us could… get them off…” added Gemma as she wiped at the drool running down her freckled cheek. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden he got pushed back in as the models flanked him on both sides. He could only sit there as Simone’s silicone J cups pressed into him, her rich honey skin growing hot as she wedged her hand around his dong and started massaging it. Colin squirmed as she started breathing heavily in his face. Gemma ran her warm ivory hands along his waist for a few seconds before dropping the pretense and stroking his pecs while nibbling his ear. <br />
“No, Marinette’s my girlfriend! Get off of me!” Colin groaned. <br />
“Mrs Allaire doesn’t have to know…” Gemma drooled as she brushed her silky red hair aside. <br />
“Yeah… it’ll be our secret…” Simone whispered as started planting kisses along his neck. <br />
“I said get off!!!” Colin said as he pulled free. <br />
“Colin?” Marinette asked as she looked over to her models strolling towards him, “And vwhy are you two here?” <br />
“We’ll give you our whole paychecks if we get to suck his-“ Simone droned. <br />
“ABSOLUTELY NOT! YOU BOTH NEED TO LEAVE NOW!” Marinette shouted as Colin ran for her supplies. <br />
“Come on, where are the scissors?!” Colin panicked as the models started cornering him. <br />
In a panic he jumped through the open back door and booked it down the street. <br />
<br />
Simone and Gemma suddenly snapped out of their trance and turned around completely confused. <br />
“Mrs. Allaire?” Simone asked the fuming Marinette. <br />
“What’s wrong?” Gemma added. <br />
**********************************************<br />
<br />
Colin nearly fell over as he caught himself on a bike railing. <br />
He paused and asked “Wait a minute… did I leave my-?” <br />
“Colin?” A voice asked from behind. <br />
Luan was standing there completely flustered. <br />
Colin followed the Ginger’s gaze and remembered what he was wearing… was wearing… <br />
IN PUBLIC!!!! <br />
“Ahhhhh!!!” Colin screeched, “Quick Luan, I need some shorts or something!!!” <br />
“Oh, uhhhh, here!” Luan shouted as she tossed him something from the box he was carrying. <br />
Without a second thought, he ran behind some trash cans and slipped it on. <br />
“Here’s a pair of my grampa’s old sneakers!” Luan said as she tossed the shoes to him. <br />
Colin looked over to her confused. <br />
“Oh right, you’ll need socks too!” The ginger giggled as she tossed him some ankle socks, “I was picking up sone stuff for my dad and-“ <br />
“No, no, I get it.” He said as he finished lacing up the shoes. “But you’re saying this was your grampa’s?” <br />
“Yeah, it’s some of his old stuff from the… 70s….” Luan blushed. <br />
<br />
Great. Perfect. Not only was he stuck in these schlong hugging tights, but he’d went and put on a pair of bright red booty shorts over it. <br />
And Luan wasn’t the only one ogling his butt. <br />
“Oh myyyy…” blushed a cyclist “Imma get a piece of that.” <br />
Luan snapped out of it and said, “Leave my boyfriend alone!” <br />
She looked around and realized they were both gone. <br />
“If you’re talking about that sweet piece of ass in the alley, he went that way.” an ashen haired woman said as she unlocked her bike. <br />
Luan dropped everything she was holding and pushed the stranger over before grabbing the bike and furiously pedaling. <br />
“Hey that’s my- oh shit these are five-hundred bucks on eBay! Nevermind!” The older woman called as she rounded up all the old sneakers. <br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
“And that’s how I got here!” Colin said, “Cone on, you really have to help me!” <br />
Silence. <br />
“Lucy? Lucy?” Colin asked.<br />
The short brunette stood there speechless; her pupils were dilated, her cheeks flushed rosy red, not uttering a sound as a damp stain formed in her shorts. <br />
“Lucy?” Colin said as he snapped a couple times. <br />
“The way she talks about you, of course she’s gonna be that way with that fit.” Replied a blonde with a half shaved head.<br />
“Listen, I really need help!” Colin pleaded, “I’m stuck in the tights! They won’t come off!” <br />
“Say no more, brah.” She said as she lead him into the manager’s office. <br />
As much as she strained and pulled, the fabric wouldn’t budge. <br />
“Jesus, what is this shit made of?!” The gym blonde groaned. <br />
“Just use the scissors!” Colin said.<br />
“Relax dude, what’s the hurry?” She asked as the cyclist kicked the door open. <br />
“Oh no you don’t, that ass is mine!” She panted as she ran in. <br />
The blonde held her back effortlessly with a causal “I don’t swing that way.” <br />
“Stop!!!” A third voice yelled. <br />
They turned to a sweaty stacked redhead leaning in the door, panting like a dog as she chugged a bottle of water from the mini fridge  “I’m Luan Langley, and she’s been chasing my-!” <br />
The three looked to see that he was gone. <br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
“And you’re still stuck?” Mina asked. <br />
“Yes, please, I need some scissors!” Colin pouted.<br />
“I’ll cover any shift you need, please!” <br />
“Ugh fine!” Mina groaned with an eye roll. <br />
“Yo Mina, what’s goin’ o-“ Olivia said as she paused for a few moments and started snickering. “Hey Colin… Colin, yo….” <br />
“What?” Colin asked. <br />
“NICE FIT, MAN!” Olivia shouted as she started howling with laughter, “BWAAAAAAHAHAHSHAHA!!!!… Where y’all headin’ with all that cake?! Aaaaaaahahaha!!!!” <br />
“Home to crawl under my bed and die.” Colin grumbled. <br />
“Aye, aye guys, get a load of Colin!” Olivia called as Ronnie finally grabbed the scissors. <br />
“Alright, what’s going-“ Ronnie said as she got a look “Oh my fucking god…” <br />
Ronnie started with a chuckle that turned into howling laughter as loud as Olivia’s. <br />
“What are you idiots laughing about?” Tina said as she looked over and felt the color flooding up her face as she burst out cackling. <br />
“Hey girls, what’s-?” Marcy said as she froze up blushing. <br />
<br />
“Alright that’s enough!” Wendy shouted, “Get back to work!” <br />
Tina’s face turned even redder as she awkwardly shuffled away. <br />
“Okay, okay, we’re done!” Olivia sighed as she wiped the tears away.<br />
“Holy crap, I’m gonna pee!” Ronnie giggled. <br />
Colin hid his face behind his hands as Wendy placed a hand on his shoulder. <br />
“Don’t feel too bad, Wendy likes it.” Mins smirked.<br />
The pink haired woman folded her arms over her nipples  poking up under her shirt and shouted “HELP HIM OR YOU’RE FIRED!” <br />
“Alright, alright, here’s the scissors.” Mina sighed. <br />
Colin walked to the bathroom, scissors in hand as he closed the door behind him. <br />
<br />
“Sorry Marinette…” Colin said as he made two careful snips around the  waist of the tights and finally pulled the whole mess down. <br />
With a couple extra snips, he was free of the tights.<br />
“Sweet freedom.” Colin smiled as he pulled his briefs up his legs. <br />
“No.” a skinny blonde said as she grabbed his wrists, “Not yet.” <br />
“What the fuck?!” Colin shouted as he slammed the door closed and locked it. He finished putting the shorts and sneakers back on as he pushed his way out the door. <br />
<br />
“Hey, can you come to my place tonight?” Marcy started. <br />
“I need to go home…” Colin said quietly. <br />
“Yeah, he gotta go cool off them buns!!!!!” Olivia shouted as she started cackling again. <br />
Colin stepped out of the store.. no phone or wallet… <br />
“At least it can’t get any worse….” Colin grumbled right as the cyclist pulled up with gleaming lustful eyes “I just had to say that.” <br />
“Don’t worry, I’m coming!” Luan panted as she wheeled up on a bike that the blonde stranger immediately knocked her off of. <br />
“I’ll help you if I get first taste.” The blonde said.<br />
“I hate my life.” said Colin. <br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
“And so, here I am, curled up next to your car.” Colin said. “Soooo…. HIDE ME!” <br />
“Of course, we didn’t need to hear about your whole day!” Shara said as she unlocked the doors. <br />
Colin slipped in the back seat and sighed as Shara turned the key. <br />
And there was nothing but sputtering.<br />
“Seriously?!” Colin panicked. <br />
“Relax, I have Onstar…” Shara sighed as Colin sat there “quietly” hyperventilating. <br />
All of the sudden, the cyclist slammed into the window topless, grinding her breasts against the car hungrily. <br />
“What the hell?! Get off my car!” Shara shouted as she leaned out the window. <br />
Colin rolled out the other door screaming as he ran into another car. <br />
“Help, stalker!” Colin shouted as he banged on the door. <br />
Gemma glared and drove away from the guy who made her lose her job as he pleaded for a rescue. <br />
<br />
“Heeeeeeeelp!!!!!” Colin screamed as he ran through the parking lot. <br />
Without another thought, he frantically ran into an open door and slammed it behind him. <br />
“Hi Colin!” Jamie casually waved from the other passenger seat. <br />
“Whoa, hey babe, what’s going on?” Jessie asked. <br />
“We need to get out of here!” Colin panicked as the creepy bargain co blonde stood there clutching a knife. <br />
“Say no more!” Jessie said as she reversed away and floored it. <br />
The stalkers hopped back on their bikes riding inhumanly fast towards him. <br />
“SPEED UP!!!!” Colin screamed. <br />
“It’s not made for speed, man!” Jessie shouted. <br />
“We were just gonna go camping for a couple days!!!” <br />
‘Camping…’ Colin thought as he pulled a black can out of a shopping bag. <br />
<br />
The crazed pair approached the side window as it rolled down; Colin wasted no time whipping out the bear spray and absolutely blasting them. <br />
They screamed in pain as their bikes got tangled and tumbled over. <br />
“Who were they? And where’d the totes yummy shorts come from?” Jamie asked. <br />
“It’s a long story….” Colin sighed. <br />
<br />
The trio could heard a Semi’s horn blaring as it rolled down with a thunderous CRUNCH. <br />
“Keep driving.” Colin said bluntly.</p>
