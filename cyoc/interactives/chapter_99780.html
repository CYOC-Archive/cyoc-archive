<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dice stopped rolling, right ont he edge of the benchtop, with the number four facing upward. Jennifer found herself free to move around and immediately stormed upstairs to her bedroom.<br />
&quot;Fucking little perverted freak!&quot; she spat. &quot;Dan will teach him a lesson.&quot;<br />
Dan was captain of the football team, and practically twice the size of Kyle. The corners of her mouth twisted ever so slightly into an evil grin as she imagined Dan towering over Kyle, ready to pound him into hospital. Dan would do anything for Jennifer, and she knew it.<br />
After entering her bedroom, Jennifer saw the bra, cheerleading skirt, and single sock she had been wearing were laid out on her bed. She noticed the other sock slightly poking out from under the foot of her bed and picked it up. She sat on her bed and slipped both socks on her feet. Next, she picked up her bra and stuck her arms through. She pulled it down over her breasts and reached behind her to hook it up. She stood up to put her cheerleading skirt back on, but something didn&#39;t feel right. She turned to look at herself in the mirror on her wardrobe. She looked at herself in shock. The bra fit perfectly snug everywhere, only the cups had bunched and folded upward instead of covering her breasts. The bra looked ridiculous. She grabbed frantically at the folds and tried desperately to pull them down over her breasts, with no success. She gave up and ripped the bra off, tearing one of the straps that looped over her shoulder.<br />
She snatched up her cheerleading skirt and quickly stepped into it. She pulled it up as far as it would go, but a force of some kind would not let her pull it over her pussy or her ass. She gave up and threw it on the floor with her bra. She tried on several pairs of underwear, including one of her thongs, and even her bikini as she grew more and more desperate to cover herself before she had to leave for the bus.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; She said, startling herself. &quot;I am not leaving this house if i cannot put any clothes on.&quot;<br />
Though even as she spoke the words she knew, somehow, that she would leave the house, get on the bus, and go to school as normal.<br />
&quot;As normal...&quot; she repeated the thought that was not her own. The wheels had finally begun to turn in the young cheerleaders head. She raced downstairs and snatched up the note that had come in the box. Slowly and carefully, she read it over again.<br />
There it was.<br />
&quot;... for the duration of that day. You will attend school and any other activities as normal...&quot; She read it aloud. &quot;This is going to ruin my life.&quot;<br />
She tried opening the box marked with a 5. but her fingers could not work the tape off the box. She remembered that she had rolled a four, and picked up the box marked with a 4. She barely touched the top of it and it opened practicaly on its own.<br />
She looked inside, somewhat surprised to find only a single leaf. She removed the leaf and looked at it.<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this going to do?&quot; She demanded.<br />
She turned back to the note, and re-read tha part about the leaves covering her vagina and nipples. She looked in the box again and shook it violently.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s only one fucking leaf.&quot; She said, annoyed.<br />
She read further through the note to the part about one leaf covering only her vagina. Her mouth opened in shock.<br />
&quot;What about my boobs?&quot; She asked, panic creeping into her now. &quot;I can&#39;t wear a fucking leaf to school...&quot;<br />
She brought the fresh, bright green leaf down to her vagina and pressed it onto her skin. Amazingly, after letting go of it, the leaf stayed exactly where it was.<br />
Suddenly, a more powerful urge began to take over. She had to grab her stuff for school. The bus would be here very soon.<br />
She found her body quickly gathering her bag homework that was scattered throughout teh house. Jennifer hated hmework and so when forced to sit still for too long, became bored quite easily. She preffered to be out doing something, being physically active. Hence her initial attraction to cheerleading. While doing homework, her boredom caused her to move from room to room every ten or fifteen minutes to be somewhere &quot;new&quot;.<br />
Jennifer slung her bag over her shoulders as she heard the bus approaching. She found that she wasn&#39;t being forced to move exactly. It was like her body wanted to go, but her mind was against it. Unfortunately for her, at this point in time, the mind did not control the body.<br />
She opened her front door just as the bus stopped at the curb and walked outside. She felt her nipples harden at being exposed to the fresh, cold air. And really harden at that. Taking her first few steps toward the bus, she instinctively brought her hands up and cupped them over her breasts. A few seconds later, she found herself stepping up into the bus. The bus driver looked at her with a raised eyebrow, then shrugged and turned back to face the road.<br />
She walked down the aisle to the back of the bus, where her friend Susan always saved a seat for her.<br />
As she approached the seat, Susan looked at her quizzically. &quot;What are you doing with your hands?&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious?&quot; Jen snapped. &quot;I&#39;m covering my boobs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aaw, poor Jen.&quot; Susan said.<br />
This time Jen looked at Susan with a raised eyebrow. &quot;Poor Jen what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Look down, sweetie.&quot;<br />
Jennifer slowly looked down, and her jaw dropped when she saw her hands. While they had felt like they were covering her boobs, now that her attention was on them, she was fully aware that her hands were cupping the top of her stomach, just below her tits. Jennifer would have screamed if Susan hadn&#39;t giggled right then.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s funny about this?&quot; Jennifer demanded, shaking er friend in an attempt to make her aware of what was going on.<br />
&quot;Jen, what&#39;s up with you today?&quot; Susan asked, removing Jennifer&#39;s hands from her shoulders. &quot;You know you mostly can&#39;t cover your bodies fun-parts. Only with the box&#39;s gifts. I thought you were joking honey.&quot;<br />
&quot;Joking?&quot; Jen was whispering at a yell. &quot;Susan, look at me. The entire bus saw my tits when i walked down the aisle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jen, they&#39;ve seen a lot more than that before.&quot;<br />
&quot;What, no they haven&#39;t!&quot; Jen protested. &quot;That little shit, Kyle Perkins cursed me this morning. Now the whole school is going to see my boobs and bum. Susan you have to help me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jen, you&#39;ve always been like this, now get up, we have to get to class.&quot;<br />
Jennifer hadn&#39;t even noticed that they had reached the school already. She stood up, not wanting to, and exited the bus. She walked towards the school, redKyle -faced in a level of embarrassment she had never come close to experiencing before.<br />
Her arms swung by her sides, useless in shielding anyone from looking at her, as she followed Susan into the school, then to thier first class as the bell rang.<br />
Jennifer was only a few metres from the doorway to her first class when suddenly she heard hysteric laughter.<br />
She spun angrily around and scanned the crown around her for the source. It was Kyle. Jennifer stormed over to him and grabbed him by the shirt.<br />
&quot;Kyle, you little shit. Undo this, now!&quot; Jennifer demanded.<br />
Kyle smirked evilly. &quot;Couldn&#39;t even if i wanted to, Jenny.&quot; He said smugly. &quot;In case you&#39;ve forgotten, I cursed you, which means you now have the curses power.&quot;<br />
Kyle could see the wheels turning in the cheerleader&#39;s head as she once again finally realised what had happened.<br />
&quot;Alright, Kyle.&quot; Jennifer said. &quot;If you won&#39;t help me, I will help myself, through you. Transform or...&quot;</p>
