<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you complete the process of installing the toilet and exit the bathroom, you notice something is amiss. <br />
<br />
Where was the empty box and packing materials that you&#39;d left in the hallway? Had the workman stopped in during his break and cleaned them up? Didn&#39;t seem likely. The workman strictly adhered to his breaks, which you couldn&#39;t fault him at. <br />
<br />
You quickly went to the lounge. The TV showed some informercial, which you&#39;re sure that Jonas hadn&#39;t approved of. You checked other rooms, not finding your toilet friend, before going to the front door, exiting the house. You wanted to check on the off chance that the workman had packed up Jonas and put him into his truck. <br />
<br />
You saw the workman in his truck, enjoy lunch and checking his phone. <br />
<br />
You almost hated to interrupt him. <br />
<br />
He noticed you and your confused expression. He swallowed his bite of food and lowered the window. &quot;Hey there, need something?&quot; he asked, with a polite tone, though slightly strained, most likely from having his break interrupted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to bother you, but, ur, do you know where the other toilet went?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The new toilet? Coworker called. Needed a fixture for a job. Since you didn&#39;t need it, he swung by to pick it up.&quot; <br />
<br />
You attempted to control yourself from giving a look of horror. You manage to control your panic and respond with a semi-level, &quot;Y-Yeah?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. You know that nature park up north a ways, next to that lake?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, like, ur, a few hours up the highway?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the one. We&#39;re the closest town so they hired us. Really beautiful out there. Nice place to get away for the weekend. Need anything else...?&quot; the workman gives a longing glance at his sandwich. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. T-Thank you. Ur, maybe could you tell me where exactly? Wanna see if it is nearby where my family used to camp?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where he&#39;s installing the toilet?&quot; the workman gives you an odd look. <br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know how to respond, so you just give a small nod. <br />
<br />
The look passes and the workman shrugs. &quot;Sure thing. Will ask him and text it your way after I&#39;m done with lunch.&quot; With that he rolls back up the window and continues his break. <br />
<br />
You go inside, checking directions to the nature park, and heading down to the basement to check the device for further information. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jonas feels the truck going over roads of various states, nervous that he&#39;s going to be cracked on sizable bumps. He loses sense of time, but swears that its been hours by the time they finally stop, with crunching characteristic of a gravel driveway. <br />
<br />
The sun is low in the sky when the box and packing materials are removed from Jonas. He&#39;s able to see that they&#39;re next to a gravial parking lot. There&#39;s a forest of pine trees on one side of the lot. On the other side, down a slope, there&#39;s a lake. <br />
<br />
This is all Jonas is able to see before the workman hoists him up and he&#39;s carried into a cinderblock constructed men&#39;s bathroom, the door stuck open with a wooden wedge. <br />
<br />
The interior is very bare bones, cinderblock walls, an industrial steel sink, and a stained toilet that had seen better days. &quot;Oh no,&quot; Jonas thought, &quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; Jonas was set onto the cement floor, next to a drain set in the middle of the room. There was no stall. Just the open room for one user at a time. <br />
<br />
The workman busied himself unscrewing and removing the old toilet from its place while Jonas had an existential crisis, hoping that his friend would burst in at any moment to rescue him. <br />
<br />
This didn&#39;t happen, and soon enough, Jonas found himself lowered over the pipe in the floor and a fixed to intake pipes, water soon flowing into his tank, and after a push of his lever, filling his bowl with fresh cool water. <br />
<br />
He attempted to sputter and speak up, any fear of embarrassment he&#39;d have at his form circumvented by the fear of being left as a toilet in his janky nature stop bathroom. <br />
<br />
However, Jonas&#39; attempt failed. The toilet remained still and immobile and silent, as most toilets tend to be. <br />
<br />
The workman gave the toilet another flush, cool water rushing through Jonas&#39; pipes and internal workings, causing him to feel refreshed-yet-disoriented. The workman gives a nod. &quot;That should do it.&quot; He picks up the old toilet and leaves the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Jonas can&#39;t believe this. The workman couldn&#39;t seriously just leave him like this, right? <br />
<br />
As if in response, the workman returns. Jonas hopes that maybe the workman received a call and that there&#39;d been some serious mistake and there was a chance of rescue. <br />
<br />
Instead, the workman removed the wedge, closed the door, and locked it. He walked over to Jonas, lifted the toilet&#39;s lid and seat, unzipped the front of his coveralls and lowered his boxers. He aimed at the toilet bowl, and gave a sigh of relief as he emptied his bladder. <br />
<br />
Jonas had many concerns of this happening. Again. But had no way to voice them. <br />
<br />
The workman finished, shook himself a few times, before pulling his boxers back up and zipping his coveralls back up. With a final flush of the toilet, he left. <br />
<br />
Jonas noticed that the door didn&#39;t properly close when unlocked, stuck open a few inches. Again, not that he could do anything about it. Anyways, he was still distracted by the lingering horror of being used as a toilet. Again! He decided this would be the last time he&#39;d agree to any dubious test runs of reality shifting devices, even for the chance to be a dragon. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; you say, taking another look at the nature park information. Turned out the front gate was closed at 9 PM and didn&#39;t reopen until 7 AM. And after all the research and checks, you didn&#39;t want to take a two and a half hour drive in the dark to break into the nature park. <br />
<br />
Didn&#39;t help that the device couldn&#39;t seemed to put exact coordinates on Jonas. You figured that purpose him being transferred so far away he might be out of range. But even if you could properly track him with the device, it wouldn&#39;t work at a range. That required a few more weeks of work and field extenders. And even then, you weren&#39;t quite sure if field extenders could reach that far. <br />
<br />
You&#39;d have to do some more investment on whether satellite targeting could work without causing an incident. You didn&#39;t want to start accidently turning people into toilets via satellite. <br />
<br />
At least you had information from the workman&#39;s coworker on where the toilet had been located, though the directions were a bit vague and might be tricky to follow. At the least should narrow down where Jonas ended up. <br />
<br />
You figure you&#39;ll start out fresh tomorrow morning in search for your toilet friend. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Darkness falls over the nature park bathroom area. A shadowy figure comes out of the woods and approaches. <br />
<br />
There&#39;s a creak as the door opens. Jonas steels himself for an awkward experience with a nature lover when realizes the visitor isn&#39;t human at all. <br />
<br />
A coyote slips through the cracked open door and trots onto the cement floor of the the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Jonas at first is scared at being confronted by a wild animal in close quarter, but eventually calms as the coyote sniffs around realizing that he&#39;s a mere toilet. He has no skin or flesh to be bitten, just porcelain. <br />
<br />
Still, having the scruffy candid walk in his direction is rather strange and disorienting. He&#39;s not quite sure what the coyote is doing until it sticks its face down into his bowl and laps at the water. As the coyote drinks at the cool water in the bowl, Jonas gives a mental sigh of relief. Even considering he was a toilet, this was a rather cool experience. He&#39;d never been this close to a wild animal before. <br />
<br />
Eventually the coyote finishes drinking and Jonas figures the creature will be leaving. <br />
<br />
Instead, the coyote walks around the room in a circle, sniffing at corners, before eventually coming back to Jonas, sniffing at his base. The coyote then scoots up next to Jonas and raises its leg. <br />
<br />
Jonas is rather confused what&#39;s happening until he feels warm liquid on his porcelain. Liquid coming from the coyote. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! What the hell?! Are you seriously peeing on me?&quot; Jonas thinks angrily at the coyote, who just completes marking his territory on the toilet before lowering its leg. <br />
<br />
The coyote does a final investigation of the bathroom, before slipping out the door, back into the night.</p>
