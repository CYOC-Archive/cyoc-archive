<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kyle, who had completely forgotten he was ever Kyle, stood in the bathroom attempting to sort out a way to deal with the current predicament, the amulet on the floor began to glow.<br />
<br />
Deep in Sector 5, six other objects began to glow. As each one glowed brighter and brighter...responding toward the magic of the amulet each in a different manour...Kyle was suddenly overcome with another sense of vertigo and for a split second he almost blacked out again.<br />
<br />
As this was happening, Alissa stirred from were she was lying and sitting up, she called out, &quot;Kyle? Kyle, where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sliding off the table, figuring it was time to explain to Kyle what had happened and to see if he wanted to involve their superior, Alissa began to slowly dress, bothered that she couldn't find the amulet or her skirt.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;What the hell,&quot; she exited the conferance room..without anything on to cover her underwear...and began to look about. As she did, Alissa heard a clicking noise and turning toward the sound, she saw that the bathroom had opened a crack. Hurrying over, she pushed it open.<br />
<br />
As she did, she exclaimed, &quot;Kyle. If this is one of your jokes, so help me....&quot; But stopped in midsentence as she found herself looking in at an empty bathroom.<br />
<br />
Looking down, she saw her skirt and next to it, partially hidden, the amulet. Picking both up, she put the rest of her clothes back on, hung the amulet around her neck, decided against that course of action and exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Stopping at her desk, she booted up the computer and set the amulet next to the monitor. Next she went back to the conferance room and collected Kyle's clothes. Folding them up, she returned to her desk and setting in a filing drawer, she began to first file and then search for any information on the amulet.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Kyle, meanwhile, was still standing in what she thought of as the coed bathroom at Sector 5. After a minutes thought, and the complete passing of the sensation of vertigo, she decided that maybe she should get Alissa for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;That or maybe my mommy,&quot; Kyle thought, unsure of why she suddenly thought this.<br />
<br />
Opening the door was a minour inconvenience due to the sudden decrease in height, but in the end she managed. Stepping out of the bathroom, Kyle suddenly experienced another sense of vertigo, but this was passed even quicker and she began to look about.<br />
<br />
Beneath her feet she felt a plush carpet and looking down she confirmed that she was indeed standing on what she thought she was standing on. Looking left and right, she took measure of the hallway she suddenly found herself standing in and then realised she had no sense of measurment at all.<br />
<br />
Confused, Klye choose a direction and began to walk in the direction she thought was right. After a few seconds she came to a bedroom and stepping in she looked about.<br />
<br />
A bright pink and white room greeted her, with an unmade bed covered in Disney Princess sheets and comforter pushed up against one wall. Next to it was a dresser, white with pink knobs and five drawers. Opening one, Kyle took out a nightgown with out really giving it much thought and then stared at as if she had never seen it before in her life.<br />
<br />
It was white, with a picture of Hello Kitty on the front. The cuffs and hem of the article was frilly and pink...the neckline was the same colour as the cuffs and hem.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;What the heck is going on, what the heck am I doing and where is my mommy,&quot; Kyle stood staring at the nightware.<br />
<br />
After a bit more of this, Kyle put it on and then looking about, taking in the plastic tea-set, the white toy box and the closet door, she walked back across the room and out into the hallway again.<br />
<br />
As if following somthing, she returned to the bathroom and without looking around, she opened the cabinet beneath the sink and pulled from within a dry-night. Looking at it, she left the bathroom and headed back to what she was starting to think of as her bedroom. Inside, she looked around again. As she did so, she slid the dry-night on over her privates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I suddenly so tired,&quot; Kyle asked herself as she walked toward the bed, but the question was driven out of her head the moment she saw the Angelina Mousling plush.<br />
<br />
Hugging it in a motherly fashion, Kyle whispered to it, &quot;Adorable mouse,&quot; almost startling himself when he heard the youthful feminine voice issue forth. But instead she yawned and crawled into the bed and snuggling close to the plush rodent, she pulled covers up and started to drift off.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
As Kyle was drifting off, the amulet on Alissa's desk began to glow. Started, unaware that six other objects were responding, Alissa picked up the amulet and whispered, &quot;What the hell,&quot; just as her supervisor Justin walked in.<br />
<br />
Looking at Alissa he barked out, he being exmilitary, &quot;What the hell is going on here and where is Kyle? You know that we got a breach and several objects are acting up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alissa just looked over at him and that after a moment she began to explain.</p>
