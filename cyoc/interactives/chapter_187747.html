<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Chesterton was about to close up for the night when he heard the scuffling feet of the two teens rushing back to his store. They came in quickly and slammed the door. He looked at the two with annoyance. “Back so soon?” he said.<br />
<br />
The two teens looked at each other and held hands tightly. “Yes, we have given it a lot of thought and looked at all of our options and we agree to becoming senior citizens if it means we can be together. But we want to ask a few things first.”<br />
<br />
“Continue.” He said quietly.<br />
<br />
“We want to make sure that you don’t make us too old to enjoy life, or too close to death. And we want to make sure everyone thinks we have been married for say at least 40 years and that we have a nice retirement pension to live off of.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I see you have both given this a lot of thought. I’m impressed. Most of my customers simply agree quickly and often their wishes go awry. OK. How old are you both now?”<br />
<br />
“I’m 16 and Daniella is 14.”<br />
<br />
“Very well. I will age you both 50 years, making you a 66 year old man and Daniella a 64 year old woman. I can guarantee that you will both live at least another 30 years. You will both have a nice pension and you will have both been married 48 years. Sounds reasonable?”<br />
<br />
The two teens looked at each other in silence for a moment, then Tom looked into her eyes and spoke.<br />
<br />
“Are you absolutely sure about this? I mean, you will be giving up your youth. We will be missing the rest of our teens and early adulthood and even our 30s and 40s, a rich part of your life.”<br />
<br />
Daniella squeezed his hand. “I’m sure Tom. You heard my parents, they are going to ship me off to a boarding school on the other side of the country, back in Mexico. I will never see you again. And your folks don’t approve of me either.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, my step-father is a real racist son-of-a-bitch. Ok, let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
The two teens turned back towards Mr. Chesterton.<br />
<br />
“We’re sure. Let’s do it!”<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, Chesterton walked to his desk and picked up a knife. He had places to go and people to see, so this needed to be quickly. Chesterton asked the two teenagers to hold out their palms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blood for blood&quot; he added. Daniella and Tom each held out their hands nervously. With two quick strikes, Chesterton slashed each of their palms. The teens recoiled and screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck man&quot; Tom shouted.<br />
<br />
His pleas were ignored. Chesterton pulled a blank scroll from his pocket and using the blood dripping from the knife, quickly drew a pentagram on the scroll. He picked up a lighter from his desk and lit the scroll on fire. The ashes rested gently in his outstretched hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Place your hands together,&quot; he beckoned. &quot;This is a communion for life and all that comes after. Do you want this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniella looked at Tom nervously. Taming her nerves for a second, Daniella held out her hands. &quot;Yes, I want this.&quot; Tom followed likewise. &quot;I want this.&quot; The two teens gripped each other&#39;s hands tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Daniella&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Tom&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Chesteron walked over to them. He started chanting in Latin, which the two teens could not understand as his eyes turned dark red. He then blew the ashes in his hands towards the teens.<br />
<br />
The ashes whirled in the air and came together on the ground encircling the teens. Suddenly, the ashes sparked, lighting a ring of fire around Daniella and Tom. The fires shot ten feet in the air, creating a wall of flame, and their clothes vanished.<br />
<br />
Daniella and Tom started screaming, unable to let each other go or move. Sweat started pouring profusely down their bodies as they suddenly began to grow and age.<br />
Tom began to get muscle mass as his 16 year old body was rapidly maturing. Soon he was a very well-endowed and muscular 21 year old young man with a rather large and erect penis. Perhaps it was because he was watching Daniella as she was aging quickly too. <br />
<br />
Her 14 year old teen body suddenly matured with her waist thinning and her ass rounding out nicely into a bubble butt as her legs grew much longer and shapelier. Thick black pubic hair grew between her maturing thighs where they had only been a few wisps of hair before. Her small 34 B-0Cup breasts which were just blossoming suddenly began growing and filling out like two water balloons as she soon had a pair of 36 C-Cup breasts with large areolas and erect nipples. Soon she was in her late teens and heading into her 20s.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Tom had aged into his 30s as hair thickened on his broad chest and as he raced through those years he began to get a little grey in his temples as a short beard grew on his face. Soon he was in his forties with no sense of slowing down.<br />
Daniella soon raced through her twenties as she was now a stunningly beautiful fully grown adult woman, worthy of a Playboy Playmate. Her long silky black hair framed her adult face which had now lost all remaining baby fat and had sharpened and as she entered her thirties her breasts grew into 36 DD-Cups.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Tom was now entering his 50s as his hair and beard started to go grey and his once taught stomach developed a paunch with some love handles on his waist too. Lines were deepening around his eyes giving him a wizened look about him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Daniella was not far behind and as she raced into and through her forties he large gravity defying breasts began to soften a droop some with age and crow’s feet could be seen forming around her eyes as the laugh lines around her mouth began to deepen. The first grey hairs could be seen weaving through her think black mane of hair. Her flay stomach started to form a bit of a muffin top too.<br />
                                                                                                                    <br />
As Tom entered his sixties, he looked like a very distinguished older gentleman, old enough to be his own mother’s father. As the aging stopped at 66 years of age he was still mesmerized by Daniella who he had never taken his eyes off of as his still large and very erect penis showed.<br />
<br />
Daniella had entered her fifties and she could feel hot and cold flashes shoot through her matronly body as she quickly entered and passed out of menopause. By her late fifties her hair was now 2/3rds grey and 1/3 black giving her a slat-and-pepper look. Soon she was 64 years of age and stopped gaining. Her large 38-DD Cup breasts sagged on her frame, but they still held some shape and were still attractive for a woman her age as he ass was also dropping some, but her overall body was still shapely bad attractive for a matronly woman her age, a testament to her good genes. She was now old enough to her own mother’s grandmother as her mother was only 28 year of age.<br />
<br />
Daniella turned and saw her reflection in a mirror on the wall as she put her weathered hand up to her wrinkled face. “I look so old now, OH! My Voice!” she said in a tone that was a good two octaves lower than her former teen voice. She then turned to Tom and said hesitantly. <br />
<br />
“Do you still want me, Tom? I mean now that I look like this?” she said with a tear running down her check. Tom walked slowly over to her and wiped away the tear and looked into her eyes. <br />
<br />
“I think you are still the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.” He said in a booming lower voice as he then leaned in and gave her a long passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
“Ok, ok, that’s enough. Now go in that room and put some clothes on. You will find everything you need in there.”<br />
<br />
The two retiree’s helped each other walk into the next room as they were still not used to the feel of their new bodies. Daniella especially as she felt the two very large orbs on her chest pulling her forward and they swayed back and forth with her every movement. Tom dressed quickly in a conservative outfit as Daniella found a large underwire support bra for her large tits and a pair of sensible panties to put on, then a nice flowing summer dress that went to her ankles and a pair of sensible flats for her arthritic feet.<br />
<br />
They then walked back out as Mr. Chesterton examined them closely. “Perfect!” he said as he threw them both wallets that had their new ID’s, social security cards, credit cards and the like. “You will start to feel some of the mental adjustments over the next few hours.<br />
“Are you ready to leave dear?” she said lovingly.<br />
<br />
“I’m ready if you are old woman. Besides, I want to get to our new home and I think it is time we both lose our virginity, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
The old woman giggled like the former teen she had once been, but it now sounded more like a grandmother laughing. “But of course, dear. I don’t want to be the oldest virgin in town! Now help this old woman to the car, my bones are aching a bit. I’m not as spy as I used to be!” she cackled.<br />
<br />
And with that the elderly couple shuffled out the door to start their new life as an old married couple ready to share their new lives together, even in old age.</p>
