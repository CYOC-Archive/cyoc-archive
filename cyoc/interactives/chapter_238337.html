<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle walked to the bus stop, the alien feelings from his voluptuous body a constant reminder of the curse, every movement caused him to jiggle, he kept glancing down, he&#39;d only dreamed of seeing breasts this big, let alone wearing them. The heels he was wearing forced his body to present itself, even when bending slightly, they pushed out his plush rump, and made him present his breasts proudly. All of this made Kyle very uncomfortable, the breeze kissing his exposed cleavage, and kissing his pantyhose clad legs made all of this even more apparent.<br />
<br />
He stopped, standing at the bus stop, bouncing a little as he stood, a usual thing he did when waiting for the bus, he tried to stop his habit, but started back up again. He shivered, feeling very exposed he was grateful when the bus came up. He got on the bus and sat down in his usual seat, it was a surreal sight, this middle aged bombshell sitting in a school bus, and no one batted an eye. Every bump reminded him of his body, he stared out the window trying to ignore it, and failing with every jiggle. Halfway through the ride his friend Jarred got on the bus and sat next to him.<br />
<br />
“Hey dude, sup?” Jarred said.<br />
<br />
“Nothing, just... not feeling good.”<br />
<br />
“Well you look good at least.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Kyle said confused.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I like the look, shows off your curves.” Jarred said blushing. “I know you said you weren&#39;t interested but...”<br />
<br />
“Not right now dude, um... but... maybe later?” Kyle said, jarred looked surprised, “I need some time to think about that, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Jarred sighed, not in defeat but what seemed relief. “I can wait.” <br />
<br />
With this it dawned on Kyle what Jarred was saying, in this new reality they were still friends, probably from childhood like they were before, and even though he was still considered a guy, everyone around him saw him for the milf he was now, they just acted like he always was a milf. It was a surreal thought, and made things even stranger for the day. Kyle got off the bus, now super aware of the glances he got from men around him, some lingering on his form as he walked by. <br />
<br />
In class his new bust got in the way, his breasts practically resting on the desk, he had to adjust himself repeatedly so that he could write. His bra needed adjusting, not because it was uncomfortable, but because of the way his body wanted to show off his bust, keeping it tight and presented. His every movement of his arms made them apparent, he was becoming more used to his body halfway through the day, but they were just... in the damn way all the time. <br />
<br />
“How did Mrs. Smith deal with these all the time?” He thought, “Well... she was born a girl, and grew them so I guess she had the advantage there.” <br />
<br />
At lunch, he had finally accepted his body, though it was still a little uncomfortable he was getting used to it, and he even flirted a little with Jarred. He hadn&#39;t intended to but something in him was now finding his dorky friend attractive, he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it. Maybe his new bodies hormones were having an affect on him. It was at the end of the day that he ran into Jen, who walked over to him with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Well Jen... I hope your happy with the results of the curse.”<br />
<br />
“What curse?” Jen said, a look of confusion on her face.<br />
<br />
“The one you gave me this morning, to swap bodies with your mom.” Kyle said.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know what your talking about, you always looked like that.” Jen&#39;s eyes went wide, a look of surprise on her face. “I don&#39;t even know why I came over here you fucking dork.” Jen stared at him.<br />
<br />
“Huh, well I guess that dare won&#39;t let you talk to me about it either, now you can&#39;t gloat.” Kyle chuckled, “Now I&#39;ve got things to day, it being Friday and all.” Jen looked made and was about to say something when Kyle held a finger to her lips. “Hold onto that curse for a while, you may want to use it somewhere else, hit me with it later &#39;Kay?” Kyle leaned in and kissed her on the cheek, knowing that would get her upset and started walking away, shaking his ass a little more on purpose. <br />
<br />
“There is no curse you dweeb.” Jen said against her will looking mad. “Fuck.... I can&#39;t even give him shit about his.” She muttered, “I&#39;ll think about how to screw him up later.”<br />
<br />
Kyle met with is friends at the park after school, their usual hangout spot, still self aware he noticed several his friends looking at his breasts. When he caught them he would wink, just to mess with them, but he wanted to lay it on thick with Jarred, he wasn&#39;t sure why he was doing it, but he started getting into the idea of having him for a lover. As they parted and he left the park he froze, across the street walking a dog was his old body, they locked eyes for a minute, a look of shock on both of their faces. They both looked away, unable to keep looking, the kept glancing back at each other, while the curse forced them to not talk to each other, Kyle got an idea, he opened his bag and pulled out a paper, writing a note on it, folded it and put it in a bush. <br />
<br />
He then gathered the courage to try and speak, and it worked. <br />
<br />
“OH GOLLY! A NOTE FOR A FRIEND SOMEWHERE! IN THIS BUSH! I HOPE THAT NO ONE ELSE TAKES IT! THE NOTE! IN THIS BUSH!” He shouted, then fumbled with his bag and rushed away with a crushing sense of anxiety that was caused by the curse, he hoped that she was still standing there, he quickly glanced back and saw her crossing the street in a rush. <br />
<br />
“Good, maybe this will work.” Kyle thought.</p>
