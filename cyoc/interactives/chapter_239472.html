<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve was pondering the app as he drove back to his house.  He’d lived near the mall as a kid but, as an adult, Steve now lived in a modest apartment on the outskirts of town.  Not only did that mean that it was a bit of drive, but it also meant driving through a seemingly endless stretch of dense forest.<br />
<br />
Should he delete the app?  From his brief stint as a laboring rabbit, the inherent danger of the app was more than evident.  On the other hand, Steve was a furry and one of his biggest dreams was to spend at least some time as an anthropomorphic animal, albeit a male and not pregnant one.  The app was his gateway to living out that dream – if he could figure out how to safely use it.  <br />
<br />
Steve was pondering how exactly he should conduct his next test when an opportunity forced itself on him.  He was driving through a stretch of empty road in the middle of the forest when he blew through a stop sign and heard the telltale sound of police sirens behind him.<br />
<br />
Shit!  As he eyed the police car behind him, Steve thought back to how his driver’s license had his old picture on it.  There was no way he would pass as his old self, and the last thing he needed right now was to end up in jail.  Changing back to old Steve so that he could get out of that was insanely risky, but if he could make the cop disappear instead…<br />
<br />
Steve pulled over to the side of the road and looked around.  The only two people here were him and the cop that had pulled up behind him, which meant that this was the perfect opportunity to do another test.  Opening up the app, Steve selected the cop and generated a sentence:<br />
<br />
“The police officer is walking up to Steve’s car.”<br />
<br />
Perfect, it was short and easy to manipulate.  All Steve had to do was change the words “police officer” to something else and he’d be golden.  But what to turn him into?  A deer?  That was too big, if the officer panicked, he could do some real damage to Steve’s car.  A rat?  Too cruel.  Steve didn’t have any malus towards this officer – he didn’t want the officer to die or suffer unduly – the dude just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong.<br />
<br />
How about a fox?  Foxes had a decent lifespan and were small enough that a panicking fox didn’t pose any danger to Steve.  At the same time, a fox wouldn’t have to worry about every bird that flew overhead.  Yes, all Steve had to do was change “police officer” to “male fox” and…<br />
<br />
Steve felt an aura leaking out of his phone.  While he couldn’t see anything, he nonetheless got the sense that a black tendril had wormed its way out of the app and wrapped itself into his brain.<br />
<br />
Pregnant fox<br />
<br />
The thought forced its way into Steve’s mind, though he wasn’t sure if it was his own.  He did have a fetish for pregnant anthros, but did that really mean that he wanted to turn this cop into a pregnant fox?  The words fit – all Steve had to do was put them into the app and watch as the officer’s life irrevocably altered.  And was there really a difference between turning the man into a male fox or a pregnant one?  Either way, this human’s life was going up in fur.<br />
<br />
*Pregnant fox.*<br />
<br />
The thought was more forceful this time.  Still, it wasn’t a voice, not exactly.  It was more like a distant echo of an idea worming its way into his brain.  Again, Steve wondered whether this was what he wanted or… if it was what the app wanted?<br />
<br />
Steve took a deep breath, then muttered, “don’t tell me that the furry with a fetish for pregnant girls got hooked up with a sentient app with a fetish for the exact same thing…”<br />
<br />
If anything, the idea that it was the app that wanted this made Steve all the more willing to do it.  After all, the slightest error in logic could give the app an opening to ruin his life.  On the other hand, if this thing really was sentient and Steve fed it victims, then it would probably be a lot more inclined to interpret Steve’s changes in a way that was positive for him, if not anyone else.  <br />
<br />
“Fine, you win,” Steve said as he made the changes and watched the sentence reform on the screen:<br />
<br />
“The pregnant fox is walking up to Steve’s car.”<br />
<br />
*Tap Tap Tap*<br />
<br />
Steve heard the officers knuckle knocking on his window.  Rolling it down, he managed a “what’s wrong officer” before Steve got his first look at the man whose life he had just changed forever.<br />
<br />
The cop had been a beast of a man – in his mid 20’s, he was easily six foot two and two hundred pounds of muscle.  But the cop’s formerly brown hair was rapidly shifting to a brilliant tone of crimson, all while his ears grew triangular and migrated to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
“Do you know how fast you were gYIIPPing?”  Steve knew that the last word was supposed to be ‘going’, but instead it had come out as a strange hybrid of that word and a fox bark.  The odd sound wasn’t lost on the officer either, who tried to clear his throat as he moved a balled fist in front of it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the now five foot five officer, there wasn’t anything in the back of his throat.  And from the shrinking bulge at the front of the officer’s pants, he was in the final stages of becoming a she.<br />
<br />
The officer’s clothes began to evaporate away, revealing a thick coat of brilliant red fur underneath.  Looking at the officer, Steve said the only thing that came to mind, “No disrespect sir but did you realize that you’re a… fox right now?”<br />
<br />
“Yyyi’m rwaa fwoxxxiiiip?” came the muddle voice of the shrinking fox.  <br />
<br />
A muzzle began to push out of the cop’s face.  No doubt the sensation of that, combined with the foxlike gibberish that had just come out of the cop’s mouth caused the soon to be vixen to bring his hands to his muzzle.  But no sooner had his hands brushed against the tip of the cop’s now foxy nose than Steve heard the cracking of bones heralding the man’s fingers shrinking down into fox paws.<br />
<br />
More cracking could be heard as a tail exploded out from behind the almost-vixen and the bone structure of her lower body began to visually change.  Getting one last look at the teetering fox’s underside, Steve noticed eight engorged, black nipples poking through the dense white fur on her stomach.  And by this point Steve was fairly sure that the vixen was, in fact, a full she – while Steve couldn’t see the fox’s genitals, the fact is that he should have been able to see a sheath if it was there, despite the vixen’s plush fur.<br />
<br />
The former human fell to all fours as her belly began to bloat out with a dozen little fox kits.  Overwhelmed by the sensations, the vixen laid down on her side and took a moment to just stare at her puffed out belly.  From Steve’s vantage point, the size of the vixen’s belly made it obvious that she was not only gravid, but that she was due any day now.  From the vixen’s vantage point, the deep aching in her abdomen, combined with the feeling of dozens of kicking legs and squirming tails inside of her was a confusing and alien sensation.<br />
<br />
Then, as if sensing a loss of sensation where “his” dick should be, the vixen managed to bring her snout to her crotch – despite the full womb which limited her mobility.  What she found wasn’t the cock that she expected but, rather, a small moist hole situated just below her asshole.<br />
<br />
“Yip!”  she cried out in fear, “Yip! Yip!”<br />
<br />
The vixen looked Steve straight in the eyes as if to ask “what’s happening to me?  Why is my body so… wrong?”  But all that came out of her mouth were more frightened yips.<br />
<br />
Steve sighed, the least he could do was let her know what happened.  “Can you understand me?”  The vixen nodded.<br />
<br />
“Alright then I’m going to be straight with.  I got this new app on my phone but it’s not really an app, it’s more like an evil genie.  It lets me change reality and, sorry, but you kind of just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”<br />
<br />
The vixen just sat on her side, soaking up Steve’s words as though they might help her to change back. <br />
<br />
“The app wanted me to change you into a pregnant vixen and, believe me, it just changed me into a rabbit that was in labor, so I know what you’re about to go through.  I don’t want to end up like that again so, again, I’m sorry but I did what the app wanted.”<br />
<br />
Steve hadn’t told the small, pregnant animal that Steve had actually been an anthro rabbit, whereas the former cop would be living out the rest of her life as a feral fox, but Steve wasn’t sure that was a distinction that was worth explaining to an animal.  He also realized that he’d just told this vixen quite a bit.  While she didn’t seem to be able to speak, she could still understand English and it stood to reason that she would be able to write English as well.  <br />
<br />
That was a problem – what if she found someone who realized they could communicate with her, and she told them everything that Steve had just told her?<br />
<br />
“Ding.”<br />
<br />
“Can you speak English?”  Steve closed his eyes and let out a deep breath.  Hopefully that would set the app up for what he needed to do next.  A litany of yips erupted from the vixen and, sure enough, the newly generated sentence was perfect:<br />
<br />
“The pregnant vixen is trying to speak English.”<br />
<br />
Steve selected the words “trying to” and changed them to “can’t understand”.  When the sentence reformed, it read:<br />
<br />
“The pregnant vixen can’t understand or speak English.”  It didn’t feel good to do that, but what choice did Steve have?<br />
<br />
The vixen kept yapping as Steve laid back in his chair.  Now all he needed to do was to deal with the police car and he’d be good to go.  Another minute elapsed before another ding came from the app.  Steve selected the police car and generated a sentence:<br />
<br />
“The police car is sitting on the side of the road.”<br />
<br />
Steve wasn’t sure how many instincts the cop’s new vulpine and extremely pregnant body came with, so Steve had an idea.  He didn’t want the cop to starve or get eaten, so he decided to give the former officer a friend.  <br />
<br />
Steve selected the words “police car” and changed them to “protective tod”.  A few seconds later, the cop car had turned into another fox that was staring defensively at the confused vixen next to Steve’s car.<br />
<br />
Hopefully he takes care of her, Steve thought, as he turned the car back on and continued towards his apartment.</p>
