<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle&#39;s father bought and flipped old houses for a living.  This of course entailed cleaning said houses, and removing old junk, a task Danielle had been set to since she was little.  She didn&#39;t mind, having inherited her Dad&#39;s love of hard work (as opposed to her witch of a mother, who detested work of any kind).  She loved to help out, even if that meant spending her days in dusty attics like this one.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d sorted through the items the previous owners had left.  Mostly junk, some sentimental value, but one or two items that could make some money at auction.  At 17, Danielle was a girl of average height, her short blonde hair held out of her eyes by a bandanna.  She was toned, but not overly muscular, and, as she often did during the summer months, had a nice healthy tan.  Green eyes could be seen behind her glasses, and she was pretty, though nothing like her mother, who was a fashion model.  She wore ratty old jeans, a Metallica concert t that had seen better years (it was starting to get a few holes in it), and sneakers.<br />
<br />
Now that the floor was cleared, she saw a chalk design on the floor, and some melted candle stumps.  &quot;Aw jeez, another New Age freak.  Tryin&#39; t&#39; summon the Devil, yah?&quot;  She shook her head.  Even though she hadn&#39;t lived in Minnesota in years, she sometimes lapsed into sounding like Marge Gunderson.<br />
<br />
She got her cleaning materials ready and inspected the circle.  It was hard to make out some of they symbols, they were marred and broken, and there was even a hand print in the chalk dust.  The story had gone that the previous tenants had their young son commit suicide downstairs- it stood to reason he was into this stuff.<br />
<br />
A sensible girl whose only brush with the occult was her monthly D&D game, Danielle Western didn&#39;t take much stock in the supernatural.  She was about to have a rude awakening!  The instant she touched the circle, an unseen wind whipped through the room, and the Duke of Hell, Gemory, made her dramatic appearance!<br />
<br />
&quot;Tremble in fear, mortals, for it is I, the Duke of Hell, Gemory!&quot;  Gemory appeared with her usual aplomb and grandeur...made less impressive by the fact that she was over a foot shorter than the last time she&#39;d graced this attic.  Toni, who had quickly become her favorite concubine and pay earner had long since shown her the advantages of being a shorter girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yah?!  And who are you supposed to be?&quot;  Danielle was surprised, but despite being on the back foot, she wasn&#39;t about to be intimidated by a short cheerleader!  &quot;An&#39; put some clothes on, will ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory sighed.  &quot;Oh good grief.  A girl, and a straight one at that!  Didn&#39;t you hear?  Gemory, Duke of Hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duchess.&quot;  Dani corrected.  &quot;If you&#39;re a girl, you&#39;re a Duchess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a MAN, you bespectacled commoner!&quot;  Gemory stamped her tiny foot in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yah?  Lookin&#39; like that?  I don&#39;t see no surgery scars.&quot;  Danielle folded her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.  This is going so wrong.  Everything was so easier last time!  Look, whether you like it or not, I have three wishes to give you, then I&#39;ll be on my way.&quot;  Gemory pouted cutely.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh three wishes, is it?  And let me guess, each one will be cursed.  Like I&#39;ll wish to be rich and my Dad will keel over dead of a heart attack and I get insurance money?  No thanks, I&#39;ll take a live old man over a dead one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite herself, Gemory was starting to like the level-headed teen.  &quot;Well I&#39;m afraid you don&#39;t have any choice.   You&#39;re going to get the three wishes the last idiot asked for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oofta.  Why didn&#39;t he use them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory smiled like a cat.  &quot;He was a little busy at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, let me guess, he summoned you to fuck you?&quot;  The girl made a face.<br />
<br />
&quot;For evil&#39;s sake, girl, am I that repulsive to you?&quot;  Gemory whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  No, yer fine, girl like you would make my bitch of a mother explode in jealousy.  Just...boys...ugh.  The only one worth a damn is my old man and Gramps.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh ho, maybe not as straight as I thought!&#39; Gemory grinned.  &quot;Well be that as it may, since he ended up paying for the wishes, someone has to get them.  And that someone...is you!  Congratulations!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yah?  I don&#39;t get a say at all?&quot;  Dani frowned.  &quot;Seems like I should be allowed t&#39; refuse!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, please?  They aren&#39;t bad wishes, I swear!&quot;  Gemory made the Boy Scout salute.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just told me you&#39;re a Devil!  Why should I believe you?&quot;  Danielle was exasperated.  &quot;And seriously, put a shirt on or something!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fine, fine.  You know, most people would enjoy looking at me.  I don&#39;t mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yah yah, you&#39;re a bloody exhibitionist.&quot;  Dani looked away...or tried to.  Gemory did have the sort of beauty that would make a dead man horny, and even the straightest of women would find themselves lusting for her.  Danielle was neither of those things, as much as she pretended otherwise.<br />
<br />
Gemory snapped her fingers and she was now wearing an oversized men&#39;s flannel shirt...and nothing else.  &quot;Is this better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mite.&quot;  Danielle sighed.  &quot;So about refusing what you&#39;re selling...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;ll make a concession here, but only because I like you.  Accept these wishes and I&#39;ll grant you a boon.  Not a wish, but more like...a service.&quot;  Gemory bargained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I refuse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory sighed.  &quot;Then we have to go to court.  Though you know what they say about lawyers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oofta.  Yah, they all go to your place when they die.  Fine, I can put you to work.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&#39;Put me to work?  What does she have in mind?&#39;  Gemory wondered, but she was happy to get this over with and find someone who appreciated her body.  &quot;Very well!  The wishes!&quot;<br />
<br />
She snapped her fingers, and Tony&#39;s disembodied voice could be heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so wish one! I wish I would enjoy perfect health and never age nor falter...and that women would find me cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish two! I wish I would have the power to make any woman I touch fall unconditionally in love with me, and want to have sex with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I would also have the power to make any woman I touch prettier, younger, smaller, or have bigger tits!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oofta...you got to be kidding me!?&quot;  Danielle blinked.  She felt a tingling all over her body, as her features subtly began to change, making her quite attractive.  She didn&#39;t feel any healthier (as she already had a good stamina).<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you really are a cutie.&quot;  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
Danielle turned to face the old mirror, wiping off the dust to see more clearly.  The demoness was right, even she had to admit she was kind of adorable.  &quot;Won&#39;t people notice that I just got instant plastic surgery?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft!  People only notice what they want to notice.  Besides, it&#39;s only women who will be more attracted to you.&quot;  Gemory waved that off.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the other powers?  How do they work?&quot;  Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just touch the target and speak your desire.  I&#39;m not sure how your powers will work on trans women, but it should be fun to find...&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle moved forward and put her hand on Gemory&#39;s head.  &quot;Fall in love with me!&quot;, she said.<br />
<br />
Gemory blinked.  As stated, despite her insistence that she was male, even she thought of herself as a girl.  Instantly, she found per perceptions clouded.  She really wanted to get Danielle naked and...  &quot;Gah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!  Bet you didn&#39;t think that one through!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory pouted.  &quot;You&#39;re mean!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle paused, admitting that she maybe had gone too far.  &quot;Yeah...but you&#39;re a demon...I bet you killed that Tony kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory sniffled.  &quot;It&#39;s true, I&#39;m evil.  But now I&#39;m going to be laughed out of Hell!  A Duke of Hell, falling in love with a mortal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  Danielle looked down at her shoes.  &quot;Can I take it back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  Damn you!  I hate that I want to forgive you and just hug and kiss you forever!&quot;  Gemory stamped her little foot.  She was angry at herself, but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to be angry at the girl (whom she now loved).  Fortunately, she WAS a demon, so it wasn&#39;t a huge setback.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not sure about the kisses, but you do look kind of huggable.&quot;  Dani admitted.<br />
<br />
With that, Gemory stepped forward and put her arms around Danielle.  &#39;Hm, she&#39;s a bit skinny.  A bit too much muscle for my taste.  But she&#39;s got a good heart.  Augh, what am I thinking?&#39;<br />
<br />
The two embraced for a bit, before Danielle stood back.  &quot;Well, now what am I going to do with you?  I can&#39;t very well ask you to leave, that&#39;d be cruel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory grinned up at the girl.  &quot;I guess you&#39;ll have to let your girlfriend move in with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girlfriend!?&quot;  Dani yelped.  &quot;My Dad doesn&#39;t know I like girls!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory wanted to jump for joy.  &#39;Ha, I knew it!&#39;  But instead she just pouted at Danielle, since this was a proven strategy.  &quot;I don&#39;t take up much space, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll like me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, my mom burned him badly.  He always says, &#39;avoid the pretty ones, Dani, they&#39;ll break your heart&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory frowned.  Breaking Dani&#39;s heart was the last thing she wanted to do!  &quot;Well, I mean, I&#39;m rich, does that help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yah?  How rich?&quot;  Danielle considered that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think Jeff Bezos is going when he dies?&quot;  Gemory grinned.  &quot;My palace in Hell is full of the treasures of evil men and women, who all serve me in the afterlife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.  Well if you can pitch in rent and stuff, that might be an easier sell.  But you&#39;re going to have to work.  I won&#39;t have a girl who is afraid to break a nail be my girlfriend.&quot;   Danielle tried to sound stern, but Gemory was really cute.  And when she pouted, ugh, that did things to her that she didn&#39;t like to think about!<br />
<br />
&quot;Work?  Huh.  Well I don&#39;t usually have to get physical, but I&#39;m much stronger than I look, and have...tireless stamina.&quot;  She emphasized those last two words, her voice becoming low and sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oofta, stop it, you damn succubus!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  I&#39;m not mere succubus, I&#39;ll have you know!  I&#39;m upper management, they work for me!&quot;  Gemory folded her arms, nearly insulted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my bad, I don&#39;t know much about demons other than what the Monster Manual says.  My family isn&#39;t really religious.  What is the difference?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Succubi are tempters and seducers, two things I am quite good at, but their powers are more limited.  Not much magic, more than what you need to shapeshift or conjure up a sexy outfit.  They can lay on the charm though.  Terrible fliers, even though they have wings, and not great in a fight...usually.  They basically have to function as middle men for a stronger demon to procure souls.  Also, they need to snack on mortal lifeforce from time to time or they become weak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oofta, lifeforce?  So they age you...or level drain, like what my Dad says D&D used to be like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gemory waved that off.  &quot;That&#39;s only if they are starving.  Generally the energy of fantastic sex is enough they can take a few nibbles on a lover&#39;s stamina and the emotions generated by the afterglow.  Nothing you&#39;d notice unless you were in very bad health.  But a demon like myself, with thousands of souls under her belt, is fully self-sustaining.  Though I might nibble from time to time, it IS enjoyable.  Like a pie from Baker&#39;s Square.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani blinked.  &quot;You eat real food?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!  Good food can be just as seductive as a pair of nice breasts you know.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean...you can cook?&quot;  Dani got a strange look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of my lesser talents, yes...why are you looking at me like that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle had tears in her eyes.  &quot;Dad and I can&#39;t cook for nothing!  If you can give me good home cooked meals, I&#39;ll marry you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;She probably doesn&#39;t mean that...but that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t take the advantage!&#39;, Gemory thought.  &quot;I accept!&quot;  She snapped her fingers and a pair of diamond engagement rings appeared on both girl&#39;s fingers.<br />
<br />
Dani just gaped at the ring.  &quot;Wait...what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, darling!&quot;  Gemory hugged her fiancee.  &quot;We&#39;re engaged!&quot;</p>
