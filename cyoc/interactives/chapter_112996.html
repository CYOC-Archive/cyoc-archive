<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The world around Josh blurred and he felt wind rushing around him in all directions. Soon he could feel the wind against his bare skin as his clothes disappeared. He could tell his body was changing shape but couldn&#39;t tell through all the other sensations what changes exactly were taking place, though the wind felt especially good against his crotch and his chest.<br />
<br />
Then, as suddenly as it had started, the wind stopped and the world came back into focus. Josh stared up at his ceiling and realized he was laying on his floor, apparently having fallen sometime while the changes were happening. <br />
<br />
He propped himself up on his elbows as he prepared to sit up and felt an unfamiliar weight shift and tug at his chest. Looking down to find the source of the weight he saw two large mounds, each capped off with a pink nipple. He fell back to the ground in shock and they bounced on his again chest as they settled into their new position. He raised his head to look at them and this time he felt an abnormally large amount of hair move with him. <br />
<br />
With a pit beginning to form in his stomach, Josh moved a hand to feel one of &quot;his&quot; new breasts.As he reached for the breast he saw that his hands were now small, dainty, and well-manicured. He gripped &quot;his&quot; boob tentatively, afraid of finding out it was real. &quot;His&quot; fingers sank easily into the mass of titflesh as they squeezed, then he began slowly moving it around and running &quot;his&quot; hand over its ample surface, jiggling it slightly, confirming it was attached to him. Then he noticed a new problem.<br />
<br />
The boob was more sensitive than he would&#39;ve expected, and it felt good when he played with it. So good that it sent blood rushing to his crotch, and he suddenly noticed that he couldn&#39;t feel his junk between his legs. Instead it felt like &quot;he&quot; had a second pair of lips where his balls should&#39;ve been, and they were now very warm and swelling up along with --what felt like-- the world&#39;s smallest dick. There was also a feeling of butterflies in his stomach and a particular feeling of emptiness between his legs.<br />
<br />
Propped up on his elbows again, Josh looked down to the spot where he was used to seeing his dick. Just to be sure he even reached a hand down, but all that hand found were moist folds of skin and his fears were confirmed. &quot;He&quot; wasn&#39;t a &quot;he&quot; anymore.<br />
<br />
Josh sat up on the floor. She couldn&#39;t help but notice the conspicuous absence of her balls against the hard surface as she sat on it. Instead it was her lower lips that kissed the ground she sat on. The cool wood even felt pretty good against her warm opening, but she wasn&#39;t sure she should enjoy it. She crossed her fingers and prepared to turn herself  back, but as she opened her mouth she saw the mirror on the wall and her curiosity got the better of her. <br />
<br />
Josh&#39;s new proportions and weight distribution (her heavy new tits, especially) meant that it took her a minute to figure out how to stand without toppling over. Looking down at her feet to be sure she had control over them, she thought the floor looked closer than she was used to. Slowly, so she wouldn&#39;t lose her balance, She took a quick glance around the room. None of her furniture was the same as it was before the change, but it seemed to her like it, and the room, were all bigger than they should be.<br />
<br />
She saw the mirror across the room again and began, tentatively, to walk towards it watching her feet the whole way. If she tried to move like she was used to, she would stumble and have to catch herself. This body just wasn&#39;t built to move that way. As she walked though she began to find how her new body was built to move. She needed to hold her body differently, and to take shorter steps, and to swing her hips more than she did before, but by the time she reached the mirror she could walk and stand without feeling like she was constantly about to lose her balance.<br />
<br />
She looked up at the mirror to inspect her new body properly, but first something had to be done about her tits.<br />
<br />
 They looked to be about the perfect size, but without proper support their size made them floppy and unattractive. So she crossed her fingers and said, &quot;female&#39;s bodies naturally support their breasts as well as a perfect bra did in the old reality, but their breasts are still just as soft and bouncy as ever. And big breasts are just as perky as little ones and don&#39;t cause any long-term issues or discomfort for the woman who has them.&quot; It was the first time Josh heard her new voice. It was cutely  but not annoyingly high-pitched, and with a sort of natural melody to it.<br />
<br />
Her boobs blurred for a second in the reflection and she felt wind rushing around them. When they came back into focus Josh had a pair of perfectly round melons jutting out of her chest. She even kind-of had cleavage now, she noted looking down. She reached up to give one an experimental squeeze and it was as soft as before. Then just for fun she jumped up and watched them bounce, happy that the bouncing wasn&#39;t as uncomfortable as earlier. She thought her balance might&#39;ve even improved.<br />
<br />
Now she could inspect her reflection properly. She was a cute brunette with blue eyes, and her lips were full and pink, and looked soft. She ran a finger across her bottom lip to test and not only was she correct about their softness, they were sensitive and felt good being touched. <br />
<br />
Josh turned around to inspect her ass and couldn&#39;t have been happier with what she saw. Her backside stuck out noticeably from her back, when viewed from the side was a nice half circle shape, and it was beautifully round. She rubbed and grabbed her ass experimentally, it was pleasantly soft to touch, but with a noticeable firmness too it. A man couldn&#39;t ask for a better ass.<br />
<br />
She turned back to face the mirror again. Then reached up to take it off the wall and it was heavier than she expected. Why was eveything so big now? She nearly lost her grip while setting it on the floor. <br />
<br />
Josh sat on her soft ass, scooted close to the mirror and spread her legs apart in front of it. This was the first time she&#39;d ever seen a naked woman outside of porn and she wanted to get a close look at a pussy while she had the chance, even if it was hers and even she shouldn&#39;t have one at all. It was right here and Josh wanted to see it. <br />
<br />
She looked down at it in the mirror and used her hands to spread her lips apart. It didn&#39;t look all that different from the ones she&#39;d seen in porn but it seemed so much better in person. It also felt good with hands on it. She rubbed her fingers up and down her lips and moaned slightly. Then Josh realized what she was doing and her breasts bounced as she jumped back to her feet.<br />
<br />
She crossed her fingers and got ready to make herself a man again. As she opened her mouth though she caught sight of her reflection. Cute face, cute voice, great tits, great ass, flat stomach, toned legs, tiny hands and feet. Josh even realized looking over her reflection why everything seemed so big, she couldn&#39;t have been more than 5&#39;1. Everything about the girl in the mirror was Josh&#39;s physical ideal, he couldn&#39;t just wish her away forever could he?<br />
<br />
But he couldn&#39;t stay like this anymore. He was a man and he wanted to be able to properly enjoy his fantasy-made-reality. It was fun while it lasted but it was time to turn back, and make sure nothing like this happened again.<br />
<br />
So Josh closed her eyes, crossed her fingers, and said, &quot;From now on I can never not be,&quot; she opened her eyes and took one last look at the girl in the mirror, saying goodbye to the most beautiful girl she had ever seen and his libido got the better of him, &quot;this girl.&quot;</p>
