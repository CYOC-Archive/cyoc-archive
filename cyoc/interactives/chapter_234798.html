<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jim burst out of Spells &#39;R Us, his heart pounding with excitement, he barely heard the old man&#39;s parting words. He clutched the deflated red balloon in his hand, already envisioning the endless possibilities. He was so lost in thought that he didn&#39;t notice Jeff, a boy around his age, standing nearby with a mischievous grin on his face. Jeff had seen Jim exit the strange shop, and he&#39;d noticed the peculiar balloon clutched in his hand. He&#39;d always been curious about the little store, but his parents had forbidden him from entering. Now, seeing Jim emerge with something so unusual, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a pang of jealousy. Jim was so engrossed in his thoughts that he didn&#39;t see Jeff following him at a distance. He walked straight to the mall&#39;s main concourse, where people were bustling about their shopping. <br />
<br />
He spotted his sister Erika, a year older than him, walking with her friends. She was always so prim and proper, the perfect little lady. Jim couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the thought of what he was about to do. He hid behind a pillar, inflated the balloon with six breaths, and said “Control Erika&#39;s morals and decency.”<br />
<br />
He let the balloon deflate slowly, a wicked grin spreading across his face. As the last bit of air left the balloon, he said, Release. Erika stopped mid-sentence, her friends looking at her expectantly. Then, something strange happened. Her cheeks turned a shade of red Jim had never seen before. She looked around furtively, then suddenly dashed towards the middle of the concourse. Jim watched in disbelief as Erika dropped to her knees, right there in the middle of the mall. She began to pull at her pants, struggling to get them down. People started to notice, pointing and whispering. Erika didn&#39;t seem to care. She finally managed to get her pants down, and with a grunt, she began to defecate right there on the shiny mall floor. Chaos erupted. People screamed and ran away, covering their noses. Security guards rushed towards Erika, their faces a mix of shock and disgust. Jim watched, frozen in place, as they grabbed Erika by the arms and dragged her away, her pants still around her ankles. <br />
<br />
Jim looked down at the balloon in his hand, realization dawning on his face. He hadn&#39;t meant for this to happen. He&#39;d just wanted to see if it worked, to see if he could make Erika do something silly. But he&#39;d never imagined... He felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around to see Jeff standing there with his short blonde hair and mildly athletic build , a smirk on his face. <br />
<br />
“Pretty powerful stuff you&#39;ve got there” Jeff said, nodding towards the balloon. <br />
“I&#39;m Jeff, by the way. I think we should be friends.”<br />
<br />
Evil thoughts started churning in Jim’s mind he had enough friends but he could use companionship. Jim smirked, an idea forming in his mind. “Hey, Jeff” Jim said, feigning friendliness. “I&#39;ve got something to show you.”<br />
<br />
 Jeff raised an eyebrow but followed Jim to a quiet corner near the restrooms. Jim held up the balloon, explaining its power with exaggerated gestures. Jeff listened, skepticism etched on his face. “You expect me to believe that thing can change people?”<br />
<br />
Jeff scoffed. Jim grinned mischievously. Watch. Jim smirked “control Jeff’s ass size” He inflated the balloon with six breaths before saying release and then releasing the air. Jeff yelped as his jeans had suddenly tightened, his ass growing rounder and fuller.  “Hey! What did you do that for?” Jeff exclaimed, trying to adjust his pants. Jim just laughed. <br />
“I can make it bigger, or I can make it smaller” he taunted. “Or maybe I should give you long hair like a girl?”<br />
<br />
 Jeff&#39;s hands flew to his short-cropped hair, panic in his eyes.  “No, don&#39;t!”<br />
<br />
 Jim chuckled, enjoying the power he held. Then come with me, he said, leading Jeff towards a clothing boutique. <br />
<br />
“I want to see you in something.”<br />
<br />
 Jeff hesitated but followed Jim into the store, his face red with embarrassment. Jim pushed him towards the dressing rooms, handing him a selection of skimpy bikinis. <br />
“Put these on.” Jim ordered. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the bikinis, then back at Jim, horror in his eyes. “You can&#39;t be serious.” Jim held up the balloon, a wicked grin on his face. <br />
<br />
“Do you want to test my seriousness?” Defeated, Jeff took the bikinis and disappeared into a dressing room. Jim waited impatiently, tapping his foot deciding that Jeff had took too long Jim says “Control Jeff’s hair style length.”<br />
He blew five long breaths into the red balloon before releasing the effect and then the air.<br />
<br />
Finally, the door opened, and Jeff stepped out, sobbing softly. He was wearing a skimpy pink bikini, his long, blonde hair cascading down his back. His boyish body was lean but toned, the bikini leaving little to the imagination. Jim whistled appreciatively. <br />
“You look great, Jeff!”<br />
<br />
he said, fighting back laughter. “Now, turn around and show me your ass.”<br />
 Jeff hesitated, then turned slowly, his juicy ass being groped by an increasingly deranged Jim as he hissed out a compliment “Niiice.” Jim, grinning like a Cheshire cat, led Jeff back into the dressing room, pushing him inside and closing the door behind them. Jeff stood there, tears streaming down his cheeks, the skimpy pink bikini clinging to his body. <br />
<br />
Jim couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the sight. “What&#39;s wrong, Jeff? Don&#39;t you like your new look?”<br />
<br />
 Jim taunted, circling him like a predator. Jeff whirled around, his face red with anger and embarrassment. “This is ridiculous, Jim! You can&#39;t just... just do this to people!”<br />
<br />
Jim stopped, his grin fading. “Oh, I think I can..”<br />
<br />
 he said, holding up the balloon. “And I will. Now, take off that bikini and put on this one.”<br />
<br />
 He threw a tiny, neon yellow bikini at Jeff. Jeff caught it, his hands shaking.  “No way, Jim. You can&#39;t make me!”<br />
<br />
Jim&#39;s eyes narrowed. “Oh, really? Well, how about this?” He inflated the balloon with several big breaths, his mind focusing on Jeff&#39;s crotch. <br />
<br />
“Control Jeff&#39;s genitals” he said, releasing the air. Jeff yelped as he felt the front of his bikini bottoms suddenly loosened . He looked down in horror as his groin began to shrink his once very impressive cock and testicles atrophy and wither into nothing , Jeff uncomfortably adjusted his bikini as his cock and balls disappeared into his body leaving an inverted piss hole. He was left with a smooth, hairless mons pubis, looking like a prepubescent girl. <br />
<br />
“Jim, please!” Jeff begged, tears flowing freely now. “Please, stop this!”<br />
<br />
Jim just laughed, enjoying the power he held over Jeff.  “Not until you put on this bikini.”  he said, holding it up again. “And maybe not even then..”<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated, then snatched the bikini from Jim&#39;s hand Jim exited the dressing room as Jeff quickly put it on, trying to cover his relatively hairless toned boyish body as much as possible. Jim watched, grinning, as Jeff struggled to adjust the tiny triangles of fabric.<br />
<br />
 “There you go.” Jim said peeking into the room, clapping his hands together.  “Now, let&#39;s see how you look.” <br />
<br />
Jeff took a deep breath and stepped out of the dressing room, his eyes downcast. Jim whistled appreciatively, walking around Jeff, inspecting him like a piece of meat. “You know what?”<br />
<br />
 Jim said, stopping in front of Jeff. <br />
“I think you look even better in this one. But I think we can make it even better.” <br />
<br />
Jeff looked up at him, fear in his eyes.  “What do you mean?”  Jim just smiled, holding up the balloon. You&#39;ll see. “Control Jeff’s breast size!”<br />
<br />
Blowing four solid breaths into the balloon Jim released the effect.  The neon yellow bikini top strained against Jeff&#39;s chest, his boyish frame now sporting a pair of B-cup breasts that threatened to spill out at any moment. Jim had made sure of that, using the balloon to inflate Jeff&#39;s chest until it was round and firm. Jeff stood there, tears streaming down his face, his hands cupping his new breasts self-consciously.<br />
<br />
“ Jim, please, he begged, You can&#39;t do this to me. I&#39;m a guy!”<br />
<br />
 Jim just laughed, enjoying the sight of Jeff&#39;s discomfort. <br />
“Not anymore, Stephanie. You&#39;re my new girlfriend now.” <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes widened in horror.  “No, Jim! I&#39;m not gay! And I&#39;m definitely not your girlfriend!” Jim&#39;s smile faded, his eyes narrowing. <br />
<br />
“Oh, yes you are, Stephanie.” he said, his voice cold.  “And if you don&#39;t start acting like it, I&#39;ll make sure your family gets punished.”<br />
Jeff hesitated, then looked down at his new body, a shudder running through him. <br />
“What do you want me to do?” <br />
he asked softly. Jim grinned again, his eyes gleaming with mischief. <br />
<br />
“Well, for starters, you can tell me how pretty you are. Come on, Stephanie. Don&#39;t be shy!”<br />
 Jeff took a deep breath, then looked up at Jim, his face red with embarrassment.  “I... I&#39;m pretty.”  he said softly. Jim clapped his hands together, delighted.  “Louder, Stephanie! I want everyone to hear.”  Jeff looked around nervously, then took a deep breath and shouted, “I&#39;m pretty!”<br />
<br />
Jim laughed, patting Jeff on the back.  “That&#39;s my girl!” he said.<br />
<br />
 “Now, let&#39;s go find you some makeup and book you an appointment at the salon. I want everyone to see my new girlfriend looking her best.”<br />
<br />
 Jeff hesitated, then followed Jim out of the changing room, his new breasts bouncing with each step. He felt a sense of dread wash over him as he realized that he was completely at Jim&#39;s mercy. He had no idea what horrors awaited him next, but he knew one thing for sure - he had to play along if he wanted to survive this nightmare. As they walked through the mall, Jim kept up a tastefully devious steady stream of taunts and commands, making Jeff say things like I love being a girl and I can&#39;t wait to have sex with Jim. Jeff felt his stomach churn with each word, but he knew he had no choice but to obey. He was no longer Jeff - he was Stephanie, Jim&#39;s new girlfriend, and he had to play the part if he wanted to live through this.</p>
