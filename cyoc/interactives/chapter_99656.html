<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want to do this,” Millie said to her manager.<br />
“Absolutely not,” cried the manager. “There is no way I’ll let you throw your life away!”<br />
“I’m not throwing it away, Mr. Cully,” Millie argued, “I’m just going to make it better.”<br />
“This is crazy,” the manager said, “I can’t believe you’re actually falling for that nonsense, and you want to turn yourself into some weird robot girl.”<br />
Millie knew her manager well enough to assume that he would be stubborn, after all, he was like a father to her ever since she first met him at the orphanage more than a year ago.<br />
“For the past year or so since we came together, I’ve respected your decisions,” Mr. Cully continued, “I agreed to let you write your own songs. I understood that you didn’t want to change your appearance too drastically, and keep your real name. I supported you when you were feeling intimidated in your first concert. What I don’t respect, is the weird robo girls acting like us humans.”<br />
“They’re not weird robo girls,” Millie argued, “They’re living beings, just like us, and the proper term is gynoid, or inorganic intelligence.”<br />
“I can’t believe what I’m hearing,” Mr. Cully commented. “You don’t know for sure if that’ll be the real you that comes out of that thing.”<br />
“Maybe,” said Millie, “but talking to 402 yesterday, she reminded me of who she used to be so much… only happier.”<br />
<br />
----One day ago ----<br />
<br />
402 was spending the day doing sketches of her fellow sisters in everyday life. It became a hobby of hers when not helping 601 design new buildings at her new architectural firm. As she thinking by the nanosecond on what to sketch next, she heard her doorbell ring. Since no one else was home at the moment, she decided to stop what she was doing and answer the door. As she opened it she was immediately surprised by the sight of an old friend, Millie Ellenboro.<br />
402 first met Millie 5 years ago, back when she was still a boy named Shen Huang. They met at the Orphanage Millie was living in. When Millie was a little girl her parents died in a car accident, and she had no one else to take care of her. One day, Shen came to the orphanage to donate some of his paintings, and met Millie Ellenboro when she was singing to herself. Shen loved her singing, was the one who encouraged Millie to sing for the other orphans. It was about a year ago when a music manager by the name of Cully noticed her singing, and decided to adopt Millie as her legal guardian. The following year Millie and Shen had sent eachother emails so they could keep in touch. However, when the gynoid 9901 arrived in their home town. It didn’t take long for news of Shen and his family’s conversion into gynoid sisters to reach Millie.<br />
Millie herself was shocked to see the silver gynoid with green accented lights, especially since she noticed a resemblance to the boy she knew. She took up the courage to say something to the gynoid after a moment of silence. “Is it you? Is that really you She-?”<br />
“It is, Millie,” 402 said with a soft smile, “but I don’t go by Shen anymore, for obvious reasons. I go by 200402/Art now, or just 402. I’m so happy to see you, Millie.”<br />
The two hugged each other tightly for a moment, tears in their eyes as they were glad to be reunited.<br />
After Millie and 402 went inside, the two talked about how their lives have changed. The conversation was mostly one-sided as 402 was the one who changed the most. 402 told Millie about how her family met 600 in her new form, how things got very embarrassing when she (then he) first saw her then mother and sister as gynoids for the first time. She gushed about meeting then future sisters from across the stars via the device 600 created, and how she took the plunge in the conversion chamber and how great it felt. 402 then describe as best as she could how she felt the love of all her sisters welcomed her upon her conversion, and how happy she felt, say that it can’t be understood until experienced.<br />
Millie couldn’t help but be amazed upon hearing 402’s story, seeing how happy she is with her life. “I saw the new church you and your um… sisters built,” Millie interrupted, “Was that mural on the wall your work?”<br />
“Yes it was,” 402 replied, “I managed to paint that entire wall with images based on the bible in just a few days without any sleep. I would have done the rest of the walls if not for my sisters dragging me out the door.”<br />
Millie gasped as she couldn’t believe the enthusiasm of 402’s last statement. “You… don’t need to sleep?” she asked.<br />
“I do, but just for a short time every week or so to, ‘charge up my batteries,’” 402 chuckled.<br />
“I never thought robot girls like you would be so full of energy, or so creative,” Millie commented.<br />
“We prefer something along the lines of gynoids, or inorganic intelligences as 9901 likes to call us,” 402 corrected. “The sisterhood prides itself on creativity and art, among other things. We also recognize and respect all religions across the universe. We even have a member of the spiritualist caste in town somewhere 950399/Spr or 399.”<br />
“I think I saw her on the ride here,” said Millie, “She was the gunmetal one with the deep orange lights, telling people about ‘the good news’. She seemed nice.”<br />
“She is,” 402 agreed. “So how’s your record deal going, and what are you doing back in town?”<br />
“I heard about what happened to you, and I wanted to see for myself,” Millie replied, “It’s not every day that a friend of yours gets turned into a robo- I mean gynoid. As for my record deal, it’s going well. We’ll be working on our second album soon, and hopefully start our first tour. I need to write some songs that seem right to me, but I can’t seem to find the inspiration. Part of the reason I came back to town was to hopefully get inspired by you guys.”<br />
402 was somewhat taken aback at what she just heard. She noticed something about Millie that suggested anxiety, or envy, or even a sort of love. With a sudden possibility popping into her head, she contacted one of her sisters.<br />
<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 200402/Art To: 9901/Ems: Sister, do you have a moment?&gt;<br />
…<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901/Ems To 200402/Art: I’m not busy today, what is it 402?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 200402/Art To: 9901/Ems: I believe I have someone willing to join us.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901/Ems To: 200402/Art: You do? :) Who is it?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 200402/Art To: 9901/Ems: I don’t know if you’ve heard of her yet. Her name is Millie Ellenboro. She’s a singer.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 312000/Arc To: [Ioc] I’ve heard her music. I’ll send you a link [Song: Millie Ellen: Freedom in the Sky]&gt;<br />
…<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901/Ems To: 200402/Art, 312000/Arc: She sounds beautiful XD, Thank you 2000.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 312000/Arc To: [Ioc]: it was my pleasure, dear sister.&gt;<br />
&lt; I.M. From: 200402/Art To: 9901/Ems: She and I have been friends for a long time. She’s with me right now, and I can tell she’s curious about our sisterhood. Is there as specific caste for people like her?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901/Ems To: 200402/Art: There is. Though I never would have thought I would see an addition to the Entertainer’s caste this soon. You can access the database for information about the caste if you’d like.&gt;<br />
&lt; I.M. From: 200402/Art To: 9901/Ems: Thank You sister. It might take time for a definite answer, but I’ll let you know when Millie makes a decision.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From 9901/Ems To: 200402/Art: Good luck, sister.&gt;<br />
*pipp*<br />
<br />
402 turned her attention back to Millie, who was taking a sip of tea at the moment. The conversation 9901 actually lasted a few seconds in real time, so Millie didn’t need to wait at all.<br />
“Millie,” 402 said suddenly, “Do you wish to JOIN me, as a sister?”<br />
Millie nearly choked on her tea upon hearing the question, struggling to put down the cup before saying something. “Me? Join you, and become a gynoid? I... I don’t know. I’m flattered by the offer, but I don’t know if there’s a place for people like me. I’m just an aspiring singer who writes her own songs. I just want to do what I love, and sing for whatever fans I have.”<br />
“Don’t worry,” said 402 while simultaneously examining the database through the link 9901 sent her, “I think you’ll fit right in with the entertainer caste.”<br />
“Entertainer?” Millie repeated.<br />
“Yes,” 402 confirmed, “Earth isn’t the only place to have sources of entertainment. There’s a specific caste of sisters who pride themselves on acting, dancing, performing with instruments, and of course singing. The best part of it is that entertainer’s often help each other through the headlink to improve their one another’s act, or inspire them with something new.”<br />
“Really?” Millie asked with an excited tone.<br />
“Yes,” said 402, “Although some sisters get a little competitive, but I’ve heard from my sister that they always keep it friendly.”<br />
“Your, sister?” Millie asked before realizing who 402 meant. “Oh, were you talking to each other with instant message or something?”<br />
“Uh-huh,” 402 replied, “It only takes a few seconds to you, but it takes an eternity’s worth of nanoseconds for me.”<br />
Millie burst out laughing the moment she heard 402 complaining about nanoseconds.<br />
<br />
---Present time---<br />
<br />
“After that, 402 and I talked some more,” Millie continued after she explained to Mr. Cully what she did yesterday. “When I decided to come home, she told me not to rush things, and take as long as I want before making my decision. I thought how I lost my parents, and how I don’t remember them that well, and how alone I’ve felt since then. I want to feel that love again; almost as much as I want to sing for my fans. So I’ve decided. I want to take the plunge, and join 402 and her sisters.”<br />
Mr. Cully was clearly frustrated with what he was hearing. He admitted, at one point, that the reporter that became Diplomat 9902 didn’t seem to be just a machine, especially after saving that old woman from the burning church. However, he had trouble understanding why Millie would want to be one of those them. “Millie,” he said with tears in his eyes, “I’ve looked after you and supported your career for over a year now. Since then, you’ve been like a daughter to me. I love you, and don’t want to risk losing you. I know I’m being a little selfish, but if you really want to do this, then I can’t stop you.”<br />
Millie started tearing up and hugged her manager, telling him, “Thank you, I know that neither of us won’t regret it.”<br />
<br />
--- The next day ---<br />
<br />
Emissary 9901, Archivist 2000, and Artisan 402 were all spending time at the gynoid embassy while waiting for Millie to arrive. 402 I.M.ed 9901 earlier today about Millie accepting the offer, making 9901 especially happy to meet her. After 402 arrived the three passed the time doing there own thing. In a room on the second floor, 402 painting a picture of 2000 who was plugged into a large computer the embassy had, so she could archive as many things as possible from the internet. Meanwhile, in the lobby, 9901 was listening to Millie’s songs in her headlink. <br />
It was a little past noon when 9901 saw Millie and her manager, Mr. Cully, walk in. Turning off the music in her headlink, she quickly informed the others as she approached Millie. “It’s so good to finally meet you, Miss Ellenboro,” she said, “I’ve been listening to your music lately, and I must say, your voice is beautiful.”<br />
“Thank you,” a blushed Millie said, “I’m always happy to meet a fan here.”<br />
“And I’m always happy to meet a future sister,” said 9901, who then briefly noticed the nervousness on Mr. Cully’s face. “Mr. Cully,” she said, “I know you’re worried for your sister, but I promise by the Maker that she will be the same girl you know her as, only better.”<br />
“I appreciate the sentiment miss 01,” Mr. Cully commented before mumbling, “It doesn’t make me feel better though.”<br />
After Millie signed the necessary papers, and Mr. Cully gave his signatures when needed, 9901 led the two visitors across the lobby and into the room where the conversion chamber sat, and 402 was waiting for them. They greeted each other, and 402 and Millie hugged tightly. “I’m so glad you’re doing this,” said 402, “Are you nervous?”<br />
“A little,” Millie replied, “but that won’t stop me. I’m ready.”<br />
“Good,” 9901 said, “When you are able, step into the chamber, and relax.”<br />
Millie let go of her embrace with 402, and took a deep breath. Stepping inside of the chamber, she laid down on the liquid-like ‘beanbag’ and waited as the conversion chamber was sealed shut. It was then that she felt the ‘beanbag’ vibrate below her, rippling and glowing, and causing her clothes to disintegrate, and a sensation in her now naked body that felt amazing. As the ripples continued Millie closed her eyes, and let herself sink into the liquid and breath in the nanites surrounding her. Millie let out a slight moan as the changes quickly became apparent. Parts of her body tingled and her light olive colored skin was, for lack of a better term, peeled away, revealing metal underneath. As the minutes go by, the gynoids and Mr. Cully watched as the body of the woman once known as Millie had its flesh washed away and replaced with the metallic body of a gynoid. At least 20 minutes passed when the vibrations stopped, and the new gynoid was atop the ‘beanbag’ opening her new eyes for the first time. <br />
The chamber opened, and what stepped out was a gynoid whose color schemes were radically different from any converted so far. Her body was a metallic brass color, which can easily be mistaken for gold, and had deep violet accents and eyes. The new gynoid looked at herself and was amazed at how good she felt after her conversion.<br />
“Sister, Welcome!” 9901 said to Millie(?) “As you have desired, you have become a member of the Entertainer Caste. You are now ‘012113-259-027538/Ent’. To be precise, ‘027538’, or ‘538’ for short.”<br />
‘538’: that was her new name. For whatever reason, it fit her perfectly. She smiled as she said, “Thank you, sister.” At that moment, 538 felt what a human would describe as a chill coming up her spine as her world went white, and she immediately heard the voices of millions of her new sisters from across the cosmos welcoming her, including many members of the entertainment caste like herself, as well as the overwhelming tidal wave of love from said sisters. 538 hadn’t felt this much lover since her early human childhood, and she felt the joy of being in a real family again. With all of the love she felt from her sisters, she immediately felt something else: inspiration. New ideas came into her mind for song lyrics, expressing this overwhelming affection, and the vastness of the sisterhood and galaxy, and many more things she had never thought of before. <br />
As the feelings died down, 538 was back in her body, and standing before her manager and sisters. Wiping the green optic fluid off of her cheeks, she walked towards Mr. Cully, who was more than nervous at the approaching gynoid that used to be Millie. Not knowing what to expect, he was caught off guard by the sudden hug 538 gave him. The hug was warm, tight, and felt sincere, just as Mr. Cully remembered Millie doing whenever they finished recording a song. It was then that Mr. Cully realized that this was the same, talented, caring, and gentle woman, that he knew and loved, only with a new body and name. With tears in his eyes he returned the hug. 402 watched with optic fluid in her eyes at the scene before her, noting herself to paint a picture of this later.<br />
“I’m so glad to know you’re still her Mil- I mean 538,” Mr. Cully said.<br />
“I’m happy too,” said 538, “So how does it feel being the manager to Earth’s first gynoid singer.”<br />
“Like I’ll never get used to it,” Mr. Cully admitted, causing 538 and her sisters to laugh.<br />
“Well you better get used to it soon, Mr. Cully,” 538 said, “because inspiration’s struck and we&#39;ll have some new songs to record soon.”</p>
