<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While they were talking, Marcia had gone back down to the first floor and started taking a look around. There were a number of hallways and doorways, and she could hear voices in the distance. But she wasn&#39;t about to go off without Rusty - she trusted him. He might not be psychically sensitive like she was, but he was a grounding influence. Sometimes her psychic abilities could get a bit haywire, particularly when she was exposed to the supernatural. He probably didn&#39;t realize just how much help he was - pulling her back from the brink of possession, or inadvertently helping her strengthen her mental shielding.  But still, she had a bit of a natural curiosity about her, and couldn&#39;t help but explore the house a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you, Ms. Caldwell?&quot; a voice asked. Marcia jumped, startled. A tall young man in his mid-twenties, with dark hair, pale skin, and blue eyes stood before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m David,&quot; he said. He smiled; it was somewhat formal. &quot;I&#39;m one of the junior butlers here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, David. You can call me Marcia. I&#39;m just..trying to get my bearings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me give you the grand tour, then,&quot; he said. His smile seemed a bit more relaxed, but she sensed something else from him. Something was definitely off about him, and her gut told her to stay on her guard. But, she needed to play nice. This was supposed to be a routine paranormal investigation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that, thank you,&quot; she said, returning his smile. She&#39;d rather investigate without him lingering, but clearly that wasn&#39;t going to happen. David&#39;s tour was informative, but a bit too thorough for Marcia&#39;s taste. It was almost as though he was stalling her, and it was becoming annoying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m just going to head back upstairs, actually,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? There&#39;s plenty more to see..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later,&quot; she said. She headed back towards the stairs, feeling David&#39;s eyes on her the whole way. It wasn&#39;t until she was nearly to the stairs that he finally went his own way. <br />
----------<br />
Meanwhile, back in Rusty&#39;s room, Rusty found himself still struggling with Christine&#39;s offer.  &quot;I won&#39;t betray her,&quot; he said quietly. But there was a weakness in his voice. Christine wasn&#39;t foolish; she could read him like a book. He was wanting reassurance. Something that would allow him to feel he was holding to his own moral code. She respected it; loyalty was important. But of course, in this moment, it was a bit of an obstacle.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no betrayal,&quot; she said, her tone reassuring. Her hand brushed his again. A single finger tracing from his forearm down past his wrist. &quot;I can assure you that she&#39;ll be grateful in the end. It&#39;s just a matter of putting her on the path. A little guidance, nothing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty considered her words. They had merit. But there was no denying that there was a nagging suspicion that this wasn&#39;t exactly right. Still..Christine&#39;s gaze was hard to resist. &quot;What do you actually WANT me to do?&quot; Rusty asked. There was a note of frustration mixed with curiosity.  His heart was pounding. He couldn&#39;t tear his gaze from her eyes. Bright blue eyes that both commanded and seduced. Honestly, he wouldn&#39;t turn down a night with Christine either. But he was no fool; if Marcia was out of his league, Christine was out of his universe. She was wealthy and stunning. He was the last sort of person she&#39;d ever go for, beyond a rebellious fling. He didn&#39;t stand a chance. And yet here she was. Offering him everything he&#39;d wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s already exploring the property,&quot; Christine said. A slight half-smile appeared on her lips as she wondered if he realized that Christine had heard the soft footfalls when Marcia had left her room, or now was hearing the muffled conversation downstairs between Marcia and one of the servants. &quot;Though I suspect she&#39;ll be waiting for you.&quot; Again, a knowing half-smile. &quot;All I want you to do is to direct her toward that piece of moon limestone...and have her fully open her mind up to it when she touches it.&quot; Her voice was reassuring. &quot;That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Rusty was confused, and honestly a bit suspicious. He knew she was hiding details. But still, there was a part of his mind that was telling him to just submit. Just let Christine have her way. Just say yes. And in the end, the desire overcame the suspicion. And so he agreed.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; he said. His voice was low, but he was resolute. Christine smiled and moved closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; she said. Her hand stroked his chest. &quot;And Rusty...come see me after she&#39;s done that. I&#39;ll have a...special reward for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A reward?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; Christine purred. &quot;A reward. I am VERY generous to those who are loyal to me.&quot; Her hand pushed him away slightly. &quot;Now go,&quot; she said. Her voice hardened, gaining an air of natural authority. &quot;Your future love is waiting for you.&quot;</p>
