<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The latch clicked into place as Jess slid down the back of the bathroom door. Her breath short and panicked as she placed her head in her hands, not wanting to think about what she had just done, nor wanting to look at the still pulsing appendage now affixed to her body. Behind her she heard footsteps, the soft voice of her mother attempting to coax her out. But her pleas went unanswered. As Jess fought back tears, Joan finally relented. Her voice replaced with the clattering of her hooves that faded back into the night. Soon it was just Jess and her thoughts, alone in silence.<br />
<br />
Above all else one question weighed most heavily on Jess’ mind. <br />
<br />
“What would Henry think?” She slammed a balled fist onto her thigh as her skin jiggled in response. <br />
<br />
“We were just getting along so well!” She forced through gritted teeth. She knew that he had agreed to love her no matter how she changed, but still the thought of rejection haunted her. <br />
<br />
“What if he was just saying that? How could he know how he would feel about me now that… that I have a penis! When he said he loved me I was the only one left who was still all girl… But what about now? How can I tell him?” Her mind desperately searched for a way out of this mess, to avoid the confrontation all together, when suddenly Jess had an idea. <br />
<br />
“Do I have to tell him? After all, it’s not like I waltz around naked... So long as I stay on my best behavior, then I could hide my latest addition...” Finally allowing her male sex to come into focus, she realised that when it wass flaccid, it wasn’t all that large.It appeared to be only human, for now. Jess had to pull her udder out of the way to even glance at it. “Barely noticeable…” She mumbled, trying her best to convince herself. “ Maybe I’ll forget that it’s even there. I do have all this extra jiggle, maybe that will keep me from focusing on it.”<br />
<br />
Jess nodded to herself. Of course it won’t be noticeable. Of course everything was fine! She was making progress with the book she had found, every day she worked she was getting closer to cracking the code and hopefully earning their freedom. She couldn’t let herself get distracted now.<br />
<br />
With renewed determination Jess managed to sit up, lifting her hefty frame from the floor as she stood on two shaky legs. She was immediately greeted with her reflection, staring back at her  from the bathroom mirror. A reminder of just how much she had changed. Her furry ears stood out against her long auburn hair, the longest she had ever seen it. No hairdressers in the Cabin. Nevertheless her eyes gazed further down her body, noticing the small patches of fur that looked to be creeping in from her back. Her fingers traced down her sides, feeling just how big she had gotten recently. Her appetite did her figure no favors as her fingers slipped down her sides, gripping her love handles and belly fat. She watched everything jiggle in place, even her human breasts had swollen to near undesirable sizes. They were bigger than any girl at her school and rivalled even some of her mother&#39;s larger friends, but Jess couldn’t help but smile as she thought of how much her father seemed to like them. How he enjoyed every little change to her body. She remembered the conversation that she had with him, saying that he would love her no matter what changes happened to her. Though she was standing naked in the middle of the night, her core felt warm, her chest tingling as she remembered her father&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
Jess had to shake herself from her memories as she rounded off the last of her changes. Her udder, which now produced milk, sat atop her pelvis, adding more weight to the front of her body. Her tail swished behind her, acting as somewhat of a counter balance, but it wasn’t nearly enough to account for the sheer mass that was her breasts and udder. Jess mulled over how much her body was dragging her forwards, going so far as to wonder what life would be like on all fours. “Got it would almost be easier, not having to sway these things around all day. Four legs would help me balance a lot more.” She muse, before rational thought took over. “God what am I thinking?! I don’t want to be on all fours!”<br />
<br />
Shaking her head Jess pulled herself away from the mirror. She turned and placed her hand on the latch before flicking it back open. She then grasped the door handle, taking one last moment to listen out into the hallway, holding her breath as she tried to see if her mother still roamed the hall. Thankfully there was silence. With a reluctant push Jess finally opened the door, very quietly stepping out into the hallway before staring left and right, finding herself alone. Her mother&#39;s door shut. With a sigh Jess lumbered forward, collecting her discarded clothing on the way back to her bedroom and dressing herself. She felt her new member slide against her panties but she couldn’t see it over her udder. She just had to hope that it wasn’t noticeable. <br />
<br />
Finally she stood at the entrance to her and Henry&#39;s bedroom. The door was still cracked open. Her father still rested inside. Jess swallowed quietly as she ventured inside, guilt wracking her body as she looked upon Henry’s sleeping frame. She knew what the cabin could do, but she couldn’t help but feel like she had cheated somehow. <br />
<br />
Putting her feelings aside she slowly rounded the bed and lumbered up onto the mattress, pulling the blankets back over her. She exhaled. Safe at last. Jess threw her weight around, rolling over onto her side as her body jiggled the bed. Finally back where she belonged Jess prayed for sleep, wanting nothing more than the night to end. But she wouldn’t be so lucky. She heard her father groan before shuffling about himself. He rolled over, draping his arm over her. Jess lost her breath as Henry nudged closer, pulling her into his warm embrace. A gesture that should have reassured her, but now it only brought fear; and a stirring in her loins. Immediately she felt the alien sensation, a tingling warmth in her nethers as her shaft sprung to life, hardening in a moment. It glided against her panties before it’s tip peaked from their lip. Already glistening with a bead of pre. With her fists clenched Jess braced herself for a long night, her mind crying out in frustration. “This was going to be harder than I thought.”</p>
