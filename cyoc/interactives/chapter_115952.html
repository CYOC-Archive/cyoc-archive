<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BREAKING THE LAW!<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Sometimes, scientists intentionally leave &quot;expensive&quot; items laced with the serum around the laboratories based in the more crime-oriented parts of America, just in case someone---BREAKS IN!<br />
<br />
A pair of devious Latino Amigos snuck into the lab, triggering all the red signals and censors like a bull in a china shop. It was a natural thing for them, making a presence in the crime industry.<br />
<br />
They dashed through the halls at lightning speed, brushing through the lasers like they did in their museum heists. Of course, they were unaffected by the noise and bells ringing in their ears, it was just part of the duties of the crime spree for them.<br />
<br />
What they do not realize is that aside from the serum, those lasers contained infrared sensors which genetically alter their genes into expressing &quot;their natural stereotype&quot;. <br />
<br />
They were now carriers of the &quot;genetically modifying serum&quot; in their bodies, lasers recognizing their DNA and heritage and promoted them to being part of their very own &quot;Mexican Cause&quot;, as they greedily snatched every artifact they could stuff in their bags before the doors burst---<br />
<br />
BOOM! The policemen arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH! MARICON! GET THOSE NECKLACES AND LETS JUST GO!&quot; With that being said, they vaulted out of the open window with a loud CRASHHHHHH!<br />
<br />
Speeding through the late afternoon like it was a crime at night. Nothing fazed the two of em, and nothing fazed the scientists watching behind the security camera, as they smiled and watched the new police recruits morph and STRETCH before their very eyes into just another drones of the law.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, the services comes to them<br />
Sometimes, they carry out their own services.<br />
Sometimes, Latino homies carry out their jobs for them.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
It was a quarter past 6:00, a short American Hispanic walked down the same street in his work clothes. Unfortunately, not thriving in the darkening environment despite his name.<br />
<br />
Coyote is not an outgoing guy, unwillingly doing retail in order to pay his bills. His legs, while moderately toughened-are short, had those family genes he absolutely despised.<br />
<br />
He brushed aside the fringes of his 80s styled dark brown hair, pushing up his glasses as he texted to his husband who is doing who knows what? He shrugged, sucked his tout frame up and rolled his eyes to the side.<br />
<br />
Dressed in his work uniform, sneakers and a pair of pants---YEAH! he&#39;s the one who wears the pants, despite being regarded as the feminine one, he maned up in style as he continue down the path home---<br />
<br />
&quot;GASP!&quot; He muffled ravenously, as thick , rough palms pressed tightly against his mouth, breathing in the huge, Mexican, manly scent that went straight to his nostrils.<br />
<br />
Glancing up as he saw a chiseled chin directly above him, prominent features ,a gelled top and olive brown complexion that bested his own. System reacted amorously towards the strong, strange scent.Yet for some reason...it felt familiar?<br />
<br />
Little does he know, every millisecond within close proximity of a carrier of the serum transmits more and more of their pheromones and presence to those of their kind. <br />
<br />
As the pores pressed against his mouth, as they shared body heat, the serum multiplied into its new host. With that being said, it won&#39;t be long till---<br />
<br />
&quot;GOTCHA YA HOMIE!&quot; The chiseled man bellowed, eyes opening as they revealed a sexy dark green. Grinning a tight smirk before it shrunk to a disgusted scowl as he gave the man a ---PUSH!<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU&#39;RE NOT MIGUEL!&quot; He bellowed a deep baritone towards your direction. Eyes widening in shock as his muscular, strong palms brushed against the wall. <br />
<br />
Arms flexing, torso rising as they pressed nicely on his New-Mexico branded, navy blue button-down which barely concealed his tout frame. <br />
<br />
Buttoned only half way, pecs resting comfortably on the top and abs struggling against the remaining bits for some well deserved space.<br />
<br />
&quot;EH FERNANDO! THE COPS BE HEADING...WHAT THE?&quot; Another guy spoke in english....wait? Isn&#39;t it latin? Coyote questioned as his mind was still dizzy from the strong stench of the earlier towering male. <br />
<br />
Both of them wore identical grayish brown pants , stylish but stolen as their feet dotted a pair of polished black leather boots like they were models. <br />
<br />
Tall Latino homies, the only difference was that the other guy had a crimson red exposed button down and hair swept back. Matching goatees, perfect bodies, they were made for the spotlight, spotlight of CRIME!<br />
<br />
&quot;HANDS UP!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them vaulted out of the alley at lightning speed, jumping over the fence in an instant as their ears heard the sound of the siren and coppers yelling. As they dashed away---<br />
<br />
His body moved on his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ayyy Amigos! Wait up!&quot; <br />
<br />
And his mouth too.<br />
<br />
He shouted in slang, as his breathing paced out and feet taking bigger steps as he STRETCHED his legs further and wider than they ever could, eyes widening as he couldn&#39;t control this strong magnetic pull that&#39;s bringing him towards the troublemakers.<br />
<br />
His body felt instinctual as he vaulted over the fence and caught up just a few meters behind his bros, leaving the policemen in dust as the wind blew nicely on his face, and his pouting lips.<br />
<br />
His head hardened out, jaw squaring away those loose ends as they made way for more masculine features to take place up above, and down beLOWWWWWWWW<br />
<br />
SHRRRRRRRRRIP!<br />
<br />
RIPS AND SHRRRREADS echoed past the wind as the threads barely fit his muscular tighs anymore Them growing tighter AND TIGHER! As they raised up to his knees, becoming more like small sized shorts for a big man like him.<br />
<br />
Butt cheeks POPPED OUT WITH STYLE! As their hardasses shimmied away everything, feet BURSTTT open out of his shoes in FRUSTRATION! It&#39;s really impairing his movement as compared to his bros right up front, toes jutting out at the ends. <br />
<br />
He gave a LOUD BELLOW AS he considered on POUNDING HIS CHEST momentarily and ripping apart the shit that&#39;s clinging onto him desperately. <br />
<br />
And if there&#39;s one thing the man does not like, its desperation. He&#39;s always on the run after all, no time for feeling sorry.<br />
<br />
His uniform constricted his chest, pulling apart every unreasonable strand of fabric straining horribly on his bulging biceps as they gave a proud FLEX-BAMPF!<br />
<br />
With a show off, his work-bounded threads EXPLODED into mid air. Revealing a sweating, thumping, moderately hairy chest which was more of a forest, and yet more sustainable than he ever had.<br />
<br />
Matching what transpired above, his dick THROBBED OUT! Of those uncomfortable &quot;shorts&quot; and revealed tannish olive thighs that took over his former skin, filled with caramel-coated veins of Mexico. <br />
<br />
His feet, still at the go, DITCHED away those kid shoes and revealed large brown muscular feet, roughened since young, they barely scratched the surface on the concrete. It was incredible<br />
<br />
His eyes couldn&#39;t stop taking peeks at himself, his larger proportions. It was incredibly sexy, the lining of abs and toughened lady-peckers glistening in sweat and caramel accents.<br />
<br />
His incredible body was for show, as narcissism took hold. Feeling his amazing, self-absorbed cockiness that&#39;s circulating throughout his entire body, testosterone reeking throughout, taking a good whiff of it as his eyes spiraled even further down.<br />
<br />
He smirked, feeling his glorious sex-pack and powerful pecs which bounced to the beat of Espanol, No habla Anglais. Trailing down the treasure trail like a salsa, admiring his hairy legs and reaching for those strangely-captivating, light-orangey boxers of his and---<br />
<br />
&quot;IN IN IN!&quot;<br />
<br />
The loud accented SHOUT snapped him out of the samba. Dashing into the hideout and slamming the door right behind him, heaving a sigh of relief as he got away from the cops and---<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The two latino men stared at him, face momentarily pale due to a part of him remembering that they are---AMIGOS! They are your bros right? Why be afraid?<br />
<br />
His body swaggered towards them on its own, not even worried about his naked bod. He&#39;s A MAN AFTER ALL--No he is...--ONE OF EM!Contradicting thoughts, SHYNESS SINKING LIKE BUTTER, SCREW IT---!<br />
<br />
&quot;WASN&#39;T THAT A GOOD ONE!?&quot; His mouth hollered a loud baritone. Deep, warm, and so sexy that it melted away every tension that stood between them. Just another sexy latino, smirking a wide smile as his brain chilled out as the amigos swung their burly, wrestler-jock like arms over one another and--<br />
<br />
&quot;HAHAGA!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them laughed boisterously, escaping the cops like they always do. They were outlaws after all, the &quot;Mexican Eagles&quot;. America born , and fresh bred from Mexico.<br />
<br />
Him and his bro bros always spoke crude profanities in their language about stuff related to wrestling and crimes and other shit. They bonded like siblings, which was natural in their traditions.<br />
<br />
Mexican homies oughta stick together, be  together and act like one another. Living in these poor conditions was tough but they are the men who thrive in it. <br />
<br />
Crime runs in their blood, latino family heritage is what they prided on. Yet... Coyote still felt something was off...His dark tanned skinned along side some bristles here and there but like...<br />
<br />
He felt something, an extreme urge to---<br />
<br />
&quot;Ayyy BRO! We snagged three hispanic necklaces back at the science shit area.&quot; The brother on the left spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuckin squares stealin what&#39;s rightfully ours!&quot; The other slanged, as he tossed his latino amigo his own share. A matching silver chain with a bull at the front, representing its aggression, strength, fury--POKE!--IN BED!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooo...Buena onda~!&quot;  His smile was cunning, laced with trouble and arrogance and heterosexuality. Feeling waves of phermones oozing out, heating up the room along side his sexy--<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention-Handsome~!&quot; <br />
<br />
He drunkly put on the necklace, not caring the sharp edges and what not. He COULD BARELY FEEL EM! HE WAS A MAN AFTER ALL, NOT SOME GIRLY FAG OR SOME SHIT. HE CAN TAKE IT.<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH RIGHT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AY MARICON! BET YOU I CAN SCORE TRIPLE TONIGHT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE&#39;LL SEE BOUT&#39; THAT!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them swaggered into their separate rooms as per normal, ready to get dressed for the night for some FUCCCKIN! With loud SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! The doors shut.<br />
<br />
The hairy stud stood in front of his full body length mirror, admiring his gorgeous reflection as he pressed his big thumb on the trimmed goatee that spawned below his lower lip.<br />
<br />
He slid on an orange button down, eyes making sure to glance at his devastating muscles and pounding abs as he instinctively buttoned only the bottom row like how his brothers do it.<br />
<br />
He slid on identical looking grayish brownish pants and kicked on those polished boots of the Santiago Gang. It was always their trademark, their style, their unity. Rejoicing in manliness by bouncing their lady peckers cockily in the mirror.<br />
<br />
His eyebrows furrowed and menacing , which always scared the shit out of prissy faggots but deeply attracted those babes that loved the menacing bad boy types.<br />
<br />
His lips were full and as kissable as ever, which was what the ladies loved along side his squarish jaw and thick nose and hypnotising deep breath, hot and heavy, intoxicatingly---<br />
<br />
&quot;AY CARAMBA!&quot;<br />
<br />
He fell backwards onto his messy bed, long dark-brown hair covering his face as he stretched comfortably and homely, like he felt just like at home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snatching a band and tying those thick strands into a top knot, sides shaved off with a quick BUZZ just like what papy used to say. It be shame that the trio had to grew up tough at such a young age, but it was all worth it.<br />
<br />
They had each other&#39;s backs. All of them grew up into incredible studs spawning from their Mexican heritage, different families but related by blood, and related in sexuality.<br />
<br />
He pumped his rising erection with a STRONG FORCE like how he recalled moans and comments that fuelled his ego. If there&#39;s anything that he loved more anything, it was HIMSELF.<br />
<br />
He was cocky, arrogant, and an overall bad influence, but It was what charmed everyone to begin with, his incredible latino features, his tight dominant mexican bod,and being true to himself and his heritage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ay amigo, naked in front of your bros? What are you? Gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Qué Cabrón!&quot;<br />
<br />
Het spoke back, tongue tasted the exotic spices of that spicy sauce of hot latina babes lingering in his mouth. He loved his amigos, they were brothers to him, only brothers. Latina chicks WERE WHAT HE DESIRED, WAS WHAT HIS BODY DESIRED, AND WHAT HIS BODY WANTS-HIS BODY GETS!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s what made him---<br />
<br />
PSSSSSSSSH!<br />
ZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!<br />
SLAM!<br />
<br />
&quot;CARLOS SANTIAGO!&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes shot a sparking mutant green as he slammed open the door, breaking it for the third time this week. He cannot help it, he is just too aggressive, too boisterous and too HOT to be contained!<br />
<br />
His straight manlihood throbbed for more, needing to head out with his bros to satisfy his cravings. No homo, ALL HETERO. He was a horny heterosexual male, Latino stereotype, MORE LIKE LATINO SEXY TYPE.<br />
<br />
Carlos Santiago smirked as he and his bros swaggered out into the Mexican neighborhood. Ready to cause trouble with his amigos and charm some Latino Chicas like he always does.</p>
