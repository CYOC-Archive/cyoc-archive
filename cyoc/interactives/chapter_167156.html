<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harmony looked at the now three merpeople who were once her human friends or friends of friends. She then looked at the mermaid Cura and began to think about the offer presented to her for what had to be the hundredth time. She was being given the chance to run or rather swim away from her life on land, to go live in the sea but was that better or was it worse. On land she was a nurse she was helping people and doing what she loved. However she lived in a tiny ass apartment because of her student loans and everything seamed to look down on her or worse play grab ass with her. <br />
It wasn’t that she wasn’t a beautiful women she was, she had long blonde hair, deep blue eyes and was tall and skinny and she had a rack and ass the most women would die for. That was the problem, some of the people she treated thought because she looked like a bimbo trophy wife that they could treat her like one to. She had slapped so many hands from her ass while at work or caught so many older men looking at her rack that it was annoying. The doctors where only a little better and that was because they did not want to get fired. All the boyfriends she had treated her like an idiot as well and some where amazed that she did not sleep with them on the first night. Her overbearing mother pushing her to have a kid with one of those rich doctors was not helping either, to her mother she was just a baby making machine to give her grandkids. <br />
She wanted kids, she had known that since she was little girl but she also wanted to be a nurse or better yet a doctor. Her family was more traditional, a women’s place was at home with the kids. They had even bullied her oldest sister to give up teaching when her niece was born. Looking back she could see that to them only certain professions where accepted for a women, teacher, nurse and the like and once she was married with kids she was expected to give that up and be a stay at home mom. She would also be expected to pop out as many kids as possible, she was the 4th of nine children and her mother and father each had 8 or more brothers or sisters. She had more cousins then she could even keep track of, she wanted kids but not to be a baby factory but that is what women where expected to be in her family.<br />
She was about to ask a question when Colton swam up to Cura.<br />
“Fuck it…lets do this.” Said Colton as Cura looked at him. <br />
“You sure?” inquired Cura “You will not be able to go home.”<br />
“Damon is like a brother to me, he is family and besides I do love the sea.” Said Colton with a stupid grin. “Besides it is either this or go back to a dead-end job, might as well explore the seas.”<br />
“Very well.” Said Cura “Do you want to randomize your tail or go with your suit?”<br />
Colton looked at his orange with black flames swim trunks and tried to image it as a tail, taking a close look at Lupa’s golden tail with the red imprint of the Aztec dragon now on her side and back. <br />
“Ya…lets keep the suit.” Said Colton as Cura nodded her head and swam forward pulling out an orb and placing it against Colton’s chest. She broke the orb and swam away for a moment nothing happened as Colton just looked on as this suit began to extend. To his slight confusion the black flames which danced around the bottom of his orange suit disappeared as the orange suit extended. No scales seamed to form as the orange suit extended down and down past his feet. It still looked like his suit material and then just as the fins began to appear the suit hardened and began to turn into scales. It was mostly a bright orange but with some darker and lighter orange. Around the bottom of his new tail including the fines where black scales which looked like fames. <br />
“Cool.” Said Colton <br />
“You should see your behind.” Said Cura as she waved her hand as the water behind Colton seamed to harden a bit into something a kin to a mirror. The back side of Colton’s tail was almost totally black with the flame licks running down both sides. <br />
“Amazing.” Said Colton<br />
“And lastly.” Said Cura as she looked at Harmony<br />
“Question.” Said Harmony. “Do you or should I say your society expected people to have kids or mermaids to be stay at home moms.”<br />
Behind Cura her friends where looking at her a little confused by the question.  <br />
“Well if you want to be a stay at home mom that is certain your choice, Ana informed us that you where a nurse. Your help would be most welcomed with our sick and wounded.” Stated Cura “I will add…there is a push by the government to increase births so all couples are expected but not forced to have at least two kids. Your human pollution has done a number on some of our populations but it is not forced on anyone.”<br />
“I see.” Said Harmony<br />
“I will add as well, we accept couples of all sexual orientation as well.” explained Cura as she looked at Stacy. “You and Chloe will be welcomed and actually not that uncommon.”<br />
“Wow…mersociety is more progress then human society.” Laughed Stacy with a smile on her face. “I am liking this better by the moment.”<br />
“Screw it…make me a mermaid.” Said Harmony as she swam forward a bit. She just nodded still not fully convinced when Cura asked if she wanted to have a random transformation instead she just went with her light blue suit. Harmony’s heart was racing as Cura placed the orb over her chest and broke it.<br />
It felt so strange, the energy wave pulsing into her body changing it into a new form. The first outward change was the opening of gills along her side. Like the others the gills had a few scales around it but to her slight confusion along with the sky-blue scales there where hot pink scales. She looked down at her suit and noticed that while the bulk of the bikini was sky blue the strings holding everything together was hot pink. <br />
She watched as her top transformed into blue shells with pink cord holding everything together. It was strange she expected a seashell top to not provide a lot of support but it felt very good as the first scales began to form on her legs. It was mostly sky blue with a few spots of royal blue in as well however with a large mix of hot pink mixed in. Her tail fins where totally hot pink with a little bit of blue mixed in on the edges in the end she smiled as she looked at her new body.<br />
“Well 3 more beautiful mermaids and 2 handsome merman to join our village and our world.” Said Cura with a smile “Welcome all of you to our society, now follow me and we will get you to your friends. It’s a about a half hour swim.”</p>
