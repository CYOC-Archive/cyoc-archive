<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Ty and his rag tag guild set off to the city. They managed to piece together two working wagons that were locked inside a large wooden shed behind the witch’s hut. They loaded the first with water and food rations, along with other necessary supplies and equipment. The second they carefully loaded with the potions, ingredients, and other loot gathered from their exploration of the dungeon. They also carefully managed to store the living statue as well, it had quickly became their war trophy and they wanted to make sure the witch suffered. However, there was no room to transport passengers aside from a driver and one other in the front. So the three dozen or so players would have to walk along side their wagons as the made their way eastward along the dirt road. <br />
<br />
Early that morning Ty, Jackie, and a few others had returned to the goblin camp. There they snagged any loot they could, but their main goal was to get the herd of cows  that Ty had previously transformed. Thought not the best suited to haul their wagons they would have to do, besides they should be able to fetch some coin if taken to market or perhaps to be used by the guild in other ways. They were not sure how long they would be trapped in this realm and having a stable source of coin would go a long way in providing the financial resources needed to fund better weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
It was close to mid day by the time everyone got moving. It would take a few days longer with the cattle but the payoff they hoped would be as worth it. It gave everyone more time to really let the events of the past few days sink in and many wanted to prepare for whatever lay ahead of them, after all none among them had gotten to play this game for very long so there were a great many unknowns out there. <br />
<br />
Kelly the Necromancer was one of the few lucky enough to get a seat on one of the wagons and she used her time studying the mysterious book she had uncovered. She tried to open it several times but to no avail whatever sealed this book away was of an ancient and powerful magic. Once they made it to the city hopefully she could take it to someone who might know more about it and how to open it. She muddled around with the words the book had whispered to her. Break Game, what exact was the meaning she wondered. Perhaps this book was dangerous or perhaps it was the key to escaping this world; wherever, the case she needed to know more before bringing this to the others. This could be a very dangerous tool and for now the less people who know of it the better, but when the time comes she will let the right people know about it. The frog-elf girl seemed to know what she is doing and if there was anyone who she had to confide in it would be her. <br />
<br />
The hours passed without event and eventually they set up camp for the night. Ty helped Aaron down from the wagon and they set up their tents. <br />
<br />
“I’m so glad I didn’t have to walk all day heaving these udders.” Aaron stated to Ty, with a hint of drowsiness in her voice. “I don’t think I would have even made it a mile. Thanks Ty for helping me.”<br />
<br />
“No problem. You would do the same if our positions were reversed.” Ty yawned fighting to keep awake. And once their tents were up Ty and Aaron quickly fell asleep they would need all the rest they could get, it would be another long day tomorrow.<br />
<br />
A few select few players had been chosen to keep watch while the rest settled down for the night. Unbeknownst to them, they were being watched. For quite some time a group of bandits had been following the guild and waited for the perfect time to strike. With out warning the bandits attacked the sleeping players and all hell broke lose. The few guards were quickly overwhelmed and pushed back the the center of camp. Several players were taken in their sleep, hauled off by the bandits into the dark woods presumably to their camp.<br />
<br />
Ty and Aaron were quick to awake. Stepping out of their tents they saw the chaos unfold around them. Several players were captured with nets and snares, dragged kicking and screaming off into the night. A small group of players had regrouped and were pushing the bandits back. Chiefly, the wizards and warlocks with several warriors and Paladins had formed a defensive ring around the wagons, blasting and slashing all who dared come too close. Ty fearing the worst was forced to make a quick decision. <br />
<br />
“Aaron! Grab Steph we need to get you two back in the fight now! I still have a few vials that might help you.” Ty shouted, over the noise of battle. Ty figured it was risky but they were in serious trouble. Aaron quick when back into her tent and retrieved Steph from her bag. She waddled over to Ty as fast as her dainty legs would take her. Once together Ty grabbed the remaining goblin potions and gave the strength potion to Aaron. “Let’s hope this works!” Ty exclaimed, as Aaron quickly popped the cork and chugged the whole potion. There was a brief pause and then a slight warm sensation in her gut and then nothing. <br />
<br />
“Well?” Ty asked, looking his friend up and down for any signs of change.<br />
<br />
“I don’t feel any different. Maybe it was a dud.” Aaron exclaimed, and after waiting for what seemed like an eternity they decided that the potion did not work. What Aaron did not realize was that the potion did in fact work, it just have her a different kind of strength. Aaron now had extreme sexual stamina.<br />
<br />
After not seeing any changes in Aaron, Ty quickly force feed Steph the horse potion and crossed his fingers. It didn’t take long for the potion to take effect. Steph started to morph and twist, growing larger and larger. A humanoid shape took form and before their eyes Steph was restored to her old orc self with the exception of much larger tits and ass and completely naked. Steph cupped her enlarged breasts and gave them a playful squeeze. <br />
<br />
“I’m back!” Steph shouted, excited to finally be free. But her excitement didn’t last long as she felt another change coming on. Suddenly, a massive horse cock burst from her groin. It was fat and long, reaching past her knees. She reached down with both hands and was surprised to find that not only did she have a massive horse cock and balls but also her old pussy as well. A burning desire quickly took over her; as her pussy leaked a constant flow of cum and her cock hardened, and grew erect nestling between her large tits. Lost to the growing lust, Steph grabbed both her tits and quickly rubbed her new member, giving herself a tit job before exploding in a massive orgasm sending a massive load of cum all over her fat tits and face while simultaneously a massive torrent of cum burst from her pussy drenching her bare legs and feet. Nymphomania it seems was an additional side effect of her spending a day as a living sex toy, but there were more pressing matters that helped clear her thoughts.<br />
<br />
 “Well it looks like the horse potion made you hung like a horse” Ty exclaimed. “At least you got your body back. Now grab a weapon and let’s help the others. Aaron stay here and try not to get captured”<br />
<br />
Ty and Steph stepped outside the tent, but before they could join the others Ty was hit on the head and fell to the ground. Steph managed to take out a few bandits before she took was knocked out. The last thing Ty saw before slipping into unconscious was one of the wagons bursting into flame. The bandits tied up Ty and Steph and dragged them off into the woods. Apparently satisfied with their haul the bandits broke off their attack. Ten players were taken prisoner, and about a dozen were injured. Luckily no one was killed except several bandits. However it would take time for the guild to regroup. A rescue attempt would not happen tonight, the remaining players would need to fortify their camp, tend to the wounded, and when dawn’s first light would appear make plans to rescue those that were taken.</p>
