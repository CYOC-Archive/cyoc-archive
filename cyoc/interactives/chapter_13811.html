<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hello!” A frail female voice called from the front of the store. “Oh dear, HELLO!!!”<br />
The Barber walked out form his back room to find an elderly woman desperately trying to get a wheelchair bound man through the front door of the shop.  It had started raining out and they were both drenched.<br />
“Here, let me help” He said taking over for the woman.  She stood aside, as the Barber was able to pulled the man over the threshold and into the shop.<br />
“I’m sorry, it’s an old building and we’re not obligated to upgrade to the new handicapped laws.”<br />
‘I’m not handicapped, I’m just old.” The man muttered from the chair.<br />
“And wet.” The old woman said tying to make a joke out of the situation.<br />
“We’ve been waiting 45 minutes for a cab that was suppose to be there in 10. The doctor’s office we were at has closed for the day in the meantime, and then it started raining.  What a day…” only at the end of her explanation did the woman’s voice show her true feeling.  A sorrow and tiredness.  While they were out of the rain, and they might be able to get a cab later, it was still a long trip home and she was already beyond her limit.<br />
“You are both certainly welcomed to wait here till it stops.  And you are both soaked.  Hmmm.  Ma’am I think you should get out of those wet clothes.”<br />
“Yes, but into what.”<br />
“Well I’ve got some sheets that I use to cover people when I cut their hair. It’s kind of a reverse robe but you could both cover yourselves with them till the dryer I have for the towels takes care of your clothes.”<br />
‘We can’t impose.”<br />
“It’s raining like Noah needs to start counting out animals two by two again.  No one’s coming in the shop till it’s done.”<br />
“Well, if you don’t mind.  It’s not for me but I’m so worried about Jon.”<br />
It took a few minutes but first the older woman changed in the back room, then they lifted the man out of his chair and into one of the barber seats.<br />
She was remarkably quick at undressing the old man down to his underwear given his weight and inability to move.  His fingers were curved from arthritis.  His knees and ankles had swollen with fluid from non-use.  <br />
While he seemed a bit embarrassed by all the attention she was giving him…there…the Barber saw it.  He gave her a look of such love.  Of such pain.  Of knowing what he was doing to her and not being able to help. Of knowing she wouldn’t have it any other way.  Of knowing how at night, she would pray for the pain to end, but for them never to be apart.<br />
“You sit in this other chair Ma’am.  I’ll take your clothes to get dry.”<br />
The Barber held her hand as she got up in the Barber chair.  A few towels under her head made for a nice pillow.  She was thin, skin like onion paper. When he took her hand he could only feel skin and bones, literally.  <br />
Though the back of the cloth he could see a bit of a hump had developed, but she carried herself in a way so it wasn’t as noticeable unless you were looking for it.  Or she was too tired to try to hide it any more. By the time he got back from placing their cloths in the dryer, she had fallen asleep.  The old man made brief eye contact with the Barber then looked away.<br />
“Are you warm enough sir?  There’s some fairly bad coffee if you’d like...”<br />
“I’m fine, I’m fine.  She’s alright isn’t she?”<br />
“I think she’s just fallen asleep.  Not the first person to do that in one of these chairs.”  The barber said as he whipped down the old man’s wheelchair from all the rainwater that still puddled in the seat.  “Sir you look like you could use a shave.  I happen to be in that business. Could I interest you in one?”<br />
He looked at the old woman again, then the Barber, then the floor.<br />
“Do you mean just a shave?”<br />
“… I’m sorry?”<br />
“You’re him aren’t you?”<br />
The Barber took a long pause before answering.  He took his time to sum up what he was seeing, what he had been asked and where this was going.  “‘Him’ sir?”<br />
“Come on COMEON!!” The old man yelled then looked to his wife to make sure she didn’t wake up.  “People talk, there a rumors, tales.  For YEARS it’s been legend.  But you just can’t always walk into this place.  I’ve been trying to find this shop for years.  That’s why we come all the way down here to that stupid doctor who don't know shit.  And today, in the rain, this was suddenly the only doorway we could find.  Please tell me, you’re him.”<br />
“I’m a barber sir.  It’s always been my job to make people feel better about how they look.  That’s a Barber’s job.”<br />
“Please, please please…… don’t make me beg.  I know what you can do, I know what the price is, and I know what I’m asking.”<br />
“What are you asking?”<br />
“STOP IT!!!”  The old man yelled again. “I know you can do things, change people.  I know what they become.  I know what I’m doing, I know what <br />
I’m asking and I’m asking for your help.”<br />
“Let’s say I know what you’re talking about, I can do the things you’ve heard.  There are certain limits I have to stick to, certain things…”<br />
“I’M HOT FOR COCK, I’M HOT FOR COCK!!! Is that what you want to hear?  Is that what you want me to say!!!” tears started coming to his eyes. “Turn us gay, turn us flaming.  I just…. I just can’t be apart from her.  I can’t leave without her and I can’t leave her alone.  And we can’t go on like this. There’s no other hope of being free from this pain but death.”<br />
“Do you speak for your wife too, are you prepared for the change that might happen to her and where it would take your relationship?”<br />
“We’re in our late 80’s, my dick ain’t worked since the 70’s and her tits are like dried up fruit. Physically neither of us are the person we married, but I love her as much today as the day I met her.  And if age, sickness and pain don’t matter, what else could make a difference? I love her still, I’d love her no matter what.  I’d love her even after death and find her again in the next life no matter what”<br />
“I see.  Jon you’re very tired.  Why not lay back in the chair yourself.”<br />
“Yes I am tired.” the old man said laying back and closing his eyes.  <br />
“I’ll start with your wife.  Considering how many years I’ve done this, I haven’t had much practice with this next trick.”<br />
The Barber walked over to the woman and lightly took a hand full of hair.  It was dry but soft, almost like cotton candy.  Slowly he pulled the handful of hair up and instead of the hair stopping at the root, or being pulled away completely, the hair continued to grow out. Her hair was now thinker and she looked about 15 years younger.  <br />
“I saw that work on a Barbie once, didn’t know it would work on people.”<br />
He pulled again, getting a better hand full of hair now that it was coming in thicker.  The hair that came out started to shade darker, and she looked to be in her mid 40’s.  <br />
“All most there” <br />
Two more pulls and she had a thick head of hair, dark brown and appears in her early 20’s.  She had remained asleep throughout all of this. <br />
“I think I can work with this.  Not going to need all this length though, most but not all. And not even my sinks could handle all this hair.”<br />
Taking his clippers he cut the hair far past the grey line but leaving it still half way from the head to the floor.<br />
“Looks about right.  Let’s lean you back and give you a wash.” After wetting the hair and rubbing in some shampoo the Barber picked up a bottle of black liquid. “You’ve got dark hair again, but I think we can go a bit darker.  It’s one of those cheap shampoo-in hair treatments, but it’ll do what needs to be done.” He squirted a bit of the hair dye out of the bottle and into the sink, where it combined with the water and hair.  As the hair absorbed in the dark liquid the woman began to get darker herself.  Her pale skin tone took on a more brown honey complexion.  Lips a bit fuller and a bit wider.  Even her nose got a bit larger, but not unattractive.  Eye brows heavier sitting on a thicker brow and cheekbones more pronounced.  By the time the Barber returned her to a sitting position, she was an 18 Hispanic version of her former self. <br />
Taking his best comb the Barber split portioned off a large section of the incredibly long hang and combed it forward over the woman’s face.  The hair was still wet and this added to the already considerable weight of the hair.  After saving off the amount of hair he would later need, the Barber clipped it off to keep in out of the way. <br />
Taking out his larger hair clipped, the Barber turned them on and went to work.  Except for the saved off hair in front, the Barber started shaving the hair down to barely a shadow.  And with each stroke of the electric clippers the woman became more and more male.  Her small pair of breast shank in and spread out into his modest pair of pecs. While the circumference of the nipples didn’t shrink that much, they now sat flat against the chest, continuing to turn dark mocha to match the new heritage.   Shoulders became wider, ass a bit firmer but retained a bit of a booty-esque tone.  Arms stronger, hands bigger, even a little bigger for the body.  The feet did the same as they were now found at the end of longer, leaner legs.  Finally the cock started to form, with the balls first dropping out of the virgina and the dick itself pushing out.  Foreskin attached to the end and all.  Almost snake like it emerged until the former female sex organ was gone, replaced with a long, dark brown dick and a hairy set of low hanging balls.   <br />
“So far so good” <br />
Taking the long strands of hair that hung like impossible bangs off the front of the Latino youths forehead.  He because to braid them into for incredibly long stands that would hang off the front of the front of his forehead.  And as the hair started to be knotted, so did the boy’s muscles.  Arms started getting larger, back spread out and legs hard like mini tree trunks.  Not bodybuilder levels but throw a pair of shorts over them and if traffic didn’t stop, it would cause a crash when they got a look at the ass.  Up form the newly formed dick a 6 then 8 pack starts to pop.  The pecs swell up and hang off the chest, the large nipples now pointing down a bit.  A day’s growth of beard formed on the face with squared off. He’d grown to 5’8” with a waist that was barely bigger than when he was a little old woman, but now with shoulder so wide they would have trouble getting though a doorway. <br />
	The last part of the braiding continued and so did the changes.  In the middle of the now solid chest appears a tattoo of a 4 sided star. Not unlike the milled of a compass.  In a semi circle around his left nipple 5 smaller stars appeared.  On his back a large detailed sun tattoo appeared, reaching back and forth from each shoulder and from the nape of his neck to just above his ass.  As a final touch, on his arms appears silver bracelet after bracelet.  The left eye brow now sported several hoops and each ear was slightly weighed down by large silver hoop earrings.<br />
	The barber stepped back and took in the Goth Latino youth in his chair.  18 year old stud with a major body with major body enhancements. <br />
	“I should do women more often.  So to speak.” The Barber said moving over to the husband. It was an odd couple now in his chairs.  Punk stud in one chair and old man in the other.  Both still fast asleep. <br />
	“But Jon old man, got a secret for you.  That took a lot out of me.  So, we’re going to have to go the easy route and go with the classics.” The Barber whispered in the old man’s ear.  Carefully he pulled the chair into a reclined position, lowering it slightly with the foot pedal at the same time. The Barber reached forward and grabbed as much hair as he could from the front of the old man’s head.  With one strong shove the Barber propelled the old man out of the chair, ripping off his entire head of hair at the same time.  But it wasn’t the old man who landed on his feet facing the mirror across from his, dazed and more than a little confused.<br />
	Trying to steady himself was a 6’6” mountain of muscle.  If the man in the other chair would have trouble getting his shoulders though a door way, this man would tear the doorway out of the frame just going through.  A perfectly trimmed goatee and his eyebrows were the only hair to be found on his body.  The head was perfectly smooth, not even a trace of shadow.  The back massive in a perfect V formation down to an ass that looked like two bowling balls had been shoved under his skin.  And as thin as the waist was, the leg ballooned the body out again.  Arms bigger than most people’s legs.  Every muscle defined and perfectly cut, like he was made of marble. Age wise he couldn’t have been older the 19 but his eyes, sparkling blue eye told of an old soul. In front the pecs must enter rooms a few minutes before the rest of him would.  Solid slabs, square, skin stretched so tight across them that it almost looked like it would tear.  A ring hung from the left nipple but it was like a needle in a haystack.  The cock was not insanely large by proportion on the man it was attached to, but given the proportions of that man, it would have dwarfed any other within a 4 block area. It was cut, with a single ring that matched the ring though his nipple hanging off the side of the growing head.<br />
	“HEY!!!” The man bellowed, waking up the other sleeping beauty. <br />
	“Sir, are you alright?” the Barber asked.<br />
	“What the fuck!?!?!”<br />
	“Why are you standing naked in the middle of the room screaming?” the Latino youth asked getting up.  He pulled off the sheet covering his to show that he too was naked.<br />
	“Cause….. I don’t know why I’m naked…. And in this room…. Wait... Is it raining?”  The big man said turning around and looking out the window at the torrents of water that continued to come down. “Oh yea….”<br />
	“Oh my, you gentlemen must have been tired.  How disorienting.  But I suppose it’s not every day you wake up naked in an old fashioned barber shop now is it?”<br />
	“Got that right.” <br />
	“Oh wait, Jonny remember?  We were looking for that apartment but got caught in the rain. God, it seems like so long ago. Did we fall asleep while you were drying out clothes?”<br />
	“Right I shaved your head, as I was braiding you hair.”<br />
	“Did you… OH YEA look at that!!  Awesome man!!  What do you think Jonny?”<br />
	“You always look good babe.” The muscleman said crossing the room, taking his lover in his arms.  He literally had to bend his face down to kiss his partner on the top of the skull. “Oh, sandpaper.  You should go for the tweeze.  I’m smooth and silky for another two months.” He said running one of his massive hands over his bald scalp and the other over his lover’s shaved head.<br />
	“I’ll see if you’re cloths are dry yet.” The Barber said walking into the back room.<br />
	“I must have had a bad dream.” Jonny said getting in the chair.  <br />
“My hands were and you….. there was so much pain and death.  Someone… something was going to take you away from me and there was nothing I could do about it. Tears started forming in the eyes of the large man. <br />
	“What the… hey come on” He held Jonny’s head against his chest and began to slowly rock it. “Just a dream, big guy.” He held the head up and their mouths joined for a passionate kiss. “Umm, you think he’ll be gone long” Paco asked stepping back showing his prick was solid.<br />
	“We... shouldn’t, he’s been so nice and HURRY UP MAN!!!” Jon said throwing his legs in the air.  His hairless asshole now ready for his lover to enter. “He’s going to be back in a minute,”<br />
	Paco grabbed his uncut cock and slowly entered the bodybuilder’s ass.  Jon bit is lip and winched a bit but the smile never left his face.  Paco steadied himself by holding onto Jon’s legs.  He pulled back for a second and then entered again. “Been a while since we’ve done like this.”<br />
	“Have we ever done it like this before?” <br />
	“No talking, more kissing”<br />
	With great care Paco continued to slowing mount his lover’s ass.  The aroma was charging them both and the continual deep mouth kisses didn’t slow them down any either.  Jon suddenly looked around and grabbed a small towel off the chair next to them, threw it over his own gigantic engorged cock and he shot his wad. <br />
	“Mind if I join you.” Paco said as he leaned in and unloaded himself into Jon’s ass.<br />
	“As always my dear, you’re still the best.” Jon said as Paco pulled out.<br />
	“As always my dear, you’re an easy lay.” They laughed a bit at this but stopped once they heard the Barber coming back. “Toss that in your bag” Jon said throwing Paco the gooey cum filled cloth. “We’ll wash it and bring it back some day.”<br />
	“Gentlemen your clothes are dry but I’m afraid the leather pieces are still a bit.” He held a leather arm strap up to his nose, “umm, a bit rank.”<br />
	“No” Paco said taking his black jeans from the Barber “His always smell like that.”<br />
	“Goth boy here has a thing about me wearing leather so he’s always on my case about it.” Jon said beginning to snap the four leather straps on each arm. “Although – sniff – you maybe right about the rain.”<br />
	The two men dressed in the clothes they walked in with, but of course had never worn before in their lives.  Paco taking time to help Jonny with his shoes since the giant of a muscle man had trouble bending down and tying the laces.  And where they found Dr. Martins in his size was a trick even only the Barber could have pulled off.  The denim shorts he worm appeared to be nothing more than a Speedo made in blue jean material.  A cut off shirt the ended just above his nipples completed the bodybuilder’s outfit.<br />
	Paco was dressed all in black, with a sleeveless t-shirt ripped at the neck down low enough not to hide the chest tattoo.  A silver cross was taken out of the pocket, kissed first and placed around his neck.<br />
	“Again sir, we can’t possibly thank you enough for all your help today.” Jonny said shaking the Barber’s hand. “We’re looking to move to this area so we won’t use anywhere else for hair cuts.  Well he won’t “Jonny said rubbing his smooth head again. “You ready?”<br />
	“Almost” Paco said from his place in front of the mirror.  To finish off the Goth look he has already applied black eye shadow and was putting on some black lipstick.  I worked perfectly on the Latino stud, giving an air of mystery and sensuality lost from most into that scene.  <br />
	“Come on, man.  Can you believe it?” Jonny said turning to the Barber, “Someone like me falling in love with someone who wore eye shadow and lip stick?”<br />
	“Love always finds a way.”<br />
	Unnoticed by the two men, it has stopped raining.  The clouds were still overhead but nothing was in their way as the left the store.  The Barber though it was charming how the giant of a bodybuilder and the gothic Latino stud has no qualms holding hands as they walked up the street.</p>
