<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the movie, you, Katherine, and Jennifer, got the distinct felling that you were being watched. Through out all of the first movie, you were on high alert. Then half way through the second movie, Jared fell asleep. It put you and your friends in a slightly more comfortable position; it was, after all, a very boring movie. But just as the tension wore off, someone behind you whispered, &quot;So they did it to you to. I hope for your sake that you adapt to different situations easily.&quot; That sent you over the edge. You sprang up and rushed out of the theater, not bothering to look and see who said it, because the last bit sounded very much like a threat. When you finally stopped, it was out side of a Marble Slab Creamery. When your friends caught up, what the stranger had said was still echoing in your mind. &quot;How about we get some ice cream?&quot; you said, hoping that it would help take your mind off of the mysterious stranger and what they said. &quot;I&#39;m down with that. Who&#39;s paying?&quot; Katherine said. Rembering that you had brought your wallet, you said &quot;It&#39;s on me.&quot; After they had gotten their ice cream, they went to one of the tables in the corner to talk and enjoy their ice cream in peace. Out of the corner of your eye, you saw a teenage girl order some ice cream, which was normal, since it&#39;s an ice cream shop, but something about her was different. She looked about five foot four, maybe C cup breasts, light brown hair went down to her lower back, and she wore slightly faded jeans, a baseball cap, convers, a grafic T-shirt, and a jacket. Wait a second, you thought, who wears a jacket in the beginning of summer? After receiving her order, she came and sat down at the same table as you. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind me siting here. I just want to talk. And no, I don&#39;t work for those psychopaths that did this to you.&quot; She said, her voice sounding strangely bitter while saying the last sentence, but kind and sweet for the first two. Both Jennifer and Katherine were to stunned to speak, so you said the first question that popped into your head, but slightly changed it in case she was a crazy person who had no idea of what she was talking about, &quot;Who are you, and what are talking about?&quot; <br />
&quot;To answer your second question first, you might want to hide the ears and tail to blend in a little better. And as for your first question, I&#39;m Johanna Michelle Evans. But most people call me Joie.&quot;<br />
&quot;What makes you think that we&#39;re not wearing costumes?&quot; Katherine said, recovering from the fact that some random person had just sat down and spoke to them as if they had known them. In response, Joie took off her baseball cap, and under neath were two cat ears, up and alert to every sound. You and your friends gasped, as Joie went on to say &quot;The same thing that they did to you happened to me, before the &quot;experiment,&quot; my name was Jonathan Michael Evans, and now I&#39;m a cat-girl. And if I ever run into one of those son of b*ches, I&#39;ll give them two options. One, that there subjected to the same thing that happened to us, or, since they work for the goverment, handing them over to terrorists to be tortured for information.&quot;<br />
&quot;Woah, that&#39;s harsh.&quot; you said.<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry, it&#39;s just they did a lot more than make me into a cat-girl.&quot;<br />
&quot;What else did they do?&quot; Jennifer asked, suddenly very afraid of Joie.<br />
&quot;Wait, of their going to change us back to normal at the end of the year, why do you want to do such horrible things to the people who will fix us? I mean, I want to be a guy again as soon as possible, but why do that to the only people with the cure?&quot; you asked. She stared at you for a moment, and then, she laughed a laugh that was cruel and harsh, but could still be described as cute and feminine. &quot;You really believe that, don&#39;t you? Would you still think that if they murdered your parents because they wouldn&#39;t allow them to subject you to the experiment, or that they would teach you everything you need to know to grow up as a woman if it was just going to last a year, just because your a girl!? What there teaching you, is ment to be used every day of the rest of your life.&quot; Her voice was bitter, and full of hatred and sorrow, with tears in her eyes. A sudden fear crept into your mind, and you had to a question. &quot;How long have you been like this?&quot; you asked your voice quavering.<br />
&quot;Three years. Three long, miserable years of being an orphan, knowing that my brother and sister, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter which way I say it, are off in some secure military facility where they put everyone after they kill the parents that agreed to the one year. I was lucky to have not been shipped off their my self.&quot; You and your friends were stunned. With all that had happened to Joie, it was a miracle that she could do any thing.<br />
&quot;So, basically, we only have a month to return back to normal before all hope is lost.&quot; Jennifer said.<br />
&quot;Unless you can escape them without dying, yes.&quot; They ate their ice cream in silence, contemplating how they would fix themselves with in the month.<br />
&quot;How have you survived all this time on your own? And how old are you?&quot; you ask, breaking the tense.<br />
&quot; I&#39;m seventeen, and the cat skills have been very handy in my survival. And I also have a job. The tail is a little hard to hide, but I have to wear a hat so it&#39;s easier to hide the ears.&quot; Katherine asked &quot;Where do you live?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been able to rent a apartment. It&#39;s not very fancy, but it&#39;s not one of those sh*ty ones that a person would be forced to live in; like in that movie that you watched.&quot;<br />
&quot;You watched it too.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I was actually thinking of how to get you three out of the theater.&quot;<br />
After every one had finished there ice cream, they wandered around the mall until you said &quot;So, what are we going to do now?</p>
