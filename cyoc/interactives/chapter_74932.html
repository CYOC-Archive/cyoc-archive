<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Josh squeezed and rubbed his dirty dress in the detergent water for a brief moment, to his later surprise, he forgot about his predicament. Focusing on the job, he managed to empty his mind. Somehow performing the chore acted like a relaxing drug on the body he inhabited now. It was when he tried to whistle when it all came back to him. No whistle would escape his mouth; he could clearly feel that his lips were simply too puffy to form the right shape. He stuck his tongue out again and looked at it cross-eyed. It somehow felt easier on his eyes this time. Did it grow?<br />
<br />
Finally muscles in his delicate girly arms felt sore and he had to stop the washing. The OCD need of doing the laundry was satisfied and he stood up, tried to squeeze as much water out of the dress as possible and hung it on the drying rack. He stood with his hand on his hips looking at his work. And then it hit him again. <br />
<br />
He felt his sides where his hands touched his waist. There was a clear flare as his waist proceeded into already visibly wider hips. And then he realized that none of the annoying feelings in his body were gone. His nipples still ached dully and he could feel something like pressure in his pelvic bone, being slowly released, but then increasing again. On top of that he felt his little tummy demanding some food. <br />
<br />
Josh left the bathroom and proceeded to go to the staircase. As he made his first step there, he clearly miscalculated the depth of the first stair. Josh was used to stairs reaching at most a little above his ankle. This body's, Lizzy's, height made them reach past her mid-calf. Josh lost his balance and before he could grab a hold of the rail, he tumbled down the staircase. <br />
<br />
Josh's new mother heard the noise and quickly went to see what happened only to witness her adopted daughter laying down on the floor by the stairs.<br />
<br />
Luckily to Josh, apart form a little pain on his elbow he was fine. He was fine physically. Inside he was getting really fed up with dealing with his new height, with having to wear dresses, with the prospect of... actual breasts growing out of his chest...<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fine honey?&quot; Lizzy's mother quickly held her by her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm all right. It's nothing!&quot; Josh squealed in his little voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to watch out sweetie! When I was your age I also would sometimes get dizzy out of the blue - it's a natural part of your body growing up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that all too well!&quot; Josh yanked his arm out of his new mother's grasp. On every step he was being reminded of how bad his position were.<br />
<br />
As he was standing back up, he realized that what he was wearing had spontaneously changed again, most likely to reflect fashions for girls of different ages, as he was still growing up. He looked down at himself. His dress was grey and was pinned high at his waist, almost below where his bust line would appear if he had it already. It had short sleeves, clinging tightly to his thin arms, and it went almost all the way up to his neck meaning that for once he won't have to be annoyed my the sight of his budding cleavage every time he looked down. On the other hand... He could clearly see two lumps poking out through the dress' fabric on his chest. They seemed to be sticking out about an inch already and the fact that they were constantly in contact with the tightly clinging fabric definitely didn't help with their itching...<br />
<br />
Apart from that Josh also felt something weird about his legs. He bend forward to look at them and gasped. His legs were now enclosed in a pair of very long tube socks. They reached a couple of inches above his knees so that essentially they begun where his dress ended. They were covered in a pattern of gray and white, wide, vertical stripes. The socks felt... bizarre. They clung to almost the whole length of his leg and Josh could only compare the feeling with the moment when he was growing out of his thermals and they became too tight. It didn't feel right...<br />
<br />
But then the investigation of his new wardrobe was interrupted as Mark's mom spoke again...</p>
