<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">< CHANGE COMPLETE... PLEASE SELECT A NEW TARGET FOR FURTHER CHANGES ><br />
Your phone beeped as your boss walked away.<br />
<br />
You take the seeds from your now-hippo boss and continue her task of going through and feeding the various birds in the sanctuary, you couldn&#39;t help but relish in your newfound power - and to put it bluntly, you were specifically considering how much of this power you could abuse. Your job was on the whole boring and utterly uninspired, truthfully you took it because you thought it&#39;d get you closer to nature and get you out of the house, something which you desperately needed in the last few months, but in reality, you would often find yourself doing boring, repetitive, menial tasks for your higherups and the frankly rude visitors at the zoo. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t learn much new about animals that you didn&#39;t know before, and your job just ended up making you wish you hadn&#39;t gotten it. Nothing ever changed, it was all the same meaningless cycle day in and day out. Wake up, go to work, feed the birds, clean the animal cages while they were away at shows, help maintain the train system in the zoo, as well as occasionally help in the on-gift shop and restaurant when things were low staff-wise. You were considering quitting because of this. Though, with this app in your possession, your day was about to get a lot more interesting.<br />
----<br />
The first person your attention was drawn to was your boss. The woman you had already changed. Maybe you wanted to experiment on her some more? You didn&#39;t know if you wanted to leave her how she was or not. You selected her on the app again, reading the sentence it gave you.<br />
<br />
< SCAN COMPLETE, CREATING SENTENCE......  &quot;The hippo woman continues her work duties&quot; ><br />
<br />
Well, that was something. Enough to work with, at least for an initial new change. You could get back at her even more for all of the shit she put you through daily, your boss always has been somewhat of a bitch to you in the past. But a part of you also wanted to take stock of the other potential change-ees in the zoo today. Just around you alone, there were plenty of options, and the idea of changing any of them was enticing to you, your almost god-like power being a bit much to handle.<br />
----<br />
Looking over to your left you saw a cute couple, cuddled up against each other and pointing at various birds flying about in the sanctuary. The two women were chattering amongst themselves - from what you could gather listening to their conversation the one on the left was named Amy and the one on the right was named Amelia. Amy being a shorter petite woman of clearly Asian descent, had a yellow sundress on and sunglasses. Whilst Amelia was very different - a tall, muscular woman in a tank top. Despite their differences in appearance, the two were very close as they laughed and conversed. You took the app and scanned them.<br />
<br />
< SCAN COMPLETE, CREATING SENTENCE......  &quot;A loving lesbian couple enjoy their trip at the zoo&quot; ><br />
<br />
Just like with your boss there were a lot of enticing options here you could already see in your head for how to change the two, but again, you wanted to give yourself options. Once more you selected the button on the app to add another option to the queue and looked around for a new target.<br />
----<br />
It didn&#39;t take you too long to find a new potential target, that&#39;s for sure. As the next target on your list was practically begging for your attention. Over in the gift shop that was attached to the bird sanctuary you could hear what sounded like a girl mouthing something off angrily to the attendant at the shop - the attendant being a friend of yours, Emily who was just staring at the girl with a tired expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear! The prices here are outrageous - and this whole place is just so filthy... half of the animals were ASLEEP when walking through, it cost me $20 to get in here, I was expecting a little more action.&quot; the girl said, who seemed to be around college age. Orange hair with two pigtails, a freckled face, and a face filled with frustration. She looked to be a bit tomboyish with her attire.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry your experience wasn&#39;t what you were hoping ma&#39;am but, unfortunately, I don&#39;t control that. I&#39;m just here to man the cash register&quot; Emily said with a sigh, leaning over on the counter and looking at the girl berating her with a tired expression. Classic day in customer service it seemed. As you watched the scene unfold you decided to make *two* selections.<br />
<br />
< SCAN COMPLETE, CREATING SENTENCE......  &quot;A bratty college girl argues with a gift shop attendant&quot; ><br />
< SCAN COMPLETE, CREATING SENTENCE......  &quot;A tired cashier listens to an angry customer&#39;s complaints&quot; ><br />
<br />
These were both good options. You smirked to yourself. You were starting to build a rather large roster of potential changes but you still thought you could get higher. Maybe two more. As you looked around your attention was quickly grabbed by another sight, another unruly guest though they were unruly for a completely different reason.<br />
----<br />
Over at one of the farther corners of the bird sanctuary, there was a man seemingly trying to mess with the birds. Doing various things to startle them or just inconvenience them. Baiting them with birdseed before smacking them. Truly &#39;human trash&#39; behavior that made you scoff. You didn&#39;t like your job here much but at the very least you treated the animals with respect. Visitors like him always made you angry. Aiming your phone you added him to your roster, generating a sentence for him.<br />
<br />
< SCAN COMPLETE, CREATING SENTENCE......  &quot;A man messes with the birds in their enclosure&quot; ><br />
<br />
You decided to keep this one in your back pocket. You were already thinking of potential things you could do to this dude. Maybe give him a taste of his own medicine? That was a future you problem. To clear your head you looked out for your last selection, for this part of the zoo at least.<br />
----<br />
Your gaze would eventually land on a much more calming sight. A single mother sitting alone on a bench while two children ran around her, pointing at the birds and talking to each other. She looked tired but smiled nonetheless. You didn&#39;t feel any ill-will towards her, but you could still see the potential changes in this. You took your phone and scanned her as well reading the sentence it gave you.<br />
<br />
< SCAN COMPLETE, CREATING SENTENCE......  &quot;A single mother tiredly watches her kids at the zoo&quot; ><br />
<br />
The sentence confirmed your thoughts on the woman&#39;s predicament.<br />
---<br />
<br />
Well, now you had a queue filled with a ton of potential changes you could make to the visitors around you. Now the question was, who would you change first? Your boss again, the lovely lesbian couple, the bratty college girl, your friend Emily, the man messing with the birds, or the single mother? Decisions decisions... all options had the potential to make the day more interesting, but you had to choose carefully. After giving it some thought you decided you were going to change...</p>
