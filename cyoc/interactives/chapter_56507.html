<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The red rubber clad young hunky Santa stretched, and flexed his <br />
fingers together.  He was the Christmas Spirit for the 21st Century.  <br />
He wasn't exactly Batman, but he was a superhero of sorts.  He not <br />
merely gave presents, but justice.  His bag had change to fit the new <br />
Santa's personality.  <br />
<br />
He reached in the bag and extracted and large foil covered cardboard <br />
box for Timmy, who lived in the dorm room below.  He frowned, the big <br />
box was very light. He opened the box lid and frowned it was empty. <br />
But the open box shifted in his hands. It knew what should be filling <br />
it. It guided Santa like a dowsing rod toward the room three doors <br />
down.  The walls opened to admit Santa and the empty box as the rooms <br />
occupants were frozen in time.  That room was the dorm shower room. A <br />
buff blond jock was dripping wet and just stepping out of the showers <br />
and reaching for his towel. The box leapt in Santa's hand to welcome <br />
the foot frozen in mid stride. As soon as the young man's foot was in <br />
the box it deflated like an empty balloon or pool toy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the?&quot; murmured Santa unsure about what was happening.  He looked <br />
up into the cold steel blue eyes of naked young man and he understood.<br />
<br />
Hannibal Lechter was unfortunately named.  His father had been a fan <br />
of the A-Team, and wasn't much of a reader.  So little Hannibal was <br />
already one when the first Hannibal Lecter film hit the big screen in <br />
1991.  School was hell for Hannibal, but he embraced his name and at <br />
the age of 5 went trick or treating strapped to a dolly wearing a ski <br />
mask.  The older boy who wore the cop uniform and pushed him door to <br />
door did it not because he liked Hannibal or because he thought it was <br />
a cool idea - he did it because he was afraid of the 5 year old.  To <br />
say that Hannibal's name was solely responsible for his bullying <br />
nature is untrue.  He and his name seemed suited for each other. Timmy <br />
was merely the latest victim in Hannibal's long long list of victims. <br />
Timmy had left his dorm door open. Hannibal had just had a fight with <br />
his girlfriend.  He was horny, drunk and badly needed relief for his <br />
boner. Timmy wasn't gay, but Hannibal didn't care. <br />
<br />
Santa relived the moment.  Timmy was sitting at his computer terminal <br />
researching his term paper. The door was open for ventillation as the <br />
air conditioner had broken down.  It was a hot muggy mid September <br />
day. Hannibal had just exited the elevator.  He was scratching his <br />
crotch.  He badly needed a blow job.  Timmy had the misfortune of <br />
being the first person Hannibal saw. He spun Timmy around in his <br />
chair, shoved his half hard cock into Timmy's surprised mouth.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Suck like your life depended on it, cause it does. Knick me with one <br />
of your teeth, and I'll pull that tooth out. Fuck I'll remove all your <br />
teeth, if you bite. Ah, that feelsh good,&quot; he moaned as he slid his <br />
manhood in and out of Timmy's mouth.  <br />
<br />
Timmy was in shock. Hannibal outweighed him by 60 lbs. Hannibal's <br />
powerful hands held Timmy's shoulders pinning his arms to his side. It <br />
all happened so fast, and Hannibal did most of the work. Timmy just <br />
stood there slack-jawed.  If he hadn't Hannibal would have probably <br />
broken his jaw and extracted all his teeth. It was only a couple <br />
minutes before Hannibal came. He smiled down at Timmy acknowledging <br />
him for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did good. I'm sure you'll do better next time,&quot; he said as he <br />
wiped his slimy cock off on Timmy's hair.  He glanced at the paper <br />
name plate as he left and added, &quot;Timmy, you did real good, from now <br />
on your Hannibal Lechter's personal cockslave.&quot;<br />
<br />
In fear and disgust, Timmy swallowed audibly. He was horrified as he <br />
realized he'd just swallowed Hannibal's load.  Hannibal on the other <br />
hand was pleased.  The bastard reached into his back pocket opened his <br />
wallet and tossed a $20 bill on the floor. He didn't say anything, but <br />
Timmy could hear his thoughts.  The bastard had gotten him to swallow <br />
his load without even ordering him to do it.<br />
<br />
Timmy reached for the bill to wad it up and throw it back at Hannibal <br />
or to tear it up, but when his hand touched the bill, he realized how <br />
much he needed that money to cover his school books.  He had a grant <br />
and loan to pay tuition and the dorm room, but extras like books and <br />
food. Santa frowned. Hannibal went through girlfriends like they were <br />
tissues.  So over the next few months, Timmy earned lots of tips, <br />
though the denomination dropped from Jackson to Lincoln and <br />
Washington.  Hannibal was not someone anyone said no to more than <br />
once.  If he hadn't been a star athlete, and the son of Senator, well, <br />
he was, so he got away with it, at least until now.<br />
<br />
Santa lifted box as Hannibal's calf and knee collapsed into flat <br />
fleshtone rubber. At last only Hannibal's head and shoulders were <br />
outside the box and still human.  Santa touched his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; he shrieked.<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on it will be Timmy's cock in your hungry holes, sex doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hu-mssssssssssssssssss&quot; hissed Hannibal as the rubber gloved hand <br />
forced his head down into the box where it promptly deflated.  Santa <br />
and the box made a few last minute changes to the INFLATABLE SHE-MALE <br />
REAL DOLL.  It had red painted lips on the o-shaped mouth that was <br />
still recognizable as Hannibal Lechter.  The hair was blonde still, <br />
but now longer than his former buzz cut. His nipples were a bit more <br />
swollen, and were decorated with piercings. In addition to his cock, <br />
Hannibal now sported a vagina under his empty rubber ball sac.  Santa <br />
walked back through the walls to Timmy's room and set the box <br />
containing Hannibal at the foot of Timmy's bed.<br />
<br />
He checked his list and Timmy's name was now checked off.  On the <br />
naughty list a red line burned through Hannibal Lechter's name.</p>
