<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve felt her finger impact on the phone as more waves of fire began pulsating out of her womb.  The pressure increased, the baby’s head bore down into the fibrous wall of her cervix, and Steve knew that she had lost.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t deal with the pain, much less the sight of her own gravid, laboring body.  Eyes closed; Steve began to come to terms with a situation that she’d never thought she’d be in.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it was true that she was a furry.  And yes, it was true that she had a thing for pregnant furs.  But she’d never wanted to be a pregnant furry, much less to give birth as one.  And yet, here she was.  She’d woken up this morning as a human man, but now she was an anthro rabbit.  And while the labor that her body was subjecting her to would probably keep her from going to sleep tonight, she knew that the next time she woke up it was going to be in a body that was as far as her old one as it could be.<br />
<br />
She would wake to the feeling of two greedy mouths sucking on breasts that she wasn’t supposed to have.  Her eyes would open to the sight of the top of her muzzle and her now permanent coat of grey fur.  He was now a she, and there was nothing that she was going to be able to do to change it.<br />
<br />
Steve’s mind swirled with a mixture of lament and submissive acceptance as her body swirled with a mixture of pressure of pain.  This was it; this was her life.  The burning, stretching pain kept spreading deeper into her body, flooding her mind with agony when…<br />
<br />
It stopped.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t like before when the contraction had ended.  No, this was more than that – the pressure, the pain, the muscles, everything just stopped.  Was she dead?<br />
<br />
Steve felt her stomach sucking in, almost like she was taking the deepest breath she ever had, except instead of filling her lungs with air she was sucking the very essence out of her belly.  Then there was a tugging, growing sensation in her crotch.  It started small at first, almost like her clit was growing erect, but it didn’t stop.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes and looked down towards her stomach, past her flat chest, to see masculine, human hands pressing against a white t-shirt.  Her cock kept growing until she could feel it pressing against the inside of her under pants, while two balls were similarly cupped beneath her.  She was… no, *he* was a man again?<br />
<br />
Steve looked up in the mirror to see a muscular looking late 20s man – a human man – staring back at him.  That was… him?  That was Steve?  It didn’t look like him, but as he raised a hand to his face, he saw the man in mirror run do the same.  It was him!  Except it wasn’t, or at least he didn’t look anything like what he used to.<br />
<br />
Looking down at the app, Steve saw the sentence it displayed:<br />
<br />
“The male human is in the bathroom.”<br />
<br />
Steve had managed to hit the submit button, thank god, and those last few seconds of labor were likely the app’s twisted send off to a barely avoided tragedy.  Then there was the question of why Steve’s body looked so different, though the answer to that was obvious: the sentence stated that a male human was in the bathroom, it didn’t say what that male human looked like.<br />
<br />
In typical monkey paw fashion, the app had turned Steve into a male human, but not into *him*.  Still, Steve’s new body appeared to be healthy, fit, and most importantly not in the throes of labor.  Whatever problems might exist due to the fact that the picture on Steve’s drivers license didn’t match his face were things that he could deal with later.  For now, he needed to deal with the still unconscious anthro rabbit next to the toilet, then get the hell out of this mall.<br />
<br />
“Ding.”<br />
<br />
Steve opened the app up and selected the rabbit:<br />
<br />
“The anthro rabbit is laying next to the toilet.”<br />
<br />
Steve had expected the app to throw him another curveball, but that sentence was shockingly easy to work with.  Steve changed the word “anthro” to “plush” and within a few seconds, the semi-animate anthro rabbit had shrunk down into a cute, inanimate plush.  <br />
<br />
The transformation of the living person into an inanimate object brought another issue to the fore – an inanimate object like that couldn’t get high.  It also couldn’t think, at least not ordinarily, but the app’s intro screen made it sound like a person would retain awareness regardless of what they were transformed into.  Did that mean that the now “sober” plush was awake?<br />
<br />
“Ding.”<br />
<br />
Steve targeted the plush and generated a sentence:<br />
<br />
“The Randy Rabbit toy is scared and confused.”<br />
<br />
Well, that at least answered that question.  Now that the addict had been turned into a plush, he was fully aware of his surroundings.  And from the complete lack of movement coming from the stuffed animal, it stood to reason that it was completely unable to move – despite its awareness.<br />
<br />
Steve could change the sentence to help the man out, but at the same time Steve was well aware of just how bad that could go.  After all, why had the app turned him into a female rabbit when he’d used it?<br />
<br />
The most obvious answer was the seemingly malicious nature of the app – it had seen an opportunity to ruin Steve’s life and had taken it.  Still, Steve knew that there was more to it than that.  The app was malicious, yes, but Steve had also made a mistake in that he had fed it a situation that was easy for it to abuse.<br />
<br />
He’d set up a locked room with a drug addict anthro rabbit in it.  He had then created an immense amount of ambiguity in the sentence affecting him.  The app had just taken advantage of that – after all, why would there be two anthropomorphic animals together in a locked bathroom?<br />
<br />
Sure, if the app was less malicious it might have made it so that Steve was just “friends” with the drug addict, but that might not necessarily have been a better option for Steve as it could have resulted in him also od’ing.  In a weird way, turning Steve into the rabbit’s “wife” and then only having her take pills was a sort of middle ground.  It wasn’t the best outcome, but it wasn’t the worst.  <br />
<br />
Then there was the pregnancy and labor.  While that certainly wasn’t necessary, it did mean that Steve couldn’t just immediately back out while, at the same time, giving Steve a viable path to escape his fate.<br />
<br />
Man, Steve felt exhausted thinking about all of that.  It made sense in a weird sort of way but left Steve wondering what the true nature of this app was.  Whatever the app’s purpose, the only thing for Steve to do was to get out here.  Leaving the plush to its fate, Steve exited the bathroom and began walking towards his car.</p>
