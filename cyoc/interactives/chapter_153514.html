<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Johnny fell blissfully off to sleep, puberty completely gone from his now preteen boy body, an error message popped up on the computer screen.<br />
<br />
Subjects relationship change incomplete. Correcting Error. Three beams of light suddenly emitted from the Chronivac and hit Johnny, Simon, and Kim, unbeknownst to them all, Johnny while he was sleeping, Simon and Kim while Simon was trying to beg off his overly eager wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re always tired,&quot; complained Kim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry that making enough money to support our family lifestyle upsets you,&quot; countered Simon as he took off his work clothes and stripped without ceremony, completely ignoring the fact that Kim had dressed in her &quot;sexy&quot; sleepwear which would normally have him as hard as a tent pole, but now was only irritating him with how she wanted more from him. Everybody wanted more from him whether it was his boss, his wife, even his god damned mouth son. There was only so much Simon was willing to allow before he snapped, and he was dangerously drawing close to it. Oh to be younger and to have less responsibilities, he pined.<br />
<br />
Back in Johnny&#39;s room, he was tossing in his sleep, seemingly having a nightmare where the world kept getting larger and larger and was only emphasizing how small and tiny he felt all the time thanks to his ginormous Daddy. Funnily enough, Johnny actually was shrinking, or rather growing younger at a faster pace than he had for the last few days. His body was pulling in on itself, limbs becoming shorter and stubbier as middle school turned to grade school. Baby fat soon began accumulating at an accelerating rate around his tummy, and his fingers shrunk into clumsy crayon grippers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Simon and Kim&#39;s room, they themselves were losing years in correspondence with the amount that Johnny was losing, tying the transformation all together. Suddenly Simon was a bit less frustrated and a bit less tired than he had been a few moments ago, and a lot more appreciative of Kim&#39;s sexy night gown with the low cut barely hidden by a thin strip of lace atop her perking up breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry for snapping at you, I just had a rough day at work, and--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I know just the remedy for a rough day at work, for both of us,&quot; said Kim with a wicked smile as she leaned in to rub Simon&#39;s shoulders and kiss.<br />
<br />
The nightmare seemed to grow scarier for Johnny as his regression intensified into his toddlerhood, baby fat overtaking his body completely into a chubby small toddler. The nightmare intensified to the point where Johnny began to call out for his Mommy in his sleep.<br />
<br />
Kim broke off the kiss once she heard Johnny&#39;s scream, and groaned. She thought that he&#39;d finally grown out of the night terrors, apparently her baby had not.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; said Kim as she left her husband who&#39;d over the course of her running her hands over his naked torso, managed to arouse him into at least a partial arousal that had been getting stiffer by the moment. Hopefully he could maintain it until the baby was finished with whatever he needed.<br />
<br />
Infancy had claimed Johnny by the time that Kim entered the now nursery of her son, and his cries for Mommy had lost their words as they shifted into an infant&#39;s scream. He was likely hungry, Kim thought, and she shifted the strap of her night gown down before scooping Johnny up into her arms and bringing the shrinking infant up to her growing breasts, filling with mother&#39;s milk that Johnny began to suckle at, calming and quieting him down.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s own body really began to shift now as her abdomen began to swell, her uterus stretching and forming a placenta and umbilical chord in preparation for its newest occupant. Johnny meanwhile grew smaller and frailer as he came closer and closer to being a newborn, at which point the umbilical chord slithered out from Kim and attached itself to Johnny, hitting Kim with an odd wave of endorphins to balance out the pain that was about to occur.<br />
<br />
Simon meanwhile had resorted to masturbating while he was waiting for Kim to return. Now that she was pregnant she had to get up and waddle to the bathroom more frequently than usual, and sometimes even in the midst of when they were getting ready to do what limited sex they could have with her stomach so swollen.<br />
<br />
By the time Kim had waddled back into their room she was now rounding from the third trimester to the second, her swollen stomach beginning to really pull in and seemingly melt away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, you&#39;re back,&quot; said a much more eager, Simon, the gray having disappeared from his temples and his beard having retracted in as he reached a younger stage of his adulthood and marriage, a more energetic and eager time. Simon stood and began to kiss his youthful wife who&#39;d regressed with him as crow&#39;s feet and laugh lines smoothed themselves away and her hair grew fuller and silkier as she joined Simon at age 30, a full twelve years and nine months younger than she&#39;d been an hour ago. <br />
<br />
Simon&#39;s veritable tent pole was sticking right in Kim&#39;s pubic triangle as they kissed, just below her shrinking belly. As she passed from her second trimester and into her first, Kim felt herself and uptick in horniness and desire, and pushed Simon back onto the bed as memories of finding out she was pregnant began to fade from her memory and Simon and Kim began positioning themselves for her to ride his rod like a bronco. Johnny&#39;s embryo continually simplified and shrunk within Kim&#39;s womb until he was nothing more than a fertilized egg attached to her uterus&#39; wall, and then he unattached and separated into an egg and sperm, the sperm feeling fulled back by what felt like the force of gravity as it was sucked along with plenty of other sperm that had leaked into Kim&#39;s womb before now back into Simon&#39;s throbbing penis, finishing the act of unconceiving Johnny. As his sperm traveled backwards and undeveloped further into the basic building blocks of a sperm, Johnny&#39;s DNA in both his egg half and his sperm half was broken down and rewritten to match his new parents&#39; DNA so that on a biological level as well as a mental and social level he&#39;d be their son.</p>
