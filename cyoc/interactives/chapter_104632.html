<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David was sat in the living room pouting. His friend had really pissed him off and he was in a foul mood. His Dad was acting weird as well. He kept looking at him and then snapping his head away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; His dad looked over at him from the other couch. &quot;Where&#39;s Michael?&quot; His dad looked slightly panicked and then calmed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s upstairs in his room I think? I... gave him his toy chest and left him to it.&quot; He paused and then took a breath. &quot;Anyway son, are you OK? From what you mom said...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; David snapped. He then stood up and went to see what Michael was up to. His father sat on the couch wringing his hands not sure what to do with himself. He didn&#39;t want David to find out about what he and Michael had been doing but he also was feeling... thirsty again.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Oi, pipsqueak, what you doing?&quot; David asked laughing while opening the door. Michael was sat on his knees with his back to him, the toy chest in front of him.<br />
<br />
Michael giggled. &quot;Pipsqueak? Yea ok David, if you say so.&quot; David frowned at this, the insult usually angered Michael but he shrugged it off like it was nothing. &quot;Anyway I was about to get changed.&quot; Michael stood up and took of his t-shirt.<br />
<br />
David and Michael had changed in front of each other many times, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. Michael then took of his jeans, his back still to David. Then his underwear... there was a loud smack as flesh his flesh and David caught the glimpse of something swinging between his baby brother&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is...&quot; He turned Michael around, spinning him slightly and then fell back onto his bum. Looking straight at the immense cock in front of him he began to stammer. &quot;Bu... bu... wh... wh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael crossed his arms and began to chuckle, a moment later he twisted his hips from side to side and let his cock slap against his thighs. David&#39;s eyes followed it, mesmerised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s a pipsqueak? Cause I think I am a lot and I mean a lot bigger than you in one place Davey!&quot; Michael laughed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son? Everything...&quot; His dad began to shout upstairs but was cut off by Michael&#39;s &quot;Yea fine dad, stay down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
David was trying to take this all in. His baby brother now sported a cock bigger than anything he&#39;d ever seen in real life, bigger than he&#39;d seen in porn on the internet in fact. He just spoke to his Dad and gave him a command and he obeyed it without a pause. And he was on his back looking at it... watching it...<br />
<br />
&quot;So Davey, want to compare? My cock against yours?&quot; Michael took a step towards his older brother and made a grab for his trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck Michael! No!&quot; He grabbed his brother&#39;s wrist and twisted it. Michael yelped. &quot;I&#39;m still stronger than you Michael... this is... this is fucked up but don&#39;t forget that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael rubbed his wrist and held back tears. He flashed his eyes at David and muttered something. Turning away he rummaged in his jeans for a moment. David tried to see what he was rummaging for but couldn&#39;t. He tried to stand up again.<br />
<br />
Michael clutched the ring and whispered angrily to it. &quot;I wish I was a hundred times stronger than David.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say? What are you doing?&quot; David began to advance on Michael. Michael dropped the ring and kicked his jeans over it.<br />
<br />
David grabbed Michael&#39;s shoulder to turn him back to face him. Michael didn&#39;t budge. At all. In fact David couldn&#39;t even dent Michael&#39;s skin with his grips, it was like holding a warm rock. Michael laughed. It was a high laugh but somehow it sounded menacing to David.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mikey? What the fuck...&quot; Before he could finish the question Michael has turned and grabbed his brother&#39;s wrist, it was like being held in a vice. He squeezed it ever so gently and David Felt to his knees, a silent scream opening his mouth. Luckily he hadn&#39;t broken any of his bones but it hurt, more than he imagined anything would.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then Davey... let&#39;s compare.&quot; Michael said this flatly and reached for his brothers trousers again. David tried to stop his brother&#39;s hands but couldn&#39;t move it at all. Michael&#39;s fingers gripped the top of them and one swift movement ripped them away. His brother felt the fabric burn across his lower back and the trousers split along the sides from his hips to his knees and fluttered to the ground. He was now in just his white underwear, his small bulge on show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww looks like I might have beat you Davey?&quot; Michael teased in a sing-song voice. &quot;But to be sure...&quot; Another quick movement and the same friction burning feeling across his back and sides and he was without his underwear. There was a light sound of his cock smacking against his left thigh but it sounded quiet and small. He had tears in his eyes, from the pain mixed with intense shame.<br />
<br />
Michael laughed a deep belly laugh and pointed at his brother&#39;s 2.5 inch cock. &quot;It&#39;s so small Davey, I mean it&#39;s just tiny! I&#39;m even bigger than Dad&#39;s now. I mean even soft like this,&quot; he shook his cock again, the loud slap of it hitting his thighs making David shy away, &quot;it&#39;s bigger than his hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael... please...&quot; David begged, &quot;You&#39;re hurting me...&quot; Michael smiled and then let go. His brother, in his tattered trousers, rubbed his wrist and tried to cover up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you know who&#39;s bigger and stronger now Davey. Now go get changed and send Dad up. Tell him he&#39;s thirsty... actually no.&quot; Michael stepped past David and yelled through the door. &quot;Dad, come up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Son? Are you...?&quot; Cut off again Michael replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now.&quot;</p>
