<br />
Jason Wilcox sat swirling his coffee waiting for the clock to tick to 10.30am. Today was a big day. He needed this internship. Jason had spent the last 7 years travelling the world, surfing, partying and having a great time. At 27 he&#39;d just started university and needed this internship to help him fund his degree.<br />
He&#39;d been applying for jobs for the last 6 months but hadn&#39;t had any success. This was his second interview, he&#39;d finally received a call back and he wanted to impress the panel.<br />
<br />
He sat up from the table and walked across the road, this was his time and he wanted to make it. He entered the lobby, signed in and waited for the elevator. The interview was on the 50th floor. He hopped in the elevator and positioned himself in the far right corner. The elevator soon filled up to the maximum limit. He was squashed at the back but didn&#39;t mind, he was thinking of the interview.<br />
He also didn&#39;t mind as in front of him was a vision of beauty, an older woman, probably late 40’s or early 50’s was in front of him. She smelt fantastic. Jason had always been aroused by the smell of some women and this one was special. His groin started to twitch as he looked at her from behind. <br />
<br />
Jason stood there staring at her when all of a sudden she backed into him, her ass in her tight skirt was firmly against his groin as another few people entered the elevator. His cock was firmly positioned between the cheeks of her tight ass. He felt her wiggle to fully trap his hardening cock. He tried to move sideways but her hands reached behind to stop him. She wanted this, he couldn&#39;t believe it. She slowly ground her ass against his cock, not once turning around to look at him. It felt so nice. He just stood there and let her, her head was only inches away and he was intoxicated from her smell. His cock was throbbing as she rubbed her ass up and down the shaft, her heard her moan slightly.<br />
<br />
She reached for her bag and dropped it as people got off the lift, even though there was more room she never moved. She bent over to retrieve it, her ass still locked on him. In the bent over position she pushed back hard, his cock firmly wedged. He was loving this as his cock started to throb.<br />
<br />
The elevator stopped at the 45th floor, she turned around and looked at him, smiled and dropped something in his top pocket. She quickly exited as he stood there in total disbelief. His mind was blank. The doors shut and he quickly adjusted himself. Trying to concentrate on the interview.<br />
<br />
He arrived for the interview and signed in. He waited to be called. He entered the room and sat before the panel of 5, noticing one panel member wasn&#39;t there.<br />
All of a sudden a door opened and he smelt a familiar smell, it was her. She walked to the front of the room and sat down. She was the panel chairperson.<br />
She looked at him and smiled, apologised for being late and introduced herself and the panel. Her name was Jennifer Smyth or Jenny as she liked to be called. Jason sat there transfixed. The panel started asking questions and he was answering to their satisfaction, he was impressing them. He felt it was going really well.<br />
He reached in his top pocket and pulled out a note, it was her number and room .<br />
Suddenly Jenny spoke. She told the panel members she was happy with Jason and would like to have him work under her. She winked at this innuendo. He smiled back. She was the CEO and in charge of the panel so they all agreed. She asked Jason if he had time to come with her so she could show him around. He had plenty of time so agreed. He followed her to the elevator and stepped in, making sure he went to the back. Jenny followed right in front of him. This time they were alone so she turned and looked at him, her hand on his crotch. She whispered to him that she hoped he would be willing to do anything for her considering she had approved his job application. He nodded at her and she smiled.<br />
<br />
They walked into her office and she locked the door. She told him to lie down on the carpet and to not move. She stood above his face as he looked up to her wet silky panties. She raised her skirt and lowered her body onto his face. He lay still as she slowly ground her pussy over his face. It smelt like the rest of her, so beautiful. She leant forward and unzipped his trousers and pulled out his hard cock. She loved it from the first moment she saw it. She started to tug on it when her intercom buzzed. It was her secretary advising of her important meeting. She swore but told the secretary to give her 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
She hopped of Jason and told him to come to her desk. She told him to kneel down under her desk and not move. She&#39;d had the desk especially made to suit. She grabbed his arms and locked them in restraints she&#39;d made. She then put a harness on his head to hold him in place. Jason was her prisoner under her desk, he couldn&#39;t move his body or head. Jenny had taken off her panties and moved her chair into place. Jason could do nothing but stare at her wonderful pussy. She looked down at him and said he&#39;d better start sucking if he wanted to keep his job. He stuck his tongue out and started. He heard someone enter and Jenny started to talk to the person. Jason really worked hard on pleasing her as she talked. After about 20 minutes he heard the door slam. Jenny grabbed his head and drove her pussy into it. She started to moan as she squirted all over his face. He kept lapping it up.<br />
<br />
She hopped off her chair, he smiled as he thought he was done. Next thing someone else is sitting on the chair, she was wearing no panties. She moved the chair into the position. Jenny said to Jason.<br />
“Hi Jason, meet Melanie, she&#39;s my personal assistant, please satisfy her”</p>
