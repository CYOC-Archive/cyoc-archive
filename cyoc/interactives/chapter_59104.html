<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jon left the house, leaving his slightly taller younger brother checking out himself in the <br />
mirror, and got on his bike.  He peddaled off, phone in his pocket, heading to his friend <br />
Bill's house.  It was only three blocks away, but as Jon hurried through, it seemed he ran <br />
into ever neighbor, had to wait on a dozen cars, and a couple of dogs.  Everything seemed <br />
to be getting in his way, preventing him from getting to his friends.  <br />
<br />
Finally, he pulled into Bill's Driveway and tossed his bike beside the garage wall.  Ringing <br />
the doorbell brought Bill's older brother, Tony.  Tony looked down at Jon, smiling  &quot;Hey, <br />
here for Bill?&quot; he asked.  <br />
<br />
Tony had always gotten along well with Bill and Jon.  He could drive, being three years <br />
older, and so he'd take the boys out to the mall or movies when the asked.  Tony stood <br />
about 5'6&quot;, just an inch taller than Jon.  <br />
<br />
Tony backed away, letting Jon in, while calling for his little brother.  Jon said bye and <br />
bound up the steps, heading to his friend's room.  &quot;Bill, you here?&quot; Jon asks, barging into <br />
the bedroom.  <br />
<br />
Bill looks up, shocked, pushing away a magazine.  &quot;Jon...dude, shut the door&quot; he says, his <br />
hands cupping his crotch.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Bill...&quot; Jon chuckles, aware his best friend had been choking the chicken.  &quot;Really?&quot; Jon <br />
replies, shutting the door and clicking the lock shut.  &quot;You should have locked it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do... but my mom...she's gotten so clingy all of the sudden&quot; Bill grumbled, as he shoved <br />
his dick away, while Jon picked up the magazine.  The cover was playboy, but inside, Big <br />
burly guys flexed and smoldered across the page.  Bunches of big men, some bulky and <br />
some ripped, all hairy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa... what's this?&quot; Jon asked, looking at the pictures.<br />
<br />
&quot;What..whoa...why are you looking at that?&quot; Bill gasps.  He reaches to grab the magazine <br />
away, but Jon, like any 13 year old, pulled the magazine away.  &quot;Gimme&quot; Bill chirps.<br />
<br />
Jon looks at his friend and hands the magazine back, asking &quot;So...what is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just... oh whatever... you'll just make fun of me like my mom&quot; Bill heaves with a sigh.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're... gay?&quot; Jon asks, his voice soft.  Bill doesn't answer, just one jerky nod.<br />
<br />
Jon smiles big and grabs his friend from behind, wrapping him in a tight hug.  &quot;That's so <br />
awesome... I though I was the only one.&quot;  Bill nearly collapsed into Jon's hug, a sad sob of <br />
relief wracking him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried keeping it a secret... but my mother...she's incessantly in my buisness.  Tony's tried <br />
pulling her away, but she keeps attacking.   &quot;If dad was still here...&quot; he trails off.  Bill's dad <br />
had left his mom in a tryst, sleeping with his secretary.   That his secretary had been a guy <br />
from the city, had pissed Bill's mom off immensely.  As a result, it'd pushed her into a bad <br />
mood towards men, especially gays.  She was as bad as that Phelps clan sometimes.  All <br />
this drama had put its mark on Bill.<br />
<br />
A buzz from his pocket reminded Jon of why he'd come over.  &quot;Dude...I've got something <br />
you've got to see!&quot; He says, getting excited, as he hands Bill a kleenex from the table and <br />
pulls out his phone.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You got a new phone?&quot; Bill asks, blowing into his tissue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...and you gotta see this app that came with it&quot; Jon smiles, clicking open his phone <br />
and bringing up the TF-TEXT application.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What's it do?&quot; Bill asks, looking at the plain text app.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude... I gotta show you.&quot; Jon gets up and heads over to the door.  Cracking it open, Jon <br />
spies Tony sitting down at the couch.  &quot;See your older brother?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Bill nods &quot;yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well keep watching.&quot; Jon says, typing into his phone.  &quot;Make Tony grow a super dense, <br />
inch thick beard, grow a lot of body hair, gain 60lbs of beef and grow 10&quot; taller.&quot;  SEND.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Tony felt something tingle about him, as he read his homework.  The tingling grew, as an <br />
itching spread over his face.  He scratched at it, and noticed more stubble.  A lot more <br />
stubble.  He stood up and felt himself get light headed, as he heard a weird sound, like <br />
balloons rubbing against one another.  The perpsective in the room was off, and as he <br />
looked down, he was shocked.  His shirt was untucked, puckering out over a larger belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the..&quot; Tony grunts, as he watches his chest push forward, stretching his shirt again.  <br />
His sleeves grow tight, as Tony watches his biceps swell.  Hair is starting to curl out of it, as <br />
the skin tingle grows into a fire. &quot;Ahh&quot; He grunts feeling his pants get very tight, the hem <br />
creeping up and tearing as they rose up his thicker calves.  Tony felt it surge, his breath <br />
quickened and his pulse raced, and he felt his manhood tingle and erupt, spurting into his <br />
boxers.  The tingling fades as Tony looks down, or attempts to, as his gut is now in the <br />
way.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot; Tony says, looking around, his now 6'4&quot; thick body.  He guessed <br />
he weighed about 270 or so.  He felt so heavy, as he rubbed around himself.  His hands <br />
reached up and found a thick full beard growing from his cheeks.  It felt so good.  He <br />
hurried over to the mirror to look at his reflection.  A burly bearded man smiled back, the <br />
thick beard crept up high on his cheeks, and went all the way down to the now growing <br />
chest hair.  The dark hair curled out over his collar, just slight, but it felt amazing to rub, <br />
especially with his fingers.  &quot;Whatever it is...is awesome&quot; Tony whispers.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;See what i mean?&quot; Jon smiled, as Bill's eyes gawked at his new burly brother.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What'll happen now to him?&quot; Bill asks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I don't do anything more, he'll go through a later puberty and get bigger.&quot; Jon <br />
grinned.  <br />
<br />
Bill blinked, shocked and speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;What shall we do next?&quot; Jon grins like the Cheshire Cat, holding out his cellphone to Bill.</p>
