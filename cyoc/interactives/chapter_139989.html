			<br />
			Jeff turned the last page of the catalog, then set it on the end table and sighed. He glanced across the room at his girlfriend, Holly, who was similarly looking through a catalog. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Nothing,&quot; he reported with disgust when Holly glanced up at him.<br />
			<br />
			Holly frowned. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;There&#39;s _got_ to be something,&quot; she protested. &quot;Vampires?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Done it,&quot; Jeff snorted. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not very original.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;How about Frankenstein and the Bride?&quot; Holly asked hopefully as she scanned a page.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Three years ago, remember?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Oh, yeah. I forgot.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She flipped a couple of pages, and her face lit up. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What about this?&quot; she asked excitedly, holding up the catalog for Jeff to see. &quot;Pirates?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff shook his head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Dan and Angela are going as pirates,&quot; he sighed. &quot;And Marty. And John.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Star Battles?” Holly offered hopefully.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff shook his head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Nope,&quot; he said with finality. &quot;Remember, Fred invited some of the guys from the 501st.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			The 501st was a Star Battles fan group that made fantastic replica costumes from the movies. Jeff knew that anything he and Holly could do would pale in comparison to the near-professional costumes of the 501st.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff leaned back on the sofa, stretching his arms and legs. Tall and muscular, Jeff prided himself on his well-toned body. With his reddish-brown hair, beard, and mustache, he bore more than a little resemblance to a Norse or Germanic warrior of old. <br />
			<br />
			The resemblance struck Holly quite suddenly. Unlike Jeff, she was petite - about five foot four - and lusciously slender. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What about Viking warriors?&quot; she offered.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff scratched his beard for a moment. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;It might work. But it&#39;s not that elaborate. It&#39;d be hard to win.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly sighed. Jeff was taking this costume contest much too seriously, just like he did every year. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Well, I&#39;m out of ideas. And we&#39;re almost out of time.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff sighed and picked up his beer bottle. &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly glanced at Jeff. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You need another one?&quot; she asked when she saw the bottle was nearly empty.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeff grunted. &quot;Thanks, sweetie.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly stood in her usual graceful manner; Jeff watched her every move, amazed and delighted that she could make a simple stroll across the kitchen into an art form. He knew he was lucky to have her, and he tried to make sure she knew how he felt. At the sound of his wolf whistle, she added a little extra wiggle to her butt.<br />
			<br />
			Just as she bent over to open the refrigerator door, her round sexy rear pointed deliberately at Jeff, the phone rang. For a moment, she debated letting the answering machine take the call, but then she picked up the receiver. <br />

			<br />
			&quot;Hello?&quot; she spoke, her word half greeting and half question.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Oh, hi!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Her features lit up with delight. She pulled the phone down from her mouth, her hand covering the mouthpiece. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;It&#39;s Fred,&quot; she announced to Jeff.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Great,&quot; Jeff muttered. &quot;As if I didn&#39;t remember the party is tomorrow night.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s scowl hushed him as she returned the phone to her ear. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said after a moment, &quot;we&#39;re planning on it. But we&#39;re having problems coming up with a good costume.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff scowled. He could imagine the look of triumph on Fred&#39;s face. He and Fred had been friendly rivals for as long as either could remember. In fact, both had competed for Holly&#39;s affection, and Jeff knew that Fred wasn&#39;t happy that he&#39;d lost.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Really?&quot; Holly asked, her voice rising in excitement. &quot;You&#39;re not kidding, are you?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff pondered. Had Fred just offered to partner with Holly for a costume? <br />
			<br />
			Almost as fast as it had come, the jealous thought was banished from Jeff&#39;s brain. Holly wasn&#39;t that type. She was loyal to Jeff. Even Fred wouldn&#39;t stoop so low as to try to steal Holly from him.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll see you tomorrow then,&quot; Holly said cheerfully. &quot;Bye.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;What did Fred want?&quot; Jeff asked quickly. <br />
			<br />

			<br />
			Holly read Jeff&#39;s impatient tone of voice and decided to let him stew for a bit. Instead of answering, she slowly and deliberately retrieved a beer from the fridge, then opened it and strolled leisurely back to the sofa. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Here you go, honey.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff knew the game. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Thanks, dear,&quot; he said graciously as he took the cold bottle. &quot;I assume Fred called about the party?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly smiled to herself. She had a knack for taming Jeff&#39;s impulsive actions.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Fred said that a lot of people are having trouble with costumes this year. Everyone wants to do something really special.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Really?&quot; Jeff asked, feigning bored surprise. The game was truly engaged; he had to appear indifferent to the news, even though his curiosity was gnawing at him.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yes,&quot; Holly answered, her voice deliberate and emotionless as she precisely metered out the information. &quot;The costumes last year were so good that everyone feels the bar has been raised for this year.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You don&#39;t say,&quot; Jeff tried to keep in the game. In fact, he was nearly ready to burst from curiosity.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yes. But Fred said he found something that could help.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff gave in. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, what did Fred find? And how&#39;s it going to help our costumes this year?&quot; he blurted; impatience and curiosity had beaten him once more.<br />
			<br />
			Holly smiled sweetly, her only display of her little victory. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Fred said he found some kind of magic box. He said it can change a person into whatever they think of.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; he snorted. <br />
			<br />

			<br />
			&quot;Hi, Jeff. Holly!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Fred, standing in his robe, seemed surprised to see his friends here at this late hour. Especially since he&#39;d just talked to Holly an hour ago.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff pushed past Fred. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, Fred,&quot; he demanded as he scanned Fred&#39;s apartment. &quot;Where&#39;s this so-called magic box?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred sighed, shrugging his shoulders for Holly to see his exasperation, then he let her inside and closed the door. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You could have at least called,&quot; he rebuked Jeff.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff ignored Fred&#39;s protest at the intrusion. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;So, where is it?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred shook his head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Always the non-believer,&quot; he clucked. &quot;Always the doubter.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Shaking his head, he led the two into his den.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff blinked when the light turned on, then he frowned. &quot;That&#39;s it? A gray telephone booth? _That&#39;s_ your magic box?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Fred shook his head again. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, smart guy. You don&#39;t believe it? Watch this.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He stepped to the side of the box, to a panel that looked like an LCD computer display above a red dinosaur paw print. He gave Jeff one final stern glance over his shoulder, then he touched the crystalline paw and began to concentrate on the display.<br />
			<br />
			As Jeff and Holly watched, the screen began to change. Slowly, a figure began to appear - fuzzy at first, then gaining in definition and clarity. Finally, when it looked very realistic, Fred dropped his hand from the red crystal and touched a doorknob-shaped purple crystal. <br />
			<br />
			Just like that, with no visible or audible clues, an opening appeared in the side of the box - as if by magic. Fred gave Jeff a smug look over his shoulder, then he stepped into the box. The opening vanished as instantly as it had appeared.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff glanced at Holly, his features reflecting his confusion. Things like this - a box with doors that just appeared and disappeared - weren&#39;t normal. As he glanced back at the strange box, the door reappeared. Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed as he craned his neck forward to see what was happening.<br />
			<br />
			Neither Jeff nor Holly expected to see what stepped out.<br />
			<br />
			MAU: The Ultimate Costume, part 5<br />
			added by ElrodW on 09/16/2016 20:12<br />
			<br />
			Neither Jeff nor Holly expected to see a alien creature step out. <br />
			<br />
			Jeff stared, while Holly let out a tiny scream. As Jeff&#39;s eyes widened, the creature stepped menacingly from the box, stalking them slowly. Just when they were backed against the wall with nowhere left to retreat, the creature tilted back its head and laughed. <br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s eyes widened. <br />
			<br />
			It was Fred&#39;s laugh.<br />
			<br />
			The creature pulled off its helmet, showing the unworldly visage, while Fred&#39;s laughter echoed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You should have seen your face,&quot; the creature chortled in Fred&#39;s voice. &quot;I got you good!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Fred?&quot; Jeff asked cautiously as the creature assumed a less menacing stance.<br />
			<br />
			The creature laughed again. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yup!&quot; Fred confirmed.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;That&#39;s some costume,&quot; Holly said cautiously as she eyed the creature.<br />
			<br />
			The creature went back to the controls, and after another few seconds in the box, Fred reemerged. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;It wasn&#39;t a costume,&quot; he explained to his confused friends. &quot;It _changed_ me - into the creature.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff shook his head even as he examined the box. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;That&#39;s not possible,&quot; he declared. <br />
			<br />
			Fred&#39;s features changed from amusement to annoyance; his lips pursed and his eyes narrowed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Always the skeptic, weren&#39;t you,&quot; he muttered with a hint of disgust in his voice.<br />
			<br />
			Holly elbowed Jeff. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;It looked pretty real to me,&quot; she chided her boyfriend.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff shook his head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah? He hides the costume in the box, then expects us to fall for the quick-change gag?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred glared at Jeff for a moment, then he sighed. <br />
			<br />
			MAU: The Ultimate Costume, part 6<br />
			added by ElrodW on 09/16/2016 20:18<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll do another one.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Fred spun back to the control pad, and after a moment&#39;s work, he again touched the purple knob. Once more, he stepped in, the door vanished, and then it reappeared. <br />
			<br />
			It wasn&#39;t an alien that emerged this time; rather, Fred&#39;s head popped through the door, obviously ducking a bit, then his nude torso appeared, followed seconds later by ... <br />
			<br />
			....the forelegs and torso of a horse!<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s jaw dropped once more. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Fred?&quot; he asked, incredulous, as an entire horse&#39;s body appeared. <br />
			<br />
			Fred was a centaur, with his own human torso atop the body of a horse. <br />
			<br />
			Holly glanced up and down, then back along the entire horse. Her mouth hung agape in disbelief. Then her eyes widened as she spied the horse&#39;s equipment, protruding huge and hard and red from the sheath beneath the horse&#39;s body. Her hand clasped over her mouth in a futile attempt to stifle the gasp of surprise. Quickly, with her face reddening, she turned quickly back toward Fred&#39;s head and face, away from the embarrassing sight.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Well?&quot; Fred asked Jeff, his face bearing a triumphant grin. &quot;You going to say I&#39;m faking this one, too?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff walked slowly around the centaur, closely examining what he believed to be a costume. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I don&#39;t know how you did it, but this is one fantastic trick,&quot; he mumbled.<br />
			<br />
			Fred frowned, then he reworked the box. In moments, he emerged as himself. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You just don&#39;t believe, do you?&quot; he asked angrily. &quot;I show you some ... fantastic ... alien contraption that can _make_ you into whatever costume you want, and you don&#39;t believe?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff shook his head warily. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Sorry, Fred, but no. You&#39;ve pulled some good ones on me, so you&#39;ll understand if I&#39;m a bit skeptical.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly elbowed Jeff in the ribs yet again. She just couldn&#39;t understand Jeff and Fred and their constant rivalry. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You have to admit that if it isn&#39;t real, it&#39;s a pretty good trick. And I don&#39;t see how it could be a trick.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred suddenly got a wicked grin. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, Mister Skeptic,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll prove to you that it&#39;s real.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He turned back toward the controls, and after a moment&#39;s manipulation, he touched the <br />
			purple knob again.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;What are you going to change into this time?&quot; Jeff asked sarcastically.<br />
			<br />
			MAU: The Ultimate Costume, part 7<br />
			added by ElrodW on 09/16/2016 20:26<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Not me,&quot; Fred answered with a smug smile. &quot;You.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He gestured to the opening, indicating that Jeff should enter the device.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s jaw dropped. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You ... want me ... to go in there?&quot; he stammered. His confidence that it was all a gag was evaporating quickly. And yet...<br />
			<br />
			Fred knew he had Jeff. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Just step in and touch the purple crystal thing. The rest is automatic.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff gulped. He was on the spot, and he knew it. But ... this had to be a trick. It had to be. There was no way Fred could have gotten a machine that actually _changed_ someone! He clenched his jaw and stepped into the box. He gave Fred a determined &#39;I&#39;ll show you&#39; glance, then he touched the purple crystal, just as Fred had indicated. The door vanished, just as it had before.<br />
			<br />
			The door opened, and Jeff staggered out .....<br />
			<br />
			MAU: The Ultimate Costume, part 8<br />
			added by ElrodW on 09/16/2016 20:33<br />
			<br />
			The door opened, and Jeff staggered out his blue eyes wide as saucers and his full red lips parted in surprise as his delicate hands cupped the large, no _enormous_, breasts hanging nude from his chest. Below the orbs, his waist was tiny, with wide round feminine hips completing the exaggerated hourglass figure he now had. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What ...&quot; his eyes widened even more at the sultry contralto voice emanating from his mouth, &quot;... what the hell have you done to me?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Convinced?&quot; Fred asked with a smug grin.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You ... you changed me into a ... &quot; <br />
			<br />
			A sudden thought entered Jeff&#39;s head, and with a panicked glance, he struggled to peer between his huge bosoms, a nearly impossible task given the size of the bosoms, while his hands dropped from his big erect nipples to the pink G-string bottom. He patted frantically, his eyes widening with each passing second as he realized that something was missing.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yes,&quot; Fred beamed. &quot;You&#39;re a woman. And not just any woman, but ... you remember that stripper at Dave&#39;s bachelor party? Bobbi Bazookas?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He reached out to tweak Jeff&#39;s nipple, causing Jeff to flinch and slap at Fred&#39;s hand. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Well, you&#39;re her now.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;But ... he&#39;s ... a girl?&quot; Holly finally managed to stammer. &quot;All the way?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred grinned. &quot;Yup.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He turned to Jeff. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You want to find out how well your new equipment works?&quot; he said with a leer as he reached for Jeff&#39;s mammaries yet again.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff backed away, against the box, as his eyes filled with terror. He knew what Fred was talking about, and that his body was far too tiny and weak to fight if Fred really did try something. Which, given the circumstances, Jeff wasn&#39;t sure if Fred would or would not! <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Get away from me!&quot; Jeff croaked as he swatted at Fred&#39;s groping hands.<br />
			<br />
			Fred stopped, then he turned to Holly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Of course, now that Jeff&#39;s a woman, I guess you&#39;ll be in the market for a boyfriend,&quot; he said playfully.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Turn me back,&quot; Jeff pleaded, trying hard not to sound sexy in the new ultra-sexy feminine voice he possessed. It was a near impossibility. <br />
			<br />
			Fred glanced at Jeff and wiggled his eyebrows Groucho style. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to try anything first?&quot; he said with yet another leer.<br />
			<br />

			added by ElrodW on 09/16/2016 20:47<br />
			<br />
			The suggestion fell flat. <br />
			<br />
			In a few moments, Fred showed Jeff how to work the controls, and after another cycle in the machine, Jeff was restored, complete to his clothing.<br />
			<br />
			As Jeff staggered from the box, patting himself none too modestly to make sure that everything that was supposed to be there was, and that anything that _wasn&#39;t_ supposed to be there wasn&#39;t. Jeff sat close to Holly, trying hard to look macho and brave, while he trembled inwardly. Being changed into the likeness of a big-boobed stripper by his old friend and rival had thoroughly rattled him.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So, are you ready to admit that it works?&quot; Fred gloated.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff glanced at Holly, then the two nodded. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I don&#39;t know how you did it, but yeah, it was real.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So what you&#39;re suggesting is that we ... use the box ... to make ourselves into something for the party. Not just wear a costume, but to change completely!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			The pieces clicked into place for Holly and Jeff about the same time; she beat him to the words.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yup,&quot; Fred nodded. &quot;A few of our friends are already planning to use it. Should be a great party this year.&quot;<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			&quot;You remember what Fred said - it reads your mind. So if I make the werewolf able to change at will, it should work.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Jeff sat on the couch, with Holly cuddled in his lap.<br />
			<br />
			After Fred’s initial demonstration, Jeff and Holly has since returned to their home to process what they saw and figure out what to do next. <br />
			<br />
			But that was yesterday night. It is now Halloween afternoon. A few hours before the upcoming Halloween party. And Jeff and Holly still haven’t decided on a costume. <br />
			<br />
			The box currently sits in their living room, on loan from Fred. Apparently, the box can be changed into a portable cube and changed back at any time. <br />
<br />
			For some reason, Fred refused to show himself when he handed them the cube from behind his front door.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah, but a werewolf?&quot; Holly sounded unsure. &quot;I thought it would be something we could _both_ go as. Maybe something cute.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Cute?&quot; Jeff&#39;s voice echoed his disbelief. &quot;Cute? This is Halloween!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah? Well Mary and Ron are going as military medics. And I heard Harry and Simone are going to be cute space aliens.&quot;<br />

			Jeff sighed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah, but I wanted something really different. Something ... unique.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You want?&quot; Holly asked with distaste in her voice. &quot;I want something ... together.&quot;<br />
