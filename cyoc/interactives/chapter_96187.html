<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After 1000 pisses, Chad was pretty much out of it. He was still orgasming, but barely recalled he was ever anything but a urinal cake.  As he finally, became small enough to fit through the plastic mesh and go down the drain, he could only feel disappointment that he would never enjoy the bliss of another man&#39;s piss again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn!&quot; said Keith, &quot;I forgot about Chad!&quot;  It was over a week now.  He rushed into the locker room toilet area and stared at the empty plastic mesh. He sighed.  He really had meant to turn Chad back, at least that&#39;s what he told himself.  Then he had an idea.  The kind of idea worthy of an unreformed Grinch. It was a truly, evil, awful idea.  He collect some items from his locker and headed to the sewage treatment plant.  His uncle worked there, so he knew he could get in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m here to see Arthur Stevens,&quot; Keith said to the guard, &quot;I&#39;m his nephew Keith.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guard phoned him, and then gave Keith a guest name badge.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Keith, what brings you here?&quot; Uncle Arthur asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you kept saying that you wanted to give me a tour of the plant, and I finally decided why not!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so you&#39;re thinking about civil engineering then,&quot; Arthur said, &quot;Great field.  Infrastructure literally is the backbone of our society.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
When they were at the huge collection pools, Keith asked, &quot;So is all the stuff that we flushed down the toilet in the last week in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, more likely everything people flushed in the last month is in here.  There are filters that let the water pass through but the larger particles are trapped in the pools and we add chemicals to begin the process of purifying them before releasing into the lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The last three weeks?  Would that include my piss from the High School locker room yesterday afternoon?&quot; Keith asked excitedly.<br />
<br />
Arthur smiled, and replied, &quot;Most probably, it is.  It takes 6-8 hours for most of the sewage to reach the plant.  Occasionally, there is a stoppage, but I imagine if the line from the high school was blocked, I&#39;d have heard about it by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s quite a feat of engineering, Uncle Arthur,&quot; Keith said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not state of the art.  Modern sewage plants are much faster and more automated than we are.  See those barrels over there?  They contain the enzymes, acids and bases we use to treat the sewage. We have to pour them in manually.  You know we are going to be building a new sewage treatment plant in about 5 years.  Would you like to see the plans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be great, Uncle Arthur.  I&#39;ll wait here, while you get them, and then you can point out the differences between the plans and what is here now,&quot; Keith said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I really am not supposed to leave visitors unattended, Keith,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, I won&#39;t touch anything.  I just find this whole place fascinating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, alright, but be careful, the pools are highly toxic now,&quot; Arthur said checking his watch, &quot;Besides there shouldn&#39;t be anyone down here for at least two hours when the guard patrols, and the treatment men are here only 4 hours each morning. I&#39;ll be back in 5 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Unc,&quot; Keith said waving until his uncle was out of sight.  Then he opened his backpack.  He took out 3 black candles, a scroll and a black leather pouch.  He opened his shirt to display an amulet. Then he stood and looked around. <br />
<br />
Reassured that he was alone, Keith drew a circle with chalk around himself on the floor next to the holding pools. Then holding up his amulet, he said loudly, &quot;Essence of Chad, hear my voice and coalesce from these waters!&quot; He threw the powdery contents of the pouch into the nearest pool. The water bubbled and the powder on the surface glowed. Keith unrolled the scroll and incanted, &quot;Essence of Chad, Essence of Chad, Essence of Chad, By the power of Isis, By the power of Osiris, I call upon the waters of the Nile,&quot; he paused and added, &quot;And the sewage treatment plant to release the essence of Chad, and give the essence a new form. I summon you Chad, in the name of Anubis, In the name of Bast, in the name of Ra, in the name of Amon, in the name of Osiris, in the name of Isis, take form again, and rise forth from the waters. I command it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The powder on the surface was glowing vibrantly now.  Water sloshed with its nasty contents from neighboring pools. The effluent seemed to ungulate across the concrete and flowed into the pool where the powder glowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Keith whispered, &quot;it&#39;s working.&quot; Slowly, the waters sloshed and gave up their bits of Chad. All ooze flowed to the glowing powder.<br />
<br />
He stole a glance at his watch, it had been three minutes since his uncle left, he would have a lot of explaining to do, if his uncle got back in the next two minutes.<br />
<br />
Keith took out his phone and dialed the main line of the sewage plant, &quot;Hello,&quot; he said in a high pitched nasal voice, &quot;This is Jessica from the Mayor&#39;s office.  Can you please connect this call from the mayor to -uh, Arthur Stevens.  Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arthur had grabbed some blue prints, a rendering, and his laptop to show Arthur, when the phone rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said testily, &quot;I am in the middle-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Mayor&#39;s on line one for you, Mr. Stevens,&quot; said the receptionist.<br />
<br />
&quot;The mayor?  Oh, it must be about the new plant!  Well, connect him already,&quot; he said anxiously putting down his plans, paperwork and computer. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s on line one, I&quot;m on the intercom. Just push the flashing button.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, thanks,&quot; and he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Mayor, this is an honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith in his Jessica voice said, &quot;Please hold, Mr. Stevens. The mayor will be with you shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it about the new plant?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith winced, maybe he should have looked at the plans first. He shrugged, and said in the high pitched nasal voice, &quot;I suppose.  A lot of environmentalists were here earlier complaining about the site.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? But the site is the old oil refinery, we&#39;ll clean up all the toxic stuff and build the plant there.  It will cleanup the pollution, how can the environmentalists oppose that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven decided to play dumb blonde, &quot;I do not know, sir.  I am only the receptionist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t sound like Carol?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the temp receptionist, Jessica,&quot; lied Keith. He could make out large lumps gathering under the powder. That sort of looked like a head, and shoulders and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I hope Carol&#39;s well,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know, sir.  You can ask the mayor when I he picks up. I have to take another call now, sir.  Please hold.&quot;  Keith put his cellphone on hold, turned off the screen and shoved it in his pocket.<br />
<br />
After five minutes on hold, Arthur stepped out of his office while stretching the phone cord, and flagged down a guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mistuh Stevens?&quot; the guard said, &quot;You got a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Jamal, I need you to go collect my nephew.  I was giving him a tour, and left him by the holding pools, so I could get something from my office, and then the mayor called, and he has me on hold. Been on hold for over five minutes.  I&#39;m sure Keith is wondering what happened to me.  Could you go down and check on him for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistuh Stevens, you know visitors aren&#39;t sposed to be left unescorted in the plant!&quot; lectured Jamal.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was only supposed to be a minute or two, but duty calls and so does the mayor. Keith is thinking about going into civil engineering like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Jamal knowingly. &quot;I&#39;ll go check on him, and tell him you will be along right quickly as you get off the phone with the mayor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Jamal,&quot; he said stepping back into his office. <br />
<br />
About two minutes later, the intercom buzzed, &quot;Mayor line two, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought he was on line one, I&#39;ve been holding!&quot; Arthur said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps they got disconnected and called back?&quot; said the receptionist.<br />
<br />
He hung up line one, and picked up line two.  He said, &quot;Hello, Mr. Mayor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s Carol, the mayor will be with you shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carol?  But when Jessica called earlier, she said you were out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica? We don&#39;t have any Jessica&#39;s at the mayor&#39;s office,&quot; Carol said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she said that was her name when she called here about seven minutes ago.  I was holding for the mayor, when you called.  She said she was the temp receptionist filling in for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you were pranked, Mr. Stevens.  Oh, wait, it might have been one of those college interns, Jennifer, I thought her name was.  Today was their last day.  Kids these days. Oh, never mind that now. The mayor&#39;s ready to speak with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Art,&quot; said the mayor coming on the line, &quot;I wanted to talk with you about the new sewage treatment facility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s about the environmentalists, I think our Environmental Impact Report speaks for itself. It will clean up a polluted site, and more-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Art.  What environmentalists?  I think all of them are on board.  No, I was calling about capacity. The neighboring towns were wondering about going in with us on the plant.  Could it handle the sewage from Coolidge and Eastgate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would need to review their lines, sir, but I think with the addition of some pumps, we could get the sewage uphill from Eastgate.  Might need to add 3 or 4 holding tanks?  Maybe more.  I heard a developer was talking about adding 1000 houses to Coolidge, is that still the case?&quot;  Arthur unrolled his plans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back by the sewage pools, the essence appears to have coalesced. Keith&#39;s phone vibrates to indicate the connection has been lost.  Keith raises his right hand and reads the scroll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come forth, Chad Reborn!  As Osiris of Ages Past, Arise from the murky waters! Come forth, Chad, now!&quot;</p>
