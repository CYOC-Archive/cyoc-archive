<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Paul's eyes went wide, realizing that the drink must have done more to him than adding his actually dark brown hair, that looked black, onto his body. Thinking about how he must have looked then, having started to relax and enjoying all the suddenly new feelings, Paul made a huge smile. In doing so, Paul realized that the flesh on his face didn't seem right, it was more taut than normal. Feeling his face with his hand, he noticed two things. One was the fact that his hands were thicker and meatier than he had ever remembered them being while his fingernails were longer and coming to a point like... claws. The second thing that he noticed upon feeling his face, it was protruding slightly, forming a bit of a mini muzzle. Paul wanted to see himself in the mirror now, more than ever, just to get a look at the new and partially improved him.</Br>
<Br>Having noticed Paul's new relaxed attitude, he smiled and Brandon was at the same stage of his transformation. Brandon, however, moved to the side while lustfully stroking Paul's more muscular and thick hair covered forearm. The playful touch sent shivers through Paul's changing body, which made him want Brandon even more. Looking at his face, Paul actually got a kick out of what was happening to him and everyone else there. As Paul gazed upon himself, he saw a bit more than his hands could tell him. His eyes were a luminous hue of amber, his face was indeed the beginnings of a snout while two fangs protruded from the sealing of his lips. Opening his mouth, he saw that his incisors had stopped growing for now and they were even longer and sharper while being very pointed to help sink his teeth into some of the toughest flesh types. When Paul started to fully comprehend what was happening to him, he smiled again, finding his nose flattening out to form more of a lupine snout.</Br>
<Br>"So what do you think of the newer you?"</Br>
<Br>"I... I don't know... I'm in a bit of a shock right now!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah you first timers always say that! Seriously though... how do you like the new you, me and everyone else in here?"</Br>
<Br>"I... I don't... awe fuck it. I am a god damn werewolf and I fucking love it. I've always been a scared little pussy, afraid of being gay and who I really am, but no longer. I am a gay, cock sucking, cum guzzling, masculine werewolf and fucking proud of it... AAAAWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"</Br>
<Br>"Alright brother! Welcome to the pack and you better get ready because more of the the moon will be up and out shortly, bringing us closer to our full forms!" Brandon said exuberantly while pointing back up at the skylight.</Br>
<Br>Looking up at the glass, Paul could see more light flooding into the room, making him feel more aggressive and pushing his body to new heights than ever before. Paul looked to Brandon and the mirror to watch more of his own and Brandon's transformations. As a euphoric feeling swept over them, their mini muzzles pushed completely out forming into lupine muzzles, with moist black noses. Their ears grew longer and formed into a pair of triangular ears on the upper sides of their heads. Then the feeling lowered again, allowing Paul to see and enjoy what he was becoming.</Br>
<Br>Speaking in a more guttural and animalistic voice Brandon started speaking. "Well Paul, what do you have to say now about your new more lupine self?"</Br>
<Br>"Nothing other than the fact that I think you are one of the fuckin' hottest werewolf in this bar and I can't wait to get this muzzle on your fat cock, especially since deep-throating wont be an issue."</Br>
<Br>Brandon grinned his wolfish grin. "Well, if you liked what has happened so far, then you are going to love this!"</Br>
<Br>Brandon hopped clean over the bar and stood massive unclothed and muscular wolven chest to clothed and muscular wolven chest. He then rose his paw up and sliced through all of Paul's clothes in one fall slash, leaving his once straining clothes in tatters on the floor. Brandon did the same to himself, exposing his large meat for Paul to see.</Br>
<Br>Brandon immediately caught Paul's eyes looking at his package. "Oh... well it looks like you have found something you really like eh?"</Br>
<Br>Paul nodded, noticing that they were both completely flaccid even though they were both hornier than ever. Brandon reached out and firmly cupped Paul's equipment in his paws, playfully toying around with Paul's sack. "I know what you are wondering. You're curious why neither one of us has a raging hard-on when we really should be dripping pre from a rock solid boner... right?"</Br>
<Br>Paul just nodded, lost in erotic euphoria with what Brandon kept doing. "Well... as soon as that moon is all the way up, which it should be in another few seconds, you will see why."</Br>
<Br>As soon as Brandon finished, the full amount of light from the moon poured in the room and as it did, an extremely erotic wave of pleasure swept over everyone. What Paul hadn't noticed was that this entire time fur was slowly growing all over his and Brandon's body. Feeling the erotic wave, Paul couldn't help moaning along with Brandon. As the feeling kept intensifying, Paul noticed that he and Brandon were starting to rise. As Paul watched, Brandon's cock got growing longer and thicker than Paul had ever dreamed. Just when he thought his own cock was done growing to it's usual size, to his own surprise his cock and balls grew bigger and fatter. When he was done growing, he had a full hard cock of seven and a half inches long and as thick as a forty ounce beer bottle. To his own surprise, without even noticing it, his balls had grown to the size of a baseball each and a large fluffy tail was bushing up against his fur covered back.</Br>
<Br>Paul looked around to the other wolves in the room, noticing that they were all drooling over him and Brandon. Paul also noticed that he and Brandon had the thickest cocks there, while all the others were impressive they were no where near what he and Brandon had. In fact, staring at Brandon's cock, Paul realized that Brandon had a slight amount of more girth than him.</Br>
<Br>"So... I take it you are not disappointed?" He grinned as he made his cock bob while dripping wet with precum.</Br>
<Br>"Nope, not at all..."</Br></p>
