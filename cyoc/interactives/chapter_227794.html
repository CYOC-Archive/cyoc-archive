<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris’s body wasn’t under his control as this rather beautiful women with impossible blue hair, a killer body was standing nude before him. Her breasts had to be somewhere between C and small Ds but given her frame it was perfect size. Her skin was silky smooth, and she seemed to have stepped out of some kind of sexual fantasy. That would have been weird enough, not many or any beautiful women like that would stand nude before a homeless man who last showed two weeks ago. However, the really strange thing was that coming gracefully from her back was a pair of butterfly like wings in a mix of different shades of blue, her ears where also pointed. She was even hovering a bit off the ground, so her breasts were eye level with his larger frame.<br />
<br />
“You have done well protecting me, from those men.” said the women…no fairy, how did he know that she was a real fairy, did that kiss she gave him do something to him. She looked past him toward the two rich businessmen type who had attempted to sexually assault her at best only a few moments ago. “They will get what is coming to them in time, but first your reward.”<br />
<br />
She bent down again and kissed him full on the lips, a shiver unlike anything he had ever experienced before ran up his spin. It wasn’t unpleasant, in truth it was possible the best kiss he had ever gotten. He let out a moan in pleasure and to his slight amazement so did this beautiful fairy before him. No…her name was Gloria, Queen of the Fairy and Goddess of all fairy folk. How did he know that, was the information downloaded into his brain or something. <br />
<br />
One of her hands moved to the stump of an arm he had. He had lost that arm in the army on some unnamed desert road in some backwater sand trap. <br />
<br />
“You are a warrior, good.” said Gloria her voice soft and musical “I am in need or warriors and lovers, I claim you as my personal guard and my first husband and lover.”<br />
<br />
Chris had no idea what that really meant, then Gloria’s hand began to glow, the hand on his stump and to his amazement, he was able to watch as the hand he had lost was regrowing. It didn’t hurt, in fact it felt better than the kiss and it brought tears of joy to his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Well I had to make you whole, now to make you the first of my subjects.” said Gloria “We will use the old ways since I claim you as my guard and 1st husband.”<br />
<br />
That still confused Chris, then as if some new information appeared on a pop-up screen on a computer he understood.<br />
<br />
Fairys could be married to only a single person but the most common was a sort of poly relationship. Each fairy could have as many lovers as they want, be it female or male and their partner could have as many lovers as they want. 1st husband, 2nd wife, 7th wife and 9th husband was totally reasonable and only meant their place in the order of that fairy’s lovers however most stayed between 4 and 5 lovers. Some lovers would be demoted if they de please their spouse but the relationship could be broken off at any time. To be the 1st husband to the goddess and ruler was a great honor.<br />
<br />
“Now…please your goddess and become my subject.” Ordered Gloria as Chris seemed to move forward, he was semi in control, it was as if he was ordered to please her but the method was his choice.<br />
<br />
He stood up a bit and began to kiss his goddess around the collar bone while one of his hands went down to her women hood or fairyhood he didn’t know. While the hand she had blessed him with began to play with her breasts. <br />
<br />
He got more then a few moans from her, which caused him much joy as be went down on one knee and began to suckle on her breasts before kissing down her belly to her slit. He began to pleasure her with his mouth earning moans from her. He didn’t even notice that her hands were glowing and his entire body was covered with energy. His ears became pointed, his muscles became stronger than the day he left boot camp which was when he was in the best shape of his life. Even his manhood was bigger, his clothing was burned away to make room as two large wings grow from his back.<br />
<br />
They were more silver and black then his goddess’s own blue and while her’s were rounded like butterfly wings his where sharper and more pointed. <br />
<br />
“Good.” Said Gloria in a breathless moan “Arise, you are the first of many and my new lover.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, my Goddess, I swear to follow you and to obey any orders from you be it on the battlefield or the bedchamber.” Answered Chris as he stood up, he was still taller then Gloria but he had actually shrunk. That confused him for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Fairies can change their size, once we make my palace we will become our true height.” Stated Gloria “In the mean time, we have these two to deal with.”<br />
<br />
“What will you have of them?” inquired Chris looking at the two shell shocked men still stuck to the wall. &quot;They dared to attack you.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Yes, they did. I don&#39;t think they would if they knew who I was, but they would have attacked someone else which is a crime in our world just like in the human world. We do not imprison, we transform and make them serve as slaves until their punishment is done...if ever” started Gloria as she eyed them. &quot;I will no proclaim your punishment.&quot;</p>
