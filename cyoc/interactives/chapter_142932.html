<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   Markus went through the global options and checked the traits of his species in general, having one of his more twisted fantasies in mind...why not see if he could manage it? Creating catgirls would be pretty hot, after all, even if he wasn&#39;t proud of it. He thought about it for a short while and settled on just women, as having both felt like it&#39;d belittle the concept, and went to work changing the traits of all females on Earth. The ears, and tails...but all the important parts left as they were. A little further out there, he decided to change the way they mate to be more...attached. Women, the new catgirl women, would be more of a lifemate kind of situation than simple sexual partners. Instinctual monogamy, if you will. He also made it so that they&#39;d be very submissive...yeah, he definitely had a bit of a power issue too. But he knew this, why else would he be changing the whole world to the image he wants? Fuck &#39;em. He slammed the enter key and sat back, looking around. <br />
<br />
   His life didn&#39;t change much, nothing really altering at all in his immediate sight. He quickly looked up images of women and noticed they all had the characteristics he had entered...though not all of them were as attractive as he&#39;d hoped. Not everyone looked so attractive as a cat, he figured. Why not change that? Back to his computer he went, making sure the characteristics also made sure all the catgirls were at least acceptably attractive. A matter of opinion, he realized, but his opinion may as well be law right now. He hit the enter key again and looked at the page, smiling as he saw the abundance of attractive catlike women who now filled the world. Immediately, his cock was hard, and he just smiled down at it..whispering &quot;Soon, my friend. Very soon.&quot; as he stood to go and see the world beyond. He left his house faster than lightning, the last person he wanted to see as an attractive catgirl was his mother, and was greeted with an immediate change. Most people didn&#39;t consider this, but what if all the women in the world were submissive and attractive? Not necessarily a good thing. As he looked around, he noticed his semi urban street packed much further than it was before. As a flush of new memories entered his mind, he realized what he&#39;d done to it&#39;s fullest extent. There were a lot more people in the world...<br />
<br />
   In a weird, almost misogynistic &quot;utopia&quot; like this, the submissive women catgirls that now inhabited the world had never stopped being bought, sold, and traded. Nor had the idea of men having a single partner ever taken hold, as he&#39;d only set the women to that sort of lifemate concept. It was common for men in this world to have multiple wives, and it wasn&#39;t uncommon for them to have handfuls of children in one household. As his two lives clashed together, it boggled his mind how drastically such a change could make the world, but that was just what he&#39;d wanted, after all. He walked down the street, looking around at the people as he passed by. Men walked their catgirl women on collars down the street, sometimes more than one at a time. Knowing he had caused this, he felt terrible, but a part of him was undeniably turned on. Plus, wasn&#39;t this technically reality now? And if they&#39;re submissive, aren&#39;t they alright with it? He shook his head, figuring the time for moral dilemma had long past, and wondered how he&#39;d go about trying this new life for himself. After all, if he was really that upset about it, he could change it back later. <br />
<br />
   Continuing down the street, he stopped in the park. He watched the mothers play with their children, something distinctly catlike about the way they did it, often pouncing on them and every now and then shaking their asses in the air before doing so. He laughed at that pretty hard, knowing it was probably purely instinctual to them now. He couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the pure embarrassment of it they&#39;d have had if they knew, though. He let his eyes wander across the park more, the kid weren&#39;t left untouched. Little girls ran around with little cat ears on their head, and tails waving behind them. Cute, innocent, guess that didn&#39;t change, did it? He looked further across the part and noticed a girl sitting on a bench. No collar...no man with her, so that must mean she&#39;s available. Her long blonde hair, matching color on the fur of her ears and her tail...and beautiful green eyes. If he didn&#39;t know better, he&#39;d have created this girl from his own imagination. Normally, he&#39;d be way too nervous to approach her, but he had the literal power to change whatever he wanted at his fingertips, so what did it really matter? He approached her and sat down at the other side of her bench, leaning back and looking at her. She just looked back, confused and probably a little nervous all things considered. Markus thought for a moment, coming up with the perfect line as he said &quot;Sorry, I just saw you across the park and had to come say hi, but....well, I&#39;m afraid the cat&#39;s got my tongue.&quot; <br />
<br />
   She just looked at him, narrowing her eyes a little, her tail flicking as she gave a little exhale. &quot;You know that&#39;s literally the oldest line in the book, right?&quot; She answered, still looking at him with a little disdain, maybe a little more from the crappy line. He could sense a little bit of interest below the surface, though. Maybe it was just him, who knows? He smiled back at her either way, nodding with a sigh as he said &quot;Yeah, I know it is, but I couldn&#39;t help it. If I don&#39;t make a joke, I&#39;m just gonna say something that makes me sound like an idiot.&quot; She just raised an eyebrow, smiling back a little. &quot;You already sound like an idiot, so at least you were up front with who you are, yeah?&quot; Markus just grinned for a moment, giving a stammered &quot;Y-Yeah....&quot; and a sigh, scratching his head as he thought how much of an idiot he was being. Guess even the Chronivac can&#39;t change that, huh? Part of him wondered whether he shouldn&#39;t just move on to someone else, maybe be less of an idiot?</p>
