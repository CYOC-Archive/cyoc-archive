<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once everything was done downstairs for the evening, William and Martha Anderson went up to the master bedroom of their home.<br />
There, Martha couldn&#39;t wait to totally strip and assume her fursona.<br />
She had grown to love changing forms almost as much as having sex in either one. The feeling of fur growing all across her body as her features altered from pure human to an anthropomorphic form as she released her inner werecat made Martha purr with excitement and thoughts of what might lie ahead.<br />
As she grabbed her favorite hairbrush off her dresser and sat on the edge of the bed to start combing out her tail, Martha noticed her husband.<br />
Although he had kicked off his shoes and socks for the night, William had yet to strip, let alone assume his fursona.<br />
While he hadn&#39;t entered were society under the best of circumstances, Martha thought her husband made one sexy werefox. He was the only man she loved, and since acknowledging her bi nature before becoming a werecat, Martha also realized that William Anderson would also be the only man of any species that she would willingly have sex with.<br />
Together, the two of them had already created and were raising two fine young sons. Someday there&#39;d be more children, especially since Martha longed for a daughter too, and with a were&#39;s extended lifespan, the final ticks of her biological clock were now a couple of centuries away for the thirty-something woman.<br />
Yet there were more pressing matters about their existing offspring she needed to discuss with her mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;William,&quot; began Martha.<br />
&quot;Yes dear?&quot; he said, but not turning to face her. He was staring at the collection of clothes through the open door of his closet. Although only in casual attire today, William had to be more meticulous concerning his professional attire as a college professor, and was trying to decide what to wear to Moon Lake College tomorrow.<br />
&quot;Do you think we need to talk to Eric?&quot;<br />
That got his attention. &quot;About what?&quot; he asked, while turning to face her.<br />
&quot;Well...,&quot; said Martha, while setting the hairbrush down. &quot;He&#39;s only 14, and already talking about settling down and raising a family with Julie Stovall.&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot; asked William, not seeing the problem, before turning back to his closet to pick out tomorrow&#39;s outfit.<br />
&quot;Do you think 14 is the right age to already be thinking about marriage, let alone having children?&quot;<br />
Hearing the concern in his wife&#39;s voice, William grabbed his choices for tomorrow, hung them on the closet door knob, and then went over to sit down next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we were still back in Minnesota, let alone still normal human beings, I would definitely say no. But here...&quot; and then William assumed his fursona.<br />
Not wearing anything from Awareness, the specialty clothing store that catered exclusively to weres, William felt his clothes grow a bit tight as he undid his belt and removed his pants and underwear to release his vulpine tail from confinement.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s different rules here,&quot; pointed out William, removing his shirt. While he too felt a thrill changing forms, at the moment William was just glad to no longer have anything restricting against his fur.<br />
&quot;Things are different here. We&#39;re different,&quot; William added, before taking Martha&#39;s paw in his. &quot;For a long time, we&#39;ve hoped Eric would come out of his shell. Overcome his shyness and be more of a... regular person, for lack of a better term, instead of being so reserved. Now that he has, is it wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; admitted Martha. &quot;Julie&#39;s a good person, and so are her folks. It&#39;s just that...&quot; and then she paused, trying to find the right words before continuing. &quot;It&#39;s just that, while I&#39;m happy Eric&#39;s so confident now, I&#39;m worried that somewhere down the line one or both of them might slip up somehow. That maybe Julie forgets her were-mermaid birth control pill one day and gets pregnant before they graduate high school, or that they can&#39;t wait to turn 18 and elope before they&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
William thought about it for a moment, and then agreed, &quot;Those are legitimate concerns. Then again, the way Julie and Eric keep talking about their future, let alone Eric Junior and Melinda—or whatever the daughter&#39;s name is supposed to be—they&#39;re already way ahead of you worrying about making a mistake and altering how things will be. Besides, the kids don&#39;t start arriving until their parents graduate college and have their professional careers under way. Remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;But how can they be so sure of something that hasn&#39;t even happened yet?&quot; asked Martha in return.<br />
&quot;Those prophecy dreams both claimed to have had, although I will concede it&#39;s unique that both Eric and Julie have had the <i>exact</i> same dreams,&quot; admitted William. &quot;Yet I&#39;ve noticed you don&#39;t appear worried about Nate and Alex as much as you are them. After all, they&#39;ve shared the same prophecy dreams about their own future too.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s different,&quot; replied Martha.<br />
&quot;Oh? How?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nate and his boyfriend are older, and have less of a wait before turning 18 and graduating high school.&quot;<br />
&quot;True, but the two of them are just as confident in their beliefs,&quot; pointed out her husband. &quot;They&#39;ll get married, graduate college and start their respective careers before adopting some needy were child named Alice.&quot;<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t know what to tell you. Even if we do have more children in the future, Eric will always be my baby,&quot; conceded Martha.<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s a mother&#39;s right to worry about her kids,&quot; realized William.<br />
<br />
The two of them sat there on the edge of the bed together, each lost in thought.<br />
Then William pulled Martha closer to him and said, &quot;Okay. If it will help ease your mind, we&#39;ll talk to Eric about the importance of patience, but that&#39;s the only topic I can see that needs to be discussed. Agreed?&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Martha, laying her head on his furry shoulder. &quot;I know we&#39;ve discussed this before, but have you had any prophecy dreams?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve dreamed of the future at times,&quot; admitted William. &quot;Me and you together well into our old age. A time in the future where all our children and grandchildren are gathered together in the backyard for a family picnic. I even dreamed once of testifying on Nate and Alex&#39;s behalf to see if they qualified to adopt whoever this Alice is too. But I can&#39;t say whether or not those were anything more than normal dreams of the subconscious when I was asleep.&quot;<br />
&quot;You never saw Alice?&quot; wondered Martha.<br />
&quot;Not to my recollection. In my dreams, Eric and Julie&#39;s children both had blonde hair like their mother. Then again, considering how strongly they&#39;ve talked about them in the past...&quot; Then William asked &quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve dreamed a couple of times about what it would be like to be a grandmother,&quot; admitted Martha, &quot;although I can&#39;t recall anything as specific as you have. But I did have one dream about our future.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you think about the name Wilma?&quot;<br />
&quot;As in Flintstone?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t recall ever meeting or knowing a Wilma. Why?&quot; wondered William.<br />
&quot;Maybe someday...&quot; was all his wife would say, before reaching down between her husband&#39;s legs and caressing his sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You little vixen you,&quot; said William, as he began to nuzzle her neck.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; corrected Martha, as his werefox member began to expand from its natural home. &quot;I&#39;m the sultry werecat that loves you. Although, if Joyce Carlson or any other vixen wants a threesome with us...&quot;<br />
&quot;The same with any of your werecat ladies, or any other hot and horny women you know,&quot; said William, before placing a paw between Martha&#39;s legs and caressing her inner thighs.<br />
Soon the two of them began kissing, well on their way to enjoying another wonderful session of physically expressing their love for each other.<br />
<br />
