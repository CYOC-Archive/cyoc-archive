<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Where is everyone else?” asked Terry as he looked at his now mermaid mother as both of them floated near one of the massive windows on the CDC transport tank which was now moving down a darkened highway. “Where is Dad, Kasey?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Answered his mother “I was separated from them when I started to show signs of transformation when we where on the phone with you.”<br />
<br />
“What happened?” inquired Jack as the his now mermaid best friend floated beside him.<br />
<br />
Flashback<br />
<br />
“Mrs. Melody Mormon.” Said a Doctor in bright orange full biohazard suit which made him look like some astronaut.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Said Melody as she sat on a beach chair, but she wasn’t relaxing in anyway. “Do you know where my son is? He became a mermaid? What about the rest of my family?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know about your son and the rest of your family is being processed, if they are infected they will be joining you in time but at the moment you are our focus.” Said the doctor in a half board, half tired voice. “Now please remove all clothing and get into the containment tank, this will…”<br />
<br />
“WHAT!!!” yelled Melody as she covered herself even though she still had her cloths on. She was what she considered average for a woman nearer to 50 then to 40, her short brown hair went to about her shoulder blades well that brown hair was now a bright orange color which was the sign to everyone that she had the mermaid virus. She was on the thin side which came from a lot of hard work, but she weighed more then she would have liked. Her breasts where slagging a bit from a mixture of age and breast feeding but was still an average B cup. She was confident enough to wear a bikini to this park but she wasn’t about to strip.<br />
<br />
“Mrs. Mormon, when you transform your cloths generally rip off but there are cases where they can cause life threatening danger when fabric gets merged into a new body.” Stated the doctor “You will be in a containment pod and no offense, with everything going on no one cares about nudity right now.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Stated Melody as she looked around, there was a lot of stuff going on. A lot of screams and shoats, lots of people yelling orders and doctors and soldiers/police giving orders. “Can I at least keep a top for when everything is done.”<br />
<br />
“You can take it with you but remove it while you are transforming.” Stated the doctor as with tears Melody was lead behind a currant to see a large tube which reminded her as a coffin. She began to strip before lowering herself into the tank making sure the purple bikini she had worn to the park was beside her. <br />
<br />
The tank closed and she was alone, with the only view on the outside word being three small windows by her head. They moved her tank right away and then let her sit there.<br />
<br />
It was a lonely and scary time for Melody as she thought about her family and what fate was before her. <br />
<br />
What she didn’t know and what the doctor had failed to say was that merpeople are hypersexual beings and having sex or sexual activity speeds up the transformation. Also that the virus in some people turn them on.<br />
<br />
The water in the tank which went up about halfway her sides as she lied down felt so good now, Melody felt like she was in the bath enjoying a long soak as she closed her eyes and let her mind take her away. It focused on her husband doing stuff to her in the bedroom as she fantasizes about him.<br />
<br />
One of her hands moved to one of her breasts while the other moved to her womanhood. <br />
<br />
She was so lost in her fantasy that she didn’t notice that over the course of only a few minutes she lost almost a decade worth of age. Her body changed as well, her frame growing a bit, however the biggest change was in her chest. She let out a full load moan, load enough that she would have been embarrassed but she didn’t care. Her breasts where pushing outwards against her own hands and it felt so good. She always wished she had a bigger chest, her husband never complained but she knew he liked bigger breasted women. Her breast kept growing and growing, even as they became perker before finally stopping at what she believed to be G sized. <br />
<br />
She paused for a moment to look down and actually smiled, her brain already becoming more mermaid then human. Her mind filled with what her husband would think of her new girls and how much fun they would have. She then noticed movement coming up from below, her smile grew wider as she saw some flesh colored octopus like limb, somehow she knew they belonged to her. While lost in pleasure, legs from the knees up had fused together while her legs from the knees down had split apart and lengthened into long limbs. While she would never swim as fast as a mermaid with a true tail, each of her new limbs had almost the same movement capabilities as her hand. <br />
<br />
“Time for some real fun.” purred Melody as one of her new 8 limbs moved to take her in her womanhood, while two others moved up to play with her breasts. Her arms moved behind her head as she went to town on herself. It felt so good, so right, she was going to enjoy being a mermaid, hopefully her husband got infected so she could be with him…or her, that would be fun also.<br />
<br />
End Flashback<br />
<br />
Terry looked at his mother, horrified.<br />
<br />
“And that is how I became a mermaid.” Said his mother<br />
<br />
“Mom…that is sick, I didn’t need to know any of that.” Countered Terry<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it.” Advised his mother “I mean you are a beautiful mermaid and once I finish with your hair.”<br />
<br />
“My hair?” inquired Terry as he noticed that while they where talking, a few of his mother’s octopus like legs where taking his new long silver white mermaid hair and was braiding it into a pony tail. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I am a stylist after all and your hair was begging to be worked.” Stated his mother “You need to embrace what you have become, it is far more enjoyable to do so.”<br />
<br />
“Can you do something with mine next?” inquired Jack as Terry realized that both his best friend and his mother had embraced their new bodies.<br />
<br />
“Sure, not a problem.” Added Mrs. Mormon</p>
