<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Keep your ideas to yourself.&quot; Heather reprimanded. &quot;I&#39;m going to look at some of these other statues and start cataloging things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Melissa sighed. She was kinda let down from being rejected for the second time. The thing was that she had just gotten so turned on when her new tits had grown in and could really use some release. She had hoped that Heather had also gotten a little hot and bothered by her own addition, and changed her mind. Apparently that didn&#39;t happen.<br />
<br />
However, Melissa had an idea. Maybe Heather just needed a more sensitive part of her anatomy transformed. All she had to do was bump her into another statue. Just a touch of the statue should be enough to set off more changes.<br />
<br />
With that plan in mind Melissa began walking towards Heather looking around for any &#39;interesting&#39; statues. As Melissa got closer, she finally spied one behind the intellectual blonde. The statue looked like a normal woman except for six thick tentacles growing out from around her vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.&quot; Melissa whispered to herself. She was just close enough to push her companion when Heather suddenly stood up. The unpredicted movement caused Melissa to flinch, shoving Heather in a different direction than she planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Heather grunted as she fell into another statue. &quot;What&#39;s the big idea?&quot; But both knew it was too late for an explanation.<br />
<br />
They both looked up at the statue Heather had landed on. It was about the same size as the rest but it&#39;s legs were in a digitigrade position, they only had three toes and all were tipped with long claws. It also had a long tail that was thick with muscle and came straight out, almost parallel with the ground.  Neither could see any fur on the statue and Melissa got the feeling that the lower half was based on a large predatory reptile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Heather gasped as the statue&#39;s eyes lit up a brilliant blue. Heather&#39;s lower body began to shake and twitch. She sat in horror staring at strange lumps and bumps that were moving under her pants. Finally, the pain hit her and she screamed, shutting her eyes tight.<br />
<br />
She felt her feet and ankles snap, shifting to new positions. her toes went numb and she knew they would burst out of her boots at any moment. There was also a foreign feeling of something above her ass pulling and stretching at her skin. As she lay there she could feel her muscles growing in her legs. The power growing in her legs was more than she&#39;d ever had before. She felt strong enough to lift a bus.<br />
<br />
The solid hiking boots she was wearing gave way to her expanding feet with a loud rip. Three toes with long sharp talons at the end pushed their way out from the remnants of her footwear. Both women were shocked to see thick green scaly skin on her feet instead of the soft pink hue that covered the rest of Heather&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s feet had lengthened considerably and she guessed from the shape of them, that she would now be more comfortable standing on the new pads of her feet instead of the heel. The thick green skin on her vicious looking toes and feet didn&#39;t stop there, infact it appeared to have spead all the way up her legs. The two archeologists had to guess from there however because Heather&#39;s pants were doing all they could to fight against her swelling legs.<br />
<br />
Heather winced again in pain as another loud rip echoed through the chamber. A thick green appendage had burst through the seat of her trousers and now lay agaisnt the cool stone floor. Heather reached back and felt her new tail, confirming that not only was it attached, but she could definitely feel it too. It continued to push out and forced the studious blonde to roll onto her side. It finally stopped growing when it was about as long as she was tall.<br />
<br />
Heather had little time to contemplate having a fifth appendage before her legs won their battle with her pants. Her trousers split up the seams exposing huge calve muscles and revealed thick green skin, which extended all the way up to her waist.<br />
<br />
Heather ran a hand over her new legs as the pain subsided. She was both in awe and horror of what had just happened. She flexed her sharp clawed toes and felt how powerful her muscles had become. Her tail helped keep her balanced as she slowly got up. She wobbled slightly on her unfamiliar feet and heard her claws click on the stone floor of the ruin.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m hiding this...&quot; Heather said in a depressed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; Melissa stammered. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to push you into that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Heather asked angrily. &quot;You planned on pushing me into one though? Which one did you want to run me into? That slug lady over there? Maybe this one with no arms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops... I didn&#39;t mean to say tha...&quot; Melissa was desperately looking for words to get her out of this but nothing was helping. &quot;...Maybe we should just head back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I hope you&#39;re fast Melissa.&quot; Heather said with anger building behind her eyes. &quot;Because if I catch you I&#39;m going to push you into that one over there.&quot; She pointed at a statue in the corner that had a massive dick that was decidedly not human.<br />
<br />
That was enough for Melissa to make a beeline for the exit. &quot;Noooo! Please, Im sorry!&quot; She yelled trying to appease the now half reptile woman.</p>
