<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angered and not willing to accept the fate chosen for by Lusious she would not eat or drink. As the discomfort of her ultimate changes began she thought of what Lusious said. She sat in front of him being philosophical about working for the farm and drank three cups of coffee loaded with caffine and serum. The serum would of begun anyway but the caffine put a hugh rush of change starting all at once.<br />
<br />
A hunger strike would only bring on terrible pains as her body would not have the physical building blocks to effect the change. So by the morning of her second day the anger and resolve faded. She watched as the guard slipped the tray of high protien grain mush and serum filled drink uder her door and ready for consumption.<br />
<br />
Joyce was getting mentally mixed up by the third day. She gorged down the food and drink as soon as it was passed in to the cell. Walking in circles she tried to keep her mind of the aches and pains growing in legs and every joint of her bones. The inner feeling to escape her fears made her try to run from them by doing all sorts of human styled excersize. Sit ups, jumpingjacks, pushups, deep knee bends, all the remembered ways to work off stress and keep her mind from thinking about what was for sure to come.<br />
<br />
As her first days became a week she had lost the concept of time. Now eat and excersize was her routine all day and every day. Lusious would check on her progress daily when the guards would let her out for toilet useage. Four times a day she would beg to go and use the facialities but as days went by Lusious saw the stress on her body from growing and had her moved to a box stall.<br />
<br />
Joyce now had enough room to run in big circles and needed no continued daily use of the human facialities. Yet more space offered more attention to he plight as she began to notice outward signs.<br />
<br />
In her first days the soft tissue was under easy attack by the serum. Skin colour, texture, as well muscle tones began to change looking much like equine type. As the joint pains surged in her total body till she would scream Joyce had to stop whatever she was doing.<br />
<br />
To stop and sit with pains from movement she then took account of her body. Where skin had become black and thicker the hairs of sorral coloured grew.  Toes were puffy and swollen as the nails began to merge as she saw a hoof like horney lump form on the end of each foot.<br />
Feet too were growing longer as her heels looked far more like hocks on a horse. Thigh muscles had broadened become flattened and wider. She would walk about hunched over as the human leg was pulled and growing into a equine shape.<br />
<br />
Arms too looked and felt longer as her wrists looked too as if they were knees. Metacarples fused into a shin bone as finers like toes swelled and the nails poured out hornblend till a black hoof was the end to each appendage.<br />
<br />
Now she nolonger could scoop her food from the foor tray to her mouth and a bucket was then the delivery method for eating. To use her thickening lips as hands to reach and grab at the mush in the bucket and stretching her tongue to lick the last reminants clean her facial muscles were under attack. <br />
<br />
The daily rations of protien grain mush now mixed with powdered milk, serum, hormones, water, fodder and an introduction of grass shredded mixed into a slurry and served eight time per day made growth much easier. Weight was building and muscles flexed to massive size as the Welsh pony form was fast taking shape.<br />
<br />
Facial form had begun to change and severe pain of sinus' and glands screamed of change. Breathing heavy breathes she exhaled making snorting sounds that for some reason was calming and fun. Almost as an excersize she took deeper and deeper breaths. Then she would relish in the sensual feeling of the rushing air rippling her nostrils and lips into a snorting sound. This play time would go on for hours at a time till Lusious would come and check on her health.<br />
<br />
As the face grew and a muzzel pushed forward, lips and mouth became organized into a true pony like head. Ears now moved and twitched as sperate antenna's for sound. Yet the smaller constraints of the cranium brought on a degrading of human ability. Speach was first to go as snorting and a screaming whinnie became her mode of communication. Writing was now out of the question as legs were trained to run and not coordinated for such movments. Joyce seemed each day to be in total acceptance of her assigned form and made no angry moves toward Lusious.<br />
<br />
The serum was stopped as Lusious noted her mental losses were more than he expected. The change of organs from her female human self to that of a stallion's plumbing came on without much care or notice by Joyce. Lusious thought this to be odd since if she was alert the feelings of a sex change should have been profound.<br />
<br />
A full month had passed when Lusious let the stallion Welsh pony out into a private corral. Joyce stood with her upper lip curled and head heldd high as the stallion in her drank in the scents of mares. Her daytime delight was to stand with lip curled and her pony cock erect masterbating hour after hour. It was this action that suggested to Lusious that the change in sex had tipped her mind past being a human thought pattern inside a pony brain, but she had in fact accepted the equine instincts and purged all human thoughts herself.<br />
<br />
Lusious stood and looked at a total Welsh pony stallion. Joyce was equal to a five year old animal in growth size and strength. A total animal could be used or sold since no mental cares were being shown by the subject. Joyce had found a new way of life and accepted it in mind, body and soul.</p>
