<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You run your hands around her hips and find small bumps like pimples. The skin seems slightly irritated, but okay on the whole. &quot;This isn&#39;t bothering you?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just a little itchy at times, but it&#39;s fine otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re alright. Some of what I&#39;m hearing is a bit odd. This seems like it&#39;ll go away in a few days.&quot; You say, hoping you&#39;re right. &quot;Let&#39;s eat that dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
You head downstairs as she redresses herself and relax to a fine dinner. Afterwards you turn on the tv, and catch part of the news. Again, they caution people to stay home as much as possible, with people waiting hours to have strange rashes looked at, and extra appendages removed. You switch the station, trying not to look at your wife.<br />
<br />
..The next day.<br />
<br />
You wake up before your wife again. Turning over, you gently lift her shirt and lower her pajama pants to have a look at her rash. The bumps seem slightly larger, but less irritated, and the skin between them seems to be raised, but it&#39;s hard to tell. You kiss her and head off to work.<br />
<br />
Your coworker, Charlie, is furiously scratching his foot. &quot;Hey, that&#39;s kinda annoying, do you have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s terribly itchy, and I can&#39;t get in to see my doctor right now, what with all this craziness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try some lotion.&quot; You suggest.<br />
<br />
He glares at you and leaves the room.<br />
<br />
You go about your day, avoiding the news as best you can. After a couple of hours you can&#39;t help but text your wife.<br />
<br />
-How&#39;re you feeling?<br />
<br />
-Still kinda sick, but I&#39;m okay. A little itchy too.<br />
<br />
-Maybe you should take a bath. Those salts might help.<br />
<br />
-Okay, if I have time.<br />
<br />
You run into Charlie near the end of the day. He&#39;s using one foot to scratch the other as subtly as he can. You exchange pleasantries and joke about his foot, and then head home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; You call into the house, not seeing your wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;In here&quot; you hear her call from he bathroom.<br />
<br />
She&#39;s laying down in the tub, with the water up to her chin, and her hair floating everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm..&quot; She answers. &quot;The itching is gone, and my stomach feels better. I don&#39;t want to get out though..&quot; She adds, closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
You put your hand in the water and find her hips. The pimples have grown, and become visibly less irritated. The skin between them has risen, forming a connection between each one. The extra skin connecting them doesn&#39;t go straight from one to the other, it dips slightly. Notably there is one pimple on either side of her pubic triangle, and the skin extending between dips slightly, but remains above it. The same is true for her buttocks, with the skin flap dipping, but staying just above.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems things have changed a little, but nothing too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not too bad&quot; She comments without opening her eyes. &quot;Normally, I would be more worried, but after watching the news, I know I have it better than most. Some people have grown dog tails, others have had their ears fall off.. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; You&#39;re astonished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.. they haven&#39;t said much about the leaked experiment, but it seems animal DNA is getting mixed in with other people&#39;s as a result.. and having strange effects. There&#39;re a lot of emergency surgeries happening. Once things calm down, it&#39;ll be easy to have this removed, I&#39;m sure. Just a little extra skin and tiny growths.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s not a problem.. one of my coworkers was scratching uncontrollably today.. I wonder if he&#39;s affected..&quot;<br />
<br />
At work the next day you can&#39;t help but talk about what&#39;s happening. Everyone knows someone who&#39;s waiting to get help with a growth, skin problem or some other issue related to water contamination.<br />
<br />
&quot; I don&#39;t think it was an accident at all - you know these people, they want data and need subjects. Volunteers cost money.&quot; One coworker puts forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so.. I know one of the guys who works there and his own son is now green as a result! He wouldn&#39;t have knowingly done that&quot; another pipes in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally I&#39;m just mad my shoe doesn&#39;t fit!&quot; Charlie adds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it swollen? What happened?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that, I&#39;m my super sure.&quot; He lifts the aforementioned foot.<br />
<br />
It definitely does not fit the shoe properly. &quot;Does it still itch?&quot; &quot;Yeah, but something else is up - I don&#39;t balance as well either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should someone have a look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if my doctor were available, if he gone days ago.. I think he fled the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we have a look? &quot; someone else ventured.<br />
<br />
Charlie pauses, visibly uncomfortable. &quot;.. Alright&quot;<br />
<br />
He sits down and takes off his shoe, as best he can. &quot; no jokes, though. This isn&#39;t funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
His foot is quite mishapen. It&#39;s easier to see with only the sock covering it. You spy some long hairs poking over the black sock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeuugh.&quot; Someone exclaims.<br />
<br />
When he takes off the sock you realize that Charlie&#39;s foot has taken on many characteristics of a horse&#39;s hoof.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did that happen? &quot;You ask<br />
<br />
&quot;It got worse over night, but it all started with that damned rash!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your other coworkers comment, and some want to touch it. You walk away feeling slightly sick to your stomach. You text your wife.<br />
<br />
-hey honey, how&#39;re you feeling.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes, no response.<br />
<br />
are you there? Or napping :p<br />
<br />
You try to keep it lighthearted but find yourself rather worried. You wait half an hour.<br />
<br />
everything alright? I love you.<br />
<br />
She answers quickly this time<br />
<br />
sorry, I wasn&#39;t feeling well.. Still am not. I took a nap, and made some soup. I think I&#39;ll take a bath and maybe sleep some more.<br />
<br />
okay, feel better.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re relieved she answers. The rest of your day goes a little slowly, but you get home on time.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t see your wife, so you check the bathroom. Her clothes are there, but she&#39;s not. You find her in the bedroom. She&#39;s fast sleep, twisted up in the blankets.<br />
<br />
You grab something to eat, read a bit, take a shower and head to bed. She feels quite warm. You want to check her hips, but the way she&#39;s twisted in the blankets makes that impossible. You kiss her goodnight. She smiles sleepily, but says nothing.<br />
<br />
The next morning you find her twisted a little more, but her back is exposed. You pull aside her clothing to find the bumps have grown into small fingers of sorts, and the skin flap is now the length of a short mini skirt - covering her sex and her butt, but barely. The small fingers move slightly as she breathes, causing the flesh-skirt to move up and down. You glimpse her blue panties underneath. She&#39;s grown her own skirt! But these fingers.. Or.. Then you count the ones you can see and realize there are about eight of them. Is she turning into an octopus??<br />
<br />
You&#39;re not sure how to take this, but she stirs a little, as sick people often do In their sleep. She feels quite warm and you let her rest.<br />
<br />
On the way to work you google what&#39;s been happening, hoping for some remedy or advice that will save your wife.<br />
<br />
When you arrive at work, everyone seems a little quiet and uncomfortable. Not sure what&#39;s going on, you check your email.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s something from Charlie.<br />
<br />
Sorry everyone, I guess I&#39;m calling in sick today. It turns out my foot problem isn&#39;t just going to go away. It had spread quite a bit overnight. I tried the hospital and they said it was serious enough to get in. I&#39;m scheduled for an amputation this afternoon. Thanks for your thoughts, Charlie<br />
<br />
No wonder everyone is so quiet. You can&#39;t help but glance at the news. There are record requests for amputations. Some people&#39;s hands have quadrupled in size, one man had a large green reptilian ear on his face. Another had sprouted wings. They were all outraged, threatening lawsuits.. Everyone was speculation about how far this would go. There was utter silence from the tease arch group.<br />
<br />
You work through your day and come home to find your wife on the couch. She&#39;s wearing sweatpants and a tshirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey &quot; you say, planting a kiss on her lips as you sit down beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna watch a movie?&quot; She asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.. Which one?&quot; She starts to talk but as you snuggle closer you start to move your hand up her leg. She stops you mid thigh. &quot;No..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now&quot; She says, cryptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; You inquire.<br />
<br />
Silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay..? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I mean, I think so.. &quot; She answers, reluctantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you trying to hide what&#39;s happening to you?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I peaked at you this morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?..then... you .. know..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I mean. I think so. Why don&#39;t you tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She hesitates. Then stands up and pulls down her sweat pants. You can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s wearing underwear or not, as her privates are covered by an undulating flesh skirt. It had grown since this morning and was now about five or six inches. Eight small tentacles made up the frame of the skirt, but protruded beyond it by six inches or so. Your wife looked horrified and ashamed. &quot;I&#39;m turning into a freak..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;ll be okay.&quot; you move to hug her, &quot;You&#39;re not a freak. You&#39;re my wife and I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you so much.. I just.. I just don&#39;t know. How can you want me now..?&quot; She was on the edge of tears. &quot;you don&#39;t even like octopus&quot; she punctuated her humorous attempt with an involuntary cough.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this one.&quot; You move your hand to her &#39;skirt&#39;. It&#39;s soft and smooth. Definitely her skin, but thin and somewhat elastic. You massage a portion between your thumb and forefingers. &quot;Can you feel that?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiles &quot;a little, but it&#39;s like touching me through a glove..&quot;<br />
<br />
You move to the nearest tentacle and twirl it between your fingers. &quot;Now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, no.. it&#39;s like pulling at my belt.. I can feel it. but not directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it seems that this isn&#39;t even really part of you yet.. don&#39;t freak out just yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.. okay..but..&quot;<br />
<br />
She stops when you move your hand down towards her pussy and gently caress it. Her tentacles flutter a little. &quot;I bet that still feels good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;mhm.. it does..&quot;<br />
<br />
You proceed to massage as before and she collapses onto the couch to let you continue. You massage, pushing your fingers deeper and further back from time to time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should finish this elsewhere.&quot; She says with a sexy look.<br />
<br />
You head to the bedroom and grab a condom even before she asks. You put it on and turn around. She&#39;s already on her back with her legs apart.You&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re imagining it, but it seems her new appendages are opening the skirt as an invitation.<br />
<br />
You lay on top of her and guide your penis into her vagina. &quot;Ooh. mm. &quot; You&#39;re not sure which of you said that. You work into a rhythm of thrusting, faster and faster. &quot;Ohh. Yes. mm.. That feels so good..&quot; You both near your climax. &quot;AAHH!&quot; She arches her back slightly and her tentacles curl in. One of them strokes you behind your scrotum and you come immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.. well it&#39;s good to know all that still works.&quot; Your wife says with a happy sigh. &quot;Why don&#39;t you come here...&quot;. You fall into her arms and cuddle for a bit.<br />
<br />
You get up after a few minutes and enjoy a relaxing evening, watching a cheesy sci fi film. She seems to be more comfortable without pants for the moment, given the choice. She wanted to hide it all before, but now, her tentacles are definitely more comfortable out in the open. You go to sleep shortly after the movie.<br />
<br />
The next morning you, before leaving, you look at her tentacles. They seem longer and thicker. At their base, nearly as thick as your wrist. They now extend past her knees. They seem to have a different texture beneath - also, slightly darker. You kiss her cheek and leave for work.</p>
