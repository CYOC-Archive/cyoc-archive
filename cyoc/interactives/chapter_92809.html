<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was sleeping soundly after his excitement and dreamed that he and Jen had been found in the house. Kat was being restrained, and her wand was being held in front of her as she was being told something. Next Kat was in a cage, and the rescuers turned towards Dan. They were not people, or not 100% human. They were all part animal of some sort - cats, dogs, squirrels, monkeys, toads, hamsters, cows, rabbits, horses, pigs, and other things. Tens, then hundreds appeared surrounding Kat in the cage on a stand now in some sort of giant arena.<br />
<br />
 There was chanting that grew louder and louder. One by one, they each took the wand and hit Kat&#39;s cage. She screamed as her body twisted and contorted into different shapes, parts of various creatures intermixed - ears, eyes, arms, paws, hooves, tails, fur, scales, ... Finally, Kat gave one last scream, there was a flash of light and smoke, and the cage, Kat, and all the creatures disappeared.<br />
<br />
 Calm now ruled in his dream. The air was fresh and crisp. Dan could feel the sun peaking out and warming him as he played Frisbee running through a field to grab it as it sailed lazily away from him. In his sleep, Dan&#39;s legs began to twitch and move with happiness as he ran in the dream. Soon in his dream he became tired, hungry and found himself all alone. He waited for someone. Someone he knew well. Someone who would come for him. Someone who would take him home for food, and he liked them for that. The dream made him happy, and he started whimpering and almost barking in his sleep.<br />
<br />
 The sound of footsteps entering the room awoke him. His still sleepy eyes caught sight of a person, and he rose up instinctively, eagerly walking over wagging his tail. His mind was still drowsy, but his physical dog reactions just seemed to go off automatically. He knew this person well as the one who takes care of him, who feeds him, who takes him for walks, who changed him to this, who made him ... <br />
<br />
 &quot;That&#39;s a good boy.&quot; Kat said as she began to pat Dan&#39;s head and scratch his ears.<br />
<br />
 Dan had begun to remember what Kat had turned him into and made him do, and he was getting angry, but the scratching felt so good. He forgot again as his dog feelings overrode his human. He nuzzled against Kat as she rubbed up and down his back.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ready to go boy?&quot; <br />
<br />
 Dan bounced and barked when Kat mentioned go. He really did have to go, but he was confused as to why he acted like this? Why was Kat being so nice, and why was he being nice to his sister that he always teased? Then he remembered that he wasn&#39;t a dog. He was really a boy except ...<br />
<br />
 &quot;See ya rrrrround, Jen,&quot; Kat said indicating a big belly. &quot;And don&#39;t bother trying to tell anyone. You can&#39;t!&quot; Kat laughed as she pulled on Dan&#39;s leash. &quot;Hmmmm, now do I really want to wait two months for my puppies?&quot; Kat asked herself as she glanced over at Jen cowering in a corner.<br />
<br />
 Looking back, Dan saw Jen across the room on the floor and got a very troubling feeling. He knew something was very wrong. He had done something, something to Jen that he shouldn&#39;t. He hurt her and should help her, but he knew he couldn&#39;t do anything until he could deal with Kat. He hated Kat. He hated what he had done. He hated himself even more. Ashamed and scared of what he might do next or be made to do. He needed to get away, and he really had to go. His dog side knew that meant getting outside. So he trotted out the door.<br />
<br />
 Dan quickly turned to the first bush at the bottom of the steps, lifted a leg, and shot a gusher at it. His mind was now remembering completely his true predicament and what he had been doing. Feeling disgusted for that and angry at his sister, he growled then turned and walked over to the other side of the walk, sniffed that bush and raised his leg again while he wondered how to get back at his sister. His mind was becoming schizophrenic doing dog physical stuff from instinct while his human side still had logical thought processes.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Come on, Dan. Do you have to mark the back door, too, of your conquest&#39;s territory?&quot; <br />
<br />
 Actually, Dan the dog thought that he probably should for some reason and started around back, but a pull on the leash and he headed off down the walk. &quot;Oo! Another dog peed over here.&quot; and Dan went off the sidewalk and lifted his leg again. There were more interesting smells that kept distracting him from figuring out how he could escape his sister and get back.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Damn. It&#39;s hard to concentrate any more.&quot; Dan thought as his human side kept regressing. &quot;Oh. What&#39;s this object. it smells interesting.&quot; Dan licked it and then picked it up with his teeth and ran it around in his mouth.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Dan, NO. Drop it.&quot; Kat commanded, but Dan kept thinking how interesting it tasted and felt in his mouth. Kat pulled him over and tried to pull his mouth open. &quot;Bad dog. Open up. Spit that out.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Suddenly, Dan&#39;s mouth, nose, and jaw began to tingle, then get very warm. His lips began to swell and his nose got longer right before his eyes. Kat&#39;s fingers were still trying to pry his mouth open as his jaw extended becoming a large snout. Between Kat and his surprise, Dan relaxed his hold on the object and it fell to the ground. Dan now realized that his mouth had the most terrible taste and grit in it from whatever he had taken. He tried to spit and hack but only panted and drooled. Then he noticed what it was - some garbage with ants and little white worms, and he felt sick.<br />
<br />
 &quot;That was perfect, Dan. You&#39;ve changed even further. At this rate you won&#39;t have anything human left before the week is up, and I&#39;ll get to keep you.&quot; Kat cheered then stood back looking surprised and put her hand up over her mouth. Dan saw this and wondered what it was she said that she seemed she didn&#39;t want to let out. Was this possibly a clue to his escape? The thought gave Dan renewed hope, and he began to concentrate hard to keep his human character and mind. He would not let Kat take that from him. Not at least until after the week went by. Unfortunately, the more he tried to keep his human side, the more he was disgusted with what he&#39;d done as a dog.</p>
