<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of crunching leaves and twigs filled the night air as Connor followed the group down a winding forest trail. The path was only lit by the faint glow of the moon filtering through the trees, casting shadows that covered them in a blanket of darkness. <br />
<br />
Logan walked in front, his broad shoulders adding to the confident silhouette that stood against the surrounding darkness. Zack and Micah were side by side, their quiet chatter blending perfectly with the rustle of the trees. Eric brought up the rear, his hands stuffed casually in his pockets. <br />
<br />
“So, uh, what exactly are we going to be doing?” Connor asked, breaking the silence around them. <br />
<br />
Zack grinned and fell back slightly, giving Connor a playful nudge. “You’ll see. Trust me, it’ll be fun.”<br />
<br />
“You bet it’ll be fun,” Micah echoed. “Although you might want to brace yourself.”<br />
<br />
Connor raised an eyebrow, looking between the two. “Brace myself for what, exactly?” <br />
<br />
Before either of them could say anything, Logan cleared his throat, his steps slowing as he cast the pair a sharp look. “Let’s not scare him off before we even get there,” he said. He then turned to Connor, his expression softening slightly. “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
“Super reassuring,” Connor muttered under his breath, earning a chuckle from Eric. <br />
<br />
“Relax kid,” Eric said. “Something tells me you’re going to enjoy it. Besides, if you want to get to know us better, this is the way to do it.”<br />
<br />
Connor shot him a questioning look but ultimately said nothing, instead choosing to focus on the path ahead. The trail stayed relatively straight for the most part, with the occasional turn. The faint sound of rushing water could be heard, slowly growing louder as they kept walking. <br />
<br />
“Alright, turn here,” Logan said, making a sharp left turn onto a smaller, much narrower path that was almost hidden behind the trees. Had Logan not pointed it out, Connor almost certainly would have missed it. Just exactly where were they taking him? <br />
<br />
The rushing water grew louder as they followed the smaller path, and suddenly, the forest seemed to pull back. The trees thinned, giving way to a small clearing. The grass was thick and lush, dotted with small patches of flowers. In the center stood a large rock, its surface sloped and worn smooth by time, with the stream running just beyond it. <br />
<br />
“Wow…” Connor said softly, stepping into the clearing. “This is something…”<br />
<br />
“Sure is,” Logan replied. “Found this place on a hike a few years back. Ever since then, it’s sort of become our place to unwind.”<br />
<br />
“So, this is like a team bonding thing?” Connor asked. <br />
<br />
Micah laughed. “Something like that.”<br />
<br />
“Trust us, you’ll get it by the end of the night,” Zack added, nudging Connor before moving deeper into the clearing. “As long as you promise not to run, that is!”<br />
<br />
Connor’s expression shifted to one of confusion as Zack quickly moved behind the rock. A few seconds later, he emerged on top of the rock. <br />
<br />
“Looks like Zack’s volunteered himself,” Logan commented, sitting down in the grass before gesturing for Connor to do the same. Connor hesitated, but he sat down as well, looking up at Zack. <br />
<br />
“You ready for this, C?” Zack asked, a grin plastered on his face. <br />
<br />
“Ready for what?” Connor asked, his voice tinged with uncertainty.<br />
<br />
Zack didn’t answer. Instead, he took off his jacket and tossed it behind him, followed by his shirt. Connor blinked, caught completely off guard by what was happening. <br />
<br />
“Uh…what is he doing?” he asked, watching as Zack kicked off his shoes and began to unbutton his pants. <br />
<br />
“Just…watch,” Logan said quietly, though Connor could sense the hesitation in his voice. <br />
<br />
He looked back at Zack to see that he’d now fully stripped, revealing his semi-slim, athletic build and modestly-sized cock. The young man looked to the sky, a wide grin on his face as his breathing began to grow heavier.<br />
<br />
And then, it began. <br />
<br />
Zack groaned as his body seemed to grow, his muscles rippling underneath his skin. Connor stared wide-eyed and Zack’s shoulders broadened, his chest expanding. <br />
<br />
The changing man let out a sharp breath, followed by a low, guttural laugh. “Fuck…I always forget how amazing his feels,” he said, his voice trembling with exhilaration. <br />
<br />
“What…what the hell is this?” Connor asked, his heart pounding in his chest. <br />
<br />
“Just keep watching,” Micah said, casually leaning against a nearby tree and watching the display in front of them.<br />
<br />
Zack flexed his hands, his fingers elongating slightly as his nails sharpened into claws. He tentatively rubbed the palms with his thumbs, letting out a satisfied grunt as rough pads began to grow in on his fingertips and palms. His feet quickly began to do the same, his toes merging and reshaping into large, four-digit paws. Black fur began to sprout on his legs; first in small patches before spreading like a wildfire across the rest of his body. <br />
<br />
The sound of bones cracking and reshaping filled the air as Zack’s legs changed, forcing him to drop to all fours as they shifted to a digitigrade structure. The changing man arched his back and let out an almost blissful sounding groan as the end of his spine forced itself out of his body, elongating into a large, fluffy tail. <br />
<br />
Zack suddenly let out a gasp of pleasure before looking down beneath his legs. Connor followed his gaze, watching in a mixture of fear and fascination as the changing man’s cock began to grow. With each throb, it seemed to be getting longer, thicker…redder. His length seemed to increase from six inches to eight as the rounded head began to swell, tapering off into a point. The base seemed to swell as well, a large knot forming on the crimson organ. <br />
<br />
The fur had completely covered Zack’s body save for his face, though that was soon about to change. As the black fur crept up his neck, Zack let out another moan, letting his longer, flatter tongue loll out of his mouth. His nose and mouth both began to push out of his face. His nose quickly flattened, darkening and taking on a leathery texture, while his teeth sharpened into powerful fangs. <br />
<br />
His ears migrated to the top of his head, flattening and elongating into a more triangular shape. As the last of his skin was covered by the fur, Zack’s eyes shifted to a golden-yellow hue that seemed to glint in the moonlight. As the last of his changes finally finished, Zack threw back his head and let out a long, piercing howl. The howl seemed to act as a release for all the built up pleasure during his transformation, as Zack soon began to cum on the rock beneath him. <br />
<br />
When Zack’s orgasm finally died down, the freshly transformed werewolf stood up, revealing how much taller the transformation had made him. He rolled his shoulders a bit before leaping off the rock, grinning as he did so.<br />
<br />
Connor’s breath hitched as the werewolf took a step toward him, his mind struggling to process everything that he was seeing. The hulking figure before him was still Zack, but at the same time, it wasn’t. <br />
<br />
This couldn’t be real. This wasn’t possible.<br />
<br />
Zack took another few steps toward Connor, flashing him a lupine grin. “Relax man, I don’t bite,” he said, his voice low and playful. “Unless you ask nicely, that is.”<br />
<br />
“Y-You’re a…a w-werewolf…” Connor stammered, scooting back a bit as Zack approached him. He wanted to stand up, but Logan had put a hand on his shoulder. And then, it all clicked.<br />
<br />
The growls, the sharper teeth, the offhand comments about instinct, the references to them being a pack…<br />
<br />
His eyes darted to Logan, to Micah, and then back to Zack. <br />
<br />
“You’re <i>all</i> werewolves…” <br />
<br />
“Damn, thought you were never going to figure it out,” Micah commented, though he was quickly silenced by a cold glare from Logan.<br />
<br />
Before Connor could even process what Micah had said, he felt a hand settle on his other shoulder. He flinched, his head whipping around to see who it was, and he froze. Standing beside him was Eric, though it was less “standing” and more “towering”. The man had fully transformed, his dark brown fur blending into the shadows of the forest, with the only thing giving him away being his sharp, yellow eyes. <br />
<br />
“It’s a lot to take in, I know,” Eric rumbled, his voice a bit deeper, though tinged with a slight growl. “But this is who we are…and it’s what you’re becoming…”<br />
<br />
Connor’s eyes widened, darting between the massive werewolf beside him and the others nearby. “What? N-No, I’m not—”<br />
<br />
“You’ve already felt it, Connor,” Logan cut in, his tone steady but laced with an authority that he couldn’t deny. His piercing gaze kept Connor sitting exactly where he was, even though the man’s mind was begging him to start running. “The unexplained energy, your increasing muscles, your enhanced senses…they’re not coincidences…”<br />
<br />
Logan’s expression softened slightly. “You’re becoming a werewolf.”</p>
