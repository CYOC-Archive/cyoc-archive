<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac wasn’t really sure why he chose the Black Axiom, or if he even choose it himself, all he saw in his mindless state was himself growing closer to it, until it’s dark light enveloped him.<br />
<br />
“The Black Axiom, the youngest aspect to have been formed from creation, although that in itself was a lie. At best it is a falsehood, an imitation, an aspect that truly was never alive. It was created as a byproduct when the Corruption first spewed forth into creation, made from the countless lost souls who lost everything but their hope, by choosing this Axiom, you will ensure that all of their forgotten deaths, undying hopes, and unfulfilled dreams will never be in vain.”<br />
<br />
Isaac watched numbly as he began to feel a great pressure build up throughout his body. He could feel it, the corruption that had been contained within beginning to be purged, a new power was filling his mortal vessel, a power born from death and cruelty, one that paradoxically contained the hope of a multiverse without any more suffering.<br />
<br />
As Isaac’s body was forcefully cleansed of corruption, his humanity becoming restored as he reverted to his pure human state, he felt a strange sensation in his forehead, the crystal eye... it seemed to be reacting with the light of the Black Axiom.<br />
<br />
He watched as he felt the demonic eye slip out from the slit from where it originally resided and seemed to become coated in the Black Axiom’s light. Black magic swirled in the air as the crystal eye began to undergo some strange transformation... the presence in the eye, it was being killed.<br />
<br />
Within the eye black and green energy clashed chaotically within it, Isaac could feel a desperate struggle taking place, and the mind that once resided inside the eye was systematically being destroyed, even as it fought for it’s life.<br />
<br />
The struggle continued, until there was a sudden burst of black energy. The dark light began to glow brighter and brighter, completely obscuring Isaac’s vision, despite him not being truly aware of what was happening.<br />
<br />
When the light faded, all that remained was a simple sword made of a dark steel. It had no real design, only a simple hilt with the demonic eye, now a dull lifeless green residing on the blade’s hilt.<br />
<br />
“It seems that one of your corrupted relics has been purified by the Black Axiom, and in the process, the unholy mind that resided within it has joined the countless other souls that powers your Axiom.” The voice explained.<br />
<br />
“Regardless, the singular tenet of the Black Axiom is to ‘Temper Death’, what that means and how you shall fulfill it is something you will discover on your journey. By accepting the power of the Black Axiom, it is the single rule from which you and you alone will live by, for no other heroes before had ever arisen to this Axiom as their own... ever since the Corruption’s birth, no other hero save for you has ever ascended into the Endless Desert... you are the only one left....” There was a hint of sadness in the voice this time. Definitive sadness. <br />
<br />
But Isaac could do nothing to comfort the voice, even if he wanted to. The other five unchosen Axioms still glowed brightly even after being rejected. Even after Isaac began to feel himself moving away, rising back into the waking world, he still saw the glow of the Axioms.<br />
<br />
————————————————————————<br />
<br />
Isaac awoke... changed...<br />
<br />
For a moment he had remembered nothing not even his own name, then it all came back to him.<br />
<br />
His body nearly collapsed as the memories began to fill his mind. <br />
<br />
Too many thoughts were racing through his mind, he had to clear his head. <br />
<br />
He looked around, he was still in the oasis, and without a second thought or even a fleeting idea of concern, he dunked his head into the water of the oasis, feeling the cool waters wash over his head.<br />
<br />
He pulled his head out from the water and took several deep breathes... and noticed something was off. His hair... was much longer than he remembered... and... his limbs... last time he checked they had been erased to stumps... but they had regenerated... and become furred...?<br />
<br />
Isaac waited for the water, which this time hadn’t started to erase him, to clear and looked into his reflection in the afternoon light...<br />
<br />
He had transformed. At the very least from all this he was hoping to have gone back into a human, but he was just as monstrous as before. Staring back at him through the water’s reflection was the face of a large direwolf, deep dark green eyes that looked more like crystals than actually living eyes, he couldn’t even see any pupils, just pure emerald green...<br />
<br />
He stood up, and found himself disoriented as he found himself to be standing much taller than he had ever stood before. He looked down at himself to realize that he was naked, albeit covered in a thick layer of black fur.<br />
<br />
Why am I so muscular...? Indeed he was just below being freakishly fit. He was still quite proportioned, but it would be difficult to hide his large solid muscles, even under his fur. It seemed like he had spent an entire lifetime having worked out, as a paladin he exercised regularly, but never had he gotten to being anywhere close as muscular as he was now.<br />
<br />
Looking behind himself, he also saw that he had gained a new large furred tail, alongside some very powerful looking wolf legs, with razor sharp claws to boot.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t deny this body’s strength that was for sure. Despite his size Isaac felt like he could move freely and quickly without any downside, and the new strength his muscles packed made him feel unstoppable.<br />
<br />
Unstoppable... quickly Isaac stopped what he was doing immediately, standing still as he did a self examination of his mind.<br />
<br />
The voice said that the Black Axiom would’ve cleansed his body of any corruption and while that could be true, even with his new wolf body, had his mind received the same treatment?<br />
<br />
He breathed deeply as he scoured his own mind, searching for any hidden temptation, any corruptive thoughts, any dark whispers from his head, and any carnal desires to dominate and fuck. <br />
<br />
Isaac sensed nothing. There was nothing inside his mind but himself... he was pure, his mind had no corruption affecting it. He was elated... but he wanted to keep his expectations in check... looking down at his crotch, Isaac gulped as he saw his new package... to say it was a mighty wolf cock would be a lie. It was... massive. Even when at it’s idle state, the black furred wolf sheath he saw was massive, reaching all the way up to his bellybutton, and that wasn’t even measuring the thickness... it was nearly as thick as his forearm.<br />
<br />
His balls were a similar story as well, they were massive, nearly as big as his fists, and he could already hear them being to churn, almost growling as they began their production of fresh wolf seed.<br />
<br />
If Isaac wasn’t corrupted, then he might as well be considering how many corrupted traits he had right now.<br />
<br />
But there was one final test. Being hung was one thing... but did he have the oversensitivity of a corrupted being...?<br />
<br />
He didn’t want to risk touching his new sheath directly, lest he suddenly be bombarded with lust and instantly begin to jack off. Instead he walked over to one of the oasis trees and gingerly in a comedic pose, brushed his sheath against the tree’s bark.<br />
<br />
Nothing. He was expecting some surge of pleasure, some temptation to keep stimulating his sheath, yet his cock did not rise from his pouch at all.<br />
<br />
He brushed it again, harder this time, nothing again, it felt the same as brushing his arm against the bark, mildly rough and scratchy but no real sensation.<br />
<br />
Hmm... despite his new size was he perhaps sterile now? The thought gave him mixed feelings.<br />
<br />
Looking down, he decided to touch his cock directly, and in his big wolf paws, he felt the weight of his cock and balls under his paw. Once again, nothing...<br />
<br />
Perhaps he truly was immune to lust now.... or perhaps he simply had the wrong mindset? After all, he was consciously putting in the effort to stop any sense of pleasure as soon as it appeared...<br />
<br />
This time, Isaac decided to let down his barriers, and truly pleasure himself.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately the difference was there.<br />
<br />
Pleasure began to throb outwards from his dick, the slightest touch from his paw now completely sending him in spirals as from the depths of his stimulated sheath, rose his canine cock, with it’s flesh a dark green, the same shade of green as his eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost immediately Isaac began to masturbate, to pleasure himself, using his muscled paws to jerk off his monster of a cock that was growing bigger and bigger by the second, the lust filling his mind... yet never taking control...<br />
<br />
Realizing the sudden surge of pleasure, Isaac forced himself to stop his lustful desires... and stop they did. His cock despite having begun to leak out pre, had already started to slowly reenter it’s sheath.<br />
<br />
The pleasure he felt was real... as real and intense as it was when he was corrupted, yet Isaac found himself able to control it, to will his lust as easily as he could his hands. The lust was under his control, not the other way around...<br />
<br />
Fascinating... <br />
<br />
Isaac continued to masturbate now, wrapping both hands around his meaty length as he began experimenting with something.<br />
<br />
The first time he had started jacking off, he had stopped too early, there was something that hadn’t happened yet... something he had stopped from being completed.<br />
<br />
Thus, of his own volition, Isaac began to masturbate once more, deep in focus as he felt every throb of pleasure, every stimulated cock nerve. Something was happening, and it wasn’t orgasm. It was like, each time he jerked off his cock, it was becoming looser...?<br />
<br />
He watched as his cock almost seemed to slip free from his sheath, coming off as cleanly as could be as what was once a mighty wolf cock began to change form... he watched with both horror and fascination as within his own paws, his penis began to reshape itself, cock flesh turning into black steel as his wolf dick turned into the black sword he saw in his dream.<br />
<br />
The sword of the Black Axiom was in his hands now... and he had just figured out how to summon it.<br />
<br />
He looked down at his crotch once more and saw that another wolf phallus had already grown to replace the first, although this time Isaac didn’t dare try to pull it off.<br />
<br />
Isaac instead turned his focus back towards his sword, for him, it appeared to be well sized, the standard length for a long sword which he preferred to use, he could even hold it with one paw easily, this blade was perfectly balanced and sized. Well, for him anyways, it soon became drastically clear that what Isaac considered to be a one handed long sword was what a normal human would consider to be a gigantic impossible to use, much less lift, great sword...<br />
<br />
This new size thing is going to take a lot to get used to Isaac thought to himself. <br />
<br />
He had figured out how to summon the blade... but what about storing it...?<br />
<br />
An idea popped in his head, and with some considerable concern for his mental health, with one paw he angled his dick, willing himself to not feel any pleasure as he aimed the tip of the sword’s blade towards his sheath.<br />
<br />
Biting his lips slightly, Isaac was prepared to feel a stabbing pain as he began to push the blade into the hole of his urethra... instead of feeling his gentials being sliced open, Isaac was surprised to see the blade smoothly go inside his wolf cock, the flesh almost naturally stretching around the blade’s metal and hilt easily as the blade seemed to completely go back inside his phallus and effectively disappear. Once the sword had been completely pushed in, he couldn’t even feel the blade’s weight anymore, much less feel or see any protrusions.<br />
<br />
So... Isaac’s sheath was now a sheath in two ways now...<br />
<br />
Isaac sighed, he had an entirely new journey ahead of him now.<br />
<br />
Putting his new sword dick at the back of his mind, Isaac surveyed his surroundings looking for any indications on where he should go.<br />
<br />
The voice told him he would be led down a path that would introduce him to both a mentor and allies, yet the voice also told him he’d be cleansed of corruption and yet he stood as a definitely not human wolf man.<br />
<br />
The desert sun began to edge closer towards the horizon as afternoon slowly turned into dusk.<br />
<br />
After some thought Isaac decided to...</p>
