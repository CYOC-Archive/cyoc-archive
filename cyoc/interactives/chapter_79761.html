<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jim got out of the stall in the men’s bathroom, Zane was gone.  Zane had briefly been in the men’s room to take a wiz, but Zane had <br />
already gone about his business, as he came by urinating in the urinal, washed his hands, and went.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a mysterious 18-year old, blonde haired boy in glasses had showed up to the bathroom.  He had a sleek, slender body, with a <br />
smooth chest, with beautiful dirty blonde,brownish hair.  He wore a white T-shirt underneath a red sweater vest, and wore skinny light blue <br />
jeans as well.<br />
<br />
He had been following Jim around, as he snuck into the office building in search for his friend.  Obviously, this boy was smitten and in love with <br />
Jim, but he also had a secret that he wasn’t sure to tell yet.<br />
<br />
When Jim opened the door of the stall, he saw the boy right in front of him.  He didn’t know what the boy wanted, but it was rather clear the <br />
boy was attracted to him.<br />
<br />
Jim asked the young boy, “Are you looking for someone?”<br />
<br />
The boy smiled and licked his lips, and used his tender, dainty hands to touch Jim’s ripped chest.  To Jim, the young, blonde haired boy looked <br />
almost too beautiful to be a man, but had no obvious features to be declared of the other sex, either.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the young blonde haired boy had a rather mischevious grin on his face, as he was clearly up to something, something that he was <br />
deeply thinking on his mind.<br />
<br />
With this, the boy stammers happily, “Oh my god.  Hello, handsome.  I mean, hello, sir.  Name’s Ti-Ti-Ti-Ti….Timothy.  How are you today, <br />
sir?”<br />
<br />
Jim didn’t know whether to bolt, or to converse, but suddenly remembering that his dad told him that he was the (unofficial) boss of the office <br />
building, he decided to converse with the young boy.<br />
<br />
Jim said shyly, looking at the young man, “Hey Timothy.  My name’s Jim.  Are you new here?”<br />
<br />
Licking his lips, Timothy said, “I’m just visiting for today.  But you can hire me as your assistant, if you want.”<br />
<br />
Jim agreed, as he then replied, “Alright.”<br />
<br />
He then said unabashedly before retreating to a meek tone, “On a scale of 1 to 10, how hot am I?  I mean, if you were to swing that way.”<br />
<br />
Jim then said, “Well, I don’t believe in rating scales…but since you’re a stunningly, attractive young man, I’d give you a 10.”<br />
<br />
Unable to contain his excitement, Timothy said to Jim delighfully, “Holy shit, yeah.  I want make the fuck out with you, rip your pants off, and <br />
give you the best bj ever.”<br />
<br />
Jim wanted to beat off to Timothy so badly, as to him, he was certainly more beautiful than any of them he'd been with.  He thought for a <br />
moment, that maybe Timothy was too cute to be a man, but Jim felt that Timothy was just a really cute, homosexual young man who could also <br />
pass for a woman if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
As they stared to each other's eyes, Timothy suddenly ripped his sweater vest off in a heat of passion, and made out with his friend Jim, as they <br />
suddenly locked lips in a passionate frenzy, and tongues with each other.<br />
<br />
As they were making out, Jim and Timothy hugged each other, but Jim felt something strange that was rubbing up against his chest.  It wasn’t <br />
hard pecks, but a cottony sort of fabric, combined with something softer and mushier altogether.  Jim knew the young, blonde haired boy was <br />
skinny, but somehow the young man that stood in front of Jim had a lot less muscular chest than Jim thought he’d feel.<br />
<br />
Timothy wanted to suck Jim’s big dick hard, but suddenly in a panic, he backed out.<br />
<br />
In a frightened panic, Timothy suddenly said abruptly, “I can’t.”<br />
<br />
Jim asked his new friend, “What’s wrong, Timothy?  I get it.  You're retracting your feelings for me, because you remembered you're a straight <br />
boy, and you no longer want to get with me.”<br />
<br />
Timothy suddenly said sheepishly, “It's not that.  I mean, may I am straight, but I will be gay for you, if that's what you want.  It's just...I don’t <br />
know, Jim, I just can’t.  I’m not ready yet.”<br />
<br />
Jim said, “Well, I have a meeting with my friends, Katie and Tiffany that I’ll have to get to.  You know, I kind of have something important to tell <br />
them.”<br />
<br />
Timothy really perks up as he says, “You do????”<br />
<br />
Jim replies coolly, “Yup.”<br />
<br />
As this topic piques his interest, Timothy asks Jim nervously, “How well do you them?” <br />
<br />
Jim responds, “They’re my best friends.”<br />
<br />
With that, Timothy thinks that maybe there is a striking resemblance between Jen and Jim.  He wonders to spot the connection between the <br />
two, but doesn’t move forward with this.<br />
<br />
Timothy stammers as he blubbers out, “Anyways, Tiffany…I-uh….she’s uh….she’s my sister.”<br />
<br />
Jim replied, “That’s cool.  Can you give me a lift to their place?”<br />
<br />
Timothy replies nervously, “Um….I have to be somewhere…..but if I change my mind, it’s a maybe.  I’ll definitely let her know.”<br />
<br />
Jim says, “Thanks.  Hey Tim, thank you for being such a good friend.  Maybe next  time, we’ll blow each other.”<br />
<br />
Timothy replies gleefully, “Oh my god!  That would be so hot!  Thanks, bud.”<br />
<br />
Timothy then promptly kissed Jim on the cheek, picked up his sweater vest, and was so giddy, that he forgot to wash his hands before leaving <br />
the men’s restroom.<br />
<br />
With Jim, something was up.  He had never heard of a twin brother named Timothy, that was related to Tiffany.  Meanwhile, Timothy was <br />
struggling to make the connection of Jim to Jen. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jim was wondering if Timothy was too cute to be a cisboy.  He decided that he was just an abnormally good-looking young man, <br />
even if Timothy did look good in a bit of a feminine sort of way.  He was dazzled at the sheepish, yet sort of flamboyant young man that he had <br />
just kissed.   <br />
<br />
Jim couldn’t wait to rip Timothy’s shirt and pants off, and Timothy felt the same about Jim, yet Jim couldn’t get Timothy to remove his clothes.  <br />
He suddenly thought, 'Could Timothy be Tiffany?'  No, he thought, that would be ridiculous.  Or would that be?  Jim suddenly thought against <br />
the idea that Timothy could be a girl in disguise, as Jim felt he kissed a man, a really gay man, hard on the lips, and to him, it felt so good.<br />
<br />
While Jim felt Timothy looked like a slightly, more masculine, male version of Tiffany, he did think he kissed a beautiful boy on the lips in that <br />
room.  With that, he was satisfied.  But he felt it was his mission to feel up Timothy's crotch the next time.<br />
<br />
For Timothy, he was relieved, as he enjoyed making out with Jim in the men’s room, as he found this way more exciting than what he does on a <br />
daily basis.  He had a secret that he wasn’t sure to tell Jim, and Jim had another secret that he didn’t yet tell Timothy.<br />
<br />
As Tim walked away, he scratched inside his shirt, as he was feeling it to be more difficult to breathe, but refused to take his shirt off.  He <br />
couldn’t wait to rave to Katie about his new friend, Jim.</p>
