<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Amy had checked in at the front desk of the inn and were guided to their room.  By the time they got in Amy was amazed by it and so was Jeff.  It would seem that the husband side of him had gone all out and had gotten a two floor suite with a living room and kitchen are on one floor and a bedroom of their own on the second.  But of course, the husband side upgraded to a romance package for the two of them as there is a bottle of wine near the mini-fridge, chocolate covered strawberries and lovely freshly smelling floral decor on the living room table, and romantic candles on the dining table meant for a candlelit dinner for the two of them.  Combine that with plush furnishings and red draperies on the huge window overlooking the view, it was the perfect romantic gateway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jeff, you did all of this?&quot; Amy asked in awe.<br />
<br />
Jeff could see it as well as his mind was remembering reserving the room and package months in advanced and not wasting a single penny.  Remembering this, he smiled and said, &quot;Yep.  And it is all for us.  You like it, love?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy turned to him and said, &quot;Like it?  Sweetie, I love it!  It&#39;s amazing.  It reminds me of our honeymoon.&quot; She soon lean on his arm and nestled her head on his chest as the thought of the two of them having sex came into her mind.<br />
<br />
Jeff also remembered about that night of their honeymoon like it was just yesterday.  Although it technically wasn&#39;t true.  He found that he was having trouble remembering more and more of his old life as a teenager and his adult memories were beginning to seem like reality to him.  What&#39;s more, every moment he spent with Amy, he was seeing her less as the sweet and innocent little sister she once was, and more of the wife she currently was.  He looked down at his wedding ring and suddenly the memory of their wedding all came to him at once.<br />
<br />
He remembered the beautiful spring day he proposed to her at their favorite spot in the park. How thrilled Amy had been, and their friends and family all attending the wedding. Then he thought once more of their wedding night and how glorious it had been for the two of them.  And finally, the honeymoon down in the Bahamas as the first time they hit it was when Jamie came into their lives.  Jeff was amazed that all this was happening to him in less then a day as he could feel his old self feeling more like a dream and less real.  He soon wondered if Jamie was going through with some similar things as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun?  Do you heard me?&quot; Amy said looking at her husband with concern.<br />
<br />
He shook the idea off when Amy had said something to him.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry darling, what did you say?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
Getting his attention, Amy told him, &quot;Well...  I was thinking that since this reminded me so much of our honeymoon together.  I was wondering if we can reenact that moment together.  Right- down- to- that- time...&quot;  Each word led to her popping each button on his buttoned shirt, exposing his hairy chest.<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that and looked to her in surprise.  Amy was really becoming more of a wife then a little sister at this point and fear what would happen if they really do it.  There was that close call before, but he didn&#39;t know what came over him.  He just want to settle in and relax for a bit.  But seeing her sultry look and tracing her finger around his chest hair, that feeling came back to him, like fright truck.  Almost immediately, the other side of Jeff took control as he smirked and said, &quot;Amy...  I thought you never asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two soon drew their faces together and gave each other a romantic kiss.<br />
<br />
Once they let go, Amy was feeling lustful as she told him.  &quot;Carry me to our bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded as he bent down and lifted her off the floor, with his hands on her back and legs in a bridal way with Amy holding onto to him by the neck.  Jeff carried her over to the circular stairway as there were a trail of red petals on the steps with battery litted candles on the side, leading them to their bedroom.  As they climbed up the stairs, the orginal Jeff was watching on and has no control of himself.  It&#39;s like his body was on autopilot as if someone else is controlling him.  And judging by what was happening, he fears where this is going to lead.  By the time they reached the second floor, they entered the bedroom and were amazed at what they see.  In front of them is a kind size bed with red petals all strewn on the covers in the shape of a heart while the nightstands have un-litted scented candles that will filled the room with special fragrance.<br />
<br />
Seeing that, Amy was amazed by that.  &quot;Oh, Jeff...  This is lovely...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to her and said, &quot;I know, my dear.  But not as lovely as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two looked at each other again and kissed each other while Jeff was still holding Amy.  Almost on instinct, Jeff walked towards that bed and lay his wife on the bed.  Amy soon sat sexily at the edge of the bed and kicked off her heel sandals exposing her delicate feet.  &quot;Well...  What are you waiting for.  Do me like you did on our honeymoon.&quot; Amy said as she licked her lips for a good time.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a nod and stepped out of his brown loafers, slowly bend down to her and kissed her on the lips.  That kiss got deeper as the tongues entwined.  Jeff soon pushed her wife down and was on top of her, as they continued to kiss.  The two soon rolled around on the covers as red rose petals were covering their bodies.  By now, they were groping each others clothing as they were sitting on their legs.  Jeff started to lift off Amy&#39;s pink blouse, exposing her bra containing her big and saggy breasts while Amy unbottoned Jeff&#39;s top and she pulled it off his body, showing his muscles shirt.  Jeff soon gave Amy a romantic hug and give her tiny kisses on the neck.  As he was doing that, he guided his hands over to the bra strap on her back and slowly unfasten them.  Once he heard it unsnapping, he slowly peeled the bra off and she was half naked.  At the same time, Amy grabbed the bottoms of Jeff&#39;s muscle shirt and lift it off.  Tossing their garmets aside, they looked at each other and were amused by how they look compared to when they were on their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;God...  I miss those muscles and abs you once had.  You look like a litteral bear from the neck down.&quot; Amy said as placed her hand on his hairy chest and gave it a rub.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled and said, &quot;You&#39;re one to talk.  Your breasts are much bigger then before.  And honestly, it&#39;s really hot.&quot;  He soon placed his hand on one of her boobs and carass it.<br />
<br />
Amy felt the pleasure of him rubbing her breast and gave a light moan.  &quot;Well, what can I say.  Bigger is better.  Which I can say the same to what&#39;s underneath your pants.  Shall I...warm it up for you.  She soon started to slowly lay Jeff on the bed and positioned herself with her crotch on top of his.  Slowly, she dried hump her husband while he caress her breast, squeezing it harder.  The gyrations were turning both of them on as Jeff could feel a stirring in his pants.  He knew that his dick was eracting as Amy could see that the muchroom tip was poking out of his pants.  Amy licked her lips and guided her hand down to Jeff&#39;s pants, ready to take it off.<br />
<br />
Jeff was in pure bliss as he was about to go the distance with his wife.  But then, he felt that something wasn&#39;t right.  Slowly, the old teenage Jeff was resurfacing as he realized what was going to happen.  He was about to fuck with his little sister, who is now his wife.  He doesn&#39;t want this, but yet, this otherside of him is in desperate need of it.  Fighting for control, Jeff managed to regain his sanity and he immediately pushed Amy off with the same hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy was pushed back and was shocked that Jeff actually stopped their action mid way through.  &quot;Aw...  What&#39;s wrong.  I thought you want to re-experience our honeymoon.&quot; she said a little upset.<br />
<br />
Jeff soon regained his composure and said, &quot;I know...  It&#39;s just that...  It&#39;s a little too soon for that now.  I mean we have just got to the Inn.  You think maybe it&#39;s best that we...wait it out until the time is right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy was a little confused by what he meant by that.  But then, a thought came into her mind and she said, &quot;Oh...  I see...  You want to save this for our last day here, are you?  Very well...  I&#39;m a patient woman.  I&#39;ll wait until Saturday night to finish what we started.&quot;  Adjusting her hair, she slowly got off the bed and said to him, &quot;I&#39;ll unpack and change.  I do want to see what the Inn can offer for a full week.  Who knows, maybe there&#39;s something we can do together during then.&quot;  She soon turned to him and gave a wink before walking away with her saggy breasts jiggling and hips swaying with each step.<br />
<br />
Jeff waved to her and said, &quot;Sure, dear.  Let me be in the bathroom and freshen up.  It&#39;s been a long drive and I need to clean myself up.&quot;  With that, he hurried to the bathroom to recollected his thoughts.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, which has not only the basic needs, but also a jacuzzi tub for intimate bathtime, Jeff sprinked his face with water and was trying to process what he almost did.  &quot;I...  I can&#39;t believe I did that.  I was about to cum inside Amy!  My Sister!  What was I thinking?!&quot;  Grabbing a hand towel, he was still contemplating on what to do.  &quot;And I have until Saturday to control these urges.  The last day before we all return to normal.  Oh...  This is so going to be a long week.&quot;  Placing the towel over his face, he needed to calm down.  &quot;Relax Jeff, you can do this.  Just as long as you keep your hormones in check, you might be able to last the week without having sex with your lovely and sexy wife...  er-  I mean sister.  Sheesh, I&#39;m still having a hard time remembering Amy as the sweet and innocent sister she was.  And now with her behaving all erotic and all, it would be difficult to control it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he removed the hand towel from his face, he looked at himself in the mirror, only to see it mouthed something on the reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you fighting back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff watched on and was a little confused at his reflection starring back at him, looking rather serious and convincing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; was all he said before he could hear a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, is everything all right in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing Amy at the door, he looked back only to see just himself in the mirror looking confused.  Shaking off that thought, he told her, &quot;Yeah, dear.  I&#39;m good.  Just watching up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry up will you?  I want to see what this Inn has to offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff heard her and sighed deeply.  &quot;Sure thing, Amy.  Let me change clothes too and we&#39;ll leave together.&quot;<br />
<br />
He soon left the bathroom, trying to forget what he just seen.  He just hope that Jamie isn&#39;t going through the same thing he&#39;s experiencing.</p>
