<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke was walking with his friends when he felt a sudden pain in his butt. He tried to resist it in order to don&#39;t be mocked by his friend, so he began to walk funny until they reached Kyle&#39;s home.<br />
Kyle&#39;s parents were gone that night and her older sister had plans to go to a party, so the house was practically for them. Kyle had bought chips and sodas, and was ordering pizzas. There was a lot of videogames and they had intentions to watch some movies too.<br />
As the boys were preparing the stuff, Luke went directly to the bathroom. He quickly closed the door, sat on the toilet and began to push, but his efforts were useless because nothing was happening. He began to worry that something worst was happening to him when the pain made him to enforce. This time something was happening, painfully, but it was coming out.<br />
It was the worst constipation in his life and in no time he began to scream in pain.  Kyle and his other friends thought that he was joking and began to make fun of him, but Luke was having a veey tough time until it fell in the toilet water making a loud splash sound.<br />
Luke&#39;s face was totally red and sweating, even some tears can be seen on his face, but at least, the pain was gone. He took some toilet paper and prepared to clean his butt that was even more red than his face. It was painful to touch his still sensitive butt, however, when he looked at the toilet paper in his hand he realized that there wasn&#39;t any poop on it.<br />
If he didn&#39;t poop then what came out from him? He wondered, he stood up and saw what made that loud splash sound.<br />
It was an egg, a common egg. Like the ones that he use to see in a grocery store or a farm.<br />
He didn&#39;t understand how was that possible and before he could think about it, the sudden pain came back to him and he quickly sat again. However, this time it wasn&#39;t just an egg, it was one after another. It was like his butt has turned into an egg machine gun.<br />
After hearing that Luke&#39;s screamings were too loud to be a joke, Kyle and his friends began to worry. He drew near the bathroom and asked Luke if he was ok. He didn&#39;t get an answer but more screamings,  so he decided to slowly open the door and to see what&#39;s happening.<br />
There was Luke on the floor, crying in fetal position. His face totally red, sweated and covered in tears. His butt red and swollen, but most importantly, there was an egg stuck on it. Kyle was speechless. His best friend has an egg in his ass and,  as he looked around, he realized that there were eggs all over the bathroom. He can&#39;t believe what he was seeing, it&#39;s too unreal to be true.<br />
The eggs in Luke&#39;s ass fell to the floor breaking into pieces and a yellow yolk could be seen. It was the most disturbing thing that Kyle had seen in his life, at least until he saw the open anus where it came from. It wasn&#39;t just a fleshy big hole, it was covered in a disgusting mucous membrane and all of that was in his friend&#39;s anus!<br />
Terrified, Kyle had the urge to run away and look for help, but before he can even move, a sudden pain hit him. Just like Luke, he thought it was a constipation but unlike him, he wasn&#39;t able to go to the toilet an he began to lay eggs inside his shorts. Of course, he was screaming in pain, just like Luke did before.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in Luke&#39;s house, Tiff was worried of what could happen to her brother and his friend Kyle, because she had put some fruit puree on their meals before she knew they&#39;re leaving. She thought that she could call them or go to Kyle&#39;s home, but before she decided her boyfriend, Jared, arrived to her home. He noticed that she was worried and asked her if she had a problem. At first, she wasn&#39;t sure if she could tell him but she knew that she needed Jared&#39;s help.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Luke&#39;s friends were worried and uncomfortable of what was happening in the bathroom. One by one they were leaving the house and after an hour they all were gone.<br />
Luke had stopped laying eggs but his ass was still so red and swollen, and his anus was so open that he could put his fist inside. Next to him, Kyle had removed his shorts and boxers which were now completely covered in yolks and white. Both boys were scared crying in fetal position.<br />
<br />
Tiff was almost regretting her decision when Jared asked her to show him the fruits. She took the box she hid in her bedroom and showed them to her boyfriend. Jared noted that some of the fruits were labeled, he assumed those were the ones that she tried in her brother.<br />
They were quiet for a moment before Jared suddenly grabbed a fruit and took a big bite of it. Tiff was shocked but he just grinned when he began to feel his body changing.<br />
<br />
Luke and Kyle fainted in the bathroom before they realize they were still changing.</p>
