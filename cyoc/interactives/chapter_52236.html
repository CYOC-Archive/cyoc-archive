<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mark slept on he found a dark side to himself. One he had never <br />
wanted to admit and would tell himself that it was just strange <br />
thoughts floating around from things he had seen on the internet, in <br />
magazines or heard from other people. But now those ideas were <br />
beginning to emerge in his subconscious mind.<br />
<br />
As he stared into the mirror he found his arms going up in the air to <br />
show off his body. As they got full extension they were in some <br />
leather and fur lined shackles. Hand cuffs would be to fragile for his <br />
new bulk. He saw that there was a massive chain going to the ceiling <br />
and a large pulley that fed the chain through. It seemed to pull and <br />
pull until he was on his tip toes his thighs straining and bulging to <br />
keep himself from dangling like a rag doll.<br />
<br />
He saw a form emerge from the darkness at his back and as he got <br />
closer he tried to make out the image but it was always so very hazy. <br />
His arms came up behind Mark and started to rub him down from top to <br />
bottom in a very erotic fashion. Focusing on the folds in his muscles <br />
the over stretched upper ams the dangling calves and abs. Touching <br />
briefly on his nipples, ass and cock wanting to intensify Mark's sense <br />
of touch and arousing him sexually.<br />
<br />
As the man came around to his Mark's front he tried to get a glimpse <br />
of his face but there was nothing that he was able to recognize. His <br />
tongue licked Mark up and down and his hands caressed his new body but <br />
the high he was feeling in this dream was such that his thoughts were <br />
not as focused as they should be. When he moved from Mark and backed <br />
up toward the mirror the man was in darkness as he cranked down the <br />
chain lowering Mark onto a stool that seemed to give as he was lowered <br />
further and further. A hole in the middle of the stool pressed down as <br />
though there was some sort of spring to keep the stool pressed to <br />
Mark's ass. And then he felt something pushing at his asshole. He had <br />
never had anything pushing through his hole in that direction and it <br />
was a new exciting experience to him. When the man had lowered Mark so <br />
that there must have been a foot of this rod lodged into his hole he <br />
noticed several chains going from a belt around his waist holding him <br />
in place.<br />
<br />
Mark was in ecstasy.  His man meat was standing at attention and the <br />
man led a dog up to him and let it lick his dick pushing him over the <br />
edge. Again and again until the sweat poured down his face over his <br />
chest and dripping from his nipples like a gentle shower. That was <br />
when he saw or thought he saw a butterfly tattoo on the man's left <br />
butt cheek as he walked back to the pulley chain to reposition Mark <br />
for his next experience. Marks body was dragged over a table his hips <br />
and legs still chained down and the stool went with him the rod still <br />
lodged in his ass. His arms were secured to the opposite end and the <br />
man brought in something that sounded like it had hoofs there was some <br />
sort of clicking sound coming into the room.<br />
<br />
With a noticeable plop the rod came from Marks ass and was soon <br />
replaced by another rod. As Mark looked in the mirror he saw that <br />
there was something furry on his back. It wasn't a horse but it was <br />
quite large in several ways and it was buried deeper than the rod had <br />
been and if he hadn't been opened by that rod he would have been torn <br />
open wide. As it thrust and thrust Mark's dream mind was washing away. <br />
As the creature came inside of Mark He woke to find his nice big body <br />
as he was in the dream. His asshole even seemed to be dripping as if <br />
it had been used by a beast. But who was that man?<br />
<br />
It wasn't until he went to the gym a few days later he saw in the <br />
shower a man, not big not tiny, an average man that gave him a shiver. <br />
He watched him for his full workout. Even asking some of the others <br />
who he was and what he did. When he moved from one machine to another <br />
Mark would move near and when the man went to shower he watched as he <br />
turned on the shower in the communal shower and put his towel over the <br />
rack. Mark watched as he soaped himself up and that was when a cold <br />
shiver went up his spine. The rivulets of soap wrapped around the <br />
man's body down to his ass where Mark saw what looked like a <br />
butterfly. And as Mark felt that he recognized his dream man the man <br />
looked around and gave Mark a knowing grin.<br />
<br />
Who was in control of Mark's dream was it him or was it this man <br />
manipulating Mark's changes. Mark thought that he was the one in <br />
charge but now it seemed as though it might not be so.</p>
