<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The classic bell rang over the door as two plain clothes police detectives entered the Barber shop.  Surprisingly they found the Barber leaning against the main chair as if they were expected.  <br />
<br />
“Hey, afternoon.  I don’t know if you remember me…”<br />
“You’re the police officer, who came by a few weeks ago about that mini van out front, aren’t you?  I thought I’d seen you walk by the shop a few times in the last week, looking in briefly.  Something new with that case, Officer…...?”<br />
“Detective Vanderville.  Matt Vanderville.  No, no. I’m on a different assignment.  This is my partner Gary Calabono.  I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions.”<br />
“Sure.  Anything to help.  Would you gentlemen like a trim while we talk?  If you’re undercover it might look more natural if we talk while you’re in the chair.”<br />
“Eh, yea sure.  That’s good idea.” Officer Vanderville said getting into the chair.  He was a thin man, kind of lanky.  Good deal of balding, making him appear older than the late 20’s he was.  <br />
“Although neither one of us has that much for you to work on.” Detective Calabono said sitting in the waiting area.  He was stockier than his partner, older, later 30’s, with a clear head and classic horseshoe pattern hair MPB.  Its brownish/red tint almost suggested Bozo.  Both men were around 6 feet, pretty plain looking.  Going with the trend of the best undercover policemen don’t look like policemen at all.  Their clothes were a bit scruffy, trying to give off the impression they might work manual labor in the area.  Jeans and plaid work shirts.  <br />
‘Oh, I know it’s the Mounties who always get their men, but we Barber’s also always get our men…. looking good.”<br />
The two officers chuckled a politely at the lame joke.  “Well, anyway, we’ve been getting reports of athletes from the local colleges coming into this area to buy drugs.  And not Crack or Dope, but performance enhancing drugs.  Some of it dangerous and untested.”<br />
“It’s a lot of the newer kids, freshmen.  They come the from out of state, without parental supervision, or guidance, for the first time in their lives.  And the pressure to make the teams causes some to take rises they shouldn’t.  But we don’t think it’s their decision to take this stuff, we think they’re being influenced to the point of being forced.  Do you have a lot of the college crowd come in here?”<br />
“A few.  None of the jocks though.  You know how it is with the school crowds. You have to get one or two of the popular kids as regulars before the others follow.  And I’m just a simple Barber shop, not one of these trendy hair salons the hip kids use.” The Barber said as he finished tying the cloths around he two policeman’s necks. “I’m going to lean you gentlemen back as I wash the hair first.”<br />
“Oh OK.  Do you need to do that for a trim?  Anyway, yea I know what you mean” Detective Vanderville said “We can’t get the kids to talk to us, can’t find anything out from the Coaches.  And while the coaching staff says they know nothing about it, we can’t help but think they’re somehow involved.  Or some leads are coming from a couple of the Frat houses.  If we could make one contact we know it would lead to more.” the Barber rubbed his head with soap and warm water.  “That feels really good.”  <br />
“Just lay back and let the water drain off while I do you partner.” The Barber said moving over to his other customer. “So you’re looking for someone on the inside?  Or to get someone on the inside?  Have you tried hanging out at the local bars an, like, making friends with some of the jocks when they come in”<br />
“Ah, no.” Calabono said also enjoying his scalp being rubbed, “Honestly, that’s not going to work. Besides there’s a name for guys our age who hang out with college boys, if you get my meaning.”  This brought a bigger laugh from the two men than the Mountie joke earlier.  <br />
“Yea, but the only thing worse than these kids finding out we’re undercover cops before we’re ready to make the bust is if they started to think we were faggots.  We’re not going that far.” Vanderville said.<br />
“And certainly nothing beyond that.” the Barber said finishing off the second detective’s shampoo. “You’ll lay here and let the water drains off too. I’ve used a different hair product on you than Detective Vanderville but it should give a better result.  I’ll take care of your partner first.  Stay here.  Relax. Don’t move.”<br />
<br />
The Barber moved over to the first detective.  He braced the back of the chair and moved it into an upright position.  The policeman’s now long blonde hair flew foreword slightly.  It was wet but that helped show the curly strands at their best.  <br />
“We’re going to raise the chair a bit.  Let’s see how high we need it.” The Barber said.  Stepping on the side lever he started pressing down.  In the classic barber chair mode, it first went down a bit then up high, over and over.  And with each pump, Vanderville started to fill out.  <br />
The shoulders filed out, the chest pumped up, even the sheet around his neck pulled up.  Originally it covered his whole lap, but due to his size going to to 6’4”, it now exposed two big, thick tree trunk legs.  Smooth, except for a dusting of blonde hairs near the edge of the white sports socks and Nike trainer he now wore.  The face was still the same, but housed on a football player’s body and framed in a mop of corn silk colored blonde hair.  Vanderville looked at the mirror across from him and took it all in.  Something deep inside knew it was wrong, but not bad wrong.  Just not the way it was before.  And maybe the way it should always have been. <br />
 <br />
“Now about that hair.” The Barber said combing it out.  <br />
“Did I have blonde hair before” Vanderville asked in a deeper vice than before.  <br />
“Well, you asked for some highlights, but we have to do the cut first.”  <br />
“Cool” <br />
The Barber went to work, and as he clipped Vanderville changed.  After taking case of the length in the back, he brushed the hair forward and started working on giving the blonde giant long bangs in the front of his face.  A blunt cut that reach to just even with his eyebrows.  Giving his new face an innocent look.  The eye sparkled with blue green reflections.  The nose wasn’t quite as prominent but still large.  The jaw was strong if a bit pointed.  The lips were fuller, pouty almost.  An innocent face on the body of a football giant.  He couldn’t have been older than 19, and even that was a stretch.   A college freshmen for sure.  <br />
The Barber steps on the lift pedal again, this time letting the air out and allowing the seat to slowly lower to the floor level.  As the seat went down, blonde highlights lit up the football player’s hair.  But more importantly, the intelligence also went down.  Out went the thoughts of Matt Vanderville, undercover police detective, replaced by the thought of...<br />
“Donnie?” The Barber asked breaking his clients concentration from the mirror in front of him. “Do you like it?”<br />
“It’s great.  This will help me fit in with the other guys at the frat.”  <br />
“So will this.” The Barber said removing the cloth around Donnie’s neck.  It revealed the body of a muscle giant.  Not a bodybuilder’s cut and defined musculature.  But the body of a football player.  Big, hard and ready.  He now wore a simple pair of gym shorts and a half tee that didn’t even cover the bottom of his pecs.  Donnie’s pink/red nipples shown clears from under the edge of the fabric.  Almost as pink/red as the prick that pocked out from under the shorts’ waist band.  It oozed some precum and looked ready to blow.<br />
Off from the collar of the cut off tee, Donnie pulled a pair glasses and put them on.  Interesting juxtaposition of the big dumb footballer body and the glasses that usually make a person look more intelligent.  But on new Donnie, they just added a child like quality.  <br />
“Didn’t you have something you needed to take care of?  Something in your gym bag?” The Barber asked looking at a gym bag that now appeared on the floor.<br />
“Oh man, you’re right.  Can’t I use you bathroom?”<br />
“Go right ahead.  I’ll finish work on your friend.”  <br />
<br />
Donnie picked up the gym bag and walked off to the back of the store.  The Barber noticed how Donnie’s ass rolled back and forth under the silk like fabric of his gym shorts.  And how Donnie almost had to step around his inner thighs to walk correctly.  <br />
“How you doing over here?” The Barber asked raising Detective Callabono into an upright position.  Instead of the 30 + balding policeman he was speaking to Latino with long black hair from the tip of his forehead back.  A good beard had also grown in.  “Let’s get you into position too.”  The Barber said again raising the chair.  This time though, the police man shrank a bit with each pump. Down to about 5’4”.  He still filled out, maybe even more so than his taller partner.  But the cloth around his neck did go up to reveal that thick brown legs and solid ass now sitting in the chair.  The shoulders though, they came out form under the cloth.  Wider and wider with each pump up.  Biceps and triceps bigger than most melons in the Produce department.  <br />
‘My, my.  From MPB to all this.” The Barber said running his hand’s through Calabono’s thick black hair.  “What say we continue the trend and go the opposite?”<br />
“Sure” Calabono said continuing to stare at himself in the mirror.  He wasn’t sure who that guy was he was watching.  Wasn’t that part of the job?  Watching people.  Shouldn’t he see himself in the mirror?  And where was Matt, wasn’t he in the other chair?  The loud CLACK of the electric razor turning on stopped those thoughts as the Barber went to work giving the sides of his head a close fade cut up to the thick bush of hair he now sported on top of his head.  With each clip and cut the face of the man in the chair filled out to meet the ethnic ideal he now was part of.  Lips a bit fuller, eyes an almost almond shape and the color of earth.  When the hair was done it was left spiky on top, but could easily be slicked back for a tougher look.  <br />
The Barber removed the cloth to fully reveal the 18 year old Latino fireplug sitting in the chair.  Smooth from the neck down.  The beard now trimmed into a fine pencil line along with chin, but no mustache.  Shoulders so wide they were almost impossible to believe.  He wore a sweat shirt with a local college name on it, but with the sleeves cut off.  Under that it appeared he had a wrestler’s singlet on but under that, he was obviously going Commando.  Again, as the chair was lowered to the floor, the old police detective Gary Calabono thoughts and life disappeared only to be replaced with a correct one.  A more useful one.<br />
“All right?”<br />
“I’ll say” the wrestler said in a thick accent.  A sudden noise from the back of the store broke his concentration.  Out from the restroom, Donnie appears barely holding up his shorts and carrying a large dildo in the other hand.<br />
<br />
“Santos I can’t do this alone.  That room’s too small and I have to get this in.” Donnie whined in a child like voice.  His dick was swinging back and forth, having gone down since he left the room.  It was clear the small patch of dark brown hair above it was the only hair on Donnie’s body not on his head.  <br />
“MADRE DIOS Donnie!!!  What is the matter with you?” The new Santos asked getting out of the chair.  He only came up to his buddy’s collar bone but must have weighed the same.  “Don’t you know the difference between a dildo and a butt plug?”<br />
“Ummm.  No?” Donnie asked sort of confused about the question. <br />
“Good answer.  Obviously not.  The Frat Council told us we had to wear a butt plug through the hazing, not a dildo.”<br />
“I thought this would be more fun.”<br />
Oddly Santos couldn’t come up with a answer for that since, in a way, he was right.  He turned the large pick dick shaped rubber toy over in his hand. “I think this will still work.  It’s got a good base on it.  No balls so you’ll be able to keep it in your ass and walk around no funnier than you do already.  Hey” he asked the Barber who was watching this with great amusement. “Got some hand cream or something I can use as lube?”<br />
Without even looking he reached behind him, picked up a large tube of cream and handed it to the young Latino.<br />
“Gracias” Santos said. “Well, turn around and spread ‘em Pinky.”<br />
Donnie beamed and he turn around, leaning over and bracing his hands on the barber shop chair.  Solid ass high in the air and wide open.  Santos pushed a bit of cream on to the tip of dildo and spread it around.<br />
“You sure you ain’t shaving this ass?  Ya’d think there’s be some hair in here at this point.”<br />
“Yea, I can’t reach around to shove a giant pink rubber cock in my ass but I can do a razor shave on my crack without cutting my balls off.  Get real.”<br />
“Oh, I’ll give you real, Mocco Brain.” Santos said taking the tip of the dildo and pressing into to the pick pucker of Donnie’s ass.  While Matt Vanderville always acted like he has something up his ass, this was the first time something really WAS up is ass.  But then, it wasn’t the first time, for Donnie that is.  Being the slut he was, there were few nights someone’s dick, usually his life long friend Santos’s cock, wasn’t buried up to it’s hilt in his butt.  So when the Frat boys told them they’d have to wear one of these non stop for the length of the hazing, it wasn’t quite like the shocking news most Pledges took it as.  <br />
“OH yea.  Mr. Prostate likes that.” Donnie panted as Santos pushed the dildo in and out a few times.  Donnie’s own real cock started to lengthen and swell.<br />
“Where’d you learn a word like Prostate?”<br />
“I let some Pre Med guys fuck me as freshmen orientation.”<br />
“Bitch.” Santos said giving the dildo a good shove into his buddy’s ass.  Donnie rose off his feet to tip toes for second to take it all.  “Giving football players a bad name, Mio Hijo.  How you gonna be a ‘Tight End’ when your hole is loose enough to take this!”  With that Santos shoved the dildo up to hit’s hilt into Donnie’s ass.  An indention in the plastic let his asshole close around the tip and hold it in place.  A small tab stuck out so that, one day in the future, it could be removed.<br />
Barely able to talk, Donnie turned around and almost smacked his buddy with his giant prick. “You’re turn.”  Donnie dared not even touch his cock for fear of shooting his load over the room.  The 10 inches stood out from his body, solid and deep red.  <br />
“Oh yea, I’ll get it out of the bag.  I was smart enough to buy a real butt plug.” Santos said first lifting the sweat shirt over his head, the pulling the straps down on the singlet to his knees. He bent over, pulled a fairly large butt plug out of his bag and handed it over his shoulder to Donnie.  “Get some of that lube and...” was all Santos could get out before Donnie shoved his cock into his buddy’s ass.  He shoved his plum sized head into the hairy hole without waiting and slowly gave his shaft a good long push in, all in one movement.  “Goddam Donnie!!!”<br />
“That’d be my guess.” Donnie said as he almost pulled out all the way, only to go back in again.  Donnie really had to bend at the knees to get in there, but once the walls were penetrated, he humped like a dog in heat.  Donnie reached around and started stroking Santos off.  The former Gary Calabono’s cock hadn’t grown more than two more inches up to 8, but it was thick as a plantain and dark brown.  It’s dark head rose out of the uncut foreskin with each pump in his ass.  Santos wasn’t as use to getting fucked as Donnie was, and even rarer was it for Donnie to do DOING the fucking.  But the boy knew what he was doing and turn about was rough trade.  With all the excitement it didn’t take Donnie long to shoot his load into his buddy’s butt.  Santos followed soon after.  Still breathing deeply Donnie picked up the butt plug off the floor where Santos had dropped it and without any resistance shoved it up Santos’ ass.  Stepping back Donnie then smacked that right Latino ass cheek so hard his hand print wouldn’t go away for a week.<br />
“Going to have to do that more often.  Dude!  Where’d you get the tat above your ass?” Donnie asked running his finger along the intricately designed tribal tattoo that sat at the top of Santos’ round butt.  <br />
“Some of us get screwed at freshman orientation, some of us get busy else ways.”<br />
“What’s the wrestling coach going to say when he sees it?’<br />
“Don’t know.  Except I got it to make sure he couldn’t miss this ass.”<br />
“Uhh-hmmm” The Barber said clearing his throat.  The two boys looked over shocked, they forgot he was even there.<br />
<br />
“We’re sorry sir, we’ll clean…”<br />
“That’s OK boys, happens all the time.  You can use the bathroom again if you want to clean up?”<br />
“Nah, we’re good.” Donnie said, oblivious to the large stain on front of his shorts and the huge stain in the back of Santos’ thin wrestling singlet.<br />
“You boys know each other I take it?”<br />
“Yes, we’re like brothers.  Well, brothers who fuck.  We grew up together at the orphanage.  This is our first time out really, now that we’re ‘Of Age’ as they say.  But we’ve got scholarships to go to school and there’s nothing that going to break us up.” Santo said slipping his arm around Donnie.  The two locked lips for a good deep kiss.<br />
“And did you boys get those builds by using any steroids or something “<br />
“Hell, no.” Donnie said popping a bicep pose.”100% chemical free.”<br />
“Then what do you call those blonde highlights.” Santos said pulling the sweat shirt back over his head.<br />
“Now who’s the bitch?”<br />
“If you boys come across anyone who wants you to use drugs for competition, what would you do?<br />
“Go to the cops.  They’re our friend.”  <br />
“Good boys.  I think you better be heading off to class.  You come back when ever you feel the need for a trim.  And tell your friends.”<br />
“Dude, you’ve three chairs but I don’t see anyone else working here.  If we tell the wrestling team, the football team and the Frat about you, you’ll be swamped with jocks looking for service.”<br />
<br />
The smile still did not left the Barber’s face long after the two boys left for their new lives.</p>
