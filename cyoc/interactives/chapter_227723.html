<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>There isn&#39;t necessarily &quot;sex&quot; in the chapter... but there are some things that could be taken as &quot;sexual,&quot; and so I went with the closest warning to that.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hug felt wonderful, and it filled Lucy with some of the base emotional joy as her womb brushed against Melody&#39;s and their tails soon coiled around each other. It was a case of mutual emotional support and realistic love that actually made Lucy feel quite happy, as Melody was in many ways different from those Lucy had dated in the past, and not just because Melody was a Slug Woman. And if it weren&#39;t for the shadow of Edward Cupple hanging over the Chapman family and needing to finish college, Lucy really wouldn&#39;t care all that much about the fact that she fell in love with a Slug Woman, had filled that Slug Woman with her own sperm as a Slug Woman, and was carrying that Slug Woman&#39;s eggs within her as well. But those things did happen, and the shadow did exist in the back of her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for caring,&quot; Melody said to Lucy as she laid her head on Lucy&#39;s shoulder, &quot;for I&#39;m sure that issues related to Megan and Jenny don&#39;t set well with you... at least with regard to how you and your family became Slug People.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If Megan and Jenny were enslaved by Cupple, I can forgive them, as Cupple would be the one responsible,&quot; Lucy answered and run one hand down Melody&#39;s right arm feeling the smooth slimy skin and feeling a small smile come to her lips, &quot;It&#39;s more the nervousness over him... finishing college... and the fact that I&#39;m presently pregnant before any of that could be done is what worries me. Partially as mom may be more upset at me not acting responsible... I mean... acting more like Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Jeff protested as he watched the two pregnant Slug Women hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things should be fine... my dad will help prepare things with your mom,&quot; Melody assured Lucy as she rubbed Lucy&#39;s other arm and feeling Lucy&#39;s tail rub at the tip of Melody&#39;s own tail, &quot;some things may not have been planned, but the worst of things should be taken care of. Your mom might be upset over timing... but she should also understand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if anything... that is where I need to thank you,&quot; Lucy answered, &quot;it might make things a bit easier to try and explain why I&#39;m presently full of your eggs and you&#39;re full of mine...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... though, for the moment, we&#39;ll need to begin constructing nests for them,&quot; Melody spoke, &quot;particularly as since we went to sleep after our night of passion... we&#39;re now probably pretty close to laying those eggs. We need to construct something for them to rest in until they hatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy slowly nodded and let Melody pull back from her for a moment. She understood how babies were born and a part of her had even expected being that position someday, going to the hospital to give birth. And while biology classes had made it clear that Slug Women laid eggs, and if impregnated would show signs of that within a matter of hours, it was still something where Lucy had never imagined that she would find herself as a Slug Woman and expecting to lay her first set of eggs in the near future. In this, she had no idea how Slug People handled the preparations for reproduction and all that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t the colony have a hospital or something for that?&quot; Jeff wondered as Melody began to lead Lucy back toward Melody&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;To do what?&quot; Melody asked back, &quot;below the waist, neither of us have any bones and that thus means we don&#39;t have the sorts of complications that humans have that require some external care, be it at home or in a hospital to make sure human babies are born without issue. And while there may be some discomfort in laying the eggs... our eggs are not like a bird or reptile&#39;s egg that will have a hard shell that would add to those issues. They should slide right out and even compress a bit as needed. All that is needed is a relatively moist spot to lay the eggs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... in a bathtub?&quot; Jeff wondered, sounding almost lost and making Melody give a small giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we still need the tub for showering and things like that... it makes sure that anything that might get imbedded in our slime doesn&#39;t stay there,&quot; Melody gave a laugh, though also knowing that neither Jeff nor Lucy likely fully understood this, &quot;the nest for the eggs is largely made from our slime. It will provide all the necessary moisture the eggs need to stay safe until they hatch in a day or so after being laid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... our slime isn&#39;t firm enough to hold something,&quot; Lucy commented as they came into Melody&#39;s room and stopped just shy of the bed, &quot;we leave a bit of a trail, and I&#39;ve noted it&#39;ll spread out a little as we move along... sort of like water would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a bit stickier than water though,&quot; Jeff commented, &quot;as Megan and Jenny&#39;s did kinda stick to us when all this started...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a bit stickier than water, yes,&quot; Melody nodded as she began to coil her tail into as close to a circle as she could beneath her. It wasn&#39;t perfect, as the thicker layers of muscle did provide some limitation on how much the tail could coil, but she did manage and eventually rested the upper part of her tail down onto the top of the part of the tail now coiled underneath her. It lowered Melody&#39;s height relative to Jeff and Lucy, but both of them paid attention as she continued. &quot;A lot of that is also to help us to be able to cling to almost any surface and move along it... even things that would be perfectly smooth and would offer little friction if you were going up a vertical surface...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Megan and Jenny when they came in while you, Mom, Grace, and Zoe were getting breakfast yesterday,&quot; Jeff said to Lucy, &quot;they came in through the outside window... the ones we couldn&#39;t budge when trying to get out of the house the night before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melody ignored that and watched Lucy nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, even with that there are limitations in which our slime wouldn&#39;t conform into a nest for our eggs because of a lot of the ways we use it for basic locomotion,&quot; Melody then continued, &quot;as it can be sticky... but a lot of that can relate to how we control it. And as you moved on your tails, you subconsciously controlled it, even if you didn&#39;t recognize it. Which shows that our slime is not for uncontrolled movement. Some people may slip on it if there is enough of it on the surface they&#39;re walking on, but that&#39;s also with the limitations of having to walk on two feet. And that can be a limitation in nest building...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy nodded and paid more attention, though she also watched as she could see several of the muscles in Melody&#39;s tail begin to contract inward and outward again. It was like Melody was squeezing her tail with her tail, though Lucy could also see that this was also starting to lead to an increase in slime production from Melody&#39;s tail, it also lead to the vent in Melody&#39;s tail at her waist to open. It wasn&#39;t long after that that Melody&#39;s penis began to come into view, and seeing, despite her present gravid womb also began to turn Lucy on. It wasn&#39;t long before her own vent opened and her own penis began to telescope out. At a time, Lucy would have been horrified by this... but as she felt more secure that being a Slug Woman wouldn&#39;t destroy her sense of self, the more willing she was to accept her new form, and the love she could feel from Melody.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we would actually mix our semen with our slime,&quot; Melody spoke, &quot;it is one of the advantages of being a hermaphrodite. We have both sets of organs for reproduction, and that can then help in nest building as the semen when added to our slime will have the effect of something of a gelling agent. Just coil your tail under you like I did... and then contract your tail muscles. That will increase your slime production and hold you to the floor where you are. The slime will then conform inside your coiled tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy slowly began to do the same as she&#39;d seen Melody do. Her muscles restricted the coiling of her tail and it wasn&#39;t a perfect circle, just as what Melody went through, and she felt herself lower down a bit to where her leg was on an even level with Melody&#39;s, and she was looking up with one eye to Jeff. Her other eye remained on Melody, and she could begin to see precum emerge from the tip of Melody&#39;s penis as it then slipped down into the area where Melody was collecting her slime. Lucy also noted that it also came as Melody&#39;s penis rubbed at the underside of Melody&#39;s own gravid womb with each squeezing pulse in Melody&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a lot of it will be instinctive,&quot; Melody continued and will happen automatically, &quot;contracting the muscles in your tail to release more slime, combined with the position you&#39;re in now, will provide something a stirring sensation to your penis and you&#39;ll just begin to drip precum into the slime. That mixture will then form a gel that will be soft and moist enough to protect your eggs and will be firm enough it won&#39;t just disperse everywhere when you release your tail. Once it comes to just below where your vagina is... the nest will be complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy followed the instruction to constrict the muscles in her tail, like she was hugging herself from the outside to in. It sent sensations going all through her tail and she could feel more slime begin to pour out of every pore in her tail. The constrictions in her tail then shook her erect penis which then rubbed against the bottom of her womb. It felt good and it wasn&#39;t long before she could feel her own precum begin to drip out and into the slime that would be the nest for her eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I need to stir anything?&quot; Lucy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... the mixture will happen naturally,&quot; Melody answered, &quot;and it won&#39;t be long before we have nests for our eggs.&quot;</p>
