<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria walked out of her room and began to walk down the hall. She noticed her walking became a little harder. When she looked down she saw that she was gaining weight! Her belly was expanding and her breast became a little heavier. Her phanny became a little bulkier and sagged down. She had gained about fifty pounds! Her clothes changed as she now wore a white T-shirt with exposed her aged and saggy breasts, a blue sweater with buttons, pink yoga pants, which showed her aged phanny, and a pair of green and white tennis shoes. When she noticed these changes she became angry and upset. <br />
“What the hell” <br />
she said in a much heavier and withered voice. She walked to the elevator and headed down to the lobby where she walked to reception. She began to demand answers to why she aged further then she wanted to. The lady told her that maybe she thought about being seventy five when she exited the room without realizing. The receptionist told her this happens. She tried to think of herself as a 60 year old once again, but nothing happened. She asked the lady why she wasn’t changing back. The lady replied<br />
 “ Guests can only change there age in their rooms.” <br />
<br />
Gloria didn’t know what to do. She now looked as if she could be someone’s grandmother and dressed like one too. She didn’t bother going back to her room, but rather embraced her new self. She stepped away from reception and began to look for some new activities that would best suit her elderly age. While she was walking to the senior division she saw a young toddler no more then two years old. <br />
“Hello little man, I’m Gloria, what’s your name?”<br />
Said Gloria. The boy looked up and said<br />
“My name is Thomas, and I haven’t gotten a caretaker yet to help me.” <br />
Said the boy. Gloria felt that this was her opportunity to step in. <br />
“I can’t be your care taker if you want, I can help bathe you, feed you, and change your big poo poos in your little diapie! Would you like that?” <br />
Said Gloria. The boy looked at her and replied<br />
“Yes please, can you be my grandma while we’re like this” <br />
“Well of course I can! Now where do you want to go?” <br />
Said Gloria. The boy excitedly replied <br />
“ let’s go to the park!” <br />
Gloria agreed and picked the toddler up resting his diapered but on her arm. As the two were walking Gloria noticed some aches in her back. She decided to stop and gently put the toddler down. She asked the receptionist if they could bring a stroller for her, and *POOF* a stroller appeared right indolent of her. <br />
“Wow that’s amazing! Now let’s put your little tushy in here and head to the park.”<br />
Gloria said. The boy happily agreed as Gloria picked him up and put him in the stroller. They got to the park and Gloria let the boy go in th playground where she could watch him. She rested her big butt on a bench which felt amazing. The relief from standing sent a wave of relaxation. After about 20 minutes Thomas came back to Gloria and asked if he could sit on her lap and rest. She picked up the boy and rested him on her lap. Gloria fell asleep as Thomas just sat there and relaxed. A few moments later Thomas realized he needed to go number two. <br />
“ I need to make poo poo!”<br />
He said as he grabbed his stomach. He slipped off Gloria’s lap and squatted on the ground. He began to grunt and push as poop slid out his butt and landed in his diaper. The diaper was filling up quick and when it was over his diaper was noticeably sagging and had a very pungent odor. After he was finished he climbed on to the bench and sat back down on Gloria’s lap. Gloria the. Woke up and began to sniff the air.<br />
“Uh oh! I think I smell a poopy in your diapie.” Said Gloria. She then lifted Thomas noticing the big bulge and sag that the poop had caused. The pressed her hand against the back of his diaper.<br />
“That’s a big poo poo in there. I cannot believe you made all that!” <br />
Said. The boy giggled. Gloria began to sit up when she got a wiff of another smelly odor. It smelled like poop, but where was it coming from? She looked around and saw nobody else. She the. Sat up and turned around to see a big brown mark on her pink yoga pants! <br />
“How did I? When did I?” <br />
Said Gloria. An assistant of the resort walked over and asked if she needed help with her problem. Gloria reluctantly said yes slaloming the last of her youthful pride. With a snap of her fingers the assistant had changed Gloria’s pink yoga pants. Glora was relieved until she went a soft padding between her now fat thighs. <br />
“Did I just gain more weight”<br />
Thought Gloria. She looked behind her and in her pink yoga pants was now a big padded adult diaper. the assistant walked away and said <br />
“ if you ever make another mess, an assistant will appear and change you”<br />
Gloria accepted this and went to go back and change her toddlers diaper. She realized she had no diapers and needed to go to the day care to get more. She picked up Thomas and turned around to put him in his stroller, but it was gone. She overheard people saying that the Park was closed and all items had been returned to reception including the stroller. She then hoisted Thomas up to her waist with his head resting against her old lady breast wilhich were wrinkled and saggy, but were held up by her girlde which gave Thomas some head support. He hand was underneath his very poopy diaper which made Thomas feel comfortable and happy. They began to walk away as she said some toddlerish things to him. <br />
“Look who made poo poo in his diapie! What a good toddler you are.” As she said this thomas made some more grunts. She heard some farts and then realized he had once again pooped his already dirty diaper. <br />
“Hopefully they have enough diapers for all your messes! <br />
Gloria giggled.</p>
