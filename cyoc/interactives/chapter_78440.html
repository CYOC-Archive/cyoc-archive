<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott had to wait till Saturday to enact his plan.  He had invited both his best friend Jake and his girlfriend Sandra over for a movie marathon.  Well, that was what he told them anyway.  But the days gave him time to prepare.  He stripped aside the rug in his living room, and used a stick of chalk to draw on the floor.  The book had a complex diagram, but he took every effort to make sure it was perfect.  Ever line was in place, every symbol was drawn just right.  He carefully rolled the rug back over the circle, concealing it from sight.<br />
<br />
Saturday came and Scott had everything set up just right.  A stack of DVDs, supposedly for watching, a bowl of freshly popped popcorn, and a six pack of beers.  Beers that he had opened and specially treated.  Jake and Sandra both sat on the couch, casually talking with one another.  Scott was in the kitchen, nervously pacing.  He wasn't sure it was going to work, he was having second thoughts.  He shook his head and grabbed the two beers.  It was now or never.  He popped the caps and walked back into the living room.  He handed one to each of them, and started to retreat to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Jake piped up suddenly in his deep voice.  Scott loved Jake's voice.  &quot;Joining us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just getting one for myself.&quot;  Scott backed into the kitchen, turning over his shoulder to see both of them sipping from the bottles.  He waited to the count of ten and peered back into the living room.  Sure enough, the special brew had done its job.  Both of them were passed out on the couch, Sandra slumped up against Jake.  He figured he had about an hour and set to work.<br />
<br />
He dragged them both off the couch.  Sandra was light and easy to move.  Jake was larger than he was and it took some effort to get the jock off the couch and onto the floor.  He tore back the rug, revealing his magic circle.  He gave it one more once over.  Making sure everything was right.<br />
<br />
Jake was first.  Scott started to strip his best friend naked, his cock swelling in his pants as he did.  Jake was an athletic sort, always running, or hitting the gym.  And it showed.  Scott peeled off Jake's shirt, revealing his firm pectorals and taught six pack.  A dusting of light brown hair grew up his torso, spreading across his chest.  He let his hands trace down Jake's body, to the waistband of his jeans.  He undid the fly, holding his breath before pulling it down.  He had been trying to catch a peek of Jake's cock for years now.  But even at the gym it had been difficult.  Jake was apparently shy about showing it off.  He tugged down on the jeans and boxers, sliding Jake's cock and ass free.  When Scott finally caught sight of it, he couldn't help but wonder why Jake was so shy.  He had an uncircumsized cock, easily 5 inches long in its flaccid state, with a pair of plump balls, nestled in a trimmed patch of brown pubes.  He slid the pants the rest of the way down, and off along with his shoes.  He looked over the nude Jake, admiring the view for a moment.  He bent over and stole a kiss, something else he had wanted to do for years.  He struggled to lift Jake again, the feeling of touching his bare flesh sending tingles through his body.  He placed his unconcious body in the circle, setting his limbs spread eagle.  Each hand went to one of the symbols, and did each foot, and of course his head.<br />
<br />
Next came Sandra.  Undressing her was entirely different from undressing Jake.  Where one he had never undressed before, the other he had done so many times.  He tenderly stripped Sandra of her shirt, running his hands along her smooth bare skin.  The clasp on her bra was quickly undone.  He cupped her breasts in his hand, giving them one last feel as they were.  Her skirt was similarly easy to undo, stripped off in a matter of seconds.  He smoothed out her long black hair, admiring her pale skin, smooth and hairless.  He kissed her on the lips, planting kisses down along her body, just as she loved him to do on their intimate nights together.  He picked her up, her petite form light in his arms.  He set her down atop Jake, lining her limbs up with his.  Her head rested under Jake's chin, and her hands and feet didn't quite reach his. But the positioning was perfect.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his spell book, flipping to the right page and read the next part again.  He had to connect them.  More than just skin to skin contact.  He thought he understood what the unclear phrase meant.  He lowered his head down between their legs.  He opened his mouth and ran his tongue along Jake's cock.  The response was almost immediate.  The limp shaft plumping with blood.  He opened his mouth and wrapped his lips around the head.  He sucked at his best friend's cock, running his tongue along the shaft until it was as hard as he could get it.  As impressive as it was flaccid, the shaft was easily over eight inches when hard.  Scott's own cock was straining tight against his jeans.  He grabbed Jake's cock, and with a little work maneuvered it towards Sandra, sliding it inside her slit.  They both let out a small moan and Scott froze, waiting to see if they'd wake up.  When nothing happened he slid her further down on Jake's cock, until it didn't seem she could take anymore.<br />
<br />
He stood up and grabbed the book, holding it spread open in his hands.  He began to read the incantation.  It sounded like nonsense to his ears, but as soon as the words began to leave his mouth, he noticed things happening to the pair.  Their flesh started to flow into each other.  Melding together where they touched.  IT looked like Sandra was sinking into Jake.  Even where the cock had entered her, her vagina looked to have sealed around the cock, trapping it inside her.  Her hands and feet sunk into Jake's arms and legs, his muscles tensing.  Sandra's previously smooth crotch began to grow curly black hairs.  Her head rolled back as it slowly suck into Jake's neck, her hair disappearing completely inside of him.  Jake's blond hair darkened at the roots, going from blond, to brown and on to black.  The darker color creeped up his hair, even pushing it out a few extra inches, turning his short crew cut into a shaggy black mop.  The hair along his jaw darkened, his previously hard to notice blond stubble turning an inky black.<br />
<br />
Scott kept up his chanting, but he was finding it harder and harder as he watched the changes progress.  Her breasts began to slowly shrink, though her nipple shrank a bit, they got no smaller than the size of a quarter.  Scott had always liked large nipples.  Around the nipples, black hair began to grow in, as well as in th center of her chest.  Her chest swelled, though not into breasts, her muscles were growing.  Her limbs were sinking into Jake, but his torso seemed to be pushing into her.  Her stomach lost some of its feminine curves, a taught six pack forming.<br />
<br />
Sandra's limbs had completely disappeared, her pale skin disappearing into Jake's more tanned flesh.  All that remained was her face and torso, though her torso was looking distinctly more masculine.  Jake's cock was being pulled up between Sandra's legs, their flesh merging together, smooth and unbroken.  His balls began to migrate upwards as her pelvis sank into his.  Behind Jake's balls, the skin between his legs started to split apart, slowly unfurling into a pair of lips.  A perfect copy of Sandra's vagina now between Jake's legs.  The flesh along Sandra's crotch up to her navel buldged.  A ridge of hard flesh that started to take on a familiar form.  The ridge seperated, springing up into Jake's eight inch cock which had disappeared only moments before.  Both their genitals placed perfectly between their now merged legs.<br />
<br />
Black hair continued to grow along Sandra's torso, a thick black treasure trail leading up to the dark hair spread along her pectorals.  The rest of her torso sunk into Jake, merging together seemlessly.  Their combined torso, despite Jake being heavily built, and seemingly adding Sandra's body to his own had instead shrunk a little.  They were a little less bulky than Jake had been, but still lean and athletically toned.  Loooking them over, despite the mostly male look, he could see where their forms had melded.  A mole on the hip he had always kissed when making love to Sandra.  The healthy tan Jake has worked so hard to keep.  Only their faces remained apart.<br />
<br />
He started to chant the last words to the spell, a wet spot spreading along the front of his jeans.  His cock so hard it was painful.  Sandra's head disappeared inside of Jake.  Jake's features began to shift about, melding Sandra's with his own.  His heavy nose lost some of its beakishness, the end turning slightly upwards.  His eyes brightened from brown to Sandra's dark blue.  Even his cheek bones bcame just a little bit sharper.  He finished chanting, setting the book aside and surveying his handiwork.  While Sandra and Jake hasn't looked anything alike to start with.  Either could have claimed the combined figure infront of him as a sibling and he would have believed them.  Mostly male in form, with his dusting of body hair and stubble.  He could wear clothes and pass as a man easily.  But his nipples were a bit larger than most men would have, and then there was the matter of the vagina between his legs, behind his cock.  Both genitals, whet Scott had been after from the beginning.  A guy he could hang out with, but also someone he could cuddle and make love to in all the ways he wanted.<br />
<br />
He laid down next to his creation, resting his hand on the rigid shaft, caressing it as he worked his hand down to the slit, sliding his fingers inside.  Perfect indeed.  &quot;Wake up, Sam.&quot;  He had decided on the name himself, and according to the book, it should take.<br />
<br />
Sam's eyes fluttered open and looked right at Scott.  &quot;Hey, handsome.&quot;  Same placed his hand behind Scott's head, pulling him in for a kiss.  He tensed his cunt around Scott's fingers.  &quot;Eager, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott was giddy.  There was no memory of the two ever being separate.  They were like one person.  &quot;You have no idea.&quot;</p>
