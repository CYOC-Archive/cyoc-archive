<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While you're left alone in your room you start to really think about what you are now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just drank blood through fangs and I liked it&quot; you say surprised. &quot;If this is a hallucination then it's one hell of a hallucination. I'm getting this sense that this isn't a hallucination though. I've had a hallucination before and this doesn't feel like one. I know I was freaked at first and was looking for an explanation other than what Sarah gave me. As more time goes by I'm pretty much forced to accept that I really am a vampire. I'm still having trouble adjusting to the reality that I'm a girl now but I should be used to it before long. Sarah said that there was writing material in the desk. Perhaps I should write down what I<br />
experience in case we are wiped out. Yes, I think I will do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You go over to the desk and see a catalog with the dress you're wearing on the front. &quot;So&quot; you say, &quot;this dress is velvet and taffeta and it's from some place called The Pyramid Collection. You know, I wonder if these gold colored shoes that I'm wearing are in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You open the catalog and right on the second page with the dress you're wearing is the gold silk slip ons. You continue to look through the catalog to see what else you can find. You find several things that catch your eye that you would like. After you have looked through the catalog you look in the desk for the writing materials. You pull those materials out and are just about to start when you feel a pressure building like you have to pee. &quot;I guess I still need to eliminate waste like a human. Well I guess I<br />
should go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You head to the bathroom through the curtains Sarah had indicated. Once inside the bathroom you see that it's decorated in black and purple. It's a nice bathroom with a black bathtub that you can lay down in and be submerged in water. You pull up the bottom of your dress, pull your panties down, and sit down on the toilet. Peeing as a girl was different then peeing as a guy. After you finish you<br />
remember to wipe as you had heard that girls could develop an infection if they didn't wipe. You wonder why that doesn't apply to males too. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that most guys are circumcised. You decide that it really didn't matter much why there was a difference, you just need to wipe when you pee and that's<br />
all you really need to know. You wash your hands and leave the bathroom.<br />
<br />
You had written about half of what happened to you since last night when Sarah came back into your room. She looked agitated and she kept looking around the room like she expected someone to be there.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did anyone ask to come in?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything in here that wasn't here before?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
You look around trying to see if there was anything that wasn't here before. Your eyes rest on a plain pen on the desk. You didn't see it there before and you had been using a quill. Besides, that plain pen looked out of place in this room.<br />
<br />
&quot;The BIC pen on the desk wasn't there before&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn't invite anyone to come in?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; you say a bit perplexed.<br />
<br />
Sarah grabbed the BIC pen from the desk and broke it in half. She then threw the the pieces against one wall. You are astounded to see the pieces turn to mist and that mist reform into a boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing in here Brian?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie told me to come here but to stay out of sight&quot; Brian said. &quot;I guess I didn't stay out of sight that well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I had seen someone enter&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You said that Julie told you to come here so, you won't mind if I call her to verify that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah went over to the phone and dialed a number. After chatting for a little bit she hung it up and said &quot;My apologies Brian. Julie did inform me that she told you to come here to keep an eye on my daughter. I guess I should introduce you two. Brian, this is my daughter Violet. Violet, this is Brian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a pen&quot; you say with a surprised look on your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can transform into more than just mist&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you do that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to learn how to turn to mist first&quot; Sarah said. &quot;After you learn that you'll be able to transform into anything you touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When will you be teaching me to turn to mist?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just as soon as we have lunch&quot; Sarah says. &quot;I took the liberty of getting you a club salad with ranch dressing, a dish of strawberry jello, and B positive blood. It should be here any time now. You can go get lunch Brian but Julie want's you back here immediately after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be back&quot; Brian said. He turned to mist and left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you notice him there before?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; you say. &quot;I didn't notice until you asked me if I noticed anything out of place. He was right under my nose and I didn't see him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't think I need to say much more except that you need to pay more attention&quot; Sarah said. &quot;There are other vampires that can turn to mist and become objects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try to pay more attention&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
There was a chime from the phone and Sarah went over and pushed a button. She then said &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have your lunch here&quot; an unfamiliar voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be right out to get it&quot; Sarah said. She pushed the button again then said &quot;I'll be right back.&quot; She turned to mist and left the room.<br />
<br />
A few moments later Sarah reformed carrying a tray. &quot;Here's lunch&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
You sit down to eat at a table you did't notice before. &quot;This table wasn't here before&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;This table has been here all the time&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You were so freaked out before that you just didn't notice it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a day&quot; you say as you start to eat your salad. You eat your lunch while making some small talk. You find out that you were the first one that Sarah turned in her 200 years as a vampire. The one that turned her is still alive at 450 years though living in another city. Sarah is a member of a council that governs the clan in each city. You have this room because of this fact. The members of this<br />
council are elected by the clan in the city until they decide to retire. Sarah said that there is one vampire on the council here that has been on it for 100 years.<br />
<br />
You finish lunch and Sarah calls to have the tray picked up. She takes the tray outside then comes back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we going to start now?&quot; you ask excited. It was really confusing to turn to mist but you're eager to try to do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok we'll start now&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now remember that it takes a couple days for most new vampires to learn how to turn to mist and stay that way. It takes concentration and focus to do it. What you want to do is concentrate on your body and cloths becoming mist. Try it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say as you concentrate on your body and clothes becoming mist. You feel yourself getting lighter and then you're seeing in 360 degree vision from multiple points. You succeed in keeping your concentration for about a second then you lose it and automatically reform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad for your first attempt&quot; Sarah said. &quot;In fact you were able to turn to mist on your first try which is something that most can't do until their fifth attempt.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment Brian came back in and said &quot;I'm sorry I scared you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ok Brian&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Besides, you gave Violet a lesson in being more aware. You were right under her nose and she didn't notice you. I should explain something to you Violet. The reason I was mad with Brian is that there is a rule here that no one can enter someone's room without being invited. Of course if a member of the council tells you to go into a room you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you started training her to turn to mist?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I have and she was able to turn into mist on her first try&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great&quot; Brian said, &quot;it took me three attempts to turn to mist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok enough of this talk&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Try again Violet and keep in mist form for as long as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
You concentrate on turning your body and clothes into mist. You remain as mist for about six seconds this time then you lose your concentration and reform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're improving&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You went from one second to six seconds. Now do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the next few hours Sarah has you turn to mist over and over. Each time you're able to increase the time you can stay as mist. You also find that it gets easier to keep your concentration on staying as mist while taking in what you see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you can reform now Violet&quot; Sarah said as you hit one hour being mist.<br />
<br />
You consider seeing how long you can remain as mist like Sarah had said. You sense that Sarah is very proud of you and you don't want to make her mad so you let your concentration go and reform.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've done very well&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you have me reform after an hour?&quot; you ask. &quot;I felt like I could go on longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have gone on for hours more&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You see, once you reach an hour staying as mist it becomes so easy that you can remain that way for days. Now we'll work on moving as mist. I think that you'll be able to do it on your first try so we'll skip just moving around. Instead I want you to turn to mist, move to your bed, sit on it, and reform.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to mist and then think about going to your bed and sitting down. When you are comfortable that you are sitting on your bed you reform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good Violet&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now I want to see if you can exit the room on your own. I'll go out first and you follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say as Sarah leaves. You turn to mist and head toward the wall with the crack in it. It takes you just a little bit to find the crack but spreading out along the wall helped you locate it quicker. You move through that crack and reform in front of Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;You came out sooner than I thought you would&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I spread out along the wall to find the crack quicker&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you are the first to do that to my knowledge&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Let's go back in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once inside Brian asks &quot;How did she do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She located the crack quickly by spreading herself out over the wall&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
You decide to try something. You concentrate on changing just a little bit of your hair into a little droplet of water. You once again see things in 360 degrees and how you normally see. You send the drop out through the crack and look up and down the hall. You see other vampires reforming and heading to the doors. &quot;Why is everyone headed upstairs?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is time for supper&quot; Brian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know everyone is going upstairs?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see them in the hall&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I turned a little bit of my hair to a droplet and sent it out to the hall&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you just did this?&quot; Sarah asked with a surprised look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wondered if it was possible and decided to try it&quot; you say. &quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't do anything wrong&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Very few vampires can use that technique and then not after many years of practice. Can you still see out in the hall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I can&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is highly unusual&quot; Sarah says, &quot;you can use a very advanced technique on your first day. Not only that but no one told you about this technique.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does this mean?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it means that Violet can learn any mist technique&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Well we should be getting to dinner too. Violet, when we get out into the hall I want you to be whole. That means no tiny bits of yourself floating as mist. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Sarah&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You head to dinner and you do as Sarah said.</p>
