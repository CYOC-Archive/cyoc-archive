<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>My recommendation for the choices at the bottom concerning Teri&#39;s new form is to leave room for increased power and further outlandish (read: more powerful) alterations of the body.  You know, if you plan to keep her a succubus.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sentence read: &quot;In Forester&#39;s lavatory, an assertive woman in a form-fitting red dress knows exactly what she&#39;ll do next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; She grinned wickedly. &quot;I do.&quot;  She tapped on the phone, going with her original thought from a moment earlier.  That being &#39;what was sexually more assertive than a succubus?&#39;  <i>Probably nothing?</i><br />
<br />
She kept that smile she had, and swapped &#39;woman&#39; for &#39;succubus&#39;.  Waiting zero seconds on the confirmation prompt, Teri hit &#39;Execute&#39; and the world <i>felt</i> wrong for a fraction of an instant...<br />
<br />
To the universe, most would not have noticed a major change.  But this phone app (PA) created a world of a powerful spell that transcended a single reality and made our mostly mundane earth its playground.  As if physical existence could manifest a loading bar, Teri had enough realization that, though she was not an atheist, the world had been without a true god an instant earlier.<br />
<br />
Indeed, now there was whole pantheon, for real.  God or gods now existed, as greater and lesser demons, and imps, and all manor of corrupted spirits.  In that brief instant focused outward from Teri herself, she ceased to be a non-believer because she had literally created everyone&#39;s beliefs.  In that moment, she knew as a lesser demon, she would be hunted by shadowy organizations of faithful.  She would have to fend off her own kind for territory and power.<br />
<br />
All this in that moment came to her, as did her entire backstory, revised a second time that very day:<br />
<br />
Teri Gibson kept getting turned down for jobs even with a degree in business.  In her case, it hadn&#39;t been exclusively because she was a woman because when she&#39;d been Terry Gibson that morning, and the story was true for him too.  Everyone was struggling to get a good job, and she was three weeks late on her rent.<br />
<br />
With the help of her fellow downtrodden Carlos and Jacque, they devised a plan to turn their lives around.  For Teri, it was to become powerful and rich in the business world and make something in her life.  But, unbeknownst to her, Carlos and Jacque each simply wanted to get laid... to have one night of unparalleled sexual gratification.<br />
<br />
While the three had procured the necessary ingredients for their summoning spell, they had not fully read the book that Jacque had swiped from the basement of the church one town over.  Well, Teri had read the book, but not Jacque or Carlos.  Teri was a business major, after all, and if there was any chance to keep your soul in a deal with a summoned demon, it was to be able to know how to make a proper contract.<br />
<br />
It had saved her life, she recalled.  Summoned inside of a properly formed salt circle, the cartoonishly shaped, yet devilishly appearing demon asked for a soul for payment.  With Carlos and Jacque on the same page, they had agreed to the shape of a woman that would fit both their tastes.  And at point of payment, they shoved Teri through the barrier and sacrificed her soul for their own gain.<br />
<br />
Or so they had thought...<br />
<br />
For you see, Teri had drawn the circle and said the proper latin phrases.  And, neither man knew Teri had in her pocket a parchment written in her own blood, stipulating the terms of a deal should her companions break their word.  Words were binding in this new world, and breaking you word was a powerful slight.<br />
<br />
Their deals were broken, Jacque and Carlos, as would their spirits be.  The demon took offense to all but Teri, Teri who had made a proper pact, signed in blood, gave up not her own soul but 60% each of the souls of her two business partners, resulting in a transaction of 120% soul for the demon and not enough for a happy life on it&#39;s own for either of the two betrayers.<br />
<br />
Teri&#39;s gain for this deal was simple: the power and energy and will needed to best all others to be manifest when she asserted the desire to put her own faults behind her.  And that construct, almost brought her into the present.<br />
<br />
As for Carlos and Jacque, they sought protection from Teri now.  Their lives were less-so as human souls like theirs were very poor at regaining their strength without a strong will.  She could call on them for favors, but seeing them dead was not in Teri&#39;s desires.  Punished?  Sure.  But not dead.  Without most of their respective souls their only path back to wholeness was staying in the good graces of a powerful supernatural.<br />
<br />
Something like what Terri would be.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a perfect plan.  Teri hadn&#39;t detailed how exactly she&#39;d come to power which resulted in the demon infusing her with demon energies in a shape resembling the two men&#39;s carnal desires.  She would be a succubus, and history was now written that the indecisive mind that accompanied her new nature was how the demon tried to get out of proper payment.  Were it not for the PA allowing her to force her own assertiveness, she might never have properly manifest.<br />
<br />
But the way the PA had rewritten reality made it all come to ahead in this bathroom.  For the passed few weeks, Teri had maintained a common life, using a glamor she had picked up from the early pages of the book Jacques had stolen.  To everyone else, she looked like Teri, but the truth was more than that.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d was a succubus, but one in a kind of protoplasmic state hiding inside the fake, skin-like shell shaped like her old human body.  A larva, of sorts, in a cocoon that moved and talked like she was still a regular person.  It would only be when she asserted herself in her true nature that her form would manifest fully.  And here she had, and now it did.<br />
<br />
That was an instant ago now... reality shifting around Teri Gibson.  In the previous life, Carlos and Jacque had been roommates in her shitty studio apartment all making rent barely work on their crappy paying jobs.  In this new reality, she&#39;d thrown them out because they just wouldn&#39;t stop alternating between begging for sex or help with getting parts of their souls back.  They knew she was the best chance to restore them, but until she could properly manifest, she had no real power, and they were annoying her.<br />
<br />
In this new world virginity had a real power... a one-time-break seal on pent-up sexual energies... and reality had not shifted to make Teri lose hers.  It didn&#39;t mean much at her age, so she could chunk it.  But if she managed to keep it, it could be a powerful bargaining chip decades or centuries later.  As the book told it, oral, anal, vaginal, and penile all counted separate with &#39;purity&#39; bonus of sorts for keeping all four.<br />
<br />
But she already planned to lose one tonight, because she was a woman on a mission... business and power in at least this venture capital firm, maybe more, and maybe beyond this world into others.  Who knew... but she was assertive and had ambitions and would go wherever her powerful wings would take her.<br />
<br />
But first, it was time to make Mr. Forester her toy and get that job.  She&#39;d be partner inside of a year, and the first woman at the firm to hold that position.  It probably just meant she&#39;d have to suck a few dicks to do it and as of these moments, she knew she could and would... sucking out a bit of soul as she did so.<br />
<br />
Teri&#39;s eyes beheld her true form in the mirror.  While the glamor she had on had made her &#39;perfect&#39; in the eyes of both partners, her true size and shape was not an hourglass figure with DD-cup breasts, plump lips, long blonde hair, notable camel-toe, and tear-drop-shaped ass.  That was the old her.  She wasn&#39;t a tomboy anymore, nor that blonde, nor even human.<br />
<br />
She was Teri Gibson, a neonate succubus who looked like...</p>
