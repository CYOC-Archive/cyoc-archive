<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Andrew and Basil made their way to the cafeteria where they get their own plate of food. Pizza is, of course, today&#39;s special, Basil predictability decides to fill his plate up with fives slices of pepperoni pizza [filling his plate full], Andrew was about to stop his friend until he saw label, reading the sign it says &#39;with organic Pepperoni&#39;. Normally Andrew would&#39;ve been irritated by that fact, but for once he&#39;s glad for it, Andrew didn&#39;t want to hear the &#39;No eating meat&#39; spat from his new friend that he grew tired of hearing. He didn&#39;t want to hear it from a former Satyr especially.<br />
<br />
Although, it made Andrew wonder, now that he and Basil can shift between human and satyr. Would that mean that Andrew can&#39;t eat meat anymore? Before all this happened, he ate his fair amount of meat. Like burgers, tacos, and steak. Not that he&#39;s fat [like his new roommate], but he worry that the magic also changed his lifestyle a bit, his diet may have change with it.<br />
&#39;I should experiment if I can still eat meat or not.&#39; Andrew making a mental note for himself. He made himself a plate with only two slices, and he had to pay for both his and Basil&#39;s meal. [Since Basil still needs to understand how money works, he&#39;s from outside the country after all. Or so says this reality.]<br />
<br />
Now usually Andrew would&#39;ve been with his other friends but their table is already full, and he needed to talk to Basil with just the two of them anyway. So after settling down, Andrew started the discussion. &quot;It really does feel like you have always been here isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Basil took a moment to respond. &quot;Yeah... But did everyone here forget, or were their memories replaced?&quot; Andrew realized that, while they do remember their new memories, they didn&#39;t forget their old ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well for us, WE didn&#39;t forget. In fact it feels like its more or less that the magic added these memories rather than replace them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... you&#39;re right! But why is it day time here, and night time in my world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beats me... I guess time flows differently depending on the portal. Sort of like Narnia...&quot; The words came out before Andrew thought twice. Basil was confused and he asked. &quot;What&#39;s Narnia?&quot; Andrew just realized that it would not be so smart to tell him more about this story. He doesn&#39;t know how he would feel about how satyrs are represented outside of his world. It may not be a good idea at all. Andrew brush that off by saying...<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you about later. Just know that time may not share the same logic as the magic&#39;s logic. &#39;Time is an illusion&#39;, or so I was told.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Okay then.&quot; Basil sounded as if he&#39;s not liking the answer. though, it&#39;s not that Andrew would blame him, it&#39;s still a weird theory, but it&#39;s something, and it may not even be correct.<br />
<br />
Andrew was about to continue, but then Basil stomach growled and he ask. &quot;Can it wait? I really need to eat, And I want to try this pizza! I&#39;m starving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew accepted defeat and agreed. Eat first talk later.<br />
____________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Basil wastes no time on taking a bite out of his first pizza. He was amazed about the taste of it all. Andrew couldn&#39;t imagine what that must&#39;ve felt like for him. Andrew ate his very first pizza at an age he couldn&#39;t remember clearly. While he ate, he studies Basil while he enjoys his food.<br />
<br />
In retrospect; back at the painting. He was a fat satyr with such curly brown fur with a body like a sumo wrestler. His arms thick with both muscle and fat, his goat legs those muffin top of a rump of his; are also thick with enough muscles to carry his weight, his belly also hangs over his pelvis, with moobs hangs on top of the belly. Oh! and how can anyone forget that being part goat his belly too is also covered in fur. And his face is round with a double chin that sports a goatee. Like all male satyrs have. Also Andrew didn&#39;t realized this at the time, but Basil did have his own set of ram horns as dark as his hair which explains that he never notice them.<br />
<br />
He did wore a necklace with big beads, a too small vest making his belly look bigger than what it technically is. And lastly he wears a loincloth not that he needs it, but he wears it like a proud satyr.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then after that, his body changed when they got back to Andrew&#39;s world, making him human with some weight lost. That&#39;s not to say that he&#39;s skinny now. He still has a body of a sumo wrestler, but his body holds enough muscles to show he can in fact; Be strong enough to pull his weight despite his size.<br />
<br />
As for his clothes. He wears a kilt, a full-torso-covering vest with the university logo as a badge and a T-shirt underneath, and lastly he was given simple loafers. Now he looks like any other person in campus. In fact, the clothes he got would be the type of clothes he could put on by himself.<br />
<br />
Of course, unlike Andrew who had a more of a goat like of a face (with a thick goatee) when he turn into a satyr. And when he got back, his face went back to what it was (With no goatee). But with Basil he looks the same. He even still has his own goatee. It&#39;s like as if his facial hair is a part of his own identity.<br />
<br />
In any case, Andrew watched him eating. Which of course is making him blush, why does that make him so excited? He can&#39;t be into him in that way, can he? And even if he is, it&#39;s not like he feels the same way either. Basil is probably into women, or at the very least he&#39;s not into dating anyone period.<br />
<br />
And when he looks at his phone, he saw additional pictures and videos in his phone, they look like corny videos of him and Basil goofing off and having fun. They really do act like brothers, except they&#39;re actually Roommates. Even still, they did enjoy and annoy each other and yet they still coexist.<br />
<br />
Basil is now on his last two pieces and this time, he&#39;s putting both slices together with the top parts colliding; he&#39;s eating them both like a pizza sandwich.<br />
<br />
So Andrew shakes his head, he went back to eating his pizza.<br />
+_________________________________________________+<br />
<br />
<br />
Basil finally finish his lunch and gave such ah hearty burp. Andrew embarrassed, looks around to see if anyone cares. Well only few gave them stares, but for the most part nobody cared. Andrew finish his lunch as well. With their drinks left to finish, they began to talk. Andrew states.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Basil...&quot; He begins by asking. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?... Oh the Pizza! I love it Andrew! I can definitely see why you humans love it!&quot; Basil gave such a toothy grin, it makes him look like a very satisfied puppy. &quot;I&#39;ll be looking forward to- *burp* to trying every food that you people eat!&quot; Andrew waves both of his hands to calm him down. &#39;Yeah as long as it not meat.&#39; Andrew thinks to himself. Even if he could eat meat, he doesn&#39;t want to see Basil feel guilty about it after the fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes well...&quot; Andrew continues. &quot;What about...&quot; He whispers. &quot;about you being human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh; well...&quot; Basil gave it a bit more thought to his answer. &quot;It&#39;s... It is actually really good... I want to explore more about your world. I&#39;m happy that I met you!&quot; Andrew was happy for him. As he thinks. &#39;Even though I never intended to bring him with me, I&#39;m glad that I did. He does deserve to be here. And as long as I&#39;m his Roommate I&#39;ll try to keep him out of trouble!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was... Interesting.&quot; Basil stated with little confidences. He feels like he got what he wanted, and yet; he still doesn&#39;t have enough to be satisfied. Andrew notice the doubt in Basils voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Basil? You sound like you&#39;re not happy to be here.&quot; Basil looked up to face him and reassures that he is happy to be here. &quot;It&#39;s just that...&quot; Basil continues. &quot;I felt trapped in my own home, not able to feel like I can be myself without control, like with anyone and every satyr acting odd around me. But when I&#39;m here; It feels as though there&#39;s still some from of control here in this world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew rolled his eyes at that. &#39;Great! I brought home an activist. Like we don&#39;t have enough of those!&#39; He thought to himself. &quot;But Basil; This is what school-... I mean; Collages are. You can&#39;t learn anything if there&#39;s no order. And besides; You can still do anything here. As long as you follow their rules.&quot; Basil cocked his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Basil then starts questioning his &#39;so-called&#39; free will. &quot;So what does a former Satyr like me can do in a place like this? Besides eating food like pizzas.&quot; Andrew thought for a moment and gave some examples like... Playing baseball, basketball, football, soccer, or with his type of a body; he could get involved with Wrestling, or Sumo wrestling. Basil stopped Andrew with that last part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on! So you have Sumo Wrestling in your world? I have no idea!&quot; He sounded genuine. but unfortunately Andrew had to make it clear that there&#39;s no Sumo Wrestling in this place. But that made him wonder... If there&#39;s similarities between here and the painting, what if it means a reality can shift in a way where there is some sort of Sumo Club in campus.<br />
<br />
As he continued on with examples Writing stories, making art by crafts, drawing, painting... Painting... Andrew needed to ask Basil what his life was like in his world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Basil? Mind telling me what you do in your life?&quot; <br />
<br />
Basil hung his head low, as if he just spilt his favorite drink. He wasn&#39;t ready for that question. &quot;Well... Uh...&quot; he sighs. Andrew took the hint. &quot;You don&#39;t want to talk about it, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no!&quot; Basil tries to reiterate. &quot;I do want to talk about it; But the thing is... It&#39;s hard for me to explain it all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Andrew realizes. &quot;Our memories! It must be hard now we&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basil not wanting to lose the only friend he has. Decides to go with that assumption. &quot;Yeah! That&#39;s it!... Although...&quot; He wasn&#39;t sure if he should bring this up but; It&#39;s better to get it out there. &quot;That elder guy... Mr. K?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean &#39;Professor K&#39;?&quot; Andrew corrected him with a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah him!... He reminds me of one of the elders back home...&quot; Andrew looks at Basil weirdly. &quot;Oh Pan; it is so disturbing. Those two definitely look alike.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew was wondering if the magic could have an effect on this. But he shake that thought in his head away. Thinking like... &#39;Really?... Katsaros? That fat professor, a Satyr? There&#39;s no way! It has to be a coincidences.&#39; Just thinking about it reminds him of that fat satyr called Philoctetes (otherwise known as Phil from [Disney&#39;s] Hercules). It almost made him laugh.<br />
<br />
Anyway; If Basil is not ready to talk about his former life then, he decides to change the topic. Time to move forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, besides wanting to be here; What is it you that wanted to do in life?&quot; Andrew ask him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; Basil is at a lost for words. &quot;No one has asked me that before... I guess... I-... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Andrew cocked his head, that not the response he was expecting. He continues. &quot;I was only trying to find some freedom in traveling, and yet, I didn&#39;t set a goal for myself on where or what I wanted to do... I was hoping to at least find a new home, and maybe make an actual friend.&quot;  <br />
<br />
That made Andrew both sad, and puzzled. &quot;You mean you don&#39;t have anyone from your home that you would miss? What about the Satyrs on the Painting? Do you miss them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Basil shakes his head, and shrugs his shoulders. &quot;I would&#39;ve miss them, if they weren&#39;t so afraid of me, or think I was gonna take their food form them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... I guess even Satyrs can be jerks to each other. I hope you can either find peace in living in this world. Or try to make up to them when you get back to your home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basil just looks at him, wondering if he was joking. Andrew reiterates. &quot;Come on dude! You can&#39;t be that hard on your folks back home. Could you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am not going back! I&#39;m sure they&#39;re not going to miss me.&quot; Basil leans back on his chair. Not wanting to hear anymore of it.<br />
++_______________________________________________++<br />
<br />
<br />
Andrew needed to bring up something on his mind. &quot;So... How do you think this works?... You know the Reality Magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How should I know?&quot; Basil looks at Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the painting, and you were told to never go near it. Were you given a reason for it? Anything at all?&quot; Andrew ask him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah....&quot; Basil drifts off for a bit, trying to think for a moment. &quot;The only thing was, that it was called the &#39;Forbidden Canvas&#39; it was given to us by the Gods, of course they though it was a gift from Pan, but then the satyrs realized. It held evil magic; Spiriting away satyrs only for them to never be seen again, or remembered. At least it was the story I was told, you can take this as you will.&quot; Basil looks away, not even considering if there is any truth to the story.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t believe in that story?&quot;<br />
<br />
Basil looks at him with a smirk. &quot;Well I wouldn’t be here if I still did. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Right... Basil...&quot; Andrew knew what he needed to do, but it will be a hard thing to convince him to join in. &quot;We need to talk to the Professor Katsaros;… You know… Professor K...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on! Andrew; not this again!&quot; Basil sat up at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Basil! You know we need to do this. He may remind you home. But that doesn&#39;t mean you can just say no, whenever you feel like it, I know you my not have good memories of home. But I am not gonna just forget this whole thing and move on. I want to know! Professor K knows more than he&#39;s letting on!&quot; Andrew got up from his chair. &quot;And I know for a fact that you want to know too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basil dropped his indifferent attitude, and took it seriously. &quot;Okay, let say I do want to know. It&#39;s not like Mister K allows anyone to walk in on him.&quot; <br />
<br />
He is right of course, Professor Katsaros may not like any one coming in on him unannounced. Andrew was going to suggest that they make the plan to talk to him tomorrow morning before his class starts, and interrogate him for information.<br />
<br />
And then; it just so happens, Andrew got a text message on his phone, a message from of all people... Professor K. &quot;Well we may have a chance after all.&quot; Andrew grin, until he started reading the message itself. He and Basil are in trouble. &quot;Basil... We need to go. Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew told Basil about the message he got, telling him that Professor Katsaros wants to see him and Basil in his classroom right now. And so they both decide that now is the time to find out, As much as it would&#39;ve been better if it wasn&#39;t like this. But the chance to ask the Professor is now or never, and finding out what is, is better than not knowing.<br />
+++_____________________________________________+++<br />
<br />
<br />
Andrew and Basil made there way to the art class where they&#39;re told where they would meet. There; across from the main desk are two empty chairs facing towards Professor Katsaros&#39; own desk. Professor K. is sitting there at his desk motioning the two of them to sit at their chairs. Professor K&#39;s legs are hidden from view with his desk. The short balding man with a wispy white goatee and a pair of small circular spectacles, and He wears his usual dress clothes, with him being short and wide it could give him a chubby body, though not as fat as Basil let alone big, but one that says &#39;Dad-Bod&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your seats... Andrew... And Basil.&quot; He said it with little to no emotion. Andrew can already guess that Professor K is not happy; he may not be happy but, he didn&#39;t have to make it feel like an execution. Granted. Andrew wanted to talk to him, but not like this!<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to first of all say that my name is &#39;Professor Niko Katsaros&#39;, and I am not pleased with this situation, you both got some explaining to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Professor face Andrew and starts. &quot;Andrew... what were you doing last night?&quot; He sounded calm, but make no mistake that he took offense to Andrew&#39;s recent actions.<br />
<br />
Andrew scratch the back of his head. &quot;Well Professor K uh... you see... I forgot my case for my glasses so I went back here to get-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t lie!&quot; The Professor snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Baah!...&quot; Which made Andrew give an involuntary bleat. He hoped that he didn&#39;t notice that.<br />
<br />
K clears his throat and reiterates quietly this time. &quot;Don&#39;t play dumb with me... I know you were looking at the painting... weren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew nods his head defeated. To which Basil who sit at his right, feels bad for him, even he can&#39;t blame his friend for being curious about the painting.<br />
<br />
K is not done. &quot;You should have known better than to snoop around to other peoples things, so as punishment; you are going to do work for me. Understand?&quot; Andrew nodded again. &quot;You will work until you learn your lesson. To make up for your breaking and entering.&quot; And now it&#39;s Basil&#39;s turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you...&quot; Basil sits up and looks at Professor K nervous about what he wants to ask. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Uh...&quot; Basil tries to use his new memories to make a story. &quot;I came here abroad to learn-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... no...&quot; Professor K raise his head to stop him. &quot;You don&#39;t belong here, and I mean you don&#39;t belong in *OUR* world!&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew is shock by this. Does he really know?! But Basil isn&#39;t going down without even trying. &quot;I&#39;m sorry sir if my mannerisms is not appropriate here. I&#39;ll try to be better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually Basil... Let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s really inappropriate...&quot; Then he leans in and says this. &quot;Why is a prince doing in a place like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
There... He got Basil to drop the act, he&#39;s not fooling him anymore. &quot;You... you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is actually news to Andrew, he is as surprise as Basil is right now. &quot;W-wait a minute! W-why didn&#39;t you tell me you&#39;re a prince?&quot; Basil turns to look at Andrew with shame &quot;Because I-... I wanted to make a real friend, one that sees me as me and not as a prince.&quot;<br />
<br />
In Andrew&#39;s defense he never thought that he would look the type to remotely be royalty. Although who knows... maybe the king, or chieftain is (just as fat if not) more fatter than his son. And he wanted his son to follow his example. That&#39;s not to say that Basil hated being fat, maybe he ran away because he wanted to escape from whatever responsibility he had to do. And Andrew indirectly helped him escape.<br />
He brought a prince to his classroom... Imagine that!<br />
<br />
And then Professor K decides to make the choice to pour salt in the wound. &quot;You are lying, just like what Andrew been doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; They both say in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t say you were a prince because you wanted to make friends, you didn&#39;t say because you wanted to run away from your duties! Not to mention you&#39;ve dreamt of being a human, and when there&#39;s a chance to make an escape; you took it! Imagine how your father must feel... He&#39;s either sad or angry that you&#39;re gone! And think about it! The reality magic hardly affects the people who live inside that Greek painting. It&#39;s only a matter of time before they figure out that you&#39;re in their sacred painting now! They&#39;ll either try to destroy it, or find a way to get into our world! The great God Pan would be disappointed in you.&quot; And after that rant he concludes it with a question. &quot;Let me ask you this instead... How do you like being a human now? Prince?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;baah...&quot; Basil gave dejected bleat. All that happiness he just had, instantly turned to shame. He really did make a mistake, But he did want to make a real friend who sees him as a person, and not just because he wanted to be a human. In fact he had made a friend; with Andrew. But does he still see him as a friend though?<br />
<br />
The Professor continues. &quot;I didn&#39;t think so... We are going to find a way to bring you back to your world. And hopefully you won&#39;t come back here ever again. And Andrew...&quot; He looks at Andrew. &quot;I want you to help me. since you have become a Satyr I want you to investigate inside that painting for me. I only have one life. one perspective. Since you carelessly went in, you&#39;ll have to be the one to help. I am inviting you both to come back here in this classroom, tonight. So we&#39;ll discuss this further. In the meantime-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP!&quot; Andrew have had it with K&#39;s vague knowledge, and he can&#39;t take much more of this! He needed to know why! And how does he even know all of this!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me... Why?! Why should I even be your errand boy?&quot; Andrew demanded as he got up and puts his hands on K&#39;s desk. The Professor is glaring up at him. Not happy with that response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now why should I tell you?&quot; He&#39;s still sitting at his desk. It&#39;s amazing that he never got up out of his desk at that point. &quot;You&#39;re the one who got in here that night, and brought him!&quot; He motions towards Basil. &quot;...away from his home! And you expect me to... what?... open up to you?&quot;<br />

Andrew is not gonna lie; He does have a point. But he can&#39;t just let him win this one. &quot;And you expect ME to listen to you? Why should I trust you? I mean... You make such a big deal about it! The fact that you know so much about this whole dam painting?!&quot; Andrew pointed at both the painting and the Professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Andrew...&quot; Basil tried to stop him from talking but Andrew kept going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me one good reason why I should help you, and take you seriously? I&#39;m starting to believe that you could be the reason for all of this! The one responsible for all of the missing people!&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems that Andrew won&#39;t stand down until he&#39;s convinced. &#39;Looks like I don&#39;t have much of a choice.&#39; Professor Katsaros thinks to himself. And he starts laughing, That made Basil worry, and made Andrew freaked out. Has he gone crazy? Then Professor K starts talking to Basil with a lighter tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t stay mad at you can I?... But seriously, Basil, you can&#39;t stay here! You need to see your father so that way no one will be hurt, and just think... If you’re lucky you can stay with Andrew for a while!&quot; K is being positive with such happiness its scaring Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Andrew, I see you won&#39;t cooperate unless I tell you my role here.&quot; He&#39;ll either have to tell them, or show them. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll tell you.&quot; And so he got up and backed away from his desk standing up to face them directly.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when Andrew realizes that...</p>
<hr/><h3>
Why does Professor Katsaros know so much about this?</h3>
