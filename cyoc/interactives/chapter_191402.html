<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon you noticed movement from Samantha, although based on her suddenly moving away from you and some general zig zagging, she didn&#39;t handle &quot;waking up&quot; so well. You tried waving, which she showed a brief pause to but kept moving this way and that. This wasn&#39;t getting any better when you remembered the telepathy.<br />
<br />
The Marshals said the best way to get use to using was just pretend you were &quot;concentrating&quot; and point it towards who you wanted to like imaging a psychic line. They said it that telepathy more complex than that, but just to get use to doing it that way. So you did, even raising one of your front legs above your head like you were doing some cheesy, psychic attack.<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure if you were making any actual connection towards Samantha, although she took notice of what you were doing and settled into a corner. You took this opportunity to just &quot;talk&quot; to see if something would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha. Do not worry. I am Jacob.&quot; Trying to detect the body language of ANOTHER fly was another alien lesson to learn, but you were imagining Samantha was less worried now and looking to listen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Concentrate. Talk. Be &quot;psychic.&quot;&quot; You realized your telepathic speech was kind of stilted, kind of like a Dog Trainer giving simple commands, but the Marshals said better use of it would come with time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Samantha. You are Jacob?&quot; you heard Samantha&#39;s voice in your head, somehow sensing it coming from the direction of the other fly. You went so smile and give a thumbs-up for conversation, but this just resulted in a slight proboscis jiggle and a raised front-leg. You tried to make a headshake of frustration out of this, but that too didn&#39;t turn out too well. This was going to take a bit.<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure of how much time was passing at this point, but you predicted Samantha and yourself passed a few hours getting use to your bodies together, especially with one another to help give guidance and suggestions. You both got better at communicating via telepathy while doing this, but the concentration aspect made it hard to rely on for constant communication. Communicating through body language came easier than expected. You had a feeling it might not ever reach something as thorough as sign language, but being able to communicate &quot;Yes/no&quot; and pointing at things was already helping by leaps and bounds. All in all, you both use telepathy to confirm this was pretty fun, especially seeing two House Flies doing funny things in the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sex? Attempt?&quot; suddenly came from Samantha. &quot;Yes.&quot; you responded.<br />
<br />
Before changing you both learned about about the basic mating behavior of House Flies. You didn&#39;t care much for going through all of that, being a human mind in a female House Fly&#39;s body, so you immediately turned your back towards Samantha, made a &quot;bracing&quot; motion, and hope she got the idea. She did. <br />
<br />
Being a male House fly, she was slightly smaller than you but flew a bit straight on to your back (you also noticed her weight didn&#39;t affect you much) then moved into position like she was hugging you. Beginner&#39;s adjustment or not, you felt like she was trying to figure out how to best get into the &quot;Mating&quot; position you both learned about, but seemed like she just held on the best she could while avoiding your wings, than did some motioning with her abdomen. Remembering that Flies didn&#39;t have Vaginas and Penis in the typical sense, you felt like you had a little abdomen control and tried your best to maneuver your ovipositor into whatever opening Samantha had in her abdomen. Like your previous masturbation, this was getting you riled up until felt like your ovipositor was in a hole. Based on Samantha&#39;s movements, and a sudden motion with one of her limbs, you took this as a signal that you were both ready to go.<br />
<br />
It was weird and extremely satisfying at the same time. You and Samantha were actually having sex as house flies, and you took a short pause to exchanged a telepathic message to make sure if Samantha was feeling good as well, and she said yes. Other than some limb motions from Samantha to adjust her hold on you, it looked like very little was going on in the mirror for both of you, and whatever was going on with your anatomies would just be between the both of you, literally. What you really cared about is whatever equivalent of your buggy vagina was on pleasure overdrive. Alien movements but pleasure is pleasure. You felt like you had an orgasm again, and wondering if Samantha noticed.<br />
<br />
There was a sudden movement from Samantha from her side of genitals, then felt something sticky and liquid inside yourself. You were still getting use to your new senses, but you were confident Samantha just had her first orgasm. It didn&#39;t stop though, and with some maneuvering you turned to from a blindspot to see that there was trail of buggy juice falling from you despite Samantha still connected to you on your back. The pleasure didn&#39;t stop for yourself either, and soon found yourself in the 2nd orgasm of your Fly sex session. You were very glad that you tweaked the sexual settings for all this to happen. <br />
<br />
With a quick message of &quot;End.&quot;, Samantha suddenly flew off of you to land and stand still. You imagined there was alot going on in her mind, as there was alot going in yours, but you were again reminded of your fly body and its lack of expression. You didn&#39;t even need to point your heads towards the mirror for most of your interactions as both of you were already getting use to your new field of vision. Just to change things up and add some novelty, you skittered in front of Samantha, pushed out your proboscis and maneuvered it the best your could to &quot;kiss&quot; her face. Now there was a motion from Samantha for that. To finish it off, you moved even closer and did your best to hug her body with your front limbs, knocking your face and huge bulging eyes into her own. This did little discomfort to your eyes other than vision being effected a little, but then Samantha seem to get the idea tried her best to &quot;hug&quot; you as well.<br />
<br />
You looked forward to the rest of your time as House Flies.</p>
