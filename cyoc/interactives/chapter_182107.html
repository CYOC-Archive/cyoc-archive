<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mason was stunned as the movie ended and the Mons and kids around her started to shuffle out. She’d transformed into a woman, looking like Janette was probably supposed to in ten years. She had that mom body with a nice figure marred by childbirth and doughier breasts than normal. She looked exhausted and could feel it too, and the answer to why was easy to find. Janette was bouncing in her chair right next to her and she wouldn’t stop talking.<br />
<br />
“And the horseback riding scene and the song about birds and the big poofy dresses! Mommy can I have a horse, I promise to feed it!” Janette rambled but she didn’t wait to an answer, she just slipped from her chair and grabbed Mason’s hand following the new mom out of the theatre and then outside to the parking lot. She stood there stunned, uncertain of what to do. She couldn’t go back to the school, she couldn’t go back home to her parents, she was just lost.<br />
<br />
“Who am I now?” She asked in a hushed whisper. She didn’t know what to do for some time, staring aimlessly at nothing until she noticed that she’d instinctively grabbed a purse. She dug around in it for a while before her hands found a pair of car keys and she let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
She then felt her way around the parking lot searching for the vehicle the keys were connected to, and she found it.<br />
<br />
Mason had always dreamed of nice cars, wanting an expensive one when she grew up, but right before her was a minivan, the classic soccer mom type with doors that slid backwards, garbage, stray fries, and the smell of puke wafting from the interior, and rust spots that told her the vehicle was second hand.<br />
<br />
“Great,” she growled through grit teeth, feeling incredibly annoyed at her new reality.<br />
<br />
There was a GPS inside with a destination labeled as home so she input that destination and started the long journey home, and it wasn’t long because of distance, no, it was long because of Janette.<br />
<br />
“Are we there yet?” She ask.<br />
<br />
“Can we get burgers?” She’d demand.<br />
<br />
“I’m bored! Can we go see another movie?!” She’s whine while Mason felt agitation swell in her body. She said no over and over like her own parents had done to her when she’d been six.<br />
<br />
Eventually they pulled into the driveway of a suburban house with toys all over the front lawn. Mason stumbled to the door and unlocked it while Janette burst inside and began running about with glee. She was so loud and Mason had such a bad headache that she couldn’t take it anymore. She turns on the TV and some inane cartoon began to play. Then, for the first time since she’d become six, Janette shut up and plopped herself down in front of the TV. Mason meanwhile just lay down on the couch and her body was so tired she fell asleep there, drifting into a light snore and being consumed by rest.<br />
<br />
The TV kept going as she slept and soon five o clock passed and a vehicle pulled into the driveway. Loud steps filled the air as a figure emerged at the door seconds before it swung open a d a man loomed in the doorway.<br />
<br />
“Daddy!” Janette shouted while bouncing to her feet and scrambling towards the woman.<br />
<br />
“Hey there kiddo, how was your movie?” He asked while Janette started to ramble about her film. He paused in his walking before Mason and bent down, gently moving some hair out of her face and planting a soft kiss on her cheek before continuing. He left Mason snoozing on the couch in silence, her nap filling the void of exhaustion Janette had left her with, and she didn’t emerge from it until the evening had hit.<br />
<br />
She stirred strangely, have a stretch and blinked awake, being reminded that she was in a woman’s body again and sighing.<br />
<br />
“Long day,” a man’s voice commented and she whirled around to see a guy sitting not too far away with any features of Janette’s absent from her own body in his DNA. He had a ring on his finger that matched hers and it dawned on her that this must be her husband.<br />
<br />
“Um... theatre full of screaming kids,” she admitted nervously.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I fed Janette,” her husband explained with a smile filled with an uncomfortable amount of love, as if Mason and her flabby post childbirth body was the most beautiful creature in the world.<br />
<br />
“Do... do you want me to feed you?” Mason asked, unsure if she was a housewife or a working mom or a university student still.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, someone’s frisky,” he grinned, completely misinterpreting the question. He put his book aside and approached her with a horny look in his eyes that she wanted to escape from, she stood up, it was too late because he was upon her, and he pressed his lips against hers. Mason wasn’t sure what to expect but it definitely hadn’t been kissing him back and feeling a craving surge through her loins. Her husband kissed her hard and began to guide her down the hallway, his hands feeling her body up and making her return the favour. They only paused outside the room that must have been Janette’s listening to her watching a movie in there.<br />
<br />
Then he kissed her neck and she had to stifle a girlish giggle before they entered the room that must have been theirs and her clothes left her body. The stretch marks and sagging breasts didn’t deter this man, instead he doubled down on her, pressing her down on the bed and kissing her feverishly. She gasped in pleasure before kissing back, loving the feeling for some reason and enjoying the idea of what was to come.<br />
<br />
He exposed his dick and Mason smiled at it, unable to take her eyes from it. She wanted to touch it but her husband was busy putting a condom on and pulling out a bottle of lube. She snatched it from his hands, unable to wait any more and squirted some on her fingers before beginning to lather the condom up with it, fingers tracing his dick as she went.<br />
<br />
“Madison baby, you haven’t done a handjob I. Years,” he grinned and she felt herself get wet at her new name. She was Madison and this man and his beautiful cock were all hers. She was weirdly okay with that. Being a woman didn’t seem so horrible anymore. In fact she was kind of looking forward to that cock penetrating her. Earlier that day she’d been hoping to spike Janette with her own cock but this was even more exciting.<br />
<br />
“Hi, I’m Madison,” she greeted in a playful tone as she finished lubing her husband up. She lay back and her finger spread her vagina a little, inviting the man in.<br />
<br />
“I’m Tyler,” he replied with a cheesy grin and suddenly Madison remembered how they’d first met. She’d been after some cock in university and just grabbed a random guy a year ahead of her and given him a handjob. It was only after he’d spilled his swimmers on her face that they’d been properly introduced.<br />
<br />
Tyler then moved in closer and with a slick movement his cock entered her vagina and a wave of pleasure rocked Madison’s body. She moaned loudly and had to cover her mouth to prevent their daughter from hearing. She interrupted them so much, chances were that this moment would be ruined by their joint creation too.<br />
<br />
They made out while they mated, lips sucking at one another and hot breaths escaping their lips as the fucking got more and more intense. His cock slid in and out of her body, back and forth in a numbing rhythm that made her entire body shake and an orgasm release with a moan. She was lubed even further then and her husband could go even faster. She wrapped her legs around him, ground her hips against his, and kneaded her soft breasts between her fingers. Her husband rocked her with pure bliss and their entire bed frame squeaked and groaned from the intensity. Their daughter interrupted so much and yet this time it wasn’t happening, this time they were actually going to make it.<br />
<br />
Their kissing got more intense, her vagina was absolutely numb from all the rubbing, and she didn’t ever want it to stop. She liked this, no she loved this. All the horror from the movie theatre was gone, this was what she wanted now. She wanted to be a loving wife raising a child with this man. She wanted more, she wanted to experience a pregnancy herself, she wanted another screaming infant she needed to breastfeed and change. Her dreams and desires had changed. She wanted to make a family with this man more than anything and when his body gave a lurch and he filled that condom with his seed she knew that the next time they did it she’d ask him to leave it off. She wanted to be stuffed with a baby, or another baby. She had vague memories of giving birth to Janette.<br />
<br />
She kissed her husband some more as that horny feeling faded and when he pulled out she fluttered her eyelashes at him cutely and writhed on the bedsheets, still feeling all that pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Janette didn’t interrupt us,” she cooed.<br />
<br />
“Nope, I think we might be able to resume our schedule,” he grinned and she blushed hard at that statement, excitement boiling beneath her skin. She wanted him in her so bad, to have his dick in one of her holes three or four times a week without a baby cry or call from their daughter filling the air. It had been six years since they’d last had a regular sex schedule and Madison wasn’t about to pass that up. Having another baby could wait, she wanted her husbands duck in her on the regular again. Maybe a year or two of that before she suggested another child. Janette would be off at school soon so they’d have plenty of time during lunch break to get a little quickie in.</p>
