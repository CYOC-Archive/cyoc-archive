<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You never saw Daniel&#39;s parents again. Mrs and Mr Griffiths took you in, becoming your parents though workings they did through their Law Firm, making you, legally, Kasidy Wright, the daughter of Mrs Griffiths deceased sister. Upon hearing this, you expressed your concerns this wouldn&#39;t work, someone would find out the truth, and you&#39;d be made to go live with Daniel&#39;s mom and dad. To ease your fears, Mrs Griffiths sat you down to talk with you, telling you much, including how she did have a sister who&#39;d recently died, and who could have had a daughter, as she lived off the grid and little to no contact with society.<br />
<br />
Fears put to rest after some time, the next thing you found yourself having to deal with was how you now had to live with the consequences of your wish. As Mrs Griffiths had said, if she and Mr Griffiths took you, becoming your mommy and daddy, you&#39;d have to remain a girl and stop looking for the well. At first, you didn&#39;t want to, and would often sneak out whenever you got the chance, with the result the always same thing - you coming home, tired, your new parents and sister worried out of the mind for your safety, followed by some punishment. How long you continued on like this, you couldn&#39;t say. But, as months slipped by, and you overheard Mr Griffith talking about how Daniel was reported as a runaway, then listed as dead, the guest room ceased to be that and became your bedroom, which you had to share with Lynn and Jessica, Mr Griffiths nieces, Mrs Griffiths nieces-in-law, when they came to visit, and you grew accustomed to and learned to be a girl, the times you went in search of the well fell off until you stopped looking altogether. Something made all the easier when it was announced your new family was moving a town in Michigan.<br />
<br />
New house, new town, you started the fourth grade as a girl. And though you missed your friends, you made new ones, first in one of your ballet recitals, then in another in your gymnastic classes. In addition, you also had Julie as a big sister. And whilst it was not how you&#39;d dreamed of being with her, you couldn&#39;t argue with how things turned out, as she was there to help you when you struggled, until, at the age of twenty, she announced she was going off to University, and wouldn&#39;t be home until the winter break. Taking in everything, all the changes, the up and downs, you came to believe you had adjusted to life as a girl, and had a good handle on things, but had this thrown out the window when, at the age of thirteen, one cold day in February your body decided it wanted to change things, and you came to understand better what Mrs Griffith had sat you down and talked about two year prior, as well as the stuff covered in health class as you started to develop breasts.<br />
<br />
Sore, sensitive, unpleasant, you soon came to conclusion you didn&#39;t like what was happening. Having to learn what it meant when a girl went through puberty, you found yourself thrust back six years ago when you made your wish and you were forced into being something you knew nothing about. Mrs Griffiths assuring, &quot;This is a time of transition for girls and, in one way or another, they all feel as you do,&quot; you didn&#39;t find it comforting, especially when you realised in another year or so, you could look forward to starting to bleed from between your legs. Thinking about this, you started to withdraw from everything around you, finding the only thing which eased the issues you were facing was your ballet and gymnastic classes.<br />
<br />
Again, Mrs Griffiths assured you, &quot;This is normal,&quot; and tried to encourage you not to withdraw so much, and promised in a month Julie would be home and she could also help you.<br />
<br />
Unsure how she could, as she was nine years older than you, you struggled on. Worrying about your body, and what it was doing, concerned more than ever about your appearance and your clothes, it came as a shock when, as the school year ended, you discovered there was a cute, shy boy in a couple of your classes you wished would talk to you, ask you out. Talking to Mrs Griffiths about this, she again said, &quot;This is normal,” then explained, “A girl at your age often comes to start taking new interests in specific people around her. It could be boys, like you&#39;ve expressed, girls, like in the way Julie expressed, or neither. And it could be the age you’re at, thirteen, younger, like my sister, or older, like Julie and a couple of your father&#39;s sisters. This is something every girl experiences. And yes, it can be confusing, trust me when I say it&#39;ll work out. Though, I strongly urge you caution,&quot; and when you asked why, she further explained things your health class had only begun to tackle, and had promised further information of sex education when you were in a higher grade.<br />
<br />
Conflicted as to how it felt to learn you were becoming sexually active, &quot;Or maybe I already am, and just becoming aware of it,&quot; you speculated, as well as the high chance you&#39;d be attracted to boys, you were thrust even further back mentally as you remember how, at one time you had been a boy. Finding it confusing, you were relieved when the school year ended and around the first day of summer, Julie came home with her fiancé, a student in her classes name Vicky.<br />
<br />
At first, it was hard to get Julie alone, and you got the impression Vicky for some reason didn&#39;t care for you. But when you at last did get her alone, the two of spent time catching up, she reassured you Vicky didn&#39;t hate you, and she helped in whatever way she could to reassure you on what you were feeling and give you fresh insight in the problems you were facing, among other things. Taking to once again going on bike rides with her, you didn&#39;t want Vicky with at first, but by mid-July, you relaxed around her, and discovered she was cool to be around, and would often treat you as a favourite younger sister, much in the same way Julie did.<br />
<br />
If she knew anything of your past, she didn&#39;t say. And when you asked Julie about it, your sister merely shrugged and said, &quot;It&#39;s for you to tell, not me.&quot; and relieved by this, you decided to keep this part of your history to yourself.<br />
<br />
July slipped into August, and you continued to learn and try new things. At the encouragement of Julie and Vicky, who said, &quot;With your small frame, your height of four foot six, and your complexion, you&#39;d look great in one,&quot; among other reassuring things, you were soon convinced to try wearing a bikini. And choosing a style called bandeau, though you were unsure about the bottom piece, which sat low in front, you soon found yourself loving the swim wear, and bought a number of other pairs, some with shoulder straps, but most without.<br />
<br />
Confident in your choices, finding wearing such a garment was liberating, you took to something wearing just the top piece with a pair of shorts, but no shirt. Your mother didn’t approve, but Vicky and Julie did, and sometimes did the same, so you felt it was okay. <br />
<br />
Your time with the two growing shorter as mid-august drew near, and your sister and her fiancé talked about the classes they’d be taking in the fall, and you started to get ready for ninth grade, you found yourself starting to withdraw again. Getting up early one August morning, you decided you wanted to have a bike ride, and a bikini top and cotton spandex biking shorts would be comfortable to ride in. Getting dressed, you slipped through the house as quiet as possible, wanting some time by yourself. Collecting your bike helmet and bicycle, you thought back to all the times you&#39;d spent searching for the well, riding with Julie, as you pedalled out of the garage and down the street.<br />
<br />
On the next block, you give yourself over to pumping the pedals and enjoying the cool, morning breeze. Letting your thoughts wander, you didn&#39;t notice at first when two others joined you. Stopping after a couple blocks to take a breather, it was then you notice the two others with you was Vicky and Julie. Smiling, you asked, &quot;How long have you been there,&quot; to which Julie commented, &quot;A couple blocks now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of you smiling at each other, you began to talk about random things, some so intimate, you&#39;d blush and excuse yourself if you&#39;d still been a boy. After a bit, the three of you each mount your bikes and set out. The blocks passing by, it came as a surprise when the three of you soon found yourself in a part of town you didn&#39;t recognise. Slowing as the three of you approached a park, you talked amongst yourselves, and after a bit of discussion, you all decided to turn around. Approaching a small wooded area, you called out, &quot;Turning around here,&quot; and applying the brakes, you start to do so, but instead come to a complete stop.<br />
<br />
Long buried and almost forgotten, a memory threatened to resurface. Looking about, feeling as if you were looking at something familiar, you dismounted, and started to walk. Passing trees which now looked older, you soon find yourself at a set of stone steps. Following them up, you stop when you find yourself looking at the well. Thrust back to the day six years ago when you made your wish to better understand girls, and ending up becoming one, you were jarred out of your thoughts when from behind you, Vicky exclaimed, &quot;Oh, wow. Is that one of those supposed wishing wells?&quot; and turning, you watch as the other two walked up the steps, Julie stopped next to you, and Vicky stepped closer to the well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it the well you were talking about,&quot; Julie asked and you nodded.<br />
<br />
Vicky, after she&#39;d given the two of you a searching look, turned back to the well. As she did this, Julie whispered, &quot;You could make a wish. Maybe undo your first one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought had crossed your mind the moment you saw the well. And as if to encourage it, you saw in the grass a coin. Thinking about it, you moved closer to brush off the signs, revealing what they said. Turning to your sister, you take a deep breath and said, &quot;For some time, it&#39;s all I wanted. But now,&quot; and with a shrug, you glanced at the well as Vicky gave you a curious look.<br />
<br />
Julie, as if to answer her, shook her head and explained, &quot;It&#39;s for Kasidy to tell, if she wants to.&quot;<br />
<br />
For reasons you couldn&#39;t explain, you didn&#39;t want to tell Vicky. It wasn&#39;t you were ashamed to admit you had once been a guy, or were scared she&#39;d reject you, &quot;Maybe as badly as Daniel&#39;s parents had,&quot; you remind yourself. Looking at the well, taking another deep breath, you shake your head and tell Julie, &quot;No,&quot; and when she gives you a questioning look, you state, &quot;I thought about it. And, yeah, for some time, it was all I wanted. But, now? This is who I am. I&#39;m not going to use magick to help me. Especially if it requires one to be so specific, it&#39;s not funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your sister nodded at this and drawing you into a hug, she whispered, &quot;I&#39;m glad you made the choice you did,&quot; before releasing you.<br />
<br />
With the satisfaction you&#39;d made the right decision, even if it meant you for sure had left your old self behind, would never be a boy again, you felt relieved. About to head back to the bikes, you stopped when Vicky announced, &quot;Listen, I don&#39;t know what you two are talking about, but I am going to make a wish. Even if it&#39;s for fun and nothing comes of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t,&quot; Julie and you yelped at the same time, and as Vicky got a hurt look on her face, Julie stepped closer to take Vicky’s hand and draw her away, as you said, &quot;Trust me. Making a wish from this well might seem fun, that nothing will come of it, but isn&#39;t that simple,&quot; and as Julie led Vicky away from the well, you heaved a sigh and said, &quot;What if I told you a story? A story about a boy named Daniel who, after a mistake he made one day, he made a wish on this very same well,&quot; and the three of you heading back to where you&#39;d left the bicycles, and then home, you told Vicky of the wish to understand girls and what came of it.</p>
