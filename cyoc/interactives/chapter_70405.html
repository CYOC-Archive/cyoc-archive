<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In had been partially his idea and partially his girlfriend's idea for them to not only try a bit of role-reversal in their love making but also to go a whole day dressed as the opposite sex. Talbot, when he proposed the idea of role-reversal in their love making hadn't thought Echo would go for it and was taken by surprise when she not only agreed, but had also suggested that each spend the day as the opposite sex before they tried the new form of making out. Unsure, Talbot had almost ducked out but when Echo had made some off-hand comments, he quickly agreed.<br />
<br />
Now, going through the lost and found at the school he and Echo had just started at, Talbot wondered why he had so readily agreed. He knew that it wasn't because he was insecure in his manhood. Or that he had a secret wish to be a girl. Stopping as he pulled a pair of a pair of woman's shoes, he thought for a moment why he might have struck such a bargain.<br />
<br />
Unable to think of any reason, he gazed up and down the hall. Seeing nobody, he slipped one of his feet out of his shoe and placed up against the one of the bottom of one of the shoes he just taken from the lost and found box. Noting that it was at least a size bigger, he decided that it would do and stuffing them into his book-bag, he headed home, glad that it was the end of the school day and that this deal he'd made was for only one day and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Catching the bus home, he greeted his dad, who was watching something, and headed toward his room. Inside, he latched the door and tossed his book-bag onto his bed. Heading for the closet, he took out the other things he taken from the lost and found since he had made the agreement. Unfolding the shirt first, he noted that it was a purple tank top with a fishnet top over it and thought it was something a Goth would wear.<br />
<br />
As he tossed this on the bed next to his pack, Talbot unfolded the pants, noting there size and that they looked exactly like a pair of Grey Torque Pants he'd seen at the local Hot Topic in the section selling girl's clothing. Tossing them onto the shirt, he unrolled the fishnet stockings and took out the tiny, bright blue underwear and bra he had stored with the stockings. Wishing he could have found a dress instead, he set undergarments on the bed. Sitting down next to them, he thought about the time it had taken him to collect the items and reaching for his book bag, he took a mobile out of one of the front pockets and began to dial.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Sitting in her room, wondering what Talbot was doing and thinking of going over to his place, Echo thought about the clothes she'd taken from the lost and found over the past couple months, sure that nobody was going to miss them, as she was sure they had been in there for some time.<br />
<br />
A ringing noise distracted her thoughts and glancing in the direction of the hallway, Echo found she didn't have to wait long before her mother called up, saying that Talbot was on the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be right there,&quot; Echo answered and heading downstairs, he took the phone at the foot of the stairs.<br />
<br />
The moment she said, &quot;Hello,&quot; she heard Talbot saying that he had everything and than ask if she still wanted to go through with their deal.<br />
<br />
Nodding, Echo immediately replied, &quot;Only if you still do,&quot; which Talbot said he did. And from there conversation drifted, but eventually ended with them agreeing to meet over at Echo's house sometime early in the morning the next day.<br />
<br />
As she hung up, glad that it was Friday, Echo began to hum absently to herself as she headed back upstairs to her room. There, she took out from under her bed a box of things she had taken from the school lost and found. Opening the box, she glanced at the pair of boxers, shoes and socks, the blue jeans, long-sleeved shirt and skater-beanie. Picking each up, she smelled each garment, making sure that each item still smelled fresh, she washed the garments several times since acquiring them, and satisfied, she placed them back into the box.<br />
<br />
Putting the lid back on the box, Echo sat for a moment and wondered if she could actually pull off being a dude for one day. Smiling and suddenly thinking of Talbot, she asked herself whether he boyfriend could pull off being a girl and deciding she would just have to wait, she stood and figured she would see what mother had planned for dinner.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Talbot groaned as his alarm clock went off and he realised that it was Saturday. Sliding out of bed, noting the time was nearly seven and he had two hours before he met Echo, Talbot yawned and trudged towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, he passed his father, who commented, &quot;You're up early for a Saturday,&quot; and walking into the bathroom, Talbot told him, &quot;Yeah. I have to go meet Echo. We're supposed to do a science project together,&quot; and closing the door, he pushed down on his boxers and stood before the toilet.<br />
<br />
As he stood there, wishing his bladder would hurry up, Talbot thought about his book bag, already packed with the garments he'd taken from the lost and found. Silently glad that he'd washed them several times, he thought about the hair ribbon he'd found in the pocket. Figuring he wouldn't need it because his hair was to short, Talbot finished up in the bathroom and headed back to his room to change.<br />
<br />
When he finally left to go to Echo's, Talbot thought about swinging by the school and seeing if he could find anything else in the lost and found. As he walked down the sidewalk, his bag slung over one shoulder, he let his mind drift and after a moment, still thinking about stopping by the school, he found himself wondering why it was that he'd agreed. Walking to his girlfriend's place, the only logical reasoning he could come to was that he'd allowed himself to be bullied into it.<br />
<br />
Nodding, figuring that this made sense, he asked himself, &quot;So are you going to back out or go through with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he decided that he might as well go through with it, since he already had the clothes, Talbot realised that his slow meandering had taken him to the school. Stopping, he listened and noting that there sounded like there were people out on the field, he tried the front doors.<br />
<br />
Surprised to find them open, Talbot adjusted his bag, took a deep breath and slipped in. Creeping down the hallway, meeting no one as he did so, Talbot was silently glad for it as he cast a furtive glance up and down the hallway as he moved through the school. When he reached the lost and found, he paused for a moment before beginning to once again paw through the lost and found. Sure that he wasn't going to find anything, he stopped when he found what looked like a girl's pencil case.<br />
<br />
Taking in the pink colour and the bright, shooting stars, Talbot almost tossed it back, but instead unzipped it. Inside he found not pencils but make-up, highlights and hair colouring, brushes, a couple other items and several things that took him a moment before he realised that they were tampons.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will do,&quot; he thought and dropping it into his book-bag, Talbot took one final look up and down the hallway before hastily leaving the school.<br />
***<br />
<br />
When he finally arrived at Echo's place, the girl greeted him by saying, &quot;I thought you were going to back out,&quot; to which Talbot merely shook his head and explained, &quot;Had to make sure everything was in order.&quot; as he slipped his bag off his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Smiling at this, Echo nodded and waving for him to follow, she started up to her room, telling him, &quot;My moms out of town for the weekend. So we don't have to worry about being discovered. I thought we would start with you, since you are going to be a girl for a whole day and girls generally take longer to get ready than boys do,&quot; as followed him upstairs and into her room.<br />
<br />
As Talbot nodded, he handed her his book-bag and asked, &quot;Does this stuff go together?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking out the shoes first, Echo squealed, &quot;Black Cross Lace shoes. These are the best shoes out there and they go with almost everything,&quot; and taking out the pants next, she nodded in approval before taking out the shirt, underwear, bra and shirt.<br />
<br />
As she examined the make-up kit, Echo asked, &quot;How much body hair do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Embarrassed suddenly, Talbot shifted about before finally answering her question. Going to her dresser, Echo said, &quot;You are going to need to shave. Fortunately, I have something my great-aunt makes that doesn't sting or burn, can be used on sensitive areas and makes the skin feel soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a canister of something, Echo tossed it to Talbot and said, &quot;I want you to rub that over your face, torso, arms, armpits, groin and legs. Leave it on for about five minutes and than wash it off,&quot; and pointing to something out her room, she explained, &quot;After you've washed it off, I want you to shower using the hygiene stuff I laid out for you in the bathroom. There is also a kitchen timer for you to use.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he caught it and examined it, Talbot asked, &quot;Is this really necessary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to look like a girl for a whole day, and I am to look like a boy for a day, than yes,&quot; Echo answered as she began examining the make-up Talbot had taken from the lost and found.<br />
***<br />
<br />
It took him nearly an hour to shower, mostly because there was a lot more items to use and that he at first was unsure about them, including the idea of using a loofah sponge and washing himself with a body wash that smelled strongly of berries. But when he was finally finished, Talbot wrapped a towel around his waist and headed back to Echo's room.<br />
<br />
There, Echo greeted him by telling him, &quot;We're going to first do your hair,&quot; and ordering him back to the bathroom, she had him sit down with his back to the sink, where she began to first run a brush through it and than apply a couple colours to both his hair and his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
Afterward, his hair wrapped up in a towel, Echo led him back to her bedroom, where she had him dress in the clothes he'd brought. When he'd done that, only struggling with the bra and fishnet stockings, she had him sit down before her mirror and working with the rest of the items in the case, she applied a bit of lipstick to Talbot's lips and than ran a brush over the skin on his face and arms.<br />
<br />
When she'd finished with that, Echo took away the towel and started working his hair. Sitting at her vanity, Talbot watched as she ran a brush through his hair, teased it one way and than another and finally left a bit of his bangs hanging down over his left side and tide the rest back with the hair ribbon just at the nape of his neck. When she finished, Talbot noted that she coloured his hair black on the very top, but had shaded the part that was hanging down over his face and everything going round his head a light shade of blue.<br />
<br />
Asking, &quot;Why'd you colour my hair black on top, but shade it blue on everything from just about even with the ears and down,&quot; Talbot thought that not only was he looking at a very pretty girl of about fourteen, fifteen years old, but that way he talked for some reason also sounded like a girl's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it goes with your clothes,&quot; Echo replied and picking up what she'd taken, she said, &quot;I'm going to go change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling that was reasonable explanation, Talbot nodded as he shifted about, staring at his reflection from various angles, thinking that Echo had done a great job and that he really did look like a fourteen or fifteen year old girl. &quot;Now,&quot; he thought as he stood. &quot;Can I pass for one.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a moment, Echo was back, dressed in the clothes she'd taken and looking more like fifteen-year-old guy. Dropping her pyjamas on the bed, she grinned and commented, &quot;You totally make a cute girl,&quot; to which Talbot smiled, blushed and than asked, &quot;So what are we going to do? Stick around here or go downtown and bum around?&quot; a feeling of suddenly wanting to get out and see if other people thought him to be a girl.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Echo told him, &quot;Let's go downtown for awhile,&quot; to which Talbot nodded and walking over to her, he took her hand and allowed himself to be led out of the room, unaware that anything was off.</p>
