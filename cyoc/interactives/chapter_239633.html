<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The writhing mass of latex twists and shifts, molding itself to his form, accentuating every monstrous contour of his body. His frame seems to grow even larger, more imposing, as the black liquid swirls around him, merging seamlessly the surface of his skin. The light of the Blackstone reflects off the undulating material, casting flickering shadows that make the room feel alive with a sinister energy. <br />
<br />
Orion tilts his head back, his glowing blue eyes flaring brighter as the transformation continues. His voice, now muffled and distorted by the latex surrounding him, carries a chilling edge of ecstasy.  <br />
<br />
“Yes… <b>YES</b>!” he exclaims, his words dripping with unholy fervor. “Do you see it?! The fusion of man and the infinite! This is what lies beyond humanity’s frailty—beyond <em>your</em> frailty!”  <br />
<br />
The latex coils around his outstretched arms, stretching and lurching, bulging with growing muscle His entire form glistens in the Blackstone’s glow, a horrific vision of power incarnate, as though he has become the physical embodiment of the artifact’s will.  <br />
<br />
You struggle against your bindings, but the oppressive gravity and the pulsating energy of the Blackstone make even the slightest movement feel impossible.<br />
<br />
As the Blackstone’s booming pulses grow stronger, the chamber seems to warp around him, the very fabric of reality bending to his will. The air crackles with raw energy, and you feel it pressing against your mind, threatening to drown you in its overwhelming presence. <br />
<br />
Then, a low, rumbling voice cuts through the oppressive silence, smooth yet edged with malevolence.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Ahhh…~</em> It feels good to be whole again.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Fully engulfed by the swirling black latex, Orion Morgenstern lowers his gaze to meet yours. His smile cruel, his teeth gleaming through the living darkness that clings to him like a second skin.  <br />
<br />
“Witness me,” he growls, his voice reverberating through the chamber with an almost divine authority.<br />
<br />
And witness, you do.<br />
<br />
His body gleams like oil under the sparse light, every inch of him a terrifying, rippling masterpiece of raw masculinity and unnatural perfection. His form <em>towers</em> above you, an embodiment of power so absolute it seems to dominate the very air around him. The latex coating his body gleams like polished obsidian, catching the sickly-blue glow and refracting it in haunting patterns that ripple across his frame. <br />
<br />
Beneath his angular snout, his chest rises and falls slowly, the expansive, sculpted musculature of his pectorals heaving like an engine of barely contained force. The light plays along the contours of his torso, highlighting every line and curve of his chiseled abdomen, each muscle perfectly defined, as if sculpted by the Blackstone itself.<br />
<br />
His face is no less striking, a grotesque yet mesmerizing mockery of draconic features. His new snout curls into a mocking smirk, fangs glinting faintly beneath the latex as his glowing blue eyes bear into you. But, it’s not just two eyes anymore. Below his primary pair are smaller, slitted eyes, faintly glowing with the same sickly-blue light, their gaze cold and unblinking—and at the center of his forehead, a third eye opens—a swirling orb of pulsating blue light that seems to peer directly into your soul, its malevolent glow sending a shiver down your spine.  <br />
<br />
Behind his head, writhing tendrils of black latex undulate in a grotesque, serpentine dance, extending from beneath his long, curved horns. They move with a disturbing sentience, as though responding to the pulsing energy of the Blackstone, twisting and coiling in a rhythm that feels almost alive. Each tendril glimmers with the same oily sheen as his body, occasionally splitting into smaller threads that whip through the air before merging back together.  <br />
<br />
Then, you flinch as he tilts his head back, a low, guttural groan escaping his throat, a mix of a hiss and a growl that reverberates through the chamber. His glowing, sickly-blue eyes flicker with a strange, predatory pleasure as his clawed hand moves, trailing deliberately down the sculpted lines of his chest. The gleaming latex clings to every ridge and curve, squeaking faintly as his fingers glide over the defined musculature of his pecs, down to the chiseled symmetry of his abs. Each movement is unhurried, purposeful, as though savoring his own perfection.<br />
<br />
The faint squeaks grow louder as his hand reaches his hips, the light catching on the slick, flawless surface of the rubbery material that encases him. His movements are shameless, his confidence exuding a raw, magnetic allure that feels impossible to ignore. And then, his clawed fingers trail lower, brushing against his dangling, swaying member, large, ribbed and serrated with spines, heavyset balls squeaking and gurgling with seed. His hips shift subtly, and he exhales another deep groan, his expression one of utter satisfaction.<br />
<br />
“Do you see now, serpent?” he rumbles, his voice rich with mockery and triumph. “Perfection is not an aspiration—it <em>is</em> me. The vessel of the Blackstone, the god you were too blind to bow before.”<br />
<br />
His wings, now fully unfurled, spread wide with a resonating <em>snap</em>, their jagged edges glistening like wet tar. The latex coating them stretches and shifts with his movements, producing a faint series of squeaks and creaks that only amplify his unnatural allure. They loom behind him like the shadow of a god, vast and imposing, completing the monstrous image of his ascension.  <br />
<br />
Then… you watch, as Orion raises a massive arm, the black latex that encases his sinewy muscles gleaming in the pulsating light of the Blackstone. The movement is deliberate, the writhing tendrils behind him swell and twist, filling the space with their grotesque dance, as his clawed hand curls into a fist as he flexes his bicep, the rippling muscle swelling beneath the glossy, rubbery surface. The sound of the latex stretching and shifting is subtle but distinct, the faint squeak echoing in the cavernous chamber like a sinister melody.  <br />
<br />
His eyes, all six of them, glint with amusement as he watches your reaction, a cruel smirk curling along his angular snout.<br />
<br />
Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he tilts his head, his elongated, serpentine tongue slipping from between his fangs. It trails wetly along his glistening bicep, tracing the curve of the rubbery muscle with an agonizing slowness. The latex squeaks faintly beneath the touch of his tongue, the sound teasing, mocking your struggle to maintain composure.  <br />
<br />
The sight hits you like a wave, a fog creeping into your mind despite the ironclad walls of your defiance. It’s not just the grotesque allure of the blatant self-indulgence—it’s the way he exudes control, the way he knows exactly how to unnerve and weaken you. The latex encasing your body seems to tighten, pulsing faintly in rhythm with the Blackstone, as if responding to the conflict raging within you.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Magnificent, isn’t it?&quot; He purrs, his voice dripping with smug satisfaction. He lowers his arm but doesn’t step back, looming over you with that predatory smirk still etched across his face. &quot;Power unrestrained, a body perfected. That pull, that… <em>desire.</em> You fight it, yet it coils around your mind like a serpent, hissing its temptations in your ear... how fitting.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Your mind reels as you struggle to shake the fog, to push back against the insidious allure of his presence. But every detail—the gleaming latex, the unnerving sensuality of his actions—seems designed to chip away at your resistance.  <br />
<br />
Leering down at you, Orion takes a slow, deliberate step forward, his towering form radiating dominance with every move, the sway of his maleness, the slosh of his sack. His soles, encased in the same gleaming black latex as the rest of his monstrous body, strike the metal floor with wet, rubbery <em>sllrp</em> and <em>sllrch</em> sounds.<br />
<br />
Your eyes, despite yourself, flicker downward, drawn against your will to his feet. The latex stretches taut over the broad expanse of his soles, glistening under the eerie blue glow of the Blackstone. Each splayed claw flexes as he walks, the tips clicking lightly against the ground in calculated precision. The wet sheen of the black rubber covering his feet gives them an almost otherworldly allure, their perfection as much a statement of power as the rest of his godlike form.<br />
<br />
“Marveling at me, are you?” Orion’s deep, mocking voice cuts through the haze in your mind. His smirk widens, fangs glinting as he notices the direction of your gaze. “Even a creature like you can’t help but admire true divinity.”<br />
<br />
He stops just a few feet away, planting one foot firmly in front of you. The sole presses against the floor with a wet <em>sllrch,</em> the sound ringing in your ears as though it were amplified by the pulsating energy of the Blackstone. His claws flex again, the gleaming rubber creaking faintly, exuding an effortless sense of control, dominance, and worthiness.<br />
<br />
“These,” he says with a dark chuckle, lifting his foot slightly and letting the claws splay out fully, “are the feet of a god. Every inch of this form—this perfected vessel—is the future of humanity. Stronger, superior, and unburdened by the frailty of flesh.”<br />
<br />
Your serpentine eyes narrow as you fight the fog clouding your mind, a growl rumbling low in your throat. But even your defiance falters under the overwhelming presence of the being before you. The rubbery sounds of his movements, the sickly allure of his transformation, and the oppressive weight of the Blackstone’s energy press down on you like a vice, testing the limits of your resolve.<br />
<br />
“Look at you,” Orion continues, his voice low and dripping with contempt. “Even now, you can’t take your eyes off me. It’s instinctual, isn’t it? To bow, to submit, to recognize what you could never be. But don’t worry, little serpent; soon, you won’t have to fight it anymore… Soon, you’ll understand the joy of servitude to something greater.”  <br />
<br />
He steps closer, his latex-bound foot landing with a sharp <em>sllrp</em> as he leans down, towering over you, his multiple eyes locking with yours.<br />
<br />
Every word, every sound, every movement reinforces his supremacy, leaving you struggling to hold onto the last shreds of your will, the surges of a giggly haze threatening to overcome you.<br />
<br />
Yet despite his words, despite his overwhelming aura, something stirs within you—a flicker of resistance, of defiance. You feel it rising, small but steady, an unyielding refusal to submit to the monstrous vision before you.</p>
