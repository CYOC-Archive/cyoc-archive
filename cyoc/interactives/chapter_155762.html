<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the second morning in a row Sophie woke with a fuzzy recollection of the previous night. As consciousness returned the first thing she became aware of was that something was in her ass. The second was a extremely uncomfortable bloated feeling in her stomach. <br />
<br />
Identifying that her legs were tangled with someone else&#39;s and an arm was draped over her, she realized she had a guy spooning behind her with his dick up her butt.<br />
<br />
Opening her eyes, she startled to full alertness. Her stomach was impossibly bloated, ballooned out larger than a beach ball. It was spherical and jutted out two feet in front of her. She tried to scream but her mouth wouldn&#39;t move.<br />
<br />
Hefting herself to a sitting position (and causing her lover to pop free from her back door), her terror spiked further as she noticed dark lines crisscrossing her body, bulging her skin like giant black veins.<br />
<br />
Her terror faded, replaced by an unnatural calm. She looked about and realized she was in a tent. Memories of the twins and their threesome came flooding back.<br />
<br />
She looked at the guy who had been spooning her. He did not remotely resemble the burly ex-soldiers she had seduced the night before. <br />
<br />
This kid looked younger, probably late teens. Thick unruly auburn hair cascaded down to his shoulders. His face had a soft jaw and chin with not a hint of facial hair, full red lips, and a small cute nose. If Sophie had looked at just that face she would have been hard pressed to guess the gender, and probably would have said girl. His body was soft and smooth, just as hairless as his cheeks. All muscle tone was gone, chest flat with wide light toned areolas around his nipples. His hips had a feminine flair with a soft bouncy butt. The guy&#39;s genitals were unchanged other than the overall hair removal.<br />
<br />
A thick rope of dark flesh bulged along his spine, leading to a mass the size and shape of a large lemon at the base of his skull.<br />
<br />
Looking around the tent, she saw a matching girly boy sprawled naked by the tent flap.<br />
<br />
Information flooded her mind. She had done this to the twins, fucking and draining them for a twofold purpose. The mass she had sucked out of them had fuelled the growth of the thing inside her. It also allowed the puppeteer which had grown along their spine and into their brains. Testosterone was poison to it, and they could only be controlled once they were largely free of its influence.<br />
<br />
They were hers; mind, body, and soul. She knew she could drain them further and it would deepen her control, but would also erase more of their individuality - they would become extensions of herself.<br />
<br />
The terror she had felt earlier returned, but again she was unable to act upon it. She also felt herself get turned on, as a dark part of herself reveled in what she had done.<br />
<br />
Sophie tried to scream, tried to tell the twins to run away. Instead she heard her voice calmly say. &#39;Wake up, it&#39;s time to move. I need a dark place with abundant water.&#39;<br />
<br />
As they both stirred, she realized she could feel them. She knew their thoughts. She found herself digging into their memories. The overpowering compulsion to find water drive her further. The brothers had left the trail yesterday to try and swim in a pond. The water had been too thick with algae, but they had found a spot where a sinkhole had made a shallow cave in the shore.<br />
<br />
The twins got to work packing up their supplies. Sophie&#39;s body was on autopilot, waddling over to her gear. As she got fresh clothing out of her pack she remembered something. <br />
<br />
She avoided thinking the word or picturing the object. She slid her hand into the pocket of yesterday&#39;s pants. Her hand closed around something hard and cold. <br />
<br />
She had the revolver clear of the holster before the force inside her could respond. Barrel pressed against her distended midsection, a battle of wills occurred inside her head. Slowly her finger took up the slack in the trigger and the hammer creeped back. The black strands under her skin seemed to pulse as the creature fought for control of that all important finger.<br />
<br />
The contest of wills became a stalemate, the hammer was half cocked.<br />
<br />
Gently Sam put his finger into the gap between the hammer and frame. Firing obstructed, Daniel pried the gun from her hand.<br />
<br />
As he took the revolver, he spoke for the first time that morning. His voice was high and feminine. &#39;I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;ll thank me for this once you have finished becoming.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sophie wasn&#39;t sure if it he was speaking himself or if it was the creature using him as a mouthpiece.</p>
