<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Behold the countenance of vengeance!&quot; proclaimed Mr. Neville Barclay <br />
as he held his mask in one hand, and grinned triumphantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the heck are you?&quot; James said earnestly. &quot;I've never seen you <br />
before in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; roared Neville, &quot;You and your heathen friends destroy my life, <br />
and you don't even recognize me! This is unconscionable!  I mean <br />
what's the point of revenge if the people against whom you're seeking <br />
revenge don't even realize who or why vengeance is being meted out <br />
against them?&quot; <br />
Neville buried his face in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! You're like Sideshow Bob on the Simpsons, but I swear I don't <br />
know who you are, mister. Sorry,&quot; James said as the villain sobbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sorry?&quot; Neville said angrily raising his head up to  stare in <br />
disbelief at Jamie. His voice rose in intensity, &quot;YOU ARE SORRY!  Oh, <br />
my boy, you have no idea how sorry you and your comrades will be!&quot;<br />
<br />
James glanced over at Zack and whispered, &quot;Just like Sideshow Bob, <br />
right, Zack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhuh,&quot; mumbled Zack in assent.<br />
<br />
This made the villain even angrier. He flailed his arms in the air <br />
against unseen assailants. He roared unintelligibly. <br />
<br />
At last he calmed down a bit, and spoke, &quot;I am not this kid's cartoon <br />
character of which you speak.  Though I saw part of an episode with <br />
this Sideshow Bob of whom you speak at the Sanitarium before the <br />
orderly turned it off. Too violent, and not conducive to mental health <br />
recovery, or so he said before he turned in professional wrestling.&quot; <br />
Neville sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I suppose the years have not been kind to me, and I probably <br />
do look like half the man I used to be.  When you knew me, I still had <br />
all my hair,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I had tenure.  I had a girlfriend.  We were <br />
engaged to be married. I even had a dog.  But you little boys <br />
conspired to take that all away from me.  So, do you remember now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Pertwee?&quot; James asked tentatively.  The guy did sort of look <br />
like his sixth grade teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you've got to be kidding?  Do I look like a woman? Wait, do you <br />
mean you nasty brats destroyed another tenured teacher's life, and <br />
sent her to a sanitarium? Oh, I'm doing a greater service to humanity <br />
that I realized.  Here I thought I was just seeking a modicum of <br />
justice for myself, but now I discover that you've destroyed countless <br />
other lives.  Alright, maybe not countless, but at least one other. <br />
Tell me about Mrs. Pertwee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, she was our sixth grade teacher, but we were all pretty sure that <br />
she used to be a he.  You know like Mr or Mrs. Garrison on South Park. <br />
She wore a big theatrical cape-coat, and carried a cane. She was too <br />
tall to be a real woman, too gangly. Kinda like that giant model on <br />
Tosh.0 the other night. Any chick that big has to be a guy, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the insensitivity,&quot; lamented Neville, &quot;Do tell me more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after they took her away in the ambulance. I never saw her <br />
again. Mr. Turnbull took over classes for the rest of the school year <br />
on October 1st. Though we did have a series of substitute teachers for <br />
him. He was technically our sixth grade teacher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Villains,&quot; said Neville distastefully. &quot;How many other teachers did <br />
you vile little creatures go through over the years?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
James was had figured out that the man holding them was a former <br />
teacher, but he didn't know who it could be. So he was stalling, if <br />
this was like an episode of the Simpsons, then Lisa should arrive with <br />
Chief Quimby and his policemen at any minute. He felt bad making up <br />
all that stuff about Mrs. Pertwee. Mr. Turnbull had been his sixth <br />
grade teacher. Pertwee had been the teacher the year before who <br />
retired before they got there. She had been a short doughty woman. <br />
James had instead imagined Dr. Who's Jon Pertwee in drag as he <br />
described the teacher he had never had.  He needed to string this <br />
weirdo along until the guy either realized he had the wrong kids or <br />
James figured out who he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er. You know I've never counted,&quot; James answered, &quot;Lessee there was <br />
Pertwee, and the O'Connell sisters.  I can't remember which one walked <br />
in front of the train and which jumped off the train bridge...&quot; he <br />
lied.<br />
<br />
Neville had gotten a notebook and started writing. He had to get the <br />
whole story before he did anything else.  How many lives had these <br />
monstrous children destroyed, beside his own?<br />
<br />
&quot;Suicides?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, sure,&quot; said James caught off guard, &quot;Suicides, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please! They weren't suicides. You murdered those hapless sisters <br />
who merely wanted to educate you unspeakable little children,&quot; his <br />
voice reeked of disdain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you're more like one of the Harry Potter villains than the <br />
Simpson villains,&quot; James said thoughtfully, &quot;Definitely not a <br />
Voldemort, but maybe a Snape or Malfoy...or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! The villains you describe cannot compare to your own <br />
villainy. They were fictional.  You are real - though soon you'll be <br />
fictions. I wonder, perhaps I've cast you and your friends all wrong. <br />
No way should Andy be immortalized as Superman - maybe General Zod.  I <br />
think maybe I'll do over the Chamber of Horrors with each of you evil <br />
boys redone as a wax monster. Art should reveal your true souls - <br />
which I'm beginning to doubt you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, just don't do me as Ned Flanders as the Devil with doughnut-<br />
headed Homer,&quot; said James. It felt as if the grip of Superman holding <br />
him was starting to slip, maybe James' body heat was melting some of <br />
the wax, or maybe the wax hand was separating from the wax wrist. He <br />
struggled silently, as Neville harangued the air with epithets. <br />
<br />
James was pretty sure that this guy knew who Sideshow Bob was, and <br />
knew that he always failed in his dastardly vengeful plans. Just the <br />
mention of the Simpsons sent him into a rage now. James figured he was <br />
on the right track, but he still had no idea how to free his friends <br />
or himself at this point. He needed a Lisa Simpson or another plot <br />
device to get out of this.  It might be too much to hope for that the <br />
villain would reveal everything including how to defeat him and free <br />
all his victims.  Still, he was still ridiculing the Simpsons, if <br />
James just pushed the right buttons, maybe, just maybe the villain <br />
would undo himself.  That's the way it always happened on TV right?</p>
