<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen sat there stunned watching the clock race towards the sixty second marker, listening to her heart pound she tried desperatly of what she should say. Just as her time was almost up she said &quot;I choose...&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was too late. She froze as the curse set in, making her freeze to hear her fate. &quot;Wonderful, you didn't answer so you get both. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll enjoy this, as well as all those other jerks on the football team. For the transformation part of the curse, you will slowly become a satyr over the next few hours. The first thing you'll find changing will be your libido. You'll love being constantly arroused and eager for sex. The next thing to happen will be the pheramones. Not only will you increase the sex drive in anyone around you, but you'll find that they'll be more than willing to lay with you. Both of these changes should happen before you get to school, that way the physical changes begin before you actually manage to seduce someone. Anyone you do have sex with will also find themselves subject to this transformation, even the contagious part. Of course, no one will think these changes are anything out of the ordinary, and just for fun no one will even think it's odd if you decide to go without clothing after they start becoming evident. They'll just go about their lives as normal, thinking anything you do to make them believe otherwise is just one big joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
The color drained from Jen's face as she heard all this. Kyle let it sink in for a moment before continuing. &quot;As for your dare, I want to make sure this goes according to my plan so you will be unable to pass along this curse unless I say you can. I've gone to great lengths to get your cell phone number. You'll be recieving a text from me in a second. Save my number. I'll be calling you throughout the day to give you instructions. The first person I want you to seduce is of course your boyfriend Hank. As captian of the football team he'll be able to get to the most of the players the quickest. Oh, and to make sure this happens, you will be going to school today. Enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen heard the line go dead then jumped as her phone beeped, having just got a text. She opened her phone, looked at the text which simply read 'this is Kyle', and saved the number to her contacts. She began to inwardly cry as she grabbed her toaster tarts, got dressed and headed out the door. Getting into her car it dawned on her that she was a tool in some perverted nutjobs plan to take revenge out on the school. Yet she couldnt bring herself to fight it. The senior cheerleader just started her car and drove herself to the highschool.<br />
<br />
On the way she began to feel different. Jen found herself thinking less about the gloom and more about the chance to seduce her boyfriend. That prospect began to take precedance and soon she actually found herself looking forward to getting to school. By the time she was parked and getting out of her car she was even excited about the oppurtunity to have sex with more then just her boyfriend, maybe even at the same time. Her thoughts were now almost purely about sex and her panties were growing increasingly moist. As well as tight for some strange reason. Even her bra was starting to feel funny. But hse paid it no mind as she quickly went to where she knew Hank would be.<br />
<br />
The poor jock never stood a chance. One minute he was talking to his friends at his locker, the next pretending to get a book out to hide an odd erection, then he found himself groped from behind by a pair of very familar hands. He looked behind with a smile, turning in Jen's arms to press his front against hers. &quot;Well hello there. Feeling a bit frisky today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea babe. But I really need to tell you something. I think it's best if we go somewhere a little more private though.&quot; She of course wanted to try and tell him about Kyle's plan, maybe warn him if even a bit. Yet the unintended inuendo didn't slip by her and she knew what he was taking from what she said. Not that she was against that at all by this point.<br />
<br />
Into the lockerroom used only for football practice they grappled with each other. Both exceedingly aroused and attempting to see who could disrobe who the quickest. All the while Jen was trying to get out Kyle's plan. &quot;... and now he's, mmmm... making me change into... something called a, oooh yeah, satyr...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean one of those greek goat men from mythology class?&quot; He nibbled on her neck while undoing her bra, not concerned that her chest felt flatter yet firmer then past sessions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah those... wait goat men?&quot; She fumbled with his belt and ripped open hs buttonfly. &quot;Don't you mean goat people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, satyrs were only men.&quot; He threw her bra into the corner and slipped his thumbs into the waistband of her panties. &quot;They were the embodiment of male lust and abandoment. Classic mythos say there were no satyr chicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm going to become...&quot; Hank nibbled on her neck and shoved both her shirt and undies down, using his knee then foot to push them to the floor revealing a slowly expanding phallas above her vagina. &quot;a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, seems like it.&quot; He broke away for a second to pull off his own pants, revealing his not to shabby 7 incher. Around it's base was a well kept patch of curly browne hairs above a decent set of balls. Jen for a moment was too stunned to do anything, taking in that she would no longer be a girl. But that passed as Hank got on his knees and began to eat out her shrinking pussy and licking up her growing shaft. She moaned and fell back against the lockers letting him have his way, no longer caring about anything but the sex.<br />
<br />
Jen felt her dick expanding in size and soon Hank was giving more attention to it then her fading folds. He turned out to have a knack for giving head and if she didn't know any better she's think he'd done it before. Before long she felt a strange pressure and the urge to give a push. With a soft grunt she felt something drop out of her and suddenly Hank was sucking on two growing balls. This caused her to jump and her boyfriend looked up at her concerned. &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! ... yeah.&quot; She looked down at him an ran her fingers through his hair. &quot;It doesn't bother you that you're... sucking a.. cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MMmmmm, and a nice big one too.&quot; By this point it had grown out to a good eight inches and still seemed to be expanding. Almost as thick as a silver dollar. It was as if the sex was speeding up the change. He ran his tounge up it loveingly. &quot;No, should it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not.&quot;</p>
