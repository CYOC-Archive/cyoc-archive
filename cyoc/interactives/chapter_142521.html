<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait, what?&quot; I asked. Something seemed off about that request.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I know you&#39;re not feeling well, but pay attention. If we want Jakey&#39;s help, we need to help them cum quickly,&quot; Taylor explained. That made sense, but it still felt off.<br />
<br />
Before I could question it more, Taylor quickly jumped into the action, shoving his cock into Jakey&#39;s bubble butt. The platinum blonde twink moaned sexily, making it even harder for me to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something&#39;s... not right,&quot; I muttered. Why could I figure this out?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, come on, you&#39;ve been getting worse ever since you came in the shower,&quot; Taylor stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like me!&quot; Jakey added, giggling uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; I asked again. What was he trying to say?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Chase groaned. &quot;You guys are so annoying.&quot;<br />
<br />
The student council president removed himself from Jakey, despite the twink&#39;s protests. Quickly, however, the blonde got swept up in Taylor&#39;s thrusts and focused on bottoming as best as he could, allowing Chase to stand and look at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, if I tell you what happened, will you just help me get off?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and he began. &quot;Ever since the day before yesterday, every time Jakey&#39;s orgasmed, he&#39;s gotten dumber. He started just being forgetful, but then he basically forgot that he forgot things. Then, he started liking that he was getting dumb and got even worse. Now, he&#39;s basically a lost cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you just let him jizz his brains out?&quot; Taylor asked, still pounding away at Jakey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I didn&#39;t want to deal with that shit. By the time I realized it was an issue, it was too late. Whenever I even tried to bring it up, he&#39;d get horny about it and he&#39;d wanna fuck. And why the fuck would I stop him?&quot; Chase explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I&#39;m gonna be like him?&quot; I asked, completely confused. My head was starting to hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, who the hell knows? There&#39;s one way to find out,&quot; Chase stated. He walked up to me so that he was boring his eyes into me. I noticed that the dude&#39;s formerly  blue eyes now had specks of purple in them and I got lost in them.<br />
<br />
Of course, that was only until he loudly proclaimed his next sentence. &quot;You are nothing but a dumb, slutty twink.&quot;<br />
<br />
His words hit me like a truck and I felt my heart skip three beats. Without warning, my already hardened rod strained and twitched until I was overwhelmed with an orgasm. As I came, Jakey came with me and I felt connected with him in an inexplicable way.<br />
<br />
Before I could keep thinking about that, cum flowed from my dick like a river, and Chase got on his knees to take it all. The sizzling in my head felt all too familiar as I clutched my head from the minor pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re both clutching their heads,&quot; Taylor noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause they&#39;re both gonna be dumbsluts,&quot; Chase responded. I think Taylor said something in response to that, but I couldn&#39;t hear it. Chase&#39;s comment sent me into another orgasm, which brought me to my knees.<br />
<br />
By the time I recovered, my three friends were all licking the cum off the floor, and it looked hot. I wanted to join them, but something still felt off.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, that was so hot!&quot; Taylor yelled, looking at me with a hunger in his eyes. &quot;You telling me that if I keep saying stuff like that, he&#39;ll keep having that same reaction?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. Now, you made a promise to me,&quot; Chase stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dude,&quot; Taylor replied. The redhead then looked at me. &quot;Come on, I want fuck him senseless.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took every bone in my body to resist the two of them. Before they could say another word, I bolted out of the room, not even daring to look back. This time, I would leave. I didn&#39;t care if they sent me to some government lab or even shot me. I had to escape.<br />
<br />
Before I could go, however, I figured that I would need to go to my room. I had no idea why, but there had to be something that would help me escape, right? Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure. My mind felt so cloudy.<br />
<br />
I barged into my room, slamming the door behind me. I must&#39;ve looked like a wild animal as I searched for something that would help me escape. There had to be something that could help me!<br />
<br />
I trashed my drawers, looking for tools. Ugh, did this thing only have clothes in it? How useless!<br />
<br />
My desk and bed seemed to be no further help. Just when I had given up hope, my eyes focused on someone lying on the ground. Ryan&#39;s weights! He&#39;d left them here. I could use them as a weapon! How had I not thought of that before?<br />
<br />
I dashed to the other side of the room, and grasped the 60 pound weight with one hand. However, no matter how hard I tried, it wouldn&#39;t budge. Even after using both hands, it barely moved. Had I got weaker? I thought I had gone to the gym only yesterday.<br />
<br />
The lighter weights didn&#39;t seem to be much help either. In desperation, I used whatever muscle I had left to lift the lightest weight. I didn&#39;t even know why I needed it anymore, but I still pulled like my life depended on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need a hand honey?&quot; a light voice asked. I stopped and turned to find Daniel staring at me with a smirk on his face. Did he always seem so confident and... sexy?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please!&quot; I begged, resuming my efforts. Instead of helping me, however, he simply slapped my left butt cheek, forcing me to stop once again and get lost in the intense pleasure I felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t see me for, like, an entire day, and that&#39;s how you greet me?&quot; he asked. &quot;Tsk, tsk, tsk. Totes rude.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at him, still bent over with my ass sticking out. I didn&#39;t realize before, but he looked different. Just like the rest of us, he&#39;d shrunk a lot. No one would think that our group had become close by going to the gym. None of us looked like we did more than cardio and swimming. He was naked, just like us, and his body hair was gone, too. Because of that, I didn&#39;t even realize at first that his hair color had changed. Gone was the plain, black look. His hair was now a bright blue and was styled in a fade. Honestly, it looked pretty cute. Plus, I couldn&#39;t tell from here, but I knew that his ass had to have become as big as mine. Overall, I couldn&#39;t help but get hard as I looked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello D-Daniel,&quot; I stuttered. Fuck, he looked so hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Danny, hon,&quot; he ordered, squeezing my ass. &quot;It&#39;s totes cuter.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and he continued. &quot;Damn, you got the pink hair one. That one&#39;s, like, the worst. I&#39;m sorry hon. Well, not really.&quot;<br />
<br />
Worst? &quot;Whuddaya mean?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, like, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed, but your hair color kinda determines what kind of twink you&#39;ll be. It&#39;s basically how your body reacted to the virus. Black and dirty blonde are both emo, platinum and strawberry blonde are both dumbsluts, and most of the other colors just represent different kinks. For example, brown hair means you&#39;re totally a cute sub, whereas blue hair means you love domination and corruption. Don&#39;t ask me why, it&#39;s just how it works,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But pink. Pink is, like, the worst one. Pink takes the worst ones to a new level. You become dumb just like the lighter blondes and become submissive, too, but it&#39;s totes worse. At least Jacob -- sorry, Jakey -- will regain some intelligence towards the end. You, on the other hand, will need help counting to ten,&quot; he stated. His words sent a chill down my spine. I definitely didn&#39;t want to have pink hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll probably be ready to take anyone&#39;s orders from now on as long as it doesn&#39;t, like, get you killed. And if all that wasn&#39;t bad enough, you&#39;ll also start producing these totes hot pheromones,&quot; Danny continued. &quot;Once it&#39;s fully developed, everyone around you will act twinkier when they smell it, but even subs will want to dominate you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how do you know all this?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Danny simply pointed to his head. &quot;Blue hair. Remember what I said about that color? Like, of course, you don&#39;t. Basically, I&#39;m, like, the opposite of you. I make the people around me more submissive and I got smarter with my changes. Plus, I&#39;m fully aware of everything that&#39;s changed and I get off on it. Not to mention, I&#39;m almost as horny as you, and you&#39;re totally the horniest type.&quot;<br />
<br />
He began feeling up my ass and playing with my member. &quot;You guys were, like, total assholes before, you know that? Such homophobes and so full of yourselves because of your girlfriends. I bet you all even thought I was, like, gay, too? It made you shy away from me. Well, I wasn&#39;t, but I totes would&#39;ve been if I&#39;d known how good it would feel. Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;d unconsciously made sure to spread the virus throughout the dorm. I didn&#39;t even realize it when I jizzed in all the stalls that first day and made sure my hands were covered in dried cum when I came back to play video games with you guys. To be honest, it was a nice little payback, though I couldn&#39;t have hoped for better with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, I was having difficulty understanding what he was saying. I was getting so much information thrown at me and Danny&#39;s hands made concentrating very difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? You got something to say?&quot; Danny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; I whimpered. I was able to remember what I had wanted before, I couldn&#39;t even bring myself to say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You want me to let you go?&quot; he asked. That was it! I nodded my head. &quot;Alright, on one condition: you gotta grant me three wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had absolutely no idea what he meant by that, but I also knew that I wasn&#39;t understanding much at the moment. Danny was my friend, however, so I figured he would definitely help me out. I nodded to him, and his smirk grew even larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then,&quot; he began. &quot;I&#39;ll even give you the chance to leave early if you answer my questions correctly. First question, how many judges are on the supreme court?&quot;<br />
<br />
What? I didn&#39;t understand what he was talking about, but I felt like I should&#39;ve known the answer. After all, I was studying something like that in college, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, 6?&quot; I guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, bud, it&#39;s 9. You might have to change majors when we get out,&quot; he told me. &quot;So, for my first wish: CUM!&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately, my senses overwhelmed me as my cock exploded. I practically drenched Ryan&#39;s weights by the time the sizzling began. As it happened, I could feel bits and pieces of my memory fading. Worse, it felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; a voice said. I felt so proud, hearing those words. &quot;Now, what&#39;s 9 times 9?&quot;<br />
<br />
Was that a science question? I was never good at those. It didn&#39;t help that Danny&#39;s hands were making it sooo difficult to concentrate.<br />
<br />
&quot;True?&quot; I guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong again, hon. It&#39;s 81, not that you&#39;ll remember that. Now, CUM AGAIN!&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
Once again, I felt soooo good as my cum came out of my cock. I dove for it once it came out because I love cum sooo much. It tastes great!<br />
<br />
But then, my head started to hurt and I couldn&#39;t tell why, but it was okay but because it soon passed. I looked up and my friend Danny was smiling at me. I felt so proud. &quot;Good boy! Now, my final question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny stopped talking. It felt like it was for that thing. Drama affect?<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; he asked, slapping my ass again.<br />
<br />
Damn, that felt sooooo good. Fuck, what did he ask? What was my name? Fuuuuck, what was my name?<br />
<br />
I tried concentrating really hard on his question. I knew I had to remember it. It was on the tip of my tongue. It was right there. It was --<br />
<br />
I felt a cock touch the entrance of my boypussy and I completely forgot everything. It felt AMAZING... Wait, what happened? Why wasn&#39;t he fucking me? And shouldn&#39;t I not want that?<br />
<br />
Wait, what about the question? I... I didn&#39;t even remember what he asked. All I could say was, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, honey. It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll tell you after my wish,&quot; he told me. &quot;And for my final wish: CUM AS HARD AS YOU CAN!&quot;<br />
<br />
FUUUUUCK! I came so hard! Delicious cum flew everywhere, but I gobbled most of it up. Mmm, so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did a great job!&quot; Danny told me, petting my head. I was so happy. &quot;You&#39;re name, honey, is Slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slut? Was that right? I felt like it was something different before. I looked at Danny&#39;s eyes. There were bright blue, like his hair. He was my friend. He wouldn&#39;t trick me. That meant...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; I mumbled. My name is Slut!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, do you still wanna leave?&quot; he asked me.<br />
<br />
Leave? Leave where?<br />
<br />
&quot;You look so cute when you&#39;re confused,&quot; Danny commented. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s take you to your master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my master!&quot; I said. I was proud that I knew that.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, honey, I couldn&#39;t stay tied down to one man. Even if I had a harem it wouldn&#39;t be enough. There are probably a lot of pink haired men like you, but there are only a few blue haired twinks like me. I need to help change the world,&quot; Danny said. What did he mean?<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t worry. Last I saw, Taylor was still a redhead, which means you&#39;ll be in good hands,&quot; Danny explained. I&#39;m so confused.<br />
<br />
I felt thirsty, but I realized that I already drank all the cum. I looked over and saw that Danny&#39;s cock was hard. I love hard cocks! I wanted to suck it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later, Slut,&quot; Danny said, not letting me suck his cock. &quot;As much as I&#39;d like to break you in, that would be Taylor&#39;s right. Actually, let&#39;s take you to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
A hand pulled me up and we left my room. Then, we got to a door and Danny opened it. My friends were behind that door!<br />
<br />
&quot;You lost your sub. Don&#39;t do it again,&quot; Danny said, looking at Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What happened? What&#39;s going on Danny?&quot; Taylor asked. He was fucking Chase. I wanna join!<br />
<br />
Danny whispered something into Taylor&#39;s ear. I couldn&#39;t hear them, but as Danny talked, Taylor started looking more and more hungry. I wanted him to fuck me sooo bad. In fact...<br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor, please fuck me! I want your cock sooo bad,&quot; I said. I stuck my ass out at him and wiggled my butt to help him out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, works for me,&quot; Taylor said, pulling out of Chase. He looked at me. &quot;Ready, Slut?&quot;</p>
