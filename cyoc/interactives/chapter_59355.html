<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brock led Jeff to the kitchen, Jeff's chocolately footprints continuing to leave a trail on the tiled floor until finally the air conditioning cooled Jeff off enough for him to remain solid. &quot;Good,&quot; Brock said as he grabbed Jeff's arm. &quot;You must be hard enough now. We don't want you to melt away into a big puddle.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Brock may have been referring to the solidity of Jeff's body, Jeff couldn't help but think of the possible other meaning for &quot;hard&quot; and instinctively looked down to his crotch, imagining that Brock could see Jeff's hard-on in his shorts, though the chocolate shorts did effectively keep his genitals compressed or merged into his body. But just thinking about his genitals in this way caused him to bring them back without even trying; thus, his shorts vanished, leaving him naked below the waist, with a growing hard-on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, yummy,&quot; Brock said staring at Jeff's cock. &quot;But lose the shirt too.&quot; Jeff shrugged and the rest of his clothes merged back into his body. Brock smiled in approval at the sight of Jeff's naked chocolate body, saying, &quot;Man, I could just eat you up. Here, lie down.&quot; Brock gently pushed Jeff down onto the kitchen floor. Jeff would have thought a bedroom would've been more appropriate, but Brock didn't want to risk getting chocolate stains on bedsheets or the rug. Brock crouched down next to Jeff. &quot;Usually with a chocolate rabbit, the first thing to go are the ears,&quot;  Brock told him and began licking Jeff's chocolate ears. &quot;But that's only because a rabbit's ears are long and poke out. It's not your ears I've got my eye on.&quot;  Jeff immediately knew what Brock was referring to, and his cock twitched involuntarily.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Brock began working his way down from Jeff's right ear. First, he licked his way down to Jeff's neck and nibbled off a bit of the chocolate there, as if giving Jeff a hickey. Jeff found that sensation to be unexpectedly arousing and his cock was getting even harder. Then Brock moved down Jeff's neck to Jeff's chest, licking a trail of chocolate as he went. Near the bottom of Jeff's pecs, Brock paused as he focused on Jeff's right nipple. Brock took Jeff's nipple into his mouth and started sucking the chocolate bump for all he was worth. &quot;Mmm, tasty,&quot; Brock said. &quot;I just want to bite it off, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, no,&quot; Jeff said, barely able to keep his head enough to deny Brock's desire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spoilsport,&quot; Brock told him. Staring at Jeff's chest, though, it was apparent that his right nipple was now smaller than this left nipple. As if to balance things out, Brock then moved over to Jeff's left nipple and gave it the same treatment, licking and sucking at it until it was the same size as his right nipple. Then, when Brock was done there, he licked his way over to between Jeff's pecs and worked his way down to Jeff's belly button. But he didn't stop there. He proceeded down where Jeff's faint &quot;treasure trail&quot; of hair had become thin strands of chocolate that vanished as Brock's tongue ran over them. Brock continued down to the inevitable location where Jeff's rock hard cock was waiting for him.<br />
<br />
Brock grabbed the tip of Jeff's cock and licked down the side of it, ending up at Jeff's balls. &quot;Mmm, I love chocolate with nuts!&quot;  Brock took Jeff's chocolate balls into his mouth and began sucking them for a while until he had thoroughly tasted them. He then stood up to reposition himself between Jeff's legs, taking off his shirt as he did so, in order to avoid getting chocolate on it. Jeff wasn't gay and yet... he found himself becoming more aroused now that Brock's muscular well-toned chest was on display. If he was going to have a gay encounter (even though Brock said it didn't count as gay), at least it was with someone with a manly body. <br />
<br />
And then Brock put Jeff's cock in his mouth and Jeff stopped thinking about anything but the incredibly pleasurable sensation. Of course, Jeff had just recently masturbated himself to conclusion, so he wasn't expecting to be so easily aroused, but Brock was incredibly skilled as he licked and sucked. Brock seemed to be so in love with the taste of Jeff that he just kept going, until it seemed that Jeff might be close to coming at which point, he would pause and wait a bit before resuming. Jeff was enjoying this thoroughly, but he started to worry as he saw small trickles of brown molten chocolate dripping from the corner of Brock's mouth. Just how much of Jeff's chocolate body was permanently gone into Brock's mouth? This thought of concern was enough to push Jeff over the edge and he came, spewing hot cocoa into Brock's mouth, which he greedily swallowed until finally Jeff was done.<br />
<br />
Brock sat up and said, &quot;You were delicious! How was it for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff just stared at his groin. While his cock was still roughly the same shape, it had gotten a lot smaller and thinner than it used to be, like a well-used popsicle (or perhaps fudgesicle).</p>
