<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The image of Dr. Andrew&#39;s hulking form flashed across Diego&#39;s mind, causing his massive manhood to gush a wad of precum that fell to the floor with an audible splat. Just imagining the pure size and power of the enormous doctor, and more importantly imagining growing even bigger than the doctor, was almost enough to get Diego to cum on the spot. He went to grab his thick tool but was met with resistance as his arm and chest fought against each other. Diego took the moment to clear his head. As much as he wanted to just blast cum nonstop, he had a bigger goal in mind, quite literally. <br />
<br />
Over the next week, Diego began to formulate a plan based on what he knew.<br />
<br />
Diego knew now that it is possible for someone to be reinfected by the contagion. He flexed his arm as best he could, unable to bend his arm much past 90 degrees as his massive bicep pushed against his vein-crossed forearm. &quot;Clearly,&quot; he smirked at himself as he took the moment to revel in his sheer size.<br />
<br />
He also knew that it was possible for the virus to mutate, which he as hoping would happen when he was infected by Mr. Dearborn&#39;s strain, but so far apparently not. Come to think of it, Mr. Dearborn wasn&#39;t really getting taller himself. Maybe his strain wasn&#39;t predisposed ot height.<br />
<br />
So then, Diego figured, his best bet would probably be to find someone who was getting taller.<br />
<br />
But who?<br />
<br />
Everyone in his classes right now had basically been done with the contagion for a while and were less likely to be contagious, aside from Mr. Dearborn. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Mr. Dearborn, as the days went on, Diego continued his daily blow job sessions with the teacher, and in the process got an up close and personal look at the changes the contagion was causing in the previously awkward and gangly teacher.<br />
<br />
A few days after Diego first noticed he was re-infected, Diego stayed as usual ater class. He began to approach Mr. Dearborn but took his time to take in his build. the teacher&#39;s former runner&#39;s build was already being replaced by a lean fitness model&#39;s body. His plain, some might say nerdy, button down shirt had visibly filled out on his torso, threatening to become tight in a few places. But even though it wasn&#39;t too tight to button, though, Mr. Dearborn had taken to wearing his shirts with the first few buttons undone. The wide fireplug stared at the cleavage between his teacher&#39;s pecs that seemed to grow deeper every day but his eyes were drawn upward when Mr. Dearborn spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gonna keep me waiting long? Or am I gonna have to come over there and get you myself?&quot; Mr. Dearborn said in his new baritone. A day or two ago his voice had finally broken. It surprised several of the students in the class, and seemed to turn on more than a handful. Diego also noticed the change in his teacher&#39;s demeanor. Each day he seemed to get a little more aggressive, likely from the sheer amount of testosterone flooding his body from his contagion enhanced junk.<br />
<br />
At his teacher&#39;s behest, the short monster wasted no time unzipping Mr. Dearborn&#39;s pants. His hard cock sprang out, already glistening with precum. Diego licked its length, lapping up his precum, but only caused more to gush out in the process. Before long the massive high schooler had Mr. Dearborn&#39;s whole tool in his mouth, feeling his tip reach deeper than ever before. Diego estimated he must be close to 10 inches by now.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for the increasingly muscular teacher to blow his load. He grabbed Diego behind the head and thrust his cock down the double-wide student&#39;s throat, taking Diego by surprise and cumming straight down his throat for the first time. He tried to back off but was held in place by the aggressive teacher&#39;s firm grip. Load after load was being shot directly down Diego&#39;s throat, each one as large as a regular man&#39;s entire orgasm, and each one larger than the day before&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Finally the fitness model teacher&#39;s orgasm subsided and he let go of Diego&#39;s head. He wiped off his mouth as Mr. Dearborn began putting his still hard dick away, barely regarding Diego, his sexual needs having been sated for the time being. <br />
<br />
Diego was about to exit the door when a knock came and opened it first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this Mr. Dearborn&#39;s office?&quot; a small reedy voice said. A small Asian-looking boy came through the door. He was small and skinny. Even a little shorter than himself, Diego thought.<br />
<br />
Once the door was clear, Diego let himself out, not paying attention to the conversation behind him and he headed home.<br />
<br />
Once Diego got home he took his measurements again. As he weighed himself, he found that he had gained another 15 lbs, butting him at 300 lbs of pure, rock hard prime beef. He thought hitting the 300 lb mark would be a joyous occasion, but it felt like a hollow victory as he took his height and saw that he hadn&#39;t grown even a centimeter taller. The frustration was beginning to overtake him but still fueled his desire to grow. But now Diego was facing another problem: His mobility. As he packed more and more mass onto his small 5&#39;4&quot; frame, he was truly starting to feel musclebound.  He was startinbg to have difficulty lifting his arms above his head as his traps and delts fought for space. He could even feel his traps touch his ears if he tried hard enough, though he reckoned he wouldn&#39;t have to try in a few more days. But he also couldn&#39;t lower his arms all the way, prevented by his ever widening lats and his triceps the size of hams. His pecs had long since blocked out his view, but now he was having trouble even tilting his head down as his chin would meet the enormous globes he called pecs. And walking was becoming more like waddling as his thighs were running out of space to move around one another.<br />
<br />
Part of him was afraid that he really could become too massive. But the other part of him was so turned on by his growth. His gigantic tool was also still growing, now probably even thicker than a wine bottle, it had also gained an inch in the past week, Diego guessed. He couldn&#39;t quite reach to measure it any more, but it was starting to poke the underside of his pecs.<br />
<br />
Diego began rubbing his monster cock as best he could. This time images of not only Dr. Andrews, but also Mr. Dearborn danced through his mind. He had to admit, he originally began blowing Mr. Dearborn just for his contagion, but as he grew not only more muscular but more masculine and domineering he was coming to genuinely enjoy sucking the teacher off and feeling his cock longer and deeper each day as it grew too. Diego threw his head back as far as his over-developed traps would let him and released the largest orgasm he&#39;d ever had up to this point, covering much of his bathroom sink as well as himself.<br />
____________<br />
The next day, the musclebound monster lumbered into Mr. Dearborn&#39;s class and was interested to find the small Asian kid from the day before in the class. He must&#39;ve been infected and sent to the contagion wing, Diego figured. &quot;This should be interesting&quot; he mused as he switched seats to sit next to the much smaller boy.<br />
<br />
Throughout the course of the class, Diego discovered that the new kid&#39;s name was Ryan Nakamura. His parents are both Japanese, though he&#39;d never been to Japan, and he&#39;d inherited his small stature from, well, both of them. No one in his family was tall or large by any means, and his family was very concerned about what the contagion would do to him.<br />
<br />
Diego and Ryan really hit it off and seemed to be well on their way to becoming fast friend. And they were quite a comical pair at that, with Diego being almost as wide as Ryan is tall.<br />
<br />
When they got up to leave however, Diego noticed that whereas Ryan was shorter than him the day before, Ryan was already standing at almost the same height as himself. A smile crept across his face as a plan crystallized in his mind.</p>
