<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was insane...! People didn&#39;t just randomly grow goatees out of thin air, or- This headband definitely had goat ears at the start, right!? Mark gave his horns another ineffective tug, rubbing his head sorely afterwards. Had someone spiked his drink? Not likely with it being a can... Maybe he was overheating? Whatever was happening, he needed to get somewhere private and figure out what he was going to do next-<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you it was real fur!&quot; once again, a voice spoke up excitedly behind Mark. A moment later, he felt a hand firmly plant itself on his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damnit Chase, would you ease up on the-&quot; Mark spun around, expecting to see the upperclassman. Instead his fellow pledges Travis and Peter were excitedly standing behind him. Their eyes were traveling up and down the length of Mark&#39;s body, sizing up his outfit. Mark felt himself do the same thing. The two had clearly stayed behind at the frat house, and made costumes that vaguely resembled cowboys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry guys. I thought you were uh...&quot; Mark&#39;s train of thought drifted off as Travis continued to rub his rear. &quot;What  do you think you&#39;re doing back there...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry! We saw you across the room, and we just had to come get a better look!&quot; Travis grinned. &quot;Peter, seriously, feel his fur!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other pledge stepped forward, planting his hand on Mark&#39;s thigh. &quot;Oh wow, you&#39;re right! It does feel nice.&quot; He grinned. &quot;How much did this thing cost you Mark?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark could feel the two&#39;s hands slide over his legs, curling around each strand as they explored his legs. &quot;I uh, it actually was a surprisingly cheap rental and I uh....&quot; His voice drifted off as he felt something brush up against Travis&#39; hand.<br />
<br />
His classmate beamed, &quot;Is the tail real too?&quot; He slid his hand over the appendage, brushing the fur as it squirmed beneath his grasp.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s eyes went wide, &quot;What!? No! I- How are you doing that...!?&quot; He tried to lean over his shoulder to get a better look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing what?&quot; Travis grinned, wiggling Mark&#39;s tail back and forth. &quot;Pete, you have to see this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s hand chose that moment to slide on the inside of Mark&#39;s thigh. &quot;I&#39;m enjoying the view up here thank you very much.<br />
<br />
He had this almost loopy grin on his face. Travis had it too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are... are you two drunk?&quot; Mark tried to take a clop back, but that only pressed him up further against Travis.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, we just got here.&quot; Peter licked his lips. Oh jeez, his tongue was practically hanging out.<br />
<br />
Mark tried to squirm free from the two, &quot;Well this has been fun guys, but I should really go mingle some...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Travis asked over his shoulders. His hands had resumed freely groping Mark&#39;s ass. &quot;Everyone&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked up, and to his astonishment, nearly everyone in the room had come over to watch. A few were reaching out to try and touch his fur, and someone nearly managed to grab onto one of his- err, his costume&#39;s horns. They all had the same goofy look on their face. Mark was still trying to place it when he saw one of the zombies ogling him.<br />
<br />
The zombie was wearing an old pair of purposely torn sweat pants. They didn&#39;t do much for the whole zombie aesthetic, but they did let Mark see what was going on between the guy&#39;s legs. The frat boy had a massive hard on.<br />
<br />
Thing suddenly clicked into place. Everyone in the room was extremely horny.<br />
<br />
For him.<br />
<br />
Peter chose that moment to finally reach up and grope his crotch. The pledge&#39;s fingers slid firmly over Mark&#39;s furry sheath, tracing the outline of his manhood. He was grinning in amusement, holding it up like a trophy, &quot;Hey guys, I found goaty&#39;s best part!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark let out a flustered gasp, &quot;Oooh, it&#39;s a satyr costume actually! I&#39;d be more than happy to show it to you if you all stop- Baah!&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, Travis had decided to tug up his tail. &quot;Have you guys seen his ass? I&#39;m usually not into guys, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
What had gotten into everyone...! Mark tried to break away from the two, just barely managing to slip out of Travis&#39; grip. He lost his balance though, and flopped right onto the crowd of onlookers. They were eager to resume the two pledge&#39;s work, and Mark quickly felt a dozen hands on him.<br />
<br />
He let out a flustered moan as he felt another squeeze on his unmentionables. &quot;Ooh! Hey, uh, you know what...!&quot; Mark ducked down, turning in place to slip out of everyone&#39;s grasp. He broke away from the group, looking down at the gaggle of randy college kids, &quot;I uh, I think I&#39;m going to go change...!&quot;<br />
<br />
His hooves let out a clatter as he booked it toward&#39;s the room&#39;s entrance. Someone let out an enthusiastic, &quot;But you&#39;re perfect like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
He could hear a few people try to follow him, but Mark quickly rounded the corner into the back of the house. He needed some place to hide, and all this clopping around wasn&#39;t exactly discrete. Mark quickly scurried into the house&#39;s kitchen, scanning for some place to lay low. He opened the door to the back yard, but could already hear footsteps approaching. Keeping the door open, Mark quickly hopped in the walk-in pantry, shutting the door behind him. Maybe that would slow them down.<br />
<br />
He could hear a few muffled voices on the other side of the pantry door. &quot;I think he went outside!&quot;<br />
<br />
What had gotten into them!? Either his friends all had a side to themselves that they weren&#39;t letting on, or there was something seriously weird going on tonight!<br />
<br />
Mark flicked on the pantry light. He frantically reached down, doing his best to tug his pants off.<br />
<br />
Instead, he found himself letting out a loud, startled bleat. &quot;Baah! What the hell?&quot; Tugging on the pants really hurt...! He let them go, doing his best to keep his voice down.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that no one had heard his little outburst, Mark looked down, trying to figure out where the pants might have snagged on his legs. Instead however, he just found fur. Thick, brown, fur. He gave it another tug, feeling a sensation startlingly close to pulling on his own hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; He blinked, running his hands over his waist. The sensation felt good, but it was also a bit distressing. There should have been a definite seam between his goat legs and his human torso. Instead, the fur merely tapered off as it encroached upon his top half. His formerly hair-less chest was now littered with stay strands of unkempt brown scruff. As he ran his fingers over it, Mark was having trouble figuring out if it was hair or fur. It was impossible to tell where the goat ended and the human began anymore. He was just all satyr.<br />
<br />
&quot;This... this is impossible...!&quot; Mark leaned against a shelf, pulling up one of his legs. He hardly recognized it. There should have been a big lump where his toes were balancing on the hooves, but instead his legs just tapered off until they got impossibly thin around his hooves. Even his ankles looked like they were in the wrong place...! He gave the cloven lump a tug, trying to pull it off his foot again. It didn&#39;t budge an inch, and Mark realized he couldn&#39;t really detect any feeling in his toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah...!&quot; He let out another animalistic bleat, quickly reaching up to his horns. There still wasn&#39;t any trace of the headband holding them in place, and just as he suspected, they were still firmly attached to his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got to- Baah! -get out of here...!&quot; Mark clopped back over to the pantry door, his mind reeling. How was this possible!? How was he going to fix this!? What was he going to... to... What was that weight between his legs?<br />
<br />
Mark blinked, looking down between his furry legs. Peter had spent the better part of the last five minutes rubbing his crotch, and it clearly showed. Peeking out of his costume&#39;s- err, his sheath, was a thick black goat cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah...? What the...?&quot; Mark reached down, experimentally touching it.<br />
<br />
It immediately responded. Mark felt a rush of excitement wash over him, and for the moment his escape plan got pushed to the back of his mind. His manhood was easily the width of a beer can, and sensitive to the smallest touch. A few more inches slide out of his sheath as he teased himself, showing no sign of stopping.<br />
<br />
Baah, maybe this wasn&#39;t all bad.</p>
