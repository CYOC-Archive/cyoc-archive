<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">20 minutes later Raelene, now ‘Liz’s” twin was dressed and was putting make up on. She said to Maureen. ‘Could you help “Liz” get into the outfit I have put on the bed? I don’t want her to be seen in public looking like that’<br />
<br />
‘Hey I don’t need to be seen in public’<br />
<br />
‘Of course you do. We are on holiday. Are you just going to spend the week in this hotel room? The tour starts tomorrow night. We’ll be going as Roger and Maureen. Are you going just stay here on your own?’<br />
<br />
‘Well no…. I’ll come… Only I’m meant to be Roger’<br />
<br />
‘Clearly you are not going to be Roger. Equall clearly I need to give you some fashion guidance. What you are wearing just isn’t right. That T-shirt was only in my bag to wear over my leotard if I went to the gym. I certainly wouldn’t wear it out for dinner. And as for the slacks. I would advise not wearing pale coloured slacks when you are on your period. Especially when you don’t have a proper pad’<br />
<br />
‘But all you have is dresses and skirts. I can’t wear a dress. These trousers were the only ones in your suitcase’<br />
<br />
‘Why can’t you wear a dress? That body looks good in a dress’<br />
<br />
‘Because I’m a man and men don’t wear dresses’<br />
<br />
‘Sorry Liz. Look in the mirror. You’re a woman. Your having a period and women having periods wear skirts. If you have a leak your problem is hidden’<br />
<br />
‘I don’t understand your problem. You wore a dress on the plane’ added Maureen<br />
<br />
‘I had no choice. I certainly wasn’t going to just wear Liz’s underwear. Now I have a choice’<br />
<br />
‘Okay. Fair enough. Have your choice but I claim the right to veto it’<br />
<br />
Half an hour later Roger found himself in a blue dress and a navy jacket. He figured the jacket somehow hid his ample breasts. He was not sure he approved of how short the dress was but at least the colour was wearable, it wasn’t floral or lacy and his cleavage was not on display.<br />
<br />
He found himself walking down to the lobby in a pair of Liz’s anklet boots. The only reason he was coming was because “Raelene” had agreed she would buy some jeans that “Liz” could wear during her week in that body. <br />
<br />
The concierge informed the three ladies as to the location of a nearby shopping mall. He assured them it was only a short walk.<br />
The first thing they did was visit a supermarket. There Maureen and Raelene explained to “Liz” the pro’s and cons of feminine hygiene products. Liz walked out of the shop with boxes of Everyday and Maxi pads and a box of tampons. He immediately visited the ladies toilets and inserted a maxi Pad (just to be sure) as Raelene had described. His panties were quite stained. He was now grateful he had not continued to wear the beige trousers.<br />
<br />
Next they found a department store and selected a pair of black women’s jeans. They seemed to be extremely tight fitting but Raelene assured “Liz” they were the correct size. Maureen purchased replacement panties for “Liz” and they discarded the soiled panties into a rubbish bin. <br />
<br />
They then went out for dinner. ‘Liz’s preference had been that they ate via room service back at the hotel but Maureen and Raelene were having none of that. “Liz” was outvoted. They walked to the seaside and took a table at an open air café. Feeling the breeze blowing against his panties “Liz” was grateful he had changed them. After a couple of glasses of wine “Liz” finally began to relax.<br />
<br />
Over dinner Maureen once more explained why it was best to act according to the body you were in. ‘If you are in Liz’s body you are Liz. If you were in this body’ she pointed at herself ‘You would be Maureen. I would expect you to behave as Maureen. You would be Roger’s wife’<br />
 <br />
‘I get it. We have to keep up appearances in public’<br />
<br />
‘Yes we do. And tomorrow night we start the tour. You are clearly not going to be Roger. One of us will have to fill the role of being Maureen’s husband. You will be Liz Maguire. You will be a woman travelling on her own, in company with her best friend and her husband of coarse’<br />
<br />
‘I get it’<br />
<br />
‘Well I hope you also understand why Maureen and Roger need to share a room and Liz has her own room? There can’t be any slip ups. I’m not gay and neither is Liz. Have you realised that yet?’<br />
<br />
‘Realised what?’<br />
<br />
‘That while you are in that body you are attracted to men?’<br />
<br />
’I’m not!’<br />
<br />
‘You are’ <br />
<br />
‘You sure are’ said Raelene ‘It’s how that medallion works. You have my tastebuds and sexual preferences’ <br />
<br />
‘I don’t’<br />
<br />
‘Are you sure? Check out that man on the table behind you. At the end with the green polo on. I dare you to tell me you don’t find him attractive’<br />
<br />
‘I don’t’<br />
<br />
‘You haven’t even looked. Walk up and pretend to look at the desert menu. Check him out as you do’<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was the wine “Liz” had drunk. He took up the dare. He immediately discovered who Raelene had been talking about. The guy was slim, tall and dark haired, your typical Spanish gigolo type. “Liz” forgot to look at the menu and the fellow caught the eye of the pretty redhead who was checking him out. He gave the woman a smile. Not that he had not noticed her and her twin sister earlier.<br />
<br />
“Liz” found himself blushing in embarrassment. He had reacted to the smile. He turned and returned to his seat.<br />
<br />
‘Well?’ asked Raelene<br />
<br />
‘Can you remember anything listed on the menu?’ Asked Maureen  <br />
<br />
‘Okay he was hot!’ admitted “Liz” The other girls had a laugh at “Liz’s” discomfort.</p>
