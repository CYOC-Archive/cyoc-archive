<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy&#39;s flight had been canceled, so he had to spend another night at the convention hotel for his business trip. There wasn&#39;t much to do, so he hit up a nightclub/bar that boasted live entertainment.<br />
<br />
He settled in at a cocktail table at the establishment ordered a drink, and surveyed the room. As long as he was stuck here for a night, maybe he could find someone to keep him company in his hotel room.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was an attractive, single guy. Ruggedly handsome at 38 years old. He had a neatly trimmed beard, and dressed well. He was fit, and proud of his body. It usually didn&#39;t take much for him to get the attention of a lady--or even the occasional gentleman--who caught his eye on his business travels.<br />
<br />
But the crowd here was decidedly couples. He read the flyer on his table about tonight&#39;s live entertainment. &quot;The Magnificent Maurice.&quot; A magician? Kind of lame, but who knows. Maybe he could blow Jeremy&#39;s mind with some amazing Illusions.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes a portly 40-something man, short, balding, and wearing tux that made his belly a little too pronounced, came waddling out from behind the curtain. Tufts of chest hair came out the top of his unbuttoned collar, where his shirt seemed to be a size too small, so that the guy couldn&#39;t even wear a bow tie. The Magnificent Magic Maurice wasn&#39;t much to look at, and he didn&#39;t even have a lovely assistant. His tricks were cornball card tricks, colored clothes he pulled from his clothes. And everything he did, he assured the audience, &quot;Would Amaze and Astound.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a total dork,&quot; Jeremy muttered. He began to cycle through his phone. Maybe a dating app could direct him toward some real fun.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the spotlight shone directly on Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have an audience patron, staring down at his phone instead of up at the magic, ladies and gentlemen! A most unfortunate faux pas!&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience murmured with mild amusement. Jeremy put his hands in front of his eyes as he glanced up. &quot;Christ, why is he singling me out?&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry good sir, what was that comment?&quot; The Magnificent Maurice struck a dramatic pose with his hands on his hips. &quot;Are you not enjoying the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s great, really,&quot; Jeremy said sarcastically. &quot;But I don&#39;t want to be in the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s where the magic happens!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy groaned. &quot;Look. This isn&#39;t the kind of live entertainment I expected in a place like this. Maybe you ought to be entertaining at children&#39;s birthday parties or something. No offense.&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience laughed.<br />
<br />
The grin faded from Maurice&#39;s mustached face, and he blushed a little. &quot;Well. Someone doesn&#39;t believe in magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy grinned. &quot;Maybe we can make your act disappear.&quot; The crowd roared with laughter, and Jeremy felt a sense of smug satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we&#39;ve got ourselves a heckler, folks!&quot; The magician sneered. &quot;Maybe you want to come up here and show us how it&#39;s done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly buddy, I just want to enjoy my drink,&quot; Jeremy lifted his glass. &quot;Cheers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I don&#39;t drink,&quot; Marvelous Maurice said. &quot;But I do enjoy a treat now and then. For example . . . .&quot; He flicked his sleeves and a small sucker appeared in his hand. He showed it to the audience. &quot;Who doesn&#39;t enjoy a lollipop now and then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy rolled his eyes. &quot;You definitely should be entertaining children.&quot;<br />
<br />
The magician slowly unwrapped the sucker, revealing a red sphere of candy. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I intend to.&quot; He opened his mouth, slowly inched the candy toward his tongue, and gave it a slow, deliberate lick.<br />
<br />
As soon as the magician&#39;s tongue touched the candy, Jeremy instantly felt a warm, wet presence in his pants, gliding along the head of his cock. He sat up in surprise. His penis engorged with blood, and he suddenly had a raging hardon under the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just love to suck on a lollipop, don&#39;t you my friend?&quot; The magician sunk the sucker into his mouth, and suckled.<br />
<br />
Jeremy moaned with surprise. &quot;Holy shit.&quot; It felt like he was suddenly getting a blow job inside his pants.<br />
<br />
The magician twisted the sucker in his mouth. Slowly, methodically pulled it in and out, through his lips. Jeremy closed his eyes, desperately tried to hide his pleasure. This wasn&#39;t possible. Was this guy psyching him out. He didn&#39;t even find him the least bit attractive, with his stocky build and unkempt chest hair poking out of the top of his unbuttoned dress shirt. And yet when he opened his eyes and saw the magician sucking the candy, he could feel every warm, wet, slick contour of his tongue. He felt the tips of his mustache tickling the head of his dick. &quot;Oh God, stop. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, what?&quot; Magic Maurice chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m just enjoying a treat. Say maybe you could come up on stage and learn a little more about magic. Maybe you&#39;d enjoy the show more if you came up here. What do you think ladies and gentlemen?&quot; The audience began to clap and encourage Jeremy to go up on stage.<br />
<br />
He burned red with embarrassment. He couldn&#39;t stand up now. He was majorly tenting his khakis. If this kept up, he might even start leaking precum. Everyone would see. &quot;I . . . I really think I should go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Maurice&#39;s voice came out strong. Commanding. &quot;You&#39;re not allowed to go. You want to be part of the act.&quot; He popped the sucker back in his mouth, and slid it around, then pulled it back out again.<br />
<br />
Jeremy moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You MUST join me on stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy&#39;s head swam with both pleasure and a strange kind of vertigo. He felt his arm sand legs comply with the magician&#39;s command. He pulled his chair back and stood up. Sure enough, his raging erection pressed outward, forming a huge obvious bulge. The audience erupted with laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well!&quot; the magician chuckled. &quot;You may not like the show that much, but you sure like something you&#39;re seeing.&quot; He gave the lollipop a quick suck, and pleasure coursed through Jeremy&#39;s body. &quot;Come on up on stage, I think you&#39;ll enjoy my next trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy wandered over to the stage, his hardon pointing the way. Everyone was laughing. Pointing at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step on up, sir!&quot; The stock magician, reached down with a pudgy hand, and Jeremy found himself reaching up. Allowing him to be helped up on stage, though he was certainly tall enough that he didn&#39;t need the help. He stood, so close to the man that he hardon almost pressed into the bottom of his beer belly. The magician was about a half-head shorter than Jeremy. He smelled like aftershave lotion and candy. A red cheery candy sucker smell which wafted off his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around, my friend.&quot; The magician manhandled him, and spun him to face the audience. He stared out but the faces seemed lost in the bright lights. Shadowy people chuckled and made comments under their breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name, my friend?&quot; the magician asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy,&quot; he said. and his voice cracked a little. He felt so helpless, so totally humiliated standing erect, under some strange spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how old are you Jeremy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 38 years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said, my act was fit for children, is that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;Your magic is . . . impressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who wants to see just how impressive I can be?&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Jeremy I want you to look into my eyes.&quot;</p>
