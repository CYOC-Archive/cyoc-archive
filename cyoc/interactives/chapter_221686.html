<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Avery, you dork…” Avery’s thirteen-year-old young brother, Hunter, cursed, “… you freaking idiot, why did you leave your phone outside and just off and disappear?”<br />
<br />
It was getting late, the summer sun starting to set behind the tree line of the forest behind the house, Hunter shivering in his T-shirt and shorts as the warm summer air started to give way to an evening cold front. Dark clouds started to obscure the waning sun, promising rain soon.<br />
<br />
Hunter knew Avery was a homebody, and it wasn’t like him to just leave for the entire day during the summer without a word. It was even less like him to leave without his phone. He and it were attached to the hip, the nerdy Avery on it almost constantly, playing games or looking through Tic Toks. In fact, Tic Tok was still open when Hunter found it, a newly uploaded video looping on the screen.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what?” Hunter huffed, eyes fixed on the screen as he watched the looping video of his brother making out with a deer, his face and body bloating out to ridiculous, animalistic proportions. His body writhed and cracked, shifting into the form of a deer as another buck mounted him, fucking the humanity out of him!<br />
<br />
It was a joke, it had to be. Maybe some sort of weird new filter or CGI. “This is Avery’s account? He uploaded it!?” Hunter gasped to himself as he scrolled down the screen, finding the comments just as bewildered as he was - some shocked, some titillated. There were already millions of views on the video, and somehow it was sponsored too, a “Brig’s Hunting Co.” ad promising an exciting hunting season coming up in their area this fall.<br />
<br />
Hunter knew this was staged, it just had to be. Maybe Avery had been practicing video editing behind his brother’s back, getting good enough to create this elaborate hoax. That had to be it… people couldn’t just turn into animals, right? Of course not. The only answer was “no”.<br />
<br />
CGI. Got it. That had to be it. But why would Avery make a video like this? The subject matter made Hunter queasy, having to watch his brother take a dinosaur-sized buck dick to his ass over and over as the video looped… it was the weirdest thing ever. Initially, Hunter could hardly watch, but as it played again and again, Hunter couldn’t help but listen to the brutal plapping sound of buck meat spanking his brother’s rear. He watched as that giant pink rod of deer pride slipped underneath Avery’s growing tail, his brother’s moaned becoming bleating as everything about Avery became like of the animal that was mating him. If this was a hoax… why would he show himself getting fucked like this?<br />
<br />
Hunter spied a “delete” button down the page, his thumb fingering over it as a pop-up appeared on screen.<br />
<br />
“Delete video? Doing so will void ad sponsorships and revert all changes.” The screen displayed the words like a warning along with a graphic of a silhouette of a deer shrinking and shifting back into the shape of a human.<br />
<br />
“What the hell…” Hunter questioned the phone, his mouth agape with confusion. Was it… implying that it would change someone back. No, that’s silly. It couldn’t have… really happened, right? Avery… didn’t actually change… right?<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a hot snort of grass-scented air grazed across Hunter’s light-brown hair as the startled boy leapt away, falling face first on the grass before rolling on the ground to get away from the sudden intrusion. Once Hunter was far enough away from the stranger, he turned up his eyes to look at it, seeing that right in front of him was a large deer – just like the one in the video, just like Avery had apparently turned into.<br />
<br />
Hunter shot up on two feet, booking it through the sliding patio door and shutting it tight as the deer behind him leisurely stepped up the door, nostrils puffing and fogging the glass as the boy and the deer stared at each other through the window.<br />
<br />
“… Avery…?” Hunter shivered as he stood there safe inside his kitchen, safe from the big animal outside. Safe from… his brother?<br />
<br />
The buck looked just like the deer from the video, a buck, but hardly a buck. It was smaller than the others and had two short antler stubs instead of a full rack of trophy antlers like the animals that were fucking him. Most damning, a pair of glasses still rest precariously on the deer’s nose, useless for an animal, but Hunter had seen them a million times - they were his brother’s.<br />
<br />
Hunter cracked open the window an inch as he spoke to the deer with a shaky voice. “If… that’s you… if you’re my brother. D-do something that would show me it’s you… um…”<br />
<br />
The thirteen-year-old was panicking too much to think of something. He was sweating, a knot forming in the pit of his stomach because just thinking about the idea that his brother turning into an animal, of getting mercilessly fucked by buck until he wasn’t human before made him sick.<br />
<br />
“Speak… s-say something.” Hunter ordered the buck, not sure if the deer could still talk even if he was actually his brother. The animal on the other end didn’t seem to respond, instead he started nudging his nose against the slight opening in the sliding door that Hunter made, the small buck’s tongue peeking out as he licked his wet muzzle, that long cervine tongue grazing the boy’s hand as he tried to keep the door only slightly open.<br />
<br />
“Uagh…” Hunter spat out, unnerved by the sensation of that thick gooey deer tongue slurping along the palm of his hand. He was done with this, he couldn’t stand it anymore! Hunter raised up Avery’s phone, eying the pop-up box to delete the video and change everything back. He knew this was stupid, that there wasn’t any possible way that this stupid deer could be Avery, but he had to know… even if his older brother would hate him forever for deleting the most popular video he ever had on his Tik Toc - even if it meant losing the ad deal with the hunting company – he had to know. The boy scrolled his finger along the screen, ready to click the “OK” button… When suddenly-<br />
<br />
That deer’s muzzle flung open the sliding door and the animal chomped down on the phone. Those herbivore teeth scraped against the glass touch-screen as it was covered in a wad of deer spittle. Hunter tried to pull it away, only for his drool slickened hand to slip off the phone, sending the boy careening backwards on his butt as the deer wrested control of the phone. Hunter looked on as the deer let out a happy chuff, the large creature withdrawing his head from the crack in the sliding door before tilting his head backwards, his muzzle pointing up to the sky as he let out a loud “gulp!”. A rectangular bulge slithered down the buck’s throat, the deer making more loud gulping and glucking sounds as the smooth muscles in his broad throat shoved the phone down further and further until it slipped into the deer’s belly.<br />
<br />
Hunter couldn’t believe it. He shut the sliding door and locked it tight. Outside the buck kept licking his lips like that phone was the best thing he’d ever tasting, legs excitedly trotting in place as he rubbed his neck against the window, peering over at Hunter as the boy ran to the other room to get his own phone.<br />
<br />
“Alright… do I call police, animal control, Mom…?” Hunter asked himself, panting as that uneasy feeling in his stomach got worse. Something in the back of his head was telling him that it was true… that his brother really was that buck, but what could he do? The idea was too crazy to explain, everyone would think he’d gone insane if he were to say it, so who… who could he possibly call who would understand…?<br />
<br />
“Brrrrrr…. Brrrrrr….” Hunter’s phone buzzed, shaking as it received a call. The boy peered at the number on screen.<br />
<br />
“Avery’s phone.”<br />
<br />
Hunter grew pale as if he’d just seen a ghost, but he picked it up immediately anyway. Maybe his brother was okay after all, maybe this was all just a dumb series of coincidences.<br />
<br />
“Lil’ bro, Hiya!” Came Avery’s voice from the phone, his tone happy and saccharine, a slight lisp in his voice that was never there before.<br />
<br />
“Avery, thank Christ you called!” Hunter sighed, huffing out a breath-full of sheer relief. “You’ve been gone all day. I thought I found your phone, but… well… it’s a long story. Anyways, where the heck are you?”<br />
<br />
There was a short pause on the other end before Avery started talking again. “Whatcha mean? I’m right outside, see me?” The dark silhouette of the deer outside the window started shimmying a little as if trying to get Hunter’s attention. “You said ‘Speak!’ and now I’m speaking!”<br />
<br />
Hunter almost felt the need to vomit, shivering on the living room couch as he watched that buck’s shadow move around outside. “Please… stop messing with me, I’m seriously freaked out right now. Just stop the act, alright? Tell me where you really are.”<br />
<br />
There was another pause lasting a few seconds, Hunter holding his breath as the deer outside leapt away from the window, trotting back towards the sliding door before “bonging” on the glass a few times with his muzzle. “I’m right here!” came Avery’s playful sounding voice from the phone. “Let. Me. In. *Bonk* *Bonk* *Bonk*. Lemme in!”<br />
<br />
Hunter picked up his phone and set it on speaker, moving back to the kitchen towards the sliding door just to see the deer’s happy face pressed up against the glass. Against Hunter’s better judgement, he slid open the door and let the buck’s hooves clatter inside.<br />
<br />
“Avery…?” Hunter whimpered out as the deer’s huge body stood there, wiggling in excitement as the animal’s sheer size took up a good eighth of the kitchen’s floor space. “What… happened to you?”<br />
<br />
“I became an influencer!” Avery’s voice said with an excited squeal from the phone. “Hah… I’m popular! Loved! It’s the best thing that ever happened to me, and you made it forever!”<br />
<br />
Hunter shrunk away as the deer’s head dipped down to nuzzle him. That knot in the young teenager’s belly was twisting with pain, and he couldn’t bear to let Avery touch him in this state. He backed up behind the kitchen table, making sure there were plenty of chairs between him and the buck as he took stock of the creature his brother had become.<br />
<br />
Avery was huge – so big that Hunter could walk underneath the deer’s belly, but his features were soft – not very masculine at all. The deer’s muscular edges were rounded off with plush layer of fat and soft fur that seemed to belong to a doe. His rear was so big it would fit better on a horse rather than white-tailed deer! Hunter gulped, opening his Tik Tok app as he started recording a video. If people saw this, maybe he could at least get some proof that Avery had really changed into an animal, maybe people at least would think he was crazy.<br />
<br />
“I… made it forever?” Hunter asked, pointing the phone’s camera towards the giddy deer as the buck tried to navigate his huge body around the table to get to his brother. “What the hell are you talking about…?”<br />
<br />
“Deleting the video would take away all my views, and if you’d done that, then I wouldn’t be a star anymore! I’d change back!” Avery explained as his plump quadrupedal body knocked over chairs, his waggling rear banging against nearby counters, knocking over plates and flowerpots as those hooves crunched obliviously over the remains of their mother’s decorations. “But now, no one’s getting to my phone ever again! I get to be a deer forever and ever, thanks to you!”<br />
<br />
Hunter leapt away as the big deer continued his careless rampage towards him, ducking back into the living room to try to get away from the oddly amorous buck that was once his brother.<br />
<br />
“What!? I didn’t mean to let you eat your phone!” Hunter shakily responded as he tried to keep away from Avery. His brother was so big and didn’t seem to know his size… if he wasn’t careful, Avery might trample all over him on accident. “A-and… Why the hell would you be happy about that!? You want to be stuck as a big, dumb animal?!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes, yes!” Avery gracefully leapt with joy, clearing the distance between him and Hunter as the overjoyed deer cornered his little brother on the couch. “So big and muscly-soft.  Lots of fans and followers! Love – all the time love and sex and… hot, goopy, drippy, rough deer sex!” Avery’s voice on the phone became obsessive, his words drooling with lust as his deer muzzle pressed against Hunter’s cheek, lips gently gnawing on the boy’s skin with a slick, gooey kiss.<br />
<br />
“EW!! GROSS! GET THE FUCK OFF ME!” Hunter shrieked, squirming, kicking, and punching at Avery, all his blows landing feebly against that giant mass of deer muscle and love before him. “YOU’RE SICK! THIS SHOULD BE FREAKING YOU OUT! YOU’RE AN ANIMAL! NOT A HUMAN ANYMORE! A DEER! A FUCKING DEER!”<br />
<br />
“Ugh… Oh God… yes...” A shiveringly sultry voice arose from the other end of the phone. “I’m a deer! A deer! A DEER!” The animal’s whole body started to shake in utter bestial bliss as Hunter berated him for his depravity. The younger brother caught the red gleam of a tapered tip of feral cock “slurp” out the end of end of that white fuzzy cock holster on Avery’s lower belly, that rod of venison thrusting against the air as it pulsed back and forth in his sheath, growing longer with every jab. Hunter kept his mouth shut, realizing that Avery was getting off on being called an animal, but the buck was already too excited.<br />
<br />
“A DEER… DEER DEER DEER, fuck… FUCK ME!” Avery groaned from the phone as his body quivered, his two, huge oblong cervid balls teetering back and forth in the buck’s thick, velvety scrotum, until they clenched tight. A heaping splatter of pearly-white deer cream spurt out from Avery’s buck pride, spraying his little brother with a gooey coating of animal lust.<br />
<br />
“GROSS! JESUS, GET AWAY!” Hunter tried with all his might to claw Avery away, but only succeeded in getting the buck to raise his head as he bleat loudly in delight. Avery’s voice could be heard gasping on the other end of the phone as Hunter’s entire face was glazed with a goopy coating of deer cum, the little brother sitting petrified on the coach as his brother’s inhuman lathers him in load after load of feral bliss.<br />
<br />
It tasted like sweet grass and piss, an acrid musk stronger than anything he’s ever smelt. The air around the boy’s head gets dizzyingly hot, his nerves frayed, overwhelmed with the sensation of tingling goo and microscopic bestial sperm wriggling all over his skin. Hunter weakly brings an arm down to try to rub his face clean but doing that just left an opening for Avery’s muzzle to lock lips with him once again.<br />
<br />
“Unnff. Never came so much ever… ahn…” Came Avery’s voice over the cum-drenched phone, the camera still recording their make-out session. “Hunty… call me a deer again. Call your big brother a slutty animal. It’s… so much better coming from you!”<br />
<br />
Hunter couldn’t say it if he tried, his mouth completely full of buck tongue as Avery assaulted the boy’s tastebuds with a helping of his own buck cum. Hunter wanted to gag but couldn’t with Avery’s tongue stuffed into his tiny maw, that slick, gooey muscle pressing against every inch of his cheeks as his big brother gagged him with the most intense French Kiss in history. Buck jizz was everywhere. The smell and taste was starting to sink into his skin, making Hunter feel hot and ticklish all over as giddy deer above him made out with him like a high school crush.<br />
<br />
“Call me a deer!” The ditzy Avery pleaded to his little brother again from the phone. “It feels so good when you do it! P-pet me. Touch me. Mate me!”<br />
<br />
A lascivious existential need soaked every one of the deer’s words. He wanted… he needed his new body to be worshipped. Avery had been alone, isolated in his short existence as a human. But now that he was an influencer, now that had a body worthy of being loved, he wanted it every second he could get it. The fact that Hunter was his brother just made it better, the contrast in their two forms proving to Avery wanted he wanted more than anything. That he was now nothing but an animal – in body and soul!<br />
<br />
Avery suddenly withdrew his long cervid tongue and spun around, lifting his tail high in the air for Hunter to see his most precious bits. The younger brother was delirious now, almost suffocated by the intensity of that kiss. His head slowly nodded upwards, getting an eyeful of Avery’s deer butt. It was painted white, and it wasn’t just his fur.  A thick coating of cummy goo strained his hide, the remains of dozens upon dozens mating sessions Avery had taken with the other bucks earlier today worn like a trophy on his fur. Oozing jizz dribbled down Avery’s balls, dripping on the living room’s carpet below as the needy deer’s tail twitched and flickered. Avery backed his rear up further and further, kneeling back on the couch towards where Hunter was sitting.<br />
<br />
“Deer… A Deer, deer, deer!” Avery’s sing-song voice called from the phone. “You too! I want you too!”<br />
<br />
The kiss-dizzy Hunter had little time to defend himself as that huge, horse-sized deer butt pressed against him, almost a ton of buck kneeling on top of him, trapping Hunter’s between those cum-soaked cervine flanks.<br />
<br />
“God, please… no…” Hunter faintly mumbled as his body from head to belly was entombed in fuzzy deer rear, the base of Avery’s fluffy tail tickling his brother’s scalp as the boy’s face sank into against that puckered buck butt.<br />
<br />
The teenager underneath the deer felt like he was getting squished by heavy pillows, his whole body drenched in the jizz from many studly stags as sperm tingled and wriggled against his bare skin. Avery shoved his rear back more, slowly waggling his butt to make his brother sink in deeper, his quivering brother cradled in between those hefty buck buns as Hunter’s nose and lips were forced right up against that swollen tail hole.<br />
<br />
The younger brother’s nose and lips sank into that anal ring as it so happily stretched around him, trapping him in a hotbox of deer musk, that ring practically suckling on the boy’s face… slurp… slurp… loudly slopping over him as Hunter’s nose was drawn further and further into Avery’s insides, extending.<br />
<br />
Hunter was growing a muzzle, his nose extruding outwards as if it were being molded like potter’s clay by that powerful, feral anal ring. Hunter’s skin sizzled as his mouth and nose connected, growing wider as Avery bleated and “ooo’d” over the phone at the sensation of using Hunter’s new shaft as a make-shift dildo. Hunter’s body sweat, baked between those hot cervine buns, his torso bending and stretching longer and stronger as his brother’s alluring animal form beckoned every cell in his body to betray their humanity and embrace deerhood. Deer sperm merged with his cells, exchanging prime buck DNA with his, forcing Hunter’s body to reshape into that of the glorious animals that that jizz came from.<br />
<br />
Hunter couldn’t fight it. His screaming mind wanted nothing more than to escape, but his body needed this. Being trapped between Avery’s sperm soaked deer butt felt like being sent back to his mother’s womb. He felt trapped, suspended in warm wobbly flesh as the body around his forced him to change! His arms and legs lengthening and bulked up against his will as they snapped into four leg. Nothing could prepare Hunter for the shock as his hand were stripped away from him, his fingers replaced with black, cloven cervine hooves that pressed against the plump deer ass around him. Changing nerves all over Hunter’s body flooded his young mind with reassurances of pleasure beyond anything he’d ever be able to feel as a human. No matter how much Hunter hated it, he was getting bigger, his muzzle trapped inside Avery’s rear stretching the deer in front of him wider and wider until…<br />
<br />
“Pop!”<br />
<br />
Hunter gasped out of his new snout as Avery jolted forward, thick strands of pearly cum connecting the young brother’s changing form to the older brother’s ass. By now, Hunter’s body had been molded against his will to be the size of Avery’s, his rear painfully snapping and shifting forward as his posture reverted to that of a quadruped’s. Bitter tears strewn down his elongated eyes as fur sprout from every place on his body that the cum touched. Hunter toppled down on his side as he tried to pick himself up on two feet, only to find himself wobbling onto all fours like a giant new-born fawn.<br />
<br />
“A deer!” Came Avery’s sensual voice from the phone. Hunter’s ears swiveled towards it, watching his brother’s lips wrap around the device, picking it up off the table as he held it in his mouth. “Do it. Do it! Do it! Mate me!” The deer bleated through the phone, raising his rear towards Hunter and shaking it in his face.<br />
<br />
Hunter watched in horror as his brother played so carelessly with the only thing tethering him to humanity. The Tik Tok video had been recording all this time, documenting his changes. If he could just delete the video… he could change back! He had to do what Avery said, at least for now!<br />
<br />
Hunter leapt up onto Avery’s rear, shuffling on top of his brother as his entire body underwent another growth spurt. His legs got longer and impossibly more muscular all at once as he suddenly was made to sprawl out on his brother’s back. The deer below him, quaked with pleasure, his posture widening, ready to accept his younger brother into his herd of prime stags. But, one thing hadn’t changed just yet.<br />
<br />
Hunter was like a tank equipped with nothing but a handgun, his throbbing erection was still that of a boy’s – not a proud animal’s. With an entire horsepower of strength, Hunter thrust his five-incher into Avery’s rear, that giant, swollen rim of buck bliss swallowing Hunter’s erection without any fuss, that thick ring of buck muscle massaging him, wanting everything his virgin brother could give him.<br />
<br />
The little brother’s body was on autopilot, the exhilaration of his new, massive buck muscles resting a top Avery’s plush doe-like body forcing him to ram into that lush deer rear with wild abandon! Avery’s rear seemed curated just for him, as If he were made to be mounted by an animal jut his size. It felt better than anything, more intense than any sort of sex he could envision even in his wildest of dreams. For the first time this whole night, he wasn’t afraid. Hunter’s rear plapped and spanked against Avery’s, cum flying everywhere, staining the couches and carpet as their gigantic bodies tore up the whole room. Hunter’s huge feral butt knocked over the television, shattering the screen and stomping the Xbox he used to be obsessed with under hoof. Avery kept cumming, strands of sex-scented deer jizz spurting out everytime Hunter rammed him, those hefty deer balls of Avery’s slapping against Hunter’s still tiny human testicles.<br />
<br />
Hunter gripped Avery’s belly tight, bellowing loudly as his little human cock splurt out baby batter into his older brother’s fat cervine rear. Hunter’s last human cum-shot sizzled against the moist, pink walls of Avery’s animalistic rectum, mixing together with the overabundance of buck cum inside as the last of Hunter’s human children become nothing but lube in the deer’s ass. Avery clenched down harder on Hunter’s cock, gripping it tight with his sphincter as he began thrusting his butt back and forth, rubbing Hunter’s phallic flesh into a raw, slick, bestial pink, forcing it to grow out wider inside of him. All the while, Hunter’s balls no longer burdened by his old human seed started to bloat out to the size of footballs, forming oblong orbs inside Hunter’s long, velvety scrotum as the new stag bucked with carefree bliss.<br />
<br />
Hunter bit down on Avery’s neck, fucking the smaller deer like a beast as their two bodies joined in sloppy, quivering pleasure. Neither of the brother could think any human words as their minds stooped to lowly, primal desires. For a few minutes, they were beasts – unabashedly proud of their huge and sensual statures. They were nothing but avatars of lust, two sweaty beasts wetly slapping together like tomorrow was the day they’d die; in love with each other, in love with being deer.<br />
<br />
Buck cum oozed down Avery’s rear once again, Hunter’s crème puddling in the carpet beneath them as the smaller deer’s cock continued to spray cum and piss all over the living room. Hunter grunted, thrusting powerfully one more time as a thick, gooey cap of sperm slipping into his mate’s rear, plugging Avery with as much warm cervine bliss as he could before pulling off.<br />
<br />
The house shook as Hunter’s hooves hit the ground, the room the two boys had known and played in their entire lives now completely ruined. Avery arches his head back towards Hunter with his younger brother’s smart phone still in his mouth, giving Hunter a wry, lusty smile before turning his head upward.<br />
<br />
“Slurp… Shluck… Gluck…”<br />
<br />
The phone was gone, and everything was as is should be.</p>
