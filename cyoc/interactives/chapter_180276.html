<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">How in the world could Derek explain any of this to people without seeming like a weirdo and immediately getting shipped off to be studied? He could just imagine some weird doctor in his clinic doing all kinds of weird shit to Derek&#39;s dick, let alone his balls. It made him bite his lip and consider whether this was worth the potential nightmare consequences. Derek cupped his chin, looking down at his dick again. He was gonna have to make due with this much larger organ until he could get his chick pleaser back. And he definitely couldn&#39;t let his parents know anything was weird.<br />
<br />
Derek got dressed in a hurry, managing to get his cock to stay down and look relatively inconspicuous against his leg in a pair of jeans. He looked at himself and then shook his head, &quot;I gotta figure out on my own, then, what&#39;s going on here.&quot; He figured that&#39;d be the case. Anything else would---<br />
<br />
&quot;Derek, Ian, dinner!&quot; He winced when he heard the shout from downstairs, remembering how his dad shouted at him from downstairs - seemed like the den room - to keep it down up there. He wondered what had been going on down there. None of his business.<br />
<br />
Derek just hoped that his new, aberrant manhood didn&#39;t act up at all during dinner. Well, it shouldn&#39;t, he thought to himself. He was after all going to be downstairs with family, with no real stimuli to make him have an episode of erection. But then, there was the fact that Derek was a college age athlete, and he knew himself well enough to know his own weaknesses in that regard. He pulled on a tank top and headed downstairs, acting as if nothing was the worse for wear.<br />
<br />
He found himself passing by Ian, and swore the guy looked a little more cut than usual. Maybe Ian had been working out on his own lately. Maybe his diet was improving. Eh, again, none of Derek&#39;s business. Ian turned and grinned a little bit at Derek, &quot;Having some fun in your room, eh Derek? Do you break out the choir for the girls or is that just when you got a mirror and your biceps all lined up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah fuck you, shrimp.&quot; Derek said with a chuckle, figured that Ian would have heard that too. He didn&#39;t see any reason to try and play it off. He was an adult, and he did adult things when he was left to his own devices.<br />
<br />
Before long both siblings walked in to see a large meal lined up on the kitchen table - though both Ian and Derek noticed something pretty odd about it. Even though they had brought in some food today with them, the majority of the food on the table consisted of cooked vegetables, fruits, and starches. Derek tilted his head a little bit, not remembering the last time his folks made a dinner meal this heavy in the fruits and vegetables department.<br />
<br />
It looked like Malcolm was a little bit sweaty, and so was Natasha.<br />
<br />
Malcolm looked at Derek and then over at Ian, seeming to notice something about his two sons, &quot;So, you boys been working out lately? You trying to be as built as your good ol&#39; dad?&quot; Malcolm promptly raised his arms and flexed them, displaying his surprising vascularity and size for his age. He was pretty boisterous for a man in his mid-fifties, though it wasn&#39;t like Ian and Derek disapproved.<br />
<br />
Ian tried to flex his own arms, and Derek followed suit likewise, stating, &quot;One day, one of us is gonna outmatch you, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure about that? Can you hit my bench press marks?&quot; Malcolm retorted with a slight chuckle. Egging his sons on and making them feel a sense of competition. It was how he usually managed these kinds of things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now dear, you boys can make muscles at each other later, when the weights arrive with Jose.&quot; Natasha said, and then gestured to the food, &quot;Let&#39;s nourish those muscles and eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek and Ian both took some beans for protein, as well as salad, corn, and a number of carrots and other nutritious green foods. Derek was honestly surprised as he started chowing down just how much flavor there was in this stuff - usually he had to be badgered to keep up with this stuff in addition to his protein. But now he was chowing down like nothing was wrong at all. He could almost forget the fact a significant part of his anatomy was different now.<br />
<br />
Derek swore he saw Ian just plowing through his food, and he could almost see something like Ian&#39;s muscles slightly puffing up. Were his eyes playing tricks on him? The tone on his brother was also growing a little more he swore he could see.<br />
<br />
But he kept eating regardless. He was for some reason incredibly hungry today!<br />
<br />
As Derek ate, he swore he could see something peering in the window for a moment - but by the time he peeked over and checked in between bites of salad he saw nothing there. At least it didn&#39;t look like a human intruder. It looked more like, oddly, one of the horses from around there. Shrugging his shoulders, Derek decided to just finish what he was eating and maybe then, once the internet stuff got there, look up the local horse herds and such stuff. Maybe it&#39;d do him some good to find out some local lore.<br />
<br />
By the time he was done he could really feel satisfied with his food intake. His body felt strong and like it had actually developed somehow due to the infusion of healthy foods. Ian got up shortly after and said, &quot;Thanks mom, thanks dad! I&#39;m loving the food and the atmosphere here! Can I go exploring around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait,&quot; Malcolm said as he stretched after finishing his own plate, &quot;Until we have a full picture of what our local wildlife and neighbors are like. We&#39;ll see if we can organize a little local get together tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are...are you guys sure I won&#39;t get treated badly at the high school? I mean, I&#39;m bi, and---&quot; Ian started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just make sure and tell us if anything goes wrong,&quot; Malcolm responded, &quot;We&#39;re pretty sure there won&#39;t be much in the way of regressive folks here, but you never know. Don&#39;t let stereotypes shape your expectations of the locals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, if you feel uncomfortable, we have another place out in the city,&quot; Natasha said with a small smile, &quot;If things do take a turn for the stereotypical, just let I or your father know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right, forgot we had that place.&quot; Ian had been there a few times, but mostly when he was much smaller. Mom and Dad were kind of rich, but they didn&#39;t flaunt it half as much as some of the other rich folks did. For one thing, instead of buying ocean front property, they wanted this farmhouse type living arrangement for their next home, and refused ardently to send either Ian or Derek to private school.<br />
<br />
Derek looked around, and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be heading back up to my room. If Jose needs some help taking stuff in from the truck, I&#39;ll head right on out to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Derek left, he heard Ian excuse himself to go up to his own room as well. Derek actually had to move to the side to avoid getting bowled over as Ian rushed up to his room and shut the door fast, locking it behind him. The elder son cringed a little when he noticed a prominent tent on his little brother&#39;s pants. He could guess what Ian was going up there in such a hurry to do - not that Derek had any room to judge him at all.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Malcolm looked over at Natasha and grinned, &quot;You up for another round in our new room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natasha gasped and chuckled at him, &quot;Well, somebody&#39;s feeling lively today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even know why,&quot; Malcolm said as he shrugged his shoulders, &quot;I&#39;m just feeling pretty damn good.&quot;</p>
