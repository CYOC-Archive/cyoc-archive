<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ahh, Joe… I’m gonna have some fun with my new computer” I said to myself, as I stared at my computer screen and viewed the image of my next door neighbor, who was sunbathing on his new lounge chair.<br />
<br />
I was just amazed how easy it was to zoom in to my neighbor and to change him from the little kid into the young, muscular twenty-five year-old man. That was just awesome! I was eager to change a few more of those with my new “toy”. I was just having too much fun with this.<br />
<br />
I decided to lock in my computer to the GEOS 1499-C76 Satellite, which would give me global reach. I could practically zoom in anywhere and see anyone, and change anything or anybody I wanted to. Ooh boy, this was just too good to be true.  All I had to do was decide on the coordinates, and the satellite would zoom in to the location. I could pick any country, city, or region, and zoom in, and see what I would find.<br />
<br />
Before making any more changes around the world, I would have some fun closer to home. I didn’t want to cause an international panic or anything. That would be the last thing I would want to happen, anyway. So, I returned to my friend, Jimmy, and I moved a few houses down the street. Ahh, I spotted two boys, who were playing in the street.<br />
<br />
Both kids were skinny and about 14 years-old. I let the computer scan their minds and fetch their ID’s and their stats.  Both boys were just kicking a soccer ball around on the street.<br />
<br />
One boy was Alex, who was slightly taller and had black hair. The other was Justin, and he was shorter, and he had brown hair. Both were skinny but relatively athletic.<br />
<br />
I decided to listen in on the two boys and see what they were talking about while they were kicking around the ball to each other…<br />
<br />
“Hey, man… Those football bullies were picking on me again all week long…” Alex sighed, as he kicked the ball away.<br />
<br />
“I know…. I hate them… I just wish I were older…” Justin replied.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait to be eighteen…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Then I can drive!” Justin said excitedly, as he returned the ball to Alex.<br />
<br />
“We gotta wait four more years…” Alex said dejectedly.<br />
<br />
“Four more years of hell…” Justin grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Ooh… wonderful!” I thought to myself. I started entering commands on the computer keyboard.<br />
<br />
SELECT TARGET: Alex<br />
<br />
SELECT MODIFICATION: Age<br />
<br />
CURRENT AGE: 14 <br />
<br />
NEW AGE: 18<br />
<br />
I clicked on “START TRANSFORMATION” I leaned back in my chair.<br />
<br />
Justin had just kicked the ball to Alex, when Alex suddenly froze. He stopped in his tracks.<br />
<br />
“Hey! What’s the matter?” Justin wondered.<br />
<br />
Alex stared at him, like he was feeling weird. Then, something else started to happen.<br />
<br />
Alex suddenly began to grow taller! His legs slowly began to grow longer! His arms were growing longer at the same time as well. Luckily, his clothes were adjusting to his growth at the same time, so he wouldn’t burst out of them.<br />
<br />
“Alex?” Justin wondered, as he watched his friend grow before his very eyes. “What… What is going on?”<br />
<br />
“Uhhhh” Alex groaned, as his muscles increased in size, while his torso expanded. The boy grew from 5 foot 6 inches tall to just past 6 feet in height in just a few seconds! Not only that, his arms and legs grew thicker, and all his muscles increased in size at the same time!<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! What’s happening to you?” Justin gasped. “ALEX!”<br />
<br />
“I… Uhhh… Justin….” Alex groaned.<br />
<br />
Then the growth stopped. Eighteen year-old Alex was now looking down at Justin. The young man was now staring down at the teenage boy.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! This is cool…” Alex said, in his baritone voice.<br />
<br />
“Dude! You look like… Like you’re eighteen or something!” Justin said out loud.<br />
<br />
“Ahh man… I feel awesome!!” Alex cheered, as he flexed his muscle. “I’m all grown up!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, man… What about me? I’m still a little kid!” Justin grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Soooo…. Justin wants to grow up, too?” I chuckled, as I looked at the monitor. “Let’s age him to thirty!”<br />
<br />
I entered the new stats on the keyboard for my second target.<br />
<br />
SELECT TARGET: Justin<br />
<br />
SELECT MODIFICATION: Age<br />
<br />
CURRENT AGE: 14 <br />
<br />
NEW AGE: 30<br />
<br />
I clicked on “START TRANSFORMATION” and decided to lean back in my chair. This was going to be fun.<br />
<br />
“How come you get to be all grown up and I’m still a little--…” Justin groaned. “OOOH!”<br />
<br />
“What? WHAT?” Alex asked. “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Justin started to shoot up like a rocket. He sprouted like a weed! The boy began to grow from his 5 foot 4 inch height and he never looked back. His arms and legs grew thicker and wider as his torso expanded in every direction, all at once!<br />
<br />
“Whoaoa… WHOA!” he shouted, as his headed started to rise farther from the ground.<br />
<br />
The boy’s hands and feet practically doubled in size. Justin’s eyes and face rearranged themselves as he aged rapidly. His eyes became more serious as he grew older. He matured rapidly, as his nose, lips and mouth grew as well. A square jaw formed, and he gained a handsome face. Thick eye lashes formed, and a mustache and beard began to take shape. A fine coat of brown hair appeared on his upper arms, his armpits, and on his large, muscular chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh man! Look at you!” Alex gasped. “You’re older than me now!”<br />
<br />
Justin grew to six-and-a-half feet tall, with hair covering his legs and arms. He had a thin beard and a mustache. His brown hair grew longer, and came down to his neck. He looked incredibly handsome and attractive! He looked now like a thirty-year-old man!<br />
<br />
“Ooh man! I’m like thirty now!” Justin spoke in his deep, baritone voice.  He grinned as he walked up to Alex, towering over him by six inches or so.<br />
<br />
“I… Uhh…” Alex began, when he was overcome by that tingling feeling for a second time.<br />
<br />
This time, Alex began a second growth spurt. He began to grow taller as well, and stopped until he had reached about the same height as Justin. He grew older as well, and aged until he was also thirty years old. Black hair sprouted on his chin and across his chest, and Alex was also sporting a beard and a mustache, just like Justin.<br />
<br />
“Dude, we both need to shave!” Justin chuckled.<br />
<br />
“You and me both, man!” Alex laughed. “What are we doing, kicking around a little soccer ball?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, let’s get in the car, and go around the town…” Justin suggested.<br />
<br />
The two men decided to go out and enjoy themselves.<br />
<br />
“Ahh, two more happy customers” I thought to myself. “Who to change, next?”</p>
