<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Dustin’s Power – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty had left to go to the movies, while Dustin stayed home by himself. It was a long weekend, with Labor Day coming up the following Monday, so he didn’t have to go to work. His best friends had all gone out of town, and there was no way Dustin was going out with Ty and Peter, who were younger than him. He wished that he had a friend who was about his age, who was in town. So Dustin just stayed home and watched TV by himself, he was bored out of his mind.<br />
<br />
When Ty and Peter had come home they found Dustin in the same position when they left, sitting in the recliner in front of the TV. Ty was getting tired, but Peter was still wide awake, since had taken a nap that afternoon. He joined Dustin in the living room.<br />
<br />
“Have you been watching TV all day? Why don’t you go out?” Peter asked him. “There’s nobody here, all my friends are out of town and there’s nothing to do. I would like to have some fun, or go do something…” Dustin mumbled. Then he looked at Peter. “My birthday is coming up next week. I would like to do something different.” Peter looked at him feeling a little confused. But then he picked up on Dustin’s thoughts. <br />
<br />
“I know what you want for your birthday!” Peter said out loud. Dustin looked at him with a smile. “I wish I could borrow your powers for a couple of days!” Dustin said to him. Peter thought about it, and figured that he wanted to take a break from always having to think about what he would wish for, and he didn’t mind being a normal kid for just a few days. <br />
<br />
Peter got up and went to his room. He wished for Prince to come, because he couldn’t wish for his own powers to leave him. When Prince appeared in his room, he told him that he wanted to transfer his powers to Dustin for three days. Prince nodded and made it happen so that no matter where he was, his powers would return to Peter in seventy-two hours from that moment. When Prince disappeared, Peter felt lighter. He wished for Dustin to come to his room, but nothing happened! Dustin had his powers now!<br />
<br />
Peter quietly walked back into the living room and thought about Dustin. Without saying a word, Dustin suddenly heard his thoughts and turned towards Peter. “What did you do to me? I can hear you think!” Dustin asked. “You have my powers for the next three days!” Peter said. “Happy Birthday!”<br />
<br />
Dustin got up, and looked down at Peter. He wished for Peter to be taller, and suddenly Peter felt a jolt go through his body, and he noticed his torso was rising up, since his legs began to grow and he became three inches taller. “Whoa! I’m growing!” Peter said, as he now stood there, two inches taller than Dustin. “Ha ha ha!  This is cool! I can change you however I want!” Peter nodded, for he was now just a regular, helpless teenager without any powers at all.<br />
<br />
“Now Peter, you need to be a few years older” Dustin said. Peter gulped, as he started to age rapidly. The fifteen year-old boy now looked like an eighteen year-old young adult and he grew a mustache and a beard! He grew out a little more, and he became more muscular!<br />
<br />
“Hey I’m a man now!” the adult Peter said, as he looked over his tall, matured body! His voice was deeper, and he felt a slight itch all over his body as he became more hairy as well. “How does it feel to be an adult?” Dustin asked his now-adult buddy. “It feels great! So what do you want to do?” Peter asked him. “Let’s go to the night club! You look old enough now!”<br />
<br />
Dustin and Peter drove down to the sports bar where they watched football on the large screen TV and they ate chicken wings. There was a dance floor there, and they got to pick a few college students to dance with. Peter found a really nice blonde girl, who started dancing with him. Of course, she had no idea she was dancing with a teenager who just looked three years older! Afterwards Dustin had a few drinks, and Dustin and Peter went out. From there they went to see a horror movie that was rated ‘R’. Normally Dustin wouldn’t go see an adult flick with Ty, but now that Peter was an adult, he decided to treat Peter to a movie!<br />
<br />
After the two young men returned home, Dustin thanked Peter for hanging out with him. They went to bed around three o’clock in the morning! <br />
<br />
When Dustin woke up the following morning, he went into Peter’s bedroom. When he saw Peter sleeping on the bed, he concentrated and made him slowly transform into a cocker spaniel. Peter’s legs and arms grew shorter and were now covered with long, black hair. Peter’s head turned into that of a dog, and his torso shrunk down to accommodate the rest of him. Dustin loved having the power now, and made sure he got good use out of having it! When Peter had transformed into the cocker, Dustin willed him to wake up. With aloud bark Peter stood up on the bed, realizing that Dustin had now changed him into a dog!<br />
<br />
Dustin went for a walk around the block, with the dog on a leash. Dustin walked through the neighborhood, enjoying the fresh air and the sounds of the singing birds. Peter ran in front of him, enjoying the fact that he was now a dog, and being able to do whatever he wanted without having to worry about what he wished for or thought. <br />
<br />
When Dustin walked by a neighbor’s house, he saw a little 10 year-old boy with glasses playing in the yard. The boy was short and skinny, and he was trying to lift the garbage can. The can was too full and too heavy for him, so Dustin decided to hive him a hand. Dustin wished for the boy to walk towards him, and he came right up to him, as Dustin was standing on the sidewalk in front of their house, holding Peter on a leash. <br />
<br />
Then Dustin concentrated on the little boy, who was only wearing shorts with no shirt on. The boy’s pectorals began to expand, his calves and quads became thicker, his abdominals suddenly popped out of his skin, and little biceps bulged out of his arms. The boy had suddenly turned into a muscle boy! He turned around and he was now able to carry the garbage can with ease! Then Dustin decided to leave the boy like that, and continued walking down the block.<br />
<br />
When Dustin got home, Ty had just woken up. Ty walked up to Dustin, and noticed the black cocker spaniel. “Hey Dustin, where’s Peter?” he asked. Dustin winked at him and pointed at the little, black puppy dog. “What?? Peter turned himself into a dog?” Ty said, with complete surprise. “No, I did that!” Dustin responded.<br />
<br />
Then Ty felt power coming from Dustin! Dustin grinned, as Ty slowly transformed into a dog as well, but a brown cocker. In an instant, Ty had become a dog, and the two dogs began to bark at Dustin. “Alright you two, I’ll change you back!” Dustin said, as he wished for both boys to return to normal. Ty looked at Peter after he was done changing. “You did what? You gave Dustin your powers? But why?” Ty asked him, almost shouting at Peter. “It’s his birthday present!” Peter said, ‘It’s only for three days!” he continued.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at Peter and grinned. “So you don’t have your powers anymore? Good… You know, I always wanted to have a little brother who was ten years old!” And immediately, Peter gasped as he started to grow younger and younger. Peter was now only five feet tall, and he was smaller and shorter than before! All the muscles were gone, for Ty had transformed him into a little ten year-old boy! “Whoa! I was an adult yesterday, and now I’m a little kid!” Peter said, with his high voice. <br />
<br />
“Alright, little boy! Let’s go upstairs and work on our model train, okay?” Ty said, always wanting to have a little brother. ‘Hold it!” Dustin said. Dustin concentrated and little Peter was suddenly floating in the air, as he floated right next to Dustin, who was sitting in the recliner in front of the TV. “I need to add something to this ten year old boy as well, so he can play with the other boy down the street. Suddenly Peter’s muscles began to grow, and Peter was now a little muscle boy!<br />
<br />
Dustin set Peter down using his psychic powers and Ty and Peter went upstairs to Ty’s room. “Don’t you mind it, that Dustin has your powers now, while you are normal?” Ty asked Peter. “Not really, it gives me an opportunity to relax a little. Besides, I’ll get my powers back in two days, no matter what. So Dustin can do whatever he wants! He turned me into an adult last night and we went to the bar!”<br />
<br />
Ty thought it was funny that his powerful cousin was now this little kid. But he decided to change Peter back to his old self. Ty wasn’t really that concerned about Peter, he was more worried about Dustin! Dustin now had Peter’s immense powers, and Ty hoped that Dustin would be careful while using them!<br />
<br />
What would Dustin use his powers for next?</p>
