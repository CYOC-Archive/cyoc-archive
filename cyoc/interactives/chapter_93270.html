<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Jen!&quot; Kyle yelled, running up to Jennifer who was on her way to meet Harry and go home. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Jenny asked, though she continued her hurried stride.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a huge favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled, &quot;Sure. What can I do to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to transform a girl for me...you know with your angelic powers&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny raised a brow in surprise, &quot;Why can&#39;t you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I limited the power of the curse, remember?&quot; he answered, giving her a pointed look. &quot;I can&#39;t change anyone drastically&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Bur wouldn&#39;t it be immoral?<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Jen, its Carrie Peterson, you know...the depressed orphan girl who just got back from rehab for the third time this year. As she is, she&#39;s a lost cause.&quot; he gave her a sad look, so she turned away. Since they were friends now, Jenny knew all about Carrie Fisher and Kyle&#39;s crush on her. They&#39;d dated for a while before Carrie had cheated on him with one of her no good drug dealer friends. Her betrayal was still evident in his pained voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still love her?&quot; Jenny knew her actions were warranted if done for the greater good. This was one of those situations. If she didn&#39;t intervene, Carrie&#39;s days would be numbered. She should at least try to make a difference.<br />
<br />
Kyle nodded wildly. &quot;With all my heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny acquiesced, &quot;Okay, but Carrie remains, essentially, who she is. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny snapped her fingers, and Carrie appeared, confused an disoriented. Looking confusedly at the two, she became increasingly distraught. &quot;Kyle? How did I get here?! One minute I&#39;m--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sssshh, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m here for you honey?&quot; Kyle consoled gently while Jenny muted the young girl&#39;s  screams and stilled her trembling body. <br />
<br />
&quot;So first things first, lets make her hair its natural black again...make it long and healthy.&quot; Carrie&#39;s hair darkened from an unhealthy bleach to bluish black, reaching the small of her back. <br />
<br />
Kyle added, &quot;Give her the build and talent of an amazing ballerina. That&#39;s always been her dream.&quot; Carrie became a few inches shorter and became thinner, her body growing lithe muscle. &quot;But make her breasts DDs, an attribute that won&#39;t hinder her career in dancing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Carrie&#39;s breasts grew, Kyle continued, &quot;Give her skin a healthy tan and get rid of any diseases or addictions she has. Once that&#39;s done, I want her to have no memory of her past. She will remember having a good relationship with her loving parents and will divide her time between school, ballet and me--though I will be her priority. She will be completely in love with me and be wildly attracted to me. Our sex lives will be great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny got it done, but became a bit anxious. Her master  was waiting for her... &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle thought for a few seconds, &quot; The world will accept her changes without question. Carrie will be a spitfire in public, but docile and sweet to me. My opinion will always matter most.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled, thinking of her soul mate, and made everything Kyle wished true. Seconds later, a youthful Carrie was dressed in a leotard, her strong legs wrapped around Kyle. The two were making out against the lockers, her dark hair fluttering around them. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you so much, babe.&quot; Jenny heard Carrie gasp into Kyle&#39;s ear. Ah, young romance, Jenny thought to herself, the thin geek and the busty dancer to entranced in each other to notice her walking away.<br />
<br />
Feeling a bit frisky herself,  she made it to a waiting  Harry outside  and kissed him passionately. Pressing her close to him, Harry placed a big paw around her neck and said goodbye to their friends. They walked home together, the two joking and conversing. <br />
<br />
But when he was sure they were alone, Harry reached under Jenny&#39;s tank top and removed her bra with a single pull. Now bare under a layer of thin cotton, he pulled and played with her piercings, shielding her under his leather jacket. By the time they got home, Jenny&#39;s 5&#39;3 body was wrapped around his torso, shaking in immense desire, his hands still teasing her nipples. <br />
<br />
&quot;Its seems mom&#39;s not home yet.&quot; he rumbled. Jenny could only mumble incoherently in response. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that means we should get some homework done.&quot;<br />
  <br />
Jenny&#39;s eyes flew open. What??<br />
<br />
&quot;But ma-master...&quot; Jenny squeezed her legs together, her pussy was on fire. She felt her core throb uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you questioning me pet?&quot; he challenged. Feeling her angelic self submissively bow to him, Jenny sheepishly shook her head and got off Harry, only to feel her legs quake and fail her. <br />
<br />
Before she could hit the ground, Jenny was wrapped in Harry&#39;s strong arms. Cradling her to his chest, he walked upstairs and laid her on his--no their--bed. &quot;I was only teasing, love. I&#39;ve waited all day to feel you, I&#39;m not going to delay fucking what&#39;s mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling in relief, Jenny welcomed Harrys large member for the second time that day. When he was in her completely, she came. Her brother held on to her silky soft hair and began to suckle her breasts. With the other hand, he admired their jiggling motion and began to tug on the ring of her left nipple once more. After she climaxed again, Harry placed both lean legs over her shoulder and fucker he harder. Deciding he&#39;d want her bare for their lovemaking sessions later that night, Harry had all hair below her neck gone, and continued his ministrations. He didn&#39;t need to understand how he could change Jenny, as long as it meant he had his greatest treasure truly under his control.<br />
By the time he&#39;d come, the two got into the bathrub together, Jenny once again seated on his pulsing erection, held a stack of cards in her hands, each one covered in science terms and definitions.<br />
&quot;Define evolution.&quot; she asked, squirming the longer it took Harry to give her an adequate response. Every word he couldn&#39;t get meant less orgasms for her tomorrow morning, so she was determined to make sure he was ready for tomorrow&#39;s quiz. <br />
&quot;Change in gene pool over time?&quot; he said, unsure. Jenny nodded wildly and lifted her heads up, slamming herself harshly on his lap. When both were done moaning, they continued his studying. <br />
&quot;Is mom coming home on time tonight?&quot; Harry asked. Jenny shook her head, &quot;No, master. And Martha&#39;s gone for the day as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know what that means?&quot; harry said, lifting her up and down his hardness.<br />
&quot;No-no, master.&quot; Jenny gasped. She was in another realm, her heart praying God and Kyle in thanks for this fate. If she hadn&#39;t answered the phone yesterday, she wouldn&#39;t of known what happiness with her master was. <br />
Harry, sensing her euphoria, chuckled darkly and leaned over to kiss the top side of her heavy breasts. &quot;It means I get to take you out for dinner tonight.&quot; </p>
