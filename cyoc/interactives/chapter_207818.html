<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Big thanks to rawr7 for writing the transformation in this chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam has an evil look in his eye. Far more sinister than what I&#39;m used to, as he crosses his arms and has a toothy smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boss, we should sell him to another monster. Can make some new friends before the big event begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the other jocks gives him a dirty look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just want to get in their pants.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who doesn&#39;t? But this&#39;d also be a way to make the hunts more interesting!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mugrel seems intrigued, claw scratching his chin. Eyes looking down to the captive human. Brows scrunching as he ponders on his packmates words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea, pup. Very good idea. Though who’s to say we remain friends, hmm? We could give a tribe of orcs, giants, or anything else this boy as a peace offering. Then when the time is right... expand the pack a bit further. The other races do look much better with a fresh coating of fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other wolves cackle and nod at their alpha&#39;s devious plan. Mugrel looking to one of the thinner wolves, barking another order as Martin is brought to the back benches and held still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Liam, get a bracelet. We need to get this redneck ready for his new family.&quot;<br />
&quot;Course boss!&quot;<br />
<br />
The werewolf shifts into his human form. Walking to the back door of the gym which leads outdoors. He has to be heading to the storage room... maybe I can get there first. An idea pops into my head, if these bracelets are the cause of everything, then maybe I&#39;m able to resist them because mine was damaged. I look at the cracks running through the metal while fighting off that continuous numbing sensation being produced from the device. If I could get to their stack first, I could damage them and maybe it would help.<br />
<br />
I took the side door outside and ran straight into the metal shack the school uses for storage. I haven&#39;t been here for ages, and it&#39;s a lot different than I remember. The equipment has been shoved to the side to make room for soft mats and bedding. A lot of it is stained with whiteish spots, and smells of a mix between the locker room and a wild dog. Body spray and an animal&#39;s odour, not a very pleasant combination, but one I have to deal with for the moment. <br />
<br />
Ignoring everything I put my entire focus into finding the bracelets. Bumping into a leather bag near the front door, the gleam of metal visible through the opening. I flip over the top and see countless bracelets inside. They all have writing across them, &#39;Warrior&#39; &#39;Guard&#39; &#39;Drunkard&#39;. Are these pre-set data from the game? I have no clue what they&#39;ll force onto Martin, or if they&#39;ll even pick whichever one I damage. I read a bit further, seeing one labelled &#39;farmer&#39;, and deciding that might be the best bet. Hitting it against the shelf a few times, several light cracks appearing across the bracelet, as I place it back on the top of the stack and leave the shack. Hiding in a bush just outside the front as I hear Liam approach. The metal door slamming against the storage rooms walls as he shoves it opened and starts digging through the bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, hah. Farmer. Yeah, that&#39;ll be fun, let&#39;s see what sorta disappointment he&#39;ll be when he&#39;s older.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Martin was in the gym, surrounded by werewolves. <br />
<br />
He needed to be brave otherwise they might stumble on his friend, who was his only hope. Martin watched his teacher-who he guessed was the Alpha-start giving his jock pack orders. The air smelled of musk and cum and honestly it was a bit of a turn-on, Martin’s cock going hard in his shorts.<br />
<br />
“Ya know, I heard that if you take out the Alpha werewolf, the curse on the others breaks!” Martin said loudly, hoping his new friend would hear.<br />
<br />
“Shaddup!” Mugrel-Coach Sullivan-raised a hand to slap him across the face. He hesitated and lowered his voice. “Where’d ya hear that, country boy?”<br />
<br />
“I read about it. Every werewolf story and vampire story has it as a theme. The curse starts with one person-usually an innocent, it’s Gothic horror, after all-then they pass it on to others. That’s why it’s all tragic, cause it’s usually a nice person who gets corrupted. I’m guessin’ they ain’t gonna feel too bad shoving a silver blade into your heart.” Martin smirked.<br />
<br />
“You don’t know shit!” Mugrel snapped. “Too much brains on you for a hick. Liam! Hurry your ass up!”<br />
<br />
“Comin’ boss!” Liam’s voice echoed from the equipment room. He ran out, shifting into lupine form and holding up a bracelet in his clawed paw. “Boss, here you go!”<br />
<br />
“Good work pup.” Mugrel smiled, patting the jock on his head.<br />
<br />
The werewolf panted under Coach Sullivan’s attentions happily. Coach sullivan inspected the band, reading the label. He chuckled and shot a look of pure malice at Martin. Martin didn’t like that look one bit. He started to struggle, trying to keep himself away from the band for as long as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-whats that! Ya ain&#39;t gonna put it on me! Said I&#39;d go and be quiet, I promise!&quot; Martin struggled, eyes locked on the bracelet.<br />
<br />
“It’s just a bracelet, Martin. We’re all wearing one.” Mugrel chuckled sadistically.<br />
<br />
“I don’t wanna change! Don’t put it on me!” Martin gasped, the claws on his tightening.<br />
<br />
“So you do know what’s going to happen to you, then? Good.” Coach Sullivan popped the bracelet open with a press of his paws. He bent down and  whispered softly in Martin’s ear. “Cause I can’t have you talking about killing the Alpha. If it’s any consolation, you weren&#39;t wrong. Goodbye, kid.”<br />
<br />
Mugrel snapped the bracelet shut over Martin’s arm. It was oversized for him, like it belonged on someone much bigger. It refit itself, tightening into place like one of those blood pressure testers and Martin winced. He looked around and noticed the pack watching him intently. Mugrel gestured for the wolves to let him go.<br />
<br />
As soon as the claws holding him tight let him go, Martin got to his feet to run. A full-bodied tingling enveloped him, emanating from the bracelet. Martin panted in horror, knowing he didn’t have much time. He needed to get to shop class and use the angle grinder-!<br />
<br />
His foot hit the ground sooner than he expected and he stumbled, almost twisting an ankle, his legs growing longer. He caught his fall on longer arms and wider hands and slid across the waxed wooded floor on his belly. Martin’s limbs hurt as bone creaked and extended. He rolled over and planted a aching hand on the ground and wobbled to his feet. <br />
<br />
He groaned as growing pains rolled like a wave through his limbs and chest. Martin was fairly tall for his age, and fairly beefy thanks to his work on the farm. But his built body was starting to look lanky as it extended forward, gaining even more height. His final few years of growth being accelerated in this last moment. He struggled with clothes that barely fit him, trying to unbutton them and shuck them off.<br />
<br />
The wolves chuckled at his predicament and Martin glared at them. <br />
<br />
There was a heaving pulse from his testicles as they enlarged, and suddenly it felt like his skin was pleasantly set aflame as testosterone coursed through his system. He grunted and scratched his chest as thick brown hairs popped up from the top of his too-tight collar. More hairs were sprouting along his arms and legs, even some curling on his knuckles. His scratching went to his chin as the light scruff suddenly burst with growth, lengthening into a short beard. The tingling reached his head and the young man scratched at his scalp. His shaggy head began to grow thin, locks falling free as a bald spot emerged in the back of his head. <br />
<br />
The farmboy stared at the discarded hairs in shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
“Y-yer makin’ me older! Stop, I ain’t wantin’ ta be older!” Martin said, voice warping into a deep bass, mature and gruff.<br />
<br />
The wolves laughed and slapped eachother on the backs.<br />
<br />
“Oh, but Martin, you <I>are</I> older. You’re a dumb, fat old farmer who fell into our hands.” Mugrel ginned toothily.<br />
<br />
“I-I ain’t…”<br />
<br />
The bracelet tightened further. Martin suddenly felt full and bloated as his smooth belly began to swell. His tight clothes shifted and changed to big, billowing overalls, far too large to fit his form…for now. Years of eating and drinking filled his mind, warm, comfortable thoughts. His gut swelled larger and larger, forcing Martin to lean back as it covered his groin. His cock itself was soon buried in the burgeoning fatpad, swallowed up, never to be seen again. Two hairy moobs wobbled into existence, popping out the sides of his overalls, far two large and pillowy to be contained. <br />
<br />
The denim on his rear was stretched tight as his ass jiggled and widened into two enormous globes that counterbalanced the huge round belly that hung far out in front of him. His arms grew flabby, fat flowing into them, and his legs and thighs thickened into massive pillars, muscular enough to bear his weight. There was at least some muscle to him, though sweat dripped down his balding brow. He wanted to be upset, but he felt..comfortable, the pressure on his cock…exciting, the flab feeling oddly sensual. He grabbed a lovehandle and jiggled it, feeling his body ripple and wave in response.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying yourself?” Mugrel sneered.<br />
<br />
Martin’s face went beat red.<br />
<br />
He felt the tingles reach his head and tightly shut his eyes, trying to hold onto his mind. His cheeks puffed out and wobbled into thick jowls that drooped onto his second chin. Wrinkles appeared on his brow and laugh lines appeared around his eyes and mouth. More hair fell from his scalp, rendering him completely bald. A heavy farmer’s tan quickly pigmented the pale skin of his scalp. His beard itched and grew into a wild mane that extended down onto his gut, gray hairs streaking it. <br />
<br />
Where there was once a thin student, there was now a fat, middle-aged farmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more of that, Martin. You&#39;re a fat, dumb, farmer. You plough the fields in the day, then your husband’s ass at night. Too bad he became a monster, and now you&#39;re on your way to becoming one as well.&quot; Mugrel smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-that ain&#39;t true. I ain&#39;t married am... am I married?&quot;<br />
<br />
Memories were filling his mind, pushing out the old ones. Of living happily with his husband-another large bear of a man-and tending to crops and livestock. So similar to his own life here in reality, it was easy for his mind to slip into it. They were having trouble with wolves attacking their sheep and they’d hire newbie adventurers to take care of them. Then one day, after fucking his handsome husband with his big cock-Martin groaned lewdly as his groin swelled in his overalls-there was a noise from his barn. His husband had gone to investigate and then…darkness.<br />
<br />
None of that was real, but it…it was…he was…<br />
<br />
“It’s getting’ mighty hard ta think. So hard ta think…” Martin groaned, voice becoming simpler, eyes dulling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to think, Martin. We&#39;re going to take you to someone that can help.&quot; Mugrel said, nodding in understanding.<br />
<br />
The werewolf walked up to the old farmer and cupped his head in his hands. He looked deep into Martin’s dulling eyes and forced his will on him. Couldn’t have any of those brainy boy thoughts left, far too dangerous. With his beautiful green eyes and big beard, Martin made for a very handsome bear, Mugrel realized. Though poor old Martin wasn’t in the frame of mind to appreciate that..yet. <br />
<br />
“You’re very handsome old bear, you know.” Mugrel whispered and kissed the old farmer.<br />
<br />
<i>This young stud thinks I’m handsome!</I> Martin thought and quickly found himself relaxing into the kiss. He felt Mugrel gently squeeze his hard cock, slide a hand over his round rump, giving it a pinch. He moaned, staring up into the werewolf’s glowing yellow eyes. His face went slack as he lost himself in the warm glow.<br />
<br />
“You have very pretty green eyes….” Mugrel growled softly, groping the old man. “You’re going to make your new people very happy.”<br />
<br />
“Happy…” Martin muttered, dazed.<br />
<br />
The man’s eyes glazed over. He felt the firm strokes on his cock through his overalls and the hand rubbing his wide caboose and it was all so lovely. His mind relaxed, letting go of the silly childish thoughts he was having, something about werewolves, and just enjoyed the comforting strokes of the young man in front of him. With a grunt, he came, warm cum flooding his sloppy gunt and trickling down his inner thigh. The air filled with the smell of semen.<br />
<br />
Mugrel smiled and stepped back. The spreading stain on the old farmer’s overalls was all the confirmation he needed that the meddling kid was gone. At this point, all the other jocks had reverted to human form and were holding the fat old farmer up. The Alpha stroked his beard in thought.<br />
<br />
“Alright boys, take him to...&quot;</p>
