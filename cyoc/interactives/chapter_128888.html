<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Along with the physical changing done to Robert making him the perfect essence of a Greek satyr, his mindset saw changes he never expected. His suggested changing of his name from the formal name of Robert to a simplified Bobby he after becoming a satyr ceased to feel offended. Second, was his changed attitude about what was socially acceptable morals, as satyr types have no moral thoughts, they tend to go by sensations and brute animalistic instincts. In short, what was human and considerate of others and their feelings, became as sexual driven monster, who with his changed, enhanced, longer as girthy-thicker of his penis was anything but short.<br />
<br />
As Bobby led Jen off to where they could find a spot to get to know each quite carnally, Jen had a few minute to give realistic thoughts about Bobby and what she was warned to expect.<br />
<br />
Jen saw Bobby from his then changed rump and rear, she taking note of how he had to walk using the hind legs of a buck goat for his movement. He walked with long strides, as with each stride he let Jen get a better view of his Kiwi fruit sized scrotum dangling between those furry legs. She watched as Bobby walked how his tail moved, and when he needed to stretch his strides the tail rose up and set bare his then brown colored anus.<br />
<br />
They marched off to that private place and as Bobby needed to work his very different legs, he tended to perspire, as Jen noticed his smell. His body odor was anything but sweet a scent, it was to her as a gastly smell, what made her turn her head to the right to try not of breathing how Bobby stank. He being part to half as a male goat, he did not bother to notice but with his urgency to go to where Jen would let down her guard and they could mate, hois bladder and penis tended to leak short spurts of goat urine to taint his body odor some more.<br />
<br />
Finding a grotto took longer than Jen expected, and Bobby plainly did not care as to time anymore, he being  more as is an animal. He trudged along with Jen in tow, as his lusts built to where he had to stop and masturbate away his pent passions. Each time Bobby masturbated, Jen noticed his fur began growing above his waistline, engulfing his belly all around his navel with shaggy fur. <br />
<br />
The ejaculated semen Bobby did ingest, he lowered his head and mouthing his cock, he sucked on it like it were a popsicle. As happens from satyr semen, it is highly infectious, and has in it such chemical properties to cause his mates to show changes, they becoming similar to satyrs if males, but female humans tend to go full-on transformations and become as doe goats with large black teats on their udder.<br />
<br />
As by the fourth time that Bobby had masturbated and spewed a mighty load, his body fur had spread to cloak him from head to hooves in goat fur. Although the furriness was not what Bobby ever had expected from becoming a satyr, Circe knew better. Her wand was of those in kind what when used and making a person as partially an animal, its planned intent was to curse the body to change fully, and make the human become as was the chosen animal Circe desired they be, and become permanently. <br />
<br />
When Bobby sucked his fourth load of semen down his gullet, then shortly after that he lost his ability to hold hands with Jen.<br />
<br />
Bobby stopped and stood there looking then up at Jen, as he sniffed at her, catching her feminine scent and holding his cock as fully aroused.<br />
<br />
Jen stood there gawking at what had happened to her handsome friend, as he through his own sodomy acts had finished the curse Circe puts on all men she meets. Bobby by then had changed enough to gain the forelegs and cloven hooves of a real born goat. He became a goat in body while what remained of his human intellect began to fight with his animal instincts for control of a body quite more an animal than what he had liked by becoming a satyr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa...haa,&quot; Bobby cried, he bleating then, his face changed, he had a goat&#39;s muzzle and teeth plus a long narrow tongue. He wished had to communicate with Jen, he recalling how much when a satyr he wanted her. He still felt a need for Jen, but from his new brutal feelings, he could not show her love; just his brutal animal style of procreating remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robert, Robert, Bobby dear, your evil acts of sodomy has made of you a common animal, you are a beast, a goat, and one stinking crude buck goat. Circe changed you to act like men do, and animals do, both what you were and what you are I loath now. My wants were from needs to find love and enjoy a full relationship, but you, as now, all you know is male lust and beastly needs, what was any love in you is gone forever.&quot; Jen said, as she decided that Bobby preferred his becoming an animal, acting like a male beast, and he thought of her along those same ideals as if she too were an animals, just like him!</p>
