<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s note: In the future, could we please remember to leave options available for others to continue writing? Particularly if we take the story in a new direction.<br />
<br />
In a high school that had many double-dosed Animalian students, sex was pretty much inevitable. The fact was that most of the students have had sex to get their second dose and most of them have bondmates. So the co-ed locker room had brick corridors lined with shower heads and having special obscuring curtains so couples could release some steam, especially during heats and ruts. However, to avoid teen pregnancy, contraceptive drug dispensers/vending machines were installed at the entrances to the shower corridors so that nobody got knocked up during these shower sessions.<br />
<br />
As more couples used the showers, a new tradition popped up. After their first session, the couple would then write their names on one of the bricks in the shower corridor with a waterproof marker. The markers were stored along with the shampoo and conditioner bottles. Most schools would discourage this kind of vandalism, but considering WSA was a lot more lenient than most, this new tradition was allowed. However, at the end of the school year, the corridor would be sprayed down with acid, leaving the bricks blank again. Though that didn&#39;t mean the couples couldn&#39;t write their names on a brick with the next school year.<br />
<br />
Already, there were quite a few bricks that were being filled up. Unsurprising were two bricks that said &#39;Abigail + Samson&#39; and &#39;Sarah + Travis&#39;. And like the other bricks, there were stories behind them.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Samson worked up a strong sweat from his latest workout session. Large muscles like the one he had built up don&#39;t just stay that way. He had to keep exercising them or they&#39;d lose their tone and size. Not that he was working too hard. While reentering the same event twice in a row was not discourage, it was considered a little unsporting for gold medal winners to compete and prevent other athletes from winning. But working out was relaxing for Samson and it certainly made the farm work easier.<br />
<br />
He was waiting by the showers, checking his watch. Eventually, he smelled a familiar scent, mixed with chlorine. He looked up to see Abby walking over to him, pool water still trickling down her mane and glistening on her bikini. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late,&quot; said Abby, &quot;The pool was more fun than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Improve your speed any?&quot; asked Abby, his shorts getting tight as he looked at Abby&#39;s glistening cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s only so much you can improve when your foot is one solid toe and you&#39;ve got a chest that&#39;s not hydrodynamic,&quot; said Abby, hefting up her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you make up for it on the bike and on your feet,&quot; said Samson, his eyes solidly locked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you could help me flatten my breasts down a bit,&quot; said Abby suggestively.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you intend to do that?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s &#39;flattening&#39; was a bit more forceful than some people would think. Namely it consisted of Samson taking Abby from behind and thrusting hard while Abby was pressed against the wall, her breasts being squished between her body and the bricks. The water pouring over them made things a little slicker, though Samson was keeping Abby pinned in roughly the same spot. Abby gave little grunts as Samson pushed her hard against the wall as he thrust. Eventually, the two whinnied as Samson unleashed a load into his mare.<br />
<br />
Samson pulled out of Abby and said, &quot;So, how do you like the showers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby stood up with a wince and said, &quot;They work fine, but I think we were a little too rough. I think my breasts are bruising.&quot; Her nipples did look a little darker than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, let me make it feel better,&quot; said Samson, kissing one of Abby&#39;s nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; yelped Abby, jumping back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they really are hurt,&quot; said Samson with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re just sore,&quot; said Abby, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine eventually, but I think we better hold off on tit-play until they&#39;re better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; said Samson, &quot;Which brick do you want to sign?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kinda surprised my nipples didn&#39;t leave their own signature,&quot; said Abby. As touch as her equine body was, there were still limits, particularly for the more sensitive areas.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Sarah and Travis have had sex on a fairly regular basis, but this was a new thing for them. Generally, their sex happened on a bed, with them sitting or lying depending on their positions. They&#39;ve never had sex standing up, let alone while in the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, easy,&quot; said Sarah, her paws slipping a bit, &quot;I think you need to hold me more tightly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not giving much room to thrust,&quot; said Travis, a little annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on, let me spread my legs out more,&quot; said Sarah. With a little shift, Travis was able to slide his length in while keeping his balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; said Travis before thrusting again.<br />
<br />
Sarah groaned before saying, &quot;Mary Alice is going to be so jealous. She and Travis won&#39;t have their names on one of these bricks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they get up to a lot in other places,&quot; said Travis as he massaged Sarah&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
Sarah cooed before asking, &quot;You think we&#39;ll ever get her to do a partner swap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would we want to do one?&quot; asked Travis. Like Malice, he saw no point in sharing mates, even with someone he knew very well. He didn&#39;t think that Simon would try to steal Sarah, but that didn&#39;t mean he&#39;d like having that wolf put his dick in his mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just something to spice things up,&quot; said Sarah as she gripped Travis&#39;s broad shoulders, &quot;I&#39;m not saying I want to do it all the time, but it would be interesting to see how the other dog does it. I mean, there&#39;s no one else we trust more, is there?&quot; Using her new leverage, she pushed against Travis, letting herself slide more smoothly.<br />
<br />
Travis grunted and said, &quot;Simon and Mary Alice might not be as easy to convince.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably less than you think,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;Especially after his private show with Camille.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; asked Travis, his thrusting stopped for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Camille didn&#39;t go behind Mary Alice&#39;s back if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;She talked to her before she even gave Simon that gift card. MA was...a little ticked off by the idea at first. But Camille explained that she only wanted to fully show her gratitude for Simon saving her life and career. She respect Simon&#39;s bondmate and didn&#39;t want to get in the way of her relationship. Her little show was a one-time only. The only lasting thing from it was that Simon learned a few new bedroom tricks. And apparently Malice really like what he learned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I wouldn&#39;t have guessed,&quot; said Travis thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
Sarah cleared her throat and said, &quot;As much as I&#39;d like to talk about partner swaps, we&#39;re not finished here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right,&quot; said Travis before thrusting again. This time, he gripped Sarah&#39;s ass with her hands so that he could thrust more effectively. Sarah groaned as Travis&#39;s balls started to slap against her. Upright shower sex was a bit more challenging than Sarah had thought, but it was definitely something she could get used to.</p>
