<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Though coming here isn&#39;t really to plan out becoming a werecow,&quot; Melissa commented as she came around the front of Trevor&#39;s truck, &quot;It is a possibility that is on my mind... but as I said in the library... I really haven&#39;t made a decision on what kind of were to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Trevor said slowly and looked down. He was quiet for a few moments until he felt a hand touch his own and then hold it, squeezing gently, though Trevor knew that Melissa couldn&#39;t hurt him while she was still only a normal. He looked up to see her standing beside him with a warm smile and bright blush on her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one thing I have made my mind up on... is you,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;I can&#39;t explain it... It&#39;s just that this town is so new and so different from ANYTHING I&#39;ve ever encountered. It should be something I&#39;m scared out of my mind of... but I&#39;m not. I met you... and you were so nice... friendly... and in a way have made me feel safe. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s love at first sight or just thankful to have a friend... but regardless whether I become a werecow or if I become some other were-species...  I would like to date you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor couldn&#39;t keep himself from smiling, &quot;I&#39;ve kinda come like you too. I can&#39;t say why exactly... I mean, you are pretty cute...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa watched as Trevor blushed and scratched the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;But at the moment I can&#39;t compete physically with someone&#39;s SMALLEST cup size is a D with my Bs,&quot; Melissa chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well true... but in some ways, that is something that is good in its own way,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;Many weres... and werefoxes in particular can be be very open about things related to sex... Now, all weres have a higher libido than normal humans, but there are times when I think Megumi relishes in being a werefox a bit too much with regard to trying to attract a male werefox&#39;s attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t she fall in love with a different were-species, like a weredog or something like that?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She could... and if it happens and she bonds to one, she&#39;d never let the weredog go or be unhappy, thanks to the bonds that werefoxes form when they find one they want to spend the rest of their life with,&quot; Trevor shrugged, &quot;but while interracial and inter-were-species marriages are tolerated and I&#39;m sure if we went through Moon Lake, we could find those couples... but at the same time many weres due tend to congregate to weres of the same were-species as themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So there are a few werecows already after you, I take it?&quot; Melissa inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;There may be a few... but while they&#39;ve been nice and friendly,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;there was never anything that really felt special... which is something that you&#39;ve provided.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor blushed and looked down again, as if he was trying to hide his embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t say what it is... but something about you just feels special to me,&quot; Trevor finished.<br />
<br />
The next voice made Melissa jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there&#39;s a saying that goes around that there&#39;s just something about Moon Lake,&quot; said an adult female voice which made Melissa jump in surprise, &quot;Oh... I&#39;m sorry dear, I didn&#39;t mean to startle you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa turned to notice that the new arrival was standing by a large metal gate that was by the house. It looked to have a heavy latch and a metal lock, which Melissa guessed meant that the gate and the fence by the house was meant to keep livestock in.  However it was the woman who caught her attention. She stood easily a few inches taller than Trevor was and was more heavily muscled than either Alice or Megumi. Both of them were fairly well toned, but their muscle wasn&#39;t necessarily super noticeable. This woman had more bulk muscle and in that way was built along the lines of a typical farm girl who spent much of her day tossing bales of hay. It wasn&#39;t body-builder size or anything that would maker appear less feminine, but still far more noticeable than Alice or Megumi.<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s hips were wide, much like any female were&#39;s hips were wide, though Melissa noted that her shoulders were wide. They were narrower than Trevor&#39;s, but they were on the wider end than most women Melissa had ever met. Though that wasn&#39;t what caught Melissa&#39;a attention the most. That happened to be very large orbs on her chest. The woman was wearing a pear of overalls over a white tee-shirt, but that couldn&#39;t hide the fact that she had large breasts, larger than any of the other women Melissa had seen at Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Trevor&#39;s mom,&quot; Melissa said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; the woman smiled, &quot;and don&#39;t worry. My back is more than strong enough to handle the weight on my chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Melissa apologized almost immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; the woman spoke, &quot;Moon Lake comes as a bit of a surprise to just about every normal that moves in. Outside of Moon Lake a woman&#39;s average cup size is somewhere between a large B and a small C... within Moon Lake, that means the young lady hasn&#39;t fully matured yet... and to many new families, that&#39;s a surprise that doesn&#39;t register very easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Melissa said slowly as the woman approached.<br />
<br />
The woman held out a hand, which looked cleaner that what Melissa expected on a farm environment, but then she may not have gotten into anything messy so Melissa didn&#39;t say anything. She simply extend her hand and shook the woman&#39;s hand, finding that her grip was quite firm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Melissa... Melissa Jenkins,&quot; Melissa introduced herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erma Tyson, it is nice to meet you,&quot; the woman gave a polite smile, &quot;So you&#39;re the young one that has caught my son&#39;s heart... He treating you right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;he&#39;s been helpful with everything and been a real friend. I had some nervousness that went at coming a to a new school... and that was BEFORE all the weres and so on were factored in... But Trevor&#39;s been nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Erma replied with a smile, &quot;Jacob tending the livestock at the moment but he will be by shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... it might be better that that she talks with you for the moment,&quot; Trevor spoke.<br />
<br />
Erma looked between her son and girl that had caught his eye, and from what she&#39;d overheard at the end was starting in his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had something of an odd dream,&quot; Melissa managed her work up her courage, &quot;and Trevor said you could help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can help,&quot; Erma answered, &quot;but the classes I took in college wouldn&#39;t be enough to really be a good therapist and most of what I did take was with the idea that I could use it to help the farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help the farm?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
Melissa watched as Erma smiled and held up her arms to flex her biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always been a bit of a farm girl,&quot; Erma answered, &quot;My parents had a big ranch out in North Dakota and they worked hard... but my dad always smoked  and got a bad case of emphysema while I was in high school. A family friend, which is a story in and of itself, recommended a doctor who practiced in Seattle for my dad&#39;s treatment. My dad accepted and we ended up moving to Moon Lake so he could be close enough for treatment. Despite the fact that becoming the family were would probably cure his condition its own, my dad refused to be a were and held my mother to him... so I became the family were and fell in love with the werecattle bull that turned me. I didn&#39;t expect that I&#39;d become a Texas Longhorn, as all the cattle my family had raised were Black Angus... but that&#39;s how it goes, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do your...&quot; Melissa began nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad survived the treatment and is still around, though in his state he could never go back into ranching,&quot; Erma answered, &quot;and he did accept my becoming the family were and tries to hide it from me when he spoils Trevor rotten, though he and my mom ultimately settled into a retirement home here in Moon Lake and become something of an old coot,  and no NOT  the bird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good, I suppose,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;but not what I&#39;d need help with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Erma asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see... I am willing to be my family&#39;s were, but I&#39;m not quite sure on which were to be,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;and I had a dream last night that was rather odd...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd how?&quot; Erma wondered.<br />
<br />
Melissa shrugged and scratched at the back of her head, &quot;Well... I was talking to my reflection in a mirror and my reflection showed me what I&#39;d look like as a were. One of them was as a werecow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that is what you want, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that,&quot; Erma told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... and from some talks with Trevor and from what I&#39;ve seen in Trevor&#39;s were from, there&#39;d be some reasons I could see in being a werecow, but as I was saying to saying to Trevor, I&#39;m sure on what were to be, yet,&quot; Melissa explained, &quot;and that&#39;s why the dream was odd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing yourself as a werecow?&quot; Erma raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not that...&quot; Melissa explained, &quot;I&#39;d been reading from the handbook... and well, the werecow they showed didn&#39;t have an udder... unless you&#39;re counting her breasts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Erma nodded, &quot;Yes. In that that&#39;s where weres retain major parts of their human side&#39;s anatomy. If a werecow grows an udder when she changes, werecats and weredogs would have rows of breasts that run from their chest to just above their legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but the dream image of me as a werecow DID have an udder,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;and that left me concerned that if I go down that road... that I wouldn&#39;t be normal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was probably just a dream,&quot; Erma assured her, &quot;your imagination processing all of Moon Lake&#39;s differences from what you knew. Especially when werecattle are rather rare, so that there are fewer stories about werecattle in normal mythology.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the Minotaur,&quot; Melissa said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Erma nodded, &quot;and the lone one in that story was male... so they don&#39;t have stories on female werecattle. Thus, your mind and imagination is more likely to run wild with what you could or might look like. Nothing to really worry about, I&#39;d think.&quot;<br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t differ all that much from what Trevor had said, though strangely, Melissa felt a bit more comfortable after hearing it from Erma.</p>
