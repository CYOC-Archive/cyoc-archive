<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few weeks went by.  Dinner with Brian&#39;s folks had gone off mostly without a hitch- as annoyed as wearing a dress made her, Stacie admitted she&#39;d been very pretty wearing one.  There were a few close calls, with her language, and the fact she acted more like a guy in a girl&#39;s body than a pretty girl wearing a dress, but apparently Brian&#39;s mother had been so happy the mild-mannered guy had a girlfriend, she was willing to overlook the fact that Stacie was a &#39;spirited tomboy&#39;.<br />
<br />
Life was good with Brian, but Stacie found herself wishing for more.  She&#39;d been attracted to girls for a long time, yet had never met a girl she could make a connection with.  It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t like boys, too, but most of them were just shallow idiots who thought with their dicks.  Brian was the one notable exception.  The quiet way he just supported her completely could make her behave in very girlish ways- that annoyed her, but she also secretly loved it.<br />
<br />
The other kids at school joked about how someone had finally tamed Stacie- well, until Stacie heard about it, of course, then she had no problems giving them a fat lip for their trouble.  &#39;Tamed&#39;, huh?  She snorted.  That&#39;ll be the day.<br />
<br />
They were at the library, ostensibly to study, since she had a big test coming up, and Brian was trying to tutor her.  But all she really wanted to do was drag him off into the stacks and have a makeout session with him.<br />
<br />
A chestnut haired tween girl walked up to the both of them.  She wore a pretty dress, and seemed a bit annoyed.  Teri had been chewed out by her girlfriend for not offering to help the couple, even though they seemed happier this way.  As punishment, she&#39;d been regressed to an 10 year old and forced to stay that way until she did it right.<br />
<br />
Not that Teri really minded being younger, but it was a game between the two of them.  If Teri misbehaved, she got &#39;punished&#39;.  Usually the punishment was a lot of fun, but it was all about control.  If she was bad, she had control over her life taken away.  It&#39;s really one of the few ways you can have a relationship with someone who has godlike powers.<br />
<br />
She waved at the two.  &quot;Ok, I&#39;m going to make this quick, since you guys seem happy.  I wish you would tell me what would make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacie didn&#39;t really want to tell anyone this, let alone some little girl who had the nerve to be prettier than she was!  But she couldn&#39;t stop.  &quot;I&#39;m attracted to girls, so I really want a girlfriend.&quot;  Then she did something she rarely did, she burst into tears, unable to bear the stricken look she was sure Bryan had on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacie..&quot; Bryan put an arm around her.  &quot;Don&#39;t cry.  I know.  It doesn&#39;t change how I feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But..but...I should just love you and be happy!  You&#39;re great for me, and you&#39;re a great person.  And I love you...why can&#39;t that be enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh.&quot;  He stroked her hair, soothing her.  &quot;The heart wants what it wants.  You can&#39;t deny who you are.  That&#39;s why I love you- you&#39;re never fake.  You see what you want, and you go after it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That just made her cry more.  &quot;I don&#39;t deserve you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Brian, with uncharacteristic steel in his gaze, looked to the girl.  &quot;You made her say that, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Teri realized that the boy hadn&#39;t obeyed her wish yet.  She felt scared- what did that mean?  What was this look he was giving her?  Could someone really have the will to resist the ring&#39;s power?  &quot;I...uh...I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just...look, even though you guys don&#39;t remember it, I used my powers on you.  You seemed happy, so I let it go, but...I should have offered.  I can fix things, just tell me what I need to do to make you both happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian looked at his tomboy girlfriend and sighed.  &quot;Ok.  Turn me into a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacie whipped her head around to stare at her boyfriend.  &quot;Wait...what..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;  Teri blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It solves our problems.  My life wouldn&#39;t change, really.  I&#39;d still be able to love Stacie.  So what difference does it make?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brian, no, you&#39;re always making sacrifices for me, I won&#39;t let you!&quot;<br />
<br />
He silenced her with a kiss.  &quot;That&#39;s not how this works.  I live to make you happy.  If you feel that&#39;s unfair, then, you&#39;ll have to promise not to argue when there is something I want.  And I want this.  For you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacie, her eyes wet, glared at Teri.  &quot;Well.  You better make him fucking gorgeous, or I&#39;ll break your jaw, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re nine, you&#39;ll go down, you hear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ten!&quot;  Teri sighed, but she conceded, if this is what they wanted, fine.  &quot;I wish Brian was a stunningly beautiful girl- the three of us will remember that he used to be a boy, but the rest of the world will think he&#39;s always been a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s hair grew out, becoming extremely long, falling to his calves.  His facial features became more delicate and feminine.  His waist became slender, and his hips widened.  His body hair receded, and a pair of perfect C cup breasts formed on his chest.  His clothing turned into a white sundress that showed off his...her...new figure perfectly.  As far as anyone was concerned, she&#39;d always been a girl, and she even had new memories reflecting this fact.  And she was gorgeous, even prettier than Teri&#39;s adult form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my.&quot;  She said.  She only gotten a little shorter, so she was still a head taller than Stacie.  She looked down at her girlfriend.  &quot;Do you...like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacie pulled her into a steamy kiss.  &quot;I don&#39;t like you.  I love you, you silly bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Teri nodded.  &quot;Great, then I&#39;ll see you guys at the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on!&quot;  Stacie pinned her with a glare.  &quot;You&#39;re no done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww...what do you want, eternal youth, vast riches, global domination?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  I won&#39;t turn down eternal youth, that would be nice.   But slightly less important, is something I know would make Brian....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brie.&quot; Brian corrected her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brie.  A very happy girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teri sighed.  &quot;Ok, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be able to give Brie children, even though we&#39;re both girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brie gasped.  &quot;Oh...Stacie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I admit, that&#39;s a sweet wish.&quot;  Teri made the wish, and threw in eternal youthfulness as a bonus.  &quot;So am I invited to the wedding, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I might have an opening for a flower girl.&quot;  Stacie grinned.<br />
<br />
Teri&#39;s stomach seemed to sink as she realized her girlfriend would probably hold her to that.  She nodded, and left.<br />
<br />
Then Stacie pulled her girlfriend close.  &quot;Studying can wait.  You.  Me.  Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The slender yet breathtaking beauty just smiled.  &quot;Shall we wander off into the stacks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacie dragged Brie along with a grin on her face.<br />
<br />
