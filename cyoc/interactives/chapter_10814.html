<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After being used so many times the book started to become aware of its surrondings, and aware of itself. It had developed the same taste for mischief it's users had. But it wanted someone new, someone who would be fresh to its powers. It watched Mr. Mendes peek outside his window. The book read his mind. It now knew about Justin, yes, it thought to itself. He'll do. <br />
Justin was marching back up to his house from the curb. He looked around, no one was watching, he readjusted himself in his cargo shorts. He had always felt self-conscious about his tool after that incident with the coach and swim team. He felt himself get hard thinking about what had happened that afternoon. He pushed the thought out of his mind. Why did it get him hard, he thought to himself, shouldn't I be throwing boners over hot girls? He felt strage whenever he was around that freshman now, too. He stepped back into his house and locked the door. He pulled his waistband out a bit and looked down at his huge snake-like cock stuffed into his boxers, &quot;you're more trouble than you're worth&quot; he mumbled. He was on his way to living room to turn on the tv, when he felt another hard on coming, only this one felt odd. It felt like it was pushing inside him. He tried to readjust himself, only to find there was nothing to readjust. He hurridly undid the button and zipper and dropped his shorts and boxers. He stared at the smooth skin below, and the opening that had now replaced his cock. He had a cunt now. He couldn't believe it. He slipped one long bony finger inside himself. He shuddered with the sensation. He left it in there and began moving it around. &quot;OH! oh, oh, oh...&quot; he felt something strage and very sensitive. He spent the rest of the nightr playing with himself. When he finally fell asleep, he still had one finger inside himself. When he woke up he remembered he had to get to Saturday practice at the pool, he gathered up all his equipment and rode his bike to the high school. When he went into the lockers to change he got another good look at himself. He had thought it was some strange dream, but it was real, he lost his monster cock, and now had a pussy. &quot;I can't go out there like this&quot;, he thought to himself, &quot;They'll notice for sure!&quot; <br />
But some of the team had already noticed. A couple of lanky sophomores had stumbled over and were lost in the sight of their star swimmer, with his lean muscles and shaved body, now missing his fire hose he called a dick. Now he had a cunt. One of the braver boys timidly reached out a finger and stroked the lips of varsity swimmer's pussy. &quot;Uhhh&quot; he moaned, he was lost in the pleasure of this JV kid's fingers rubbing him, the other boys took this to mean it was alright. Soon, Justin had many pairs of hands touching him in his new spot. His moans brought the rest of the team inside. The boys who had been touching him now had one hand caresing his insides, and the other touching themselves. They all moved away. Justin was laying down on a bench, legs wide open, fingering himself now. The freshman boys moved forward and pulled off their speedos. An assortment of tiny and undeveloped cocks surronded Justin. The tiny mexican boy, the one who was the first to cum on him, and the one who had recieved his load, was the first to step up. He stood over Justin and eased himself in. Justin's large spidery hands grasped the mexican small firm ass cheeks pulled him deeper into himself. The little mexican boy began incoherently murmuring things in spanish, and quickly shot his load into Justin. The boy was lifted off him and replaced, only this boy had a slightly bigger cock. It went on like this for the entire morning, with each new person having a larger cock. Justin had orgasmed many times in this new body and still lay on the hard bench moaning. When they had finally gotten to the Juniors and Seniors he could really feel them enter. They even hurt sometimes. Finally, it was over, every boy on the swim team was no longer a virgin, if they had been before this morning. The team left, and Justin got up, on two shaky legs. He expected something to happen, some cum to drible out, but he was clean. He got dressed slowly, he was exhausted and sore. He climbed back onto his bike and slowly rode home. This had to be some weird sort of dream, this couldn't be real, he thought to himself the entire bike ride home. When he got home, he promptly collapsed onto the living room sofa and fell asleep. He awoke to a sharp pain from his crotch. He probably rolled over on his huge cock, again. It happens alot. When he looked down to see if he was lying on top of his rod he felt another pain, but this time from around his stomach. He lifted up his shirt, his tight toned stomach seemed alittle rounder than usual. He felt it again, and now he was sure his stomach was protruding. Over the next hour he layed on the couch, transfixed by what his body was doing. He saw his stomach get larger and rounder. He felt a pressure on his blatter. He felt it stop. It had stopped growing. He felt a slight pain, and suddenly, the couch was wet. His water had broke. He felt the first contraction. It was like nothing he had ever felt before. The birth came quickly, within ten agonizing painful minutes he had pushed the baby boy out, as well as the after birth. Justin cleaned off the baby and himself, he also cleaned the couch the best he could. He had wrapped the baby up in a soft blanket. His pecs felt hard and sore, like he had been doing bench presses all day long. He lifted child to his right pec, the baby instinctivly lached on and began sucking. Justin could actually feel the milk coming out of his nipple. During all this, he hadn't even noticed that his cunt had begun to close up. Justin continued to breast feed his son, he sat down on a recliner, and fell asleep around eleven pm, with his son still sucking milk from him. Justin woke up to a heavy weight pressing against him, he looked over at the clock, it was 2:30 in the morning. The weight pressing against him was his son, the boy now looked to be about five years old. His lips were still firmly planted on Justin's nipple, only it had switched sides some time during the night. Justin fell back asleep. Justin opened his eyes, he felt as if he were being pushed off the chair. The clock now said 9:10, He could still feel the lips on his nipple, but he knew that he was all out of milk, the boy was just sucking. But he wasn't just a boy. Justin looked to his side and saw a 15 year old teenage boy sucking him. He looked at his features, he looked like every boy on the swim team! He could pass for a brother for some of them. He looked Latin, Asain, White, all at once. Every nationality that he had let fuck him, was mixed in this boy. The boy opened his eyes and stopped sucking. He stood up. He was tall for his age, he was 5'10, with long lean arms and legs, and well defined chest, back, and torso, and has his father's endowment. Justin looked down at his own crotch. His cock and balls were back! He wouldn't take them for granted again, he thought to himself. His son wandered around the house, he was strikingly beautiful, almost feminine, but still very manly. The boy was very confused, he had the memories of every single one of his fathers, and then there were two voices speaking to him, the boy he had been nursing from, and voice inside his head, a voice that said come find me, I'm in the next house...</p>
