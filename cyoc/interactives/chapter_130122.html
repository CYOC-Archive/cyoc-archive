<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle&#39;s eyes went wide and he took a step back as Jen stood up straight and looked down at herself. Whether she realized it or not, she&#39;d just activated the curse in her possession. <br />
&quot;Er, dare,&quot; he said, but Jen was clearly distracted. <br />
She patted her stomach, which look a little bit bloated. She frowned looked at her legs to see if this time, anything showed up. Still, nothing was there even as she felt sticky juices dripping from her legs to the floor, and yet now she felt a little bloated. As she rubbed her legs together absently, she could have sworn she felt a light sloshing from cum that had made it past her cervix and trapped there.<br />
&quot;God, I need help,&quot; she mutter to herself. She hadn&#39;t even heard Kyle respond to her. Between the feeling of cum running down her legs, the new bloatedness of what felt like a whole gallon of cum inside of her, and the fact that she had just been denied orgasm from a cock that wasn&#39;t even real, she was a little distracted.<br />
&quot;You... Need help? Dare me to help you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha- Yeah.&quot; At this point Jen was so horny she was willing to take anything she could get. She took the pill this morning, so a little real cum mixing in with the juices she already felt was going to be nothing. &quot;You want to head to the bathroom, or...&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kyle laughed. How could she have let him off the hook so easily, with such a vague response? &quot;Are you joking? You&#39;re a dumb slut, I&#39;d never fuck you. But I will help you. Transform or dare?&quot; Kyle said and pulled out his phone to start a timer.<br />
&quot;Fuck you, you&#39;re just mad that you&#39;re a loser, dude. You seriously think I would willingly fuck you? Have you ever looked in a mirror? You&#39;re disgusting,&quot; Jen bluffed. She crossed her arms and started to walk away. She needed to get this wet feeling off her legs again. She waddled awkwardly to avoid chafing until she could get to a bathroom.<br />
&quot;Times up, Jenny. Ready for your help?&quot; Kyle pocketed his phone and smirked. Jen stopped short where she stood. She found that no matter how hard she tried, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to keep walking away from Kyle.<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; she groaned.<br />
&quot;Well, you dared me to help you. Remember? Or are you too stupid for that?&quot; Kyle walked over to Jen and stood in front of her. &quot;Now let&#39;s see, how can we help you?&quot;<br />
&quot;By getting away from me, you freak,&quot; she hissed.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got it. How about we take away that problem of needing to cum? Even though you&#39;ll still be desperately horny from being fucked mercilessly, you won&#39;t be able to cum from it. In fact, you should have both holes filled up with a nice big dick, and still not be able to cum. How does that sound? You&#39;ll now, every time you sit down, also get a cock up your ass. Your ass will be just as sensitive as your slutty little pussy, but you won&#39;t be able to cum from it, no matter how hard you try. And if this is any indicator of how easy you are to work up, I bet you&#39;ll try. Now, the only way you&#39;ll be able to achieve orgasm, is for other people to suck your tits. Your tits will become even more sensitive than your pussy is, and if another person sucks on your nipples, you&#39;ll be able to cum. To better help this, your nipples with grow to be the size of thumbs.&quot;<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Jen tried desperately to turn and walk away from this lunatic, but just couldn&#39;t seem to move. Kyle reached up and cupped her boob, and she couldn&#39;t slap his hand away.<br />
&quot;And lets get these things perked up. For the next part of this, I also want you to lactate, Jenny. Over the course of today, your tits will get bigger and bigger until they&#39;re the size of your head, and become full of milk. You won&#39;t be able to release any of it yourself, though, so you might find yourself a little bit sore if you can&#39;t find someone willing to help you out. But I&#39;m not that cruel. Now, not only will everyone think this is normal, but will enjoy the milk you produce, and want to drink it. However, getting someone to suck it straight from the tap might be a little hard. People might just use their hands and fill something up. And you can&#39;t cum from that. But people can essentially do what they want. Anytime someone touches your tits, you won&#39;t be able to verbally or physically stop them from doing it. And since you&#39;ll enjoy the feeling so much, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too harsh. Just like last time, I don&#39;t want you to remember anything I&#39;ve said. We&#39;ll let this be a fun surprise, okay, Jenny? Now, I think that&#39;s it. How do you feel?&quot;<br />
&quot;I feel... What?&quot; Jen fluttered her lashes. Why was Kyle standing in front of her? And why was he just groping her tits. She brought up her hand to smack his away, but found that she couldn&#39;t do anything more than rest her hand on his. He grinned and squeezed her tit, and brought up his hand to her other one, eliciting a sharp breath from her. He fondled her chest a little bit, rubbing his thumbs over her nipples, which looked to be trying to bust her shirt open. Jen moaned and leaned into his hands. Why did this feel so good? He kept circling his thumbs around her nipples, each time getting another moan or squeak out of her. Her breathing got harder, and she started involuntarily bucking her hips. She rubbed her legs together and she felt herself get even more wet.<br />
Just as she felt like she was ready to cum from his touch, he pulled away, causing her to stumble forward slightly. She let out a pitiful whine, but he just pulled his phone out of his pocket.<br />
&quot;Well, Jen, I&#39;m late for class. Have fun in yours,&quot; he grinned and walked away, leaving Jen standing there, panting.</p>
