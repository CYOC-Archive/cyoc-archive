<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a simple display of candy bars. A grumble in her stomach reminded her of how she had skipped lunch today to make up for going out with her girlfriends last night. In fact that was how she decided to check this place out. One of her oldest friends had come back from college looking magnificent. She looked 20 lbs lighter than she had in highschool, and she must have found one hell of a panties store because her breasts looked at least a few sizes larger and perkier than Emily had remembered. When she asked her friend about it she said something about a CYOC store she had found on a sidestreet in New York, but was pulled away before into any details. The name had rung a bell with Emily because just a week before she had noticed a store with the same name open up in the plaza she passed everyday for classes. Now that the semester was over and alot of her friends were going home or away for vacation, she had decided it would be a perfect time to take a look inside.<br />
<br />
As she walked up to the display stand she saw the mascot of the brand was a little bearded cartoon man in the traditional Jewish cloak and cap pointing to the brand name &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; along with the catch phrase &quot;A taste of the promised land!&quot;. Each of the cellophane wrappers had the same design and mascot along with a crumbling fortress on a sandy background. Emily summoned up her willpower. She didn't need this candy! She had a whole store to poke around in! Now in college she had to work harder to maintain her lithe form. She couldn't just throw caution to the wind and stay thin like she had in highschool. But when she turned to walk away her stomach growled again, louder this time. <br />
<br />
What could 1 candy bar hurt?<br />
<br />
With a quick look around to make sure the woman from the front wasn't around she quickly snatched a bar and unwrapped it as quietly as she could. She took a bite and was instantly in heaven! The outside was the smoothest milk chocolate she had ever tasted and the inside was filled with honeycomb and nearly liquid caramel. Wiping away a strand of caramel from her chin with a wrist, Emily moaned in delight. It didn't take long before the whole bar was gone and her tastebuds were left pining for more. But Emily knew she had to draw the line there. She wasn't about to throw her entire diet away, no matter how good the candy was. She discretely folded up the wrapper and put it back in the display, underneath a few of the other bars hoping not to draw any attention to it.<br />
<br />
With her hunger sated for now she walked down another aisle to see if anything in this store was &quot;magical&quot; like the rumors had insisted, and not just a glorified department store with really really good candy. She rubbed her stomach as her mind drifted back to that glorious milk chocolate. Her hand slipped under her tight fitting top as her bronzed skin rose in goosebumps at the the pleasant memory. Without much thought she adjusted her bra straps as they felt a bit tighter than usual while her other hand drifted up to her smallish breasts, her nipples standing erect against the smooth fabric of her shirt. Wait a minute...<br />
<br />
Emily's eyes shot down to her chest and sure enough, just below her breasts, another pair of mounds were poking out against her shirt! She quickly slid her other hand beneath her shirt and sure enough she could feel skin on skin as she cupped the mounds in her palms. Not only that, but she could feel them growing, filling her hands! Emily took a peak around and darted down the nearest aisle, nearly knocking down a display rack as she tucked herself into a corner. Slowly lifting her shirt she stared wide-eyed in disbelief. Beneath her normal pair of breasts (which were starting to swell over the b-cup bra) was another pair of perky b-cup breasts each topped with a dark aureola and nipple!<br />
<br />
As she tried to wrap her head around this new development, her original breasts were becoming very uncomfortable within the confines of her bra. Her front had also strangely become damp. Wasting no more time she quickly pulled off her shirt, undid the clasps and pulled the support garment away, brushing her lower nipples in the process. She gasped in relief as her bosom bobbed into the cool air. She hefted the larger orbs in her hands, and they felt a bit odd, full almost. With an experimental squeeze she found out why as a thin stream of milk shot out. She was lactating?!? She pulled at her other nipple and sure enough another stream of milk spewed out! And it felt amazing! She leaned with her back against a shelving unit as she began teasing and playing with her nipples, milking her swelling breasts.<br />
<br />
So lost in her groping she had nearly forgotten about her lower pair of breasts until she instinctively slid her hands down to them in pleasure. While ignored they had lost no time in swelling up themselves, at least another cup size bigger and their taut flesh betraying that they were filling up as well. Emily began playing with these nipples in turn, hoping for the same milky pleasure she had received from her top pair but was confused when, instead of warm milk, something thick and gooey came out instead! She lifted a sticky hand and tasted the golden slime covering her fingers. It was honey! Thats when realization came crashing down on her like a ton of bricks. The candy bar... &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;... the magical store... it was real! And now she was lactating both milk and honey!! From 2 pairs of breasts!!!<br />
<br />
This was the last straw for her strained mind as she came crashing to the cold linoleum, warm milk and honey slowly pooling around her unconscious form.</p>
