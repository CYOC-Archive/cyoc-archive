<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt was finding it hard to concentrate. All night that experience just kept running through his head. Never in his life had the handsome muscular jock thought about sticking something into his ass but he was ready for round two. Pushing the hard silicone all the way up into him just felt so good. The sensation was like no other as it seemed to tickle his insides while his mind found nothing but pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it...&quot; he growled at himself as he was starting to get hard again. Even while driving he found it difficult to think about anything else. It took near everything in him to leave the dildo at home. Thoughts would sprinkle into his mind wondering what it would be like to shove it deep inside him again. He shifted his legs against his cock trying to ease the sensation but it only turned him on more. Especially when he thought about his porn stash that was on his computer. <br />
<br />
After the previous incident he went there to try to purge the sensation from his mind. But as he opened up the folder it was filled with all kinds of muscular men bottoming for someone else. So many different pictures of men taking it up the ass while they masturbated with hard cocks in their hands. The second Matt saw them he started mimicking the motion. It just felt so right. His cock was hard. He needed a strong masculine presence on top of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; he shouted in his truck as he nearly burst in his shorts. His dick was right on the edge, throbbing with delight as he thought about the pictures a little bit more. &quot;Stop it. Stop it. Stop it,&quot; he flexed his arms trying to move the blood to other parts of his body. It took a good minute before he could get it to go down, followed by a deep disappointment he couldn&#39;t quite shake. &quot;You can&#39;t do this now,&quot; he reminded himself as he got out of his truck. <br />
<br />
His large 6&#39;2&quot; muscular body easier drew attention as he walked down the sidewalk to the college&#39;s gym. Just like always people would stop and stare at his near perfect muscles stretched tightly in his flexible shirts and move out of the way if they were in front of him. He walked with his shoulders, causing his chest to bounce a bit more than usual. But even with all the women looking at him he couldn&#39;t help but wonder about the guys. Each one could have easily dominated him if they just so much as asked for it. He felt a shudder down as spine as he could feel his dick hardening in his shorts.<br />
<br />
But it was even worse as he entered the locker room to all the football jocks already changing. Their half naked and some fully naked bodies each strong and virile, turn him on all the more. Kyle approached him from behind and gave him a solid slap to the ass. &quot;Sup fucker,&quot; his large linebacker body wrapped around Matt as he pulled him in for a hug.<br />
<br />
Matt was barely able to suppress his moan as he was brought into the smelly armpit in front of him. He still found himself pulling in a strong whiff of the other jock&#39;s more aggressive smell but Kyle didn&#39;t seem to notice. &quot;Not much bitch,&quot; he pushed back trying to regain some sort of dominance. It came off as far weaker than normal but Kyle was still too busy playing around to really notice. &quot;Sup with you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So glad you asked,&quot; Kyle bragged as he leaned his hefty body against the locker. &quot;See I was with this awesome chick last night. Perfect curves. Cute face. Like damn she was total fire and like she was in to all that kinky shit. Stuff I didn&#39;t even know but damn she made me feel fucking better than any girl ever has before. You wouldn&#39;t believe the shit she did for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Matt was starting to get into the idea a bit. Seeing Kyle&#39;s big body naked so many times, it was easy to imagine his large body going down on his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like fuck!&quot; Kyle slammed his hand against the locker bringing Matt back down to earth. &quot;I&#39;m getting hard just thinking about it!&quot; He looked over at Matt seeing he was doing the same. &quot;Shit man. She&#39;s mine,&quot; Kyle laughed. &quot;Gitchyour own if you want one...&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt felt his face flush red and feel on fire as he realized what was going on. &quot;Right,&quot; he stiffened up but lucky for him coach came up and saved him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boys!&quot; Coach Hendrick&#39;s got everyone&#39;s attention. His deep commanding voice easily echoed off the concrete and metal lockers. &quot;Our first game is coming up soon so I need to make sure you&#39;re all paying attention. Anyone having any problems with school or relationships better make it known now! I don&#39;t want it to be Friday before the game and I find out you&#39;re failing a class or that you&#39;re girlfriend is breaking up with you. Got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; the team chanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Coach Hendricks surveyed the crowd landing on Matt. &quot;Matt. Come to my office.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes sir,&quot; Matt followed behind the large masculine man. Kyle made a mocking sound like he was in trouble but Matt just shrugged it off. He knew he wasn&#39;t failing any classes and he&#39;d already lost his girlfriend. What he was more worried about was being alone in the office with the coach. His strong presence in those few short sentences had already turned him on. Even as he walked he could feel his hard dick swaying back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit.&quot; Coach pointed to his seat. &quot;I need help shopping for a present for my son. I heard you like that Japanese cartoon shit. Find something for him that he might like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Hendricks let out a sigh. &quot;Look it&#39;s his 20th birthday soon and I need to get him a present. He likes those dumb fucking cartoons. I don&#39;t fucking get it. Just help me pick something out. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure?&quot; Matt shrugged as he took a seat in the old office chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; Coach pat him on the shoulder with his thick meaty hands. Matt felt his body want to fold in on itself at the sensation. The complement suddenly meant so much more than the condescending way coach usually talked to him. Before Matt knew what he was doing he&#39;d already pulled up the AeAeA website. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... It&#39;s a new shopping site. I ordered something last night and it came right away. It has a 100% satisfaction guarantee to it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really...&quot; Coach smirked at the idea. &quot;Didn&#39;t know sites like that existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I just found out about it too...&quot; Matt found himself only repeating the things about the website that he liked. The sudden gay urges only seemed to be a side effect but he still couldn&#39;t find himself wanting to complain about them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy... Your generation comes up with the craziest shit... Good on ya,&quot; Coach praised again. <br />
<br />
Matt felt his dick throb. He tried to distract himself by  finding a few titles he really liked then got himself out of the situation. &quot;He should like those if he doesn&#39;t have them. But with their guarantee I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll like whatever you get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; Coach smiled. However his eyes seemed to stay on the screen. Matt hovered in the doorway until coach recognized that he hadn&#39;t left yet. &quot;You go on and tell the other coach&#39;s I&#39;ll be out in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...&quot;</p>
