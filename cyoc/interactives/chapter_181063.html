<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on, princess, it&#39;s just you and me...&quot; Jake purred, gently taking Alana&#39;s hand and stroked it with his thumb. His deep, intoning voice drove Alana insane, wanting the building heat within her husband... And yet...<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, just, give me one second, I just-&quot; Alana started, feeling her fears surge. Jake sighed, chuckling before withdrawing his hand. Alana felt a tinge of regret as she mentally cursed herself for not enjoying the passion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I know you just want to calm down. I&#39;m still going to be here.&quot; He noted, and with that, Alana breathed a sigh of relief and scurried into the bathroom with the book clutched into her iron grip. <br />
<br />
After she did so, Jake sighed and fell into the bed, folding his arms behind his head as he mused. He was frustrated, but he understood where his darling wife was coming from. Sure, a book like that with recent memory problems made for a very odd week, but considering how things are in general, it could worry them another time. Little Jake was begging to get let out and he wasn&#39;t going to let him down.<br />
<br />
Alana looked into the mirror in her nightgown and analyzed the woman in front of her. It had, almost, felt like it was wrong: The plush chest that draped sensually, the older but still firm and supple skin, the curls and flat stomach that took years to maintain and diet. As she touched her eyes gently, still warm brown as always, she wondered what could she have been missing. The book came into view, its mysterious designs and intricacies were practically begging for her to look into its contents.<br />
<br />
But Alana was never a reader, and she could have sworn she never had reason to open this book, that it had to have been a present for one of the kids... Yet since she had these memory problems she could not help but feel this book was the key to solving them. Sighing, Alana touched the cover and felt adrenaline course into her veins as she flipped open the book and noted the odd language written within them. As the growing flash of light arose, she thought to herself that no book could have-<br />
<br />
___________<br />
<br />
Jake huffed, his thickened hand had drifted towards Little Jake and with or without his spouse he was going to enjoy at least a little intimate time. Tank top and boxers were tossed off, away from him as he could feel cool sweat drip down his back. His prodigious chest heaved, the muscles in his body bounced and flexed as his other hand immediately caught and tugged on a large nipple much to his pleasure. He could feel himself rising, the tension, the heat-<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun without me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake whipped his head in fear for a moment, before relaxing and smiling as he saw the love of his life drift into the bedroom in their bathrobe. Adam chuckled, closing the door behind him as he undid the robe&#39;s fabric and letting it flitter off his torso. Jake hissed, watching his husband&#39;s toned physique show. Like a forbidden fruit being made to bear in front of all. Adam slithered his way forward, dropping the robe onto the floor as he tugged the skimpy lingerie and crawled onto the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You needed your time, honey, ha-&quot; Jake twisted his nipple. &quot;Needed mine too...&quot; Adam tutted, straddling his husband and felt Jake&#39;s arousal surge at his touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should know better than to hog this all to yourself... Big boy.&quot; Adam smugly sneered, manicured hands clutched Jake&#39;s generous chest and caressed every hair follicle and slope that was in front of him. Jake shivered, &quot;W-What about Mark...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam hummed, bending forward and licking his husband&#39;s nipple to his delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony&#39;s house. You know boys, we always stick together.&quot; He went directly for the second nipple, Jake&#39;s meaty arm floundered and found a grip on his wavy brown hair and massaged it, before grasping tightly as Adam worshipped his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;And- Fuck, the cat?&quot; Jake murmured.<br />
<br />
Adam licked his lips as he pushed himself forward and came face to face with his lover. Jake drunk him in, whereas he was large, bulky, Adam was toned, supple. He was only 27, Jake recently 30, but fuck- Adam was more than he could ever handle. His modelesque cheekbones, the tightened abs, and of course, the perky rear that Jake had a habit of teasing, it was the perfect package that could keep up with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only pussy you should be worried about, is pounding mine to next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could relish his words, Adam felt himself seize as Jake slammed his brawny arms on his waist and sat him on his navel, his cock was throbbing at the new sensation as Adam chuckled. &quot;Did I stroke a nerve?&quot; He purred.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gonna be stroking something, princess, help me with this.&quot; Jake growled. Adam glanced at his husband&#39;s well built physique and sighed contently. &quot;Gosh, you&#39;re so big, Daddy... I don&#39;t know if I can...&quot; Adam moaned, his cock twitched, taunting Jake as the larger man thrusted his hips. Adam grunted, straining to hold on as Jake grabbed his hands to keep him on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, I love you-&quot; Jake groaned, as Adam smiled. &quot;I need you, help me with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask, love.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two indulged in their intimacy, what remains was the larger question:</p>
