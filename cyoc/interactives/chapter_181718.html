<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everyone whent off in different directions, Violet and Catherine headed for the front shutters<br />
<br />
&quot;Were going to look around the block for any nest survivor&#39;s&quot;  said Violet with a small smile. &quot;Momo would you mind watching Misty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to&quot; said Momo as she scooped up the toddler, giving her a hug, Misty nestling into Momos sholder as they went towards the stairs<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you two going?&quot; Asked Sofia as Violet and Catherine left, &quot;well, were going to take a little nap, I think someone is getting sleepy, and I&#39;m dead on my feet&quot; said Momo as she began ascending the stairs &quot;ok then il give you a shout, should something come up&quot; said Sofia, giving her sister a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
As the upstairs door closed behind Momo, Sofias attention was drawn to the remaining four people in the room, Viki and Lucy had began to raid the fridge, both now trying to decide who gets the first pick of the ice cream, and Lina was still sat in the rocking chair, Echo still swaddled cosily in her blanket, nursing away without a care in the world<br />
<br />
&quot;How is she doing?&quot; Asked Sofia as she waddled over and wiped a stray hair from Echos face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, she&#39;s still feeding, so I guess she&#39;s ok&quot; said Lina &quot;now I&#39;m just worried if il be able to keep up with her appetite&quot; she said as her free hand stroked over her belly as one of her babies kicked out lazily at her palm,<br />
<br />
&quot; I love her so much, but what if I simply can&#39;t keep up with her, she looks like she has barely eaten all her life, it&#39;s scared me is all&quot; said Lina, giving a small smile, Sofia returned that smile and patted her shoulder &quot; I know how you feel, whenever I have to feed the kids upstairs I always fear that I won&#39;t have enough milk for them all&quot; she said as she cupped one of her now empty breasts, Lina guessed she must have fed the babies while she was with Echo.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, how many babies are upstairs?&quot; Asked Lina, why had she never asked before?, she had been busy yes but never asking how the babies upstairs were? How had that slipped her mind.<br />
&quot;There are five upstairs, they were meant to go to their new families yesterday, but with the attacks and the police watching the city like a hawk, I think they will be coming with us&quot; said Sofia with a guilty smile &quot; plus, after knowing them for over two years, I don&#39;t know if il be able to give them up&quot; she said before looking down to her belly, cupping her hands underneath it &quot;any of them&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
She then snapped out of her trance &quot;right, I&#39;d better go get everything ready for the new help&quot; said Sofia as she went back into the parts room &quot;ok call me crazy but I don&#39;t remember seeing a train in there&quot; said Lina as she pointed to the door, lina and Lucy looked at eachother then laughed<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s underneath us silly&quot; said Lucy, taking her finger and pointing it at the floor &quot;Ya the old tracks run right below this building and into the city, that&#39;s how we get in to give the families their babies, but it&#39;s to dangerous to do that now&quot; said Viki before adding &quot;it&#39;s a good thing that the security protocol that Sofia installed applies down there as well&quot; she said pointing to all the metal shutters<br />
<br />
Suddenly Echo began to squirm in Linas arms, upon looking down she soon saw why, she was empty, Echo had emptied both of her breasts yet still looked hungry<br />
<br />
&quot;On the plus side at least she&#39;s got some colour back in her cheeks&quot; said Lina before burning her face in her hand<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew I couldn&#39;t keep up, I&#39;m sorry sweetheart&quot; said Lina as she hugged Echo tight, &quot;it&#39;s OK mama, il be fine&quot; said Echo tiredly, Lina smiled, she hadn&#39;t been around more that a day and she was trying her best to downplay things already, Lina started looking around &quot;there has to be something somewhere&quot; she said before Viki started waddling over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pass her here Lina, before you worry yourself to death&quot; said Viki as she scooped up Echo, a confused look coming over her face as she bounced her around once or twice &quot;god she realy is lighter than a feather&quot; she said before guiding Echos head to her breast, Echo not going to pass up free food, eagerly latched on &quot;whoe there pumpkin, you got teeth in that mouth of yours, and I&#39;d like to keep my rubber without any bite marks please&quot; said Viki, almost like a mother lecturing her child, Lina watched as Echo slowed her pace, and Viki gave a small motherly smile &quot;that&#39;s it baby, we can&#39;t have you getting sick, we need to keep all this milk in so you can get big and strong, Yes?&quot; Said Viki, Echo nodding in agreement before resuming her concentration on feeding.<br />
<br />
Viki Then took a seat at the sofa, being careful not to hinder Echo, before smiling at Lina &quot;I guess I&#39;m also her mommy now, sorry to take your lime light there babe&quot; said Viki as she gently hugged Echo closer to her breast<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;m perfectly fine with that, as long as we can keep her safe, loved and fed that&#39;s all I realy care about as her mother&quot; said Lina as she heaved herself out of the rocking chair and waddled over to the couch, taking a seat and placing her hand over Viki&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much&quot; said Lina as she squeezed Vikis hand, Viki sqeezing back before getting a miscevious look on her face &quot;I can think of one way you can repay me, but the children are Listening&quot; she said as she placed a hand over Echos ear, getting a Giggle out of Lina &quot;I might just do that, once it&#39;s bedtime&quot; Whispered Lina in Vikis ear<br />
<br />
Then Echo began to fuss, as Viki looked down she sighed &quot;I don&#39;t believe it she&#39;s done it again, first she empties your breasts and now mine, just how long have you gone without food baby girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mommy Lucy is here to help&quot; said Lucy as she scooped up Echo and held her close allowing her to now feed from her, before looking at both Lina and Viki &quot;oops, lime light&quot; she said, as they all laughed.<br />
<br />
Half an hour had passed, Lucy had a look of pure parental happiness on her face, while Lina and Viki had been placing bets on how much longer Lucy could go on before running dry, it was clear that Lucy had the largest breasts of the trio, but how much milk could she keep in those puppies!?, and for that matter, how in the world had Echos belly not blown up yet, besides on how much she had eaten, it should be physically impossible<br />
<br />
Finally, Echo took her mouth from around Linas second breast with a loud pop, she then looked up at Lucy with a big smile &quot;thank you mommy Lucy&quot; she said sith a big yawn, then she was out like a light.<br />
<br />
Lucy looked up to tell Lina and Viki, but what she saw told her that she better get Echo up to bed ASAP<br />
<br />
Vikis was flushed and panting, one hand trying to hide her erect nipples, and the other trying to cover her pussy beneath her belly, her legs grinding together as she kept eyeing the vibrator that Lucy had left on the side table to her left, then she looked to Lina, hoping if anyone could stay composed it had to be her.<br />
<br />
She was wrong, very wrong, Lina was better at hiding it however, but Lucy could tell that she was on the verge of loosing it, Linas eyes were darting around, her hand also covering her pussy, however every now Nd then her finger would give into temptation and seek a rub or two, her legs bouncing up and down, when Lina saw Lucy looking at her, her blush deepened but for a moment she returned from the edge as she saw that Echo was finally full and asleep, giving Lucy a small &quot;thank you&quot; before Vikis small moaned started to reawaken Linas lust. <br />
<br />
Lucy then got up as fast as she could, being extra careful not to wake Echo, and rushed off up the stairs, tow reasons for this came to mind, the first being she didn&#39;t want Echo to wake up and see her mommies in such a state and the second?<br />
<br />
&quot;Is because I want a bit of the action&quot; said Lucy quietly to herself</p>
