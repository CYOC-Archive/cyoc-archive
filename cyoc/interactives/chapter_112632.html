<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dances lessons continued fairly well, and Kat even helped Martha demonstrate certain steps and moves that worked with various slow couples dances and how they related to types of music. It all worked quite well, though in time, they got to a point where Julie did need to get home. Kat congratulated her on her progress and wished both Eric and the Julie the best of happiness as the two walked to the door and out into the evening air while Martha focused on turning off the CD player.<br />
<br />
&quot;That went well,&quot; Martha commented when she heard the door click, &quot;They look so wonderful together... and both are starting to look better and maybe even more confident from where they started...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha felt two arms wrap around her shoulders and hold her firmly in place. A few quick sniffs confirmed what she expected, there was an aroused weretigress behind her. A lot of these things were rather rapid and were certainly far more rapid than even her initial dates with William had gone. But then, back then, she&#39;d still been suppressing being bisexual and was focused on being ready for a career. Her romance with William included a brief hiccup after they&#39;d first met and went out while Martha got her job at a Minneapolis/St. Paul elementary school and William continued his education to become a college professor.  <br />
<br />
Now, things were different. She had come to accept that she was bi and even loved it. It was the best of both worlds. William as her male werefox had all the things that any woman would find attractive in a male... toned muscle and a large penis between his legs. But the women she&#39;d met in Moon Lake had all the things that made women attractive as well. Generous curves that would respond to the slightest touch, and since the Twists turned her, Martha knew that she them two. It made her happy and she wasn&#39;t going to turn down the chance to enjoy things that let her embrace who she was. That let some anticipation begin to build and Martha began to feel wet between her legs as her own scent took on that of an aroused werecat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Kat purred from behind Martha, &quot;but there is only ONE dance I want to do now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not opposed to that,&quot; Martha purred back, &quot;Let me show you to where that dance is best done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, show me,&quot; Kat smiled and let Martha lead her by the hand.<br />
<br />
The two then made their way back to the stairs and were soon slowly making their way up the stairs and then to bedroom that Martha normally shared with William. Kat followed, catching the scent of Martha&#39;s growing arousal as they moved. They eventually came to the bedroom, and Kat found herself rather impressed. The bed was large and in fact was a full king sized bed and Kat could detect the lingering scents of not just Martha and a male werefox, but the scents of a female weremink, and two more werefoxes, one male and one female. She knew that William had been forcibly turned into a werefox and that he and Martha were now in an open marriage, but she didn&#39;t fully expect to find that someone who&#39;d only recently become a were being so comfortable with things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Kat commented as she began pulling up her shirt, &quot;You seem to caught on quick to a lot things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About weres being more easily aroused than normals?&quot; Martha asked back as she kicked off her shoes and turned to sit on the bed, &quot;well... that is something that I&#39;ve noticed and loved... but most of it is actually the fact that for awhile I&#39;d been repressing who I am... what I am... that I was bi.  Coming to Moon Lake made me begin to realize that and in becoming a werecat... I&#39;ve come to see that repressing that I was bi was the wrong thing, not being bi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha then began to shimmy out of her pants while sitting on the bed and release her inner cat as well. She smiled as the warmth of her fur covering her  returned and the additional arousing factors related to transforming came over her again. It was a feeling that Martha had really come to love and she would never let it go.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I suppose you could say I&#39;ve been making up for lost fun,&quot; Martha smiled through sharpening teeth  as her canines lengthened to form feline fangs on her upper and lower jaws.<br />
<br />
Kat watched as Martha slowly went from human to werecat. Her eyes turned green, her ears moved to the top of her head and became brown furred and triangular. Martha&#39;s toned muscles grew slightly larger and her brown furred breasts swelled slightly, but as Martha disrobed, Kat noticed that underwear Martha was wearing weren&#39;t snapped by her changing body. In that, Kat was a bit jealous. It wasn&#39;t that she preferred to be fully clothed when she was transformed, but as a weretiger, her &quot;fursona&quot; was too large to wear clothes. Her normal clothes would be ripped apart by her growing size when she transformed and trying to create clothing that could shift with her would use a lot of additional fabric that would only make her uncomfortable in her human form. Clothing that was made to fit her fursona would then be too big for her human form. It was that difference in size why Awareness only catered to the smaller were species, though she also doubted that the clothing Martha was wearing was actually from there as she was also pulling down the back of her panties to let her tail grow out behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;See something you like?&quot; Martha purred as she rolled onto the bed and letting her brown tail twitch behind her, &quot;I can assure you there&#39;s more that you haven&#39;t seen yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you want the tiger?&quot; Kat smiled as she slipped out of her panties and prepared to unclasp her bra.<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and licked her lips as she got her first look at Kat&#39;s vagina and her nose was rewarded with the increased scent of feminine arousal. It only served to arouse her more, and she brought one paw down to actually rub at her own vagina through her panties. She knew she was wet and her touch felt good, but for the moment that was only done to wait while Kat then removed her bra and dropped it to the floor. Martha then smiled eagerly as Kat began to transform as well.<br />
<br />
Kat&#39;s transformation was similar to Martha&#39;s, but had its own differences. While Martha&#39;s muscles became more toned when she changed, Kat&#39;s grew in size as her whole body also swelled larger. Martha watched as Kat rose up onto the balls of her feet as they lengthened into a digitigrade stance and grew larger and larger. In no time, Kat was large enough that she dwarfed even Nate or Ben in their werewolf forms. Martha also noted differences that marked the differences between big cats like tigers and house cats. Kat&#39;s eyes became a yellow-green color, but unlike Martha&#39;s feline eyes with the vertical slit pupils, Kat&#39;s pupils remained round. Kat&#39;s ears were also rounded as opposed to Martha&#39;s triangular ears. Martha also noted Kat&#39;s coat. In terms of coloration, she was a pretty standard tigress, with a white underbelly, the sides of her muzzle,  the insides of her ears, and with patches above her eyes. The rest of her was covered in orange fur. Black stripes then covered over her. They framed her cheeks, came down her forehead from under her hair. They ran down her arms and legs so that they pointed downward and wrapped around her torso and tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;My...&quot; Martha purred.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like?&quot; Kat asked, her voice a bit deeper but still feminine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha answered, her eyes focused on the stripes on Kat&#39;s arms and legs, which Kat noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... weretigers aren&#39;t stripped like Tigra,&quot; Kat answered, &quot;like all weres, we can function as both bipeds and quadrupeds. If my stripes were just little dinky triangles that run parallel to the ground, like Tigra&#39;s in the comics and I then tried to hunt... the stripes on my arms and legs wouldn&#39;t function the way a tiger&#39;s stripes are supposed to. That&#39;d mean I&#39;d be noticed and the deer would escape me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Martha answered as her eyes shifted to Kat&#39;s erect nipples as they stuck out through her fur,  and then beckoned Kat to her, &quot;well... you look perfect to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat came forward climbed onto the bed to approach Martha. The bed groaned a little, but it did hold her weight. She quickly got up to Martha and began to pull the werecat&#39;s panties down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And these need to come off,&quot; Kat said as she pulled Martha&#39;s panties off and tossed them toward the dresser. Once that was done, she turned to pulling up Martha&#39;s sports bra with one hand while caressing Martha&#39;s now exposed clit and vagina with the other. Martha actually mewed as Kat caressed her and as her sports bra was pulled up, letting her breasts bounce free.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was waiting for you to do that,&quot; Martha replied and then leaned up to kiss Kat, despite their muzzles not being designed for kissing. As she did so, she cupped one of Kat&#39;s breasts with one hand and reached down between Kat&#39;s legs with her other hand. Kat returned the gesture and soon the two moaning heavily as they began to truly get to know each other better.</p>
