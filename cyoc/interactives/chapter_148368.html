<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lana Werner had been in Italy for almost two weeks now as part of a two month-long study exchange program between her college back in California and a counterpart in Rome. Working on her degree in Archeology, she&#39;d jumped at the opportunity to get out into the field and so it hadn&#39;t been a disappointment. Not many people get a chance to work at ancient Roman sites while still in school. <br />
<br />
But now all Lana was looking forward to was n extended rest in her hotel bed. The last day at the current site had been very rewarding but also long and draining. One very late ride back into the city and she&#39;d gotten back to the hotel well after dark. <br />
<br />
Entering the lobby, her attention was drawn to one of the tv screens that ran constant feeds of foreign news for the international guests the hotel catered to. She blinked a bit, surprised to see that the two women being interviewed were at her college! But as she got closer to hear what they were talking about, any pleasant thoughts Lana had evaporated into nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot; ...the number one problem would be the unruly homosexuals and their perverse ways. Acceptance of that lifestyle is why this school has lost its way...&quot;<br />
<br />
She gritted her teeth in anger at the haughty Japanese woman on the screen. How was such a person being allowed to speak on behalf of her college? And in such a blatantly homophobic manner! She wondered if a call to the LGBT activist group she belonged to knew about this interview. Maybe a call to them was in order.<br />
<br />
Shuddering with lingering rage, Lana turned away from the TV, unaware that she&#39;d just become another victiom of a certain curse. Perhaps it was why she was getting so worked up. Either way, she needed to get up to her room and let off some steam. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright, Signorina?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sudden question in a heavily accented voice got her attention, and she turned to see that the lovely woman who manned the front desk of the hotel had approached. Lana shook her head at the attractive Italian lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything&#39;s alright. I&#39;m fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molto buona, Signorina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lana offered her a smile and began to head towards the elevators. The lady was a cutie for sure, but that thought and its accompanying rush of arousal was the trigger for her soon to begin transformation...<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
Stepping onto the elevator, Lana felt a sudden flash of warmth over her whole body. She wondered if it was lingering anger at the woman on the TV but that feeling seemed oddly distant now. She pressed the button for her floor and the doors slid shut.<br />
<br />
As the car rose, the first signs of her change began at her feet. The thick boots she&#39;d worn to the dig site began to break down, shedding leather and laces as they reformed into a pair of dark red pumps. Her feet were pinched tightly for a moment before they cracked smaller, the skin smoothing out as her toes gained a coating of red polish. <br />
<br />
Her white athletic socks had vanished as the smoothness began moving up her legs. It didn&#39;t erase the tan that working at an outdoor dig site had given, Instead, it seemed to grow more golden than brown. As this wave of changed reached her thighs, her khaki shorts began to flutter down the legs, merging into a single tube in process. The new skirt stopped just above her ankles while a long slit raced back upwards.<br />
<br />
As the changes below her waist caused her posture to straighten out, Lana felt that heat wash over her  again. She reached out to steady herself against the elevator wall, just as the pockets of her former shorts tore away and fell to the floor. There was a crack from her hips as they widened greatly, followed by a rounding of her buttocks. This shift caused her underwear to be pulled between the swelling cheeks as its colors shifted from plain white to black. In the meantime, the khaki material of the developing skirt shifted to luxurious red silk, and golden threads began to trim the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Looking down, the transforming lesbian was briefly confused at the sight of her altered clothing but that feeling faded as her memories began to alter themselves to better fit the woman she was becoming. The first things to disappear from her mind was her knowledge of archeology which was replaced by skills suited for the upbringing of children and managing an enormous household. Next, her native tongue shifted from English to Taiwanese, though she still spoke the former with a definite accent. This was followed by sudden rush of information about her...<br />
<br />
&quot;Husband? But I&#39;m not...&quot;<br />
<br />
The words were suddenly caught in her throat. She couldn&#39;t complete that thought. Meanwhile, her dark blue t-shirt been changing, becoming a white blouse with pearl buttons that tucked itself into the top of her skirt. Underneath, her sports bra had been warped and twisted into a frame of silk and wires suited to support the sudden swell of her bustline from her modest b-cups into full sized c&#39;s. As this happened, the goldening of her tan had continued unabated up and across her upper body. <br />
<br />
As the long sleeves of the new blouse reached her wrists, Lana&#39;s hands began to shrink and pop. Now far more delicate and ill-suited for her previous work in archeoology, an unseen brush swiped red across each of her now two-inch long nails. Her fingers were looped by golden rings, save for one of her right hand. Around that ring finger, a thick band of jade curled into place. <br />
<br />
What was left of Lana was horrified by these changes. She didn&#39;t really understand what was happening to her, and tried to resist the effects. The ping of the elevator gave her a brief moment of joy as it stopped on her floor. But try as she might, her legs refused to respond and step off the elevator. Instead, she felt her hand reach up and push the button for a floor close to the top of the hotel. As the doors closed, she suddenly knew that her room was now on that floor...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
In the suite currently occupied by the former Skyler, there was another shift occurring. His sleeping ex-parents were moved to another room on the same floor, unaware that they&#39;d even had a son. <br />
<br />
The bed they left behind began to crack and warp. Its mattress grew more expansive as its cotton sheets were replaced with ones made of high quality silk. Thick oak, stained almost black with lacquer now supported the king-sized bed.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, numerous suitcases piled up in a corner as their contents filled the closets and dresser drawers with all manner of fine clothing suited for a wealthy couple on a trip to Italy. Expertly tailored suits from that well-known tailor called the Prominent Wolf for the husband and a collection of dresses for the wife.<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
As the elevator rose ever closer to its final destination, Lana was fading faster from her own mind. Her attraction to women was pushed aside by her love for her husband, whose older but still fit body aroused her greatly. She could almost feel his strong arms around her.<br />
<br />
With the mental changes almost complete, her head was being reshaped as well. The golden complexion washed over it, smoothing out the skin and causing her cheeks to raise up high. Her eyes gained heavy epicanthic folds, as their color shifted from brown to green. Her short sandy blonde hair flowed past her shoulders, turning black and gaining a definite sheen. Thin lips plumped up with red lipstick, parting to reveal the perfect smile underneath. <br />
<br />
The long hair began to bind itself into a braid interwoven with ribbons of red and gold silk that wound itself into a expertly maintained bun that added almost four inches to her height now. A single streak of grey hair was visible, going back from her hairline into the bound braid.<br />
<br />
 Instinctively, the almost formed matriarch of the Wong family reached her arms out and into an embroidered jacket of red silk that button itself closed in the front. A purse that may have once been pockets now hung from her left shoulder from a thick golden chain. <br />
<br />
Inside her mind, Lana was being buried by the last memories of Mrs Wong Lanhua settling into their rightful place. These mostly consisted of a long standing rivalry she&#39;d had with a certain pair of twins...<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare does that Priscilla defame my son&#39;s school with her baseless accusations!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping off the elevator, Mrs. Wong confidently strode towards her suite, unaware as the first hints of wrinkles around her eyes were forming.. She was a little flush with anger at the offending interview, but the sight of her strong husband dissipated that mood. She smiled at him, proud to see him hard work even at this late hour of the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Husband, I am home.&quot;<br />
<br />
The patriarch of the Wong family rose from his desk, setting aside his glasses. He took his wife in his arms and kissed her deeply, a band of jade now visible on his ring finger.</p>
