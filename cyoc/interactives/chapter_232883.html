<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From his limited viewpoint on the ground, and being a detached head merged with a fat cock, Ty could only see the big red ass before him and a bit beyond his limbless body.  To the right he could just make out an arm, his left one he found, after wiggling the fingers of his hands.  To the right seemed to be his right leg, although that was harder to tell as he could only make out a muscular thigh from his viewpoint.<br />
<br />
With little choice in the matter, and having to adapt quickly to the seemingly impossible situation, Ty tried what he could.  He found, using his fingers, he was able to very slowly drag his left arm further and further into his filed of view.  After a few moments, his left hand was close enough to touch the shoulder of his torso.  However, this was a problem, as with his body on its stomach, his arm was on the right side of his body.  Sighing, Ty did the only thing he could do and began to roll his torso back and forth until once again his face was buried deep in his bright red butt.  Much to his chagrin, he felt his dickneck begin to swell and he had to resist the urge to lick the tight ass smothering his face.  <br />
<br />
Focusing, he pulled his left arm alongside his body, blind to its movements.  When he was fairly certain the detached part of his arm was lined up with his bare shoulder, he rolled his torso and pushed up on his palm and felt a satisfying pull between the torso and limb as the parts stuck back together once more.  Pushing off the side, and off his head, he found he had much more leverage and control with a limb once more attached.  Pushing his body up on its legless ass, he had moderate success balancing himself, and even managed to pull up his head by a horn and give him a view of the clearing he resided in.  Close by was his right legs, and further was his left leg.  Unfortunately, it seemed his right arm would be the most difficult, as the fey had decided to leave it high up on a branch.  <br />
<br />
Ty, unable to move while holding his head, had to make a tough decision: put his head down and navigate mostly by touch, or try to slide his dick into his upper pussy, a much more advantageous viewpoint, but one that carried a lot of risks, many of which he wasn’t sure he was aware of.  In the end, however, he decided to at least try the latter course.<br />
<br />
Hoisting his head high, he found he could smell the need coming off the purple cunt stuck between his shoulders.  It twitched happily as he lowered his throbbing cock into the hole.  It devoured it greedily as Ty pushed his new ‘neck’ into its sheathe.  He grunted as his cock bottomed out and his heavy balls slapped his back, between his shoulder blades.  The urge to begin fucking himself grew immense, but he was able to suppress it just barely, but the thought of what he would do when he had all his limbs back excited him to no end.<br />
<br />
Scooting along, careful not to jostle his new head combo, he managed to reach his detached right leg.  Ty almost cried out in fear when the limb wouldn’t attach, although he found it was only due to some grass stuck on the detachment point stopping it from fully connecting.  After taking a deep breath and sticking the limb back on, he stood up on one shaky foot, and began to hop towards his other leg.  This was a mistake.<br />
<br />
The up and down jumping acted as a piston for his hungry genitals and by the time Ty had hopped over to his left leg, he felt the unstoppable oncoming wave of ejaculation as his head was violently ejected from his pussy, his body shuddering in orgasm as his head left a cumstreak in the air and landed several feet behind him.  Ty, panting heavily, dickneck twitching obscenely, had to take a moment to calm himself down lest he have his body hop back over to his head and begin the process all over again.  <br />
<br />
Luckily for him, he had landed facing his body and was able to attached his other leg without issue, although the quaking in his legs did not help at all.  With both legs affixed, and without the fear of bouncing his head up and down in his purple pussy, Ty awkwardly walked his three limbed body over to him, careful to avoid the cum on the ground near him.<br />
<br />
Holding his head under his left arm proved better as he wanted to avoid any stimulation possible on his new cock.  Looking up, Ty spotted his arm in the tree.  It wasn’t too high up, but it was just enough that he could not reach or jump up to get it.  However, he was able to grip the branch his right arm was on and pull his arm out a bit.  With a little maneuvering he placed his body beneath the arm, waiting for it to finally fall.<br />
<br />
When it did, it fell in the worst position.  The right arm fell, flailing madly, and when it landed, it fell between Ty’s breasts, fingers firmly lodged in his upper pussy.  It took all of his mental fortitude not to diddle himself right then and there, and as his left arm pulled away the right, snail trails following the fingers, Ty found himself seriously considering letting his inhibitions go right there, but was stopped only by sheer force of will.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the right arm snapped in place and Ty was once again whole, or at least mostly so.  This still left him with a problem, two actually, a very wet and a very erect one.  Ty wasn’t sure how in the hell he was supposed to function like this, let alone fight.  There was no way he could mount his head atop his body, it would end up cumming and be launched away, and holding it meant not using an arm in a battle.  Ty pondered his options, deciding he had to at least start going somewhere, either getting out of the forest, finding someone to fix him, or getting his revenge on the faeires and forcing them to undo their mischief…</p>
