<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul looked out the window of the aeroplane and watched as the plane slowly dropped down onto the tarmac and taxied toward the terminal. A voice announced that it was now safe to disembark and collecting his stuff from the overhead compartment, his only bag he had taken with him when he had moved, he exited the aeroplane, locating for his old friend from his boyhood.<br />
<br />
Spotting both Nathan and his girlfriend, Paul waved at both to get their attention and when he had finally gotten within speaking distance to greet Nathan, he was cut off as Nathan explained, &quot;Do not worry about living conditions. I have it all worked out with the landlord and you are out new flatmate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, Paul replied, &quot;Thanks,&quot; as the three exited out of the terminal, Nathan's girlfriend asking what field of work he was applying for as they left.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Slowly the week passed and Paul got used to the routine of sharing a flat with Nathan and Destiny. He paid a third of the rates; had free use of three of the rooms to do as he pleased; had only to cook a meal for everybody once a week; and on Mondays or Wednesdays, he did his laundry in the laundry room that came attached to the apartment.<br />
<br />
Before he had realised it, three month had passed and the only thing that had become rather tiresome was Destiny's attitude when it was her monthly.<br />
<br />
Letting himself into the flat one evening after a particularly grueling day of work, Paul listened and then smiled as he realised that both of his flatmates were out. Tossing his keys into the bowl on the table next to the door, he dropped his coat on the chair, thinking, &quot;Maybe I'll go out later for something to eat,&quot; as he made his way to the laundry room to collect his clean clothes.<br />
<br />
Opening the drier, he grabbed one of the baskets and pulled from within the machine his undergarments and reaching over to the washing machine, he took out the load and placed that into the drier.<br />
<br />
His laundry half finished, Paul took the basket of clean clothes to the room he had set up as a bedroom and dumping the undergarments on the bed, he turned and left to return to the laundry basket back to its original location.<br />
<br />
Returning to his room, he was just about to start putting away his clothes when something caught his eye. Reaching toward the pile of clothes, he extracted a pair of underwear that clearly belonged to Destiny. Holding the panties up, he wondered how woman could find the undergarments so comfortable when they looked like they barely covered anything.<br />
<br />
Running a hand over the soft cotton, he looked at the hearts printed over the white and wondered if maybe woman thought they appeared cute wearing such things.<br />
<br />
Holding the underwear up in front of his jeans, Paul looked down and thought about how small woman's clothing was and again wondered why a woman would want to wear something so small and low-cut. Holding the garment a bit higher, he looked at the tag, but was disappointed when all he saw was the letter S instead of a number.<br />
<br />
Tossing the underwear aside, Paul began to put away his clothes, his minding wandering every once and a bit to the panties as he attempted to figure out why there would be no size number, but instead a letter.<br />
<br />
Picking up the underwear, he wondered if they felt just as soft in his hands compared to having them pressed against his body.<br />
<br />
Throwing back down on the bed, he thought, &quot;Now that is just crazy,&quot; as he finished putting away the last of his undergarments and then sat down to read a bit of the book he had borrowed from Nathan before heading out for dinner.<br />
<br />
Kicking off his shoes and socks, he stopped reaching for the book when his bare foot rubbed against the soft cotton and shifting into a sitting position, he thought, &quot;I should just return them to the laundry room and let Destiny find them,&quot; but could not bring himself quite to that point of action.<br />
<br />
Instead he found himself standing and after a moment, he picked up the underwear and started for the Destiny and Nathan's shared bedroom. Outside his room, he allowed his fingers to run over the underwear as he thought about what he was about to do and after a minute, made his way towards the bathroom, figuring that this would be a better place then run the risk of being caught with his pants down inside his best mate's room.<br />
<br />
Securing the bathroom door, he looked at the wall to his right, which Destiny had covered in mirror panels, took in his medium, five foot eleven frame and build, the dark blond hair that was almost brown in colour, his flushed skin and blinking a couple times, Paul thought, &quot;This is crazy. What am I even thinking about this for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of turning away and heading for the laundry room as he originally planned, Paul slowly began to undo the front of his jeans and then pull both them and his boxers off.<br />
<br />
After he had kicked them aside, he pulled off his shirt and tossed it aside. Peering back into the mirror, he took in his nearly hairless body and how skinny he looked. Tucking his penis and testicles back, he shifted his stance and announced in a falsetto voice, &quot;I am a beautiful girl. I can act anyway I want and people will naturally accept it because I do not have a penis and testicles and shant ever have one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing a bit, he searched about for the underwear, which had gotten tossed aside with his shirt, Paul forced himself to walk like Destiny did over and squatting down, he picked up the underwear and then returned to his position before the mirror.<br />
<br />
Holding the underwear up in front of his privates, he whispered in the same falsetto voice, &quot;The feminine mystique,&quot; as he once again squatted down and slowly pulled on the panties.<br />
<br />
Adjusting himself so that his penis and testicles did not poke through either of the leg holes, wondering why woman had to wear something so tight, not understanding that it was only tight on him and not Destiny, Paul looked back at the mirror and forming an O shape with his mouth, he whispered, &quot;I'll gladly suck you off, me boyo,&quot; as he traced a hand down his chest.<br />
<br />
Cupping his nonexistent breasts, he whispered, &quot;Do you want to play a bit with these, me boyo,&quot; as he rubbed the nipple.<br />
<br />
With his other hand, he traced it over the front of the underwear. He was just about to pose another erotic inquiry that he assumed only a woman would, when he instead gasped and doubling over, he placed the hand between his legs as a sharp pain stabbed up from his crotch and into his abdomen.<br />
<br />
Gasping again, he shifted and sank to the floor, the pain graduating to a burning sensation as he hugged himself and curled up into a fetal position.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed and slowly the burning sensation receded back to a sharp pain, which in turn slowly faded. Rolling over, Paul looked at the mirror, groaned and forced himself into a sitting position. Still facing the mirror, he thought something looked off and when he looked down, he realised that the underwear he was wearing looked a lot looser in the front and around the leg holes, but still kind of tight around the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
Pushing himself into a standing position, he became dizzy and was forced to sit down. Peering at the mirror, noting that the underwear now felt comfortable and the area between his legs was not pressing against his penis and testicles so tightly, Paul thought, &quot;Enough is enough. I probably did majour damage by pinching my penis and testicles back like that,&quot; and forcing himself to stand, he reached down and slowly began to remove the underwear.<br />
<br />
Spreading his legs, he nearly screamed when it became clear that he no longer had any form of male genitals and sinking back into a sitting position, pushing the panties off completely, he looked at his reflection.<br />
<br />
Seeing clearly the exterior genitals of a woman, he thought, &quot;Just great! How exactly does something like this happen,&quot; as he gently touched the flat skin that used to have his penis and testicles and then, hesitantly, began to trace the outline of what was clearly now his vulva, puzzling over as to why everything from his waist down to his genitals changed and nothing else.</p>
