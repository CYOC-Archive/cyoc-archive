<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the Thanksgiving weekend passed and the coming winter mating season for Molly and I got closer, things moved toward the Christmas holiday season. We'd seen some of that sort of decoration going up even before Thanksgiving. But there wasn't all that much in that direction that Molly and I had. The cabin we lived in didn't have the capability to put up outdoor lights... not without leaving a door partially open, which Molly and I weren't about to do. Even with fur, winter weather could be cold.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that we didn't decorate. What we had wasn't much more then some artificial holly wreaths hung in the windows and an artificial tree that Molly and I had in our living room. It wasn't much, and a part of me felt it paled in comparison to my childhood memories of Christmas, but it had been the best we could do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever thought of getting a real tree?&quot; Molly asked me that Sunday afternoon after Thanksgiving as we were decorating the little tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean go out in the woods and cut down a tree?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the Park Service... or would it be Forest Service guys... either way... they sell licenses to go out and cut down a Christmas tree,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;One of the other Kindergarten teachers does that every year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn't really given it much though really,&quot; I commented, &quot;with my schedule... with what should be my normal schedule, I wouldn't normally have time for cutting down a tree...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's the issue, I'm sure I could take care of it,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;we got saws... and you know I'm more then strong enough to swing an ax.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could only nod to that. Molly had two hunting seasons under her belt and I sensed that she took pride in her successes. The hunting season allowed her to use all the predatory and hunting instincts that were with both of us after our transformations, and in a way that didn't threaten any person or property. And Molly had brought down Mule Deer and White Tailed Deer. Mule Deer bucks ranged between 150 to 300 pounds. White Tail Bucks ranged between 130 to 290 pounds. Molly was fully capable of bringing these animals down and hold them down, which given her weight of 390 pounds of muscle and bone, that should be expected. An ax or a saw were nothing to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus it would give the cabin a nice pine scent,&quot; Molly added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it's a spruce tree?&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it's a spruce tree,&quot; Molly repeated, not letting technicalities get in her way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it is something we could manage,&quot; I commented, &quot;You can take over the watering duties for it, right? Real trees need real water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can,&quot; Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can just picture it...&quot; Molly smiled and approached me, &quot;a bright happy future... the scent of pine or spruce, whichever tree that's been cut down hanging through the cabin. The scent of eight pounds of ham cooking in the ovens, and two mischievous cubs rolling in discarded wrapping paper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where would we be in this future?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd be enjoying it all,&quot; Molly answered and gave me a hug and then nuzzled her muzzle against mine, &quot;and this Christmas... we can start the journey toward that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and nuzzled her back. The detail to which we were planning out when Molly would come into heat was something that I didn't think human couples went through when they started a family. Of course, there were obvious differences between Molly's hormonal patterns as a Tiger-Person and a normal human woman's that would have to be factored in.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
As the days went by, and November changed to December, the focus on the Christmas holiday season became more apparent. More people put out Christmas lights. A couple even decorated trees that they had on their lawns. And a lot of that preparation even made it into the school. Red and green banners hung in the halls, and I found myself having to dodge and duck under them when I left the DARE office to get a drink of water from the water fountain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing you duck and dodge never gets old,&quot; Officer Barnes said with a chuckle when I returned to the office. He had apparently peeked out the door from time to time as the DARE office door had no glass window in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are times, I guess, when being my height is not that great,&quot; I shrugged.<br />
<br />
The humor Officer Barnes got out of things was partially things I had had to deal with since my transformation. And Officer Barnes did understand things regarding my height as a male Tiger-Person. It appeared thought that dodging Christmas decorations was simply a new twist on this, which he couldn't resist chuckling at. And at one time, I might have had the similar urge to chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, things staying quiet?&quot; I asked as I sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Officer Barnes nodded, &quot;maybe everyone is getting the Christmas spirit.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then playfully batted the end of a strand of garland that looked like evergreen branches that was hanging on the front of the desk for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what you're getting your wife for Christmas?&quot; Officer Barnes asked after a moment, &quot;speaking of the Christmas spirit...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment,&quot; I sighed, &quot;the thing we both want the most is to have a family. And we think Molly will be &quot;ready&quot; around Christmas...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Officer Barnes wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mating season,&quot; I sighed, &quot;when Molly will be sexually receptive and it would be possible for us to conceive cubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... a bun in the oven for Christmas,&quot; Officer Barnes replied, &quot;well... I'm sure the two of you deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I replied, &quot;what about you and Officer Jenkins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell when she's ovulating and we haven't talked about having a kid... though to be honest, Megan is more then enough,&quot; Officer Barnes shrugged, &quot;and I've known Megan for quite awhile... even before Officer Jenkins and I... you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've sorta seen Megan as a daughter... even if she isn't biologically mine, you know?&quot; Officer Barnes finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; I nodded, &quot;and from when Molly and I have seen her with you... it's pretty clear the feeling is mutual for her too. She calls you &quot;daddy&quot; after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wasn't really getting at whether or not you would &quot;start&quot; a family over Christmas,&quot; I commented, &quot;I was more curious if you had any other plans. Rings... a nice movie... a good dinner...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean propose to her?&quot; Officer Barnes gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I nodded, &quot;I proposed to Molly last Christmas. Her fingers are too big wear a wedding ring, mind you, but... still, I proposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't Valentine's Day be more appropriate for a wedding proposal?&quot; Officer Barnes wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just about any time is right so long as one has the right delivery and nows the right timing of the proposal,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;You know... not proposing at a funeral or something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes managed a slight shrug and then commented, &quot;I'd never really thought of anything like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could go for it,&quot; I offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could, but I got some things planned already,&quot; Officer Barnes sighed, &quot;the wedding proposal will have to wait for a moment in which I have the money for a ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ha.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And the days proceeded quietly. There were no major incidents at work for and Molly hadn't mentioned any problems at the Elementary School. And things continued along quietly at our cabin. Molly and I were still counting the days until our mating season would begin as our desire for a family of our own grew stronger with each day. And we were rapidly knowing we were getting closer to being ready to start our family. Expectation did that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that had been going on were Emails that Molly sent to Jacki. Some of it was from curiosity over what pregnancy had been like for Jacki. There were questions about cravings, the best sleeping position, and even on things that wouldn't be helpful for Molly when she became pregnant. These questions were more of curious to an almost gossip type nature. Things about how big Jacki's cubs were and if she and Leon had any idea for names. Jacki did respond, with what looked like an amused tone... though Molly and I couldn't truly tell for sure since computers couldn't translate the various tones used when speaking. But Jacki did answer Molly's questions and even promised pictures of them when they arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't that sound great?&quot; Molly asked she turned around in the chair that was set up in front the desk that our computer was on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; I managed, &quot;I think she's being awfully tolerant of the questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tolerant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leon and Jacki are both older then we are, Molly,&quot; I told her, &quot;we could both see it in their noses. Their noses had a speckling of black on them. Ours are still a solid pink... and we live far enough apart that we don't have much interaction with them besides the Emails and so forth. It's not that she dislikes us. I don't think that's the case, but we aren't family and we don't see them very much. So interaction with us isn't super important. If it were, Leon or Jacki would have called us the instant they knew that Jacki was pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think it's great,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; I nodded, &quot;what will be greater is when we have a family of our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Molly smile. She was about to say something when our phone rang, making Molly jump. Holding back the urge to chuckle at Molly being startled, I got up and answered the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; I spoke into the phone while Molly settled back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Officer Wayne,&quot; was Officer Howard's voice on the other end of the line, &quot;full of Christmas cheer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so,&quot; I commented, &quot;We have all the decorations that we can put out up and we've mailed the gifts for my folks and the things we plan to carry down to Molly's Uncle are stashed away for Christmas Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Officer Howard answered with a slight chuckle, &quot;I'm up to my neck in paperwork related to ending out the year and making the reports on the overall effectiveness on my officers, so I'm only making this message over the phone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; I answered, &quot;Is there something you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the moment,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;You'd asked earlier on what the schedule for you and Officer Barnes would be over the school's Christmas Break, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that that is a week away, it is time to reveal that schedule,&quot; Officer Howard continued, &quot;since there is no school for nearly two weeks, it'd be a good idea to have you and Barnes go back on patrol, don't you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; I answered, &quot;we'd certainly earn our paychecks that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear, Officer Wayne, good to hear,&quot; Officer Howard replied with a chuckle, &quot;also, Christmas Day and New Years Day will be &quot;on call&quot; days. You do not need to come in, but we ask that you be on call and should something happen... you can respond.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; I repeated my earlier answer, &quot;Do you know any more about when a permanent DARE officer will be hired?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do the interviews until January 1 with the start of the new budget year,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;though I have received a few applications already. So we'll have to wait and see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; I nodded, &quot;so, I'll see you next week then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that I hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going back on patrol duty?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over Christmas break,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And will this affect our plans for a family?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but not much,&quot; I answered, &quot;We could go on raw meat during the mating season for dinner... and I'm on call for Christmas Day and New Years Day. Which means I might not have to go in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sure we'll still have time?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
I could clearly see the concern on her features. We both wanted a family and it was clear that having a family was something that was what Molly was focused on. I nodded and did the best I could to reassure her that things would be fine. We would have a family.</p>
