<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was having a blast, but was getting more and more curious as to how it felt for Kylie. Sure, Kylie seemed like she was having fun, but he knew that women sometimes lied about these things in order to not upset their partner. And for the life of him, he just couldn&#39;t find the appeal of having a dick inside of him, or why some women liked to put them in their mouths. He also was just a tad bit curious as to how being the one the boobs were attached to felt. He knew he loved them on this end, but wouldn&#39;t they feel even better if they were attached to him? And what did it feel like to have them sucked on? There were just too many intriguing questions that John felt it would be doing himself a disservice if he didn&#39;t take advantage of this great opportunity to find out.<br />
<br />
He was excited now. But he had to make sure it didn&#39;t change Kylie&#39;s mind about them. The best way to do that was to have her automatically accept whatever happens as how it always has been, but that isn&#39;t fun. After thinking for a moment, he decided to make her adapt to his changes, as if she was the one causing them, even though she wouldn&#39;t actually be, or would she? Now that was an interesting idea, thought John as he quickly marked it all down. Throughout this sex session, Kylie would slowly turn him into not an exact copy of herself, but into a similar version, just even hotter. It would appear to anyone like they were cousins or maybe even sisters, but it wouldn&#39;t be considered incest because they would not actually be related. As for why he chose to use Kylie as a model. It was because she quickly became the closest looking girl to his ideal image. There was not much he could improve upon with her, but maybe Kylie could improve upon herself as she changed him? There was only one way to find out.<br />
<br />
He was excited. Kylie was still sucking his cock when the transformation began. The moment it started, she took his cock out of her mouth and sat up, while turning back around to face him. &quot;You know, I wonder if all of this is from something that I am doing?&quot; She began.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; John said playing along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is changing around me, so maybe it is something I am doing? Hey, mind if I try a few things to test it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure. Go ahead, but uhh, does this mean we are not going to have sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see. Maybe it will, maybe it won&#39;t. Depends on of it works or not too. But as I have said, I am still a guy, no matter how much of a sexy man you look to me, I still prefer women over you, but just bairly. They would at least need to be equal or above my own level of hotness for me to even consider them. Now, I am going to start messing around with your body. If you just let whatever happens happen, I promise I will lick, suck, and fuck you so hard you that will be the one who is unable to walk in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
All John manage to do was nod before she quickly began her tests. She started with his dick of all places too. As she poked and pushed it, she noticed that it slowly started to recede. This made her ecstatic. She was right, she could control it to an extent! &quot;I did it! I was right! Oh, but don&#39;t move, just let me play around for a while. I promise to fuck you exactly like I said I would, so no worries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure. Have at it I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Kylie dove head first into having fun changing his body. She already knew what she was going to do to it too. Since John loved her body so much, she would give him it, but maybe with some minor improvements of her own. <br />
<br />
Starting with his dick, she slowly mushed it back inside of him, forming the shape of his new pussy, making sure it matched her own. It felt REALLY good for John too. Having her shape his pussy was already better than having her play with his cock, no question. She leaned over in order to see if anything was a miss, and once she was satisfied, Kylie finished her work on his pussy with a playful lick, as she moved onto his legs. <br />
<br />
John could feel her hands rapidly move all over both of his legs, feeling like it could take a while, John closed his eyes and just felt her change his body.he would have had a mile long erection by now if he still had the means to. But ever since his dick became a pussy, he has felt a kind of &quot;phantom dick&quot; which was kind of frustrating. His clit could only get so errect too, and it was no where near the size of his old member, making for a very awkwardly horny experience. Nonetheless, he was likeing what he was feeling more and more, as a dampness started to form inside his pussy.<br />
<br />
He could feel her fingers moving all over, his now longer, hairless, and feminine legs. Not having leg hair was a new feeling for him and it made him feel slightly cold to his surprise. But that feeling went away once Kylie began to work on his feet, making them smaller and thinner. However she strengthened them on various places that she felt she herself would have liked so that wearing high heels was way more comfortable, even when wearing them for 10+ hours at a time. Satisfied, Kylie moved back up to his ass, flipping him over in the process.<br />
<br />
Joh. Wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, but the moment she grabbed his ass, he felt her hand begin to sink into the expanding flesh as his ass and hips widened significantly. He wasn&#39;t sure how he felt about how when she spanked his now huge ass, not only did it not hurt him a bit, but he became even more turned on because of it. &quot;Oh I could just play with this ass of yours for hours, John!&quot; laughed Kylie. &quot;Its like a perfect stress ball.&quot; She said while slapping his cheek again, enjoying the ripples it made.<br />
<br />
She continued moving upwards, slimming down his waistline while tightening up his extra skin, as she shaved away at his body fat. His now slim waistline would become one of his most sexy features, so she soent quite a whike making sure it was exactly how she wanted it. <br />
<br />
Now satisfied. She sat up and looked over her work so far. From the waist down, was an almost mirror image of her own body. &quot;Damn am I a hot girlfriend or what? Aren&#39;t I John? Wait, don&#39;t answer that, actually forget I said it completely.&quot;<br />
Now slightly embarrassed, Kylie just continues, moving up to his shoulders and back, slimming them down and rounding them a bit more, as she also strengthened his back. Big boobs hurt backs, so she felt that she would help him out and give him a back which could support his own eventual rack easily. However she would save the 3 of them for later. <br />
<br />
Moving down his arms, she shortened them slightly as they lost most of their muscle mass. She made sure that they were even in shape and that the hands were dainty like hers were. She decided to keep the nails shorter though. Once his hands were now identical to hers, save for the shorter nails, she found herself unable to decide on what to do next. His head, or his chest? Face or tits? While she debated in her head over which was to be next, she worked on making his hair match her own, except making it way longer, so that it fell down past even his ass. Kylie always like women with super long hair back before when she was not a girl, so she figured why not make John have such a hairstyle? She had already styled her own hair in the way she knew he liked this morning, so he should return the favor. If he ever found out that her mom actually fuck all to help her, and that everything she said her mom forced her to do for him was actually all her own wants and desires, she would have to admit that she was insanely in love with him since she left the bathroom yesterday. It had taken most of her effort to not bring him inside to fuck him last night. But she was clearly flirting with him this morning, not to mention how her own body acted sometimes of its own will, like when he picked her up, and she snuggled closer to him. So he may already know that I seriously want to spend the rest of our lives together as his wife.<br />
<br />
Having gotten distracted, Kylie was brought back to reality when John asked if his hair was long enough already. Woops, his hair was now nearly doen to his ankles. &quot;Oh well&quot;, she though &quot;nothing a well made ponytail can&#39;t fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flip over again&quot; she requested. John did so, but with a bit more awkward movements as he wasn&#39;t use to his bubble butt and wider hips. Now face up again, Kylie ran her hand down his back, pulling it into a more notable arch. Fibally she began on his tits. She worked his chest, crrating 3 lumps which she slowly built out into what she felt were 3 perfect breasts. In reality, they were 2 sizes larger than her own though, and hers were not lactating like his were. <br />
<br />
Last she worked his face into a near copy of her own, save for now having bright green eyes, most of his features were similar. Some size variations here and there, but ultimatly similar. And to make the final change, she kissed him, pulling his tongue inside of her mouth, and bit it. Biting it was unessecary, but she was having too much fun, to stop herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, John, or maybe I should call you Jill now. Anyways Jill, you are now a women through and through. How does it feel?&quot; Asked Kylie, who was straddling Jill&#39;s body, pinning the former male underneath her. &quot;Amazing!&quot; Was all Jill could say. She would have said more but Kylie began kissing her again, making her forked tongue interweave with Jill&#39;s.</p>
