<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time John came to, the sun was rising over the horizon. &quot;Did I really sleep through the whole night?&quot; John muttered to himself, looking for his phone to see the time. &quot;8:23. I guess I can make myself a quick breakfast to wake myself up a bit before I get back to my new game.&quot; John struggled to get out of his comfy gamer chair that he had inadvertently slept in. There have been times when he just fell asleep while playing his games, mostly because he just got too tired to get to his proper bed. He felt slightly different, slightly more padding in certain areas. But John brushed it off, thinking that he just needed a shower and some food to be right as rain. <br />
He walked past the TV to get to the kitchen and noticed that the TV and Plug n&#39; Play game had turned themselves off in the middle of the night due to inactivates. John knows that he built his character in the game but he doesn&#39;t remember anything after that. Still, after breakfast, he will hop back in his chair and try to play again without fainting like a girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Like a girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; John looked around after hearing a strange, feminine voice. He looked around his home and found nothing out of the ordinary. &quot;Must be my imagination,&quot; John said to himself while making his way back. He brews a cup of coffee and pours out a small bowl of cereal for his trip back to his gaming room. John placed his meal aside and turned on his TV and the Lyfe controller, getting hyped to see more of the game for his enjoyment. <br />
&quot;That&#39;s strange. Bibi looks like me now.&quot; Once the system has booted up and John clicks on his profile of Bibi, on the screen is in fact a model of John. Thinking that this game is bugged, John turns off the game and when behind to unplug the console. When he reached for the plug that connected to the TV, it shocked him. John pulled back from the electricity and stuck his shock finger in his mouth. &quot;Damn loose wire,&quot; John muffled through his stuffed mouth. &quot;I can&#39;t unplug the wire from there, and the TV plug is buried under a pile of other wires and cords for me to unplug as well.&quot; While John was musing on how to remove the device from his TV, the electricity dissipated through his lips. Which has affected them by swelling them up a little.<br />
<br />
John was too deep in thought to notice his change but aware enough to know that his finger was feeling better now. The transformation was a slow and gradual one, with the size and tone of his lips looking more in place on a girl than a guy. But John didn&#39;t worry about that, he was more worried that he now had a brick in his house than a cosmetic change. Once John took his finger out of his swollen mouth, he still didn&#39;t notice his transfiguration. &quot;I&#39;m sure that I can figure this out,&quot; John announced with a slight tilt in his voice like he had been breathing in helium. &quot;I&#39;m sure that I can fix it in due time. Until then, I need breakfast and a shower, this hair looking funky,&quot; John said while holding up his hair, with the ends taking up a different tone of color.<br />
<br />
                                                                                                                     ONE MONTH LATER<br />
<br />
John&#39;s sister, Susan, came over to John&#39;s house to see why he sent her a cryptic text message. &quot;Please come to my house! I have something urgent to show you! Bring girl clothes!&quot; Susan rarely goes over to her older brother&#39;s domain, with him always saying &quot;No girls allowed except for holidays, birthdays, days to get lucky (of which there are none)&quot;. But Susan was surprised when she got to her brother&#39;s place and when he opened the door. At least, she thought the person who opened the door was her brother because no girl would ever be in this place outside of the family. <br />
The person who opens the door looks like a sex cartoon in real life. Her bright, red hair went down to the obvious nubs in her barely fitting sports jersey. Not to mention that the girl&#39;s face behind the mane of hair is very feminine looking, with her lips pushing out in a forever pout that eclipses her lower face. Above the eternal O of her lips are her green eyes which are filled with tears. Susan knows that her brother boasted that he is over 6 feet tall, being 6&#39;2&quot;. But the girl standing in front of her is at eye level to Susan&#39;s boobs, at 5&#39;3&quot; to her 5&#39;8&quot;. Speaking of boobs, the outfit that the person at the door is wearing fails at trying to hide the lumps that are her breasts, making Susan&#39;s own C-cups look flat in comparison. Looking past the mountains, Susan can also see a pair of shorts sticking out past the jersey, struggling to hold back the mass of that ass and showing off her major camel toe to everyone (if they can see past her tits).<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, but is my brother here?&quot; Susan asked the outrageous-sized person with dainty hands and arms. The girl just sobbed out, &quot;I knew you wouldn&#39;t recognize me!&quot; and tried to slam the door. What the short stack did was slam the door in her bigger-than-her-torso-size tits and send her flying toward the ground, tits first. From the back, Susan can see how thin her waist is in comparison to the girl&#39;s assets. She would&#39;ve said that&#39;s because of a corset if she wasn&#39;t looking at her bare back, with no bra or undergarment to be seen on her. &quot;If there was a bra big enough for those things,&quot; Susan jealously thought while looking at the poor girl&#39;s body. It was then that she happened to see a tattoo of John&#39;s tats on the sexual girl&#39;s dangerously thin inner arm, a pin-up girl holding a game controller. <br />
&quot;Where did you get this tattoo?&quot; asked Susan when she got close enough to see the tattoo properly. &quot;I got it at the mall, remember&quot; cried out the girl between sniffles while she rubs her tits on the part where she bang the door on her. &quot;I got Cecilia while you got Peter on your calf.&quot; Susan pulled up her jeans, showing off her own tattoo of her pet dog, Peter. &quot;How did you know? Not even Mom knows about Peter.&quot; &quot;BECAUSE I AM YOUR BROTHER!!<br />
<br />
After a short period of crying into each other shoulders (with the bigger girl being in between the boobs of the smaller girl) on the ground, Susan and the turned-girl John (who goes by Bibi as stated in the ID card) calmed themselves down and tried to figure out how to move forward. &quot;First off, how did you manage to not be in trouble with your class?&quot; Susan pointed out how John managed to hide Bibi. &quot;Before my voice became too much like a girl, I managed to change it to online only.&quot; &quot;Okay, that works. But what about food?&quot; &quot;Online food deliveries. Thank god that I have the ability to type with these skeleton claws,&quot; Bibi holds up her very thin hands.<br />
&quot;How did this happen to you?&quot; wondered the younger sister. &quot;One doesn&#39;t become a woman over a month, let alone a short thick one at that.&quot; Susan pointed out while poking her order &quot;sister&#39; in her right boob by her nipple. &quot;Stop that, they are really sensitive,&quot; cried out Bibi while trying to reach where Susan was poking at.<br />
&quot;I think it was because of the game I got.&quot; &quot;Wait, what? A video game&quot; Bibi slowly got up from the floor and waddled toward her gaming room. &quot;I would&#39;ve tried to fix it myself. But as you can see, I no longer can go through tight spaces,&quot; and Bibi demonstrated by bouncing off the door frame from her wide ass and full tits. &quot;Could you go in and try to help me?&quot; pleaded the smaller girl while giving Susan the puppy dog eyes. &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll help you. Not because of the puppy dog&#39;s eyes, which made you look really adorable.&quot; So Susan went into the gaming room, turned on the machines, and took the Lyfe controller.</p>
