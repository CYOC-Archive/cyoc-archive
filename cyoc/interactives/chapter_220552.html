<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sorceror smiled. &quot;Your youth, my dear&quot; <br />
<br />
Brianne immediately scowled. &quot;So you wish of me to be some withered old crone?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sorceror shook her head. &quot;No, I am fair. You have been alive for 16 years, so I shall take 16 years from you.&quot; The sorceror got closer. &quot;Underneath your soft exterior lies something dormant. There is a ferocity inside of you and it simply needs to be unearthed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I refuse such a generous offer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then Brianne, it becomes quite simple. Your mother dies, your father becomes a bitter recluse, and you spend an unfulfilled life trapped on this isle, never seeing what&#39;s on the other side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianne tried to gather her thoughts. She was highly suspicious of this woman...but what choice did she have? Her mother was going to die and if it was in her power to prevent that from happening, Brianne knew she had to do it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I agree to your terms on one condition witch...I see my mother being cured, and I get to say goodbye to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the sorceror replied. &quot;I will need to prepare first, but we will meet at sun&#39;s set.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
As Brianne watched the sun go down, she tried to manage all the thoughts in her head. Who was this woman, could she actually save her mother, what does losing her &quot;youth&quot; mean. Brianne closed her eyes for a brief second and when she re-opened them, she was in her mother, Queen Mira&#39;s, room with the sorceror. She almost asked how, but thought better of it.<br />
<br />
The sorceror walked up to Mira&#39;s bed. The queen was moaning in pain, as pale as a ghost. The sorceror simply laid the back of her right on Mira&#39;s forehead. The sorceror&#39;s eyes briefly rolled in the back of head. Within seconds, the queen&#39;s skin color returned to a more natural shade and her pain seemed to subsist. &quot;I will leave you for now. Meet me in the fields behind the castle in a half hour, or I will come back for you myself.&quot; With that, the sorceror vanished in a cloud of black smoke.<br />
<br />
Brianne walked up to her mother&#39;s bed. &quot;Mama, it&#39;s me...how are you feeling???&quot;<br />
&quot;Brianne...is that you? I, I feel...wonderful,&quot; her mother cheerily replied. &quot;It seems as if whatever darkness has plagued me has finally lifted.&quot;<br />
Barely holding back tears, Brianne smiled. &quot;That&#39;s so wonderful...I couldn&#39;t have lost you.&quot;<br />
Adjusting herself up in bed, Mira grabbed both of Brianne&#39;s hands and clasped them together. &quot;You and your father never lost faith. That is what kept me alive.&quot; Mira said. &quot;Oh my child, you have been through so much, but you are so, so strong. I see so much ahead for you...but never forget that no matter what, you will always have me by your side, whether in body or spirit.&quot;<br />
Brianne turned away so as not to reveal her tears. &quot;I love you mother.&quot;<br />
&quot;I love you too, Brianne. Now rest up, tomorrow we can tend to the fields on the west side of the isle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianne silently walked out of the room.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Amidst the commotion created by her mother&#39;s recovery, Brianne snuck out of the castle and headed behind the castle. Unsurprisingly, the sorceror was waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how is your mother doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;She looks to be cured. Thank you, whatever it is you did, it worked.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I have put up my end of the bargain. It is your turn, miss Brianne.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianne shook at these words. &quot;How is this going to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sorceror walked over to her and pulled out a small pouch. &quot;You simply stand there and let the magic take it&#39;s course.&quot; The sorceror opened up the pouch and let what appeared to be purple sand pour out into her hand. The sorceror licked her right index finger and placed it on Brianne&#39;s forehead.  &quot;14 years...unspool them from Brianne&#39;s web...let the course of time reveal itself.&quot; she said in almost a faint whisper. Suddenly, she blew the purple sand right into Brianne&#39;s face, causing her to cough controllably.<br />
<br />
Brianne entered a fugue state as purple smoke started to envelop her. She could barely process what was happening to her, but she knew something was. The smoke felt...soft, like a big, warm blanket. She had never felt anything like this in her life. Underneath the smoke, changes were starting to take place. Brianne&#39;s arms, legs, and waist started to expand vertically. She could see her hands getting larger and more delicate like her mother&#39;s. Her feet followed suit. Brianne&#39;s silhouette started to shift as she felt herself getting heavier. Her legs and arms began to take on more flesh. Her hips became more pronounced, and her butt took on girth. She felt slightly confused as the flesh on her arms, waist, and legs tightened somewhat. The most noticeable aspect for Brianne came when her breasts started to grow, leading Brianne to preemptively cover them with her arms. Brianne could not exactly parse what was happening to her, but it felt...good? Brianne&#39;s changes continued as her face began to feel numb. Flesh began retract and as Brianne touched her face, she could feel her cheekbones. Brianne&#39;s nose got smaller and her lips slightly bigger. The next change came as a shock to Brianne as her dark brown hair changed to white as fog. The cloth outfit Brianne was wearing changed too, shifting to a black gown. <br />
<br />
The smoke dissipated. Brianne struggled to her feet, feeling very disoriented. &quot;What have you done to me??&quot; Brianne asked, startled by her new deeper voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my child, this isn&#39;t my work.&quot; the sorceror said. &quot;There was dark magic hidden in your blood line...it took some prying, but I unleashed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark magic?&quot; Brianne muttered as she finally stood up, still overwhelmed by her new body. <br />
&quot;Oh yes, loads of it. You were always told that you would be nothing more than a farmer...there is so much ahead of you.&quot; The sorceror walked up to Brianne and to Brianne&#39;s disgust, licked her face. &quot;You came together quite nicely...I would have you for myself, but that is not a part of the plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianne&#39;s blood boiled. &quot;Don&#39;t...you...TOUCH ME!!!!!!&quot; she screamed as she projected a green gust of energy right at the sorceror. The sorceror knocked to her feet. &quot;My goodness...you have such potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WITCH! There&#39;s a witch on the island!&quot; Brianne could hear the king&#39;s guardsmen shout.<br />
&quot;Brianne, you need to run. If they catch you, they will kill you. Two kilometers east, there&#39;s a boat with rations on the shore. Take it and sail  three days west. You&#39;ll find your purpose there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianne started to run but stopped momentarily. Glaring at the sorceror, Brianne spewed invective. &quot;If I ever see you again, I will kill YOU. I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Brianne ran towards the oar, hoping she had enough stamina before the guardsmen caught her.</p>
