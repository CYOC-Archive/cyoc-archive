<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wished for them to revert back into their normal bodies.  I wondered if they might try to stop me somehow, but I guess they couldn't do that short of biting or scratching me, which my wish wouldn't let them do.  It took a few minutes for their bodies to shift back into human form.  Theresa, being the prude that she was, frantically ran for her scraps of tattered clothing and covered herself as best she could.  Stephen, meanwhile, just sat down on one of the couches.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; I said.  &quot;Was it what you'd imagined?&quot; I asked both of them.<br />
<br />
Stephen spoke first.  &quot;I don't know,&quot; he said.  &quot;I mean...I don't really know how I could have ever truly imagined it.  I will say that it felt totally intense.  It got to the point where I forgot I was a tiger, that I was female.  All I felt was desire and passion and, and...I don't know, it's really hard to put it into words.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theresa didn't seem to want to talk at first.  Finally she relented and said, &quot;I loved it!  I loved having the power.  I mean...I loved having a p...having a pe...having a penis, dammit!&quot;  She looked shocked at the words that she just spoke.  &quot;Oh, hell, I don't care.  I fucking loved it!&quot;  She took the scraps of clothes covering her and just threw them to the ground.  &quot;What's the point?&quot; she laughed.  &quot;I feel so free and liberated now!&quot;  We all looked surprised, but pleased with her awakening.<br />
<br />
I rather enjoyed seeing Theresa feel so liberated.  The level of prudishness she had displayed up to this point didn't really fit with the group of people I assembled so far.  I was hopeful that she would turn a corner.  The next few minutes would tell me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an important question to ask both of you,&quot; I said.  &quot;Would you prefer to be tigers all the time?&quot;<br />
<br />
They were both taken aback by this question.  Either they were surprised I asked it or they'd just never considered it.  They looked at each other as if they each hoped the other would lead the way and make a decision.  But neither of their faces held such wisdom.  Stephen spoke first.  &quot;I...I don't think I would,&quot; he said.  &quot;I...well...I still like having sex with...well, as a male.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theresa didn't look very happy.  &quot;Do you mean you don't want to ever do that again?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, of course not, not at all,&quot; Stephen quickly answered.  &quot;I just don't want to be like that all the time.  I don't think I could get used to it.  Besides...I'd like to know you better as a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theresa blushed in response to this.  I think she was also embarrassed that she assumed too much in what Stephen initially said.  &quot;I want to know you better, too,&quot; she said.  &quot;And I think I would miss being a human, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, that's settled,&quot; I said.  I turned my focus to Stephen.  &quot;Now, Stephen, Theresa knows that I'm bringing together a small group of people for the purpose of forging a new world.  Theresa has already said she wants to be part of it.  I'd like for you to join us as well.&quot;  He looked at me questioningly.  &quot;Let me explain my plan to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
After going into detail about my plan, Stephen seemed receptive.  He summed up his acceptance by saying, &quot;Anything if it means spending more time with Theresa.&quot;  Theresa leaned over and gave him a passionate kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
I let them finish before I picked up again.  &quot;You two are going to be a little special in our group.  I want you to be able to have your fantasy whenever you want.  But in order for me to make that possible, there are a few conditions I must insist upon,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are they?&quot; asked Theresa.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, when in a group setting, you must both address me as 'my goddess,'&quot; I said.  &quot;Everyone else in our group already does this.  Second, you must allow me to alter your names.  Now, if you're concerned about this, let me just say that everyone else in our group has been given an entirely new identity.&quot;  I stopped, cast a quick glance over my shoulder at Bozantum, and then whispered to them, &quot;Even him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that,&quot; he said.  &quot;You know I know that's true anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hush, you,&quot; I chided him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, my goddess,&quot; he said.  I detected just a hint of sarcasm in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also would like to change your appearances just a little bit,&quot; I continued with my conditions.  &quot;Nothing drastic, but just some improvements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I like myself now,&quot; Theresa protested.<br />
<br />
I anticipated that she would.  I didn't want to wish her into accepting, so I tried rationale that suited my position.  &quot;I understand, my dear,&quot; I said.  &quot;But think of it this way.  You already know you have someone who loves you for who you truly are.  Right?&quot; I asked Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; he said.  &quot;Completely and truly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; I said.  &quot;He already loves you for the person you are.  I'm not going to change that.  I just want to enhance your appearance so that you turn heads on the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
I realized I made an inadvertent reference to what happened earlier in the day.  She could very well get angry at this last suggestion.  Instead she surprised me.  &quot;You know what,&quot; she said.  &quot;I think I'd enjoy that.  Especially after today.&quot;  Stephen was going to ask her what she meant, but she stopped him.  &quot;Not really important.  I'll tell you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you both agree to all my conditions?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Theresa stood up and proudly said, &quot;Absolutely, my goddess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephen didn't immediately follow suit.  Theresa looked down at him expectantly.  He shrugged his shoulders and stood up.  &quot;I'm with you,&quot; he said.  Both Theresa and I kept looking at him.  Bozantum shot him a menacing glance as well.  &quot;I'm with you, my goddess,&quot; he corrected himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; I said.  &quot;Let's get started.&quot;</p>
