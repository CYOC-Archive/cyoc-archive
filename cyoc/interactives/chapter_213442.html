<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff awoke to feeling disgusting, he was extra oily, and had to start the day with a shower despite taking one just yesterday. He realized he must have sweat because his bedsheets felt gross, and he threw them in the wash.<br />
<br />
The day started pretty usual for Jeff, he did homework, ate frequently, and the Chronivac made it normal for the house to be filled with food and ready to go meals. Being a teen he was used to not understanding how hungry he&#39;d be at any given minute but his rapid digestion kept his stomach nearly empty and the 5 degree increase in body temperature kept his body happily working on his changes without his metabolism screaming &#39;stop&#39; due to overheating. Having conquered Jeff&#39;s immune system, the infection didn&#39;t need to wait for the boost from the full moon to continue.<br />
<br />
The normal day quickly degraded to insanity however. Throughout Jeff&#39;s body his nervous system followed suit after his cardiovascular system, having a werewolf pass out in front of you is still scary, because it will wake up... having it paralyze its host by severing its connection with the rest of its body... well that&#39;s honestly sad...  but lengthening the connections making it take longer to receive nerve impulses is bad. Reaction time is a thing...<br />
<br />
Like the super effective enzyme slurry in Jeff&#39;s stomach, the disease had its own solution (pun intended). The myelin sheaths covering his nerve cells began to permeate into the nerve cells and track when the nerve activated and to what degree... they began absorbing their own sodium and flooding the nerve when activated. This ultimately sped up activation, but initially left Jeff in a brain fog craving salt like he&#39;s never tasted a more delicious flavor... and twitchy. Unexpected muscle spasms, images, and thoughts began to occur as all the modified nerves had their own, different activation requirements and if the cell had too much sodium from a prior activation, the overeager disease modified system caused some misfires.<br />
<br />
Jeff was relaxing on the couch but was sure he heard a train, another time he smelled perfume, several times he swore someone touched him or said something. For a brief moment he was petting his beloved cat and wanted to grab it a treat, they didn&#39;t own a cat, or any pets for that matter. The sensation faded as quickly as it came but Jeff had to check the pantry to make sure there really weren&#39;t cat treats in there. This type of thing continued to varying degrees throughout the day.<br />
<br />
Jeff almost went to his parent&#39;s for help but despite feeling okay, his throat was swollen and he had laryngitis meaning he&#39;d have to put everything in writing, and instead he convinced himself it will pass. Part of the strange senses had to do with his senses acting strange. His nose was creating millions of olfactory receptors, his eyes were making new rods and cones extending his vision into infrared and ultraviolet, and his ears were becoming sensitive to a much larger array of sounds.<br />
<br />
Jeff was excused from dinner conversation since the first few times he tried to speak only broken squeaks came out. His mother was concerned but Jeff assured her he felt fine. Despite having had roughly 6-7 full meals spread throughout the day he ate a decent sized dinner and that satisfied his mom. Jeff went back to his room after dinner trying to finish his homework.<br />
<br />
As evening fell and the moon rose to its precipice, Jeff&#39;s night grew stranger. Jeff was working on a math problem, not usually an issue but everything looked off, as he wrote things down his hand moved up the page, and he was writing over the question itself. He erased, flipped the pencil over, and dropped the pencil. With an emphatic squeak (laryngitis) he grabbed the pencil realizing it felt smaller, looking at his hand it was growing bigger?<br />
<br />
Not being the first or weirdest experience he had today, he shrugged it off and decided to grab some water. Going to the restroom, he has a small cup used to rinse his mouth out after brushing his teeth which was much closer than the kitchen. He got to the bathroom, filled the glass and chugged several glasses down in second. Jeff felt like his skin was burning up. He pulled off his shirt, then his pants, then he filled a cup with water and splashed it on himself. He was fighting with getting his pants off, about to jump in the shower, and looked at himself in the mirror to verify if he was turning red or something, only to find thick coarse hairs beginning to poke out of his body.<br />
<br />
He screamed, several times, as loudly as he could... which made no sound. Out of fight, flight, or freeze, Jeff froze. He might be dying but there was no clear threat to get rid of, so not really anything to fight or fly from. The horror of the situation compounded as he watched his body grow before his eyes in the mirror. <br />
<br />
He began to peer closer as something happened to his legs and he jutted forward bashing his faces into the mirror, he cried out in pain releasing a string of expletives but his voice didn&#39;t work yet. He braced himself on the countertop and collapsed onto the toilet only to find sitting very awkward, and his knee caps disappeared. He tried pulling at the strange coarse hairs but they were firmly affixed to his skin (being several multiples the size of a normal hair follicle to support rapid growth) and hurt when he pulled.<br />
<br />
Panicked, he kicked off his pants finding his feet had elongated into something strange and his hands seemed stretched out, looking back in the mirror to get a wider view of himself he gasped in horror as another nightmare unfolded his face was deforming as he watched! His eyes were shifting up and back as his nose and jaw were pulling forward. His tailbone suddenly demanded he reposition himself and his new reaction time sent him leaping to his new feet. The guard hairs were now so thick Jeff didnt notice the thick fur coming in underneath, only that he seemed to double in size as the fur gave his hair volume.<br />
<br />
Looking behind him, his tailbone had turned into a tail and hair was rapidly coating it. Being unfamiliar with how to safely stand like this, he carefully braced himself before trying to free it from the confines of his boxers.<br />
<br />
Then, over the next thirty seconds it all reversed. Jeff was left dumbfounded in disbelief. The process didn&#39;t have enough nutrients to complete, so it didn&#39;t. Jeff didn&#39;t see a werewolf, he saw a super hairy, tall guy with a really ugly face. <br />
<br />
An orc without tusks? With a tail? And that is the moment Jeff was sure he imagined it. Despite this he checked his legs before walking and made sure he didn&#39;t have a tail, He put his clothes back on, ran downstairs and grabbed a quick bite to eat (Meal 9 by 9pm) and went to bed.<br />
<br />
Throughout the night his body kept testing its transformative capabilities much in the same way men get erections throughout the night... Testing the equipment. Pushing his body a little further each time.</p>
