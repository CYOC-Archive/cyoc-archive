<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna was actually leaning heavily towards a &quot;no&quot;, to push the old Wizard&#39;s hand out of the way. She is a pretty kinky woman, sure, but at the end of the day she&#39;s still very straight edge, she didn&#39;t have any desire to experiment with gender and that kind of thing, she didn&#39;t want to be a man even if that would somehow make her a more interesting or modern person. Too bad that she just stood there frozen and too slow to react in any way and so before she knew it the Mask reached her face and she felt its cold hard surface press gently against her delicate, refined features. She raises her hands quickly to try and remove it but the Wizard grabs her wrists. <br />
<br />
As soon as it made contact she could feel the inside of the Mask turning wet and fleshy and sticky and she gasps, realizing it was too late to protest. Just like the Wizard said, the process was almost instantaneous this time. The Mask expanded down over her entire body, encasing her in a new layer of dark skin and underneath this thin layer she could feel the new layers of fat and muscle develop and reshape her entire silhouette accompanied by a faint, gross and wet noise. A split second later she could once again feel the new tissue as if it were her own and she turned her head back to the mirror, confirming that she was once again the strange man she&#39;d briefly been earlier. <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t fair, you didn&#39;t even ask me if I wanted this...&quot; She tells the Wizard as she touches the handsome African male face, looking a bit depressed. Her deep male voice also sounded glum. &quot;This isn&#39;t me, whoever this is I can&#39;t pretend to be him...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If I would have asked you, you&#39;d still be Anna right now, am I wrong?&quot; The Wizard responds with a question of his own. <br />
Anna frowns, &quot;But I am still Anna, what are you saying?&quot; She blinks a few times at the absurdity of the Wizard&#39;s statement. <br />
<br />
The Wizard unceremoniously unclasps her strained black bra and throws it in the nearby trash bin. He smiles and grabs Anna by the arm, taking her to a surprisingly spacious dressing room. &quot;Be a good boy and take off those ill fitting leggings, will you? Let&#39;s get you dressed to really impress that boyfriend of yours!&quot; <br />
<br />
The Wizard brings over a jockstrap, a pair of socks and once Anna put them on she admired herself in the full length mirror for a few seconds, turning sideways and gently cupping her impressive bulge, snugly contained inside the sporty sheath of the jock. She had to admit seeing herself looking this way was oddly satisfying. &quot;So, are you sure you still want to be Anna?&quot; The Wizard asks with a smirk and steps next to her holding up a crisp, freshly ironed white shirt. Anna slides her muscular arms through the sleeves and begins to button up, looking pensive. The shirt felt nice and cool against her new, toned black skin and she felt like with each button fastened she was more open to the idea of turning a new leaf, perhaps at least she could try on a male identity just like she was trying on this shirt. She fastens the top button and says &quot;Not sure, maybe I could try and be someone better than Anna. Someone a bit better dressed for sure, ha ha!&quot; She laughs as she straightens her shirt collar in the mirror. The Wizard smiles and hands her a pair of light blue slacks and black loafers. &quot;Nice to hear you say so. Here, you also might like these.&quot; He says and gives her dark contact lenses. Anna applies the contacts and blinks a couple of times and smiles at her reflection. Her natural light blue eyes were now a deep dark brown, the last bit of her original Caucasian woman appearance now erased. She now looked and sounded like an actual African man. &quot;Much better.&quot; She declares and pulls up her phone with a picture of herself. It was a selfie she had taken that morning. She holds it up next to her face in front of the mirror and makes a serious face. She lets out a deep sigh. &quot;You know, I can feel that this Mask is influencing my mind but to be perfectly honest I don&#39;t think I care anymore. I think it might be for the better. Maybe I am better off not being Anna anymore, I think I should be this strong, well endowed, well dressed man instead.&quot; She closes the picture on the phone. &quot;I&#39;ll need a new name...&quot; <br />
&quot;How about Tyrell?&quot; The Wizard suggests. <br />
&quot;A hundred times yes! My name is Tyrell!!&quot; Anna/Tyrell declares, grinning with satisfaction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tyrell, how about we finish up your look with a nice bowtie?&quot; The Wizard suggests. <br />
&quot;Yes please!!!&quot; Tyrell beams. <br />
The Wizard picks up a selection of various bowties and he spends more than an hour tying each of them around Tyrell&#39;s neck in combination with a few different shirts. Each time Tyrell would go back to examine himself in the mirror. He soon realized that he quickly fell in love with formal shirts and ties, both how they look and how they feel. He also insisted that the Wizard taught him how to tie them himself and the old man happily obliged. <br />
Once finally settled on a white shirt and a rainbow colored bowtie, Tyrell was preparing to say goodbye to the Wizard and return home. He hugged the old man and thanked him for everything. As he was about to leave, the old Wizard pulled out a LGBT pride pin and stuck it on Tyrell&#39;s chest. Next he pulled up a condom and stuck it in Tyrell&#39;s shirt pocket. <br />
&quot;Now that you are a man you should protect yourself properly. I hope you have fun with your boyfriend, Tyrell.&quot; <br />
&quot;Thank you, I will!! I&#39;ll make him forget Anna and love me so we can be a gay interracial couple.&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey, take it easy though, remember you are still actually Anna. Don&#39;t let the Mask&#39;s personality take that much control over you, I told you it&#39;s dangerous.&quot; <br />
&quot;But this is a better personality... I want it to take over, why not let it happen and be a cooler person?&quot; <br />
The Wizard slaps him/her lightly. &quot;You fool, you really want to lose yourself to become a prisoner in your own body?&quot; <br />
&quot;...No.&quot; <br />
&quot;Good, perhaps I haven&#39;t been clear enough. This Mask doesn&#39;t just give you the appearance of another person, an entire, very real and very distinct identity is generated as well. In your case Tyrell. Tyrell IS an entirely real and entirely separate person and while you wear the Mask he will be fighting for control of your mind and body. Do you understand? You have to keep him at bay, if he takes over you fully you&#39;ll be like in a coma until the Mask is removed. Do you want that?&quot; <br />
&quot;No!...&quot; <br />
&quot;Of course you don&#39;t! And worse even, if that happens of course &quot;Tyrell&quot; would never willingly remove the Mask, making it very difficult to save you. Even with force it wouldn&#39;t come off easily once in that state and furthermore some may argue that at that point it would even be wrong to remove it since it would be violence against Tyrell.&quot; <br />
&quot;What? Why? What about saving me?...&quot; <br />
&quot;At that point you would BE him and he would have full rights to exist. Why kill an innocent man to release a foolish girl?&quot; <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how to feel about that... I feel like I should still count more than an artificial identity...&quot; <br />
&quot;You do count, but question is who are you? Anna or Tyrell?&quot; <br />
&quot;I see your point, I think... well I AM Anna, I don&#39;t want to be this guy forever!&quot; <br />
&quot;Good. Don&#39;t forget yourself.&quot; <br />
&quot;I won&#39;t! Thank you...&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that Anna leaves the magic store, thinking about what she was told as she walked towards home, playing with her rainbow colored bowtie and not sure if she felt ashamed or proud.</p>
