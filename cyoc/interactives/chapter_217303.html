<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff went to school.<br />
<br />
In first period Gender Studies, the teacher taught that there were one-thousand-six-hundred-and-ninety-two genders. In second period History, there was a chart that said that the first musical instruments were created about 43,000 years ago. In third period Science, the teacher taught how to tell the difference between science and pseudoscience and why creation science and intelligent design is considered pseudoscience (unfalsifiable cherry picking and many of the leaders outright lie in order to fleece their flocks). In fourth period Theology, according to the Bible, there are only two genders, the Earth is only about 6,000 years old, and Christians are supposed to test everything.<br />
<br />
At lunch, Jeff noticed the jocks sat with the jocks, the nerds sat with the nerds, the Blacks sat with the Blacks, the Asians sat with the <br />
Asians, the Hispanics sat with the Hispanics, the Whites sat with the whites, the Christians sat with the Christians, the Muslims sat with the Muslims, the Atheists sat with the Atheists, the straights sat with the straights, the gays sat with the gays and the trans sat with the trans. All these divisions that people could not cross where people did not get along. Jeff sat with the white Christian nerds like he&#39;d always done. He looked over at Paul who sat with the white Christian jocks. Paul had the best body and Jeff wanted to know if Paul&#39;s cock was as big as the rest of him. Then Jeff looked over at Jeremy who sat with the gays. Not only did Jeremy have a great body, he also had a great personality. The other gays dressed fabulously and Jeremy was the only gay who seemed down to earth. Jeff wanted to get to know him better but he dare not cross the line.<br />
<br />
Jeff was confused and depressed. Maybe he wanted to be a pencil or maybe he wanted to be a musical instrument. Maybe he wanted to be an animal or maybe he wanted to be a female. Jeff didn&#39;t know who he was. Throughout the day, Jeff touched several objects and people making copies he might try to become at some later date.<br />
<br />
After Physical Education, Jeff went to shower. The locker room had been remodeled by adding several privacy booths for those who wanted to change in private. Most of the boys used the privacy booths and wore swimsuits in the shower. Oliver and Jack were the only two boys who showered naked. They were both from Australia and were best friends. They had average bodies, good looking but not particularly muscled. They often talked about the local naturist club and how much fun they had there. Today, Jeff decided to join them. He took off his swimsuit and showered at the same six-headed showering pole they did. He asked questions and learned about the nudist club. Oliver and Jack invited Jeff to join them one day.<br />
<br />
The next two classes were Math and English. In English, the teacher gave them an assignment to pick a song, find the lyrics and then write an essay about it.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave his brother, Ryan, a ride home, then invited Jason over. He showed them both the Chronivac and with their approval, gave both of them the same shapeshifting powers he had. They held hands in a circle.<br />
<br />
Then Ryan stripped off his clothes to prevent them from ripping as he transformed into Jason. Jason smiled and transformed into Ryan causing his pants to fall off and his shirt to hang loosely.<br />
<br />
They talked about spending the day as each other and decided that tomorrow, Ryan would spend the day as Jeff, Jeff would be Jason and Jason would spend the day as Ryan. They spent the rest of the evening telling each other about themselves so they could impersonate each other without getting each other into trouble.<br />
<br />
At one point, Jeff admitted that he was wondering if he might be one of those one-thousand-six-hundred-and-ninety-two genders he&#39;d heard about. &quot;How many genders do you think there are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason answered, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Most people are male or female but in rare cases, a chromosome can get mutated to be both an X and a Y chromosome at the same time, or in rare cases, a person can have a hormone imbalance leading to a mix of male and female traits, or a person who is one hundred percent physically one gender can have a mental identity of the opposite gender. There are all kinds of things can cause a persons gender identity to be unclear however, they are all rare, not the norm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason added, &quot;If you are thinking of permanently changing your gender, take your time and seriously consider the consequences of such a decision. Some parts of gender change are irreversible. You have an advantage though because you can give being female for a day a try without permanent consequences. Do that sometime. What makes you think you might not be male?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I don&#39;t know that I want to be the rules enforcer that my dad tells me God wants me to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Although there are differences between men and women, some people exaggerate those differences saying that men are from Mars and women are from Venus. You don&#39;t have to be from Mars to be a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stripped and transformed into a copy of Susan. Jeff asked, &quot;Either of you interested in giving sex a try?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;I&#39;m gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan said, &quot;I&#39;m too young. I want to wait until I&#39;m older, not just in body but in mind as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a while, they settled down to watch online videos together, continuing to prepare each other for tomorrow.<br />
<br />
They saw a Karen video titled, &quot;Karen family gets kicked off plane&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s Mom and Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Mom and Dad were yelling at another passenger. This other passenger wore a rainbow t-shirt but otherwise looked like an ordinary man. He sat there and kept calm and quiet. Dad was yelling, &quot;We have children on board. How dare you make a vulgar display in front of children.&quot; Dad kept covering Sarah&#39;s eyes so Sarah couldn&#39;t see the rainbow t-shirt. Mom was yelling, &quot;We are people of God. This drag queen needs to be thrown off the plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s Carl, a friend of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl sat there not talking or doing anything, just minding his own business. Mom slapped Carl. Security threw Mom and Dad off the plane and they dragged Sarah along with them.<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;I hate to say this but it looks like your family is headed for legal and financial trouble. I&#39;d recommend getting a job and taking care of yourself as soon as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
A little later, Jason received a phone call. He changed back into himself to answer it. Partway through the phone call, Jason told Jeff, &quot;It&#39;s Carl. He&#39;ll be back tomorrow and wants me to pick him up from the airport. He&#39;ll then want to hang out with me on a date and have sex later. I told him about how you would be in my body tomorrow. He still wants you to pick him up from the airport but then it is completely up to you what you want to do with him after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff agreed to pick Carl up.<br />
<br />
When it got late, Jason left to get ready for his night shift. Ryan went to bed.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave masturbation in Susan&#39;s body a try and learned that women have more erogenous zones and multiple orgasms. Then he went to bed.</p>
