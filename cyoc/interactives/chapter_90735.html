<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Tuesday morning, Mark sat at the table eating toast and scrambled eggs, as usual.  Di and Dustin had already left for school, and June was preparing her own breakfast and morning coffee.  June bared a breast and squeezed milk into her coffee, then stirred it and took a satisfied sip.  Mark was reading the newspaper as he drank a glass of June&#39;s milk straight.  <br />
<br />
The headline read: &quot;State governor comes out publicly as an anthropomorph, and will now live permanently in his new form.&quot;  Mark began reading the article.  &quot;State governor Stan Fletcher has been experimenting with anthropomorphs for several years, and has now announced that he will be now be living as one full time.  His chosen morph is a pink flamingo morph, and is a rare cross-gender transformation.  That&#39;s right, the governor is now a woman flamingo-morph and has taken the new name &quot;Stacy Fledgling&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The governor--now governess--has issued the following statement: &quot;I want to assure the citizens of our great state that I will continue to serve them in everything that I do.  Having a body I love will allow me to act for the people in a greater capacity than I ever have before, and I thank you for your continued support.&quot;  The governor&#39;s wife has also expressed happiness and enthusiasm at the change, stating to reporters: &quot;I am so happy that Stacy can finally be who she wants to be.  Our lives have been enriched by this change, and it will enrich the manner in which we interact with the people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark scoffed loudly.  &quot;What&#39;s this world coming to? Now even the governor is a freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s fantastic,&quot; June replied.  &quot;The governor has realized his full potential by becoming a female flamingo-morph.  I&#39;m happy for him--rather her--and her wife.  It would be nice if more people were so brave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;June, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&quot; said Mark angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk to me like that!  Women have long been the support that keeps society from crumbling, and it&#39;s good to have recognition.  If more men acted like women the world would be a better place!&quot; June argued.<br />
<br />
The fight ensued again, as it had every morning.  15 minutes later June stormed out of the house in her tiny minidress, thigh-high fishnets, and 5-inch red stilettos, slamming the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Mark thought to himself.  How could anyone think that being more like a woman could be a good thing?  Then another thought twinged in Mark&#39;s mind.  Women&#39;s underwear was good, wasn&#39;t it?  It was nice to wear... wouldn&#39;t society be better if more men wore women&#39;s underwear...?  Mark shook the thoughts from his head.  But they kept coming back.  He thought about what he had done yesterday.  He had really enjoyed himself wearing June&#39;s underthings.  Maybe he could enjoy himself again?  What could it hurt?  If he just could satisfy his urge and be done with it, he could go back to normal thinking.<br />
<br />
Mark finished his milk and headed into his bedroom.  He closed and locked the door, then stripped himself naked, setting his clothes on his dresser.  He went straight to June&#39;s dresser and opened the drawer.  He gazed at the variety of feminine panties and bras.  He had tried them all on yesterday, and he was getting hard from the anticipation of doing it again.  But she had other things he liked too...<br />
<br />
Mark always criticized June for her job at a sex shop.  The upside of it though, was that June had a rich collection of lingerie.  Mark was thinking about this lingerie.  If a little underwear could make him feel so good, what about the silky, sexy lingerie?<br />
<br />
Still naked, he opened June&#39;s lingerie drawer and pulled out a pink silk nightie.  Without thinking he slipped it over his head.  The straps touched his shoulders and he could feel the softness over his torso.  The fringe touched his bare dick, which was throbbing hard, and Mark nearly lost control right there.  Mark picked through the drawer and found a pink garter belt and white thigh-high stockings.  He clasped the garter belt around his waist, then slid the stockings up his legs one by one and attached them to the garter belt&#39;s clasps.  He stood up and went to the full length mirror...<br />
<br />
Just like yesterday, he looked ridiculous.  But Mark couldn&#39;t help but enjoy seeing the feminine items on his body.  Finally he couldn&#39;t control himself any longer, and cum sprayed from his cock, soiling the nightie, garter belt, and stockings.  Cursing, Mark removed the items and stuffed them deep into the hamper, underneath the other clothes.  Mark hoped that June wouldn&#39;t notice and simply throw them into the wash with everything else.  She probably wouldn&#39;t get to it until this weekend anyway...<br />
<br />
Mark cursed himself.  He felt so ashamed.  How could he be doing this to himself?  His thoughts were anguished, but then his gaze fell on his wife&#39;s dresser once again, and his mind felt calmer, more peaceful, at the prospect of wearing more lingerie.  He stepped over to the drawer again...<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s experimenting went on for the rest of the day.  He found that he was enjoying himself immensely, but at the same time he felt sick from shame.  He relieved himself several more times over the day.  Finally while Mark was admiring himself in a purple satin nightie with lots of frills, as well as a black thong and fishnets, he was horrified to hear the door open.  Quickly he rushed to the bedroom door and made sure it was locked.  He stubbed his toe and silently cursed, falling against the door with a thud.  He pulled the lingerie from his body as fast as he could, and doing his best to make sure it was tidy, he shoved them into the drawer and slammed it shut.  Then he rushed to put on his normal clothes.<br />
<br />
A moment later Mark emerged from the room and looked around.  He looked at the clock and realized that is must have been Dustin who came home, and had already gone upstairs.  Breathing a sigh of relief, Mark closed and locked the bedroom door again, then set about making sure everything was the way it had started this morning.  He made sure everything was neatly folded and in the proper drawers, in the place he had found them.  The only thing out of place was the first set of clothes he had spoiled that morning and stuffed into the hamper.  He hoped his wife wouldn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
Mark decided to just watch TV until June got home.  He turned on a ball game and promptly fell asleep on the couch.  The night progressed normally after that.  June made her famous creamy mac-n-cheese for dinner.  Mark watched TV for the rest of the night while June seemed to be doing some paperwork for her business.  The two retired to bed with hardly a word spoken between them.</p>
