<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Brittany and Jake are here,” Michael speaking as he pulls into the driveway of Edward and Julian Heartpaw’s residence. The chance to get together for a summer holiday BBQ party was too good to resist; the promise of fireworks for the cubs and some after hour’s adult time to help to sell the event. Not that Michael needed convincing, nor Denise. Their cub Roxy, an anthro tigress cub with a cream brown fur belly and chest was bouncing excitedly as she strained to get out of the car seat her parents were mindful of strapping her in.<br />
“Party Party!” Roxy kept shouting as her mother worked the belts to free her from the seat. The cub full of energy managed to squirm her way out of her mother’s grasp and made a mad dash to the open gate.<br />
“And she’s off,” Michael chuckling as he grabs a couple bottles of wine; both he and Denise following as they watch their daughter jump and pounce her half-brother’s Jimmy and Jake.<br />
<br />
“Well we know someone is excited,” the elder anthro stag-deer fury speaking as Denise walks over to peel her cub off of the twin stag-deer furies. “Roxy is just bundle of energy,” Michael putting down the wine. “How is your cub Edward,” Michael looking at the fox fury as he starts putting the chicken on a plate.<br />
“Adam is already having fun with Jimmy J.R,” Edward looking at the two cougar cubs hanging around a backyard swing set; the two year old cub bouncing around the slide. “As for your grand cubs Dusk and Dawn,” Edward looking at the shady area on his daughter’s half of the back yard; “skulking. The pink look is clearly a fashion statement the twins are not liking.”<br />
“I can imagine,” Michael aware of Jake’s progeny getting into trouble at the school; “but they are young. So they&#39;ll grow out of that behavior.”<br />
“One can hope,” Edward taking the chicken to the table.<br />
<br />
“My goodness,” Julian having a hard time keeping an eye on the anthro tigress cub as she tore through the combined yard; “did you give her sugar for breakfast?”<br />
“No,” Denise accepting the beer that the female anthro cougar was offering; “she is just excited to be with her older brothers. The fireworks for the even are what she can’t wait for.”<br />
“Hopefully she doesn’t tire herself out until then,” Julian sipping her beer as she watches Roxy dash towards Dusk and Dawn. Practically bowling the two over with hugs and kisses before running back towards them.<br />
<br />
“Why did Dusk and Dawn paint themselves,” Roxy looking at her mother; “can I be painted too?”<br />
“That is a paint job you don’t want,” Denise picking up her daughter with one arm; “and you are getting too big for these jump hugs you like so much. Why don’t you go play with Jimmy J.R and Adam over by the swing.”<br />
“Okay,” Roxy hopping down before running towards the two over by a slide.<br />
“She is looking to be passed out before sunset,” Julian chuckling as the energetic cub gambles about the swing.<br />
“When do the fireworks begin,” Denise watching her mate fiddling with the BBQ only to be chased off by an Anthro fox with tongs; “can’t Michael take the day off from being in front of a grille?”<br />
“And hour after sunset,” Juliian chuckling as the anthro stag get chided for kibitzing the cook.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“All right you two,” Lucas looking at his twin sons Oliver and Paul; two year old wolf cub furys who’s white coat of fur have a tinge of tawny brown at their tails and ears. “There is plenty of food, family and lots of fun to be had,” Lucas helping Oliver as Rachael works on the belts keep Paul secure. “So have fun!”<br />
“Yay,” the two say in unison as they run from their parents grasp and rush to where the sounds of a party could be heard.<br />
<br />
Lucas and Rachael could hear a couple of grunts and groans followed by happy squeals as they slowly walked to the backyard. The anthro wolf fury carrying a box of pastries while his mate, an anthro lioness fury had in her paws a plate of deviled eggs covered in cling wrap.<br />
“Big sis,” Oliver starts caterwauling as a large anthro Wolf fury smiles as he and Paul dance around the woman who came back outside from using the washroom earlier. Catching the arrival of Lucas and Rachael Soulfang, Brittany couldn’t help but rush over and hug her parents just as they put down the items they were carrying.<br />
“Mom, Dad,” Brittany squeezing the two; she chuckles as she could feel the tiny arms of her twin brothers squeezing her legs; “and you two scamps. How have you been?”<br />
“Exhausted,” Lucas being the first to speak; “your brothers are running us ragged.”<br />
Trade you some petulant twins who look like death warmed over,” Brittany pointing to the direction as to where Dusk and Dawn are hiding.<br />
“I take it they are still bitter over their punishment,” Lucas looking at his grand cubs as they purposely stay away from the groups. Seeing that both the charcoal grey furred wolf fury and tawny brown furred doe fury as sporting pink fur thanks to their mother as a punishment for causing trouble at school.<br />
“Bitter is an appropriate word,” Brittany nodding; “but they brought this on themselves and they need to learn that there is a fine line to pranks and plain hooliganism.”<br />
“Maybe I’ll talk to them,” Lucas smiling; “Perhaps I can impress upon them to stop being trouble makers.”<br />
<br />
“Worth a shot,” Brittany sounding exasperated as Lucas walks towards the shade to see his grandcubs looking glum.<br />
“Are you two just going to stay here and wallow in misery,” Lucas looking at the fraternal twins; “come and spend time with family. Oliver and Paul would like to get to know their niece and nephew.”<br />
“We don’t feel like it,” Dawn speaking for the both of them; eyeing the empty bowl that had chips in it and then eyeing the table full of food. Lucas picked up on what his granddaughter was thinking of and came up with an ideal.<br />
“Then I guess there is more food for the rest of us,” Lucas taking the empty bowl away; “unless of course you’re hungry, then by all means join us.”<br />
<br />
The two just sit in silence as their grandfather took away the bowl that had their chips and walked towards the table as everyone began to head towards. Dusk was the first to get up and head over, the smell of hot dogs and hamburgers making him hungry; over riding his embarrassing situation. Dawn seethes as she watches her older brother leave her for food instead of plotting. Finding her own hunger demanding attention, she reluctantly gets up to join the family gathering; still pondering how to torment her cousin Jimmy J.R and get under her mother’s fur.</p>
