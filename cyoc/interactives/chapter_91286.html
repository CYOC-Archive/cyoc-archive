<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelsey was pretty busy over the remaining week but the idea of a date kept intruding and every time it did a sense of dread and excitement overwhelmed her. Friday night she couldn&#39;t sleep with thoughts running through her head. &#39;Why would he want to date me?&#39; &#39;What am I going to do on the date?&#39; &#39;what if I fart?&#39; &#39;What if I embarrass him?&#39; She tossed and turned all night and Saturday she had two birthday parties and a bachelor party. The day dragged on as she tried to focus on her job but the kids screamed to loud and the guys groped her too much for her. By the time she made it home she dropped on her bed with a fart momentarily lifting her off it. Closing her eyes in exhaustion almost falling asleep sitting up before her mom knocked on the door snapping her awake.<br />
&quot;Hey hon, getting ready for her date?&quot; A look of panic filled her and it must have shown because her mom came over and gave her a hug. &quot;I know things haven&#39;t been easy with you being clowned and your brother but you are strong. I think he really likes you and you can do this.&quot;<br />
&quot;But why does he like me? I mean look at me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so old fashioned, there are tons of mixed couples now. And you said he had a clowned brother too. Plus look at you, you are beautiful and the largest clown in the world. What guy wouldn&#39;t like you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom&quot; Kelsey gave her a big hug and with new energy she opened her closet and looked for something to wear. By 7:15 she still had not decided and she heard the doorbell ring. Panic again set in as she realized it must be Jay, she quickly grabbed a purple and yellow polka dotted dress and scrambled to get ready. She heard talking coming from the living room and promised to give her mom a big hug for buying her time. Pausing to take some deep breaths she calmed herself and looked in the mirror. Her normal silly self looked back under large pink hair and a purple and yellow dress. Despair filled her, what did Jay see in her? Sighing she went to meet him. His mom was making small talk and looked up as she came in. Jay jumped up and started to walk over to her. Her heart beat fast as all doubt vanished along with all thought as his arms encircled her and she felt his lips touch hers. She closed her eyes as warmness filled her, her breath caught and her large clit started to throb. The moment seemed to last forever till she heard something. She snapped her eyes open as she realized he was no longer kissing her. She stared blankly at Jay till a “Huh?” came out of her mouth. <br />
&quot;I said are you ready to go?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yes. I have been looking forward to it.&quot; The blush on her face deepening. He took her hand, her four large fingers fitting perfectly between his five, and thanked her mom before opening the door for her. They walked to the car and he opened her door just like a real gentlemen. Getting in and starting the car he turned and asked &quot;Had a good week?&quot;<br />
&quot;I have been really busy, I have been trying to help out mom with some money so I have had a lot of gigs. Today I had three.&quot; At the stop light her turned to her stroking her cheek with his warm soft hand &quot;I&#39;m sorry. You must be tired.&quot; giving her a sympathetic look. Scared that she might be scaring him off she quickly tried to backtrack. &quot;No, it is ok, I am use to it. I have been looking forward to this all week.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad. How about this, we drive through somewhere and then go to this nice quite park and just have a evening picnics?&quot; Kelsey smiled &quot;Sounds great.&quot; They picked up some food and Jay drove them over to the park and pulled in, they were the only car there. Getting out she saw Jay may a quick movement over to her side of the car and kicked herself, he was going to open the door for me. Jay grabbed the food and her hand again and they wandered the park till the found a quiet and secluded by the creek. Laying down they talked and laughed. He opened up to her about his brother and all his struggles when he got clowned, he got downsized to a three foot clown from a tall basketball player with college ball dreams. Kelsey felt that she could open up to him about all her problems and her brother’s tragedy. She got lost in his blue eyes and realized that they were getting closer. She felt the kiss and responded back opening their mouths and their tongues started to wrestle. Her nose rubbed on his cheek sending jolts of pleasure down her body, her clit started to tingle and she felt a dampness start to form between her legs. Her hand found his thigh and followed it up to his crotch and felt a bulge growing there. Encouraged by a moan from Jay she undid his pants and slipped her hand into his boxers, wrapping her large hand around his cock feeling it pulse and throb in her hand. She stroked him up and down causing him to moan and kiss her back hard, his hands found the way up her shirt and into her bra. Cupping her large white breast he massaged it working his way up till he found her erect nipples and tweaked the balls causing little squeaks to be added to their moans. Breaking the kiss she pushed him down and moved down to his crotch. Trying to pull down his pants and boxers Jay lifted his butt to make it easier and kicked off his shoes. His dick sprung free of the cloth restraint and stood at attention leaking precum. Kelsey grasped it in one hand and turning her head to the side she licked it from base to tip catching all the precum flowing out before she took the tip in her mouth and rolled her tongue around it. Jay bucked against her trying to get more of it in her mouth, his arms going out and gripping the green grass and let out a loud groan of bliss. Thrill at making Jay feel this good made Kelsey feel good and powerful and she relented and slowly descended on to his dick and STOPPED....... Her nose hit his bush and prevented her from getting more than an inch or two of him in her mouth. Kelsey stayed there not knowing what to do and Jay looked down and laughed. Kelsey jumped back in embarrassment but Jay sat up and took her in his arms and kissed her. His hands found their way inside her shirt again before for he lifted it off her and snaked his hands around and freed her massive breasts from her bra. Leaning down took off his shirt and found her nipple and took it in his mouth sucking on it and rolling it around while his hand played with the other. Laying her down, he kissed his way down to her stomach before stripping off her dress and panties. The cup protecting her clit fell out and Kelsey  blushed again with embracement.<br />
&quot;Wow&quot; Jay said in amazement as his fingertips stroke her large clit. Now it was Kelsey&#39;s turn to jump and moan as pleasure rolled through her. Jay reversed his position and laid on his side his dick by Kelsey&#39;s head and Kelsey got the idea and moved into 69 position. She once again took him in her mouth and went down on him. Her nose hit his legs but he opened them and she was able to get most of his cock in her mouth, her nose running along his balls. Jay continued to finger her clit as Kelsey sucked his dick for all she was worth and she was rewarded with a steady stream of precum. Jay was struggling on his end, he could not stretch around her big round stomach to get that large wonderful clit in his mouth and struggled to make it as he tweaked it. Kelsey felt him grow in her mouth and suddenly he was hitting the back of her throat or was she able to get more of him in? She paused and looked at his dick not able to measure it from this position before shrugging, licking the head and going down on him once more. The head hit the back of her throat and she relaxed letting it pass. Her bright red lips ran over the surface as she sucked harder and the dick went further down her throat each time. Jay suddenly found himself able to reach her clit and took it in his mouth sucking on it as he finger her sopping wet pussy. Jay and Kelsey started to shake as their orgasms approached and sped up their efforts feeling each other getting close. Jay&#39;s hand squeezed her butt hard as he sucked on her clit before squeezing hard as his orgasm hit. Kelsey felt him stiffen and his dick start to pulse, she quickly backed off so all his delicious cum would hit her tongue. She lapped it up and this was enough to push her over the edge too. Sparks exploded before her eyes as her pussy clapped down around his fingers leaking juice. Kelsey heard a high pitch scream and realized it was her own as the orgasm washed over her bigger even than the one in the car. Her vision went blank as pleasure racked her body, she had to force herself to breath as it continued. As her vision slowly returned she saw a long hard dick leaking cum and she quickly licked it up not wanting any to go to waste. Jay crawled around and took her in his arms as they enjoyed the moment, her white skin glowing under the moonlight against his darker tan skin. <br />
They stayed that way for who knows how long till a cool breeze finally woke them up to the fact that they should probably get dressed. Kelsey shivered and reluctantly broke the embrace and found her clothes and started to get dressed. Jay looked at her with a smile on his face before finding his own and started to get dressed. Jay slipped on his pants and underwear before leaning over to get his shoes on. He looked up at Kelsey almost done dressing.<br />
&quot;I had fun thank you.&quot; <br />
&quot;So did I&quot; He stood up and slipped his shirt over his head and leaned in for a kiss.<br />
&quot;So we can do it again?&quot; He dropped his shirt but suddenly backed away and looked down. Kelsey suddenly confused looked down and he was holding his shirt down but it did not even cover his stomach and his pants were up over his socks. His bellybutton was showing on his smooth pale skin that was starting to glow in the moonlight.<br />
&quot;Huh, look at that.&quot; He said blankly still looking down. Kelsey backed away in horror at the realization at what was happening.<br />
&quot;NO, No&quot; she screamed &quot;I&#39;m so sorry&quot; visions over her brother flashed in her mind. &quot;no&quot; she whimpered.<br />
Jay looked up at her, she turned and started to run. &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; she sobbed as tears started to flow.<br />
&quot;No, wait&quot; he called to her but she kept running. Suddenly she tripped and landed belly first and found herself bouncing up in the air away from Jay. She landed on her butt and bounced again before finally getting her feet under her and kept running.<br />
She ran home and burst through the door still in tears. Her mom jumped at the sight of her but leapt off the couch and hugged her daughter trying to comfort her.<br />
&quot;Honey, what happened?&quot; Kelsey trying to explain but all she could do was cry and blubber. She sat her down on the couch till she was calm enough to speak. She looked at her mom with tears in her eyes. &quot;Mom, I turned him into a clown.&quot; and broke into fresh tears.</p>
