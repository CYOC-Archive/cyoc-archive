<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what do you wanna do tonight,&quot; Kellie asked. &quot;Not sure,&quot; Mary Elise responded. &quot;I&#39;ve got a couple of personal days that I used for this occasion but it&#39;s getting close to the end of school year and I still need to finish the final grades for my students.&quot; &quot;Come on Mary,&quot; Claudia sighed. &quot;Mika and I are only in town til Sunday. It could be along time before we come back.&quot;  &quot;There are a couple of good bars downtown,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;I know the owners we can bypass the line.&quot; &quot;Loved to but my stupid ID has already been rejected twice.&quot; Kellie groaned. &quot;Let me see,&quot; Tricia asked. Kellie began rummaging through her purse producing her license and handing it over to Tricia. &quot;Huh that&#39;s weird,&quot; Tricia stated. &quot;It&#39;s your birthday except twenty years early with a picture that looks like your mom. Did you check this out when they handed it to you?&quot;  &quot;Yea it seemed fine at the time,&quot; Kellie exclaimed. The women now began to discuss the mystery of the unusual ID Katie began to get nervous and felt the need to change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kellie,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you and your friends come back to our house. We could watch movies and order pizza and just all hang out together.&quot; The five women looked at Katie and began to laugh. &quot;Thanks for the offer kiddo,&quot; Kellie said while patting her head. &quot;But I think we&#39;re going to do something a little bit more grown up.&quot; Katie began to sulk in her chair. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it kid,&quot; Mika said. &quot;It&#39;s a nice offer but we haven&#39;t gone out as a group in a few years.&quot; Mika&#39;s kind words didn&#39;t help the situation. &quot;You know we like hanging out with you at the beach but we&#39;re a little too old to just eat pizza and watch movies all night.&quot; Katie glanced up at Mika as she finished her sentence. A thought began to form in her head. &quot;Mary Elise can you help me out on this.&quot; Mika asked. Mary Elise approached Katie with a kind smile on her face. &quot;Don&#39;t be in such a hurry to grow up Katie,&quot; she said. &quot;Going out to the bar isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be. Sometimes I wish i was still your age. Things are alot simpler when your a kid.&quot; That last sentence did it for Katie she may not want to grow up anymore but she could certainly make the others grow down. Silently she wished for all the girls to be 10 years old again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Kellie,&quot; Katie whispered as the ring began to glow. &quot;You say something kiddo,&quot; Kellie asked. &quot;Nope,&quot; Katie answered quickly as she began to watch the regression unfold. The first changes were subtle as the women left their mid 20s and entered their early 20s. Their skin began to glow with youth as they slowly began to relive their college years in reverse. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re graduating from college in two weeks,&quot; a now 22 year old Mary Elise stated as she absent-mindedly pushed the strap of her sundress onto her shoulder. &quot;This time next year I might be teaching at your school Katie. Don&#39;t worry though I won&#39;t assign too much homework.&quot; She winked and smiled Katie. In her mind she had always viewed Katie as a kid sister. Her flawless skin glowed and her auburn hair began to take a more reddish tone. &quot;Forget that,&quot; Mika said as she slipped from 22 to 21. &quot;I haven&#39;t spent the last 18 years going to school just to work in one for the rest of my life.&quot; Mika brushed her ebony bangs out of her eyes and adjusted her flowing purple sundress.. For some reason it seemed to fit poorly around her hips and chest. She wondered if the exercise she had started was beginning to work. &quot;What about you Claudia do you want to work in a school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie glanced over at a now 20 year old Claudia. The beach robe she was begining to swallow her up the sleeves of the robe slid just past her wrists. Her body continued to youthen, although covered by a robe Katie could she that she was a slender teenage beauty, probably a cheerleader in high school. &quot;School was fun but I&#39;ve got bigger plans,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell you guys but I was approached by a modeling agency. They want me to participate in a couple of their shoots. My folks already checked into it and its legit.&quot; &quot;Thats awesome,&quot; 19 year old Tricia stated adjusting her now overly large moo moo. Tricia&#39;s body was beginning to slim out considerably her d cups had shrunk to c cups and her hips and rear began to flatten. Although curvy for a teenager she was no where near the  curvaceous beauty  of a few minutes before. &#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; 18 year old Samantha questioned. &quot; I mean we&#39;re about to finish high school. We&#39;ve got our whole lives ahead of us.&quot; Samantha adjusted her one piece swimsuit. Why is this swimsuit so big she thought as she tied her long brown hair back in a ponytail. I must of grabbed mom&#39;s suit by mistake. She kicked her beach sandals back onto her feet as they seemed to slip of her foot. &quot;Huh,&quot; she thought. &quot;I really must not of been paying attention when I got dressed. These look like moms.&quot; The 17 year old shrugged and continued to talk with her friends.<br />
<br />
Katie at the changes that occurred as the women left their 17th year and became 16. The mature faces of their twenties was replaced with  youthful teenage faces. Katie noticed the the women were now getting shorter as they aged backwards. Katie marveled as the grew shorter millimeter by millimeter in short bursts. &quot;Hey Kiddo,&quot; Kellie exclaimed. &quot;Where should we drive tonight.&quot; Katie was shocked by the youthful tone in her 16 soon to be 15 year old mom. Her former moms face was almost unrecognizable from the stern 43 year old visage she was used to. It also didn&#39;t help that she was a couple of inches shorter than usual. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Katie stammered. &quot;What do you think.&quot; &quot;Like I don&#39;t know,&quot; Kellie exclaimed. &quot;I think theirs a party that the seniors are holding later on in the woods. Whose up for keg beer and cute guys.&quot; The five girls gave embarrassed and giddy laughter. &quot;Come on Kellie,&quot; 15 year old Mary Elise exclaimed. &quot;None of us are old enough to drive.Besides were only freshmen the seniors don&#39;t want to be with us.&quot;  &quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; 15 year old Claudia stated throwing back her long blond hair. &quot;Joey Simpson wants to take men to movie this weekend.&quot; &quot;Wow,&quot; 15 year old Samantha gasped. &quot;The quarterback wants to date you.&quot; The girls squealed with delight and began talking quickly about maybe finally kissing a high school boy.<br />
<br />
Katie marveled at what was happening as she watched the girls re-enter their 14th year, leaving high school behind and entering junior high. Most of the girls bodies had regressed to a point where hips were barely flared and breasts had been reduced to a and small b cups. Only Tricia maintained a sizable bust size but that to was quickly disappearing. The sound of something falling to the floor. Glancing down Katie noticed that Mikas shoes had fallen to the floor leaving her barefoot. 13 year old Mika was the shortest and youngest looking of the group a fact Claudia kept reminding her of much to her chagrin. Her toes were now the only thing touching the floor, which upset her slightly. She tried to slip her tiny feet back into her cavernous shoes to no avail. Sighing she tucked her thin legs under her now cavernous sundress. Katie looked at the others there shoes were barely hanging onto their shrinking feet. There feet also were beginning to slowly lift off the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you okay,&quot; 12 year old Mary Elise asked. &quot;You look a little pale.&quot; Katie glanced at red haired girl in front of her. A spattering of freckles now covered her nose and cheeks. The sundress she wore hung on her like a sack and she continually had to push her hat up as it slid over her head. Katie smiled not just at her comical appearance but her kind words. Mary Elise at any age seemed to be a kind and gentle soul. &quot;I&#39;m fine thanks,&quot; Katie said. Mary Elise smiled pushing the useless straps back on her diminutive shoulders.&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Mary Elise started before glancing towards the floor. Her beach sandals had fallen off her feet, which dangled slightly of the floor. Scooting up in her chair Mary Elise placed her bare feet on the floor choosing not to put on her overly large shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re going to be in junior high next year,&quot; 11 year old Samantha exclaimed while trying to push the straps of her swimsuit up. &quot;Do you think the teachers will be nice?&quot; &quot;Who cares,&quot; 11 year old Claudia exclaimed. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to go to the junior high dances.&quot; Katie smiled watching Claudia. The robe the 11 year old wore hung down past her knees with the sleeves going several inches past her hands. Although not much taller than Mika Katie thought she looked like a girl you would see in those child beauty pageants. Even at this young age it was apparent the little blond girl was boy crazy. <br />
<br />
As the girls left there 11th year and stopped at their 10th Katie looked at disbelief what lay in front of her. Mary Elise was a skinny girl with straight red hair and a cute face spattered with freckles. Claudia with her long blond hair angelic face and firecracker attitude. Tricia with shoulder length black and flawless milk chocolate. she was also the tallest of the group. Samantha with brown hair almost falling to her waist with a beautiful childish face that belied her renewed innocence. Mika with shoulder length black hair and a cute childish face. She always wanted to prove she belonged  to make up for her small size. Finally Katie looked at her former mom, former big sister Kellie. Kellie was a couple of inches smaller and slightly heavier than her now twin sister. Kellie was extrovert of the group with a sunny attitude that would light up the room. Her and her sister were the best of friends and the girls they hung out with had been close since kindergarten. They were inseparable and treated each other more like sisters than friends. Katie sat back and glanced at her work, her day was about to get a whole lot more fun.</p>
