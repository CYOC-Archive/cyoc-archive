<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Appearing on a barren parch of beach, Rick stumbled, quickly regaining his footing before glaring at Casseus. &quot;Where are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A small island off the coast of Canada.&quot; Casseus replied. &quot;This is about as far as my magic could take us. We need to regroup.&quot; Rick frowned, gazing around the beach before turning back to Casseus.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should have stayed. The wizards had a temporary advantage.&quot; Casseus raised an eyebrow, shaking his head before speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Against one or two perhaps,&quot; he stated, watching the teen carefully. &quot;However, against nine? It was only a matter of time. The Harris women, the seraphim Katie and her wife, the dragoness, the psychic, not to mention their spouses and siblings. The battle was lost as soon as they all appeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet you paralyzed the psychic.&quot; Rick countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; Casseus answered. &quot;But she was a much different and less experienced wizard. Now? That woman&#39;s powers alone would prove troublesome. Add the Harris women, the Davis family, and Katie the first Catalyst with her wife and we were doomed the moment Demeter left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick grunted in annoyance, once more looking out at the ocean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did she abandon us like that?&quot; Rick asked in annoyance. &quot;Our mission was to eliminate the younger ones as well as the older wizards. Why would she leave like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus shook his head, for as powerful as Rick was, he still had alot to learn about magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reach out with your magic,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;Search for the Boss.&quot; Rick sighed, closing his eyes as he searched for the Boss. These types of location spells always bored him. In all his lessons he focused more on spells that would help in battle. These lessons were forced and quite boring if he was being honest. As he no searched for the Boss, his eyes flew open in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t sense him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Casseus replied softly. &quot;Meaning he has been neutralized. Whether he&#39;s dead or his magic is bound is up for debate. Regardless, he is no longer any use to us.&quot; Rick nodded, his head swimming. The Boss defeated? It didn&#39;t seem possible. After so many battles, so many victories, how could he possibly lose? &quot;Do you think it was the Catalyst?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most likely.&quot; Casseus answered. &quot;That boy is far stronger than anyone can fathom. I believed the Boss was stronger, but I could have been wrong.&quot; Rick was quiet for a moment, gazing out at the ocean. It seemed impossible that the man who taught him everything he knew of magic could be defeated. He admired the Boss, his confidence, his charisma, his ability to get things done. Straightening his posture, Rick placed his hands upon his hips. For a moment Casseus admired the teen.<br />
<br />
Rick looked ready to take charge, to lead the Normal. Just listening to the teen&#39;s initial statement he understood why the Boss saw him as his protege. Rick was handsome, confident, strong willed. The brief speech of fulfilling the Boss’s vision and eliminating all who opposed the Normal. Briefly Casseus felt inspired, perhaps Rick&#39;s charisma and strength of character were what the Normal needed. Perhaps this teen, barely old enough to be out of high school, was someone Casseus could follow with the same loyalty he had shown the Boss and Villar. That idea only lasted a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Rick never realized Casseus cast an illusion. As the teen spoke to who he believed to be Casseus, that the real Casseus was behind him. Summoning forth his spear, the Dark wizard thrust, impaling Rick through the back. A sharp gasp was all Rick could emit, his eyes going wide as the spear tore through his chest. Sinking to his knees, the teen gurgled a response as his body fell limp. He could&#39;ve move below his neck as Casseus appeared in front of him. A soft smile cracking across his grey and withered visage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you think I would follow someone like you?&quot; Casseus asked, Rick barely able to gurgle a response as he struggled to breath. &quot;You have strength Rick,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Perhaps you could have been the leader the Normal needed. But...I&#39;m tired of taking orders.&quot; The look of rage on Rick&#39;s face told Casseus everything. The teen never expected this as Casseus raised his hand.<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s death rattles choked out of his crippled body. Whisps of vapor trailing off Rick only to be absorbed by Casseus. The teens body spasm, jerked in unnatural movements as his skin greyed, his body thinning as his eyes rolled into the back of his head. As Casseus drained Rick of his magic, he gazed at the withered, mummified corpse, taking a deep breath.<br />
<br />
Casseus felt energized, his own power mixing with Rick&#39;s and Chenoa&#39;s stolen magic. Flexing his fingers, Casseus could only smile. The Dark Wizards own strength had multiplied ten fold, making him one of the strongest dark wizards on existence. Still, he needed to remain cautious when dealing with wizards.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it everything turned out for the best.&quot; a familiar voice said.<br />
<br />
Casseus turned, watching as Geshp now approached. The devilish S.P.E.A.R agent sporting an impish smirk as he approached. &quot;You can say that,&quot; Casseus replied. &quot;And I see you held up your end of the bargain.&quot; Geshp nodded, bending down to stare at the corpse of Rick. &quot;Out of curiosity Geshp how did you keep Camille at bay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another side deal.&quot; Geshp stated. &quot;With Rick&#39;s death my sister would have to return to the heavens. I promised her to give her Rick&#39;s soul as her eternal companion. Now they will reside in eternal bliss until the end of time.&quot; Casseus chuckled, something told him Rick would rather reside in the underworld alone than to forever have Camille yammering in his ear. &quot;Now about our deal, Casseus.&quot; Geshp stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ring is yours.&quot; Casseus said, reaching down to remove the Ring of Change from Rick&#39;s withered finger. &quot;Tell me, what are your plans now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the mortal realm is much too interesting to want to leave.&quot; Geshp grinned. &quot;And our dear director is going to need my help. After all, the attack on the Morelands has proven to be a trying time.&quot; Casseus nodded, seeing the devil cast him a curious look. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to know anything about that would you Casseus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I did I couldn&#39;t answer.&quot; Casseus smirked. &quot;Although I believe the guilty party may have been dealt with. Perhaps one day the evidence will surface.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not today.&quot; Geshp finished. The Dark wizard and devil now stared at one another in silence. &quot;Stay out of Sarah&#39;s business Casseus and I&#39;ll stay out of yours.&quot; Casseus nodded in agreement, the devil and wizards deal completed as the pair returned to their respective bases, leaving behind the lonely corpse of Rick Morgan.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Casseus returned to the Normal&#39;s headquarters where he found Melissa Fuller waiting for him with a bottle of wine and two wine glasses on the table. He had sent her a message relaying to her the time and place to be when he came back. He was certain if everything turned out as it did, then he would be coming out on top.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I take it it&#39;s all done? Your old boss has been relieved and the brat has been disposed of?&quot; Melissa asked as he opened the wine bottle and poured it into the two glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. Admittedly my old boss had quite the vision. Unfortunately his vision was quite limited. He only thought of what good the future could be for himself. I see of not only what my future could be for myself, but also the world and others in it. Let&#39;s let those who call themselves heroes savor their day of victory. I have big plans ahead for my future.&quot; Casseus said taking a sip of his glass as did Melissa who shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah, Dustin. You mean our future. I&#39;m not in this to be your underling, I&#39;m your partner, first and foremost period. I see us taking this company in a whole new direction with everyone out there under our thumb.&quot; Melissa smirked as Casseus took a long sip of his wine then tossed the bottle on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I love it when you talk like the manipulative bitch that you are.&quot; Casseus said as he gently grasped Melissa&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Dustin. You know how I can get when you act like the bastard you are.&quot; Melissa said with joyful glee as she grabbed Casseus&#39;s groin.<br />
<br />
Dustin and Melissa then got lost with each other as they removed their clothes and proceeded to make love on Casseus&#39;s old boss&#39;s desk.<br />
<br />
&#39;It feels SO good to be on top of the world.&#39; Dustin and Melissa thought as they sealed the deal in their new ownership.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Rick opened his eyes as he looked to be awake on the beach, but there was no spear in him. He didn&#39;t look like he had any wounds to speak of. Yet when he tried his magic, he sensed nothing and no one. When he looked down at his clothes, he saw that he was wearing a white polo shirt and white pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?!&quot; Rick called out. &quot;Is anyone there?!&quot; Rick waited to hear anyone reply then heard a voice from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick! You&#39;re finally here at last!&quot; Rick heard a voice call out to see Camille rushing joyously towards him and embracing him in a hug as they spun around in a circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Camille? What...? What&#39;s going on here? Are we back at the beach? What happened to Casseus? I&#39;ve got to go after him!&quot; Rick shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Rick, don&#39;t you remember what happened? Casseus betrayed you.&quot; Camille said as Rick started to back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;He thrust a spear through your body. You&#39;re dead Rick.&quot; Camille explained gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! No, you....you were supposed to protect me, why didn&#39;t you protect me?!&quot; Rick asked in anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, don&#39;t you see? You would have found no peace on earth. You had thought yourself the biggest fish in the ocean, but no matter how big a fish you think you are, there&#39;s always going to be a bigger fish out there. Now I have brought your soul with me to heaven where we will reside in eternal bliss together....forever!&quot; Camille said happily as Rick tried to run away from her and to another part of the island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, would you like some apples?&quot; Camille said immediately coming out from behind a tree. At this, Rick ran away again to another part of the island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, would you prefer grapes instead?&quot; Camille answered as she came around from another tree in no time.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, this is heaven, there is no time, there is no more space, there is only this: our eternal paradise together. You, me, and this island.&quot; Camille explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;No....no....I....I can&#39;t be....this can&#39;t be....&quot; Rick said as he began panicking and laid down on the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, Rick, it&#39;s okay. Just relax in my lap and listen to me.&quot; Camille said comfortingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This....can&#39;t be happening.&quot; Rick said to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re safe. You&#39;re with me. We&#39;re together.&quot; Camille said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be how it ends for me,&quot; Rick exclaimed. As Camille attempted to soothe his soul, the only thing he could do was scream. The irony of the situation palpable to the gods that watched Rick and Camille with interest. What would be heaven for one would be an eternal hell for the other.</p>
