<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason finally comes back to her senses and feels completely ashamed of what just happened. He tries not to say it out loud not to hurt Sarah, as she is the one without an actual body, so he is trying not to add to it at the moment.<br />
<br />
He decides to go take a shower to making himself feel &#39;clean&#39; again, and asks Sarah if she is willing, and she agrees without much effort.<br />
<br />
Inside of the bathroom there is a large bathtub/shower combo, a toilet, a sink and a few cabinets on the walls with towels and bathroom supplies.<br />
<br />
Jason just undresses quickly and moves into the shower as fast as possible, trying to avoid thinking too much about his situation.<br />
<br />
As starts cleaning himself Sarah starts talking: &quot;I&#39;m curious about how much of me is inside of you, the Doctor told me that there would be some less visible changes from the start because I&#39;m mostly alien to your body, but he said that since your body absorbed a large portion of mine, those parts would start developing as we both &#39;synchronized&#39;, as he put it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason stops to think, before talking, and he examines his body more seriously. He sees that his frame didn&#39;t actually shrink, but his proportions seems to have changed. His old muscle tone is still under the now softer skin he absorbed from Sarah, and maybe his nipples feelings sensible where part of this change. He then stops thinking about it and questions: &quot;The Doctor told you that? I never heard him say anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, he had me awoken throughout most of the procedure, he needed to make sure he wasn&#39;t removing anything important from me when he was adjusting your body, that is why I&#39;m not like, freaking out about it, the shock for me came way before you.&quot; Said Sarah, in a mostly resigned tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait seriously? So he actually explained more of it to you? Like what?&quot; Asked Jason, now curious about this new revelation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, mostly that, since I&#39;ve been absorbed by you, a lot of endocrine, nervous and part of my glangs exist inside of your body. He tried to arrange them to be the most functional as possible, as he didn&#39;t have that much time to work to save us both, as you know, a human body isn&#39;t supposed to have that much redundant organs.&quot; Sarah explained, in an almost lecturing tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Endocr...what? I don&#39;t even understand those words, I never took you for the nerd type&quot; Jason asked, in a confused tone, where most things said just passed through his mind without him being able to parse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Endocrine, you know, the thing that controls hormones in our bodies. You do know I have a degree in Biological Sciences, don&#39;t you Jason?&quot; Said Sarah, now more bothered about the percieved insult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry, it is just that, when you where around, all that you talked about was just sex, so I just took you for some bimbo.&quot; Jason says in an apologetic tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m nymphomaniac Jason, not dumb. But let&#39;s get back to what we where talking about. So, the Doc tried to arrange things in such a way that I could &#39;grow&#39; inside of your body to help hasten the process of recovery. He said it is best to work with extra material, so while I&#39;m inside of you, I&#39;m mostly overtaking more parts of your body with time, as a way to give him more stuff to work with when the procedure is finally viable. That is also why he changed your balls to produce estrogen, it would help the process work more easily.&quot; Said Sarah, trying to ignore the accidental offence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you mean, I&#39;m turning into you?&quot; Jason said, having picked only part of what Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, none of that, I&#39;m growing around and inside of you. It is like, I&#39;m like a lost limb grafted to a healthy bodypart to prevent it from dying while the surgery can be prepared.&quot; Said Sarah, realising that Jason would probably get it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, understood.&quot; Said Jason, getting most of the idea, even though he didn&#39;t grasp the whole picture yet. With that, he decides to muster up the courage and ask Sarah about what had just happened. &quot;So...aaaam...Sarah, what was that thing that happened just now when you where giving Mike the, you know, &#39;blowjob&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean the pleasure overflow?&quot; Replied Sarah, thinking she knows what Jason is about to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm...yeah&quot; Said Jason, in a disconcerted tone, trying not to admit he just had an orgasm while being fucked by another man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, so, you absorbed a lot of my nervous system, so your insides must be incredibly sensible to stimulus. The Doctor said that it was one of the reasons he removed our ability to generate waste from eating. He said it would make it easier, as he couldn&#39;t even imagine the amount of stimulus common bodily functions would cause.&quot; Sarah responded patiently, since she was curious herself about how much of that would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that explains a lot, but also, what about my nipples.&quot; Asked Jason, pointing at his chest, forgetting that Sarah couldn&#39;t see it from her position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nipples? What do you mean?&quot; Sarah asked, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when you started making me horny, my nipples started getting extremely sore and sensible, also, I felt a warmth inside of them. And they haven&#39;t stopped being puffy ever since then.&quot; Jason tries to explain, with an almost disconcerted tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, really? Huummmm...that must mean you are probably being more affected than I previously thought. This kind of sympton fits with the increase of estrogen on the body causing the development of boobs. And since you also absorbed my entire chest, it probably means that you will soon have big naturals to play with, hahahaha...&quot; Said Sarah, just imagining Jason with a huge ass and a killer rack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, it isn&#39;t funny, I&#39;m going to be a freak.&quot; Said Jason, in a tone that both upset and sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, remember, we will be living here until it is over, it isn&#39;t like you would be seeing too many people anyways with your ass flowing in the wind, so just go with the flow, it isn&#39;t like fixing it would be hard for the Doctor, considering what he has already done.&quot; Sarah tries to reassure him, knowing that he is easier to deal when he isn&#39;t upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...you are right. Like it isn&#39;t like anyone has to know about it.&quot; Said Jason, calming down again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wanna try something?&quot; Asked Sarah, in a playful tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Replied Jason.<br />
<br />
Sarah didn&#39;t respond, atleast, not with words. Jason could feel something changing inside of him, a familiar sensation. His cock got rock hard again, and he could feel his nipples engorging again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit Sarah, can&#39;t you get enough?&quot; Jason cried, upset at her never ending libido.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop complaining you crybaby. I wan&#39;t to test something. So, you said your nipples where sensible, didn&#39;t you? I will teach you some stuff about nipples.&quot; Sarah said, still playful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeer...alright, what do you want?&quot; Said Jason, accepting that Sarah is in control.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you know how you massage your cock head when you masturbate?&quot; Asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeer...yeah?&quot; Asked Jason, feeling disconcerted talking about masturbation to a woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, try something of the with your nipples, I&#39;m now curious about how that would work.&quot; Said Sarah, giving him instructions on how to do it.<br />
<br />
Jason decides to try it, and he feel a jolt of please from touching his nipples that he never felt before. If what Sarah said is true, he might be even more sensible than Sarah ever was. Sarah can feel it too and confirms with her commands.<br />
<br />
Jason and Sarah keep at that for 10 minutes, meaning all of the way, until Sarah has a thunderous orgasm, leaving Jason weak on the legs, having cummed more the he ever did any other time, resting on the side of the tub while leaving Sarah lifted under the shower, taking in the water.<br />
<br />
They soon recover, with Sarah now more curious than ever of the possibilities, and thinking of ways to convince Jason to join in on them. Jason is more curious about the fact that once again, his chest kept feeling fuller and his nipples larger. He might be having his big naturals sooner than he thought at this pace.</p>
