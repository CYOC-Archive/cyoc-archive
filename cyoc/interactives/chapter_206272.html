<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren now exited his home, quickly making his way towards Hannah&#39;s. Summer was over and he was now ready for his newest challenge. High school.<br />
<br />
For the 14 year old, he was both excited and nervous. This was high school after all,  he was moving onto a place where he would be surrounded by bigger, older students. He was in essence going to be a small fish in a big pond. Still, he had his friends.<br />
<br />
Looking across the street, Darren smiled as Robbie and Hannah now exited their homes. The trio lived close to the high school, meaning that Darren would now be walking to school. As the friends now met up, they immediately asked Darren about a topic that he believed would dominate their conversations for the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Yuriko have any information on Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren shook his head no. After defeating Evan and purging the darkness from his soul, Darren believed the threat of the Catalyst killer was over. Instead, Darren discovered that Evans spirit had vanished, Yuriko and the rest of the magical world unsure what had become of him. The only thing they could agree on was that their was a good chance he was still out there.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one knows for sure,&quot; Darren said softly. &quot;But Yuriko says not to worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the Normal,&quot; Robbie asked. Once more Darren shrugged. Ever since Morgan and Evan&#39;s failed attack the Normal had been surprisingly quiet. This was unsettling for everyone as they worried what the organizations next move would be. Perhaps though, whatever Fukushu had done would quell their activities. &quot;They&#39;ve been too quiet,&quot; Darren stated. &quot;I mean I&#39;m happy I&#39;m not fighting them day in and day out but I&#39;m worried about what their next move will be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you got this,&quot; Hannah smiled. &quot;I mean we&#39;ve kicked their ass before. Know we can do it again if we have too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren smirked, thanking the monkey gynoid as they now approached the high school grounds. The building was much larger than their middle school, looming over the teens. Darren wondered if this was intentional? A way of intimidating new students on their first day of school. Glancing over the parking lot and front lobby they could see students milling around as they exited their cars and buses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Crystals here,&quot; Robbie said excitedly. &quot;I&#39;ll catch up with you guys later!&quot; Hannah and Robbie nodded, watching their friend sprint towards his girlfriend as the pair went inside. Hannah and Darren now glanced at one another, taking a deep breath as they now made their way inside.<br />
<br />
As the school day started, Darren was rather disappointed to see class was very similar to what he had experienced before. Homeroom was underwhelming, the teacher taking attendance before announcements were made. Darren learning that the Freshman class would have orientation following homeroom in the auditorium. As the bell sounded announcing the end of homeroom, Darren now made his way to the auditorium quickly finding his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Darren stated as he eased himself into a chair. &quot;How are things so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I guess,&quot; Misaki shrugged, the teen now pulling out her schedule. &quot;What classes do you have after this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Biology, then Algebra, History,&quot; Darren said. Misaki&#39;s eyes lit up, a smile spreading across her face as she realized the pair would have some classes together. &quot;Me too,&quot; she replied happily. &quot;You want to sit next to eachother?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Darren could answer, the Freshman class was called to attention. Darren and Misaki now looked towards the stage, watching as the elderly principal now approached the microphone. &quot;Welcome Class of 2106,&quot; he croaked. &quot;My name is Principal Lucas, allow me to explain what is to be expected this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren leaned back in his chair, trying to be attentive to what the elderly principal was saying. Unfortunately it appeared Principal Lucas was quite tired, his voice seeming to drone. Within moments of the speech, Darren could notice students nodding off. &quot;Geez this guy is boring,&quot; Hannah whispered. Darren nodded in agreement, glancing at his rings as an idea began to form.<br />
<br />
Darren now stared at Principal Lucas, a smile forming on his face as his magic washed over the principal. Darren watched as the principal stopped talking, his body freezing in place. The teen watched the wrinkles in the old man&#39;s face begin to smooth, the weight around his midsection shifting into other parts of his body. The first part of the spell effectively turning the elderly principal into a solidly built man.<br />
<br />
Now Darren began the second part of his spell. The principals clothing vanishing.  Darren cringed slightly at the nude body of his principal before the spell sped forward. Principal Lucas&#39;s manhood now shrank away into nothing, his belly hutton becoming fainter until vanishing, as his flesh took on a plastic sheen. Principal Lucas was now a solidly built androgynous being with plastic skin. Still thought the changes continued.<br />
<br />
Darren watched as the body of his principal continued to mold itself. The principals legs becoming thicker, his chest becoming larger with a set of D cup breasts as his head now began to change. The teen watched as the head began to shape, a small muzzle sticking out as his ears moved to the top his head, rounding off. Darren nodded in approval as he gazed at the urine head of his newest Soul Drive.<br />
<br />
Placing the finishing touches on his bear Soul Drive, Darren watched as bright white fur now began to fill out the powerful body of Diamond, the bear Soul Drive. Diamonds hands became like miss, covered in a soft white fur. This fur now extended along her chassis, covering her torso as well as her massive paw like feet. As the changes concluded, Darren nodded in approval.<br />
<br />
Diamond was a powerfully built bear Soul Drive. The Soul Drives body was not as curvy as some of the previous models, instead looking like an Amazon with a powerful chassis, large bear like head and thick arms and legs. The eyes though were a clear sky blue. A blue that showed before compassion and ferocity, like any she polar bear. The snow white fur of the Soul Drive was also more conservative in its placement, appearing more like a sleeveless blouse with a Capri bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to getting to know each and everyone of you this year,&quot; Diamond stated, her voice both warm and authoritative. &quot;My office is always open if you have any questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren glanced at the Freshman class, a smile growing on his young face. Gone were the bored and apathetic faces that had occupied the auditorium. Now, the Freshman class was attentive, looking to their new principal with a type of reverence reserved for charismatic leaders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Diamond knocked that speech out of the park,&quot; Hannah whispered. &quot;Those public speaking files she downloaded really paid off.&quot; Darren could only grin at Hannah&#39;s response, maybe high school wouldn&#39;t be as intimidating as he thought.</p>
