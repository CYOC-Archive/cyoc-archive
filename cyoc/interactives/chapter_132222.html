<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The evening was getting colder; figures dressed in coats and jackets hurried to train stations and apartment buildings. A figure dressed in white walks down a side street, his black ponytail swings in the air as he hurriedly steps towards a small apartment complex. <br />
The automatic doors draw open in front of the man as another occupant of the building enters along side him “Hey Mr. Freize, cold out isn’t it?<br />
The man turns and shrugs off his white jacket and takes a moment to wipe the rain from his goatee “ive told you, please, just call me Freeze. Will you be coming out tonight?”<br />
“Maybe.... but it depends on whether or not Whitney is going to go along or not. I kind of feel like she&#39;s trying to target just me”.<br />
<br />
Freeze knew what he was talking about; Whitney had made a name for herself for being a prankster. Everything from dropping a potion or two in a drink, to turning people into breasts and sticking them to herself, in fact, that last prank had gained infamy to the point where there is now a themed night to see who can gain the most extra &#39;assets&#39;.<br />
Freeze smiled and said “Well if you decide to come or not, you know where to find me” And with that, Freeze made his way up to his apartment.<br />
<br />
Walking through the door, Freeze hung his jacket up onto his coat rack. And placed his groceries on the counter. Working at the Asylum paid well, especially his tips but his apartment said otherwise: a small couch on a rug the only thing adorning the lounge, a small pile of books covering one half, a testament to his bachelor lifestyle.<br />
Freeze was saving his money; he had quite a bit now, and was going to use it to open his own club, just like the Asylum. He loved his job, there was always an air of excitement in that place, even when it wasn’t open during the nights set up, the thrill of what was to come was all he needed.<br />
Freeze got his evening meal prepared, it was really basic stuff; a bowl of rice with some steamed vegetables, but he preferred it that way. <br />
Freeze sat on his couch and flipped through one of his books as ate his dinner, he was researching new concoctions to surprise his patrons, offering thrills as well as inebriation. Tonight he was planning on trial running a new recipe, and he couldn&#39;t wait to see the reception the product brought to the patrons.<br />
<br />
A small alarm clock began beeping on the counter to tell Freeze that it was time to get ready for work. Freeze made his way to his bathroom and clambered into the shower, the hot water feeling good as it ran down his back, his broad shoulders causing two smaller cascades of water down his chest and abdominals, running off the end of his member.<br />
After his scrub down, Freeze began to get dressed: black underwear which did its best to hide his package; he didn’t like drawing attention to it, but he was &#39;gifted&#39; as some of the ladies told him, and frankly he grew weary of it getting grabbed by those too had one too many drinks.<br />
Next he slipped into the bartender standard issue black slacks and white shirt; Freeze always put garters on his upper arms, its not like he needed to, but he loved the classic &#39;saloon bartender&#39; look.<br />
After sliding up his red suspenders and got his bow tie straightened, Freeze made his way to his closet, placing a red membership card against the wooden surface. With a slight glow the crack in the door began to also glow red before fading away.<br />
With a turn of the doorknob, Freeze opened the door, instead of just clothing there was an entryway to the Asylum.<br />
Freeze walked in through the opening, the door closing and with a flash- was gone altogether from the Asylum side.<br />
“Dapper as ever I see” a voice called across the room. Freeze turned around and saw the voices owner; Long legs ending in a very tight butt, which she loved showing off in her &#39;company issued&#39; black booty shorts. Her white work shirt tied up showing of her midriff and her perky breasts.<br />
“Wynd, good to see your in good spirits today” Freeze replied. Wynd flicked her shoulder length blonde hair away from her face. “why wouldn’t I be, this is the best job ever”.<br />
“Team meeting at the bar everyone” a voice boomed over the near empty room.<br />
“Well its time to get things moving” Freeze said, and the two made their way over to the bar.<br />
<br />
The bar of the Asylum was Freezes base of operations, to the average eye it looked like any other nightclub bar: stools in black against a red facade and black counter top, bar fridges filled with you standard beers and wines, a large pile of spirits adorning the back mirrored wall. Freeze knew however what was really stacked amongst those shelves too; smaller lab-like equipment was scattered in between it all, and some of those spirit bottles have more than just alcohol in it.<br />
Sitting at the stools were the staff of the Asylum, Wynd the door clerk sat next to the bouncer, who himself looked like a depiction of a Roman gladiator, if they wore black suits and glasses that is.<br />
The owner stood up and addressed everyone “Ok team, we open in one hour, time to get your stations set up, and if you want to get &#39;changed&#39; for tonight, now is the time. Freeze, see to any staff change requests”<br />
With that said Freeze walked behind his counter top, his first orders of the night getting the staff ready; The bouncer was given his usual shot glass, he downed the contents and looked down as a second set of arms grew out, slipping out of tailored holes in his suit jacket, this was his token change as it made his job all the more easier. Wynd, who worked the cloak room received her drink in a martini glass, to which she sipped with glee. Wynds change was quite rapid, her arms splitting between elbow and hand and then again, giving her a total of six arms, her legs also divided the same way, her spandex booty shorts now being forced to their absolute limit, Freeze understood the arms as it made her job easier, but when he asked about the legs last time, she simply grinned and said “who doesn’t love running hands up their thighs?”.<br />
One by one the staff became readied for their jobs and walked away; the last, DJ Fingers, morphing his head into a fully functional arm, his headphones taking a more symbolic place around the base of the new upper arm. Freeze now began making his own special mix, adding a dash of whiskey for flavour, before drinking it down. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, up along his forehead another four eyes slipped through the skin and as he exhaled, opened his original pair. People liked his look, and his light blue eyes got all the attention from patrons, so having more just meant better tips, plus he could keep an eye on his surroundings too.<br />
<br />
Time ticked on and as the clock passed 10pm, the doors opened. Patrons made their way through the coat check and into the main lobby of the club; some people, in their sheer excitement nearly ran to get into prospective theme rooms to begin their transformation hijinks. <br />
Freeze took the quieter part of the night, before things got really crazy, to get his new recipe set up. He had full run of the transformation cocktails he made at the bar, which compounded his willingness to get creative. Arcane glyphs and bubbling tubes glowed as he mixed and purified ingredients, the odd puff of smoke causing him to close his eyes out of surprise.<br />
<br />
Freezes first patron came by, he knew her well, she had been coming every Saturday for the last 4 months and always went straight to the bar when she arrived, making small talk whenever she stopped by. Her long hair flowed across her near naked form, her only clothing being a lacy green bra and panty set. <br />
“How&#39;s your week been Freeze?” the woman said seductively. “its been good, ive been writing new recipes and making plans for the new club set up”. Her eyes suddenly lit up “Oooohh I want to try it! Are you using a new one tonight?”. Freeze chuckled “Yeah I’m trialling one tonight, you can be the first to try if you want?”. The woman jumped up and down with joy “Yes please Mr. Barman!”.<br />
With that, Freeze poured his creation into a thin vial, topped it with a strawberry slice, and placed it in front of her. “Do you want to know what it does?” Freeze enquired. “Nah I want it to be a surprise, thats how I like it” and sliding a long straw into the glass, sipped it all down in one go.<br />
<br />
The woman began to hum to herself and held out a hand in front of herself, her body beginning to tingle. “ooh here we go!” she called out, and took a few steps back from the bar.<br />
The change had begun, and the woman&#39;s loud announcement had drawn the attention of the patrons as they flooded into the main lobby. Freeze liked this, as it helped to showcase his skills with beverage based transformation.<br />
The woman’s fingers seemed to lose definition as they receded into her hand; upon looking down, her toes had followed suit. Next her arms seemed to follow the same fate, drawing back into her as her height diminished from her slow loss of her legs. In only a minute she was down to a limbless body, laying on the floor. She lifted her head and asked Freeze “What, this is it? Limbless is pretty standard dude, nothing new abou-”. Suddenly her shoulders began pulling forward. The woman’s whole body began to curl, lurching her head forwards, her body continued to curl as her face neared her crotch.”Freeze you are the best!” she called out as she used her mouth to pull her panties out of the way, shaking slightly to wiggle out. With a sultry “tasty” she brought her lips up to her pussy, kissing it lightly.<br />
The forming crowd watched as her eyes went wide, looking down at her lips, they slowly began fusing to her pussy, drawing her face right into her nethers, and with a flowing ripple of skin, her face disappeared into her body. Her body began to shake slightly, before it continued to curl further, morphing into a ball of pale flesh, her bra snapping off from the pressure.<br />
<br />
The crowd watched the ball, for a moment there was no movement as Freeze began smiling; this was only the first part. The ball began to twitch, then more and more wildly. A split formed horizontally along the ball, the skin, turning red and curling outward, puffing up as it did so. By now the crowd could see what was happening; a giant mouth forming on the front of the ball, the mouth&#39;s edges curled up in a smile. The mouth was seeming to try to speak but was cut short by a bulging behind the lips, pressure building until in a sudden &#39;pop&#39; a massive tongue emerged in the shape of a woman, with all of the curves from hips to head. <br />
Features now began to form on the tongue, a large pair of breasts pushed forward and a divot appeared at the tongues base forming into a pussy. The head remained bald but a pair of eyes and lips appeared, the same as the face the woman possessed.<br />
 “y-y-you cheeky bastard” the tongue woman moaned, her body flailing around she she tried to gain control. “You arent done yet hunny” Freeze chuckled as two bumps appeared on the flesh ball. “I wasn’t going to change you this much without giving you the ability to move around”. As Freeze said that, the bumps extended into two arms, which shakily began to balance and moves around.<br />
<br />
“Whoa” The tongue woman shrieked, as she started to teeter, her tongue body flopping over and landing in the arms of another woman. “Oh my god, I can totally taste you through my body” The woman said, and leaned forward and kissed the startled woman in the lips before whispering “you’ve got to try this”. <br />
The crowd began applauding the tongue woman and Freeze, at least two dozen people hurrying over to order the same concoction from the happy bartender. In a matter of ten minutes there were flesh balls scattered all throughout the main lobby, tongue bodies hugging and rubbing each other in sensuous overload.<br />
The tongue woman made her way back to the bar. “Freeze, you did it this time, its a huge hit!”. “always good to see a satisfied customer” Freeze jokingly replied. <br />
The tongue woman then grabbed hold of Freezes face with both of her tongue hands, lightly coating his face in moisture “I’m totally going to bring my friend here next week, I think she&#39;ll love it” Freeze placed his hand over one of hers caressing his face and said “I cant wait....by the way, Whitney is standing behind you with a devious look on her face”. With an almost equal devious look the tongue woman turned around and made her way towards the infamous Whitney “see you late Mr. Bartender”. Freeze smiled as he served up another drink and said “See you next week, Skye”.</p>
