<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I started following the coaches I stopped in my tracks. I just had a nice idea of how to be able to enjoy my time in the lockers.<br />
<br />
Taking out the book I quickly jotted down as I went back to my original seat: &quot;The hornier someone makes me, in the locker room, the bigger they get, when I cum the growth is mantained until they return to it. And everyone on the team knows it.&quot; Now not only they had a reason to want me to be here, they had a reason to make me enjoy it.<br />
<br />
A few moments passed after I finished writing it where nothing happened. I was starting to doubt it had worked when Scotty came back into my field of vision. &quot;Hey, faggot.&quot; He said with a stern tone that made me instantaneously blush. D-did, did I like this? Scotty smiled as he felt his muscles pulsate bigger. &quot;Yeah, time for the show. Look at this.&quot; And he flexed his powerful biceps.<br />
<br />
His beautiful, simmetrical, covered in a healthy amount of fat, biceps. Scotty grunted as he felt his muscles all over his body clench and grow slightly a few times as I stared, mesmerized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scot, not fair, don&#39;t start before everyone else joins in!&quot; Said another guy, who quickly called everyone else. Guys who were still taking off their clothes rushed to make it in time. I felt all their eyes on me and along with the reasonable feeling of intimidation I felt... Horny...<br />
<br />
They all grunted as their muscles pumped and grew slightly. &quot;Oh yeah, Ethan&#39;s little fag loves to be the center of attention doesn&#39;t he.&quot; One of the bigger guys said with a deep baritone. Memories flooded my mind of the many times this had happened before. The way they berated him and made him feel both ashamed and so, so horny.<br />
<br />
Many of them were flexing their growing muscles now. All of them were growing steadily just from being there, but whoever caught my attention grew ever so slightly faster, their grunts ever so slightly more drawn out as their pecs bounced wider and their butts clenched and bubbled out. I could tell they enjoyed it just as much as I did, if not even more. <br />
<br />
I palmed my dick through my pants as it hardened only to get it slapped away by Scotty. &quot;You know you&#39;re not allowed to touch yourself, slut. Look at me.&quot; He said in a deeper tenor than his usual. I looked up in time to see his pecs swell up and his neck thickening. &quot;Just do what you do best and sit back and enjoy the show. As he bounced his pecs provocatively I remembered the rules of this: They had to put on at least 50 pounds of muscle before I could finish myself off. How did I know they had gotten to that point? Well it was pretty easy actually.<br />
<br />
Behind Scotty I could see things were getting steamier. The few guys that had kept their undies now had tents in them, while the nude ones were sporting their hard ons openly. Funnily enough their cocks didn&#39;t seem to be growing along with their bodies, but that didn&#39;t make them less mouthwatering even as they got overshadowed by bulging quads. <br />
<br />
As for their widening hands: the guys that weren&#39;t openly touching and squeezing their growing mass were doing so to their friend&#39;s growing bodies. Scotty&#39;s moan brought my attention to him as he tugged on his nipples in time with the little spurts that were making his pecs bulge further away from his torso.<br />
<br />
Ethan tried to keep silent as he jerked his own cock off to the side, just close enough for him to enjoy the effects of Kevin&#39;s powers. He felt weird objectifying himself for his gay friend&#39;s gaze. But he couldn&#39;t deny just how good it felt to grow. He moaned as his butt clenched hard, his forearms filling up, his growth speeding up suddenly. He had to let go of his dick in an attempt to not cum. He looked around and saw it, Kevin had found him and was staring straight at him, even as Scotty gave him a full blown lapdance. Ethan could feel his dick getting closer and closer to popping off even as his thickening mitts gripped the lockers behind him tightly.<br />
<br />
My hips bucked involuntarily as I heard Ethan&#39;s long bass moan and saw the thick white ropes spurt from his dick. Turning my eyes to Scotty, as the man was almost rubbing his dick on my face at this point, I saw him stop suddenly as his growth picked up suddenly as well. He pulled tightly on his pink pert nipples as he expanded twice before cumming all over my face and hair.<br />
<br />
Behind him one after another the other players came as their growth was accelerated by my overlusted gaze. Some of them stopped touching their dicks and just let it come, while others jerked even harder. Some weren&#39;t even jerking -themselves-. That was the point where they had reached 1.5x their original bodymass. Those that came actually kept growing -- and coming -- , they&#39;d only stop if I stopped feeling horny -- which was unlikely -- or if I came. <br />
<br />
I could only see Ethan&#39;s legs on the floor from where I stood now, as they writhed in orgasmic pleasure. Scotty&#39;s knees had given out a few seconds ago and he was now shooting blanks as his body kept growing past the mandatory mark. As I grabbed my own dick and started jerking I could hear a sigh of relative relief coming from him, amidst all the moaning going on all around me.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take very long at all to bring myself to an orgasm, with all the visual stimulation. And as soon as I came the male sex vocalizations around me quickly died down as the last growth contractions ended and their bodies stabilized. <br />
<br />
The previously athletic and slim team now looked like amateur bodybuilders, most having gained about 60-80 pounds of new muscle. As everyone slowly got up and went to clean themselves off the Coaches returned and coordinated the last few bits so they could make the best out of the remaining practice time.<br />
<br />
When Ethan came out from his hiding place my jaw dropped, he looked massive before, but now he would likely have trouble fitting through most doors. Oopsies. As he wobbled in the direction of the coaches I quickly wrote down &quot;The extra muscle does not hinder the movement of those grown by the statement above&quot; and immediately Ethan&#39;s waddles became more stable, and he easily was able to put on his uniform and get to the field.<br />
<br />
Soon only I was left at the locker room, still recovering from the earlier exertion. What should I do next?</p>
