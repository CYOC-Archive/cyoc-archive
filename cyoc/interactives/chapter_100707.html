<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Side chapter that kinda ties into &quot;The Fugitive&quot; chapter. I know I wrote that there were FBI in Moon Lake in previous chapters, but it&#39;s actually US Marshals who handle fugitives and prisoner transport. A minor change, but still a change. - bj88<br />
<br />
Having departed the Lawson&#39;s home, Samantha Twist was preparing for yet another day of mediating the arguments between the mayor’s office, and the unwelcome US Marshals agents. Since their arrival, she’d been keeping a bottle of Aspirin in her desk drawer. And it pained her to see it was almost empty. <br />
<br />
She strode across the hallway and into the mayor’s office, currently occupied by Brendon Unger, a city councilman and werecougar, an uncommon male werecat species. Samantha was glad he was the acting mayor, and she hoped one day he might run. <br />
<br />
Brendon was young, but Moon Lake and normal standards at only forty six. Martin had been the mayor for about twenty-seven years. The longest tenure of any mayor had been Martin’s predecessor, who held the office about one hundred and sixty-two years before finally retiring. <br />
<br />
“Sam, thanks for coming.” Brendon says, motioning for Samantha to sit adjacent to him at a long table. <br />
<br />
“Like I had a choice,” Samantha says, only a bit sarcastic.<br />
<br />
“All the same, I’m glad to have someone with a level head in the room.”<br />
<br />
“Where are our guests of honor?” Samantha asks. One could tell when the US Marshal agents were present. Normals don’t make an effort to keep their voices down, so everyone who is a were at city hall could hear them talking. There was a stark quiet in the building at the moment. <br />
<br />
“Running late. They got a tip about their fugitive, and went to see if it turned anything up. With any luck, they’ll catch the guy and be out of our hair.” Brendon sighed.<br />
<br />
“When did they get the tip?”<br />
<br />
“No idea, I only found out because I turned the news on earlier. They’re still not being very generous with information.” Brendon says sourly. <br />
<br />
“We can’t force them to talk, we’re not the police in this matter.” Samantha reminds him. Brendon’s been under the impression that since the US Marshal have all but thrown them into interrogation rooms, they should be grilling the agents on the same token. But after living with Francis, Samantha knows that hostility won’t earn them an points, nor will it solver any problems between the two parties. <br />
<br />
“I need a change of subject, how did the welcoming of that new family go? They’re all weres so I imagine it was pretty easy.” Brendon says. <br />
<br />
“Very. Actually I wet to school with Maggie Lawson. She and her sister used to live here with their parents. And some of their extended family too. A cousin of theirs still lives here with his daughter.” Samantha said. <br />
<br />
“Small world. Most of my class is still around. A few brave soul left for greener pastures” Brendon says longingly.<br />
<br />
“Having second thoughts on your career Brendon?”<br />
<br />
“No, more about whether I should have stayed or gone. I mean, you’ve lived here your entire life, don’t you ever wonder what the outside world is like?”<br />
<br />
“I used to, maybe I still do. But things are never the way we imagine them to be. Best not to peek behind the curtain.” Sam said. She meant only half of what she said. She really did wonder if staying in Moon Lake was the right choice. Maggie had struck out on her own and made a great life for herself. Granted she did come back, but after several decades. <br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t have met Francis, you wouldn’t have Ben. Things are fine the way they are,” she thinks to herself. Now if only she could convince herself those were good enough reasons to stop contemplating another life. <br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity (actually about an hour), the US Marshal agents finally show their faces. The three usual agents enter the office. Agent Bryan Johnson, the lead agent, is an older gentleman with salt and pepper hair. About half his age, Agent Sean Walker, looked like he should still be in high school, or college. He was very slim, and had messy dark brown hair. Which was in contrast to the very small, just missing five feet by an inch or two, Agent Brooke Reed. She had blonde hair that cascaded down to her shoulder blades, and a twenty carat smile. <br />
<br />
“Sorry we’re late.” Agent Johnson said.<br />
<br />
“If you were worry you would have called. Or at least told us about the tip you got.” Brendon said flatly. <br />
<br />
“Fair enough.” Johnson concedes. <br />
<br />
“Did the tip turn up any new leads?” Samantha asked, her fingers crossed. <br />
<br />
“Nothing credible at the moment. We’re still looking into it.” Agent Walker said mechanically. Brendon gave him a dirty look before addressing Agent Johnson again. <br />
<br />
“So, where were we? Ah, I believe the last time we spoke your Agent Walker called me…”<br />
<br />
“Please, Mr. Unger there’s no need to relive that.” Agent Johnson said quickly. To his right, Walker looked like he wanted to say something. Agent Reed put a hand on his arm and convinced him to keep quiet for the meantime.<br />
<br />
“We understand your frustration, but the fact of the matter is we can’t discuss the case with you, not in depth. We can give you information as it presents itself, so long as it’s not sensitive or…”<br />
<br />
“Or something you don’t want us to know.” Brendon interjects. <br />
<br />
“Oh god, here we go.” Samantha thinks as Agent Walker leaps from his seat.<br />
<br />
“That’s a little unfair don’t you think? You’re not in a position to point fingers. You’ve been keeping our agents corralled to one area of the town. Why? What do you have to hide?” Walker demands.<br />
<br />
“Walker get your ass back in that chair!” Johnson snaps. Agent Walker reluctantly sits back down, he and Brendon exchanging fierce glares the entire time. <br />
<br />
“Look, Mr. Unger, Ms. Twist, this arrangement isn’t going to get any worse or any better until we all agree to stop fighting with each other. We’re willing to put our cards on the table, but only if you cooperate. While Agent Walker was completely out of line in his outburst, he does have a valid point. Out agents are here to investigate and protect. Yet you keep them barred to one section of your town. Why is that?” <br />
<br />
“You think people want the feds nosing around in their backyards and trash? This is a violation of privacy! You’re here on nothing but a hunch! And some other reason you won’t share with us. We haven’t told anyone there are US Marshal agents in town, do you know what kind of panic that would cause?” Brendon said, balling his fists. <br />
<br />
“Why would that cause a panic?” Agent Reed asked. <br />
<br />
“I’m sure most of the state has been following your nam-hunt. It doesn’t take a genius to put two and two together.” Brendon says. <br />
<br />
“Our agents will be discreet, you have my word on that.”<br />
<br />
“Why should we let them stay? You have no warrant, no grounds to stay except that you’re here in case this prisoner comes our way. And even then, why would he come here of all places? I was under t he impression he’d been hiding in the southern portion of the state, and northern Oregon.” Samantha asked. <br />
<br />
“We believe he’s heading north, perhaps towards Canada.” Reed says.<br />
<br />
“Well why did he need to come all the way out here to do so?” <br />
<br />
“Unknown at the moment. Maybe he has resources out here.” Reed shrugs.</p>
