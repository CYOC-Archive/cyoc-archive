<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sometime during the night, the four foot nothing raptor woman stirred and felt the presense of Ty buzzing about in her mind.<br />
<br />
((You&#39;re awake! Finally!)) Ty echoed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Juno murmured, cuddling into Ty&#39;s blankets.<br />
<br />
((I need out of you...)) He said in a panicked tone. ((Please give me my body back.))<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh.&quot; The raptor smiled. &quot;Feeling a little cooped up?&quot;<br />
<br />
((Yes! Please!))<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well!&quot; The raptor sat up, heavy tits swaying, and stretched out to yawn. She looked down at her belly, checked the bedside clock, and snorted. &quot;Do you have any idea what time it is, love?&quot;<br />
<br />
((Ah, no!)) Ty said testily. ((Because not only do I not have eyes, I have no perceptions to speak of. So no, I can&#39;t tell what time it is.))<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to be short.&quot; Juno giggled. &quot;Just relax. Calm down. Let&#39;s begin your... extraction.&quot;<br />
<br />
((Ahhh.)) Ty exhaled in relief, or at least approximated it. ((Thank you.))<br />
<br />
Juno concentrated, feeling her own power flaring, and with a sly smile she felt Ty start to concentrate within her... trailing down from her mind... through her body...<br />
<br />
((Wait, this wasnt what you were going to do at all!)) Ty gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine.&quot; She smirked. &quot;Let me have my fun with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
((J-Juno! Wait!)) Then silence.<br />
<br />
The dinosaur woman patted her stomach gently and stroked it. Somewhere, deep in her womb, an impossibly fertilized egg embedded itself in her uterine wall and began to slowly but surely grow. The raptoress lied back down, biting the edge of her scaly lip, and kept rubbing her stomach. Her master and lover was growing inside of her right now. Slowly. Gently. Painlessly.<br />
<br />
She was too excited to fall back to sleep. Her hand wandered lower. She felt something stir inside of her. A flutter. With wide eyes she looked down to her belly in shock. No outward change... yet. Still, she was such a slutty horny reptile. She began stroking her clit with the smooth side of her claw. He was growing inside of her. She started to feel strange and raised the covers. She blinked when she realized she was a little swollen now. Her tight stomach had stretched out. Just a little. With a gasp, she realized she could feel him growing inside of her.<br />
<br />
It was the most erotic thing in the world. She pressed on with her masturbation, feeling the growth, the movement inside of her, and her own body starting to change. It stirred her to hot slickness. She gasped as she found she had to reach a little more past her swelling stomach. She realized her breasts felt heavier... she gripped one and was startled as she felt it was swelling too. Under her hand, her bust was growing bigger, heavier... laden with milk. Not absurdly, but she was set to gain a little more size to her tits.<br />
<br />
She sat up in the bed, braced her back on Ty&#39;s headboard, and kept playing with herself. She could feel her human master growing big and heavy within her. She felt him stir every once in a while, all cooped up and warm inside of her womb. Suddenly, she started to swell quite dramatically, her hips growing rounder, her belly protruding. She touched it, pressed it, and was startled as Ty responded, a tiny hand pressing back. She held a life inside of her that was much more intimate than just a mere mind. She felt a sudden pang, a gripping contraction, and gasped.<br />
<br />
She paused it. She didn&#39;t want to give birth right then and there. Wobbling slightly, the startled Juno rose from the bed. Her back hurt and she felt doughy from the extra baby weight. Her breasts were big and tight, her belly was firm and round, and parts of her had filled out during the onset pregnancy. Her ass was rounder, her hips were wider. She rubbed a hand over herself in the dark. Experimentally, she gripped one of her tits and gasped as a dribble of milk erupted from her nipple and trickled out from her feathers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!&quot; She blinked several times. &quot;Mammals are so fucked!&quot;<br />
<br />
She had to see it. She walked from Ty&#39;s room to the bathroom, closed and locked the door, and turned on the light. In full illumination she was startled by the sight of herself. She had plumped all over, her body soft, pudgy, and rounded. Even under her snout where her neck met her chin, there was a little pocket of weight. She rubbed her hands over herself, feeling her jiggly goodness, and rubbed her tummy again.<br />
<br />
This was so strange. The dinosaur was taken aback.<br />
<br />
Well, she had started it, hadn&#39;t she? Might as well finish it.<br />
<br />
Or... no.<br />
<br />
She looked over herself, concentrated, and watched it start to reverse. She began to lose weight, tighten, and her belly began to deflate. In moments Ty was unmade again and Juno was back her normal sinewey self.<br />
<br />
Hmmm. Now what? She concentrated again, and let the pregnancy advance a second time. Slowly. She watched in the mirror for a long time as she inflated, swelled, and progressed through the process. This time, it was much more thrilling. She stood with her back against the wall, panting, and masturbated, occasionally looking up in the mirror to see her progress. There was the sudden pang again, but she let it proceed. She slid down the wall and whimpered as the contractions started. Ty began to stir inside of her.<br />
<br />
The raptor felt her vaginal walls beginning to stretch with each contraction. She grabbed her snout and held it to keep herself from screaming. The pain. The pressure. The sensations. They were agonizing! She began to moan roughly, twisting this way and that, and suddenly looked down in mortified terror as she felt a sopping wetness from her pussy. Had... had she peed herself?<br />
<br />
In shock, she realized her water had broke. Distant memories of June told her what was happening. She relaxed slightly, and then the pain began to rise to almost unbearable levels. She was so mentally flustered she couldn&#39;t concentrate enough to will or wish anything. She was helpless as she went through accelerated labor, throwing her head back, grunting, snarling, crying out once or twice. She was a tough little dinosaur. Just when it felt like it was too much... she felt it. The urge to push.<br />
<br />
Spreading her legs, cursing, Juno grabbing at the floor and bit down. She began to push, the burning agony of child birth rising to its peak, and watched in fascination and disgust as something began to emerge from inside of her.</p>
