<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just outside his office, he had a sudden thought and wrote in his notebook, &quot;No-one outside my office will notice any sounds from inside it from people I have changed.&quot; He didn't want the shouting he was fairly sure was going to happen shortly to attract attention. Putting the notebook away he opened the door and went in, closing it behind him. Bob was standing on the other side of the room looking at a painting on the wall, his deer's tail twitching from side to side occasionally.<br />
<br />
When he heard the door close, he turned around, his udder swaying, and looked at Dave. Dave stared back, then sat behind his desk. &quot;Bob, I don't want to hear you making comments like that to Jenny again, it's rude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob looked slightly sheepish. &quot;I can't help it. She's got fantastic breasts, you know full well. Seeing them all wobbling around like that, on display... God, it turns me on.&quot; Dave gave him a hard look, and he wilted a little. &quot;OK, I'll tone it down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling slightly, Dave added, &quot;After all, technically you have even bigger breasts than she does, you know.&quot; At Bob's somewhat puzzled look, he elaborated, &quot;Your udder? You know it's a mammary gland, as are breasts? Look at the size of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob suddenly got a very strange expression on his face, and slowly looked down at himself. &quot;Oh my god! What the fuck happened to me, Dave?&quot; He reached down and felt his furry deer chest below his suit jacket with trembling hands, and turned his head to peer over his shoulder at the rest of his body. Trying to take a step forward, both front legs swung out in front of him and he froze again, staring at the polished wood. Bending slightly and reaching down he ran his hands over the smooth surface, at the same time feeling a slick hard surface under his fingers and his fingers on the legs.<br />
<br />
His udder swung around under him at the sudden movement, and he shuddered at the feeling. &quot;What the FUCK happened to me!?&quot;, he yelled. Dave was watching him with a smile, and Bob became angry. Trying again to walk forward, and turn to face Dave more squarely at the same time, he somehow stumbled when his legs didn't move the way he expected them to and tilted to the side, his swinging udder pulling him off balance. Waving his arms, he tipped over onto his side with a thud, and lay there with the wind knocked out of him for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Dave and Bob both realized at the same time that in this position he couldn't get back onto his feet by himself. Without being able to bend his legs he was stuck on his side unless someone put him back onto all four feet. Twisting his human torso a little more upright, Bob managed to look around at his lower body and inspect it some more. He reached back and down and felt his huge udder which was lying splayed out on the carpet, shuddering at the feeling. It was very sensitive to touch, in a way that stirred unwelcome erotic feelings.<br />
<br />
Looking at his wooden legs, he once more tried moving them and yelled in fury when he couldn't do much more than wave them back and forth. &quot;Help me, you bastard! What the hell is going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave smiled at him and said, &quot;Well, I think you might need to be milked, for a start. Your udder looks pretty full to me.&quot; Bob glared at him in fury, which turned to near hate when Dave walked over, knelt down, and patted the unwanted mammary. Ripples of motion sloshed back and forth across it, and he groaned in arousal and anger.<br />
<br />
Gently holding a large nipple in his hand, Dave experimentally pulled on it to see what would happen. Bob yelled &quot;Let go of me you fuck!&quot; Stepping back and standing up, Dave looked at his watch and then back at Bob. Any second now...<br />
<br />
Gradually, an odd expression moved across Bob's face, and he calmed down quickly. Shaking his head, he looked around, then up at Dave. &quot;Um, what were we talking about?&quot; he mumbled. Then, realizing his position, he added, &quot;Can you help me up? I have no idea why I'm lying on the floor.&quot; Dave smiled and reached down, levering the strange deer/cow/table form of his coworker to all four feet.<br />
<br />
Stuck by a thought once more he pulled out the notebook and added a short sentence to the end of Bob's page. Putting it away he bent down and grabbed hold of a couple of nipples, pulling them a few times until milk spurted out and Bob groaned in pleasure. As he did, all four legs moved slightly outward stabilizing him, then locked in place. Dave had changed him so that when milked his legs would lock like this, and stay locked until five minutes after the milking stopped.<br />
<br />
A quickly scribbled note later, and the milk soaking into the carpet had vanished, and Bob was connected to a small milking machine on wheels next to him. Dave stepped back and said, &quot;Hey, Bob, does being milked feel nice?&quot; Bob nodded, then froze once more.<br />
<br />
Again, he looked down at himself. &quot;What in god's name is going on? All of a sudden I just forgot that I was different.&quot; Looking up at Dave who was openly laughing at him by now he tried to walk closer so he could take a swing at him, and swore when he couldn't move. His attempts merely made his new udder wobble around massively, pulling painfully on the nipples as the machine kept sucking him dry.<br />
<br />
Frantically trying to make himself move, he was nearly in tears by this point, from both anger and the erotic sensations running through him. Dave disconnected the machine and moved it to one side, then said, &quot;Why don't you just forget about it, Bob?&quot;<br />
<br />
Once more a slightly puzzled expression came across his face. He tried to step forward, and when he couldn't, asked &quot;Did I just get milked? I'm having a really weird day.&quot; Dave nodded, and went back to his desk, sitting down comfortably. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, are we agreed that you'll be more polite to the women in the office? ESPECIALLY the more developed ones?&quot; Bob nodded absently, wondering why his memory of being milked was so hazy. Dave busied himself with some paperwork for a while (using an ordinary pen, of course),and a few minutes later Bob was able to move once more. Bidding goodbye to Dave, he turned and clomped across the the floor, leaving the office but still with a slightly bemused expression on his face. As soon as the door shut behind him Dave burst into laughter.<br />
<br />
When he calmed down, he wondered what he should try next.</p>
