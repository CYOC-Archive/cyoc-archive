<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gleb only had a moment to think while the raiders we&#39;re stunned, and he felt oddly comfortable in his newfound body, but the glint of light off his case of vials caught his attention. He quickly lowered himself to the case, closed it, and gingerly grabbed it as best he could with his new buggy limbs, then flew away as quick as he could from the raiders. Finally gathering their wits, they fired at him but he was too far and too deep in the forest undergrowth to make any meaningful shots.<br />
<br />
After what felt like a lifetime or a few minutes, Gleb wasn&#39;t sure, he decided to stop and perch on ground, holding the case carefully with one pair of limbs. He didn&#39;t stop because he was tired like before, but more to actually THINK about what to do, including just going in a direction could get him loss... or further away from any known landmarks. He was a town doctor, not a hunter, but getting more loss would just make things worse with this planet&#39;s flora and fauna. And speaking of fauna, he decided to take in his new form.<br />
<br />
A giant mosquito was the best way of describing himself, especially with the size, but he knew he was more than that. He was a prime specimen, biggest among his species and some genetic alterations for fighting and survival. Besides better efficiency with hunger and thirst, he also boosted the mosquito&#39;s natural regenerative ability and helped with its exoskeleton. The mosquito wasn&#39;t exactly a brawler in animal kingdom terms, so he tried his best to shore up its defenses. Besides Darwinian cheating, the mosquito was also somewhat more monstrous in appearance then its common Earth counterparts.<br />
<br />
He was also GIANT if that wasn&#39;t emphasized enough. He wasn&#39;t paying attention when he ran from the raiders, but the case of vials that could easily take up his lap as a human now felt more like a hand-sized, puzzle cube toy in his top pair of limbs. He is suppose to be one of the more apex predators of this planet, but taking that in was very alien.<br />
<br />
Speaking of alien. His body, his SENSES were completely new. After enough experimentation, he did put in a trait for &quot;normalizing&quot; so he wouldn&#39;t stumble around like a newborn, but taking time to think about his body finally brought in all the strangeness. <br />
<br />
He had 3 pairs of legs and were currently standing on the bottom two, perfectly balanced while still holding the case. It was effortless to set the case down while he took in more of his body. His mosquito head lacked the range of motion his human one had, only capable of turning, but his sight more than made up for that. He moved his wings a bit, more for showing motion, and then short bits of flight and hovering in place. He then played with his limbs for a bit. All his legs were much more articulate then his human ones, although their sharp and hooked ends wouldn&#39;t make them good for any subtle use. As before, he thanked he was so comfortable in his body that he was able to hold the case nicely. To finish things off, he made movements with his whole body. To an outsider, it might look like the mosquito was trying to dance, which wasn&#39;t far off from the truth, but for Gleb it solidified the trust he had in operating his body until he could sort out more details.<br />
<br />
If his body was exotic, Gleb&#39;s senses were truly alien. He had almost 360 degree sight, and unlike his earth counterparts, felt like he had eyes of an eagle... well a bunch of eagle-eyed cameras with a zoom function. Colors were just as vibrant as before, and it was odd being able to see many things at once. If there was a draw back, it was that he had trouble &quot;focusing&quot; on a single thing, like just looking at one camera rather then all of them. He also felt overwhelmed if a bunch of things were moving at once, like all the plants moving from a breeze. This was an issue if he wasn&#39;t use to it like everything else already, but he moved on with his other senses.<br />
<br />
His smell stood out next. He didn&#39;t have a nose to actively sniff with, but somehow his buggy antenna translated his sense to his hopefully human brain. His smell felt refined, although he couldn&#39;t really tell to what degree yet. What stood out was something out there smelled VERY appealing, akin to food being cooked in a kitchen. If Gleb&#39;s knowledge on the mosquito was correct, they were very good at detecting exposed blood, and with the aggressiveness of the local fauna, there was plenty to be had.<br />
<br />
His hearing and touch senses were lacking. As before, these were more specialized animals, and he was especially thankful to have any hearing at all. Both of them felt muted. His hearing felt as if he could be next to an explosion but muffled safely, but hearing the plants move in the wind was an endeavor. His touch felt like he was wearing a hard 2nd skin, although the first skin didn&#39;t exist in the first place. He wandered if this applied to his insides, but he would get to that later. He didn&#39;t want to play with his taste just yet, he played with his proboscis a bit more but wasn&#39;t in the mood to try &quot;tasting&quot; anything, especially when poisonous flora was a thing. <br />
<br />
He wanted to take in his body more, but Gleb decided on what to do next...</p>
