<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up the next morning to the sound of his phone, the 6:30 alarm ringing in yet another school day. After the unusually pleasant experiences yesterday (save for the rope and the laps), Jeff was feeling as though he could take on the world with a smile, let alone a crotch-breast.<br />
<br />
Curious and with a pang of excitement, he checked the Chronivac: according to the timer, there was just about three hours left. Unfortunately, he wouldn’t be able to switch himself back until after school, and he knew his mother wouldn’t let him stay at home “sick” after he had appeared so healthy and active yesterday. No matter, he thought. Today would mostly be classes that only required sitting at a desk and listening. The physical excursions of gym and the showers were Monday’s problems, and as far as he was concerned, he would be willing to delay another day before changing back- .... wait, what?<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head, correcting himself, though a small part of him knew what he meant. It was the same part that was unconsciously rubbing the breast with his left hand, idly drumming his fingers on it as though it had been there for years.<br />
<br />
Though slightly shocked with his act, Jeff didn&#39;t stop it, and instead smirked as he reached for the glass from last night&#39;s milking. If today was going to be the last day, he thought, the few waning minutes of total privacy he had this morning before school might as well be spent on a likable pastime. One that the fatty protrusion had given him plenty of enjoyment during, over the past few days.<br />
<br />
Cupping the glass against the breast, Jeff slowly but surely stroked it, breathing a satisfied sigh at the familiar welcoming barrage of pleasure hit him. He had only just started and already, it was feeling so good. Fantasizing about the breast in the shower yesterday, slick, soapy, and shining with glistening water, Jeff felt the body part stiffen and quiver in his hand, building up with milk. He smiled, shutting his eyes and continuing the fantasy.<br />
<br />
Jeff spent the entire session thinking about the breast: soft, firm, smooth, bouncy, squishy. It was everything he had ever thought a breast would feel like, and best of all it was his and his alone. He was free to touch it and wash it and tweak it... and grope it... and... and...<br />
<br />
With a forceful shudder, gritting his teeth to keep from moaning, Jeff emptied his contents into the glass, a beverage made for him, by him, in celebration of a job well done. Lifting the glass up to his mouth with both hands (he needed the extra strength, it felt like),  he took deep and gluttonous gulps, trying to pinpoint exactly what the taste was like...<br />
<br />
Jeff detected obvious hints of cream, but also sugar and a tangy tartness that kept it from being too sweet or too bitter. It was a perfect blend; like a vanilla milkshake with sea salt thrown in, plus a splash of nutmeg and cinnamon. It was unlike anything he had before, and yet still such a natural flavor. The texture, too, was so thick and mild. Remnants of the liquid stuck to the sides of the glass as Jeff haphazardly lolled his tongue around it, trying to get every little drop.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... hadn’t he decided last night that would be his last milking, though? Well, maybe, but... it just felt too good. It was considerably easier and more dynamic that playing with his penis, and it was far simpler to either make it last very long or go very quickly, the breast able to hold off release until he wanted to. He felt the warmth of the milk trickling down his throat and pooling in his stomach, heating his core. It was also much easier to clean up than semen, and much more fun. And, what’s more, it-<br />
<br />
Jeff shook himself awake, lowering the glass and stuffing the breast away. He shouldn’t be thinking like that! This was the last day of this... er, nightmare, yes. That was what this whole experience had been. No matter what he might have thought before this moment or however many good things had come out of the breast, both in terms of milk and situations, he had to keep in mind he was getting his penis back. After school let out and he got home, he was going to be fixed!<br />
<br />
Not wanting to chance anything, Jeff hid the Chronivac away safely without unplugging it, making sure the countdown continued on uninterrupted.<br />
<br />
Same as the day before, Jeff ate an uneventful breakfast before taking part in an utterly ordinary commute to school, save of course for the obvious exception. First period, which was a good omen for the rest of the day’s classes, was math. As Jeff had anticipated, much of it - in fact, ALL of it - consisted of sitting in place while taking notes. Fortunately, his desk was seated in the far back, away from any prying eyes. As was the case with yesterday, his inability to stick out worked wonders in terms of going below everyone’s radar.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until he transitioned between math and biology that Jeff experienced anything peculiar. Not bad, per se, but.....<br />
<br />
It happened as he was walking down the hall; he was busy trying to focus his mind on what the homework had been for the next class- biology, right? Of course it was biology, he didn’t have any other classes in this part of the school. Or maybe he thought it was a Thursday by accident? No, wait, that didn’t-<br />
<br />
WHAM<br />
<br />
An obnoxious and indescribable pain struck Jeff in the balls, or at least where they would have been if they were on his person. It was hurtful, but nothing excruciating. More like a medium-strength punch to the forearm than a burning agony that swept his entire body and made him want to vomit. The breast had absorbed some kind of impact, and was taking it far better than his “boys” ever could have.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down, and saw a freshman boy staring apologetically up at him, his locker opened directly in Jeff’s no-no zone, looking as though he had just run over Jeff’s pet. Some things were just instantly understood between men, with no explanation needed.<br />
<br />
“OH SHIT! I&#39;m SO sorry! I didn’t- PLEASE don’t be mad, man!”, the freshman babbled, all but in the verge of crying. Jeff frowned, hurt far more by the fact that this kid no doubt thought he was going to be beaten up than he was by the would-be nut buster. He opened his mouth to speak, but a thought dawned on him. As if severely injured, he clutched his groin tightly, doing his damnedest not to reveal the outline of the breast. It was risky, but necessary if he didn’t want his cover blown.<br />
<br />
“Urggh... it’s... f-fine”, Jeff groaned through fake gritted teeth, thinking back on the park&#39;s misery to draw inspiration for his faux agony. He had to sell it, not too much, not too little.<br />
<br />
Without another word, Jeff crept off, still acting as though he had just received a blow to the good and plenty’s. A few nearby students noticed and chuckled at his misfortune, while most others ignored him outright, but Jeff wasn’t concerned with either. Instead, he had some reflecting to do.<br />
<br />
What would that have been like if his testicles were where they were supposed to be? How much worse than a dull ache would it have been, if he had actually sustained that locker punt to the jewels? The thought alone sent shivers down Jeff’s spine, which in turn made the breast tremble in a series of quick, quaking wobbles.<br />
<br />
As he sat through biology, Jeff kept thinking on this fact: it had been such a difference in pain regarding one of the worst things any man could experience. It was like having a permanent cup in place, minus the testes inside. He mulled it over in his head, making a list: erections weren’t as obvious, peeing felt way better, masturbating was more pleasurable and easier to achieve, and he didn’t have to worry about cock shots.<br />
<br />
But... no. No, today was the last day with this THING. And that was that. No matter what the pros, there was one constant concern: he didn’t have a penis, and he wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep that fact hidden from the world.<br />
<br />
The day continued along at a normal pace. Aside from his classes, very little happened to Jeff between biology and dismissal. The ride home, though routine, carried a sense of wonder and excitement with it, with Jeff knowing that a fully loaded Chronivac would be awaiting him.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, as he entered his room, he found the Chronivac exactly where he had left it, still plugged in. The timer had finally reached “0 Hours, 0 Minutes, 0 Seconds... READY”, and was just a quick series of selections away from getting Jeff his old life back. Before he could begin, though, he heard his mom coming up the stairs, and swiftly began pretended to reading from a nearby textbook.<br />
<br />
“Jeffrey... oh, good, you’re doing schoolwork. Pleased to see not all your time is spent with your hands down your pants.” Jeff blushed slightly, as that was exactly the first thing he was going to do the second he got his penis back. However, he kept his act of insincere studiousness up. “Yup. Just, reviewing some stuff for class tomorrow. Is everything okay?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ll have you know, I ran into someone outside earlier today. The Ferguson girl, Brianna, from up the road?”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his body get a chill. This wasn’t inherently bad news, but the following few sentences, he knew, could quickly change all of that.<br />
<br />
“Oh, r-really? And, how is she?”, Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“She wanted to speak with you, but I told her you were busy. She wanted me to give you this, so that you two could get in touch.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mother handed him a slip of paper, with ten numbers written down on it. Was... was this her phone number???<br />
<br />
Part of Jeff felt embarrassed that his mom knew Brianna wanted to hear from him, but a much larger part was overjoyed at this news.<br />
<br />
“I told her you’d respond as soon as you were able. She was happy about that... what a lovely girl.”<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel his mom hinting at something, but he was too ecstatic to care. He was about to get his breast... er, THE breast, off of himself, and he had just gotten Brianna’s phone number. This double hit of good news made him far too happy to care about his mom&#39;s insinuations, accurate or not.<br />
<br />
“Thanks mom. I’ll, uh, text her as soon as I finish up my homework.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mother nodded, and left without another word. Too excited to wait, Jeff picked up his phone and texted Brianna.<br />
<br />
-Hey! It’s Jeff.<br />
<br />
Only six minutes passed before she responded.<br />
<br />
-Hi!!! Sorry was walking home lol have you recovered from my bro&#39;s terrible party? Hope you got your project in on time and glad your mom passed on my #<br />
<br />
-yeah I&#39;m good! Really glad to hear from you, and sorry I had to skip out for homework :( haha<br />
<br />
-it&#39;s okay! If you wanna make it up, you can hang out with me this Friday or the weekend? After school?<br />
<br />
Was she inviting him over? Wow! Jeff, eager to accept this increasingly sweet deal, couldn&#39;t believe his luck, and latched into an opportunity he had in the back of his mind<br />
<br />
-Friday works, we have school off for teacher meetings<br />
<br />
-OMG me too! So weird. Illuminati conference maybe XD<br />
<br />
Jeff remembered there and then that Brianna went to a different school, one town over. An all girls school for students above a certain GPA. He recalled, albeit slowly, that this had been part of the reason they never really stayed in touch after elementary school; more of an issue of circumstance than choice.<br />
<br />
-Haha maybe. So Friday is good? What time?<br />
<br />
-Noon sound okay? You can come visit without a million other people around! No stress this time, promise<br />
<br />
-Sounds perfect. I&#39;ll be there!<br />
<br />
-Awesome! See you then :3<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his heart flutter. Had he just set up a date with Brianna? Hopefully it was a date, at least. But why else would she give him her number? Even still, just being able to talk to her was such an intense feeling, that he had almost forgotten about the Chronivac-<br />
<br />
The Chronivac!<br />
<br />
Sitting back down in front of it, the breast squashing against his left thigh, Jeff began to try and use the device. Attempting to access the editing menu so he could configure his groin back to what it was rightfully meant to be, he hit the appropriate control keys to do so.<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Chuckling nervously, Jeff tried once more. It was like it was frozen, the device not displaying anything more active than the timer&#39;s counter at zero.<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned, a feeling of icy coolness seizing him. He tried again. No response. Again. No response. Was it dead? Did he have to unplug it and restart it?<br />
<br />
Trying to remain calm and seeing no other options, Jeff did just that. After booting it up once more, he tried the interface for a fifth time, when-<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
“..... Stupid GODDAMN-”<br />
<br />
In a split second of rage, Jeff smacked the side of the Chronivac, prompting the machine to flicker and spew large strings of garbled text across the screen.<br />
<br />
&!6)57_~##^#=‘n..:hu-d/;76&38@&)5438:;;?)5$-(;’Yeg,)4.?6& ..... LOAD1NH..... KOADUNG..... LOA-ING.....<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as the Chronivac screen cleared and presented a new but horribly familiar message, very similar in content to the one he saw three days ago:<br />
<br />
“Sincerest apologies, but there seems to have been a hardware and/or software reset issue with the Chronivac. Unfortunately, in order to keep any dimensional rifts or quantum anomalies from manifesting and/or spiraling out of control, this unit has initiated a further reset cool-down period. It will be inoperable until the timer  has finished running out. Thank you for your understanding, and thank you for using the Chronivac 4.0!”<br />
<br />
Quivering with a mix of shock and anger, Jeff glanced down at the timer.<br />
<br />
“167 Hours, 59 Minutes, 53 Seconds... 167 Hours, 59 Minutes, 52 Seconds...”<br />
<br />
Knowing exactly what he would find, he nevertheless opened his pants and checked. Sitting in the middle of his groin, as real and immovable as it had been for the last three days, was the breast.</p>
