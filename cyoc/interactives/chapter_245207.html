<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The “parents” of “Vicky” and Ice meet up the following morning, and in a matter of minutes, they agreed to hold the wedding on Saturday of the upcoming weekend, which is only two days away, so the “parents” waste no time to get everything organized: reaching out to the church, calling in tailors to get their “children” and themselves measured for the dresses and suits, sending invitations to associates, organizing the food and drinks and music for the feast, and having decided that the honeymoon and “special night” should take place at the private forest mansion of Ice’s “family”, where the freshly married couple could enjoy some weeks of peace and quiet everything is ready for the big day.<br />
<br />
As the “big day” slowly approaches, Tyler finds himself growing more and more nervous, it is Friday afternoon, and the dress, which he’d be wearing, had arrived, so Tyler is currently in his room, being helped into the dress by two female servants, the young “vixen” with the mind of a 12-year-old fox-boy, stares at “herself” in the mirror with a mixture of amazement and shock.<br />
<br />
‘Damn… I look absolutely stunning,’ Tyler thinks to himself, ‘this RP is so realistic, which makes it kinda creepy, but also extremely exciting. It’s so weird being a young female, this body feels so wrong, but it’s kinda interesting being a female, I’m curious how this RP will continue’.<br />
<br />
It takes an hour to get the dress on, the dress is hugs Tyler’s body tightly, showing off “her” amazing figure. The dress, just above her chest and the long sleeves is see through, while the rest of the dress is not, it also has a stand-up collar, and a flowery pattern, in addition it also has a long veil.<br />
<br />
“Oh. My. God,” Tyler’s “mother” gasps when she see her “daughter” in the dress, “y-you look absolutely stunning!”<br />
<br />
“Th-thanks… mom,” the “vixen” says, sounding nervous.<br />
<br />
“No need to be nervous, my dear,” the mother says, smiling, “I know what you are going through, but once you are standing at that altar, next to your future husband, and once you kiss him for the first time… believe me, the nervousness just disappears”.<br />
<br />
‘Kissing an adult male feels so wrong, but I can’t help feeling extremely curious,’ Tyler thinks to himself, ‘I mean… it’s just a kiss… what harm can it cause? Besides, it won’t be any different from when my dad or mom kiss me, right,’ Tyler is unaware that the kiss will not be like he thinks it will be. The “vixen” imagines the kiss to simply be a quick peck on the lips, however, “she” is unaware that this particular kiss will involve Ice slipping his tongue into her mouth.<br />
<br />
On the day of the wedding, Tyler’s nervosity has decreased a little, however, when the time comes to be lead to the altar by his proud “father”, he feels his nervousness rise.<br />
<br />
“Take deep breaths,” Ice whispers when Tyler takes position next to him, “it will be over soon. Maybe it’ll help you to know that I’m just as nervous as you are, after all: this is the first time either of us gets married. See it as a good training for when you marry in our real reality”.<br />
<br />
Tyler gives a little nod, “thanks, Ice,” he whispers, “actually, standing close to you makes me feel a little less nervous, and you are right: this is a good practice”.<br />
<br />
Ice gives Tyler a smile, his tail wagging, “by the way, Vicky,” he says, “you look absolutely stunning in that dress. You really make a great woman… hehe…”.<br />
<br />
Hearing this causes Tyler to let out a soft chuckle, “you don’t look to bad yourself, Ice,” he says back, smiling himself.<br />
<br />
Both then hear the priest clear his throat, so both turn to the alter, seeing the priest smiling at them, “sorry for interrupting your little talk,” he says, “let’s get this ceremony over with, then you have all the time in the world to talk”.<br />
<br />
Both Ice and Tyler blush, “sorry”.<br />
<br />
The priest chuckles, “no need to be sorry,” he says, “I’ve married hundreds of couples, you are not the worst I had to deal with,” he adds with a wink.<br />
<br />
“We can only imagine,” Ice and “Vicky” say.<br />
<br />
The priest smiles, “now, let’s get the ceremony started,” he says, “who has the rings?”<br />
<br />
A young looking raccoon-boy gets to his feet and nervously steps forward, “I… I have the ring for the br-bride,” he mumbles, handing it to the priest before smiling shyly up at Ice and “Vicky”, blushing a little, before heading back to his seat.<br />
<br />
The priest blesses the ring before handing it to Ice, who takes it before turning to “Vicky”, taking her hand and slowly slips the ring onto the white glove of the dress, ich hand trembling slightly.<br />
<br />
“Man… that was… a challenge,” Ice chuckles nervously.<br />
<br />
Tyler stares down at the ring on his finger, “it… it’s beautiful,” he breaths.<br />
<br />
Next a young cat-girl gets to her feet, stepping forward, “here is the groom’s ring, sir,” she says shyly, handing it to the priest.<br />
<br />
Again the priest blesses the ring before handing it to “Vicky” who takes it and slips it on Ice’s finger, her hand trembling.<br />
<br />
“You weren’t kidding,” the “vixen” says, “that must have been the most difficult task I’ve ever done”.<br />
<br />
At this the crowed lets out soft chuckles, even the priest can’t help himself, this causes Ice and Tyler to relax, both smiling, chuckling and rubbing the back of their heads.<br />
<br />
Once everyone has calmed down, the priest continues, turning first to Ice, “lord Ice, lady Victoria to be your wife? Do you promise to be faithful to her in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love her and honor her all the days of your life?”<br />
<br />
Ice takes a deep breath, “I do”.<br />
<br />
The priest then turns to “Victoria”, “lady Victoria, do you take lord Ice to be your husband? Do you promise to be faithful to him in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love him and honor him all the days in your life?”<br />
<br />
‘What Tyler doesn’t know, when he replies with “I do”, then we’ll not only be married in this reality but also in our real reality,’ Ice thinks to himself, mentally smirking, ‘however, no one, including HIM, will be aware of that, though he’ll feel a strong connection towards me, which, when separated, will cause him to want nothing more than to be with me!’<br />
<br />
“I…,” the “vixen” begins, then hesitates, ‘come on, Ty, it’s just an RP, you aren’t marrying him for real,’ Tyler thinks to himself before taking a deep breath and says, “I do”.<br />
<br />
Ice grins when he feels the atmosphere tremble as the spell he had cast take affect, however this goes unnoticed by everyone else, ‘hehe… now HE is officially MINE for all eternity,’ he thinks to himself, ‘hehe… in this realm AND in the real one!’<br />
<br />
After replying with “I do”, Tyler feels his nervousness suddenly be replaced by calmness and happiness, a small smile appearing on his face, ‘wow, that actually caused my nervousness to go away,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I feel so relieved, calm and happy,’ unaware that he is affected by whatever spell Ice had cast.<br />
<br />
The priest raises his hands above the couple, he then prays for their blessings, “what god joins together, let no one put asunder,” he then says, lowering his arms, and with a big smile he says, “I declare you husband and wife! You may now kiss!”<br />
<br />
Tyler and Ice turn to face each other, Ice smiles down at his wife, who finds “herself” lost in the fox’s blue eyes, before leaning in and pressing his lips against HERS.<br />
<br />
Without even thinking, once he feels Ice’s lips against his, Tyler finds himself closing his eyes as he wraps his arms around the male vulpine and opens his mouth, and when he feels Ice’s tongue slip into his mouth, the “vixen”, without thinking, starts to wrestle with his tongue as they start kissing deeply as the whole crowed cheers.</p>
