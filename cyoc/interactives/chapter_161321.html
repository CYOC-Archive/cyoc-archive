<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day had just begun and as Kyle awoke to his body being more akin to being a herd bull, he sat up, and bumped his chin at the pointed end to his twenty-plus inch long bull Penis; it standing as still erect.<br />
<br />
Grumbling a groan, he wishing to speak his mind when the two girls would arrive, Kyle tried but what gibberish came out his mouth sounded to him as foolishly stupid for trying. Instead he thought to himself, “Oh brother, hmm, would it be considered as sexual it I mouthed it, tonguing it, the pointy end?<br />
<br />
NO, best not, as one orgasm and even if not fully transformed, as when, the new bullish me would be the permanent new me; take care there Kyle.” He thinking thought better to argue with his new, strange body. He wanted to tell Jen of how sorry he was for putting her through a transforming sort of erotic hell situation; and placate his situation some, as his changing being consensual, he rather liked how he was transforming.<br />
<br />
Still human enough to begin a new day with his usual daily routines, Kyle sauntered to the bathroom, planning to brush his teeth, comb his hair, shave, and take his usual slug of five different high potency vitamin pills.<br />
<br />
Grinning at his black furred reflection in the bathroom mirror, his teeth looked different, blocky-square, his eye teeth gone, maybe fell out during the night, leaving a discernable gap.<br />
<br />
Black furred hands reached to pluck out of the tooth brush holder mounted to the bathroom tiled wall beside the countertop and sink, he picked up from a drawer the Arm and Hammer brand of his favorite tooth paste. Spreading a glob of paste on his toothbrush, Kyle began to scrub his more bovine reconfigured teeth.<br />
<br />
Even as he scrubbed at cleaning his teeth, Kyle chuckled, thinking that if he messed up and became as a bull, and doomed to remain a bull, his brushing of teeth would cease and as of right then already, he need not try to shave his face clean of the grown black fur.<br />
<br />
His sauntered walk to the bathroom helped to slacken his bullish size erection, the long pink cock slithering back into its furred sheath; allowing him some semblance of male dignity when the girls should arrive. <br />
<br />
Absent of a reasoned thought, Kyle picked up his hair brush to comb his crop of hair, only to gawk at his reflection, seeing black fur having grown to cover all of his head, face, chin and neck. He thought to make a puckish grin at his changed self, only to note more how with having thicker lips, he needed to roll back his upper lip as though if or when a bull he would do a flehmen, the sexual sniffing reaction done by male during rut.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head in an act of foolhardy disbelief about how his daily regimen was to change as he would know more changing, he sighed what sounding as a soft sort of moo. Sauntering his manner of walking as still able to balance and stand upright, Kyle went to open his closet, and pick out a shirt and pants to wear for the day.<br />
<br />
“Dah…muroo,” Kyle moaned, as his body was changing, and with black fur as a full body pelt, he wondered if there was any reason for him to wearing of clothes while changing.<br />
<br />
A half turn with the thought to wearing of socks and or shoes, he panned a look down at what were his feet, and shook his head, knowing of Jen’s curse; that by the next day he would have gained the full hind quarters, legs, hocks, feet, and cloven hoofs like on a bull. To the thoughts of what would happen more, he sighed as to his sense of dismay.<br />
<br />
“Breakfast,” he thought, and again walking with a strange, as unsteady gait to the kitchen, Kyle took from the cupboard a vegetable serving dish, it eight inches across, as a worthy bowl for him to munching from a heaping bowl full of Cheerios.<br />
<br />
Ready then for adding the milk, Kyle stopped, and thought for a moment, as wondered if he might try foraging, lip eating from the bowl as practice make for perfection if he had to learn how to graze.<br />
<br />
As with the big bowl held with blackened and furred hands, Kyle thought to go sit in the living room swiveling chair and waiting, eat and watch for when the girls should arrive. As he eased down his furry self into the comfortable chair, he had a thought that if as when he is a bull, how he would miss his human creature comforts.<br />
<br />
Munching a mouthful of his Cheerios, he reached for the TV remote and switched on Fox morning news, seeing the weather report for the coming week while he would be changing of species. Realizing the futility of watching what when as a bull he would not give a rip-shit care, he switched off the TV, returning with earnest at learning to eat with sing his face and no utensils.<br />
<br />
As the last of the Cheerios were lipped out of the bowl, Kyle heard the old clinker of a car driving into his driveway, the blown muffler as much a sound he knew as Carla’s jalopy car rust bucket. <br />
<br />
He rose then to standing from his easy chair, and set the big bowl on the end table beside his living room chair.<br />
<br />
“Ding-dong,” rang the doorbell, and a silly feeling gamester went to answer his front door.<br />
<br />
Peeping through the front door port window, Kyle saw Carla standing closest to the door, with Jen right behind.<br />
Snapping open the bolt lock first, Kyle dialed the doorknob lock, and swung open the front door; as such did not offer any verbal manner of greetings.<br />
<br />
Carla stood and stared at a man coated fully by black fur, having bovine ears, and a partially formed muzzle as both nose and mouth merging. As Carla thought to turn and leave, Jen did some shoving and pushed Carla inside, as passing Kyle, the two girls entered the living room and Jen smiled as Carla stood and grimacing her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Well, well,” Jen said, “I can see you are playing the Transform or Dare game, as it looks as though you are on the losing end.”<br />
“Kyle,” Carla said as if questioning, wondering if what she saw standing before her as naked, covered with a black fur pelt, and having ears what swayed.<br />
<br />
“Muroo…,” Kyle said his best as able greeting!<br />
<br />
“What is,” Carla began to ask of either Kyle or Jen.<br />
<br />
“It was from what Kyle did to me, that I propositioned with his transform or dare, to which he thought the lesser of two evils as to accept being transformed.” Jen began to explain, as she took to petting of Kyle about his chest, shoulder and giving his belly mounted sheath a slight tweaked pinch.<br />
<br />
As Jen added, “I will not explain fully of what he made me to become, as my transforming had me be a vile, erotic, minor of being human and more of being equine, as had to stay inside and hide.<br />
<br />
I made it difficult for Kyle, as with his slow, seven days of transforming to being a Black Angus bull, an animal, there are clauses, pitfalls, that if he masturbates or enjoys sex during his changing time, his transformed self would permanently retain being for him as a bull.<br />
<br />
I thought it through and added a second duty to his transforming, that being after he would become a bull, Kyle has a cow mating quota. If he is horny and diligent, as after his second week of being a bull, herd sire, he could become again as his human self.<br />
<br />
However, if he fails to breed, mating enough cows during the week, his changing to be a herd sire bull could again become his new, as permanent self. As there is a third clause which he alone could trip, and that being if after he has enjoyed a week of mating with cows as would a bull; sniffing of cow rumps, licking of cow vulvas, and mounting, mating, humping, breeding that he decides his being a bull animal is more a fun lifestyle, then he could remain a bull, permanently!”</p>
