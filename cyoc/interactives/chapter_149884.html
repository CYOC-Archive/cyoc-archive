<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer stayed on the ground until Kyle and her sister had left the room, not wanting to give Kyle another glimpse of her dick and getting fucked in the butt again. She got up and peeked out the door to see if the others were out of the hall, and entered the room at the end of it. She was greeted by a white walpaper with pink male symbols on it. To the left side of the room was a mirror with tiny dick stickers hanging around it, to the other side was a closet. Kyle was really rubbing in the loss of her womanhood. Her new room also didn&#39;t have a bed, Kyle would be deciding where she slept now and no matter what she did it wouldn&#39;t be here.<br />
<br />
Looking at herself in the mockinly decorated mirror, it occured to Jen that she really was a he now, but she refused to start thinking of herself that way.  She opened the closet and found an assortment of women&#39;s clothes. At least she could still dress like a lady. She had more presing concerns than the body she got stuck in, like being enslaved to a perverted little god that hated her guts.<br />
<br />
Jennifer knew that she had to be tactical about her choice of clothes. If she was going to rape her sister, she couldn&#39;t afford to have them obstruct her. And she was going to rape her sister if she got the opportunity. As much as she might love her sister, the few seconds of getting fucked in the ass she experienced were unbearable. She couldn&#39;t endure that for a whole night, so her morals would just have to go out the window.<br />
<br />
After a short period of deliberation, Jennifer picked out a white sundress. It was long enough to prevent onlookers from spotting her dick, but it was short enough that she could lift it up completely without having to bend over. Jennifer was not going to be wearing panties, she would only waste precious seconds taking them off, and she was not going to balance herself in heels either. Jennifer put on a pair of yellow sneakers over white knee high socks, her closet didn&#39;t have anything shorter, and used a hairpin to tie her long blonde hair into a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She also picked out a thin yellow scarf to put around her neck. The scarf wouldn&#39;t help her rape her sister in any way but at least she wouldn&#39;t have to see her disgusting adam&#39;s apple every time she looked in a mirror.<br />
<br />
Jennifer checked herself out in the mirror one last time. She looked like a really flat girl at a glance, but as the mirror&#39;s design reminded her, she really wasn&#39;t. She decided to do a little test run before she left. Kyle had told her she would be easily aroused, so she went and thought of one of her movie crushes. And sure enough, she felt a pressure near her groin as her tiny dick got hard. She briefly lifted up her dress, flashing herself with her own erection, and left her room. The pressure subsided as she went down the stairs.<br />
<br />
In the dining room she found Kyle sitting at a made table with a cup of tea, and Kate standing in the corner with her hands behind her back, still exposing her pussy to the world and now wearing high heels. She wondered how Kate could keep herself balanced in those with as little muscle as she had, but she figured Kyle had changed the rules for her.<br />
&quot;and even if you weren&#39;t friends, I still wouldn&#39;t let you go. To be blunt, I just love making people miserable.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh hey Jennifer, I just finished filling your sister in on her situation. But all this talking is making me hungry, so would you two go be a good little pair of slaves and make me some bacon and eggs?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot;, they said, and went into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
With some effort, Kate lifted a small frying pan out from below the kitchen counter and started melting some butter in it. &quot;Could you get the bacon out of the fride&quot; she told Jennifer in a resigned tone. Jennifer opened the fridge, imagined some hot guys and swept the legs out under her unsuspecting sister. Kate fell to the floor, with her back to the stove.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!?&quot; Shouted Kate in panic, but Jennifer was already spreading Kate&#39;s legs with her own. &quot;Jennifer no!&quot; But Jen was commited, putting one hand to her sister&#39;s throat to prevent futher screaming and once she&#39;d pulled up her dress, pushed Kate&#39;s arm to the wall with the other. Her dick went in. Having her dick in anything was a forgein sensation to Jen, but her sister&#39;s pussy was pleasantly warm and soft. However, the vagina didn&#39;t stimulate her dick all that much, being too roomy to really put pressure on Jennifer&#39;s exceptionally thin member, so she resorted to just rubbing it on its walls. Kate tried to push Jennifer away with her legs and to tear off her chokehold, but she was too weak to even move one finger off her throat.<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed that the body she saw before her didn&#39;t resemble her sister in any way. She figured that if she just looked away from the woman&#39;s face, she could just imagine that she was raping some random skank. She thrust her dick in and out feeling a pleasant sensation in her balls and getting closer to a climax. Jennifer was so focussed on taking her mind off her own horrific actions that she didn&#39;t notice Kate reaching for the frying pan. Jennifer felt an impact on her head and fell backwards, returning Kate&#39;s freedom momentarily. But rather than make a futile attempt to run away from her sister on heels, Kate reached forward and started to rub Jen&#39;s dick vigorously. A few seconds later, Jennifer cursed as a small white glob shot out of her dick and landed on the floor. She didn&#39;t come inside her sister, so even though she just forcefully penetrated her sister Kyle wouldn&#39;t count this as rape.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked up to see her sister&#39;s face, filled with betrayal and stained with tears. &quot;How could you do this to me?&quot; Jennifer didn&#39;t answer. She tried to ignore the pit in her stomach and started thinking on how to salvage this situation. She might&#39;ve messed up the first time and her dick seemed unwilling to get hard again for the moment, but it would get hard again if she gave it a little rest. All she had to do was keep her sister pinned down until then, and she would be able to rape her without issues.<br />
<br />
But as Jennifer prepared to pin her sister to the floor again, Kyle&#39;s voice rang in their heads. &quot;You&#39;re taking a little long, ladies. You&#39;d better hurry up that breakfast or I&#39;ll have to take measures. Oh and Kate, you&#39;d better wash your hands, I won&#39;t be eating jizz.&quot; Jennifer realized she didn&#39;t have the time to make another attempt and proceeded to make the breakfast without saying a word, grateful that the sizzling of the grease drowned out her sister&#39;s sobbing.<br />
<br />
Kyle complimented Jennifer for her attempt and ate his meal while the siblings stood in the corner of the room, awaiting futher instructions.</p>
