<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You&#39;re in the waiting room outside what seems to be an office. You&#39;re sitting in a nice, comfortable, fabric chair, right across from the door. It&#39;s wooden and nice and has a big plaque on it saying the interviewer&#39;s name and title: &quot;Dr. Van Ichtor - Company Executive&quot;. You&#39;re a little nervous, but comfortable. Giving off a strong impression is important to you, and you&#39;re going to nail this opportunity. You review a few notes in your head, both technical and personal, just to go through things one more time. After a short wait, you hear the door open and a deep voice from the other side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m ready to see you now.&quot; says the man as he comes into your line of sight, opening the door. This man was absolutely built. You estimate his height to be 6&#39;8 or so, and he fills it out with muscle quite nicely. The suit he&#39;s wearing is high class and completely crisp on him, and his silk tie just screams professional. You decide to not let this get intimidating man get the best of you, and stand up, smooth off your clothing, and approach him with a firm handshake. He pulls you into his office, and you sit down in the leather chair while he goes back to his side where his computer is.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind if I type some notes onto my computer while I work. I have your resume open here too and just would like to confirm some things and ask for some clarifications.&quot; he says, turning the screen slightly to show you his notepad and your resume, open side by side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, Dr. Van Ichtor.&quot; you say, nonchalantly. It&#39;s important to keep a professional attitude about these things and you certainly don&#39;t mind anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just Dr. Ichtor. But you can call me by my first name, Van.&quot; he says, and then proceeds on with the interview. &quot;So, you went to the state university I see. It&#39;s fairly prestigious. I can see most of your accomplishments are tied to your grades and courses, did you work with any clubs or societies while you were there?&quot;<br />
<br />
You frown a little bit, it&#39;s a tough first question. &quot;Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t particularly have the opportunity while I was there to join any such things. I was quite busy trying to attain my top grades, and working my part time job on weekends and some evenings.&quot; you reply. It&#39;s an honest answer to address a hole in your resume. You just weren&#39;t so thrilled to find it poked at right away.<br />
<br />
Dr. Ichtor raises his eyebrow and starts typing away for a moment. &quot;Ah, wait!&quot; he says, like he found a discovery. &quot;I must&#39;ve missed this detail. It says that you were involved in the campus LGBT+ society. Can you tell me about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
A buzz rushes through your head. LGBT society? You couldn&#39;t remember that, and why would you? You&#39;re not gay! I mean, you didn&#39;t have a problem with gay people but why involve yourself in a society you weren&#39;t a part of. But your mouth starts speaking without your thought process attached. &quot;Ah, sorry about that. An oversight on my part. I joined up in first year to see what it was, and we worked on things such as activism and awareness of how gay society is. I even started a branch with some of the people in accounting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Ichtor smiles, &quot;Good.&quot; he said, typing a few more notes into the computer. He hums and haws for a moment, before asking the next question. &quot;So, can you tell me about your part time jobs? I&#39;ve never heard of this &#39;Killan&#39;s&#39; establishment before, let&#39;s start there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. That was my high school job, which I continued partway into my first year of studies. It was a bit far away once I moved near campus, so I couldn&#39;t continue working other than weekends, and they let me go. It was just a simple barbecue restaurant, ribs and wings and the like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Ichtor types away a bit. &quot;I&#39;ve googled the location, looks like it&#39;s a bit of a biker hangout too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, you get that crowd sometimes. Bikers, gay bears, lots of friendly folk. You get families and groups of young people coming in on the day to day as well though. It&#39;s pretty diverse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; said Dr. Ichtor. &quot;So then you worked at a clothing outlet at the mall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mostly just doing cash. It was a part time job to help offset my studies. I stayed there until the end of my degree. Having a discount on nice clothing helped too. Not that I was in it for the benefits, mind you, but certainly being able to afford more professional clothing on a student budget was a decent resource.&quot; you replied.<br />
<br />
More typing. &quot;Professional? Your resume lists you as working at that fetish store in the back of the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
A fetish store? Why would your resume ever say that? Just because you were gay didn&#39;t mean that you were into all kinds of crazy and kinky things. And certainly that wasn&#39;t a proper inference from the resume to make, anyway! But you spoke on, &quot;Well, actually they&#39;re partnered, believe it or not. But yes, a discount on the fetish gear came in handy many times too. Maybe not the most appropriate interview topic though.&quot; You said, trying to express that you were a little uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Dr. Ichtor frowned at you, which made you a bit nervous. He started typing again, and then said &quot;Right. I think it&#39;s important though. Our company really values that you be yourself. Being open and honest is important, so I need you to cooperate with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel calm, all of a sudden. &quot;Of course, Van.&quot; you reply. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you anything you want. What would you like to discuss now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Van smiles at you, &quot;Thank you. I only ask for your cooperation.&quot; You feel a wave of pleasure from hearing him say this. &quot;Let&#39;s discuss your hobbies. We&#39;re almost through your resume. It only says here that you&#39;re into pleasing your male partners?&quot;<br />
<br />
You eagerly respond, &quot;Yes! Really other than work I don&#39;t do much, so I try to conform to the man I&#39;m with and do what makes him happy. I&#39;m kind of a hopeless romantic, in my own kind of way. I&#39;d really like to build a life together with someone based on their own interests and we can make them shared ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Ichtor nods while typing a few things down. &quot;Well, that&#39;s a good start. How about we call this interview a wrap for now and I take you down to the basement for a brief tour of where you&#39;ll be working most of the time? Before that, do you have any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause for a second, you&#39;re sure you had a burning question before. Your head is such a fog though, and you know Dr. Ichtor will take care of it, but then it comes suddenly to you. &quot;Oh!&quot; you exclaim, &quot;What does this company do again?&quot; Forgetting the basic interview etiquette of always doing your research first.<br />
<br />
Dr. Ichtor just chuckles. &quot;We&#39;re a company who works with men to please them. Our workers act in their best interests, and satisfaction is guaranteed on all fronts. You&#39;re going to make a perfect fit. Let&#39;s go downstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
The behemoth of a man stands up, and shakes your hand firmly. You get up and follow him down through a couple of flights of stairs through the building down to the basement, where there&#39;s a large metal door. He swipes a key card and it unlocks. He walks in, with you right behind him. What you see absolutely shocks you. There are men, everywhere, suspended in giant tanks. At least 20 of them, maybe more. Some have wires and needles poking into them, all have a gas mask over their mouth and headsets over their head. Some scientists are working in the center of the room on serums and electric devices. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is this, Dr. Ichtor?&quot; you ask, timidly. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is no need to worry, this is your new home.&quot; he says to you as he grabs your hand and holds it. It&#39;s very comforting for this large man to be gripping onto you while you&#39;re so insecure. &quot;We please men by fulfilling their fantasies. Just like what you love to do! You&#39;re going to enter one of these tanks, and when we need you we can take you out of it and you can please men easily!&quot;<br />
<br />
You start to feel happy that you can work at such a great place. Dr. Ichtor leads you to an completely empty tank around the corner of the room and opens it up for you, telling you to strip and walk in. You eagerly remove your suit and the rest of your clothing as one of the scientists approaches. He hands you a pair of headset, which you put over your head. Dr. Ichtor guides you inside the tank, and closes the door. A breathing mask drops down from below. &quot;Put this on,&quot; you&#39;re instructed by the scientist, so you do. &quot;Now you&#39;re going to feel light, but don&#39;t worry. This is completely normal. We will wake you when it&#39;s time!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tank starts filling with a warm fluid from the top. It sprays you, and you start to get wet. As it fills, you begin to float in it partially. By the time the tank is completely filled you&#39;re floating in the middle. It&#39;s an odd, but comfortable sensation. You try to think happy thoughts about how great this job is, but you&#39;re feeling giddy. All of a sudden your vision cuts out as the headset projects a spiral into your eyes and it&#39;s all you can see. Binaural tracks start to play in your ears. You space out entirely, waiting for whatever Dr. Ichtor decides to do with you.<br />
<br />
Outside the tank, Dr. Ichtor had just finished uploading your resume to the computer attached to the tank. He smiled at the scientist. &quot;Truly, our work is incredible. We can create any man to fulfill any fantasy this way. This man seemed particularly malleable. I hope he brings promise.&quot; He heads back up to his office, to the client search. You&#39;ll have your first client soon.</p>
