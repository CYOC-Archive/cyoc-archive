<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin felt his body increasing in size. He cried out in pain as his bones began to <br />
rearrange themselves. His face then began to extend as well as his jaw. Dustin cried out <br />
again as he felt his arms and legs snap into their new positions. Suddenly his clothes <br />
ripped apart as his body continued to grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is, Ow! Going on!&quot; Dustin shouted<br />
<br />
A tail then appeared at the base of his back and it got longer. Dustin felt his teeth fall out <br />
and then began to shake in pain as razor sharp teeth replaced them in his bigger mouth. <br />
His hair fell out and his ears shrank down to nothing, but two small openings that allowed <br />
his to hear. Then two wings began to grow out of his back. Dustin then reached up with his <br />
arms to hold his head as two horns grew out of his head.<br />
<br />
Then Dustin felt his neck become longer and his skin became covered in dark blue scales. <br />
He felt his muscles growing and his wings got bigger. Spikes then sprang all the way from <br />
the back of his head to the tip of his tail. Dustin then watched as his hands grew. His nails <br />
grew into claws as did his toenails. Then finally his transformation was over. Dustin looked <br />
down at his body and screamed-well more like roared, lost ability to speak.<br />
<br />
He then turned to look at his parents and then roared in fear again as he saw two other <br />
dark blue dragons. They were bigger than him and they were staring at each other in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to my home!&quot; said a voice<br />
<br />
All three dragons turned to look and see a dark green Dragoness. They gaped at her and <br />
started to back away in fear. Nazara laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not going any where, Dragon guardians!&quot; she said<br />
<br />
Nazara then blew on all three of them. Dustin felt a warm breeze blow over him and his <br />
mind began to change. He knew he had a name, but it wasn't Dustin. He had never been a <br />
human before in his life. He knew that the Dragoness in front of him was Nazara, Queen <br />
of the Dragons. He knew the other two dragons were his parents and he knew how to talk.<br />
<br />
He looked at his mother Dragon and knew her name was Jewel and then his father whose <br />
name was Markal. He then knew his own name, Dristun. He and his family were the <br />
Guardians of Queen Nazara's son Tyronius, who had been transformed into a human and <br />
sent to earth for his safety. Nazara turned to Markal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Markal, I want you and your family to disguise yourselves as humans and become my <br />
son's family. I want you to protect him with your very lives, am I understood?&quot; Nazara <br />
asked the Dragon.<br />
<br />
Markal bowed his head to his queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your majesty, we are honored to do this mission&quot; he said, Jewel and Dristun both <br />
bowed to her as well.<br />
<br />
Nazara smiled.<br />
<br />
'It worked perfectly' she said to her self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go now and do your duty, I will check in from time to time&quot; she ordered<br />
<br />
Markal bowed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my Queen&quot; then he and his family disappeared.<br />
<br />
Nazara then brought Ty back. As soon as Ty got there he turned back into a Dragon. Ty <br />
looked at his mother, he had an angry look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother, where are my foster parents?&quot; he asked<br />
<br />
Nazara smiled and Ty groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Mother what did you Do?&quot; he asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I only made them more capable of treating you better and to better protect you, Tyronius, <br />
my son&quot; she said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Ty stared at his mother in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;You turned them into Dragons! But, what are they going to think? How are th-&quot; Nazara <br />
cut him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;My son, they do not remember ever being human and their minds have been changed into <br />
those of Dragons. They are now back at home in their old bodies looking and living like a <br />
normal human family should!&quot; said Nazara<br />
<br />
Ty sighed and then looked up at his mom and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess that is better than nothing&quot; he said<br />
<br />
Nazara laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for you to go home, Tyronius. We will see each other again soon!&quot; and then Ty was <br />
back home and in his human form.<br />
<br />
Nazara stared out over her kingdom and then sighed.<br />
<br />
'I am glad that my son is safe' she said to herself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she felt a disturbance in the air, her body grew cold with fear. A Dragon guard <br />
burst into her cave. He bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Queen Nazara! I have terrible news, the dark forces have locked onto your magic! They <br />
know where your son is and they have sent their forces after him!&quot; He said in a worried <br />
tone.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was an explosion from the wall of her cave and the guard turned and blew <br />
fire into the opening. Orcs and minotaurs came running out screaming as they were <br />
covered in flames. Nazara blew her own flame as a small troop of goblins came out, they <br />
fell dead in pills of ash. The guard turned to Nazara.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Queen, you must run! Go I will hold them off!&quot; he then turned and blew fire onto a <br />
small group of human sized rats, weasels and ferret. The animals screamed in pain as they <br />
ran, dropping their swords and shields.<br />
<br />
Nazara then called out in thought to the rest of her guards.<br />
<br />
'We are under attack, they have broken into our kingdom!' she shouted<br />
<br />
Back on earth, Ty was just heading to bed after talking with his &quot;family&quot;. They had been <br />
reluctant to admit that they were his Dragon guardians, but eventually they did. As Ty was <br />
lying in his bed, staring at the ceiling, he felt something appear in his room. He looked <br />
down and screamed! There stood two orcs and a large Minotaur, all armed and headed for <br />
his bed.</p>
