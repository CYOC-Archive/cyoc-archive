<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fukushu NO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now slammed his fists into the door before him. Already he could hear the sounds of battle both behind and in front of him. Everyone was fighting for their lives,  leaving the teen with a choice. Help his friends below him in destroying the time machine or help Fukushu. Regardless he would need to make a decision fast.<br />
<br />
The Boss grinned as he now approached the nine tailed kitsune. To say Fukushu had put on an impressive display would be an understatement. Dozens of his troops lay dead, the lone kitsune having bested each of them. Now though, the Boss had the upper hand. Fukushu was down to his knees, the kitsunes blood pooling around him from the wound the Boss had given him. As he now slowly approached, he couldn&#39;t help but appreciate the irony in how Fukushu would die.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ironic isn&#39;t it,&quot; the Boss stated as he stared down at Fukushu. &quot;I remember your father looking just like this when I killed him. A hole in his torso, his blood seeping everywhere, and him desperately reaching for his sword.&quot; Fukushu grunted, trying to stem the bleeding from the gaping hole in his chest. The kitsune realized the wound was fatal, he had perhaps moments before he would pass, yet his thirst for vengeance pushed him on. He refused to let the Boss win. The Boss simply shook his head, an arrogant smirk across his face as he kicked the kitsunes blade away. Grabbing the kitsunes head, he now pressed his pistol to Fukushus forehead. &quot;This is the end Fukushu,&quot; he said softly. &quot;The Catalyst couldn&#39;t save your pops and he won&#39;t save you.&quot;<br />
<br />
An explosion now caused the very ground to shake, the Boss stumbling backwards. Quickly regaining his footing, he turned towards the explosion, his face contorting in rage as he beheld Darren standing outside once more. &quot;Somebody kill that kid NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren scowled, seeing the approaching soldiers and Normal controlled Soul Drives sprint towards him. Fukushu may have bested a hundred of them but it left a hundred more. As the teens eyes glowed, he held out a hand, the Boss and Fukushu shocked as the kitsunes own blade soared towards the teen, allowing him to wield both Dragons Tongues. Both celestial blades now glowed a brilliant white, the teen unleashing an angry yell as he charged forward.<br />
<br />
Fukushu could do little more than watch, a satisfied smile in his face as he watched the Catalyst. The teen had tapped into a power that even the nine tails was unfamiliar with. Darren moved at nearly incomparable speed, flashes of magic intertwined with attacks from the blades he now wielded. Be it soldier or Soul Drive  all fell before the enraged and empowered teen as he cut his way through the Bosses troops like a knife through butter.<br />
<br />
Angered by this child&#39;s display the Boss now turned from Fukushu to attack Darren. This child would not defeat him, he had planned so carefully, taken every precaution to ensure his victory. With a primal scream he now let loose with a blast of magic. He would finally destroy this Catalyst and ensure his vision of the future.<br />
<br />
Darren grunted, taking the full brunt of the Bosses attack. Useing both Dragons Tongues, he tried to hold the Bosses attack back, digging in his heels as he tried to counter. &quot;YOU CAN&#39;T BEAT ME,&quot; the Boss bellowed, straining as he poured every ounce of strength into his attack. Darren grunted, pushing back as hard as he could, beads of sweat forming on his brow. All the teen could think of was ending this madness.<br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s eyes began to glow white, the teens body pushing past the limits of his powers. With a scream that echoed through the area, Darren countered breaking the spell of the Boss and knocking him back. Stunned the Boss stumbled, a look of shock on his face as the enraged teen glared at him. Before he could act, Darren appeared before him impaling the Boss with both his blades.<br />
<br />
As Darren now stared into the dying Bosses eyes, he noted a look of complete shock. This man had underestimated him, thinking he was untouchable and above this simple teenage boy. With a yell Darren now withdrew his swords, nearly cleaving the Boss in two as he collapsed to the ground dead. Exhausted, the teen now tried to catch his breath. The fight was over, they had won.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sprinting to the kitsune, Darren now cradled him as he slumped into the teens arms. Already the teen could see the life fading from the kitsune, his breathing slowing as a warm smile spread across his face. &quot;You did it,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did it,&quot; Darren said softly. &quot;The Boss is gone. We can make everything like it&#39;s supposed to be.&quot; Fukushu and Darren paused, turning towards the building as Aaron and his friends exited, the teenage Sachiko cradled in the kintaros arms. &quot;Where&#39;s Mia and Zack,&quot; Darren asked. Aaron and the others said nothing, the Grim expression on their faces telling them everything. As they approached, Darren could see the wounds on the teenage kitsune.<br />
<br />
The teenage Sachiko, like Fukushu, was barely clinging to life. Massive wounds covered her body as her blood soaked the kintaro. &quot;Sachiko,&quot; Fukushu whispered, holding out a bloody hand as the kintaro layer her next to him. &quot;Did we do it,&quot; she whimpered. &quot;We did,&quot; Fukushu replied softly, stroking the teenage kitsunes brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu we&#39;ve won,&quot; Darren said quickly. &quot;The Boss is gone. We&#39;ll get you and Sachiko fixed up. We can change the world back to how it&#39;s supposed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Fukushu said softly. &quot;The Boss has too many followers. And the world you knew can not be remade. Their aren&#39;t enough of us left. The Normal will fight over the scraps of his power. This world and magic are doomed!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don&#39;t believe that,&quot; Darren exclaimed, his eyes welling with tears. &quot;We&#39;ve fought so hard. We can make a better world!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can,&quot; Fukushu said weakly. &quot;By stopping all this before it starts. We&#39;ve won this battle but you must stop the Normal from taking power.&quot; Darren wiped his eyes, giving the kitsune a stiff nod as he looked to his friends. &quot;Let us help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to help me find me,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;Go, stop this before it starts. For now leave me and Sachiko. I wish to spend my final moments in this time with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren nodded, turning to his friends. There was an unspoken understanding what must be done, they would need to journey to the past, to stop the Normal before any of this happened. &quot;I promise,&quot; Darren said softly as he layed Fukushu&#39;s sword beside him. &quot;I won&#39;t let them win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck,&quot; Aaron stated. Darren nodded, the teen now casting a spell to take his friends into the past. As Fukushu watched Darren and the others vanish, he could only sigh in contentment as his vision began to blur. Hopefully the Catalyst could prevent any of this from happening.</p>
