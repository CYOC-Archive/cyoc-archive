<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in the room Alicia hid her purchases. She decided she would present the dress for Henry tomorrow. They could do the arm swap tonight and Henry would be able to wear his new dress. The earrings were for this evening. Alicia did not like the pineapple earrings Henry had bought for himself. They were cheap and nasty. These topaz drop earrings should look much better. And once they were home she could get them fixed so she could wear them in her pierced ears. They were certainly too expensive to throw away once Henry began to look male once more. But before she presented the earrings to Henry there was something else which she was now very eager to do.<br />
<br />
Henry was also excited but apprehensive. His hangover was only just starting to wear off. He was very aware of the void between his legs. The thought of experiencing sex as a woman was titillating but oh so scary.  He had picked up his book and sat on the couch once he was back in the room but was finding it very hard to concentrate on his book. <br />
<br />
He had been sitting there with his dress hiked up exploring how his crotch felt through the lacy panties when Alicia had returned. He had got himself wet. When he had heard Alicia opening the door he had reluctantly straightened himself out and began to pretend to read the book. Alicia had gone straight to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Henry heard the toilet flush then Alicia came into the lounge. She was still wearing the sundress she had worn to breakfast. “Did you get what you wanted?” Henry asked<br />
<br />
“Yeah, A couple of gifts and some confirmation”<br />
<br />
“Confirmation of what”<br />
<br />
“Confirmation that your little Hawaiian princess Kailani is pretty hot”<br />
<br />
That got Henrys attention. “Kailani? In the other shop?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I visited her to see if I could get the same reaction you did and it worked. But now I have a problem. I took my panties off and now… well look for yourself” Henry looked where Alicia was indicating. Her crotch. The sundress she was wearing was tenting outwards in a most inappropriate place.<br />
<br />
“Is that a gun under your dress or are you trying to tell me something?”<br />
<br />
“I’m trying to tell you something”<br />
<br />
“I was hoping you would”<br />
<br />
Alicia took Henry’s hand pulled him upright and led him back to the bedroom. There she undressed him until he was completely naked, carefully rehanging the dress and folding the pretty underwear. Henry would need to put them back on before lunch. She examined her husband’s body. “You really are Rachel today. I don’t think it’s appropriate that I keep calling you Henry” She gently brushed her fingers against the little blonde pubes in Henry’s crotch. “I’m curious. Do you still find me sexually attractive? Without your penis are you now attracted to me or would you rather one of those puppies at breakfast?”<br />
<br />
“I still find you the most attractive person I know”<br />
<br />
“More attractive than Kailani? I found her very attractive” <br />
 <br />
“You are more attractive than Kailani”<br />
<br />
“Touch my breasts”<br />
<br />
“Your breasts?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. The lumps on my chest, not your own” Henry did so. “Did you feel my nipples harden?”<br />
<br />
“I did”<br />
<br />
“I saw your nipples harden as well” Alicia reached over and gave Henry’s nipples a gentle fondle.<br />
<br />
“Did touching me make you feel wet?”<br />
<br />
“It did. I’m wet”<br />
<br />
“Good. That’s how I want you. .......  Do you think you could touch me down there?” She pointed at the tent in her dress “I want to know if touching there makes you feel wet”<br />
<br />
Tentatively Henry reached across and felt the lump in her groin through the material of her floral dress. It felt very big and hard. Henry had touched this penis many times every day of his life. He wasn’t repelled by the thought. <br />
<br />
Alicia asked “Do you like that? Does that make you wet?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure” Alicia looked disappointed. Henry continued “I’m certainly getting wet but I think it’s the thought of being penetrated rather than the thought of touching it. I’m ready Alicia. I want you inside me”<br />
<br />
“Well in that case get this dress off me as I’ve been ready for you all morning”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take Alicia long to get the dress off. She didn’t really need Henry’s help. As he expected she was commando under the dress. Henry watched what used to be his penis pointing at him as Alicia removed her bra. “He’s so big!” he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m pretty sure I got the old version of Mister Marvellous from before you shrunk”<br />
<br />
“Will it hurt?”<br />
<br />
“Not if your wet”<br />
<br />
“Well put it in before you spurt. I don’t think you are going to last long”<br />
<br />
Alicia didn’t wait to be asked twice. She was on top of him in a flash and immediately Henry felt himself speared in his moist passage. It didn’t hurt. He gratefully accepted every inch. Of Alicia’s newly acquired organ. It was an amazing feeling. A feeling he had never imagined. Alicia thrust into him. If anything, Henry wanted more. It felt like Alicia pulled out before she had pushed all the way in. He found himself calling out “Push harder” He wanted to feel all of Mister Marvellous’s length. <br />
<br />
Suddenly he felt the penis pulsing, Alicia moaned loudly then called out “Take that Rachel” and Henry felt his insides fill with fluid. Alicia collapsed on top of him with her breasts pushing against his. “Love you” she whispered in his ear. Henry found himself disappointed. He had not experienced a female orgasm and Alicia was clearly spent.</p>
