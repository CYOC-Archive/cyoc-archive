<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is probably the longest chapter I’ve ever written, but it’s certainly one of my favourites!<br/>
<br/>
This chapter takes place at the same time as the previous one, but what is this all leading to? You’ll find out soon enough!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, a few hundred miles away in the town of Lionsmouth, a young man called Ethan was jerking off in his room. The apartment he lived in with his younger stepbrother and father was tiny, and the walls were thin. He could hear the muffled sounds of the living room TV and quick footsteps just outside his door. He was being as quiet as he could.<br />
<br />
He was lying on his bed with his legs spread apart, wearing a black jumper with the sleeves rolled up, and skinny jeans that were bunched up by his knees. Underneath those clothes was a lean swimmer’s build, with veins running along his forearms and hands.<br />
<br />
His room would’ve been in complete darkness if it wasn’t for the streetlamp outside his window flickering fluorescent light through the curtains. His room looked average for a 20 year old; clothes everywhere, used mugs on his desk, drawers to his dresser hanging open. A pair of speedos and a wet towel dangled over the coat hanger on his door. The room was so untidy one wouldn’t notice the ever-growing pile of cumsocks he had messily tucked away under his bed. The smell of the man’s loads in them was easily overpowered by the general stench of his musk that haunted the walls. He had grown so used to it he couldn’t even smell it anymore, not even when he reached over his bed, picked up one of the socks, and wrapped it around his 5-inch cock.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s gaze was fixed on something across the room; a poster. It depicted a tall, muscular man in various poses wearing nothing but boxers. The logo of an underwear company was neatly placed in the poster’s top-left corner, with the name “CLAYTON ELKES” written in a bold font on the bottom. Clayton was Ethan’s favourite actor and, judging by his handsome face, one could see why. His short black hair and blue eyes sparkled even in the darkness, and his sharp cheekbones and red lips were pushed back into a wide smile. His rock-hard body was so captivating, it was all Ethan could stare at as he jerked off. The 20 year old would occasionally glance at his own toned arms before looking back at the man’s thick biceps.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s eyes then wandered over to the large bulge in Clayton’s boxers, his mind awashed with all sorts of fantasies. They were so tight he could see the outline of Clayton’s thick manhood; it was why he bought the poster. His gaze was fixed on the actor’s crotch. He wanted nothing more than to tear those boxers off.  His pace quickened. His cock twitched. He could feel it; the buildup. He was getting close. Almost there. He looked into Clayton’s blue eyes. Almost. He stared at the man’s body. Almost. That huge cock. Almost. And then—<br />
<br />
“Hey! You’re gonna miss the show!”<br />
<br />
Ethan almost fell off his bed when his stepbrother, James, barged into his room, swinging the door wide open. The bright light of the corridor behind him basked Ethan’s bedroom in a warm glow. The skinny 17-year old was wearing a bright orange shirt with a superhero logo on the front and black cargo shorts. <br />
<br />
James’ eyes took a few seconds to adjust to the darkness, and he reached for the light switch giving Ethan enough time to quickly pull up his jeans, and hide the cumsock without his stepbrother seeing. When the light switched on, Ethan was standing by his bed with a scowl.<br />
<br />
“Fucking knock!” he yelled, “I’ve told you a million fucking times!”<br />
<br />
James was completely unphased at his older stepbrother’s yelling and shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I know, I know but it’s starting! Come on!” he said.<br />
“Okay, just give me a second.”<br />
“Wow, your room smells awful.”<br />
“GET OUT!”<br />
<br />
James scoffed as he left, closing the door behind him. Ethan rolled his sleeves back down and walked to the door. Before he grabbed the doorknob, he looked down at his crotch as saw his boner pushing out through his jeans. It throbbed, aching for release. He was close. ‘Just another minute won’t hurt,’ he thought to himself.<br />
But then he heard his brother yell his name from the living room and so, re-adjusting his bulge, he begrudgingly opened the door and left his room.<br />
<br />
Ethan trudged down the corridor. At its end was a cosy living room and kitchen, with a door leading to tiny bathroom on the other side. The living room had one sofa and a TV with a measly lightbulb dangling in the middle of the ceiling. The light was off however, with the only light coming from the glare of the TV screen. <br />
<br />
Ethan saw James sitting eagerly in the centre of the sofa, his eyes glued to the screen. An assortment of snacks were piled in his lap. The 20 year old sighed and sat next to him, putting a pillow over his crotch. He watched the seemingly endless stream of commercials that blasted from the TV.<br />
<br />
“What is this show anyway?” he said with the least amount of enthusiasm possible.<br />
<br />
“You’ll like it!” said James, “Clayton Elkes plays a superhero in it.”<br />
<br />
Ethan’s cock throbbed hearing the man’s name.<br />
<br />
“Interesting,” he said, trying to sound uninterested.<br />
<br />
“D’you want any snacks?” asked James.<br />
<br />
“I’m good.”<br />
“Try these.”<br />
<br />
Ethan saw a transparent packet of violet and orange candies land on his pillow. He grabbed them and looked closer; Yummies’ Perfectionery. He scoffed.<br />
<br />
“They we’re giving them out for free at school today,” said James.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thanks,” said Ethan, opening the packet.<br />
<br />
“Shhh! It’s on!” said James as he pointed at the TV.<br />
<br />
Ethan watched as the TV suddenly swirled red and blue. Close-ups of bank robbers getting punched flashed on the screen. It then showed a skyscraper on the verge of collapse in front of a beautiful sunset. People were screaming, and smoke billowed from the skyscraper’s base. Firetrucks had gathered by the building’s entrance, and people were running out of it covered in soot.<br />
<br />
“This fire’s too strong! Is there anyone out there?! We need you!” yelled a shirtless fireman, “we need Titano and Bubble Boy!!”<br />
<br />
Then, like shooting stars, two figures flew down from the sky encased in red and blue light. They blocked out the sunset, two perfect silhouettes.<br />
<br />
“There they are!” yelled the fireman.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s eyes widened. In the red shooting star was a giant man, around 8ft or so, with a godlike physique he recognised immediately. The man’s body was covered in tight red spandex, and left very little to the imagination. He flew down and landed next to the fireman, who looked up at him in awe. The TV cut to a closeup of the man’s face and, despite being hidden under a small red mask, Ethan knew who it was; Clayton Elkes. His eyes widened and he could feel his cock leak precum as the camera panned down Clayton’s pecs and defined abs. Clayton was a tall actor, around 6ft5, but standing next to the fireman, he must’ve been around 8ft tall at least! James noticed Ethan’s staring and laughed.<br />
<br />
“Knew you’d like it,” said James, “you know they CGI him to make him taller? Oh here’s my favourite!”<br />
<br />
Landing next to Clayton was a man of shorter height but similar build encased in blue spandex. He had long, curly blonde hair and big brown eyes. However his ass was bigger than anyone else’s. It looked huge in that super costume, so huge is jiggled when he landed. He looked up at Clayton and the pair winked, as text appeared on the screen:<br />
<br />
CLAYTON ELKES and MORGAN FLETCHER are TITANO & BUBBLE BOY!<br />
<br />
Ethan had never been more turned on, and James couldn’t contain his excitement. His shorts were starting to tent with his hardening cock.<br />
<br />
“Damn, he looks so good,” said James.<br />
“Titano’s better. He’s bigger and stronger,” said Ethan, reaching into the packet of Perfectionery.<br />
<br />
“But Bubble Boy’s way cuter,” said James loudly.<br />
<br />
Ethan laughed and ate a few of the colourful candies the flavour was sweet, and enticing. They were delicious. He ate another, and then another.<br />
<br />
The stepbrothers continued watching the TV show as Ethan scoffed half the packet. He watched Titano effortlessly lift the skyscraper in the air, his muscles flexing as he winked at the camera. Ethan’s hardon refused to die down. He could feel the tip of it was wet with precum, and he looked down to see a tiny wet patch in his jeans. His balls were starting to hurt too. Still, he ignored it, eating the candies and watching the show. With each bite the Perfectionery became more and more irresistible. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t until a few minutes later when he started to feel odd. Titano and Bubble Boy were double-teaming a supervillain with a six pack and a wolf’s head. Ethan placed a hand on his stomach and he heard it gurgle as it suddenly grew warm to the touch.<br />
<br />
“Woah. That’s odd,” he said to himself.<br />
<br />
Even James heard the gurgle over the sounds of explosions coming from the TV. He turned his head and looked at his stepbrother.<br />
<br />
“You OK?” he asked.<br />
“Yeah, just ate those things too quickly I guess,” said Ethan, feeling his stomach start to tingle.<br />
<br />
“We’ll don’t hog ‘em. They’re meant for sharing,” said James as he snatched the packet out of Ethan’s hand and started eating the rest of them.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn’t respond, nor could he focus on the show. The tingling sensation in his stomach felt nice, relaxing. However he almost let out a moan when the sensation quickly moved to his crotch, and the feeling of it on his cock almost made him orgasm right on the sofa. He quickly stood up and made his way to the bathroom with one hand over his bulge.<br />
<br />
“I’ll just be a minute,” he said between heavy breaths.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Lemme know if you need anything,” said James, his eyes glued to Bubble Boy fighting fires, sweat trickling down his thick neck. Ethan noticed the tent in James’ shorts, but was too preoccupied to comment on it. He stumbled his way to the bathroom and closed the door behind him, forgetting to lock it.<br />
<br />
Although Ethan was only 5ft11, he had to hunch slightly to fit under the low ceiling of the bathroom. The space between the sink and the opposing wall was just big enough for him to squeeze his way through. He almost knocked his head on the wall light as he sat on the closed toilet seat, and started to unbutton his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, gotta take care of it now I guess,” he whispered.<br />
<br />
He reached into his jeans and pulled out his cock, looking at it in surprise. It looked bigger than before; 9inches with a thicker shaft as opposed to the some 5 inches he was jerking off with in his room. He grabbed it with one hand and could feel the intense heat coming from it. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” he said loudly.<br />
“Everything okay in there?” he heard James from the other room.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m good! I just-woah!”<br />
<br />
The tingling sensation suddenly became more intense as, right before his very eyes, his cock grew another few inches in his grip. He could feel his fingers make room for it as it thickened to an impressive 12inches. The sudden lurch of growth caused a spurt of precum to shoot onto the bathroom sink and Ethan let out a moan. The tingling sensation quickly traveled up from his crotch and over his face, and he rubbed his hand against his cheek, feeling the warmth. He started to panic.<br />
<br />
“Fuck. This isn’t happening. I’m dreaming!” he said to himself.<br />
<br />
“Uhh, are you gonna be long in there? I kinda need to go,” called James.<br />
<br />
“I won’t be long, promise!” said Ethan, taken aback by the sound that came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
His voice felt smoother, and ringed in his ears with more bass. It was his voice, but deeper. He cupped a hand over his neck where the tingling felt strongest and he couldn’t believe his fingers were met with a prominent Adam’s apple.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” he whispered to himself, hearing the new bassy tone of his voice again. <br />
<br />
He got to his feet and forgot to pull his jeans up and they fell to the floor. His foot-long manhood stuck out like a steel rod from his hips, and his balls were now big enough he could feel them sway. As he stood up, he hit his head on the wall lamp with a loud thud.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Fuck!” he yelled. His voice sounded even deeper, with a slightly different timbre than usual. His voice slowly was becoming unrecognisable from what it once was. <br />
<br />
When the tingling sensation on his face strengthened, he needed to see it in-action, and shuffled himself to the mirror above the sink. The rise in his body heat made the bathroom very steamy, and fogged up the mirror. He was starting to sweat under his jumper, and his musk was beginning to fill the space. He reached and wiped the mirror to see his reflection.<br />
<br />
He gazed upon his face. It looked exactly the same as before, except with a slightly more prominent jaw. His blonde hair had darkened slightly. The Adam’s apple bobbed up and down. He stared intently at his reflection in a mixture of shock and curiosity.<br />
<br />
Then, as quick as a flash, the tingling sensation spread to his entire body. He felt like every part of him was vibrating as the room became very warm. His skin was piping hot and caused him to sweat all over. The tingling was sending shockwaves of pleasure along the length of his cock, and another spurt of precum shot out, hitting the mirror. He placed his hands against his head.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is happening to me?!” he yelled.<br />
<br />
James knocked on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
“Come on man I really gotta go! My stomach doesn’t feel good,” he said.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn’t respond, and everything all happened at once. He suddenly hit his head on the ceiling, and he looked down to realise he had grown considerably taller. He must’ve been 7ft, maybe 8ft at least. He grew so tall he could barely fit in the bathroom. His legs were much longer, and not only that but muscle quickly piled on them until they became thick thighs and calves popping with veins. His feet grew a few sizes bigger, easily bursting through his white socks.<br />
<br />
His torso grew too, and the black jumper couldn’t hold it all in. The long sleeves were the first to go, as giant biceps and forearms tore through the fabric. As Ethan grew taller, more of his stomach peeked out from under the jumper until it fit more like a crop top. He watched as a thick set of abs sprouted along his stomach, and he could feel his chest become heavy with two wide pecs. His shoulders broadened and a tear along the centre of the jumper formed. His neck thickened and the Adam’s apple grew sharper. Even though Ethan was speechless, his heavy pants of breath became deeper, until they resembled a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
The last thing to change was face. It shifted almost entirely as his head grew a few sizes larger. Gone was his messy blonde hair, his round face, his brown eyes. In their places were slick black hair, chiselled jaw and cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes. <br />
<br />
“Holy fuck…” he said with an entirely new voice. One he recognised instantly, along with the face. He’d recognise it anywhere.<br />
<br />
Staring back at him, almost completely naked and on the verge of cumming, was Clayton Elkes.<br />
<br />
He tried to take a step back in astonishment but his back was already against the wall. He could feel sweat drip from his body. And the smell, it was new. He had grown used to the smell of his musk, but this smelt much different. More potent, almost sweeter, that lingered longer on the nose. Ethan saw the black jumper had torn slightly between his new pecs, and he grabbed it and tore it off, and a pile of muscle spilled out of it, as well as an intense puff of his new musk. Ethan lifted up one of his muscley arms and saw a patch of armpit hair wet with sweat. The burst of his new manly scent reached his nose and he knew he couldn’t hold it in longer. The air seemed to curve around him, as if invisible waves emanated from his skin.<br />
<br />
“Bro please, Im starting to feel really weird right now,” he heard James’ voice from the other side of the door. The boy sounded desperate. <br />
<br />
Ethan didn’t care. He was too busy exploring Clayton’s body, his body, that he didn’t notice James’ voice had gotten slightly deeper.<br />
<br />
He looked down and saw his throbbing cock leak precum over the sink. Even the smell of his seed was new, and he loved it. He had always wanted to smell Clayton. To taste him, and now he had that chance. He threw all sense of worry away, and he became enamoured with the smell. He didn’t even need to jerk off to feel the buildup and the release coming. He was getting close. He stared in his new, blue eyes that sparkled. He was almost there. <br />
<br />
“Fuck. Fuck I’m gonna…”<br />
<br />
Almost. His eyes wandered down his new, gorgeous body.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!”<br />
<br />
And…<br />
<br />
“That’s it, I’m coming in,” said James.<br />
<br />
…the release.<br />
<br />
“OH FUCK!!” yelled Ethan.<br />
<br />
Just as the bathroom door swung open, Ethan roared with Clayton’s voice as his cock shot out a torrent of cum so fast it splashed off the mirror and went everywhere. The sheer force of his climax pushed him back against the wall, and he was so lost in euphoria to care about where it went. He moaned with each spurt as he had the orgasm of his life.<br />
<br />
James watched the whole thing. He watched what looked like a naked Clayton Elkes in his tiny bathroom shoot out the loads of 4 men. The smell and the heat of the room hit him like a wall, and he was overwhelmed with the sight. He didn’t even try to dodge when the seemingly endless supply of cum bounced off the mirror and the sink, and went straight for him, drenching his shirt and shorts. Once Ethan saw James standing there, covered in his seed, he tried to divert his cock away from him, and after a few more seconds his orgasm stopped and his cock eventually died down. <br />
<br />
The TV was still blasting the sounds of the TV show through its speakers. Ethan and James both stared at each other in shock, with Ethan’s long breaths causing his chest to rise up and down. Cum was dripping from everywhere; the ceiling, the mirror, the sink, James’ shirt. The younger stepbrother looked at the 8ft beast of a man barely fitting in the tiny bathroom. James’ cock throbbed in his shorts.<br />
<br />
“Cl…Clayton?” he asked.<br />
<br />
Before Ethan could respond, James let out a moan as he hunched forwards. He leaned on the doorway and stuck his hips out, reaching behind him and grabbing his ass. Ethan, still in a daze, looked at his younger stepbrother and his eyes widened. James’ ass started to balloon in size in his shorts. It kept growing and growing, causing the wet fabric to audibly stretch. His thighs also widened and within seconds his shorts looked skintight.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, what’s happening?!” yelled James, “we gotta call an ambulance or something!”<br />
<br />
James took one look at his transformed stepbrother and ran towards his room, leaving a dripping trail of Ethan’s cum behind him. Ethan tried to run after him but had to slowly contort his body to get out of the bathroom. His ass grinded against the wet walls, and after a few seconds he got out and was able to stand up in his new body.<br />
<br />
Being 8ft tall was a whole new world for Ethan. He looked down at his physique and wiped the patches of cum off of him. He couldn’t help but run his hand down his abs, and he stared with delight at his member that was already starting to harden again. He then looked at the TV and saw Titano flex his biceps in the red spandex. Ethan did the same, and laughed to himself in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“I can’t fucking believe it. I’m Clayton fucking Elkes!”<br />
<br />
He would’ve admired his body for a lot longer if he didn’t hear moaning coming from his stepbrother’s room. He reached the door and tried to open it, but it was locked. He knocked on it vigorously with his large hands.<br />
<br />
“James! Open the door,” he said.<br />
<br />
James didn’t respond, instead the moans grew deeper in pitch, just like his. He pressed his ear against the door and heard the sounds of clothes ripping.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! This feels so GOOD!” yelled James, sounding more manly.<br />
<br />
Ethan knelt down and looked through the keyhole. He couldn’t make anything out, as James was just out of view. He tried to shift himself but almost tripped and fell; being 8ft tall needed some getting used to.<br />
<br />
Then, James walked into view. Or rather, a man wearing James’ clothes. He was tall, but not as tall as Ethan, and his body was covered in muscle. The orange shirt looked many sizes too small, and was barely able to contain two pecs that kept growing. Just below the boy’s tight waist and abs were a pair of shorts that were on the verge of shredding. A huge bulge swung between his legs, but it paled in comparison to his ass. The man had the biggest pair of round cheeks Ethan had ever seen, and were spilling out of his shorts. Just looking at them sent Ethan’s hormones raging, and it wasn’t long before his cock needed attention again. He could see the man still had James’ face, except it had more defined features. James buried his face in his hands as he slumped onto the bed, his new heavier weight breaking the frame.<br />
<br />
“James hold on! I’m coming in!” said Ethan as he got to his feet. He took a few steps back, and then rushed the door, ramming it with his massive body. The door gave out immediately, and Ethan flew into the room and onto the floor.<br />
<br />
James looked up with wide eyes and an open mouth. Ethan didn’t recognise his stepbrother anymore. His face had transformed completely into that of a sexy, handsome model with long blonde hair and big brown eyes. The stepbrothers didn’t recognise each other. As Ethan got to his feet, so did James. He looked up at his older stepbrother, who was about a foot taller than him. They stared for a moment, both breathing heavily and sweat pouring down their perfect bodies. They shared a moment of silence before James spoke with a different voice.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” he said, “it’s real. You’re really Clayton fucking Elkes.”<br />
<br />
“And you’re really Morgan fucking Fletcher,” said Ethan.<br />
<br />
“What? No I’m…”<br />
<br />
James stopped himself as he gazed into the mirror on his wardrobe. Morgan Fletcher in a tight shirt and shorts that looked more like speedos stared back. He rubbed his face and neck.<br />
<br />
“Wow, I am. Fuck I look amazing!” he said as he flexed his biceps. The bulge in his shorts throbbed, and he turned around to admire his new ass. He went to grab it but stopped himself.<br />
<br />
“What happened? What caused all of this?” asked James, still trying to hold on to some semblance of reason.<br />
<br />
Ethan, who had thrown any care to the wind and had fully embraced the pent-up feelings that flooded his mind, put a hand on James’ shoulder and squeezed. His cock gently rubbed against James’ ass. He reached another arm around to grab one of the boy’s pecs, and he leaned his mouth closer to his ear.<br />
<br />
“Who cares?” he whispered, “let’s have some fun.”<br />
<br />
James could feel the man’s hot breath against his skin, and he let out a deep breath as he closed his eyes. When he opened them, he looked at the reflection of Titano gently caressing his chest and smiled, the giant man’s hands slowly moving down to his shorts that were seconds away from bursting open. He reached behind him to grab the man’s foot-long cock just as Ethan moved to kiss him on the neck.<br />
<br />
The mirror quickly fogged up, and the pair slammed the bedroom door shut. Their loud moans drowned out the sounds of the TV which played the last few minutes of the show. On the screen proudly stood Titano and Bubble Boy, as the pair exchanged a wink before cutting to the credits.</p>
