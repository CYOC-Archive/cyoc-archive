<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To Mark, the rest of his classes was just as boring as the first. He had postponed his earlier thought about change to Aidan for the not eating change, but that would come later than. And if not today, then tomorrow. Now, instead of planning further for Aidan, he thought what he would make his annoying brother Chris do when he came home later. He had to sort his ideas a bit to not mix up various different results.<br />
Aidan also had a similar remaining time to his morning, the same difficulties about working with his stiff sock-gloves. Regularly, he rubbed his bib through his face to calm his nerves a bit, only to look disgusted for a second by the strong scent of piss it spread over his face, before hiding it to fool the others, not that they took any notice of it.<br />
Mark waited for Aidan when he finally left the building, not that they had scheduled to meet. Therefore, Aidan was surprised when Mark stood there waiting. “Hey Mark. Are you waiting for someone?” he asked him.<br />
Mark smiled at him. “I was waiting for you here, as I wanted to help you a bit.” He would make his next change now, and have his fun with Aidan on his way home for it.<br />
Aidan again looked surprised. “But weren´t your classes over an hour ago? You could have just come over later. And what help do you mean?” Aidan said, a bit confused about the whole thing. It wasn´t as Mark was his best friend, after all.<br />
Mark glanced around, and seeing the last of Aidan´s classmates were just leaving, he grinned. Perfect, they were alone now. “Oh, the usual. But I have to ask you, Aidan, can you walk normally without help?”<br />
Aidan, forced to both look at Mark for being called by his name, as well as to answer honestly, was now even more confused, but answered anyway: “Ye…” Like in their break, Mark didn´t let him finish, as that was exactly what he wanted to take away, so he stomped with his foot hard.<br />
A void opened inside Aidan´s head, as everything that was connected to walking was erased out of him. But Mark didn´t let him have time to notice, replacing the knowledge quickly. “No, you can´t walk around without help. Similar to a toddler, you can take a few steps, but without support you will fall over. The same goes for standing longer than a minute. So, you either look for a support to walk or stand, or you crawl around, right?”<br />
Aidan nodded to himself, as this statement was easily placed inside his mind and accepted as true. And just as he accepted it, he felt his knees starting to shake, as he was already standing longer than he could without support. Just as he started to drop forward, Mark caught his arms and helped him stay upright. With an evil grin, which Aidan couldn´t see at the moment, he said: “Now clear what help I meant? I wouldn´t want for you to have to crawl your whole way home, would I?” He hid his grin as Aidan turned to look at him.<br />
Aidan looked up at Mark, still being held to not drop, answering: “Thanks for catching me. And also, thanks that you are so helpful, Mark. It would take ages to get home while crawling. Maybe I need something to help me get around. Any ideas?”<br />
While they walked out and turned towards Aidan´s flat to start getting him home, Mark thought for a bit, or at least it looked like it. Mentally, he was laughing over Aidan. Not only was he helpless to stop Mark from taking more and more from him, but he even asked him for help. So, it took some time for him to finally answer, still supporting Aidan in his walking. “Well, I know you hate the idea, but maybe it would be easier to get a big stroller for you. It would be easier for you to move when your legs didn´t need to support your weight, just pulling you around. And it would make it easier for whoever is helping you, as they could just push you in the stroller instead of supporting your weight walking.”<br />
Aidan made a face next to him. “I know I have some characteristics similar to babies, but I´m not a baby, Mark. Being pushed around in a stroller would be embarrassing for me. And wouldn´t a bigger stroller have my legs to far up for them to pull me around? Are you suggesting I´m too heavy for you?”<br />
Mark laughed at that. “No, you aren´t too heavy, Aidan. It would just be easier. And I said I knew you hate it, but it´s the only thing that comes to me right now.” Maybe that should be his next course of action for Aidan, making him ride in a stroller. But not today, he would have more fun seeing him crawl around for a bit. And if he got it himself, well, Mark wouldn´t complain.<br />
It took longer than before to get home, not that Mark minded, having too much fun with Aidan´s situation. Reaching the flat, Mark stopped supporting Aidan, and he quickly was exhaust enough to drop down, crawling into the kitchen to get something drinkable made for himself. Mark knew Aidan had a mixer to liquefy his meal, so he wouldn´t need to act on that right now. He had plans to limit what Aidan would drink, but that also wouldn´t be good right now. Fun comes in stages with this.<br />
After Aidan had successfully made himself some curry, he started about half of it in the mixer to liquefy it for himself. As Mark didn´t want the rest, Aidan placed it inside the fridge. He could liquefy it later.<br />
While Mark waited for Aidan to finish his drink, he made a small adjustment to Aidan´s profile on the chronivac. While Aidan was limited to crawling if not helped, Mark made sure he wouldn´t hurt himself if he dropped down after standing.<br />
He also saved the last changes into the reset-trigger.<br />
Name: Aidan Starns<br />
“Reset to baby” – Aidan returns back into baby-mode<br />
Jeans are too tight – removing<br />
Underwear needs to be a diaper, including using it, appears unused to others<br />
Hate of being naked<br />
Always socks on hands, feet and cock, inside ass and mouth (pacifier) and around neck (bib)<br />
Further sock-rules:	<br />
 	Hands – new, masturbated the evening before, stiff after put on<br />
Feet – worn on hands before, masturbated in the morning, wet all day<br />
Cock – taken from left foot, extra absorbent<br />
Ass – taken from right foot, extra absorbent<br />
Sock-bib – from cock, remains wet to Aidan, likes to rub face with it<br />
Sock-pacifier – from ass, sucking on it, only removed to talk<br />
Loving colorful clothes, always wearing pants and shirts <br />
Always wears shoes, only taken off for bed<br />
Fooling everyone at not being disgusted by own habits<br />
Can´t eat, only drink, food needs to be liquefied to drink it<br />
Loves dessert in form of Mark´s cum, asks for it<br />
Can´t walk more than a few steps without support or stand longer than a minute, crawls the rest<br />
Won´t get hurt by dropping down to crawl<br />
<br />
Like he guessed, Aidan looked up a bit hopefully after finishing his drink, and he had to hide his grin, knowing where this would end. And he was right about it. Aidan took a minute before he was ready, but he asked, sounding shy about it: “Mark, do you mind if I get some dessert from you?”<br />
Mark waited a bit with his answer, so Aidan would think he thought about it first, before answering affirmative. Who wouldn´t want to get a blow job for free?<br />
The approach was the same as before, Aidan massaged Mark´s balls while he sucked him off, making Mark moan in pleasure. And Aidan was far too eager to get his dessert to let Mark wait long for release.<br />
When Aidan had swallowed the whole load, and Mark was slowly coming back down, it didn´t take him long before he went home, leaving Aidan alone. Finally, Aidan could look disgusted by his own habits, not that that stopped him from rubbing the bib over his face, sucking on the sock-pacifier or anything else.<br />
Before he went to bed later, Aidan removed his diaper, collected a new pair of socks and masturbated in both of them. Then he put them aside, returning the socks he wore the whole day on his cock and inside his ass to their places and wrapped a new diaper around them. He dropped his shoes at the foot of his bed before dropping into it, quickly falling asleep fully clothed, just like he always did.</p>
