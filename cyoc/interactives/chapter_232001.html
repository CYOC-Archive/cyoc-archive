<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>With all the characters (current, new and incoming). Its best to establish existing couples for reference. I hope I got them all. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘Wendy and Midnight wish to adopt Cassy. Ben and Lucy wish to adopt Cindy.’<br />
<br />
This was the first line he wrote down on a stylus with parchment he found in the barn. He deduced it was for taking inventory of the livestock. As they recently acquired a herd of cattle earlier in the day as a few stallions went hunting for the night&#39;s feast; Chris made a quick note of adding dairy farmers to the list for volunteers on the bulletin board. Not realizing that he was writing in the centaur script; a combination of ancient Greek and Roman lettering he continued his note taking for Centaur pairs and children.<br />
<br />
‘Chris and Amanda are adopting Maggie. June and Marcus have chosen to adopt Zack.’<br />
<br />
Adding those down after he request the second completed couple to assist Jenny and Zoey. He noticed Lighting helping up April after she changed. Noticing that April was now wearing Jenny’s blouse, as Lightning with a goofy grin on his face trotted off with the newest Centaur mare. Chris earlier noticed that when Ben was playing host to the children he had an eye on adopting the Chinese American child named Xing. He also notice him and Lucy also trotting off from the gathering; the head centaur stallion had a smile on his face as it could only mean that those two will soon be fully centaur in both body and mind. Chris also made a note for Lighting and April respectively.<br />
<br />
Chris is taken out of his note taking to see Steve talking to a mare by the name of Starlight. He watches as a child approaches Steve and Starlight; despite not trying to spy, Chris was able to gain snippets of their conversation. Noting the child saying dad to Steve and Steve nodding and say Jeremy to the boyscout; Chris jotted down the next line.<br />
‘Steve and Starlight; Jeremey is Steve’s son.’<br />
‘Snow and Luke wish to adopt Tim.’<br />
<br />
‘Establish/assumed couples<br />
Midnight + Wendy<br />
Marcus + June<br />
Lightning + April<br />
Aiko + Helios<br />
Fred + May<br />
Chris + Amanda<br />
Zoey + Pegasus<br />
Jenny + Sandy<br />
Ben + Lucy<br />
Snow + Luke<br />
Daisy + Bolt<br />
More to come...<br />
<br />
Children/Foals<br />
Girls: Soon to be centaur fillies and ages.<br />
Maggie -13 (adopted); Cindy - 13 (adopted); Cassie - 14 (adopted); Beth - 15; Eve - 15; Kyra - 16.<br />
<br />
Boys: Soon to be centaur colts and ages.<br />
Tim - 13 (adopted); Jeremy - 14 (son of Scoutmaster Steve); Zack -14 (adopted); Adam - 14; Malcom - 15; Xing  - 16 (adopted?).’<br />
<br />
After writing all that down, it was then that Chris noticed he was writing in a language that was now natural to his new Centaur self. He worried slightly as he knew some will still be unable to read the Centaur script until they mate with their partners; completing their transformation into their new tauric selves. Chris smiles as he realizes that his and Amanda’s team will be fully change by tonight and will be literate in the new yet ancient language they will instinctively know.<br />
<br />
“Hello, we only talked briefly this early morning.”<br />
Chris turns around to see one of the Den mothers approaching him. Remembering it was Jessica, he noticed she removed the pins in the hair bun allowing her auburn hair to cascade down to the middle of her back. Like the others, she had a mane already forming on her back and her ears were pointed; soon to be more equine.<br />
“If I may ask,” Jessica noticing the parchment; “what are you doing?”<br />
“I’d be a poor leader of this Haras,” Chris answering instinctively: “if I didn’t take a proper census of our herd brothers and sisters.”<br />
“The lettering is bizarre,” Jessica looking at the parchment; recognizing a few symbols, some of them Greek symbols used in college fraternities, yet she couldn’t understand it.”<br />
“It’s in Centaur script,” Chris not trying to be discreet or deceitful; “you will soon understand it after you are…”<br />
“I know,” Jessica interrupting the stallion as she waved him off; “once you are Centaur in both body and mind. I got an earful of that from Lucy as well as both Bolt and Daisy. I’m sorry for cutting you off,” Jessica worried if she offended her host; “but its running late and the children should be getting to bed.”<br />
“Ah,” Chris nodding; “I take it you are feeling tired as well. This is to be expected as the days here last longer than Earth. Don’t ask me how I know,” Chris stating; “but if you insist I believe its part of the knowledge you instinctively learn after mating. The days here are 30 hours long. A year here is roughly 400 days. It is roughly the middle of the spring season and the moons will start waning after tonight. A lunar cycle is 16 days.” <br />
<br />
Chris paused as even he was surprised at how he just knew all of that despite only mating a few hours prior.<br />
“I believe that Epona will want my remaining companions to change before you, Sarah, Steve and Deputy Jackson change. Once Zoey and Jenny change along with my former steed Sandy and Zoey’s steed Pegasus; we will send the children to bed. Epona will ensure they sleep soundly so they do not wake up in pain or discomfort as they change.”<br />
“And the horses we rode in on,” Jessica rolling her eyes at having to utter that old chestnut.”<br />
“Two of the stallions will become mares as they change along with deputy Jackson’s punishment to becoming a mare,” Chris reiterating Epona’s will in wanting and equal number of stallion’s and mares. “If I may ask,” Chris offering a smile; “is there a stallion you are starting to fancy? I only ask because those feeling may be of Epona’s doing and it’s her subtle way to get you two together before you change.”<br />
<br />
That last part made Jessica blush as she couldn’t deny the fact that she did feel a stirring towards a jet black stallion with a single white beauty mark on his right flank.<br />
“There is one,” Chris picking up on Jessica’s body language; “go and talk to him. Trust that Epona only wants to make you happy in your new life.” Chris places a hand on the Den mother’s shoulder in comfort and offering a fatherly like nod in encouragement. Removing his hand from her shoulder he walks towards Helios who was biting into an apple he was holding in his new hand. The new centaur stallion was eating seconds to fill his second belly and to help recover energy after his transformation. Giving his fellow herd brother and friendly nod, he notices both Amanda and Aiko talking. Worried that the conversation they are havingis about to get heated; he was surprised to her Aiko offering Amanda and apology for her rude behavior and hostile attitude for taking Chris away from her.<br />
<br />
“It’s clear I made no secret that I had feelings for him,” Aiko doing her best to remain stoic; “but I truly felt hurt when he chose you over me because of some secret tryst you two had.”<br />
“I’m sorry you feel that way,” Amanda seeing her fellow herd sister starting tearing up; “it was never my intention to hurt you or anyone.”<br />
“I now realize that,” Aiko taking a heavy breath; “I felt shattered after you and Chris announced your mating just by walking with a goofy smile. If it wasn’t for Helios,” Aiko starting to tear up; “I’m not sure I would have done something I would likely regret.”<br />
“Oh Aiko,” Amanda giving her fellow herd sister; a loving embrace as she comforts the Japanese American with her equine half of that of a shire horse. “It’s alright,” Amanda also tearing up; “Love makes us do crazy things. Sometimes stupid things,” Amanda letting the centaur mare go; “what can I do to help you heal?”<br />
“Only Helios’s impressive shaft can do that,” Aiko casting a glance at the tanned mustang centaur with a Mediterranean bronze complexion to go with his blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair. “But if there is a chance,” Aiko taking a breath; “Helios and I would like to adopt a future centaur foal.”<br />
<br />
Chris thought that was his cue to join when his equine like ears picked up a disturbance. Turning his head he noticed Zoey naked from the waist down; displaying her womanhood with no fear or shame in her stance. Looking up at the sky she shouted; “Goddess Epona, if you can hear me, please turn me into a member of this Haras. I am ready to begin my new life as a centaur mare and as a mate for Pegasus.”<br />
Chris saw all the children as well as Sarah, Jessica and Steve turn to see Zoey’s statement in a state of partial undress. He always knew Zoey was a bit of a wild card when it came to conformity; he never expected his equestrian team mate to be one to make a spectacle. He and everyone else stood in silence, waiting for Epona’s response.</p>
