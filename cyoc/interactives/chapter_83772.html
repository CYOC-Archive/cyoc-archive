<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave and Jodie marched quickly towards Jenny’s cube, Jodie kept whooping under her breath, Dave couldn’t help but smile at the definite and noticeable spring this turn of events had put in the woman’s step.<br />
<br />
As they rounded the corner they saw Alice leaning against a column near to Jenny’s desk. She was clearly waiting for Dave before making her next move. Filing in behind Dave and Jodie as they walked, Alice gave Dave a pat on the shoulder and asked, “Ready to stick the bitch?” <br />
<br />
Dave nodded and smiled as the quartet reached Jenny’s cubical and stopped.<br />
<br />
Dave always had to take a moment to reaffirm himself in Jenny’s presence, the girl was stunning, a few years out of college but with a lithe physique, large, firm breasts and legs that made every man in the office bite the back of their hand. Her sparkling blue eyes narrowed in suspicion when the three strode purposefully to her desk.<br />
<br />
“What do you want?” Jenny asked incredulously, re-binding files on her desk.<br />
<br />
“Contract renewal” Alice said pointedly.<br />
<br />
“I’m not due for a contract renewal until next year” she said dismissively, opening a drawer next to her desk, “besides that doesn’t take three of you and I’m very busy” she slammed the drawer closed and turned back to her computer.<br />
<br />
“Actually, we have reason to discuss new terms with you” Alice said, her voice full of venomous sweetness, as Dave dropped the contract, complete with the new dress code onto her desk.<br />
Jenny quickly glanced over at it, “What reasons? You can’t be serious … wait is that the joke memo…” Jenny scanned it quickly, Dave was always impressed and jealous of her legal mind, she could run through contracts at lightning speed. The damn girl had everything, looks and brains, which Dave reasoned made her quite easy to resent, and explained why no one in the office seemed at all bothered by what looked like a firing team marching to her desk.<br />
<br />
“Ok, very funny!” Jenny snarled, pushing the contract back across the desk to Dave. “You honestly think I’d fool for that? Again? How stupid do you thi-”<br />
<br />
At that moment James rounded the corner of the cubicle to stand beside Dave, prompting Jenny to jump out of her seat. “Mr Burchess!” She said in surprise, Dave noted how her face had softened slightly, she looked a little worried by the appearance of the head of legal.<br />
<br />
“Ms Mahony” James said courteously, motioning her her to sit back down.<br />
<br />
“What, er…. What can I do for you?” She asked, giving the other three a sideways glance.<br />
<br />
James placed a file he was carrying on the desk before continuing, “Ms Mahony you are aware of the ‘three strikes and you’re out’ policy that we operate here at Mathison & Sweiber Associates?”<br />
<br />
The young woman sat nervously in her chair, “Yes Mr Burchess I am…”<br />
<br />
“And tell me…” James started, opening the file he had placed on the desk slowly, turning it around so that Jenny could read it, she eyed it nervously, noting that it was her own personal record. “… how did you get on at our other regional office?”<br />
<br />
Jenny’s face dropped, “I… I wasn’t compatible with the corporate structure in those two locations Mr Burchess… I’m much happier here…”<br />
<br />
James coughed, and Dave recognised his lawyer voice, “Ms Mahony, you are aware of the terms of your employment requiring that a colleagues position be tenable for review following  a matter of personal conflict or colleague complaint?”<br />
<br />
Jenny turned back to the four with widened eyes, “You bastard Dave! It was only a prank! Mr Burchess you can’t fire me for that!”<br />
<br />
James turned to Dave and then calmly back to Jenny, “Ms Mahony, the complaint was not filed by Mr Bahner, I assure you.”<br />
<br />
Jenny looked at James in disbelief before he produced a stack of new papers and dropped them on top of Jenny’s personal record. “Ms Mahony, following todays rather unnecessary outburst I have received 32 personal disagreement reports from members of staff in this office. Your attitude following this ‘prank’ incident led to an outbursts that disturbed 32 members of staff enough for them to formally report you, and countless others that are yet to do so”<br />
<br />
Jenny sat in shocked silence, eyeing the sheets of paper, frozen in place by shock, all the evidence was screaming at her that she was getting fired.<br />
<br />
“You were on your last strike already Ms Mahony and your behaviour today gives me cause to fire you 18 times over!”<br />
<br />
Jenny’s demeanour had completely changed, in less than a minute. Gone was her steely resolve, now she was begging for her job. All around the cubicle curious employees listened and watched surreptitiously. <br />
<br />
“Please Mr Burchess, there were extenuating circumstances… the prank memo…” Jenny began before James sharply cut her off.<br />
<br />
“A memo you fell for, were angered by so much that it drove you to promptly take out this anger on every member of staff in your way”<br />
<br />
“Please, don’t fire me” Jenny said desperately, Dave felt a twinge of remorse? Guilt? The ice queen demeanour was gone; she looked like a scared teenager under James’ tirade.<br />
<br />
“It’s them!” Jenny said desperately, pointing at Dave Jodie and Alice, “See? They’re tormenting me! They bought another copy of that damn memo!” She said, holding up the contract Dave had given her moments before.<br />
<br />
“Actually Ms Mahony, that’s the genuine contract renewal for you to remain with this firm” Alice said politely.<br />
<br />
“What?!” Jenny snapped in shock, looking over at Alice with wide eyes before she realised that James was also looking at her with the same expression.<br />
<br />
“You can’t be serious…” Jenny said gasping quietly, “This includes the joke memo!”<br />
<br />
“Yes it does” Alice said with a smile, “The dress code outlined would be part of your official employment terms with this firm”<br />
<br />
Jenny looked at her incredulously, “That’s not legal…” she gasped.<br />
<br />
James tilted his head like he was evaluating her point, “Maybe not, but this pile of files says we have a serious case against you for unprofessional conduct. I have reviewed all the evidence of your work here and I do believe we have a file prepared for the withdrawal of your degree…”<br />
<br />
Jenny looked down at the contract and then back up at James, “Mr Burchess… p-p-please… reconsider…”<br />
<br />
James smiled politely, “I assure you Ms Mahony you are free to be fired at any time. I say ‘be fired’ over ‘quit’ because any attempt to resign we would have to officially lodge as a firing on disciplinary grounds. Now after leaving of course, you’d understand that your degree would most certainly be declared null and void. Then you would remember that this firm has regional offices all over the world with contacts everywhere; the chances of you ever seeing yourself employed at any law firm anywhere would be nil. Our subsidiary companies would also never employ you, nor would our clients or any of their clients either. Perhaps you could find a small bar in the middle of nowhere that might employ you?”<br />
<br />
Jenny gulped as James continued,<br />
<br />
“In truth Ms Mahony it would do me no greater pleasure than to see you leave this firm and I can assure you that firing you is something I am still quite actively searching for an excuse to do. However, David here, agreed to aid in some rehabilitation for you, under the specified terms that have been ratified with HR in your new contract”<br />
<br />
Jenny was visibly trembling with embarrassment and confusion. Alice pulled the new contract back across the desk in front of Jenny and started flicking through it, pointing out key points.<br />
“You would become Mr Bahner’s personal assistant and your salary will be accordingly reduced to match your employment level, outlined in section 2. You will be required to adhere to the employee behavioural guidelines and dress code outlined in section 3. Your employment rights would remain the same and you would keep your pension, medical cover and company car.” Alice smiled a venomous smile, “it really is a great deal”<br />
<br />
Jenny, looked up at Dave desperately, then at Alice’s sweet but cruel face, Mr Burchess’ stern expression pointed her straight back to the contract. Now she knew why Jodie was here, the bitch just wanted to watch.<br />
<br />
“I don’t have a choice do I” Jenny mumbled weakly, taking the pen that Alice proffered to her and signing the bottom line of the contract. Alice quickly picked up the contract and walked away, ready to file it with HR, giving Dave a mischievous smile as she turned.<br />
<br />
“Excellent” James said, his demeanour suddenly snapping back and becoming far more jovial again. “Dave I’ll leave Ms Mahony in your expert hands, I understand there is the matter of the new dress code which I can see is definitely already being flouted”<br />
<br />
With that he turned on his heal, taking the papers he had placed on Jenny’s desk with him.<br />
<br />
Dave turned to Jenny, and for the first time in the whole exchange he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Ms Mahony, I’m afraid you are not adhering to the terms of your contract…”</p>
