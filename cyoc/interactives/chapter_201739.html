<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clyde for his part spent the rest of his day at school morose, and even his girlfriend picked up on it. She asked him twice at his next class, and another time as the school day ended why he was in such a mood. Clyde for his part just smiled awkwardly as could be and shook his head. &quot;No...no, I&#39;m not in any particular mood,&quot; he said trying to defuse the situation, &quot;Just...kinda wondering about something. I&#39;m trying to figure something out, and I dunno what to make of it.&quot; With that, his girlfriend just kissed his cheek, said he was being weird, and off she went to chat with her friends.<br />
<br />
And Clyde for his part headed off to try and find some hint, any hint, about what was going on with Roy.<br />
<br />
Could it perhaps be his diet? Was someone slipping something into his food, making him behave differently due to some form of chemical alteration to his biome? Could there be something on his clothes, or maybe he was trying out some fucked up little pill or smoke at a friend&#39;s party? &quot;It just does not add up...&quot; And what else did not add up?<br />
<br />
Zeke&#39;s behavior. Zeke&#39;s behavior really didn&#39;t add up. He knew Zeke and Roy never saw eye to eye. And they didn&#39;t exactly socialize a lot outside the study sessions. But these days it seemed like Clyde saw Zeke around more than he usually did. Maybe it was just Zeke moving around the campus a bit, but the sheer number of times he saw the guy made the blond jock more than a little nervous. Was he being observed? Did Zeke really know---know all that there was to know about him and Roy?<br />
<br />
He remembered that time in the locker room. The blow job, the mess on Clyde&#39;s face, and the clean up. He remembered Zeke showing up, acting like he was just walking around and calling out to him. Clyde&#39;s suspicions alighted, he decided to try and log all the times he saw Zeke around. Confront him with it later, or go to the principal or something with all the information. It wouldn&#39;t look good to any of the scouts for the major schools if Clyde went around beating up his teammates for anything. <br />
<br />
He needed to handle this...professionally.<br />
<br />
But Clyde&#39;s eyes just about bugged out of his head when he saw Roy next, right when he was thinking of trying to handle things. Roy looked thinner at the gut, beaming as he swaggered through the school - that unshakable confidence still rippling through him even as his face looked the slightest bit thinner, and a bit...prettier. Even his hair seemed a little wavier, with a slight curl at the end. Roy&#39;s muscles remaining as they were, this gave him a look that it seemed he quite enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Taking Clyde&#39;s stare as a statement of interest, Roy immediately walked up to him, flipped his shirt up, and showed off his new acquisition. Situated where Clyde had known - known! - there had been a gut earlier, Roy happily showed off a tight, toned six pack. There was some vestige of it - the abs pushing out a little bit - but the abdomen was far more tight and the obliques showed to a degree Clyde had never seen on Roy.<br />
<br />
A more conventionally attractive look to be sure. The jowls Roy usually had due to the excess weight he carried around were mostly gone. Clyde - if he&#39;d been anyone else - might&#39;ve been keen to enjoy the sight. Roy stated, &quot;Already admiring my abs, I see. I figure you deserve a direct show of the goods!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you uh...&quot; Clyde stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speechless at how good they look, eh? Don&#39;t blame you!&quot; Roy flexed his abs, grinning and running his hand over them. Provocation evident in his coy little smile, and the way his hand traveled. Clyde both wanted to figure out what the fuck ever happened, and wanted to touch Roy&#39;s new goods...on top of other things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speechless is a good word for it,&quot; Clyde responded, &quot;You didn&#39;t have those this morning. Or this afternoon. How&#39;d---how in the hell did this---!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have utterly no idea,&quot; Roy shrugged his shoulders, but evidently he&#39;d rationalized it all away in the moment, &quot;I just saw I had these sick six pack abs during my last period and---I won&#39;t deny. I was worried at first. But fuck, they look so hot on me. I couldn&#39;t really help it! I loved it.&quot; Roy brought a hand around Clyde&#39;s shoulders. &quot;We should get going. School is out after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even gonna try and figure out why you&#39;re trimming weight like this?&quot; Clyde asked in a wry tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not when I&#39;m feeling THIS good!&quot; Roy beamed, and it occurred to Clyde that whereas Roy usually was sullen, brooding, and pushed Clyde around a bit, now he was...he seemed happy. Like he was honestly having a good time, and didn&#39;t seem so high strung. Maybe, Clyde thought to himself, he should just wait it out and see what happened. After all, Roy was still Roy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Clyde smiled, still deciding he was going to look into what was going on...but figuring he could just for now enjoy the time he had with Roy, &quot;Let&#39;s just go then. You&#39;re feeling good, that&#39;s what matters I guess. If it hurt, you&#39;d tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro!&quot; Roy released Clyde from the side hug, and led the way out toward Roy&#39;s car. The dark haired jock also seemed to have a bit of something else going on that made Clyde feel distinctly interested in where this was going. That ass...! The young man grinned. Roy&#39;s ass was usually plump, shaped by his excess weight, and not exactly what Clyde looked at with him. But today it seemed Roy&#39;s ass was more of a bubble butt, forming a prominent shape in his jeans that Clyde could now appreciate so readily.<br />
<br />
As they walked out to the car, Clyde noted that Roy kept giving him these glances over his shoulder. It kind of confused the currently smaller man, making him wonder what was going on. As they got to the car and Roy fit his key into the ignition, both looked around the area. People were on their way home, and nobody was left loitering around the parking lot any more. Anyone who still required their parents or other guardians to pick them up was long gone by this point.<br />
<br />
And nobody was on the look out for a pair of jocks whose relationship was significantly more than what one might assume from &quot;just a pair of bros&quot;. As soon as they were done looking around though, Roy surprised Clyde by making the first move...and not in his usual way. Roy drew Clyde into a kiss as soon as they were in the car, an eager and passionate one that made the blond gulp - his cock immediately stirring. Roy soon enough put a hand around the back of Clyde&#39;s head, more eagerly kissing him, pressing their mouths together. Roy&#39;s other hand gripped Clyde&#39;s shoulder, a heavy blush settling on the larger jock as he did this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew...man you&#39;re a great kisser, Clyde,&quot; Roy stated after they separated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...never really got that tender with me before...&quot; Clyde caught his breath and sat there. His manhood making a substantial impression through his jeans, and his hand twitching. He wanted to make the next move on Roy so badly, but they were still just out there. Parked in the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to take care of that for you, Clyde?&quot; Roy asked eagerly, looking at Clyde&#39;s bulge. The blond jock realized what Roy was offering, definitely not something Roy often did. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re uh, offering to give me a hand?&quot; Clyde asked, not wanting to assume. Given how Roy was usually. And that would&#39;ve been an accurate assumption literally any other day. Or even any hour other than this one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Roy teased, looking at Clyde&#39;s needy expression and the fine impression in that denim, &quot;I could do it when we get back to my place, and we could do some more stuff there. Or I could just give you a hand job right here and now - and then once we get back to my place, you do that thing with your mouth on me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde actively considered what to do. <br />
<br />
The idea of finally having sexual relations with Roy in such proximity, in such a daring location, despite their usual secrecy...? It was a buzzing pulse of arousal right through Clyde&#39;s body. The knowledge that yes, he should not do this under any circumstance. That it might put to ruin all his carefully laid public perception...but at the same time. This was Roy offering to please him, do things for him without Clyde doing something for him first.<br />
<br />
It was a rare thing, and Clyde really didn&#39;t want to have Roy pull back later and withdraw the offer - if there was ever any chance of it. The blond jock decided...</p>
