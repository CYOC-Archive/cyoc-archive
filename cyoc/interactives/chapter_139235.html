<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her lower jaw extending, and her upper jaw and nose following suit, April stopped every so often to spit something out of her mouth that either clicked onto the kitchen floor and vanished shortly afterward or disappeared before it hit the linoleum. Oblivious to the fact that it was her human teeth, and that they were being replaced by the sharp teeth of a fox, which helped her to rip at the meat and crunch up the bones, April struggled to remember why it was she had come downstairs. Smelling the cool air coming through the open door, she considered it might have been to go outside.<br />
<br />
The scent of raw meat and blood reaching her now black nose, which was growing whiskers, she toyed with the idea that it might have been to get something eat. Perturbed by the blank spots in her mind, she paused and leerily peered about. Smelling humans and other odours that bothered her, she yipped and thought, &quot;Can&#39;t be helped. Got to figure out a way to undo the curse,&quot; and turning her attention back to the chicken, she gnawed and cracked a couple bones, thinking.<br />
<br />
After a bit, her thoughts fragmented and not making much sense, as she found herself wanting to do stuff that didn&#39;t make sense, like make a den for herself, April propelled herself upward so that her hands rested on a shelf. Spotting the plate of raw chicken, she extended her neck and pulled a particularly large piece of the plate and with a plot, it joined the other pieces on the floor. Dropping back to all fours, April tried to reason out what was happening. Telling herself, &quot;You have a penis and testicles. You shouldn&#39;t have those. Your pubic hair has spread and turned an add colour. These things aren&#39;t normal. So, why and how do you undo such things,&quot; she stopped and stared around at the dark house, unaware that her transformation had gone even further than she realised and the, except for her hands and feet, she looked like a rather large red fox.<br />
<br />
The idea of needing a mate coming to mind, April briefly thought that a vixen to produce a litter of kits would help her, but then, realising what she&#39;d just thought, she back away from the raw meat and glanced around the kitchen. Yipping out, &quot;No. Not a mate,&quot; and spying where the telephone was sitting on the island section of the counter, she barked out, &quot;Friends, not mate. Bets. Chastity. Diane,&quot; before stalking with a low-to-the ground posture across the kitchen and over to the counter.<br />
<br />
Confused as to why it seemed so much higher, she uttered what she thought sound like a horrid noise. Alarmed by what she was hearing, April tried to tell herself, &quot;One thing at a time,&quot; but only managed to make more noises that were nowhere near words.<br />
<br />
Upset by this, wanting know what she&#39;d done to be cursed with an inability to speak and boy parts, she skulked over to a nearby chair. Launching herself upward, she struggled a moment to pull herself up onto it, discovering as she did that at some point she&#39;d lost the her capability to walk about on two legs. Wanting to scream and cry, but terrified by what sort of noises she&#39;d end up making, April sniffed and pulled herself up onto the chair. Looking to the counter, which was a fair hop from where she sat, April was about to leap over to it when suddenly a harsh noise erupted and unable to stop herself, she backpedaled. Crashing to the kitchen floor, she started to turn to flee, even as she heard the answering machine kick over, April started to run toward the back door, but managed to gain some control and stop herself.<br />
<br />
From the machine, as she turned slowly, cautiously, away from the open back door, which her animal mind insisted was were there was safety, she peered in the direction of the phone. Realising that the noise she&#39;d heard was the machine picking up, she listened with mild curiosity as some deep voice man came on. Unable to understand what he was saying at first, she found it odd that, after some bit, he started mooing like a cow before the phone call abruptly terminated in a series of clunks and clicks. Conflicted, thinking that it might have been a prank call, April wondered why she couldn&#39;t understood what was being said and why the called had lapsed into making barnyard noises. Having no answer, she struggled for a moment, as the animal part of her brain, which was getting stronger, wanted to flee, before finally managing to recall that she wanted to call one of her mate. Realising what she had just thought, she yipped and fought against the basic instincts and after a couple minutes managed to force herself to recall she&#39;d been cursed and needed to call someone.<br />
<br />
Unsure who, but sure that they were important and had been with her for some time in a special capacity, April cast one more glance at the open door. Liking the smell of the outdoors wafting inward, she almost ran out. But, at the last minute, she turned away, with some difficulty, and skulked back across the kitchen. Coming to the island, she located the chair and once again pulled herself up onto it, her feet morphing into black-fur-covered paws, giving her somewhat of a better purchase as she did so. Peering at the counter, scared that the noise would come again, she balked at the idea of jumping over. But, reminding herself that she needed to talk to someone, forgetting completely that she no longer could utter human words, she watched the counter for a bit longer before leaping over to it.<br />
<br />
Her landing not exactly perfect, she scrabbled for a moment to gain a decent purchase on the slick surface. When she finally achieved that, she turned to the phone and taking a tentative step, a pinching sensation in her hands as they started to transform into paws, April lowered herself warily and crawled-walked across the short space. Nosing the phone, almost to dare it make a noise, she eventually relaxed a little before reaching out what she thought was a hand to pick up the receiver. Taking a step forward as she did so, her left front paw hit the play button on the answering machine.<br />
<br />
Abruptly, the silence was broken by the words, &quot;One new message,&quot; and not understanding what they meant, scared beyond reason, April turned and tried to scrabble away. Getting tangled up in the telephone cord, she barked out loud. Thinking the animal part of her mind had been right, she gave herself over to it, thinking it would only be until she could calm herself, she launched herself off the counter, yanking the phone and machine along with her. Crashing to the floor, the fox tried to untangle the cord that was hindering his movement and, failing to do that, he tore across the kitchen and out the back door, the phone and answering machine finally coming lose halfway across the back yard.<br />
<br />

<br />
A cloud of pale blue smoke spreading over his head, the man stared intently at what he was seeing as the spell went off. Finding the answer he had been seeking, understanding why his spell had effected two others, he sighed. Wiping the sweat that was dripping off his brow, as the spell had been difficult to cast, it was rather warm now that it had been enacted, he wondered what he could do to possibly correct it. A sudden loud cracking noise distracting him, he glanced in the direction, thinking the noise had come from the room with the statues.<br />
<br />
No longer thinking the spell that had effected the others to be a bonus, understanding truly what had happened, he stood and waddled through the house. Coming to the room with the statues, four to represent his sisters, he peered in. A suspicion on what he&#39;d see, he grinned when he was confronted by a pleasing sight. Turning away, he hurried as fast as his girth would allow him and peering into the basin of water, he waited a moment before the images of a four animals and two humans appeared.</p>
