<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two sat on the bed in silence for quite a while - contemplating past, future and present. They considered both the lives of a young man and mother as well as a wife and husband. The lives they lived and the lives held in memory and instinct. Two lives, where one had to be left almost entirely behind. The strain was immense given how little time they had to think things over, leading Olivia to answer her own question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...Okay, listen to me, bab-Rick,&quot; she cautioned, trying to embrace her more dominating male side to ease the stress a bit. &quot;Right now, I&#39;m still not sure exactly what we should do, but the others are waiting on us. We&#39;ll change, go down, and figure things out later. Without them knowing about this. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another bout of silence overtook the two before Rick quivered a soft &#39;okay&#39; back. He had to actively stop himself from adding one of the couple&#39;s many pet names at the end, his mind stuck between worlds - especially given the near slip of the tongue Olivia just had alongside the rather...intense session they just had. A look at Olivia&#39;s half erect cock indicated the feeling was mutual.<br />
<br />
The former woman looked as well, though not at her dick. Instead, she looked at Rick&#39;s pussy and breasts, and how they were still tingling from the...arousing circumstances. Their eyes lingered on each other&#39;s attractive forms. They leaned closer. They licked their lips. They...<br />
<br />
...snapped out of it by thinking of  their respective partners prior to all of this. They couldn&#39;t let their new sexual drives completely dictate things. These weren&#39;t their normal relationships! At the same time, however, their marriage was still certainly real and not to be ignored. Only time would tell which romantic feelings would remain intact. For now though, the conflicting feelings were enough to allow each to finally change clothes.<br />
<br />
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;What the poopy is taking them so long?&quot; Paul shouted with a loud huff, tapping his foot on the floor. Well, rather, he was trying to based on his normal instinct in impatient situations. The problem was Paula&#39;s legs and feet were way too small to touch the ground from the chair he was sitting on. <br />
<br />
Emily couldn&#39;t stop herself from letting out a loud chuckle. Normally when her dad got agitated she felt quite intimidated. His face would become stern, his voice deep and harsh, he would even shift his body to loom over who or whatever he was mad at. She always took him seriously, but she couldn&#39;t do that given his current state. His rough visage was replaced with a soft, adorable pout, his voice was high pitched and squeaky, his body was with much less mass much less height to tower over really anyone. The cherry on top was the swear filter the camera had placed on him, making angry swears turn into cute child-friendly comments. It was all so silly!<br />
<br />
Hearing her laugh directed Paul&#39;s attention to his daughter, giving her an even better view of his pouty face. Her chuckles grew louder, as much as she tried to stop herself. &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; he grumbled with a still high pitched tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Nothing, daddy...&quot; she answered, her giggles beginning to wind down. At the very least, that took the edge off a bit and eased her own annoyance about how long they were taking. She wasn&#39;t exactly comfortable in her own form either. Her lack of sizable breasts and a bra to support them was something she hadn&#39;t faced for many years. Her voice now contrasted Paul&#39;s in the complete opposite way - her being the more coarse of the two. Her body had way more arm and leg hair even at this relatively young age - disgusting. Her memories were muddled with her normal ones, and ones with Emile hanging out with guy friends talking about &#39;cute girls&#39;. Finally, and most uncomfortably, was her...privates changing. She didn&#39;t even want to linger on that more than she had to.<br />
<br />
Thankfully she didn&#39;t have to as her attention was directed towards Rick and Olivia walking down the stairs and towards them. The former had a loose, black blouse, while the ladder had a T-Shirt, and both with blue jeans. Given the two&#39;s sexual session took quite a while already, Rick had decided not to bother putting on a bra hoping &#39;her kids&#39; wouldn&#39;t notice. Even if they did, they could have simply given the excuse that while they spent that time trying to put the bra on it didn&#39;t end up working. Regardless he wasn&#39;t so indecent as to not put on underwear - choosing a pair of boxers like Olivia did since it was more comfortable for both; as much as Olivia was used to panties she was positive trying constantly keep her penis in them entirely would have felt awful.<br />
<br />
&quot;About time,&quot; Paul sighed seeing the two were finally downstairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Missed me...hon?&quot; Olivia asked with a strained smile, leaning down for a small hug as Rick sat next to Emily, who themselves gave a hug. <br />
<br />
Paul reciprocated the hug in turn, nearly crying thanks to some of Paula&#39;s emotions. Still, he wasn&#39;t entirely content just recognizing they were here, and rather felt the need to look at their expressions and demeanors. Especially things like that strained smile.  Given how his daughter&#39;s boyfriend was fucking his wife not half an hour ago (albeit due to the camera&#39;s reality changes, and not knowing of their most recent session), his masculinity and pride felt threatened and required attentiveness to maintain. Well, despite the former &#39;men&#39; now being &#39;women&#39;...and Paul still wearing incredibly feminine clothes compared to Rick...and Olivia now being the man of the house...<br />
<br />
That was all besides the point! He had to make sure nothing funny between those two was going on. The looks on their faces and how they walked seemed quite dour, but at the same time the two were occasionally glancing at each other even as they sat across the room. He didn&#39;t notice Rick wasn&#39;t wearing a bra, however, given he was too short to see it from above. Maybe they were just ashamed about what they had done when under the camera&#39;s influence? Maybe they felt this whole thing was awkward? Paul wasn&#39;t quite sure yet, and he wouldn&#39;t stop until he knew for absolute certain things were normal: Mommy and daddy being together. That was to say Olivia and Paul! N-Not Oliver and Rebecca like Paula wanted! &#39;Stupid Paula..stupid camera,&#39; he reflected, noting how his thoughts were more jumbled than before.<br />
<br />
He shook his head as Emily pulled out the camera. &quot;Alright. Now that we&#39;re all here and ready, who wants to go first?&quot;</p>
