<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Transgender Package&quot; Judy read and as she entered it she wondered if it was about making her kids feel trans, or making trans kids not feel trans like a hypnosis app or something. However on this digital world it seemed to simulate what would happen if her kids were the opposite sex. Judy didn&#39;t approve much of this much data but since it&#39;s available may as well take a look. She ignored everyone not in her family as she started with her little angel and saw what would happen if she...<br />
<br />
Jenny was at her little &quot;tea party&quot; with her friends as they drank juice and watched some videos on a tablet while cuddling their stuffed animals next to each other. Then Jenny felt a pressure in her panties as her hair got shorter, and... she felt odd. There was a comfortableness when she was a girl, but upon turning into a guy it felt like her heart was fluttering a bit more. It&#39;d only be maybe a few seconds... maybe a few minutes till the others noticed his shorter hair and changes<br />
<br />
&quot;Still a cutie&quot; Judy thought as she then went to Peter or soon to be Patricia~<br />
<br />
The little bros were at the pool in the backyard and splashing into the pool, getting out and trying to make the biggest splash. Currently they were all wet out on the patio arguing about who had the bigger splash when Peter grew an inch as his female body had undergone puberty a bit earlier... and the guys were staring at Peter who just grew a significant amount in front of their eyes and then... were staring at the cute girl in front of them. Her hair was still short, but styled a bit more her short were clinging to her now wider hips and slightly thicker thighs and... her small yet perky breasts glistening with water drops, nipples hard from the cold water out in the open... Peter blushed a bit as she looked down at her body and quickly dove into the water embarrassed as she started asking her &quot;bros&quot; to get her mom or older sister... <br />
<br />
&quot;Her body decided to be a little more precocious than his body eh?&quot; Judy mused as she went to Jeff her awkward middle son who was a bit too introverted. She could only imagine how he would&#39;ve turned out as a girl instead... And this chronivac could help with that<br />
<br />
Jeff was in the shower rinsing his hair out when he felt... it getting longer... Jeff took his head out of the water immediately even though there were some suds running down her... his... no it felt more right as her now... Her hair was covering her eyes with water also going down it, but Jeff parted her hair to see it was long enough that it was starting to cover her chest which was now growing larger. Jeff&#39;s hand relaxed to her thigh which felt nice and soft... Jeff would... No, Jeff turned off the shower as she tried to wring some of the water from her hair before drying with a towel... this was taking longer than Jeff would&#39;ve liked but at least her pajamas could... probably work for this body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lovely&quot; a word actually uttered from Judy&#39;s mouth as she wished Jeff actually was this Jenny. Kara had always been spunky, perhaps a bit too frisky, but this version felt Elegant to Judy. Sadly this was confined to this computer... speaking of Kara... Judy wondered if this version would end with her being a grandma already...<br />
<br />
Technically this version probably ended with Judy not becoming a grandma so soon as Judy had been changing in her closest to reveal her nude body to Greg who was VERY ready for what was happening, they groped each other for a bit till... Kara&#39;s perky breasts slipped from his fingers as they turned into pecks. They were laying on Kara&#39;s bed together as the already somewhat bi Kara turned into a bi Kevin, nice and fit, somewhat muscled, and carrying a nice package... Greg wasn&#39;t bi or gay though and this &quot;standoff&quot; of sorts was getting a bit more awkward as they were staring into each other&#39;s eyes. <br />
<br />
Disappointing was the word Judy would&#39;ve described male Kara... It wasn&#39;t unexpected, and the libido only going up slightly was... Judy wasn&#39;t sure how to describe her feeling as she compared the change from Jeff from the change that Kara had. They were both drastic as an entire sex change was but... Kara&#39;s stats felt like... Well Kara as a dude. Judy sighed for a bit as she figured she wouldn&#39;t touch her husband... that may be weird, but may as well looked at her own. &quot;STOP MESSING WITH THAT!&quot; came a somewhat familiar yet unfamiliar female voice as *click* went the soft clack of an enter key. An only semi-dry Jane was in the doorway as Judy saw the girl in her short lived fantasy and clutched her heart... as she noticed that her breasts were shrinking and... Her own panties were getting taught as her reproductive track was extending outside of her body. <br />
Judy looked down and asked &quot;So... that thing on your computer wasn&#39;t just virtual?&quot;<br />
Jeff shook her head as she said &quot;Nope, who else did you do that to?&quot;<br />
Judy knew that his husband was at work and... he was thankful he hadn&#39;t made an important meeting or something awkward... and then Judy had wondered how her other kids were doing...</p>
