<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon knew he should wait until at least the solution was made by Jannes for him to go out and enjoy his renewed youth. It was a question of delayed versus immediate gratification. Just a look at his reflection in the mirror both made Brandon fume a little bit more but also realize he was probably going to be very popular indeed. He pumped an arm and enjoyed the look of his flexed bicep. The dark skin tone even seemed to accentuate his build a bit...yeah, there was no way he was going to be able to stay home when he was feeling this good. Brandon for his part looked down at his manhood, still pushing up and out. He needed to get some relief for how horny he was feeling! It was just not doable, staying home.<br />
<br />
So Brandon went ahead and started looking around for something that&#39;d look good on him - or at least, the new him.<br />
<br />
The dress shirts he usually wore around were made for someone thickly muscled, but if anything Brandon was seeming better than he&#39;d ever been. So when he went ahead to try one of them on, he noted the back was stretched tight by his lats, and there was a definite impression at the front made by his abs and his pecs. He trailed his hand up his dress shirt, feeling the buttons pulled tight by his build and gasping in pleasure when his finger trailed on the dangling nerves of his nipples. &quot;Ohh man, I never had any of my girlfriends do nipple play with me before...miiight have to change things.&quot;<br />
<br />
The renewed man then went about putting on some tight jeans, all the better to accentuate his thickly muscled ass. He didn&#39;t know whether he wanted men, women or any combination thereof right now, though his fantasies were more muddled now. Brandon contemplated what this all meant even as he finished dressing up. He lightly slapped his own ass and grinned - tight, toned, and ready to make a show. Honestly he looked forward to letting go of his worries and having some fun tonight.<br />
<br />
Brandon started to head out and, despite the confusion of some of his valets, he was given the go-ahead to get one of his cars out and ready to go. He deliberately picked one of the less blatantly &quot;rich guy&quot; cars for some reason - he told himself he was just trying to keep a low profile. As he got everything ready, making sure to pack some condoms and money in case he needed it, he gave his reflection in the car mirror a grin. He saw someone he barely recognized, but Brandon told himself that sooner rather than later he was going to be back to who he should be.<br />
<br />
He was obviously himself, right? But then there was the fact it was becoming increasingly obvious Brandon was experiencing differences in his experiences. For some odd reason he was becoming more interested in men, and then there was the fact he was listening to rap, something the old Brandon would never have done. How good was it really to indulge in something that was not the &quot;real him&quot;?<br />
<br />
Considering that this was brought on definitely by Jannes&#39; serum, the fact he was going ahead...could it exacerbate things?<br />
<br />
No, Brandon thought. No matter what happens, I&#39;m still me, I&#39;m still Brandon Whyte. I may need to use a pseudonym tonight, but I&#39;m going to remain me throughout this.<br />
<br />
And Jannes had better come through with that cure for this strange change that had completely remolded Brandon...<br />
<br />
Before long, Brandon drove out, finding himself driving more boldly than usual, pushing the car and enjoying the speed. He didn&#39;t really know where he was going, just that he wanted to enjoy himself. He knew well enough though that there was a certain district that had a lot of fun places. And as he drove around, he happened to drive up to the street entering this district. He usually kept away, but tonight he was feeling like playing around there;<br />
<br />
The place was full of not just bars and clubs for the so inclined partying jocks and local hardbodies, but also inclusively enough numerous clubs directed at the gay and bisexual population. Brandon parked and bought a night&#39;s worth of parking, not even a problem for him. Looking around, Brandon near on immediately found himself looking at some people walking along.<br />
<br />
A young woman and a young man - the young woman was dressed in a white jacket, a red tank top underneath and light blue jeans, with a pair of white lace boots. She was obviously athletic and pretty, with long blond hair tied in a ponytail. She seemed made up pretty well, and Brandon couldn&#39;t help himself but want to make his approach even though he knew that she already had a date.<br />
<br />
And what a date it was! As much as Brandon desired the woman, the man was a tight, well toned and easily desirable young stud. His skin was milky and yet his muscled physique couldn&#39;t be denied. He had auburn brown hair and bright blue eyes. He dressed in a blue crop top, tight workout pants, and sneaker shoes, with a backwards baseball cap on his head.<br />
<br />
And they happened to be coming in Brandon&#39;s direction. He tried to keep walking, to make it obvious that he was not enrapt by their astonishing appearances. He would&#39;ve never assumed these two would be together like this. But it was undeniable. As Brandon walked by, lightly sweating, the young man seemed to whisper something to his date and they stopped. The young man turned and looked at Brandon, his voice stopping Brandon in his tracks, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re looking pretty good tonight. Cindy thought we might need to make it three for our night, and you&#39;ve got the kind of build we both like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon turned on his feet to look at the two of them, gulping and asking, &quot;The kind of build you like for...uhh, for what?&quot; Fuck he was feeling so nervous...<br />
<br />
The young man chuckled in response, crossing his arms in front of his chest, &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious? We&#39;re out here hitting up the party scene. Nobody really comes out here for anything but at night. I&#39;m Carlton, this is my girlfriend Cindy. We like hitting up the scene here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy elaborated, &quot;We usually find a date or two for the night. Carl&#39;s bisexual, and I like watching him dance - or more - with another man. Would you like to join up? You&#39;re really rocking a nice look, though you should pop that collar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon gulped, and looked the two of them over. For some reason the idea was really appealing to him right now. He approached and decided, he was going to go with it. He might as well. After all, Jannes WAS going to fix him up going forward. He might as well enjoy himself tonight. &quot;Alright. My name&#39;s Brandon... &quot; He felt the air on his neck and thought of the chills of a few months ago, &quot;Winters. Brandon Winters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Brandon Winters...&quot; Carlton started and walked over, opening a few of Brandon&#39;s buttons and showing off more of his body all the while pressing himself up against his muscled physique, &quot;Let&#39;s see what club we hit up first. See what happens later on...&quot;</p>
