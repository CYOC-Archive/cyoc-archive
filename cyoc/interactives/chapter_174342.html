<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When they arrived at the mansion, Elenor escorted all of them inside and directly over towards the training facilities. Her plan was to quickly throw a few levels into Jerry so their team can have its main attacker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, since we can now, I want us to use both of our sluttymon so that we can level up both at the same time&quot; instructed Elenor towards Alora. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so how are we determining who wins?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Easiest way is the first trainer to cum wins, so we will use that&quot; answered Elenor. Everyone but Scott was now participating, as only one of them needed to play. So to keep the game fair, even though both of them counted as the same trainer, one of them had to be the &quot;target&quot; for the battles. Plus Scott was their wildcard. Even when you felt he had it in the bag, he would somehow disappoint and vice versa.<br />
<br />
When the battle began, Alora told Jerry to just stand near Elenora, and Elenora told Nana and Erika to specifically do nothing, and to just let Noel handle everything. The XP gained from battling like this was small, but still more than enough for the early game leveling they needed. Once Alora came, winning the battle, Jerry leveled up and became Jane, the Slutty Policewoman. <br />
<br />
The costume also changed to fit her much better too. Her pencil skirt became a micro mini skirt which could almost cover over half of her ass cheeks, while fully exposing the sheer black thong she now wore. Her fishnet clad legs ended in a pair of 7&quot; black ballet ankle boots with locked pad locks, which Jane had found out that she had absolutely no issue walking in or simply being in. They were extremely comfortable according to her, almost as if they were her actual feet even.<br />
<br />
Her ample chest was held up by a strapless black push-up bra that didn&#39;t quite fully cover her nipples. The navy blue police uniform was open and only tied together underneath her boobs, making sure to not cover them at all, except for the slightest bit underneath them. She had the standard hat and sunglasses though, which went well with her wavy dark brown hair. Her skin also took on a nice full-body tan. 2 pairs of hand cuffs locked one of their sides on either wrist, leaving the other to remain open and dangling beneath.<br />
<br />
Her toolbelt now contained a riding crop, a pouch for 1 more pair of handcuffs, a pouch containing a ball gag, and 1 more pouch containing a roll of black bondage tape. In her holster, instead of the usual tazer or pistol, she had an 8&quot; black rubber, cock shaped dildo, with balls. Finally both of her ears and nipples became pierced, as well as her navel. <br />
<br />
Since they were inside, Jane took off her sunglasses and hung them from her front facing bra strap as natural as if it belonged there. Her overall height surprisingly still remained the same though, even with her heels pushing her up several inches. Her overall demeanor also changed, shifting from her fairly casual one to an unquestionably dominant  one which carried with it an aura of superiority. Everyone could tell that Jane was not the same person Jerry had been. <br />
<br />
However Noel in perticular was especially influenced, as her submissiveness kicked in finally finding its perfect complement. Just standing there next to Jane was making her extremely excited, as thoughts of being dominated by both her beloved Mistress/Girlfriend Alora and her teammate Jane, at the same time, filled her head. A perverted grin appeared on her face and her pussy became literally so wet that droplets were now beginning to drip down onto the floor, but besides form Erika, who kept quiet while giving Noel a warm look knowing exactly just how sexually excited the girl was, no one seemed to notice. So she walked over to her and whispered into her ear to keep it private. &quot;Girl, you really need to calm yourself down a bit as you are literally making a puddle. Don&#39;t you worry though, I am sure that they will both be all over you later. Maybe me and Nana were thinking of stopping by later and throwing ourselves a little sluttymon orgy. What do you think? Wanna join in?&quot; Erika didn&#39;t mean to do it, but her words had pushed Noel over the edge, as thoughts of now Nana and Erika dominating her were added to her daydream too, and made her finaly cum for the first time. <br />
<br />
Noel was now laying on her back panting, with a satisfied look on her face. She had to sit down since her outfit kept rubbing against her currently extra sensitive clit. According to Alora, when she had just leveled up from winning this last battle, she gained a passive ability which significantly hightened the sensitivity of anyone who made her cum for the next 5 minutes. And since she ultimatly made herself cum, even though Erika gave her the push, the passive targeted herself and applied. So now Noel&#39;s clit was so sensitive that even just a simple breeze made her nearly orgasm, which she actually already had done 7 more times since the first. Finally the passive ended, and Noel found that she could move her body again without cumming. Noel noted how her hair was also a bit longer too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lets take a break&quot; suggested Elenor, as she began making her way out of the room. Everyone quickly followed behind her as she lead them into one of the lounge rooms, which had an indoor pool and a hot tub in another room connecting dirrectly off of it.</p>
