<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Watching as the rich bitch drove off, Ric was a bit dumbfounded and still very horny. The burning need he had to lay down some serious pipe had not gone away, even if his member was still not up to its usual standard. <br />
<br />
Rather than continue to stand there, he decided to head back inside, thinking that a little bit of hand exercise might relive the  tension he felt.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to the gym jock, events elsewhere were occuring that would provide him a new partner...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
The screen of the tv went dark as its owner disgustedly turn off the progrsm she&#39;d been watching. The naked homophobia of Jack Burton had been bad enough, but Erin was really disgusted by his fianceé, Jessica Bling.  She was a living symbol of the patriarchy and its ceaseless oppression of women, particularly homosexual women.<br />
<br />
Moving over to her kitchen, the plain-looking lesbian continued to fume. Where did that breeder bitch get off acting like that in public? Erin could feel a rant coming on that would be great content for her YouTube channel. <br />
<br />
The flannel and jeans-clad dyke moved from the kitchen towards her living room where she&#39;d set up a green screen as a backdrop for her &#39;Woke Woman&#39; videos.  It took a bit of fiddling with the tech, but soon enough it was primed snd ready to go. Erin felt that familiar rush of horniness that she got right before any of her online rants. That sealed her fate, as the curse transmitted to her from the Burton/Bling presser was triggered.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Online, Erin&#39;s YouTube channel began to undergo its own change. It began with her earliest videos, as their content shifted away from diatribes on politics towards make-up tutorials. Her most popular rant transformed in a beginner lesson on how to pole dance...<br />
<br />
With each alteration of her content, the new subscriber count ticked upward, far out pacing the loss of her old followers...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Erin&#39;s transformation into a full-blown were-breeder began with the raggedy jeans she wore. There was a rip at the knees, as the upper part of the legs rolled themselves into non-existence, revealing her thighs. There material below began to thin, turning from blue denim to black cotton. Had she been wearing shoes, they&#39;d have been obliterated by the newly formed leg warmers like her socks were. A loop of cotton swept in under each of her feet, which cracked themselves a bit smaller as the toenails gained a splash of black polish. They looked like a dancer&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
To match her new feet, her now exposed legs began to swell with muscle and fat. Her thighs grew thicker, while her calves strengthened to better support her during her pole routines. All the while, her pale skin was giving way to a tan wave that flowed up. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Erin&#39;s undergarments  had fused with what remained of her jeans, becoming the beginnings of a lycra leotard, which slipped under the &#39;Pride&#39; tee she&#39;d been wearing. Her ass, in response both her thickening thighs and widening hip bones, swelled outwards, sucking the bottom of the leotard between two round and firm buttcheeks. This naturally caused the front of the outfit to pull tighter, giving her a definite camel toe, and caused a jolt of pleasure from her now moist pussy.<br />
<br />
This influx of sensation only added to the muddle Erin&#39;s mind had become. She&#39;d started out ready to rip into that Bling woman but now found herself focusing on Jack Burton and his hot bod. But that wasn&#39;t right, she thought, I&#39;m into women. That notion about her sexuality caused a sudden rush of anger, as if she hated the very  idea of being attracted to her own gender.  It didn&#39;t help that she was also feeling some envy at Jessica&#39;s stellar make-up...<br />
<br />
As the lesbian was coping with her mental transition from gay to straight, her body continued its own transformation. Her white t-shirt with &#39;Pride&#39; written in rainbow glitter was being twisted into a new form. White became grey as it shrank down to emphasize her chest. The prideful glitter fell away with a shimmer, revealing that her shirt now read &#39;SMEXY AS HELL&#39;, which a growing part of her just loved. And the bold white letters got pushed out further as her breasts expanded a few cups sizes. Below the impressive new rack, her abs gained definition as her core tightened up, but remained very flexible.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Back on her changing channel, her old banner that proclaimed her to be a &#39;WOKE WOMAN&#39; was fading away, replaced by a far more sultry one that declared she was now &#39;ERIKA EROTIKA&#39;.  Her subscriber count blew past 100k, and was getting closer to the magic one million mark.<br />
<br />
All the while, pole dance videos, fashion reviews and make-up tutorials replaced every single one of her angry rants...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
 <br />
Now came a monent of panic as Erin&#39;s mindset began to give way to Erika&#39;s. Her orientation completed its flip from homo to het, as her bitter hate of the patriarchy and its cis agenda was replaced by an exhibitionist&#39;s desire to be in the spotlight. After all, why was she such a hottie if she couldn&#39;t flaunt it for her fans, but especially for her hot male fans. <br />
<br />
She was disgusted by the mere idea that any of those dykey lesbos might be watching her vids, but could she really blame them? Her bod was truly outrageous.<br />
<br />
As Erika settled in the mental driver&#39;s seat, the final changes quickly completed themselves. Her flabby arms grew toned and tanned, even as rings and bracelets appeater. Her short nails grew long as black polish applied itself to them.<br />
<br />
Her short blonde buzzcut exploded into a long messy mass of ebony that reached to the small of her back, just as her spine popped above her tailbone. The result was her ample behind and bust both stood out more.<br />
<br />
Her hands reached out to grip the professional stripper pole that rose up from floor to ceiling. With a practiced ease, Erika slide up it and began to spin. With each rotation, her face changed. Lips plumping, chin tapering and cheeks rising. As the tan reached her forehead, her black eyeshadow and long lashes helped her dazzling blue eyes pop out more on the screen.<br />
<br />
Other changes washed over her apartment as various awards for pole dancing competitions appeared on the walls. Two play buttons, silver and gold, from YouTube settled into a place of pride behind where she was finishing up her routine for that day&#39;s video.<br />
<br />
Leaving the footage to render, Erika slid into some hawt pink sneakers and headed for the hallway. She was gonna grabs some eats before uploading the day&#39;s content.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
In the hallway, Ric fumbled for his keys as a total babe stepped out the apartment next to his. Seeing her, his still gay dick rose up pathetically. This chick was hot, hotter than his ex, Shari. Sensing a chance to get some and cement his new life, the gym jock grinned cockily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, babe. Do I know ya&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika smiled sexily, her eyes drinking in this hunk. She had gotten a bit worked up recording her vid, and needed a release.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. Wanna change that to definitely?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric licked his lips as he walked over to her. His arm snaked around her waist and gave her ass a squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;F&#39;yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two fell back into Ericka&#39;s place, where she was soon dancing around a different kind of pole. Unseen by the new coupling, the voice was pleased as its power grew with the sealing of Eric inside of Ric, and the birth of another were-breeder. <br />
<br />
Perhaps, it could see to other tasks now...</p>
