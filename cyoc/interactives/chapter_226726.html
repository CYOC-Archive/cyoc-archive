<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kenzia wanted nothing more than to stay at the mirror’s side and absorb her new and improved appearance. Moment by moment, the human she was before was becoming more of a distant memory. It was as if she had awakened from the dream that was her previous life, the details growing ever more hazy as the day wore on. Gathering herself, she pulled her ponytail of snowy hair into an intricate braid that better suited her regal Drow nature and left the bathroom to begin her new existence.<br />
<br />
And she promptly hissed in pain as the bright sun rays burned into her crimson eyes from the bedroom window. She trudged up to the blinds as quickly as she could and shut out the daylight.<br />
<br />
“Dreaded sunlight!” She cursed in her newfound elvish mother tongue. She now stood in the gloomy half-light of her room, only to find that she now saw in the dark as naturally as a human in the noonday sun. She cracked a half smile, feeling safe, protected by the cloak of shade hugging her naked frame.<br />
<br />
Just moments later her reverie was interrupted by a tapping on her door. <br />
“Kenzie?! You okay in there? I heard shouting!”<br />
<br />
Mary. Sweet, supportive Mary. Kenzia’s human memories may have been fading, but her image was still as clear and sharp as stained glass. She’d spent year in and year out, unlucky in love, and yet she had been there through it all. “Oh well”, she thought, could bemoan her past blindness later, this was the time for action.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m not sure. Think you could step inside? I hit my head and the light hurts, it could be a concussion.” Kenzia answered in a perfect affect of her previous english. <br />
<br />
She quickly stepped to the side as the light from the hallway entered her room, shrouding herself until she was ready to divulge her new form. She sighed in relief to find that the artificial electric light did not burn her retinas like the sun had done.<br />
<br />
“Kenzie? You’re worrying me a little. Should I call a doctor?” Mary asked as she stepped into the room, closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
“No, but you can do something else, come over here.” Kenzia replied as she stepped silently across the floor. Mary couldn’t make out much of her friend in the dark of the room, but she did seem different… taller maybe, and her hair a little lighter?<br />
<br />
“Wait Kenzie, aren’t you wearing anything? Go put something on and I’ll call an ambulance, you need help.”<br />
<br />
Kenzia stood a few steps from Mary now.<br />
<br />
“No, I don’t actually… Here, let me show you.” <br />
<br />
Kenzia waved her hand, and with a spark, three glimmering white orbs of light leapt from her fingers and illuminated the room in a pale glow. There stood Kenzia in all her glory, her unmarred ashen skin as soft and lustrous as silk, her long braid of white hair shining, her red eyes looking on Mary with a combination of admiration and desire.<br />
<br />
Mary covered her mouth as she was about to yelp in surprise. “Kenzie?!”<br />
<br />
“It’s Kenzia now, actually. But don’t fret, it’s still little old me. I apologize for the initial deception, but I doubt you’d have just accepted ‘come on in I’m just a gorgeous elven maiden now’, would you?”<br />
<br />
Kenzia smiled coquettishly as she observed the flush in Mary’s cheeks when she drew out the word “gorgeous.” <br />
<br />
“No- I guess not.”<br />
<br />
“No need for a doctor then, right?” Kenzia replied as she stepped forward, closing the final distance between them.<br />
<br />
“God no.” Mary gasped back, falling into the Drow’s waiting arms. The spell that had changed Kenzia was now working it’s way through her.<br />
<br />
Kenzia cradled the shorter woman with confidence, pulling her in with an arm around the smell of her back. She brushed a strand of auburn hair from Mary’s face and locked her in a hungry kiss. The years of complicated feelings shared between the two washing away in a cathartic tide. Mary squeezed closer, pressing herself into Kenzia’s ample bosom. The fabric of her clothes brushed over the Drow’s nipples, standing them tall and shivering in pleasure. Kenzia reveled in her new body, every contour of it seemingly designed to give and receive pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Are you ready for eternity?” Kenzia whispered into her partner’s ear, panting on her neck.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Kenzia, please!” Mary pleaded.<br />
<br />
With the invitation, Kenzia drew them both to her bed, pushing Mary down onto the sheets as she leapt on top of her. Mary stared up in awe as the Drow held her in place by the wrists. <br />
<br />
“Just sit back, enjoy my love. You’ll only ever get to enjoy the change once.”<br />
<br />
Slowly, she teased down Mary’s shorts, delighting at the panties below, already sodden. Kenzia purred as ripped the garment away. She then drew out the ritual as she tasted up one of Mary pale thighs, and the other, until finally she rewarded both their patience and feasted on her pussy with vigor. Mary’s muscles contracted, her legs clamping around her head and gripping at Kenzia’s braid like a lifeline.<br />
<br />
And with the pleasure came the changes as well. Starting at her groin, Mary’s pale white flesh began to shift, turning a stunning azure the color spread up her midriff and down her legs. Kenzia grinned between tastes of her lover as she felt her legs tighten around her. Sure enough, it was her thighs, her hips and rear filling out as her legs became longer and more shapely until the blue skin tone marched down to the tips of her toes. <br />
<br />
“You weren’t lying. This is incredible!” Mary moaned out in a warm, lilting elvish, her voice carrying itself with a musical quality.<br />
<br />
Kenzia did not halt her work. Her long nails dug deep into Mary’s hips as she upped the pace. Her breasts were next engulfed by the changes working up her body. She mewled in joy as her modest chest burst forth. Mary was only too eager to be rid of her dour human garb, throwing her shirt up over her head and unhooking her bras, just in time as the fabric began straining against her back. She massaged her newly growing breasts, welcoming them to the world as bit her lip, discovering just how sensitive they were. I’m fact, her lower parts also seemed to shiver and tingle with greater pleasure than she’d ever experienced before as well. <br />
<br />
Mary could take no more, the transformation had arced from the tips of  fingers to toes as her skin had fully adopted its new coloration. Her climax was the catalyst for the final stage of her change. Her ears tapered into points, more akin to fins than the traditional points on either side of Kenzia’s face. Her hair tumbled down her shoulders and over the small of her back, it’s  natural auburn turning a vibrant crimson.<br />
<br />
Maraya opened her aquamarine eyes as she rode out the end of her orgasm, Kenzia peeking up from between her legs as she lapped up the last rush of her lover’s juices. The new elf brushed her ears, cooing in joy as she was rewarded with one last brush of pleasure from their erogenous points. <br />
<br />
“Maraya…” the Drow instinctually uttered her new name, crawling up to spoon her exhausted partner.</p>
