<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Moe and Nichole slept in their bed, still naked from their activities yesterday.  They had both decided to join were society, but as which, they haven&#39;t decided yet.<br />
<br />
In Moe&#39;s dream, he was in a bedroom somewhere in Moon Lake.  He noticed that Nichole was on a nearby bed separate from him.  Also in the bedroom was a woman sitting in a chair across from him and a man was also sitting in a chair across from Nichole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want this?  Once we get started, there&#39;s no turning back,&quot; the woman said to him.  She was wearing a white bathrobe, and despite the robe, Moe could tell that the woman had an incredibly sexy figure.  <br />
<br />
Dream Moe took a breath and said, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sure.  We&#39;re sure we want this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Nichole,&quot; the man who was sitting across from Nichole addressed.  He too was wearing a white bathrobe that did little to hide his frame and muscles.  &quot;Did you remember to take your birth control pills?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nichole responded.  &quot;I took them before we came here.&quot;  Both the man and woman smiled each other before they stood up.  <br />
<br />
Moe watched as the woman in his dream took off her bathrobe, revealing her body to him.  She walked up to Moe and straddled him, giving him a deep and passionate kiss, which Moe returned.  She quickly worked on pulling on Moe&#39;s shirt, pulling it off of his body.  The two broke as she lifted his shirt off of his body, and then they resumed kissing.  Moe lifted his hand to feel the woman&#39;s breasts, feeling the fullness of her breasts and tweaking her nipples a little, causing her to moan a bit.  Her hands reached down to Moe&#39;s pants, unfastening them and pulling them down along with his underwear.  Moe kicked his legs to help his pants off of his body, and soon, he was as naked as the woman sitting on him was.  He glanced over to Nichole and the man, and saw that those two were as naked as he was.  He watched as the man took his cock and put inside of Nichole.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Moe felt a warmth and wetness envelop his own cock.  He looked over and saw that the woman put his cock into herself and was now riding on it.  Moe watched as the woman&#39;s breasts bounced with every thrust, and his cock pistoned in and out of her.  He put his hands on her hips, and thrust in time with her.  This caused her to moan, and her moans were in time with their thrusts.  It wasn&#39;t long before the two of them started to speed up, and Moe could feel the pleasure growing in his crotch.  Moe felt himself approaching the point of no return, and the pleasure he was feeling peaked.  He gave out a groan as he felt his cock twitch, sending the last of his human sperm into her.  At the same time, she gave one last moan as he could feel her fluids anointing his cock.  <br />
<br />
Moe glanced over at Nichole and watched as the man piston his hips into her.  The two of them were moving at a fast pace when the man stopped moving all of a sudden as he orgasmed, sending his seed into Nichole.  All four of them were breathing hard, coming down from their respective sex rush.  Moe started to feel warmth throughout his entire body as he looked down at his own chest and arms.  He started to notice fur was growing all over his body.  He looked over at Nichole, and watched as fur started to grow on her body as well.<br />
<br />
It was at this point that Moe woke up from his dream, his own penis erect from the rather erotic dream.  Was it a dream from the future?  Or just his mind imagining what it would be like?  Moe glanced over at Nichole who was still dreaming peacefully.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Nichole was in that white room again.  She met with the various fursona versions of herself, from werebear to weretiger to werefox.  They were all gathered around Nichole congratulating her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re making a good choice,&quot; the werebear version said.  &quot;I think I can speak for all of us when I say that Moe and I never regretted our decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said to her fursona versions of herself.  &quot;I think it was just about being honest with myself.  I&#39;ll admit being put off by the mandatory were law, and even the existence of weres.  But the more I learned, the more I wanted something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have an idea of which were society to join?&quot; the weretiger asked.<br />
<br />
Nichole shook her head and said, &quot;We&#39;ve barely just decided to join were society.  We&#39;re not sure which were to join yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; a werewolf version of herself replied.  &quot;I mean, there aren&#39;t really bad choices.  It&#39;s all about what you want and where you want to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t wait too long,&quot; an older version of her human self said, &quot;If you wait too long, your body won&#39;t be able to handle the stresses of your first change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Nichole said to the older woman.  &quot;It&#39;s something that Moe and I need to discuss.  There are so many choices.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a bit of a struggle, but it&#39;ll work out in the end.  The most important thing is what you want.&quot;  The werevixen put a paw on Nichole&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Just don&#39;t let the many choices paralyze you and be happy with what you choose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole thought for a moment and asked, &quot;What about Karen?  Is she happy?  Did she become furry too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Karen...&quot; the werecougar version said.  &quot;Yeah, she joined were society too.  It&#39;s something she really wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact,&quot; the weretiger version added, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she&#39;s already joined right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Nichole asked as the dream ended.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Nichole woke up with a start.  She looked over at Moe and found him snoring away.  She slipped from her bed and put on a robe to cover her body.  She opened the bedroom door and made her way quietly to Karen&#39;s room.  She opened the door quietly and looked over at Karen&#39;s bed.  She looked over at Karen and saw that, at least as far as she could tell, Karen was still normal.  Nichole decided that it was just a dream and quietly walked back out to her bedroom and joined Moe in bed.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Karen woke up feeling hot all over her body.  The room felt a bit stuffy to her even with the open window.  She idly scratched her chest only for her to feel fur beneath her fingers.  She turned on the lights and discovered white fur growing on her upper chest.  She removed her nightgown and discovered that more of her chest and neck was covered in white fur.  Further, the fur was spreading all over her body.  As the fur reached her arms, it went from white to orange and black.  As the fur approached her hands, she watched as he her fingers extended a bit and her fingernails became more like claws.  Pads formed on the palms of her hand and along the bottom of her fingers.  The fur reached down to her stomach and then her legs, becoming the familiar black and orange stripes that matched her arms.  When the fur reached her feet, her ankles grew away from the balls of her feet.  As this happened, she fell to the ground and her feet continued the change.  Her toenails grew into claws and pads also formed in the balls of her feet and toes.  She looked behind her and found that the fur was also growing on her back in a black and orange stripe pattern.  She pulled her panties down as a tail started to grow near her butt.  <br />
<br />
She reached up to her face and felt the fur growing there as well.  He nose and lips jutted out forward to form a feline muzzle.  Karen used her tongue to feel that her teeth were now very sharp, with her canines extended.  She blinked and the world suddenly looked different to her.  She could feel her ears becoming more rounded and then they migrated to the top of her head.  She felt the top of her head to confirm that her ears did end up moving.  <br />
<br />
Just when she thought the changes were done, pain wracked through her entire body.  She crumpled down into a ball as she heard her bones start to crack as they grew.  Every muscle in her body started to ache as they started to grow to match the new weretigress.  Her bra started to feel uncomfortable to her, and she used her new claws to rip the garment off her body.  She watched as her fur covered breasts grew from what was a B-cup into a C-cup followed by a D-cup all the way to an E-cup.  It wasn&#39;t long before the pain in her body went away, and she was able to stand again.<br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed that she was much taller now by at least two or three feet.  She had new muscle everywhere in her body, and she felt much stronger now that the transformation was finished.  She had a wrestler&#39;s body, and she felt that she could take on anyone, even Marcus Gamboni.  She gave a toothy grin and then she roared to announce her presence as a new weretigress.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
It was at this point that Karen woke up.  She was breathing hard, and it took a moment to realize that she was back in her bedroom.  A quick glance at her hands and chest found no fur.  She climbed out of bed and turned on the light.  She then removed her nightgown and did a careful check of her body.  Looking closely at her arms, and chest, she didn&#39;t see any fur or hair.  She took a quick feel of her neck, and no fur was growing there.  In fact, the only hair on her body was the triangle of hair between her legs which was supposed to be there.  Karen breathed a sigh of relief as she turned off the lights and went back to bed.  She drifted back to sleep to the sound of the crickets in the woods behind the cabin and the falling rain.</p>
