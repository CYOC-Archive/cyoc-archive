<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He sat at his computer looking for some option that would be able to help change himself in a way so Amy wasn&#39;t on the backend of this deal. Jeff looked over at Amy who&#39;s rectangular jaw was comfortably resting on the new stool that only came with this reality. She did seem happy and content with his admittingly stupid choice for her place as his ass, making him not want to undo any of her changes unless she said otherwise. Reaching out with his right hand he petted his butt friend who would also be technically his sister, which he didn&#39;t want to see as her as that just yet. Her cold and rough, scaly head was like rubbing against a rock. He learned from being with her just that day that her head was very durable. From this day alone he accidentally knocked her into various walls, doors, and appliances when he would turned around quickly or hit into a corner. He would ask her if she was alright to which she replied that she couldn&#39;t feel a thing, saying it was like a small pat. Sometimes she didn&#39;t even know she hit into something until he told her about it. The only one worried for them was his mom and even family who seemed to be used to them not bumping into things. Awkwardly since he didn&#39;t quite have the memories of this reality, Amy helped him guide through the house better from her memories alone.<br />
<br />
She seemed to look up at him as he rubbed her scalp. &quot;Do you know what you want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled. &quot;Yes actually,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s see it then, I&#39;m getting pretty tired.&quot; She let out a yawn where he was able to get a glimpse of her open maw, which got you feeling good how nice and clean it was, despite her being your butt. That was about to change soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you like it.&quot; He expressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, I&#39;ll support whatever my host wants to do with themselves.&quot; She then effortlessly lifted her head up and pulled out her head from the hole in the chair like a thread going through a needle. She was ready and so was he, though a bit nervous since he know knew the capabilities this thing could do. He stood up and pressed enter and quickly exited the program hoping to not spoil Amy of his new change.<br />
<br />
Amy wasn&#39;t sure about where and what changes he wanted to try, but since she could feel what he felt, they seemed to start with his face. Bending her neck so that she was facing her host she saw his head shape into something new, this was exciting! His head began stretching with the top coming to a point and his chin as well as his neck seemed to be expanding looking more triangular in shape. She could feel all this and it felt kind of... good. It felt pleasurable even, she could also make out that their male cock seemed to be springing into action. Moaning came out of his mouth while his face and head began to stretch more and more still keeping the triangle shape. While the stretching was happening his face seemed to actually disappear! His nose and ears had sunk into his now more textured flesh, while his eyes remained albeit closed, and his mouth kept on moaning. Amy of course was very confused as to what Jeff was trying to do here, though things started to look familiar. His now bumpy skin started to turn a shade of blue the exact shade Amy was. She even checked the back of his new head, and sure enough the same dark blue and even the spine looked like hers. At first she thought he was growing his head like hers, but his neck was to bulky to even be like her neck. His face was even at the base of the pseudo neck. And the tip looked like her old tail, which got her to finally realize what was going on. Turning her head back facing him it had seemed that the transformation was coming to an end and now it seems like he had turned himself into her old rear end, something she knew all too well. His eyes opened back up and his mouth stopped making noise.<br />
<br />
With him being the exact copy of her tail now his head was now stubbier and almost as long as her neck. Though it seemed he knew that her tail would take up space, her tail was more prehensile and he coiled it a bit around itself looking like a fat pig tail. His eyes located a little lower than his old head with her literally looking down at him. While his mouth still had the same form with soft loose lips, except it was located right were her butthole used to be. This wasn&#39;t at all what she had expected for him to do, but it was a rather unusually interesting change and she got to be reunited to her beautiful tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; She said to Jeff who looked back confused with her comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what do you think?&quot; He hoped for a better response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot; She began creating a dramatic pause for him. &quot;I love it!&quot; This made Jeff sigh relieved that this wasn&#39;t too weird for her. &quot;My beautiful tail is back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted do something that wasn&#39;t bad for both of us and make each other even. Now we&#39;re both each other&#39;s butts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I thought you were more my tail than my butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am, though tails are usually is part of the rear, right?&quot; She nodded though she seemed more skeptical about that thought. &quot;I bet you have a few questions so I thought I&#39;d help you out.&quot; He proceeded to walk over to his nightstand where he had a bag of gummy worms. He then pulled one out and held it over Amy&#39;s snout. Still not sure what he was showing her she ate it, swallowing it down to whatever food goes when she eats. &quot;When we were eating dinner together, it seemed to me that you must digest food to later throw it back up. So I thought why not for us to have both the jobs of eating and disposing one another&#39;s food. So now we have to digestive systems. One where I eat from, and another where you eat from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were able to find out how to do that by yourself. That&#39;s pretty impressive. Though I have one question, don&#39;t we have only one esophagus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so that&#39;s not true anymore. We have both a rectum and esophagus. When your senses picks up food like smell, your esophagus will open up. When your rectum builds up pressure from my poop, then that will open up. Your taste buds will also change to accommodate what&#39;s going in and coming out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about if both are happening at the same time? Will my taste buds mixed up for whatever I decide to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm that is a question I&#39;m not sure if I can answer. Thinking about it, I wonder if eating food would make it taste like poop, that would be really funny if that&#39;s the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this actually. I can&#39;t wait to try eating tomorrow after we get some sleep.&quot; She said giving another yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I have one more surprise for you. It won&#39;t be long to show you.&quot; Jeff said. Amy was tired but was interested where this was going.</p>
