<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Timmy escorted Jamie to the nurse&#39;s office, they underwent a thorough examination. Fortunately, the nurse determined that Jamie&#39;s injuries were minor, and after a few reassuring words, she released him back into the hallway. As the two brothers stepped out of the office, they unexpectedly bumped into Charlie.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Jamie! I’ve been looking for you,” Charlie called out, striding toward them with an eager expression. “We need to talk about your brother.”<br />
<br />
“Sure! Let me introduce you,” Jamie replied, a hint of excitement in his voice. He turned to Timmy, gesturing between them. “Timmy, this is Charlie. And Charlie, this is my brother, Timmy.”<br />
<br />
“Yo!” Timmy exclaimed, his deep voice booming as he playfully waved a massive hand. The eighteen-year-old was built like a tank, his muscular frame evident even beneath his casual t-shirt. He flashed a friendly grin, clearly ready to engage.<br />
<br />
Charlie stood there, utterly baffled, as if he had just been smacked in the face with an unexpected revelation. He had to tilt his head back slightly to take in the impressive, muscular form of Jamie&#39;s little brother, who towered over him at an astonishing seven feet tall. Timmy&#39;s muscles bulged against his fitted shirt, straining the fabric in a way that made Charlie feel almost skinny by comparison. The sheer size of Timmy was both intimidating and awe-inspiring.<br />
<br />
“THAT’S YOUR BROTHER?!” Charlie exclaimed, his voice a mix of disbelief and admiration. “He’s absolutely massive!”<br />
<br />
Jamie crossed his arms, a hint of annoyance creeping into his tone. “I told you he was around seven feet tall,” he rebuked, clearly frustrated that Charlie seemed to have brushed off his earlier warning.<br />
<br />
“I thought you were exaggerating!” Charlie shot back, still trying to process the sight before him. “I didn’t think you were serious! I mean, look at him! He’s like a human mountain!”<br />
<br />
Timmy, standing tall and proud, couldn’t help but chuckle at the reaction. “I guess I just grew a lot recently,” he said, a playful grin spreading across his face.<br />
<br />
Charlie shook his head in disbelief, his eyes darting between Jamie and Timmy. “Dude, you could probably block a shot from the free-throw line without even trying!” he marveled, still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that Jamie’s little brother had grown so much.<br />
<br />
Jamie laughed, enjoying the moment. “Yeah, and he can probably reach the top shelf without a ladder. Now what did you want to talk about?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right. I got in contact with the person who gave me the pill to try and get another one, and they wanted a blood sample from your brother to make sure nothing is wrong and to see what could be done to help your brother. And, by looking at how fast your brother is growing they’re really going to want that sample.”<br />
<br />
“Why are you so surprised that Timmy grew so much? You said he was going to be massive because of the pill,” Jamie asked, raising an eyebrow at Charlie.<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah, but I thought that growth would happen over the course of DAYS,” Charlie replied, shaking his head in disbelief. “I didn’t think anyone could grow that much in a single day! Even when I took the pill, my growth was gradual, taking days to reach my current height.”<br />
<br />
Timmy, who had been listening intently, looked a bit worried. “Am I going to be okay?” he asked, his deep voice tinged with concern.<br />
<br />
“That’s what we’re going to find out,” Charlie said, trying to sound reassuring. “But first, we need to get somewhere out of sight. I have a petri dish to collect a sample of your blood.”<br />
<br />
The three of them quickly made their way to a secluded corner of the school, away from prying eyes. Charlie pulled out a small kit. He carefully prepared to prick Timmy’s skin to draw blood, but as he did, he quickly realized that it wasn’t going to be as easy as he had anticipated.<br />
<br />
“Hold still, Timmy,” Charlie instructed, trying to steady his hand. He pressed the needle against Timmy’s skin, but it was surprisingly tough. After several attempts, he finally managed to break through the surface, but the blood that flowed was minimal and seemed to stop almost immediately. It was as if Timmy’s body was rapidly healing itself, closing the wound before Charlie could collect a proper sample.<br />
<br />
“Wow, this is tougher than I thought,” Charlie muttered, a frown creasing his brow. “It’s like your skin is made of armor or something.”<br />
<br />
Timmy chuckled nervously, trying to lighten the mood. “Guess I’m just built different now, huh?”<br />
<br />
After a few more tries, Charlie finally managed to collect a small amount of blood in the petri dish. He looked at it with a mix of curiosity and concern. “Alright, that should do it. I’ll let Jamie know if they find anything interesting.”<br />
<br />
Afterward, both boys continued with their day, navigating the bustling corridors of school as they attended their classes. Timmy stayed close to Jamie, almost like a shadow, his protective instincts kicking in. He couldn’t shake the worry that the bullies who had once tormented Jamie might return, emboldened by the fact that his brother now appeared smaller in comparison to his towering new stature.<br />
<br />
As they moved from class to class, Timmy’s gaze darted around the hall, ever watchful. Meanwhile, Jamie began to notice the way people were staring at Timmy. It was hard to miss—the glances were frequent and lingering, especially from some of the girls, who looked at him with a mix of admiration and something more flirtatious. Jamie felt a mix of pride and protectiveness as he observed the attention his brother was receiving.<br />
<br />
For Timmy’s part, he seemed blissfully unaware of the effect he was having on those around him. He was too focused on sticking close to Jamie, ensuring that no one would dare to bother him. Whether he didn’t notice the stares or simply didn’t care was unclear, but Jamie could sense the shift in dynamics. Ever since Timmy’s transformation, he had become strikingly attractive, his increased muscle mass and height making him stand out in a way that was hard to ignore. In fact, Jamie couldn’t help but think that Timmy was now even more conventionally attractive than Charlie, who had transformed into the quintessential high school heartthrob.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you good?” Jamie asked, glancing sideways at Timmy, who seemed lost in thought.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, just keeping an eye out for any trouble,” Timmy replied, his brow slightly furrowed. He was still processing the whirlwind of changes in his life and the attention that came with them.<br />
<br />
“Don’t sweat it,” Jamie said with a reassuring smile. “I can handle myself. Besides, I’ve got you watching my back, right?”<br />
<br />
Timmy nodded, though his protective instincts were still on high alert. As they walked through the crowded hallways, Jamie felt a swell of pride for his brother. Timmy’s transformation had not only changed his physical appearance but had also instilled a newfound confidence that was beginning to shine through.<br />
<br />
As the final bell rang, signaling the end of the school day, the brothers stepped outside into the crisp afternoon air. The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, casting a warm golden hue over the school grounds.<br />
<br />
On their way home, the brothers decided to make a quick stop at a clothing store. With the possibility of more sudden growth spurts looming, it was clear that they needed to find some extra-large clothing to accommodate his new size.<br />
<br />
As they entered the store, the bright lights and colorful displays greeted them. Jamie led Timmy through the aisles, scanning the racks for anything that might fit his brother’s impressive frame. “Let’s find you some shirts and pants that won’t feel like they’re about to burst at the seams,” Jamie joked, nudging Timmy playfully.<br />
<br />
Timmy chuckled, his eyes wide with excitement as he browsed through the selections. “I can’t believe I’m actually shopping for clothes in the ‘big and tall’ section,” he said, a mix of disbelief and pride in his voice. “This is so weird!”<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled, enjoying the moment. “Weird, but awesome! You’re growing into your own, and it’s pretty cool to see.” He picked out a few shirts that looked like they would fit Timmy comfortably, holding them up for inspection. “What do you think of this one?”<br />
<br />
Timmy nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah, that looks great! I like the color.” They continued to sift through the racks, picking out a few more items—a couple of loose-fitting t-shirts, some athletic shorts, and even a stylish hoodie that Timmy couldn’t resist.<br />
<br />
After gathering a small pile of clothes, they made their way to the checkout counter. The cashier smiled at them, clearly amused by the sight of the towering Timmy standing next to his brother. “Looks like someone’s been hitting the gym!” she remarked, scanning the items.<br />
<br />
“Something like that,” Jamie replied with a grin, while Timmy just shrugged, a bashful smile creeping onto his face.<br />
<br />
Once they had paid for the clothes, the brothers stepped back outside, the late afternoon sun casting a warm glow over the street. With their shopping bags in hand, they resumed their journey home, the weight of the day’s events slowly lifting as they chatted and laughed together.<br />
<br />
As they walked, Jamie couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride for Timmy. Not only was he adjusting to his new size, but he was also embracing it with confidence. “You know,” Jamie said, glancing sideways at his brother, “I think you’re going to rock those new clothes. You’re going to turn heads everywhere you go.”<br />
<br />
Timmy laughed, a hint of embarrassment coloring his cheeks. “I don’t know about that, but I guess it’ll be nice to have clothes that actually fit well!”<br />
<br />
With that, the brothers continued their walk home, the bond between them growing stronger with each step.</p>
