<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upon hearing his cousin’s name; Sheriff Douglas Cooper turns around to face the young were-otter Brian Walker.<br />
“What about Alyssa,” looking serious as he stares down Brian.<br />
<br />
Before Brian could answer; John Shafer walks into the office. Unsure of what this is about; it was only ten minutes ago he dropped off Julie’s homework after Martin Stovall was kind enough to give him a lift to school. John still sees Julie’s school work where he left it; John also then notices Sheriff Cooper and a state trooper also in the office. Principal Andrews beckoning the werewolf to join him and the two law enforcement officers in his office; leaving Brian to wait for his chance to talk to the sheriff.<br />
<br />
John sitting down in one of the chairs; sheriff cooper in the other and the state trooper standing by the desk, John Shafer is wondering if he was in trouble for something.<br />
“John,” Sheriff Cooper sighing; “we have some unfortunate news to give to you. It concerns your mother.”<br />
“What did she do this time,” John looking disgusted; “did she attack anyone while in jail?”<br />
“No,” the state trooper speaking up; “your mother died last night while in custody.”<br />
<br />
John felt a cold pall envelop him. The last time he talked to her was last Tuesday as she was in the town’s jail awaiting transfer; their conversation was not pleasant.<br />
“How,” was all John said.<br />
“We don’t know son,” Sheriff Cooper answers; “with her alcoholism, it’s not a far stretch to guess liver failure.”<br />
“But she was sober when I last talked to her,” John trying to hold back his tears; “how could her liver just give out?” He was about to say his mother was a were, but caught himself in time; the state trooper was clearly a normal.<br />
“She may have been suffering from liver failure for some time,” the state trooper answers; “but we won’t know for certain until the medical examiner performs an autopsy.”<br />
“NO,” John shouts; “you’re not cutting my mother up. I won’t allow it!”<br />
“Son,” Sheriff Cooper states; “it’s necessary, when a person in custody dies; its state law.”<br />
“But,” John wanting to shout out more but the sheriff embraces him and whisper in his ear so only he could hear. “It’s alright Brian; the medical examiner is like us. He is a were as well.”<br />
“Are you certain,” Brain asks.<br />
“Yes,” the sheriff answers cupping his finger to display \/\/ the sign that weres do when identifying themselves to each other.<br />
Principal Andrews who did not hear what the sheriff whispered in John’s ear knew what the hand signal meant. Choosing this moment to speak up; “perhaps its best that John and the state trooper head over to where Beth McDougal works. Its best she also is given the news of her sister’s passing.”<br />
“Yes,” the trooper answers; “but I rode here in the sheriff’s car. He is my ride as it were.”   <br />
“That’s right,” Sheriff Cooper responds; “perhaps the two can wait outside while I find out what Brian walker has to say to me.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Brain Walker was sitting in the Principal’s office with both the Principal and Sheriff looking at him. Seeing John Shafer walk out of the office with the state trooper consoling him; he knew the news for him wasn’t good. Hearing rumors regarding his mother; Brian assumed that it had something to do with her. But that wasn’t his concern at the moment. Brian was staring in front of two weres that were waiting for him to say what he wanted to say. Brian grabbing his cellphone, he pulls up the last message that Alyssa sent him and shows it the sheriff.<br />
“So my cousin snuck back into town,” reading the message and skimming the previous ones that Brian kept; “mind telling me for what reason?”<br />
“Sex would of be the first guess,” Brian beginning to speak; “but I told her I couldn’t be out for very long because I was grounded and snuck out to meet her.”<br />
<br />
Brian sighs and continues with what he needed to say. He details the previous time the two met; information that Sheriff Cooper already knew of. What surprised him was that Brian told him all about Alyssa’s plans to turn him into a gigolo. And in fact she pimped the kid out to a friend of hers already.<br />
“My cousin has gone too far this time,” Sheriff Cooper seething; “What else have you been holding back.”<br />
“I let slip to Alyssa that I am a self-taught computer hacker and that I did research in how to get someone declared legally dead online.”<br />
“Oh fuck,” was all the sheriff said; “what did you do?”<br />
“Nothing yet,” Brian sighing; “Alyssa wants me to have mayor Stovall declared dead. She expects an answer from me when we meet after school.”<br />
“First off,” Principal Andrews getting involved; “why would you research in having someone declared dead?”<br />
“My father, George Walker,” Brian responds; “he ran out on me and my mom when I was little. Left her with a mountain of debt and no assets as he ran off with some floozy; the elder council knows of the situation, and by know they know that I in a fit of anger, had him legally declared dead.” Looking at the sheriff, “if you don’t believe me; ask my mom, she’ll confirm what I just told you.”<br />
“You bet I will,” the sheriff looking like he is about to shift into his were-bear fursona; “but moving back to my cousin. Where exactly are you two planning to meet?”<br />
“A couple blocks from here after school,” Brian answered; “It was my suggestion, but I swear I never expected her to ask me to do what I just told you.”<br />
“I believe you,” Sheriff Cooper responds; “do you know if she is driving the same car as before?”<br />
“No,” Brian answers; “it’s a blue Ford Taurus with a license plate beginning with the letter ‘R’.”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Douglas Cooper growled as he heard that. He saw the exact same vehicle parked at Café Luna earlier today. If he had of went into the coffee shop he would of spotted his cousin eating a bagel while sipping her latte. Getting up he looks at Brian; “thank you for telling me all this. I know it must have been difficult for you. But that doesn’t mean you are off the hook. I will be informing your mother of what you just said; and I will most likely be forced to arrest my cousin for some charge after I consult with a member of the elder council.”<br />
“What am I to do in the meantime,” Brian asks.<br />
“You still have classes to attend,” Principal Andrews speaks up; “I’ll give you a note to pass to your first period teacher excusing your absence, but you will high tail it to your second period class.”</p>
