<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex decided that the best way to test it was to make himself female. He also decided to be younger. He selected 11 for his age and female for his gender. He wanted reality to be altered so he made sure that yes was highlighted on that. He highlighted yes on both Aware and User Aware. He was using it on himself so either one should be sufficient but he didn't want to risk one canceling the other out. He highlighted new for the memory priority since he wanted to know how to be a girl. Once he was done he pointed the top of the phone at himself and pressed send.<br />
<br />
The sensation that accompanied this was strange. It was like wind going right through you. The first thing that Alex noticed was that his clothes disappeared. He was glad that he was alone in his apartment. As he was staring at his body in disbelief he noticed that the scars he got when he was 32 from a drunk slashing him with a knife. Suddenly the aches and pains that had been plaguing him since he was 29 also disappeared. He noticed that his skin was getting a bit tighter like it had been when he was younger. Suddenly he started to shrink. He went from 5 foot 8 to 4 foot 7, the height he was when he was 11. As he was shrinking his body, facial, and pubic hair started to thin until eventually the only hair he had left was a few pubic hairs.<br />
<br />
Alex shrunk another half inch so he was now 4 foot 6 1/2. He felt his scalp tingling and something tickling the back of his neck and eventually his back. He reached behind him, grabbed a handful of his hair, and brought it around front to look at it. His hair had stopped growing when it had reached just below the level of his armpits. When he had looked at his hair he caught sight of his hand and fingers slimming, becoming more like a girls. His fingernails also grew a little bit beyond the end of his fingers. He looked up his arm in time to see it slimming also. Next he looked at his feet and legs and noticed the same thing happen to them. He noticed that his torso was slimming though his hips didn't slim as much. He watched as his dick shrank and his balls pulled up into his body. Soon there was nothing left of his dick. He bent down to check things out and he saw that his ballsack had formed the lips of a pussy. he looked at his chest just in time to see the aureole enlarge and his nipples push out a bit. All through this he didn't feel anything so he didn't know that his face was now more feminine.<br />
<br />
Clothes appeared on Alex starting with a pair of pink panties and white ankle socks. Next a red tee shirt, denim skirt, and white tennis shoes with pink piping appeared. Suddenly his apartment seemed to dissolve and then reform into a bathroom.<br />
<br />
Alex felt a sense of vertigo come over him as new memories flooded his mind. His name was now Lexi Donaldson and she was in the 5th grade. It was the lunch period and it was about to end. She and her friend Tanya Scott had came in to use the toilet. She was still holding her TransFone and the TransFone Mode was still on. She didn't want anyone to see this so she quickly pressed power/end. She had done it just in time as she heard a toilet flush and saw Tanya come out of one of the stalls in the mirror. This was the first time that she had seen the changes to her face. It was roundish and slim with a cute button nose and normal looking lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lexi!&quot; Tanya said. &quot;You know that they don't allow cell phones to be on in school. If you get caught you'll get suspended.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; Lexi said. &quot;I don't know what I was thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hopefully they didn't see you with it on&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't turn it on&quot; Lexi said. It was the truth, sort of.<br />
<br />
The warning bell sounded then and Tanya said &quot;We better hurry. We don't want to be late for Mrs. Hemlock's class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding&quot; Lexi said. &quot;I heard that she sent Billy Hadden to the principal's office when he had come in just as the tardy bell rang.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Tanya said. &quot;I heard that too. I really don't want to go to the principal's office today. We'll get a detention and miss gymnastics if we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would not be good&quot; Lexi said. &quot;I want to go to the Olympics when I'm older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too&quot; Tanya said as she picked up her purse and books.<br />
<br />
Lexi closed her phone, put it in her purse, and picked her purse and books up saying &quot;We better get going then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I was saying&quot; Tanya said as they left the girl's restroom and headed to their next class.</p>
