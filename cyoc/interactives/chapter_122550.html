<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The evening at the Jenkins home went fairly well. On some level, Huck would have liked to have taken Betty to the dance and declare before many of the teachers that had taught him and were still there that they had truly found each other, but he was still recovering from the gunshot wound to the chest. He was feeling stronger, and that did make him eager to enjoy his engagement in every way, but he didn&#39;t have a follow up appointment with the doctors that treated him until Monday. It would only be then that he would get confirmation that lycanthropic regeneration had fully healed the damage done. <br />
<br />
At the same time, he found himself also receiving the attention of the younger Harpers. John asked a question or two about the things he planned to do to make this apartment for Harry and Jenny, which he was all too willing to share. It let him think over specific ideas on refurbishing the attic above the garage, which Huck knew was largely bare otherwise. There were some things that were stored up there, and Huck did see his father, Henry, and Jenny&#39;s older brother James, collect a couple of old army cots that had been bought years ago for when the family went camping and moving them to a side spot in the living room, but there wasn&#39;t that much up there.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really have a lot of ideas...&quot; John said to him after a moment.<br />
<br />
Huck smiled, &quot;well... it&#39;s something both my dad and I have done to time to time for people... Jenkins Construction does a lot of that sort of thing, and we&#39;re good at it. And once everything is all set up and you and your little sister&#39;s futures are secured... you can help with the paint. But you&#39;ll have to remember that Harry and Jenny are the client, and what they want is always right... The first rule of service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; John said slowly and resumed watching a game show they had on television.<br />
<br />
Huck quietly watched him for a moment before a soft pat on his shoulder and he looked over to see Janice seated on arm of the couch with a rather curious look about her. He&#39;d rapidly found that she was rather interested in things that related to Moon Lake&#39;s secret, which wasn&#39;t really a problem. From somethings he&#39;d heard, those kinds of people usually ended up being the ones who became &quot;the family were.&quot; Though, Janice was the most interest in weremers by some of her questions there were some questions that went with other weres in Moon Lake, and judging by her bright eyes and raised eyebrows... Huck figured that Janice had a new question.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose you want to paint the walls too?&quot; Huck asked to her playfully, giving a small grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can let John paint,&quot; Janice asked, &quot;I have another question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured,&quot; Huck smiled and softly rubbed Janice&#39;s head. He winced a little as he deliberately used the arm that was healing, mostly his own private test to see that the limb was healing. Huck was satisfied that his arm was healing even with the hint of pain at trying to move the limb. &quot;What&#39;s your question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you talk to dogs?&quot; Janice asked, &quot;since you&#39;re a were? You know... know their language... or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
That actually made him blink in surprise. That was something that he&#39;d never thought about or even looked into. After becoming a weredog, the actual idea of having a pet was not something that really was strong. He could become a dog and was part of a pack of weredogs, and a part of him now couldn&#39;t wait for when he and Betty could be together in every way was one of those things that saw no reason to have a dog as a pet. Thus there was no instance in which he&#39;d wanted a pet or saw a need for one, and thus Huck really didn&#39;t know if he could. He&#39;d also heard from some others that weres and mundane animals did not always get along. Pet animals like dogs and cats, as well as livestock like horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and others did well, but from what some had told Huck this had often to do their frequent contact from young ages, but animals that did NOT have frequent contact with humanity or weres tended to be unusually aggressive against weres for reasons that were unknown.<br />
<br />
His silence, though soon served to attract a fair amount of attention. John turned back curiously, and James Jr, who had returned to the living room after finishing the last of the efforts to make sure that all sleeping arrangements were handled, was presently leaning against an open spot on the wall. Both of them looked about as curious as to what Huck would answer and were so focused on Huck that the sound of both the phone ringing and kids beginning to go trick or treating wasn&#39;t noticed. Huck was happy to answer, but it was a first for him in that this was actually the first time he&#39;d been asked this specific question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really know about if I can... I&#39;ve never actually tried,&quot; Huck admitted, &quot;though I have heard, though, that for most part weres and mundane animals don&#39;t get along. Some pets and livestock do well... but animals not used to weres have been told to be more aggressive with weres than they would be otherwise... Maybe because predatory weres often do hunt and it&#39;s a fearful response over competition... or maybe it&#39;s one of the things where people talk about things like magic and that weres are not &quot;natural&quot; and thus the unnaturally aggressive response.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you and Jenny look nice,&quot; Janice stated.<br />
<br />
Huck managed to reach over and pat Janice&#39;s shoulder, &quot;And I am nice, and I&#39;m sure Jenny is nice as a Fennec Fox based werefox... but that doesn&#39;t mean that the way the world works reflects that... Though... I&#39;ll also say that what I&#39;ve told you reflects how weres and animals on land interact. I can&#39;t say about sea creatures. Maybe they get along better... maybe not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know any weremermaids?&quot; Janice then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not personally,&quot; Huck admitted, &quot;though I think the mayor and his wife are weremers...&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice gave something of an &quot;oh&quot; in response when Henry Jenkins came into the living room from the kitchen area. They all looked up to him and soon noticed rather concerned look on his face. Huck was also quick to notice that his father&#39;s focus went across the room to James Harper Jr. After a few moments, James Jr. noticed and straightened up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, sir?&quot; James Jr. asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Tachibana just called from the hospital,&quot; Henry spoke, getting everyone&#39;s full attention with that line, &quot;Your father&#39;s apparently had some complications... either that there was more blockage that they didn&#39;t see initially... or was stressed by something that in its weakened state it couldn&#39;t sustain...&quot;<br />
<br />
James Jr. looked down for a moment with a rather heavy sigh. His father was a real &quot;piece of work&quot; when it came to many things, but that didn&#39;t necessarily meant that he wanted his father to die. In reality, he really hoped to get his father to reform himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to hospital security, your mother was seated by his side and seemed to be saying something,&quot; Henry continued, &quot;and after she finished something... your father seemed to have whatever response that amounted to this additional heart attack... or stress induced problem. It has panicked your mother and the staff has moved her to a waiting room and are trying to keep her calm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not doing well,&quot; James Jr. finished as he looked between John and Janice and then to Henry Jenkins.<br />
<br />
&quot;They say she was under a lot of stress, herself,&quot; Henry spoke, &quot;which I&#39;m sure much of today was. They&#39;re actually asking for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; James Jr. wondered.<br />
<br />
Henry nodded, &quot;Either to calm her down or get her to this hotel...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And my father?&quot; James Jr. asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Tachibana said that was best said in person... likely that there are some certain things they need for consent to move forward, and your mother has seemed too... out of it to be clear,&quot; Henry spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; James Jr. sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty and I can keep an eye on things,&quot; Huck assured him, &quot;don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p>
