<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well Ann to be honest your mother is still your mother,” Merlin said. “But since your now my daughter it doesn’t truely matter. Your magical in nature now.”<br />
<br />
Ann nodded as she turned to gaze at her appearance. It was her at 14 the only difference being her accent and red hair. Touching her shoulder length hair she frowned. “You know I can live with the accent,” she said. “But I’m not a big fan of the hair.” Merlin smiled, waving his hand. Ann watched as her auburn locks transformed once more to blond. Smiling she turned to the elderly wizard. “Thanks dad.”<br />
ERwaqwl<br />
Merlin smirked impishly before pausing, the sound of footsteps thundering up the stairs made him nervous. “I’ll be back soon,” he said quickly before vanishing. As he vanished Ann and Jackie saw the door fly open. <br />
<br />
“Ann stop!”<br />
<br />
Katie quickly scanned the room searching for someone as her eyes fell on Ann and Jackie a look of despair crossed her face. “We’re too late,” she sighed sadly. Ann and Jackie gave each other a confused look as they looked at Katie and Gloria. Before anyone could say anything Gloria stormed over to where they were standing, slapping Ann and Jackie across the face. “How could you,” she growled.<br />
<br />
“Gloria what is it,” Jackie stammered, her cheek burning from where Gloria had hit her. Gloria sighed angrily as she glared at her friend. “Do you have any idea what you two have done,” she moaned, her eyes beginning to dampen with tears. “You...you messed everything up.”<br />
<br />
“Katie I don’t know what’s going on tell us,” Ann pleaded as she looked at her niece. Katie sighed sadly, looking at the two 14 year old girls with a mixture of sadness and disdain. “Both of you need to follow me NOW!” Jackie and Ann looked at each other with concern as they followed the sisters out of the room. Slowly the girls made their way downstairs, as Ann now looked at the living room she gasped in shock.<br />
<br />
The room was now filled with several people. Aside from her family, Tricia and Tommy Ann noticed another set of people standing solemnly. As she looked closely she could see they were older versions of Lisa, Jason, Katie, Gloria and Samantha. “Wh..what’s going on here,” she asked.<br />
<br />
The younger Lisa turned towards Ann and Jackie, a look of pain crossing her face. “You were right,” she whispered. “I...I didn’t want to believe it but your right.”<br />
<br />
“Can someone please tell us what’s going on,” Jackie exclaimed, tightly grasping Ann’s hand. Lisa sighed as she motioned for the older Katie and Gloria to step forward as they did they looked the teens over hesitantly. “While yountwo were upstairs we arrived,” Katie said. “You see, we’re from Lynne’s time. We journeyed back here because the timeline has been changed.”<br />
<br />
“How,” Ann asked.<br />
<br />
The older Katie and Gloria now motioned for the older Lisa to step forward. “Ann,” she said sadly. “The man you and Lynne talked to wasn’t Merlin. He was something else. He tricked all of you, he made people believe Lisa’s preganancy was destroyed and convinced you to do...this.”<br />
<br />
“Wait Lisa’s Okay,” Ann exclaimed. “That’s great! Right?”<br />
<br />
The older Lisa shook her head sadly as she now motioned behind her. Ann watched as a shy red haired teen appraoched. “No,” she said. “The girl in front of you is Emily. She Lynne’s twin sister and the person who was originally my mother. The Merlin you saw lied in order to gain access to this timeline and also to capture Lynne. When Lynne passed out they moved on to a different target...namely you.”<br />
<br />
Ann stood stunned as she took this information in. What were these people talking about? Who was after her? She needed to know. <br />
<br />
“Perhaps I can answer that question.” Ann turned to see Merlin standing by the front door, a devilish smile fixed to his face. “Dad What are they talking about?”<br />
<br />
“Silly girl,” Merlin smirked. “I’m not your father, but Ihave laid claim to you.” The older Katie and Gloria now assumed a defensive stance as they gazed at the well dressed wizard. “Show yourself Morgan,” they growled. Merlin began to chuckle softly. As he did Ann watched as he began to change. Slowly the wizards face grew softer as his grey hair began to lighten to a golden blond. The suit he wore transformed into flowing robes, while his beard fell away replaced by a large set of breasts. As the transformation completed Morgan LeFay smiled. <br />
<br />
“Ah much better,” she sighed. Turning towards the older Katie and Gloria she tilted her head slightly. “Well now this is interesting,” she smirked. “It appears I’ve given Lisa twins. How marvelous, especially since Lynne didn’t wish to give herself over after thinking she had destroyed herself. Now, not only do I have two magical twins to go after, I have a girl connected to her as well.”<br />
<br />
Morgan turned towards Ann as she grinned devilishly. “Oh Ann by you willing becoming this you have given me what I desire most...access. We are connected now Ann meaning I can enter this home anytime I wish. Soon not only will I have you under my control but Lynne as well. Heh perhaps even her sister.”<br />
<br />
“Lynne get behind,” the older Lisa commanded her daughter. Lynne obliged without comment as Lisa stared her down. “Please Lisa,” Morgan laughed. “You know you can not possibly stand before my magic.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe not,” the older Katie and Gloria stated. “But we can.”<br />
<br />
Morgan narrowed her eyes as Katie and Gloria now stood before Morgan, their hands pointed at Morgan ready to attack. Before Morgan could say anything else the older Samantha and Katie and Gloria joined them. A crooked smile fixed itself upon Morgan’s face as she glared at them. “Interesting,” she replied Coyly. “This could prove a challenge.”<br />
<br />
“Then perhaps I should tip the scales.”<br />
<br />
Morgan now saw the elderly Merlin step forward. Angrily he gazed at the sorceress his arms at the ready. Before Morgan to react six wizards shouted a spell. The force of the blast knocking Morgan backwards causing her to crash into the wall. <br />
<br />
“Damn you,” she spat, as she tried to stand. “Don’t think you’ve won, I will return, Lynne and her sister will be MINE!” As quickly as she arrived Morgan vanished, leaving behind nothing but a hole from the impact. Merlin sighed as he now gazed at a stunned Ann and Jackie. “Girls,” she said sadly. “Your actions today were motivated by selfishness. By Ann becoming a teen once more she has put her family at risk. Morgan La Fay can now attack at anytime because you have opened the door to her. Jackie, Ann...you have betrayed us and as a result.....you can’t stay here.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie gaped at the elderly wizard as he stared sadly at them. Looking at the others they could see looks of anger, sadness and disappointment etched on everyone’s faces. Ann looked desperately at the others, still shocked at what she had been tOld. Slowly she could see her former little sister approach a look of anguish on her tired face. “L..Lisa,” She stammered. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know.”<br />
<br />
Lisa could only sigh as she slowly opened the front door. “Ann,” she whispered, a single tear running down her cheek. “You betrayed me. You knew I didn’t want you to do this. You did it anyway and put my family at risk. I don’t have magic but I have to say this to protect the people left in my life. You need to leave....and never return.”<br />
<br />
Lisa now slowly pushed the two teens outside. “Lisa please,” Ann cried, tears beginning to fall from her eyes. “I’m your sister, please don’t make us go.”<br />
<br />
“You were my sister,” Lisa whispered. “But your not anymore. I’m sorry Ann...Jackie...you are no longer welcome in this house,”<br />
<br />
Ann now began to cry as Lisa closed the front door. As she collapsed to her knees all Jackie could do was try to comfort the poor girl as she sobbed uncontrollably. Neither noticed as they faded from this reality.</p>
