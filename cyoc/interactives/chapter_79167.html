<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I Suddenly saw a white linen suit one that resembled the one that my <br />
ol'man used to have. I recalled he liked to use a white linen suit on <br />
Sundays usually for church or a wedding.<br />
As I stepped closer to suit, I began to realize that the suit was <br />
almost identical as my father's. It had the same number of pockets, it <br />
was packed with a purple shirt just like the one pops used and, hell, <br />
it seemed to have the same unmatching button in the middle that I <br />
broke while playing in dad's lap. I was dumbfounded but the it hit me, <br />
After mom's death had donated it to Salvation Army. Probably Mina <br />
bought it back from them. I carefully approached and examined it.<br />
<br />
-&quot;A nice choice, honey&quot; said Mina while crossing her arms and pushing <br />
her breasts almost out of her cleavage.<br />
-&quot;This, This suit, it was mine, I mean I know where it comes from&quot; I <br />
said<br />
-&quot;Oh that might be true&quot; said Mina while smirking &quot;Most of the clothes <br />
I sell are second-handed&quot;<br />
she approached to me uncrossing her arms, leaning to my ear<br />
-&quot;but that's what makes them special&quot; she whispered in my ear<br />
-&quot;How can it make it special? I think is kinda gross&quot; I replied<br />
-&quot;Every suit, shoe and dress of this store has a story&quot; she answered <br />
while she leaned back &quot;Have you heard the expression &lt;&lt;Put yourself in <br />
the other's shoes&gt;&gt;?&quot;<br />
-&quot;Sorta, but what do you mean?&quot;<br />
-&quot;You'll see, when you wear a used garment it changes your appearance <br />
to a similar one that the owner had in his life, you could say second <br />
hand clothes can be thought as costumes, those who use them <br />
impersonate the previous owner&quot; she said it cynically.<br />
-&quot;Uh... you kinda like the philosophical stuff right&quot; i said due to <br />
the awkwardness of her statement.<br />
Mina Laughed in a melodic tune -&quot;I just say that to people who doesn't <br />
really like to buy secondhand clothes, but still it rings a truth&quot; She <br />
said the last part in dark tone.<br />
A chill ran trough my spine, maybe it was the cold or maybe this woman <br />
was up to something, but I felt queasy.<br />
&quot;C'mon, take the suit! I promise I *will* fit you&quot; she said in a sweet <br />
voice.<br />
I looked her suspiciously.<br />
-&quot;I know you might feel upset right now about your daddy, but when I'm <br />
upset I like to shop or put myself in different outfits, it's <br />
distracting. I swear that you'll feel much different if you try that <br />
suit.&quot;<br />
I lowered my guard and began to consider taking the suit.<br />
-&quot;C'mon, Let me do my good deed of the day&quot;<br />
-&quot;Ohhhkay&quot; I said and pressed the suit into my chest.<br />
-&quot;I'm so sorry, but as you can see it's so crammed in here that the <br />
dressing room is filled, you should try it in your home&quot;<br />
-&quot;Yes, I guess so&quot; I said finally accepting the suit<br />
-&quot;You know I'm kinda in a rush now but I'll be close if you ever need <br />
another suit&quot; she said nonchalantly as she dismissed me.<br />
Not a moment to soon I was out of the store -&quot;But I'd like to talk to <br />
yo-&quot; I turned to the store and saw Mina fade into the store, busy <br />
looking.<br />
<br />
I walked home, I knew dad was furious but It was getting dark, I <br />
wished dad understood better and I was hoping he wouldn't accuse me of <br />
stealing a suit. As I came home I found all lights off, I opened the <br />
door silently with my key but it squeaked anyway. I closed my eyes <br />
regretting the sound. I passed through the kitchen and I saw Dad in <br />
the living room with the TV on, he was passed out again, the bourbon <br />
was empty in the coffee table and he was laying in the sofa, shirtless <br />
and snoring. I thought it was amusing, that every time he drank he had <br />
to be shirtless or in underwear supposedly because booze would get him <br />
&quot;hot and sweaty&quot; instead of &quot;cold and piss-y&quot;. I smiled as I thought <br />
of that. But the smile fade quickly as father moved.<br />
 I approached him as stealthy as I could just to check if he was <br />
asleep or not. the TV was loud and I realized he was really passed <br />
out, so I grabbed the remote and muted the TV, then I realized that <br />
his eyes were swollen almost bloated, I realized that he must had been <br />
crying, a picture of me was laying in the sofa, it was me being held <br />
by my mom.<br />
<br />
I quickly went upstairs to my bedroom I had to try the suit and then <br />
hide it before dad woke up. As i unpacked it became certain that this <br />
was my father's linen suit. I spread it over the bed and got <br />
undressed, just my jeans and shirt, because ever since I was sixteen i <br />
stopped using underwear, I liked the freshness.<br />
I began to put the suit, first the shirt and buttoned up, then the <br />
pants and finally the coat, then I saw myself in the mirror.<br />
It was horrible my slender complexion was different from dads muscular <br />
frame and my long arms and legs didn't fit the length of the suit, I <br />
looked ridiculous with short sleeves and loose backsides. I thought if <br />
I ever would look as imposing as dad, he'd been on the construction <br />
works for a lifetime and he's still strong as an ox, sure i'm quick <br />
and agile but I'm not naturally intimidating as dad i just have a bad <br />
attitude but dad had the badass physique.<br />
As I went trough my musings a tingling warm sensation started in my <br />
body, it felt as warm and numbing sensation, oddly it began in my <br />
crotch on the tip of my cock. but it began to spread to my body and it <br />
felt ecstatic. the sensation became stronger, so I laid down in my bed <br />
then the itch began, in the same way from the tip of my cock through <br />
out my body. I had to rub my cock but the sensation of the linen suit <br />
combined with the warmth was so inviting, so pleasurable that I <br />
started to rub the suit into my body.<br />
I stood up again a bit dizzy and realized that I had erection, but my <br />
dick was different, as I undid my zipper my penis popped out and began <br />
to thicken, and darken as it happened I felt as millions of tiny <br />
feathers tingled my penis. My balls began to grow too, and the hair <br />
around them began to darken, the feathery feeling spread through my <br />
thighs as they grew and became more muscular and hairy, the sensation <br />
spread to my butt and it felt as dozens of diminutive kisses were <br />
running through my anus. My buttocks began to grew and to become more <br />
hard. A patch of black hair sprouted from my pubes to my navel and <br />
then toward my chest as I felt each of the hairs growing gently, it <br />
was like tickles but far more pleasant, the hairs grew toward my <br />
nipples then i felt as if some butterfly fluttered over my nipples and <br />
the sensation grew into a indescribable pleasure. As i breathed my <br />
chest expanded and got tighter my pecs became prominent and then I <br />
felt as if my armpits where licked softly. My biceps and arms became <br />
bulked and hairy, my thighs and hamstrings became muscular and manly, <br />
as i looked into the mirror my once auburn hair was changing into a <br />
messy salt and pepper. My jaw became wider and my eyes dark. My feet <br />
felt ticklish and began to expand grow too.<br />
I realized I was transforming into DAD! not only dad but a younger <br />
dad, the same age he had when he stopped using the suit! <br />
As the sensations overwhelmed my body and mind, I felt I was about to <br />
cum... then I heard a noise from downstairs.</p>
