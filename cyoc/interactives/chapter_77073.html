<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Huh, a topless bikini contest. That sounds like it could be interesting. Carl though to himself, and then a <br />
split second later he connected some dots. &quot;Oh no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes!&quot; Wendy said picking up Carl and practically dragging him to the contest manager. &quot;I'm sorry to <br />
interrupt, but we've got two late entries right here.&quot; Wendy said to the announcer. The announcer looked up <br />
from his clipboard and his eyes went wide when he saw the beauties before him. &quot;Sounds good to me, what are <br />
your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Wendy Matson and this is my sister Carly Matson.&quot; Wendy said sounding very enthusiastic. &quot;Wendy, I don't <br />
exactly feel comfortable doing this.&quot; Carl said trying desperately to get out of this. &quot;Well you're the one <br />
who wanted to do something different today, this is certainly different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean...&quot; but before Carl could finish his argument the announcer said &quot;Well ladies, you're in. You <br />
two just have to put your numbers on and get to the end of the stage. Wendy, you're number 12 and Carly is <br />
lucky number 13.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, lucky.&quot; Carl said as Wendy put the number sticker just above Carl's left breast. Wendy dragged Carl up <br />
onto a makeshift stage beside the pool that used the diving board for a runway. As soon as they got their, the <br />
announcer started the festivities. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our weekly topless bikini contest!&quot; There <br />
was a rousing applause, particularly from the gentlemen. &quot;The rules are simple, each lovely lady struts her <br />
stuff down our runway and gets 30 seconds to impress the you the audience, and our judge.&quot; The announcer at <br />
this made reference to a man in too nice a suit to be at such an event. &quot;Then, the contestant will dive into <br />
the pool and swim over to our judge. I don't know if this has any effect on the scoring but I know we enjoy <br />
it, don't we guys!&quot; A bunch of hoots, hollers, and wolf whistles were given in response. &quot;We will now get <br />
started with contestant number 1!&quot;<br />
<br />
One by one each of the contestants made their way down the makeshift runway. It didn't take long for Carl to <br />
notice the reason this was done, each step on the diving board was producing an ample amount of jiggling. Each <br />
contestant was cute and made all sorts of flirty motions towards the judge and the each dove in with some cute <br />
motion and swam for the judge. Carl had seen a few contests like this (not that he'd admit it to Wendy) but he <br />
hadn't seen one quite like this. Finally the announcer called up Wendy. She looked at Carl and said, &quot;Wish me <br />
luck,&quot; to which Carl said, &quot;I thought that was your job.&quot; The two laughed as Wendy walked with confidence down <br />
the runway and did some little erotic dance motions that got the crowd stirred up. Carl knew it was getting <br />
him stirred up too as he actually remember some of the moves she was performing in front of everyone that she <br />
used to do for him. Of course Carl had to remind himself, she hasn't done those moves in years. Finally it <br />
came time for Wendy's dive and instead of doing some cute little thing for the judge, she just turned around <br />
and dove in backwards doing a back stoke to the judge with her breasts on full display much to the delight of <br />
the audience. She got out of the pool and Carl knew he was up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And our last contestant, please give a warm welcome to Carly Matson!&quot; Carl slowly and anxiously walked down <br />
the diving board. This entire time Carl had been doing everything he could with his arms to cover himself up, <br />
although nothing was working as well as he'd liked. He'd only been on the board for a few seconds when he <br />
started hearing some crude remarks from the crowd, most of which said something along the likes of 'Show us <br />
what you've got.' But Carl was determined to get out of this with as much dignity as possible, At least until <br />
he heard a voice above the crowd that sounded like Wendy, &quot;Hey buzz off! She's my sister and she's going to <br />
show you what she's got. She's just shy. I just wish she'd show you guys her stuff.&quot; Carl knew what was coming <br />
even though he tried to stop it. His arms start to move on their own it seemed finally revealing his <br />
significant chest to the world. The more Carl tried to cover himself up, the more he ended up looking like a <br />
tease, hiding but not really hiding anything. This routine was really getting the crowd going, Carl even <br />
noticed the judge drop his pen to gaze at him. Carl was ecstatic when the long 30 seconds were up and he just <br />
dove into the water and swam as quickly as he could to the judge. Although it seemed he had swam too violently <br />
as right after he pulled himself out of the water in front of the judge, he noticed that his bikini bottoms <br />
had become unknotted and were now floating in the water. The crowd went absolutely nuts but Carl tried not to <br />
notice as he dove right back in and put the bottoms on as if hoping nobody would notice.<br />
<br />
He got out of the pool and Wendy gave him a big hug. &quot;Way to go sis! You sure showed them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn't have done it without you.&quot; Carl said dryly.<br />
<br />
As if he couldn't be embarrassed enough, he had to go back on stage so they could declare a winner. Walking <br />
past some of the contestants he could here a few words like 'slut' and 'whore' being thrown around, and Carl <br />
couldn't really blame them at all. Finally the judge had tallied the votes. &quot;Thank you all for your patience. <br />
We certainly hope you all enjoyed the show. But we have a winner to crown. And the winner of the topless <br />
bikini contest is...&quot; he ripped open an envelope to read the results, &quot;Oh my we've never had something like <br />
this happen before! It's a tie! The winners are the sister act of Wendy and Carly Matson!&quot; The crowd loved it <br />
and Wendy pulled you up to the announcer to accept a trophy and a series of gift cards for a bunch of beauty <br />
salons in Vegas. Carl put on a fake smile and waved to the fans. A bunch of people ran up to them for the next <br />
20 minutes or so requesting photos with them and being polite they obliged, at least Wendy did, Carl was just <br />
along for the ride.<br />
<br />
Finally things calmed down and the two finally got a moment of rest. Carl told Wendy, &quot;Was the swimsuit <br />
falling off in the pool really needed?&quot; Wendy laughed, &quot;I swear, I didn't do that. That was all you,&quot; the two <br />
got a good laugh at that as they went over what gift cards would be used on Wendy, Carly, and Carl.<br />
<br />
A minute later the judge of the contest approached the two girls. He extended his hand, &quot;Hello, I must say I <br />
absolutely loved both of your performances today, I rarely get the chance to see two women of such quality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you.&quot; Wendy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm about to leave, but I didn't want to leave without talking to you both first. You see I am a talent scout <br />
and I'm out looking for people who meet...certain qualifications, and I offer them a chance to make it big in <br />
entertainment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy was hooked on every word, Carl knew she'd always had a secret desire to be like the people she saw on <br />
TV. Carl on the other hand was a bit more dubious. &quot;And what area of entertainment are you scouting for <br />
today?&quot;</p>
