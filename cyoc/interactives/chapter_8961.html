<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- Doctor Peter – by scriptboy (peter@powerfulboys.com) <br />
<br />
It all began when Ty and Dustin came home from school one afternoon. Neither had an umbrella with them, and both of them walked in the pouring rain to get into the house. Neither changed out of their wet clothes right away, and eventually the inevitable took place: Both Dustin and Ty caught a cold. <br />
<br />
Now Ty and Peter could have used their transformation powers to do something in order to prevent them from getting colds, but once they had them, they had to stick it out just like the rest of us, for their powers will only allow them to transform, not to heal themselves of illnesses after they have already become sick.<br />
<br />
Peter didn’t get home from school until an hour later, for he stayed late at school in order to finish some homework. When he got home, he heard both Ty and Dustin sneezing and coughing, and he realized that it was not a good sign. He checked the medicine cabinet and saw that there were neither cold pills nor aspirin in the house. So he put his poncho back on and grabbed his umbrella, and he walked to the grocery store, which was five minutes from their house.<br />
<br />
While he was walking down the aisle where the aspirins were located in the supermarket, Peter saw a familiar face. He saw Keith, the 5 foot 11 inch tall, 41-year-old nurse who worked in the hospital. Keith had done a body swap with Peter once before, and it was pure coincidence that they had met on that night.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter! How’s going?” Keith said with a smile on his face. Keith was pushing his grocery cart, while Peter was only there to buy some aspirin and some cold medicine, so he didn’t even bother to get a cart. “Hi Keith! Gosh it’s been a month since we met. I’m alright!” Peter answered. “I still need to take you up on your offer. I just haven’t had the time to contact you. There have been several instances where I wished I could just swap with you right there and then, but I had no way of getting a hold of you” Keith told him. <br />
<br />
Peter pondered it for a moment. “Well there are ways around that. I could make it so that whenever you say something or do something, we will swap bodies, no matter where we are. I just need to determine what it should be to initiate the body swap” he responded. <br />
<br />
“How about this: Every time I say ‘Body swap’ the two of us will swap our bodies instantly. And if we have already swapped our bodies, then we would swap back and end up back in our own bodies again?” Keith remarked, suggesting an easy way for him to swap with Peter without having to call him first. “Well that would work. However keep in mind that I might be at school and if you decide to swap with me then, you will find yourself inside of my body but at my school!” Peter said, reminding him of the possible scenarios of doing a swap with Peter at odd times of the day.<br />
<br />
“But could you allow me to swap with you at any time? That would be great!” Keith answered, hoping that the teen could grant him his request. “Yes, I can do that!” Peter responded, knowing the extent of his awesome transformation powers.<br />
<br />
“As a matter of fact, it would work out quite nicely, because both of my cousins sound like they are coming down with a bad case of the flu, so maybe you could care for them while I’ll take your shift at the hospital. I will need to have your medical knowledge, though” Peter said.<br />
<br />
“Great! Can we take care of this now?” Keith asked him. Peter looked at him straight in the eyes and said “I wish to have a copy of all you medical knowledge in my mind. And I wish that every time you say the words ‘body swap’ together, you and I will swap our bodies, no matter where we are physically. But you cannot swap with anyone else but me, and once we have swapped, saying the same words again will simply swap us back so that we are in our own bodies again”.<br />
<br />
“There, that’s done! You’re using my power, but you just initiate it by saying those two words. And you won’t be able to swap with anyone else but me! You can try it out a little bit later, okay?” Peter told Keith. Keith was very happy, and the adult and the teen shook hands and continued their grocery shopping. <br />
<br />
Peter had just gotten home, when he noticed that all was very quiet in the house. That was strange, because normally Ty and Dustin would be watching TV around that time. Peter walked into to Ty’s room and saw his cousin in bed. Then he quietly turned towards Dustin’s room, and he was in bed too! Peter then walked into his own room, and took off his poncho.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Keith had just gotten home in his apartment. He unpacked all his groceries and put everything away. He sat in his recliner and thought about what Peter had told him, and decided to give it a shot. He said “body swap” out loud, and he closed his eyes. When he opened them back up again, he found himself in the body of the teenager, in his upstairs bedroom.<br />
<br />
Keith was now inside of Peter’s body, and he loved every minute of it. He felt young, strong and energetic. He felt a little cold in the house, and he looked around Peter’s closet and put on a nice sweater, made out of thick wool. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, Peter was now in Keith’s body! Keith looked down at his adult form, and realized that a body swap must have occurred. Keith got up and grabbed a soda to drink, and sat down in the recliner to watch TV. He was still curious to what his body was doing, so he closed his eyes and concentrated. He was pleased with what he saw, for he noticed that Peter was now busy taking care of his two sick cousins at their house.<br />
<br />
“Good grief, Ty! You’re running a 100 degree fever! You need to stay in bed and drink lots of liquids and you need some vitamin C. I’ll pour you a big glass of orange juice!” Peter said to Ty, as he pulled the covers over his sick cousin. Ty looked tired, his eyes were all puffy, and he was coughing and sneezing a lot. Peter then walked over to Dustin’s room and saw that Dustin was doing even worse; he had a 101 degree fever!<br />
<br />
“Well it’s a good thing I’m here, you guys. Don’t worry; I’ll take care of you!” Peter said to Dustin, who was also sleeping on his bed.<br />
<br />
Peter gave both Dustin and Ty some cold medicine and told them to get some sleep. They each ha d a large glass of orange juices to drink and now they were both asleep. Peter walked back into his own bedroom and wrote a note on a piece of paper. He wrote down when Ty and Dustin had to take their medicine again, and he left instructions about their care while they were sick and in bed. <br />
<br />
Then Peter said “body swap” out loud and closed his eyes. When he opened them back again, Keith found himself sitting in his recliner in his living room, while Peter found himself standing in his bedroom, staring at a note that was written by him! He recognized his own handwriting and he followed the instructions.<br />
<br />
Peter woke up in the middle of the night to check Ty and Dustin’s temperatures, and he prepared glasses of orange juice for them to drink as well. He reminded them when they had to take their medicine, and he told them to stay in bed and to try to get as much sleep as possible. Ty woke up and sweat it out; his shirt was completely soaked in sweat. So he put on another shirt and went back to bed. Dustin woke up shortly after Ty, and he also had sweat all over his t-shirt. Peter took care of them and let them change shirts before going back to bed.<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin did not go to school the following day. Peter walked to school by himself, and he collected all the class notes and homework assignments for Ty and Dustin as soon as he arrived at the school. He then attended all his regular classes and had lunch in the cafeteria during the lunch break. <br />
<br />
Peter had just gotten into the classroom so he could take a biology test, when he suddenly found himself standing in the hallway of a hospital, wearing a nurse’s gown. Keith had wished for another body swap!<br />
<br />
Keith was now back in Peter’s body at school! He was sitting at a small desk. It was very quiet in the classroom, and Peter noticed that there were many anxious faces around the room. He realized right away that they were about to take a test! But it couldn’t be too hard; he looked around and noticed by the charts and graphs that were hanging from the walls that he was in biology class! Now that he was a nurse, he knew everything about biology! Peter was handed the sheet with all the multiple choice test questions, and he started answering them right away! He knew the correct answer right away and he finished taking the test in fifteen minutes, feeling confident that he had aced the exam.<br />
<br />
When biology class was over, Peter walked to history class, where they had another test! And the test covered American History in the 1980’s. What luck, Peter thought. He had lived through that era, and he knew every answer to every single question on the test. He figured that the real Peter would be very pleased, by the time they swapped back!<br />
<br />
After school was over, Peter walked home and decided to check up on Ty and Dustin right away. Peter checked Ty and Dustin’s temperature, and he was glad to see that the fever was gone. Both boys were still very tired, but at least it seemed like the worse had passed and they were now on the road to recovery.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Keith was walking down the halls of the hospital. He came by the room of one of his patients, a boy who suffered from pneumonia. He walked in and looked at the boy. Although Keith couldn’t heal him, he could change things to his body which would help him overcome the illness. The boy was about ten years old and he was as skinny as a board. Keith wondered how he could help the boy. <br />
<br />
First, Keith wished for the boy’s lungs to become stronger. The boy was now breathing normally again. Then Keith decided to add a little extra, by giving the boy almost 10 pounds of solid muscle. The boy’s pectorals and abdominals grew, his biceps became round like apples and his quads and his calves were suddenly huge. He now looked like a strong and healthy muscle boy!<br />
<br />
Next, Keith saw an elderly man who was in his 80’s. The poor man really had nothing wrong with him; he was just dying of old age! Keith had compassion on him, although he could not stop the man from dying of old age, he could postpone his death by regressing his age back by a few years. Keith concentrated, and the wrinkled faded away, his bald head now regained some of his hair, and his face now looked younger. Then the man turned towards Keith and whispered “Did you just make me younger?” Keith smiled and just nodded back. “Can you give me back my youth?” the man whispered. Keith just concentrated once more, and the man regressed further, down to his fifties, forties, thirties, and eventually into his twenties and then his teens. Keith decided to stop the age regression at 10 years old. The young kid still retained all his memory, but he was now only 10 years old and he was given the opportunity to live his whole life all over again, even while retaining the memories and the knowledge of his old life!<br />
<br />
Just as Keith walked out of the room, he suddenly closed his eyes, and Peter found himself back inside his own body again. Keith was back at the hospital, and he saw what had happened to his patients! Nobody could explain how one boy had overcome his pneumonia. What was even weirder was the fact that one elderly patient had completely disappeared from site, and they suddenly found out that there was one additional boy in the hospital, who was perfectly healthy! Keith wanted to get a hold of Peter, just to be sure of what he had done when he was in his body.<br />
<br />
Keith got into his car and drove to Peter’s house. There he got to see Peter again, and he also got to meet Ty and Dustin for the first time! “Thanks for taking care of my cousins” Peter said to Keith. “Well, thank you for helping my patients! Although nobody can explain what you did, but both boys are doing fine!” Keith returned. “And I think you’ll get good grades in Biology and in History, I aced those tests for you!”<br />
<br />
Peter was excited he knew Keith. They were able to help each other out! For both Peter and Keith this was one body swap experience they would never forget!</p>
