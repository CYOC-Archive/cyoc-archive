<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aye, Ye&#39;ve caught me laddie. I&#39;ll grant yer wish. If ye set me free to watch it come true, and the jockstraps of anyone effected by it.&quot; Chad was wanting to use his powers to mess with the boys anyway, this will just make them blame Tom for his word choice instead of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal! Wait, you want our jocks?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO TAKEBACKIES! We have a deal laddie and ye can&#39;t be going back on yer word!&quot; Chad screamed immediately incensed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, for a wish, that&#39;s fine, take it, its yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, then what&#39;ll ye be wish&#39;n for kiddo?&quot; Chad&#39;s magic now allowed him to free himself through the power of deals with the fae, he knew these people personally and knew their buttons to push, though in his transformed state, held no sentimentality for them. Tom was baby-faced despite being 18 and complained that he would would be mistaken for a kid until he retired. Chad was delighted to throw these jabs at him to keep Tom focused on himself rather than his crock o&#39; gold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whadya say guys? Muscle? Strength? To always have $500 in any pocket I put my hand in?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You&#39;ll be sharin&#39; the wish will ya?&quot; Chad coo&#39;d planting the idea that with proper wording everyone could get in on the magic. The group was suddenly more eager to chime in.<br />
&quot;A monster cock&quot; someone muttered getting some nervous giggles<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind being at the top of my weight class.&quot; another chimed in, getting some grunts of approval.<br />
&quot;Being naturally good at all sports.&quot;<br />
&quot;Make us all extra athletic!&quot; Someone said.<br />
&quot;Ugh guys! You&#39;re all just begging to be hypermasculine and manly! What about ending poverty, war, and famine? Fixing the climate? Instilling equality across races, genders, sexual orientations and identities? You&#39;re all acting like children!&quot;<br />
<br />
The room fell silent for a moment... &quot;Nah!&quot; someone muttered loudly and the rest of the group chuckled, &quot;Why waste a wish on the world when we can all become male underwear models or action movie heroes?&quot; another commented. &quot;Oh, I bet he&#39;s gay, that&#39;s why he wants them to have rights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By your logic, I must be Black or Mexican too, you&#39;re an idiot!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now now! Don&#39;t ye all be getting yer knickers in a twist. This be Tom&#39;s wish ta make, and I&#39;ve already bent the rules by wait&#39;n this long... So Tom, What&#39;ll ye be hav&#39;n?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, alright, I wish I was... no no no, we were, um manly, and extra masculine and uh...&quot; At Tom&#39;s confused hesitation there was an immediate uproar as words were spewed forth. Chad giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted as spoken! It&#39;s granted, now pipe down ya fir trua... pipe down.&quot; Chad screamed bringing the room to silence. Normally his magic is limited mostly to himself and minor tricks but asking for a wish is letting the leprechaun magic deep into the essence of not only yours, but even your loved ones existence. Chad felt complete power over the lives of not only the teens in the room but also the last several generations. <br />
<br />
Chad grinned mischievously at the teens, having complete control of them, he muted them magically and froze them in place. &quot;Let&#39;s see, extra masculine, what does that mean? What makes a man stand out among the rest? Men are hairy.&quot; Chad pointed to a freshmen who was training with the JV team today due to conflicts later in the week. As the rest of the boys turned to look at him a shockingly dense pelt of body hair erupted from him and a 5 o&#39;clock shadow was so thick it was nearly more accurately called fur, sprang into existence making him look like a baby faced 35 year old rather than a teen. The boy looked down at himself in horror, suddenly a freak among his peers.<br />
<br />
Chad repeated this process targeting a different boy with each different trait. Height made an exceptionally thin 10 foot tall boy, weight collapsed the boy to immobility and left him gasping for breath, the boy given wide shoulders became comically disproportionate, the kid who got muscle mass made Mr. Universe look like a novice. He doubled over in pain as his stomach growled, undoubtedly already needing 4-6 meals a day as a growing teen, before upping his caloric needs to mythic proportions. <br />
<br />
When he got to &quot;deep voice&quot; the boy was allowed to speak but soon his pleas for mercy dropped to an indistinguishable rumble before he was again silenced, another boy received a 5 foot long, 7 in diameter flaccid penis, the boy given grapefruit sized testicles had to cradle them constantly, the kid given the hyperactive libido stopped watching as other kids were targeted and just occasionally bucked his hips all the while panting heavily and staring off into space, the kid given the strong square jaw looked like a gorilla.<br />
<br />
Several of the boys were silently sobbing, horrified by their now far from normal circumstances. Still others had not yet been targeted and were nervously glancing back at the hairy freshmen, considering it the most manageable of outcomes. Chad cackled with laughter, &quot;You wished for this. Monster Cock boy, why aren&#39;t you happy? This was your suggestion!&quot; the boy was clearly sobbing and would probably collapse if not magically held up...<br />
<br />
Chad looked around at all the boys he&#39;d changed noting their equally dismal appearances. &quot;Aww, look at these guys,&quot; The group split between the transformed and untransformed. &quot;Your teammates look so sad, you should give them a hug and cheer them up.&quot; Chad forced the actions to be taken and as the untransformed boys hugged, each took a fraction of the transformation as each hug happened slowly returning the freakish boys toward normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, better? Maybe you lot should hug too.&quot; Chad said with a giggle having the transformed boys hug one another. When all was said and done, originally one or two in the group could have possibly been mistaken for a 20 year old, now, all would be pegged as mid to late 20&#39;s. Chad marched the boys to the locker room restroom where they got to see themselves. Their reactions were mixed as they realized they no longer fit in as kids, some were pleased, most were scared, a couple became erect embodying masculinity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now how do I make ye lot manly separate from your physical masculinity. Ah, of course!&quot; Chad hopped around summoning his magic to unleash on the boys as they shook their heads rightfully thinking things were about to get worse.<br />
<br />
The group looked like slightly more masculine than average men despite being a group of teenagers. &quot;Ta be manly, it helps with a strong foundation of being a man and not a boy.&quot; The group didn&#39;t realize they weren&#39;t aged until now and as the effects settled upon them, their bodies cranked it up another notch or two as they finished puberty, They all became more muscular, some became taller, some grew facial hair and not just stubble. One man looked in the mirror and came. The former freshmen was the tallest, widest, and hairiest among the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what do men do that boys don&#39;t? There&#39;s Jobs. Managing their finances, owning property&quot; Clothes of various forms appeared on the group, everything from burger uniforms to business suits, to jeans and tee shirts and hard hats. Wallets appeared on each of their persons and identification indicated that they were now all 21 year old men, car/apartment keys appeared in the pockets of those who didn&#39;t already have them but this went unnoticed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, oh yes, men like their stimulants,&quot; most of the men had coffee or an energy drink appear in their hands, some found that they possessed vapes, others had lit cigarettes, and two got lit cigars. &quot;Aw, and men like to self medicate their frustration away!&quot; A variety of beer brands, shots, and cocktails appeared taking the place of other beverages. A couple of the men had a hitter of cannabis sometimes with a drink and sometimes without. <br />
<br />
Most of the men looked uncomfortable about having substances that were illegal to them a moment ago, many also were appalled by the idea of becoming a caffein and/or nicotine addict, but if they tried to put out, throw away, or ignore whatever they received the magic of Chad the Leprechaun forced them to consume it, this went for all the changes. Once used, a cascade of mental changes occurred making this normal daily practice for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we be almost done, so lets keep going. Men have relationships.&quot; Memories burned themselves into the young men&#39;s brains. Strange acts of sexual pleasure with holes and various implements used as toys. As the mental changes stopped the guys looked at one another realizing they had new fetish filled desires extending way beyond their original orientation.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is feeling a bit cramped. Let&#39;s find some more space.&quot; With a snap of his fingers, the whole group was teleported to the parking lot of the high school. &quot;You lot can go but I have a special surprise for you Tom. The true culmination of manliness and masculinity. I don&#39;t want ya feeling your mates got more than you.&quot; Tom vigorously shook his head no but Chad paid no mind. The other men made a ring around Chad and Tom to see what would happen next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fatherhood!&quot; Chad cried. The vape Tom received was replaced with a pipe and Tom&#39;s weight increased as his features rapidly weathered. Gray hair appeared and quickly overtook him slowly turning white, he looked to be a man nearing 50. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this has been a good afternoon of work.&quot; With a final flick of his wrist, Chads crock appeared and countless jockstraps manifested above it exploding into gold coins as they fell in. &#39;Everyone effected&#39; by the spell included not just the boys turned men, but everyone at the jobs they now took, their families, and their friends. With payment completed Chad said a final &quot;Slán agat&quot; and ran away. The men released into the world with new memories of their lives... and desires.<br />
<br />
Tom looked to his former team members in terror, &quot;I have three kids. My first is 25, another&#39;s 16, both boys, and my girl is 12. I&#39;m married.&quot;  Tom held up his wedding band as proof. The group didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
