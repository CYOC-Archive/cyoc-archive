<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Part of you was still rather suspicious about the sudden visit of one of Queen Rafflesianna&#39;s daughters. Tulipelle&#39;s explanation that royal fairies were raised to be respectful of their subjects so to better care for them, sounded logical, and progressive monarchies on Earth had at times done some similar things so as to better care for their people, but there were still somethings that left you suspicious. Princess Ivyanna seemed to be more concerned with your power than your well being. Granted what many were saying might indicate that you were powerful, which would raise questions, but you didn&#39;t think wondering after your power and what you could do with it wasn&#39;t what one who was looking to help would ask.  Though, you put that aside for the moment, figuring that that was simply your human mind not knowing much about fairy society and their rules.<br />
<br />
The thing that you couldn&#39;t put aside was the fact that Princess Ivyanna had left her guards outside Tulipelle&#39;s home and had come to it in order to meet you. You and Tulipelle had been SUMMONED to come before Queen Rafflesianna, and whenever you had been in the Queen&#39;s presence, she had at least two guards near her, and usually Captain CometDust among them. You figured that fairy royalty would still follow similar protocol, some for their own protection and some for formality. After all, if your power was a potential risk... as if you might explode in a burst of uncontrolled magic, would going into an enclosed location without protection be the safe thing to do? Or if there wasn&#39;t enough known about you, would that be the safe thing. You weren&#39;t evil and had no wish to be, but if the Princess had only been told rumors about you, wouldn&#39;t it be smarter to have protection at all times to ensure that she was in no danger? Now, maybe that was simply a difference between human and fairy protocol, but then if that was the case, why did Queen Rafflesianna summon you and Tulipelle before her and why did she always keep at least two guards with her?<br />
<br />
However, as you followed Tulipelle, you put that on the back burner for the time being. While there were some things that you were suspicious of, you had to admit that you, as a changeling, weren&#39;t familiar enough on things to know for sure Ivyanna&#39;s reasons, and even if you did, she hadn&#39;t betrayed anything that would prove anything suspicious. So, you moved on to help Tulipelle clear her table and wash the dishes after dinner. It was an interesting process, as the pluming seemed to actually be tree&#39;s own veins in which sap normally moved. You were fascinated by it as you passed dishes to Tulipelle, as flowers, plants, and things like it seemed to be used for everything in fairy society. It was an amazing amount of engineering that probably depended heavily on fairy magic.<br />
<br />
That thought brought you back to one of the other concerns and wonders you had, which related to your own magic and everything that went along with it. The Queen wanted you and Tulipelle to become Enchantresses, and the Princess had said that the Enchantresses all lived in the palace. For the moment, that raised more and more curiosity in you.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, clean enough for now,&quot; Tulipelle smiled, as the last plate was left to soak in her sink, &quot;We can put them away tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded as Tulipelle turned and put an arm around you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how was your first full day as a fairy?&quot; Tulipelle asked, &quot;I hope the excitement didn&#39;t put you off staying with us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... well... I can&#39;t say I wanted all the excitement,&quot; you replied with a chuckle, &quot;but I won&#39;t be leaving any time soon... I&#39;d think you&#39;re worth all the excitement... given all that you&#39;ve done for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Irisette,&quot; Tulipelle smiled.<br />
<br />
You nodded as the two of you walked from the kitchen into what was more of a sitting room. The two of you sat down on a pair of rather soft chairs and you began to continue your answer to Tulipelle&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve earned a lot about magic and your world as a result of all the excitement, so that isn&#39;t entirely a bad thing,&quot; you continued.<br />
<br />
Tulipelle nodded, &quot;and a lot opened up for you... and for me...&quot; She gave a bit of a chuckle, &quot;being an enchantress... something I&#39;d never pictured myself being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither,&quot; you agreed, &quot;but then, I&#39;d have different reasons...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tulipelle nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I also have some questions about what the Enchantresses are... you say they&#39;re the Queen&#39;s most powerful subjects?&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are powerful in magic, yes,&quot; Tulipelle nodded, &quot;but they&#39;re usually the most knowledgeable on magic as well. In this they serve as advisers to the Queen issues related to magic. It&#39;s why they were critical in analyzing what we found out about the barriers and then countering it to reverse the damage that Jovek did...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said your knack allowed you to help diagnose the problem,&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It helped me diagnose the problem, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily I could fully counter what had been done,&quot; Tulipelle answered, &quot;even I&#39;d need more training to be able to counter what I&#39;d found out. I might have an idea... but ideas without training can be risky... and that&#39;s what the training to be an Enchantress will provide me... will provide BOTH of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can tell the Queen about magic... wouldn&#39;t that be talking down to her?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... think of it like court advisers on Earth,&quot; Tulipelle answered, &quot;we&#39;d have specific knowledge within specific areas of magic... or are powerful enough to be able to do more... and give the Queen advice based on that knowledge, power, or combination of both. Queen Rafflesianna would then take the advice from her Enchantresses and make her decision based on it... Just as a foreign minister might advise a King on Earth on the country&#39;s foreign policy. And they may not always be right. Queens can reject the advise of their Enchantresses if they feel wiser on a particular subject...&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded, &quot;and they all live in the palace?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be close at hand,&quot; Tulipelle shrugged, &quot;Similarly to how humans would place government buildings in their capital cities... our difference is to simply put them all together in one place, the palace, where we&#39;d be up to date on events in Gaia and help where we can and when we need to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t have to wear a uniform, will I?&quot; you asked, sounding a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have to wear a specialized dress that would mark you as an Enchantress, yes... but that&#39;d only be while you&#39;re on duty and/or actively advising the Queen on something,&quot; Tulipelle promised you, &quot;For the rest of the time... you&#39;d be able wear what you wish and go about your day... and love who you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt your wings beat reflexively at the mention of being able to love who I wished. It felt good to hear that.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t a bad thing, Irisette,&quot; Tulipelle then finished, &quot;to be asked to become an Enchantress as as a freshly transformed changeling... that&#39;s not something very common. Which means there is something very special about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only smiled.</p>
