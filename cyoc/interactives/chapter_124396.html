<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;At least the update you had will be some good news,&quot; Moe gave a heavy sigh, &quot;If they actually have something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll help secure the arrest warrants,&quot; Daniel said in warning, &quot;but for the moment, the only one they have is Albert. The rest are still out there and could still cause trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was enough to raise a heavy sigh out of Nichole. There was a lot about what they had run into in Moon Lake that had caught her off guard and on some level she felt a bit betrayed by the fact that old family friends had not been honest with them when urging them to come to Moon Lake. Saying that Moon Lake&#39;s were-beasts had control over themselves was one thing, but the fact that the Gambonis had kept them on the run for so long was enough suspicion on her part that not being upfront and honest about the town didn&#39;t sit right with her. On certain levels, she understood the reasoning that Daniel had given for why he didn&#39;t tell them from the beginning, but that didn&#39;t mean she had to like it.<br />
<br />
On certain levels there was also some amount of jealousy on Nichole&#39;s part that she didn&#39;t want to vocalize. Even though she was fully dressed, it was pretty clear that Francine&#39;s bust and hip measurements were much bigger than they were when the Brooks and Charlestons were last together. That left some level of jealousy on Nichole&#39;s part, though it was also something she didn&#39;t want to admit, either. As in theory, if jealousy was the only issue, Nichole figured that Daniel or Francine would offer a simply solution to that they become weres as well, which would fit Moon Lake&#39;s laws. That was not what Nichole wanted either.<br />
<br />
&quot;But all of you will be safe here,&quot; Francine assured them, &quot;I know there&#39;s a lot that will be on your minds with regard to Moon Lake and its laws... Daniel and I went through the same thing when we first moved in... but you WILL be safe here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And even if they make their way here, you should know I would do everything in my power to keep friends safe,&quot; Daniel assured both Moe and Nichole.<br />
<br />
Both of them had added that point of emphasis as both had heard Nichole&#39;s comments and how she talked to them on the issue. They could hear the suspicion in Nichole&#39;s comments and the negative look at the situation that Nichole had given. And while the comments were understandable given how little people really knew about weres outside of Moon Lake, that didn&#39;t mean that it didn&#39;t hurt. That the comments and tone didn&#39;t hurt both of the adult Brooks in a way, as they could both remember days gone by when the Brooks and the Charlestons made time to hang out and talk and have dinner at least once a week, if not more so. They could remember those good and fun days, and had hoped to get something of that back when they learned that they&#39;re friends had been on the run from mobsters. The hope was that the assurance from them would at least give them reason to regain whatever trust had been lost.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hope so,&quot; Moe answered with a small and weak smile, &quot;I&#39;d hope so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole didn&#39;t say anything but did manage to nod beside her husband. She had her feelings of betrayal, but the Brooks had been polite and had answered every question. She couldn&#39;t say for sure how truly honest the answers were, but on a certain level she couldn&#39;t fully place any real reason for Daniel or Francine to lie in their answers. As if they really had to follow these rules, they&#39;d likely find out about these sorts of things eventually anyway. That meant that lying in those answers would only be discovered after it happened, and in this Nichole was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt with regard to explaining Moon Lake and were society.<br />
<br />
However, she still wasn&#39;t that keen on joining were society and didn&#39;t feel that such a rule was a good or safe rule. She didn&#39;t feel that Moe needed to give up his humanity just to protect Karen and even Karen&#39;s curiosity seemed a bit unsettling. But with no where else to go, and with the Gambonis after them, even with one of them arrested, there was still the wasn&#39;t much option and that only further made her nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you&#39;d like, once you Karen enrolled in school, I can show you around,&quot; Francine offered to Nichole and Moe, &quot;show you the sights the town as and the beauty that it has. The parks... the town has a natural history museum and the college has museum of it&#39;s own that is all rather interesting. If you&#39;re interested in history, the college&#39;s history department has some records kept in the college Library that cover both Moon Lake&#39;s history and even some of the records of the groups that came here BEFORE Moon Lake was founded or before they came to Moon Lake if you&#39;re wanting to learn more about Moon Lake&#39;s and were history from a were&#39;s point of view.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Nichole answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But thank you for answering all our questions and concerns,&quot; Moe said to Daniel and Francine, &quot;but it is getting late. We should be getting home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll be by tomorrow morning to take you into the station when I go on duty. From there we&#39;ll see if we can get your phone de-bugged. If not... we&#39;ll see what we can do about getting you a new phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe nodded. The revelation that his phone had been bugged, but there was some assurance that the Gambonis apparently hadn&#39;t found them that way in Moon Lake. Of course that sort of dead zone might mean getting a new phone that had better reception anyway, which would mean writing down the numbers for his contacts for the ingredients for his pizza, but that&#39;d just be another thing he couldn&#39;t avoid. However, that&#39;d be something to handle tomorrow, and for the moment all that could be done would be to collect Karen and return to their new home. And while Moon Lake had its surprises, there was a lot that Moe was willing to do if it meant he could keep Karen safe, especially while the Gamboni family remained a threat, even with one of them arrested.<br />
<br />
Daniel then lead them to the back door so that they could collect Karen to head home. As they arrived there, they found Peter and Karen laying in the grass looking skyward. Peter had one arm raised and was pointing to various stars and managing to identify a few constellations. Both fathers found themselves smiling as Karen smiled and looked happy and Peter acted as Daniel described him... as a perfect gentleman. It was something that both father&#39;s could be proud in. And it was a sense of peace that was good for everyone. After a few moments, though, Peter paused his description of the stars  and looked toward the door that Daniel had opened. Karen eventually turned to look as well when she noticed that Peter had stopped describing the stars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, dad?&quot; Peter asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now?&quot; Daniel smiled, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it is getting late,&quot; Moe spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sure Peter has school tomorrow... there are some things that Mr. Brooks... Daniel... and I will need to handle... and you and your mother will have things to put in place so we can move in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter and Karen slowly got to their feat. Once back on her feet, Karen walked over to stand beside her father, though she couldn&#39;t help but look over her shoulder to look to Peter as they turned move through the Brooks home and giving him a small smile. As they moved she soon felt Moe&#39;s hand on the small of her back to usher her forward. They moved along and rejoined Nichole who stood by the front door. Peter and Daniel followed along behind them and rejoined Francine who&#39;d been quietly standing with Nichole as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you again for dinner and thank you for the answers,&quot; Moe said to Daniel as they were ready to head home, &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow morning. When do you need me to be ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My shift starts at six,&quot; Daniel spoke, &quot;If the department&#39;s tech officer can do the job, you&#39;ll be fine and I&#39;ll bring you back once done... If not... You may have to wait until we can contact Mrs. Stovall to come in and bring the computer genius that comes with Stovall systems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe slowly nodded, &quot;That&#39;ll be an early start... but I&#39;ll be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, the station has good coffee,&quot; Daniel told him.<br />
<br />
Moe slowly nodded and then lead his family out with Francine holding the door for them. He managed a small smile as they walked down the path to the sidewalk and then back toward the home they&#39;d just moved into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we&#39;ve certainly fallen down the rabbit hole, haven&#39;t we?&quot; Nichole broke the silence as they walked, &quot;a town full of weres... our old friends are one of them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s certainly a surprise, but with the Gambonis still out there... even with their &quot;tech guy&quot; arrested, this may be our only place to be safe,&quot; Moe answered, &quot;and while Daniel may not have mentioned the town being populated by were-beasts, he has consistently promised we&#39;d be protected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d trust these... weres wouldn&#39;t just turn Karen over to them?&quot; Nichole asked, &quot;We barely know any of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust Daniel,&quot; Moe spoke, &quot;He may of hid things related to weres... but the reasoning he gave for it makes some sense. And he was consistent in promising protection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole was quiet as they quietly walked toward their new home.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Peter was very polite,&quot; Karen spoke up, &quot;He told me a bit about what it&#39;s like... being a were... and why he eventually joined were society. I don&#39;t think his parents forced him. And he never tried to force himself on me. Unlike Marcus. We spent a lot of the time looking at the stars... It was... nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole only gave a frustrated sigh, &quot;I just don&#39;t know why WE have to become weres. Most of the world doesn&#39;t believe in them any more. Just have someone sign a waiver that makes them promise never to reveal it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is probably the concern over contracts and honesty,&quot; Moe commented as they reached their front door, &quot;Someone moves in and then later moves away... what&#39;s to stop him from revealing the secret when there is no family member being betrayed? Remember that there have been PLENTY of people who&#39;ve agreed to do things and then backed out or broke their promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Gambonis being one of them,&quot; Karen added, &quot;and even if the fears they have are either unfounded in the present day or are unnecessary... that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have the fears. In fact communities that have tried to shut themselves off in many ways... they&#39;ll tend to HOLD onto those fears, regardless of how rational it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end, it may be the thing that protects Karen from Marcus,&quot; Moe spoke slowly, &quot;We&#39;ve tried to keep her safe in places populated by normal humans and each time, the Gambonis were close behind and caused trouble forcing us to flee again. If becoming a were is what it takes to give Karen a chance to go through high school and college and be happy and not being fearful while looking over her shoulder for some leach of a man like Marcus seeking to kidnap her... that&#39;d be a price worth paying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole was silent in response to that. She did want to see Karen happy, but there was just soo much that was different. That wasn&#39;t normal and conflicted with everything she knew. There were so many stories of weres that generally portrayed them as monsters. In that, it would take quite a lot to show her otherwise.</p>
