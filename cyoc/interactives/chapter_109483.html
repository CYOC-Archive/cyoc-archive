<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Urial struggled vainly to free himself, but nothing would do. He was left all morning alone in the floor. Finally his dad came back in.<br />
<br />
“Dad. I&#39;m sorry. Just let me go now, please.” His dad bent down and did some measurements around his head.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll have you fixed and working in no time.” An odd way of saying it, but at least he was finally getting out. “I&#39;ll just need to pop into town and buy some supplies for it.”<br />
<br />
“What, are you stupid? Just use a sledge or something. At least go downstairs and untie me.”<br />
<br />
“Wash your filthy mouth. I&#39;ll fix you down in the basement as well.” And with that he left.<br />
<br />
Both his brothers were standing in the doorway. An excited, wicked smile on both their faces.<br />
“What?” Urial asked. Ashley looked like he was bursting to tell him something incredible, but Mark just placed a hand on his shoulder and shook his head. Ashley tittered. He was such a kid. Very easily excitable. Mark stepped forward, and stroked Urial&#39;s hair again.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s the password to your computer?”<br />
<br />
“What? No. Fuck off. I&#39;m not telling you that.” Mark nodded to Ashley who scampered off downstairs. A few seconds later, he thought he could feel something. An excited breath on his bare skin. Right by his crotch. Urial let out an unwilling moan. Now fingers, were delicately stroking his shaft. Urial quivered.<br />
<br />
“Aah ha ah ha...”<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s your password?”<br />
<br />
“No...” There were tears in his eyes now. He felt lips gently kissing his cock. “Mmmmmm!” Mark leaned in close to Urial and kissed him. Their tongues danced. Urial felt dazed. As he pulled apart again, Mark said in a gentle loving voice,<br />
<br />
“You know you belong to us now. What is the password?” Urial watched with glazed eyes and gave in with gasps and short breaths.<br />
<br />
“Bitch-boy150.” Mark pulled the laptop from his bag and typed in the password. It worked.<br />
<br />
“Good slave.” he said, stroking his hair. He was rewarded with the sensation of being sucked by his little brother.<br />
<br />
“Oh god! Yes!” he moaned.<br />
<br />
“Do you use any other passwords?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
“N... no. Ah! God! Bitch-boy150 for everything. Ah!” Tears were rolling down his cheeks of humiliation of pleasure. Mark sat on Urial&#39;s laptop for a while, doing things, he could not see. Down bellow he was still being played with. Teased. Sucked only gently. Tickled. It was too much to bare.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Please more. Harder please! I can&#39;t stand it.” But nothing he said effected anything bellow. Fingers played with his ass, but just enough to make Urial squirm.<br />
<br />
“Ah, you&#39;ve got quite the savings on your account. That&#39;s going to come in handy.” Urial tried to tell his brother to stay out of his bank account, but his mind was going numb and he found himself unable to protest convincingly.<br />
<br />
“There. All your accounts deleted. Money transferred. You no longer have money. Not a dime. Gmail and Facebook permanently deleted as well. After sending your friends some juicy stuff to make sure they&#39;ll never want to speak to you again. Not that I had to try very hard to make you seem like an ass.”<br />
<br />
“You bastard!” Urial mustered, the online social murder he&#39;d just committed pulling him a bit back to reality. “Just you wait until I get out of here.” Mark laughed and thumped the floor.<br />
<br />
“Did you hear that, Ashley? It thinks it&#39;s going somewhere.” Ashley&#39;s girly giggle was heard from bellow and felt on Urial&#39;s painfully hard cock. They were just messing with him, Urial knew. Dad was right now probably heading back from the store with what was needed to get him loose safely.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I spoke too soon. You have a Skype as well. Hmm... Oh my god! You have a boyfriend?”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s privet!” Urial snaps, but Mark was too busy reading through the messages and looking at the photos to answer. Bellow, Ashley perked up at the mention of Urial&#39;s boyfriend. Cruelly, he let his older brothers tortured cock hanging stiff in mid air as he ran upstairs again to get a look.<br />
<br />
“Wow. He&#39;s hot.” Ashley exclaimed. Urial had never known that he fancied guys, though it was no secret now. He&#39;d been enjoying Urial&#39;s cock for a full twenty minutes just now.<br />
<br />
“Wait. That&#39;s not all. He&#39;s got another boyfriend it seems. Oh, just as handsome.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Ashley said looking closer. “I knew Urial was spoiled, but two boyfriends at the same time?” Mark sniggered.<br />
<br />
“And they don&#39;t know about each other.” Ashley made an exaggerated show of being aghast.<br />
<br />
“Then we should introduce them to one another.”<br />
<br />
“No! Please. They&#39;d kill me.”<br />
<br />
“Yup, anyone&#39;d be pissed at finding out that they were being cheated on... And that they were being sent each other&#39;s privet photo&#39;s. Wow. You really are a bastard.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s... what they don&#39;t know can&#39;t hurt them.” His justifications sounded lame even to his ears.<br />
<br />
“I think I should look closer at your browser history and find out what more you&#39;ve been doing or have accounts on.” Urial hoped his dad would be back soon with his freedom. His brothers had gone over the line and then some. Enough was enough.<br />
<br />
“It looks at some really kinky porn,” Ashley said. “Oh and look. Such justice. It used to watch waterspouts. Guess it really does like its new role in life after all.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god. It even posted the pictures he was given on this porn-site.” Mark was going back and forth between Skype and Urial&#39;s web browser. “Look at this. He talked both of his boyfriends into reluctantly peeing in their own mouths on camera. You can see their faces and everything. Read the messages. They really didn&#39;t want to and only did it after days of asking. They really put their trust in you, Urial. Maybe I should link them this sight as well? Lett them know that you&#39;ve been posting their secrets online.”<br />
<br />
“No. Please!” Urial begged. I&#39;ll do anything. Anything you want.”<br />
<br />
“Well of course you will. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re in a possession to refuse anything. So it&#39;s hardly a bargaining chip, is it?” He stared typing up messages to both boyfriends in Urial&#39;s name.</p>
