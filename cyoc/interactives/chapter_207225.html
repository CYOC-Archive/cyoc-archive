<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“...Fine. It’s the best deal I’m going to get, right?” Sam sighed, absentmindedly running a hoof over his powerfully muscled forearm. It helped to ground him reality, to let him know that this wasn’t some bizarre dream or hallucination, that the black coat of short fur on his thick arm and the smooth dark hooves tipping each three-fingered hand were <i>his</i> to use however he wanted to. “But, you guys really gotta work on your sales pitch. A less trusting guy than me might think you were strong-arming me into this just so you could get a new worker on your team.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? As if an old hog like me could even <i>think</i> of threatenin’ a big stallion like you,” Zeke replied, one corner of his lip curling up into a smirk that showed off the entire length of his big tusk. “But, like I said. The job’s yours if you want it. With a strong fella like you helpin’ out, we could be done with this apartment by tomorrow evenin’. And I could forward you yer first week’s pay in advance, plus a sign-on bonus. Might help ‘ya get some new clothes to replace those tiny little ones you’ve got.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll think about it,” Sam replied flatly. His heart was beating a thousand times a minute, but he kept his face and voice as even as he could to avoid tipping his hand.<br />
<br />
Zeke looked him over one last time before grunting and turning to leave. “Come on Gio, Hank. Back to work,” he called back to his workers, and the skunk and wolf let out matching sighs of relief that Sam seemed to be taking things so well. They’d heard about what could happen when their little ‘upgrades’ didn’t go according to plan, and it was rarely pretty. And with Sam turning into such a strong animal as a horse, the possibility for someone to get hurt if they weren’t careful had always been there.<br />
<br />
“You lucked out, Gio,” Hank laughed once Zeke was out of the room. “When you went straight for the horse capsule, I was about to say you were making a mistake. But, he turned out alright… Just don’t let your picky ‘<i>tastes</i>’ cause a problem like this again, ‘kay?”<br />
<br />
Gio’s ears went red and flattened against his head while his tail whipped frantically behind him. The wolf was a big guy, but at the moment his body language made him look just like an overgrown puppy in Sam’s eyes. Or, maybe that just had something to do with Sam’s massively increased height.<br />
<br />
“’Tastes’? You mean that he’s got a thing for horses?” Sam asked curiously, glancing over at Gio and seeing nearly seething with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Hank, don’t you dare-”<br />
<br />
“Sure, he likes horses. And deer, rams, bulls, rhinos, you name it,” Hank pressed on despite Gio’s complains. “Big, buff herbivores with biiiiiig dicks. But, that&#39;s not really what I mean by &#39;taste&#39;. See, Gio&#39;s got this crazy theory that when a guy only eats plants, he tastes-”<br />
<br />
“Hank! I swear to god, just get out of here!!” Gio exploded, grabbing the skunk’s big tail and literally dragging him out of the room, tossing him into the hall, and slamming the door before sheepishly returning to where Sam was waiting. “Sorry about him… He’s still sore that things never worked out between me and him when we were dating.”<br />
<br />
“’Cause he’s not a horse?” Sam teased, making Gio roll his eyes. Sam walked over to a mirror on the wall and did a few stretches, if only to get a better look at how much he had changed thanks to Gio and Hank’s meddling. <br />
<br />
He would never say it out loud, but there was something deep down that was loving this. With the so-called dampener no longer clouding his mind, Sam could truly take in how different his body felt. How <i>powerful</i> he felt towering over the other men in his apartment once he reared up to his full 6’10”, and how <i>virile</i> he felt knowing his maleness would make even the most well-endowed male blush with envy. Sure, it meant having to be a horse instead of a human being, but Sam had already spent thirty years as a human. Time for something new, and he could definitely have gotten stuck with something worse than a horse.<br />
<br />
But, again, he wasn’t about to admit all that to Gio, Zeke, or Hank. Maybe if they’d asked his permission first, sure, but Sam was a bit sour about having his head messed with like they’d been doing earlier.<br />
<br />
“...You know, you look better this way,” Gio piped up, making Sam nearly jump. He’d almost forgotten the wolf was still there. “Maybe I’m just being biased, but humans… kinda boring. But <i>you</i>… I mean, just look at you…”<br />
<br />
Without even realizing what he was doing, Gio reached out his paws and stroked the front of Sam’s chest, letting his soft paw-pads glide over the horse’s coat and brush across the sizable nipples peeking out from under the brownish fur on Sam’s pecs. The wolf just couldn’t control himself, thanks to an irresistible combination of the pheromones still lingering in the apartment and his own unique fetish for muscular herbivores like Sam.<br />
<br />
“G-Gio, don’t you have to get back t-”<br />
<br />
Sam’s protest was silenced as Gio stood on the tips of his paws to press his muzzle against Sam’s, slipping his smooth canine tongue into Sam’s mouth and entwining it with Sam’s. “<i>Hush, I’m on break</i>,” Gio half-mumbled and half-moaned through the kiss, gently pushing Sam backwards toward the living room until they both collapsed onto the couch with their tongues still dancing back and forth between one anothers’ muzzles.<br />
<br />
When Gio finally broke the kiss, Sam only caught a glimpse of the wolf’s grinning face before it dipped down past Sam’s chest. Gio playfully gripped the waistband of Sam’s pants in his teeth and slowly tugged them down, releasing the pent-up scent of sweat and arousal from beneath as Sam’s half-erect horse-cock once again flopped out and slapped against Gio’s drooling muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Even better up close… fuck, you’re driving me insane, man…” Sam could heard Gio muttering deliriously between his legs, clearly out of his mind with pure arousal.<br />
<br />
“Gio, slow down a bit, you’re-” Sam started to say, but with a sudden bestial growl Gio began to frantically run his long tongue along Sam’s pendulous ballsack, starting at bottom and slowly moving up along the underside of Sam’s dick until he reached the drooling tip. With each pass of the wolf’s tongue from bottom to top, Sam could feel himself getting more and more erect, more and more aroused, more and more at ease in the sexy new body he had been gifted. Unlike when he was a human, Sam didn’t get fully erect in an instant. Rather, every pulse of his heart sent another rush of blood into his massive dick, slowly inflating it like a throbbing balloon and letting him truly enjoy the sensation of becoming fully engorged.<br />
<br />
When Sam was rock-hard and ready to go, Gio wasted no time in opening his jaws wide and taking as much as he could into his warm, moist muzzle. Sam heard a moan from the wolf as the first drop of precum touched his tongue, urging him on to keep on taking more of Sam’s considerable length into his canine muzzle. When Sam felt the tip of his cock hit the back of Gio’s throat, he instinctively let out a loud neigh and stomped his hooves against the floor. He was sure half the building heard, but he was so fucking horny that he didn’t even care. Gio expertly slid his entire tongue up and down Sam’s entire shaft, sucking and teasing the newly-minted horse like a pro. Since Sam had only been a horse for barely half an hour at this point, he was completely unused to the level of what he was feeling being pleasured like this, and as much as he tried to hold off he finally felt his orgasm reaching its peak as he unleashed a seemingly unending torrent of horse cum down Gio’s throat. The wolf’s eyes rolled back and his cheeks bulged with the volume of sperm filling his mouth, and while he managed to swallow some, the vast majority just drooled out the sides of his mouth and dribbled down his chest.<br />
<br />
“Damn… Nectar of the fucking gods, right there…” Gio finally moaned as he fell backward onto the floor, his tongue lolling to the side as he grinned deliriously. “Hank thinks I’m nuts, but herbivores really do have the best-tasting cum. Sweet, creamy, and not  even a hint of bitterness…”<br />
<br />
“So, you’re saying I should turn Zeke down and just go into business bottling my own jizz?” Sam chuckled as he stuffed his slowly-softening cock back down the front of the work pants he’d been loaned. Even though the pants had much more room in the front than his last pair, his massive horsehood still made a noticeable bulge that Sam playfully patted. He spotted a nearby towel and tossed it to Gio, who reluctantly began to wipe away the cum form his face (but not without making sure to take a deep inhale from the cum-soaked towel before setting it aside).<br />
<br />
“Well, <i>I</i> think it’s a good idea, but I’m a weirdo with a kink. You might want to have a plan B just in case it doesn’t work out,” Gio laughed, leaning in and softly licking the side of Sam’s muzzle affectionately. “Incidentally, you might want to save up to replace that fridge in your kitchen with a bigger one. That new body of yours runs on pure fresh veggies from now on, and the wimpy little crisper drawer in most refrigerators aren’t up to the job.”<br />
<br />
“Gee, <i>thanks</i>. I can forgive you turning me into a horse, but making me buy new clothes and new appliances is taking things too far.”<br />
<br />
“Sam… You’ll take the job, right?” Gio asked suddenly, standing up and walking over to the hulking anthropomorphic horse he had helped to create. The muscular wolf wrapped his arms around Sam’s thick torso and pressed his snout into the thin coating of fur covering Sam’s body, inhaling deeply of the thick scent clinging to the equine after their quickie. “You’d be a lot of help, y’know. I know you feel a little weird about what we’re doing to people, but we need to make these changes or anthros like us won’t have a place to go.”<br />
<br />
“...And if I did join the construction team, you’d have a buff horse to ogle whenever you got bored, right?” Sam replied softly.<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah, of course. But I’m serious here, Sam. You’re an anthro now, just like me, Hank, and Zeke. Not a human being. And if you can get used to this, so can the rest of the world. And if they can’t… Well, someday it&#39;ll be your problem too,” Gio said calmly as he let his arms fall to his side and started to head toward the front door of Sam’s apartment. “Look, my break’s over so I’m gonna get back to work. You know where to find me if you make your decision.”<br />
<br />
Gio took a quick look in the mirror to make sure he was presentable to his boss and coworkers, then he took one last glance back at Sam before heading out of the room with his tail wagging cheerfully behind him.</p>
