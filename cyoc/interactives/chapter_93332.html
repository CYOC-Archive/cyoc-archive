<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days before...<br />
<br />
Martin Gorman was a janitor at the local high school.  Life had not made him a very lucky or happy man.  He was in his mid-40s, had a menial job that didn&#39;t pay very well.  He&#39;d dropped out of college to take care of his late parents&#39; beloved family bookstore business many years before.  After years of struggling the bookstore just couldn&#39;t keep up with the modern times, and it went out of business, leaving Martin bankrupt.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d slowly been recovering, trying to work his way out of dept, but the years showed only a little progress.  He&#39;d dated a few times, but had never been able to hold a steady girlfriend either.  He was too shy and awkward to allow things to get very far.<br />
<br />
Today, though, his luck was changing...<br />
<br />
Martin swept the halls after school.  The final bell of the day had rung a little while before and the school was mostly empty, save for a few teachers still working in their classrooms.  As he continued his work, mopping the halls and taking the trash, before moving on to the cafeteria.  As he swept under a table he swept out an interesting little piece of paper which seemed to have some fancy writing on it.  Curious, Martin picked it up and began reading:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so bored, just sitting there. Here&#39;s a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking closer, Martin saw there was a question written next:<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
What?  Though Martin.  This was a weird question here on this weird note.  Martin had never any reason to consider how he might be as a woman...  He wouldn&#39;t think he&#39;d be all that much different than he was now.  Maybe with just a few aesthetic improvements... Still curious, Martin took his pencil from behind his ear, and scratched down an answer...<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  It would be swirly and feminine, but messy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Martin noticed the piece of paper was folded a bit.  Unfolding it, he revealed a long list of similar questions.  Thinking he had time and enjoying the little thought exercise, Martin sat down and began filling in answers in earnest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t like it, but nor would I hate it.  Every color has its place.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was an answer that was already true.  Indeed Martin still didn&#39;t see any reason he would think differently about this if he was a woman.  What Martin didn&#39;t notice was that he was writing faster, and his writing looped around in great feminine swirls that looked like a preteen girl&#39;s handwriting.  It would have been hard to read, if Martin had tried.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
&quot;Straight,&quot; wrote Martin, thinking simple and easy would be best.  He didn&#39;t notice as his own messy curly hair suddenly fell into flat strands on his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?<br />
<br />
&quot;None specifically, but I&#39;d like earthy tones, like browns, dark greens, and grays.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Chestnut brown,&quot; he wrote.  His sandy colored hair darkened to become the chestnut brown he had imagined.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; he wrote.  He liked interesting eye colors, and had an affinity for the somewhat unusual golden honey colored eyes he had occasionally seen.  His eyes changed to match that color as he wrote.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like make-up?<br />
<br />
Again Martin wanted to keep things simple.  &quot;Yes, but nothing too crazy.  I&#39;d prefer simple make-up styles and more neutral colors which would accentuate my cute freckled face.  I&#39;d also like earthy toned nail polish.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bit describing his face just kind of came out as he wrote.  He was starting to see a picture in his head of this dream girl he was writing about.  As he put his pen to paper for the next question, Martin suddenly took note of his hands... the nails had brown nail polish on them!  Surprised Martin looked around, thinking maybe he&#39;d gotten his hands dirty on something.  But no... it turned out it was definitely nail polish which was carefully applied.  As he gawked he suddenly became aware of the straight brown bangs which hung into view from his head.<br />
<br />
Scared, Martin ran into the nearby restroom and looked in the mirror.  The mirror confirmed the change to his hair, and told also of his now stunningly cute feminine face, which was simply but tastefully made up in neutral colors, and bore freckles that only made it look even more adorable.  Shocked and horrified, Martin began to run from the restroom, fearing some evil magic or that he&#39;d become the subject of some dangerous scientific experiment.  As he ran he suddenly slipped on a piece of paper that was on the ground in his path, and he nearly fell backwards to the floor, only just managing to balance himself.  <br />
<br />
Looking at the source of his near-fall he saw the piece of paper... THE piece of paper.  It had the list of questions, partially filled out with his answers.  Somehow it had gotten from the table in the cafeteria to here in the restroom doorway.  It also looked like it bore new writing.  Picking it up Martin read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not stop. If you continue, your dreams will come true. But if you stop, you will meet an unpleasant end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Martin had to think.  Some kind of fearful magic power was changing him with this note.  Something that forbade him from stopping, lest something more fearful happen.  But at the same time, it promised good to come if he continued.  Martin wasn&#39;t stupid.  He could already see where the note was going.  If he continued, he&#39;d end up as a woman.  &quot;But...&quot; he thought.  &quot;Would that be so bad?  ...I might like being a woman...  It certainly couldn&#39;t be worse than my life now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin made up his mind.  He picked up the paper and returned to the cafeteria table, where his pencil still lay.  He sat down, picked it up, and continued the questionnaire...<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I&#39;d stay in shape.  I&#39;d like a few outdoors-ey sports like hiking, surfing, boating, and fishing.<br />
<br />
This was a change compared to Martin&#39;s current self.  But, he thought, it was a change for the better.  And he certainly thought that he should make himself better with the magic of this note, if he was able.  Martin&#39;s body shrunk from overweight to fit with some muscles.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
&quot;Often, but not always.  And it wouldn&#39;t hurt my feet when I do.&quot;  Martin didn&#39;t mind this bit of a feminine touch to the dream girl he was becoming.  In fact, it excited him a bit.  His shoes turned into a pair of simple black 3-inch pumps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, frequently.  Though I&#39;d be okay with many styles of clothing.&quot;  At this point Mark decided to try something... even though it wasn&#39;t the point of the question, he wrote on to describe his future female self: &quot;I tend to wear feminine business attire most days because I work here at the school as a librarian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin&#39;s pants turned into a brown pencil skirt which constricted his leg movement a bit.  He found he didn&#39;t mind it, however.  As for the rest of what he wrote, Martin didn&#39;t notice if anything had changed or not.  He&#39;d have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, simple jewelry.  I wear a necklace, sometimes a bracelet, a ring or two, and a pair of earrings.  I have a penchant for dangly earrings.&quot;<br />
<br />
A simple silver chain necklace appeared one Martin&#39;s neck.  A ring appeared on his left index finger which was silver with a small semiprecious stone.  Martin felt two dangly earring tickling the sides of his neck as he turned his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?<br />
<br />
Oh.. here&#39;s the point of no return, Martin knew.  He gulped, and hesitated for a moment.  He thought it all over again: &quot;Is this worth it?  Should I go through with this?&quot;  Martin&#39;s hesitation ended, when he realized that a second ring had appeared on his right index finger... which was a simple decorative signet ring that Martin knew were given to librarians in the area.  This meant... Martin really could change his life for the better with this note!  He wrote down his answer, determined to be happy with the outcome... no matter what.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-cup, perky, and sensitive.&quot;  Martin didn&#39;t feel like he needed to go all out.  Nevertheless, when his chest swelled out to form his new, cute, perky breasts, they felt like an enormous weight compared to before.  He felt them with his hands, and gasped... they really were sensitive!  He stroked them and teased his nipples a bit, which stood to attention; the feeling gave him shivers of delight.  As he moved and readjusted his balance, he found he was quickly becoming used to their weight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?<br />
<br />
Martin pondered.  He didn&#39;t like the idea of being into guys, but was trying to think if there was any reason he should change that.  Eventually he couldn&#39;t think of any reason why this would be necessary for his new life as a woman, so he wrote his answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I&#39;d be 100% lesbian, and I&#39;d like feminine girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;d shave my legs and armpits, and I&#39;d trim my pubic hair.  I usually trim it to a landing strip, but sometimes I&#39;d shave it completely, if I knew a particular partner had any strong preference for it.  I wouldn&#39;t like to let my bush get out of hand.  Also, my body hair would be sparse and grow slowly so it wouldn&#39;t grow too fast for me to keep up with it.&quot;  Martin felt embarrassed to write these things, but this was the truth of what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Martin&#39;s leg and armpit hair disappeared, making him feel extra smooth all over his body.  He liked the feeling.  His pubic area also felt smoother than it ever had, though a quick check confirmed that a landing strip of brown hair had been left.  Martin moved on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?<br />
<br />
And here it was, Martin realized, that he would become a woman.  He wrote &quot;Tampons.&quot;  His hard member immediately shrunk.  His balls ascended into his pelvis, and his innards rearranged themselves and transformed.  Martin felt a wetness between his legs.  He reached down below and felt his new feminine sex.  He felt the feminine folds, he felt as his finger pushed into his new vagina, and he gasped at the pleasure he felt.  He felt some more and found his clit.  Touching it sent a jolt of pleasure through his body and he had to suppress a shout of pleasure.  This was amazing!  He loved the feelings he was having!  <br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t time to explore now, though.  He had to complete the transformation, so he looked back at the note.  As he did, Martin realized that there was no reason to think of himself as a &quot;he&quot; anymore, and he... she realized that from now on, &quot;she&quot; was the now the correct pronoun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 16: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
<br />
&quot;A feminine blouse that matches my skirt, with a matching business appropriate cardigan over it.  The blouse would be low enough cut to show off a little bit, but not overly so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin looked as his shirt changed to be as he described.  It turned into a white frilly blouse that showed off some cleavage, the sight of which tickled Martin&#39;s senses.  Over the blouse an earthy green cardigan appeared, with a few black stripes in just the right places.  Appreciating his new attire, Martin continued.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?<br />
<br />
&quot;Any of these would be fine, but I would frequently go without any of them.  Doing so would not cause any rubbing or other harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin felt her underwear disappear.  Nothing replaced them, but she felt comfortable.  She crossed her legs under the table and read on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;8,&quot; wrote Martin.  She wanted to be pretty smart.  &quot;Since I&#39;m a librarian I&#39;m an expert with books, literature, linguistics, and art.  I&#39;m also a great writer despite my messy penmanship.  I write lesbian-mystery-romance novels on the side along with being a librarian.&quot;  All of the knowledge flowed into Martin&#39;s head, and she enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m wearing a standard push-up bra with no underwiring.  I like bras that amplify my cleavage.&quot;<br />
<br />
A push-up bra appeared on her chest.  Her breasts showed more prominently behind her blouse, and this made Martin happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes? (Don&#39;t lie)<br />
<br />
&quot;29 years old.  5&#39;3&quot;, and 121 lb.&quot;  Martin&#39;s body shrunk by a lot.  She became a petite little beauty with a cute, femininely curved body.  She enjoyed feeling younger again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 21: If you were a girl... what type of shoes are you wearing?<br />
<br />
Martin liked the black pumps she was wearing now, so she wrote &quot;These shoes are fine.  I like to wear any kind of feminine shoes, as well as cute hiking shoes for when I&#39;m doing outdoor activities.&quot;  Martin&#39;s shoes didn&#39;t change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 22: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wear a pair of sexy librarian-style, pointy glasses.  My vision is pretty terrible without them, but when I wear them I see very well.  I like the librarian look so even though I own contacts, I rarely use them.  I do have to use them occasionally while doing outdoor activities.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sexy librarian glasses appeared on Martin&#39;s face.  She felt totally comfortable with them on.  She took them off for a moment and everything became blurry, so she replaced them quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 23: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
&quot;It would extend to my mid-back.  I would keep it simple, often just letting it lie straight with a few clips or pins or a headband to keep it out of my face and looking nice.  I&#39;d also wear it in a pony-tail when I need it to be even more low-maintenance.  I frequently put a bow, flower, or ribbon in it to help it look cute and feminine without adding too much work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin&#39;s hair grew out to match her description.  She felt something in her hair, and reaching to grab it she found a yellow daisy.  She replaced it perfectly, and it looked adorable.  Martin looked at the final question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 24: If you were a girl... what would your name be?<br />
<br />
Martin wasn&#39;t too particular about names, and she wrote a nice feminine name without pondering too much about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Leah Michelle Gorman.&quot;<br />
<br />
She kept the same surname.  Leah read the last line on the note.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to have a happy life as a woman, pass this on to the next person. Male or female, it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Leah took the note and placed it in her black purse, which had appeared next to her.  She then took the purse, got up and headed back to the restrooms so she could get a look at her handiwork.  When she arrived, she entered the women&#39;s restroom.  Looking into the mirror, Leah took a sharp breath.  Wow, she was cute!  <br />
<br />
Before her in the mirror stood an image of a petite woman wearing a sexy librarian&#39;s business outfit, complete with a pencil skirt which accentuated the feminine curve of her ass and legs.  Her face was adorable with a small nose and freckles, as well as her sexy, pointy glasses.  Her hair hung straight to her mid-back, kept in place by hairpins.  On her head sat a yellow daisy which brought an air of feminine youthfulness to her look.  Her breasts moved with every breath, eye candy for anyone who cared to note her exposed cleavage.<br />
<br />
Leah could hardly believe her eyes.  This woman was her.  She looked and felt amazing.<br />
<br />
Looking in her purse Leah found a few things which matched her new life: keys to the school and library, her wallet which contained her teaching credential, her ID, her library cards, and some cash, among a few other member cards to various businesses.  Her ID showed her name, birth date, and description just as Leah had laid out on the note.  Leah also found a topo map of the surrounding wilderness, with trails and notes hand-drawn in, by herself, she realized.  She also found a few pens, and a couple books.  One was called &quot;The Closet Case&quot;.  Leah realized this was her first published book, a mystery about a female detective who solves a murder and ends up coming out as a lesbian in the process.  The other book was a recent Stephen King novel, which Leah realized was what she was currently in the middle of reading.<br />
<br />
Leah realized that new memories had formed within her to match her new life.  She thought back and realized that she was a nerdy girl as a child, whose nose was always stuck in a book.  She attended college hoping to become a teacher, but later became interested in library sciences due to her love of books.  She had graduated with her masters a few years ago and hadn&#39;t taken long to find the librarian position she held now at the school.  <br />
<br />
For a nerdy girl she enjoyed the outdoors more than one might expect.  She new all of the local trails and the best fishing spots, and she frequently went surfing down at the beach on the weekends.<br />
<br />
She had a few boyfriends in high school and college but the relationships never lasted long.  She had a fling with a girl once while on a fishing retreat out of state, and it was then that she learned she was a lesbian.  She had come out to her parents, who were surprised, but accepted her.  After that she had several relationships with women, but nothing that lasted, and she was currently single.<br />
<br />
She thought and realized that the tragedy of her parent&#39;s death had occurred even in this life, and the family bookstore had indeed passed to Leah.  Leah realized she didn&#39;t have the skills and resources necessary to manage the store, so she gifted all of the books to local libraries, then sold the building to a historical society who were interested in using the old building as a museum.  Leah had turned a profit because of the sale, and used the proceeds to benefit local children&#39;s after-school programs.  Leah was generous with her time and money, and as a result was not rich herself, though she lived comfortably in a moderately-sized condo in a decent part of town.<br />
<br />
Leah liked who she had become.  The note had not lied... her dreams had come true.  The note had made her a better person, so she decided to pass the note on, as it had requested.  She walked out of the bathroom into the hallway, took the note from her purse, and pushed it between the slits of a random, unadorned locker.  <br />
<br />
She then headed out to her home, ready to begin her new life as a woman.  As she did, she passed a young man who was pushing her old janitor&#39;s cart.  The young man appeared to be still in his teens, and he perked up at seeing Leah.  &quot;Hey, thanks Ms. Gorman, for helping me get this job after school!&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah&#39;s new memories guided her answer.  &quot;Of course, Richard.  Just be sure you put the proceeds toward getting into a good college!  You&#39;re too bright a guy to waste in a job like this forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I will, ma&#39;am!&quot; said the enthusiastic Richard.<br />
<br />
And with that, Leah headed home.  She still wanted to fully explore her new body...<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
A few days later, Leah was sitting in the school library hard at work, when the chemistry teacher, Katherine Bates, walked in.  Leah had taken note of Katherine over the last few days, and was taken with how beautiful, smart, and charming she was.  Unfortunately, Leah had no idea how to approach the subject of a date with her.  Surely a woman like that would have to be straight... or so Leah thought.<br />
<br />
Today Katherine approached the desk Leah was working at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Leah,&quot; she said.  &quot;I just came in to check on the chemistry section.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Katherine. I&#39;m sure the chemistry section hasn&#39;t changed since last time you checked...&quot; Leah responded, a little befuddled by the strange request by the beautiful woman in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s probably true...&quot; said Katherine.  &quot;I suppose there was another reason I came in....  Would you be interested in grabbing a bite to eat this evening? Maybe we&#39;ll even have a bit of chemistry...?&quot;  Her voice was playful as she made the dumb joke.<br />
<br />
Leah giggled at it, but was taken aback by the forwardness of the request.  She stuttered &quot;...What? How did you know...? And you...?&quot; Leah was so flustered. <br />
<br />
Katherine cut in: &quot;Yes Leah, I like women, and I know you do too. And I think you are very beautiful, and in talking with you I&#39;ve come to like you. So what do you say? Go on a date with me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Leah got over her shock and responded happily &quot;Well, of course! And, I think you are beautiful too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a date then,&quot; Katherine confirmed.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
And so had Leah come to meet Katherine.  They had both been changed into women by the note, and both were very happy about it.  They had new lives that they greatly enjoyed.<br />
But now, for the first time, two people shared the knowledge of the magical note...</p>
<hr/><h3>
