<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I need a shirt.&quot; Isaac suddenly said as he entered to the room. Since they&#39;re six boys living in their house, Jim&#39;s parents had decided to divide them in pairs for each bedroom. Naturally, the twins went together, so Jim ended up with Isaac who was older than him by 5 years, so he felt like the unluckiest one since then. &quot;Where&#39;s my shirt?! I left it on here!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s my stuff!&quot; Jim yelled at his brother when he began to throw away his toys and videogames. However, Isaac didn&#39;t care about it and he made a mess in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! I&#39;m going late!&quot; Isaac yelled before he left the room looking for some shirt in another place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isaac is an idiot!&quot; Jim shouted while he was cleaning the mess his brother left. &quot;Why can&#39;t we get along like Walt and Cal or Wyatt and David?&quot; Then, he noticed the magic balloon that had fell on the ground and he got an idea. He took it, blew in it and then he said. &quot;Control Isaac&#39;s age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! It isn&#39;t here!&quot; Isaac yelled why he looked for his shirt in the laundry machine. He was too busy with it that he didn&#39;t notice that he was getting smaller and smaller. As he was wearing just a pair of tight boxer briefs at that time he didn&#39;t feel anything weird, nor his height was decreasing nor his body hair was vanishing. &quot;I remember! I have a similar shirt under my bed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim had stopped using the balloon a few ago when a kid entered into his room. At first, he didn&#39;t recognize him but when he realized that the kid was wearing just some baggy boxer briefs he knew it that only one person in his house use to do that, Isaac.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s here!&quot; Isaac said in a way more higher voice that almost made Jim to burst into laughter. Maybe he went too far with the balloon, his brother looked ten years younger, he seemed even younger than Walt and Cal!<br />
<br />
&quot;Isaac, are you alright?&quot; Jim asked while he hid the balloon in his pants pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I&#39;m late for my date!&quot; Isaac yelled at his brother before he put his shirt on. It didn&#39;t take him too long to realize that something was wrong. The shirt was way more bigger than he remembered. He looked around and noticed that Jim was staring at him but instead of looking at him from above, he was looking from below. Jim began to laugh when Isaac screamed like a girl after discovering that he was smaller.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?!!&quot; Isaac panicked while he checked on his body, his muscles, his body hair, everything that he had got after puberty was gone. &quot;Shit!!&quot; He yelled in his childish voice before he checked inside his boxers and realized that his proud had shrunk too. &quot;Oh fucking shit!!&quot; He yelled again and Jim can&#39;t avoid but laugh again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You! You did this to me!!&quot; Isaac yelled at Jim when he saw that he was laughing. &quot;Change me back! I have a date with the leader of cheerleaders!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did nothing! I swear.&quot; Jim lied. &quot;I&#39;m laughing because it&#39;s funny! You&#39;re smaller than me! That shirt won&#39;t fit on you, wear some of Walt or Cal&#39;s clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I think you&#39;re right.&quot; Isaac said before he left the room again. This time, Jim was following him. When they came into the twins&#39; room, Isaac looked for some decent clothes but all he found were superheroes and animals t-shirts. &quot;This is pure shit! I won&#39;t wear these clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can go around as you&#39;re right now. It&#39;s not like we aren&#39;t used to that.&quot; Jim replied. &quot;But mom and dad could ask why there&#39;s an almost naked kid in the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I forgot about them!&quot; Isaac yelled while he put on an orange dinosaur t-shirt. &quot;What I&#39;m going to tell them? They won&#39;t believe I&#39;m me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have a plan.&quot; Jim said before he threw a pair of tighty whities to him. &quot;Wear these! Your boxers are almost falling off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac stared at the underpants in his hands that he knew his twin brothers use to wet while they sleep. &quot;Shit!&quot; He let it escape from his childish mouth when he remembered that he used to do it too at that age. Has that come back too? He blushed. &quot;Turn around!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim almost bursted into laughter again. Was his big brother ashamed of showing off his dick? The same dick he used to show off in their bedroom? He pretended to obey, but after a brief moment, he turned around again in time to see the puny little dick between Isaac&#39;s skinny legs. It wasn&#39;t longer than an inch!<br />
<br />
Obviously, Jim started laughing and Isaac, ashamed, began to hurry up his change, some tears running down his chubby cheeks. When he was finished, he was wearing a pair of his brothers&#39; shorts and shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, now that you&#39;re dressed, we are going to need some help.&quot; Jim told Isaac while he extended his hand. &quot;Come with me.&quot;</p>
