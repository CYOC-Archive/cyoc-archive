<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I really wish there was a comments section at times so i could get feed back and ideas for this series.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vesper thanked Eva again for the lift as he slid into the waterway near his dorm. At the Mages School there were a multitude of species wanting to learn magic. Of these species there were many that required some kind if special environment. The Aquarius dorm was essentially a private aquarium. The waterways were just a method for students to travel closer to the classes before having to use other methods of reaching class. <br />
After submerging himself in the water and  waiting to see Eva disappear from view, Vesper created another sphere and swam into it. He liked the freedom the sphere offered him, but he loved the feeling of Eva&#39;s massive breasts pressed against him as she carried him when his sphere &quot;broke&quot; or &quot;timed out&quot;, as his excuses he had used at times. Hovering away from the waterway, his human torso exposed to the crisp night air, Vesper didn&#39;t see the shadow decend from the night sky until he  felt the talons grab his arms and lift him out of his transport. The spell ended and a splash of water was the only indicator he had been there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aurora, Really? You know that scares the crap out of me,&quot; fumed Vesper as he looked up at his &quot;kidnapper&quot;.<br />
The harpy spared him a toothy smile as she soared high into the air, &quot;I know Vespy, but I love catching my prey,&quot; she laughed at that and Vesper joined in as he enjoyed the area below him. This was a  view few merfolk could ever see and he loved every minute of it, the feeling of soaring through the sky, the rush of the wind over his body. He always wondered how it felt for Aurora. She had asked him once about how it felt to swim. He had never really thought about it before, it came so naturally and he was so used to it. Was this how humans felt about walking on land or Aurora flying? His thoughts were interrupted as his date set him down at their favorite hideaway. <br />
&quot;Remember when we first found this place,&quot; she asked looking around the forgotten room. The previous owner had renovated the place but had forgotten to tell the current one about the top floor room he had plastered over and thus it had been empty for years. Vesper had found it by accident during a teleportation accident and shared it with his lover. <br />
&quot;I definitely remember our first night here, you got feisty,&quot; said Vesper as he got into a merfolk equivalent of a sitting position.<br />
&quot;You were splashing me, and I&#39;m pretty sure you cast a lust charm on me,&quot; she retorted as she pulled off her Fighters School tunic, seductively looking over her shoulder and dropped it to the floor, showing Her lack of a bra. Her bird talon feet planted close together as she bent down and slowly pulled down her leggings down as well, giving vesper a tease of her wet uncovered sex. As she turned around slowly, Aurora uses her wings to cover her front, like a cloak made of feathers. Moving one taloned hand down to trace her b-cup breasts and the other she brought to her lips and gave him a playful shushing motion as she slowly walked toward him, swaying her hips left and right with each step. Vesper loved it when she did this, and wished he could do something similar for her, but out of water, his options were limited. <br />
Aurora bent down and slowly lowered Vesper to a laying position, kissing each other passionately. Vesper&#39;s member had emerged from the slit it was usually hidden away in and was throbbing at this point. Aurora leaned back up and positioned herself above him. She slowly lowered herself down until she was straddling him and after she felt him enter her, Aurora unfurled her wings as she slid down his shaft, giving Vesper a great view of her body. She began to rock back and forth, letting out soft moans as she did so. Vesper was thankful that the building was empty this time of year as the owner had gone to his winter hunting cabin for the season and began to succumb to the pleasure. Her rocking began to increase in pace as did her panting. <br />
<br />
Aurora loved the feeling of Vesper&#39;s smooth scales on her thighs as she rocked on his member. She liked how his effeminate face contorted in pleasure as he tried to hold on just a little longer. In truth, Aurora felt powerful and in control as she rode him. But what she loved most was what was coming next as she interlocked her hands with his, a signal they had developed together for when one was about to climax and gave the other permission to as well. She absolutely adored the feeling of Vesper&#39;s seed shoot up inside her and fill her insides. Out of curiosity she had him unload into a measuring cup and her jaw dropped as he filled it to just over a 1 and 1/4 cups. <br />
Vesper nodded to her as his hips bucked with her and he finally released after struggling to hold it in for so long and felt her walls clamp down on him as shot after shot entered her. Aurora threw her head back and let the warmth fill her. Her insides expanded slightly to make room and it was euphoric. As harpies were an all female species, they relied on males from other species to impregnate them, but not all could fertilize their eggs, and merfolk were one such race, the perfect birth control that made both parties happy.<br />
<br />
Aurora lat there on top of him panting and waiting for the last part of their routine; where his member would go flaccid and withdraw from her insides and back to Vesper&#39;s slit. She kissed him as he wrapped his arms around her. Usually, she would cover them up with her wings at this point like a feathery blanket, but something was different. Vesper&#39;s dick was not shrinking back down, in fact it had begun to throb and grow even more.<br />
&quot;Ready for round 2 I see,&quot; Aurora sat back up and began to bounce up and down of Vesper&#39;s member. Each bounce seemed to cause him to grow a little more as he went deeper and deeper than before. Soon he felt like a popping feeling below his member and then another load shot up into the horney harpy. He looked down his chest to see how big he was growing and caught a glimpse of a member that was at least 3 times as wide as it originally was. Eyes traveling up Aurora&#39;s body, he saw that his cum was beginning to cause her belly to bulge out slightly. A tightness in his chest brought his eyes back down and widened as his pecs began to inflate slightly along with his now formed 6 pack. <br />
&quot;Aurora, something&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
&quot;No everything is right Ves. My fantasy is coming true, fill me more.&quot; She began to knead his pecs with her hand talons, careful not to cause damage. As if to answer her demand, another popping sensation hit Vesper a little lower than the last, followed by another blast of hot seed. Her vagina was leaking it all over them both as her body ran out of space. &#39;If this is anything like what having eggs grow in me, then I can&#39;t wait for my breeding cycle to begin,&#39; Aurora thought to herself as she played with her lover&#39;s newly grown pecs. <br />
The walls of her vagina tightened on Vesper&#39;s extended member until she reluctantly admitted it was starting to hurt a little and began to pull her inflated body off his member. As she pulled away more and more, Vesper got to finally see his manhood properly. The thing had grown to a hulking 12 inches long. Long enough to nearly reach his pecs. But that is not what caused him to stare,  that was the shape it was forming. A second later his dick split in to two identical shafts side by side, cum dripping down both of them. Aurora saw them and began to slide back down slowly, grabbing one in each hand, she guided them to their destination. When the left one contacted her anus, Aurora slowed her decent. <br />
&quot;Careful, don&#39;t hurt yourself.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. This is going to feel great.&quot;<br />
It did. An explosion of pleasure rocked them both as Vesper felt both shafts through her walls. Feeling his cock rub another was strange, even if the other one was still his. His tail was flopping wildly behind her as she humped him. A stretching sensation began to edge into his mind, and he looked over behind Aurora and saw a shadow move behind her. Vesper shifted his tail experimentally, and the shadow did so too. Eyes widening, he realized it was his tail all the way back there. <br />
&quot;Stop, stop stop.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why? It&#39;s getting fun.&quot;<br />
&quot;Look behind you.&quot;<br />
She turned slightly and her heart stopped for a moment as her natural fight or flight response took over. All harpies were naturally afraid of 3 things; drowning, lightning, and snakes.<br />
As Aurora turned she saw a giant orange and yellow snakelike tail behind her. She suddenly pulled away from Vesper&#39;s twin shafts and grabbed her clothes.<br />
&quot;Wait, Aurora. Don&#39;t goaaagghh!&quot; Vesper&#39;s body suddenly began to writhe in pain as he began to transform. Aurora stood at the door, clothing clutched to her swollen stomach and she saw his pleading eyes. &quot;Please help. It hurts.&quot; She closed her eyes and took to the sky, her fear response overriding all other thought processes. <br />
<br />
Vesper saw his lover abandon him and leave his view before the pain returned again. His tail had begun to stretch longer and thicker, even widening his hips to make room. The tailfin shrunk away as the tail developed a tapered end like a snake, yellow scales forming the underside, pushing the orange scales to cover the rest. Black scales grew in to add a spotted pattern to him. His hands began to sting as his fingertips grew into claws. A pain in his back caused Vesper to roll over onto his stomach as something pushed out. Tears streamed down his face as his canines sharpened and hollowed out as venom glands formed and his toung lengthened as the tip split into a fork. A pair of black horns forced themselves out of his skull and curved backwards. A large dorsal fin pushed out of his back and trailed down his tail. Eventually, the transformation ceased and all the pain left him. He wrapped himself up with his now 25 foot long tail into a kind of fetal position and balled his eyes out as he repeated over and over; &quot;she ran, she ran.&quot;</p>
