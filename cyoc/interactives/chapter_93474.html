<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas let out a sigh of disappointent, a piece of paper hanging loosely in his grip. &quot;Maaan... It&#39;s not my fault that I don&#39;t know shit about Egypt or whatever...&quot; He said with a groan, crouching down soon after. Luckily, it was only him and his sister nearby, as the were wandering on a path in the forest next to their neighborhood.<br />
Thomas himself was pretty tall and lanky for a 17 year old, with shoulder-length, black hair that was nothing but a mess most of the time. His green eyes had some faint bags under them, and his skin was pale. He, of course, wore the school uniform; a white shirt with black trousers.<br />
At the age of 15, his sister was on the petite side. She had equally black, long hair, as soft as silk and the same, green eyes. Her body was nothing to be all that proud off... Small chest, and her hips were nothing interesting, either. She also wore a white shirt, along with a bright red skirt and white tights.<br />
&quot;You know... Just saying that out loud won&#39;t really help...&quot; Martha, his younger sister, pointed out from next to him. After a couple of seconds, she chuckled. &quot;...But, to be honest, the results came as no surprise. Instead of studying you just played video games and watched those cartoons all-&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ANIME! Not cartoons!&quot; He interupted her, jumping up onto his feet.<br />
&quot;Right, right...&quot; She waved her hand in front of him. &quot;...Aaanyway, if you&#39;re just gonna mope about here, I&#39;ll be on my way.&quot; And with that, she continued to walk, leaving him behind.<br />
&quot;...Why couldn&#39;t I have been an only child...?&quot; He groaned, starting to slowly waddle after her.<br />
<br />
(A couple of hours later...)<br />
<br />
&quot;...And that is why Terraria is better than Minecraft!&quot; Thomas proudly announced over the Skype conversation to his friends.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so full of shit, you know that?&quot; Frank asked bluntly.<br />
&quot;I dunno... I&#39;d say they&#39;re both crap.&quot; Benjamin commented, followed by him and Frank getting head-shot. &quot;Dammit! Who was that?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh... Nobody~.&quot; Henry said teasingly, whistling afterwards.<br />
&quot;Riiight...&quot; As soon as he respawned, Frank quickly made his way over to Henry. Benjamin seemed to have the same idea.<br />
&quot;Hey, big brother! Dinner&#39;s ready!&quot; Thomas nearly jumped at the sound of his sister shouting. He paused the game and sighed.<br />
&quot;BRB...&quot; He muttered before muting the Skype call.<br />
<br />
(Meanwhile...)<br />
<br />
Chris yawned, rubbing her eyes. It had been difficult, by she knew that this time... this time, her connection would not fail her! She found a nice, not overly crowded server, clicked on it, and waited... She begged for it to finally work!<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; She shouted cheerfully, she had finally gotten on a server! ...And was greeted by messages coming up about some guy being killed over and over again... THere were also a few welcomes to her mixed in, too.<br />
She just played on it for a few hours, getting to know the other players a bit... Though they stayed prettty anonymous ...besides this guy called Henry. From what she understood, they were all a group of friends, and one of them had gone to eat, and they decided to kill him a bunch of times for no reason...<br />
<br />
(Next day...)<br />
<br />
Chris sat in her classroom, nearly half asleep... She had stayed up for way too long last night...<br />
Her light purple hair covered half of her face, and hung almost down to her rump, and covered one of her blue eyes. She was one of the tallest girls of her class, and her figure was nothing bad, either. With full C cup breasts and a soft, big rump. Despite her pretty decent body, Chris didn&#39;t like the attention it got in the slightest.<br />
&quot;Helloo~? Anybody there?&quot; Chris quickly opened her eyes, nearly jumping out of her seat. A hand was waving about in front of her! &quot;...Well, now there is!&quot;<br />
Looking up, she saw that the person was Bianca, some girl from her class. She pulled up a chair and sat down next to Chris.<br />
&quot;Sooo... How&#39;s it going? You&#39;re always so quiet and stuff.&quot; She placed her elbows on thedesk and rested her head in her palms with her head tilted ever so slightly with a questioning look on her face.<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m fine...&quot; Chris answered quietly. &quot;...I, uh... I just got nothing to talk about, I guess...&quot; She said as an excuse. Almost as if to save her, she felt her phone vibrate, singaling that she had gotten a message...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello. Do you like video games?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all the message said. She couldn&#39;t even find out who had sent it... Though slightly confused, she answered with a simple yes.<br />
&quot;Hey, did something come up?&quot; Bainca leaned over to glance at Chris&#39; phone. Both girls were suddently blinded at the strong light, along with several other students that stood close to them...<br />
<br />
Something similar happened to Thomas, too... He had been hanging around with his buddies at school, but was interrupted by a message. After having answered the same question, him and his friends were also caught by the light.<br />
Even his sister got the message, and even when denying it, she and her friends had the same happen to them.<br />
<br />
When they awoke, they quickly find they they are NOT at their school...</p>
