<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle, Eric and Hank started to walk out of the store and toward Kyle’s car. Getting in the car and heading for the exit, Kyle could not help being distracted because Eric had put on the jacket as they’re crossing the parking lot. <br />
	<br />
Kyle tried a few times to bring up the subject in an indirect manner, but as the car was guided to the curb, Kyle said, “Hey, Hank. Why don’t you head inside.”<br />
	<br />
“Okay.” Hank gathered up the bags that had his new clothes and exited the vehicle.<br />
	<br />
Before Eric could open his door, Kyle cleared his throat, grabbing Eric’s attention. “Something wrong Kyle?” Eric asked turning to face his friend.<br />
	<br />
“More a question. Why are still wearing the jacket? I thought agreed to not wear it anymore.”<br />
	<br />
“Oh. Well I did say I wanted to wear it a little more. I was planning to stop when we got and give you the jacket.”<br />
	<br />
“Really. Why give it to me?”<br />
	<br />
“Simple. I don’t want my brother getting his hands on it again. You having the jacket makes sure of that, and tomorrow you can bring it to school and we will decide what to do with it then.”<br />
	<br />
Kyle nodded along as Eric spoke. “Good idea. Want help getting your bags inside?”<br />
	<br />
Getting out of the car, Eric pulled the jacket off and threw it in the backseat of Kyle vehicle. “Nah. I got it. See you tomorrow at school?”<br />
	<br />
“You know it. Oh, and make sure to find me before school. I want to introduce you to the Coach Ryans.”<br />
	<br />
“The football coach?”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah. You said you wanted to be a lineman for the team. Well, I think Coach will make an exception for you and let you join.”<br />
	<br />
“Oh. That’s great. See you tomorrow then.” Eric said as Kyle was turning of his car and driving away.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Eric walked into the house and carried his new clothes up to his room. After dropping the garments on the floor. Eric headed to the bathroom while pulling off his shirt. Turning on the lights and closing the door, Eric turned to look at himself in the mirror.<br />
	<br />
The first thing that Eric noticed was the peach fuzz he had seen on hi face earlier had not grown into a short but thick beard. It even reach down his neck, almost connecting with the generous amount of hair Eric now found on his chest. His stomach and pectorals were now covered in a forest of hair, hiding a fair bit of skin. Taking his pants off, Eric found that the amount of body hair had also increased across most of the rest of his body. He now had furry arms and legs, with follicles found growing on his toes and the back of his hands.<br />
	<br />
Eric was thrilled at the idea of having a beard in high school, but set those thoughts aside and took a look at the size of his muscles. The only way you could describe Eric now was very burly. His shoulders and widened and his biceps looked to be close over twenty inches around. Though his body had a generous level of fat now, Eric could only enjoy his new physique. He had specifically purchased clothes a size larger so they would not rip after his had wore the jacket for another little bit.<br />
	<br />
Though he now had a small belly, Eric could still see his boxers. Pulling them down, Eric finally saw the reason for all of body hair. While his cock was about seven inches, it was the size of his balls that widened Eric’s eye. They were huge now, about the size of two small oranges, held in a very low hanging sack, and his testicles caused his penis to almost instantly swell. <br />
	<br />
Grabbing his cock, Eric started to bump his with his right hand. He reveled in his new larger muscles, and as he ran his figures though his body hair, Eric exploded on to the mirror and across the sink with a guttural moan. Seeing the amount of semen Eric had coated his bathroom in, he could not help but smirk thinking of all of the girl and twink holes he was now planning to fill with his juices.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
The next day, Eric came down the stairs to a table almost buckling under the weight of all the food placed on it. Eric was confused at first, but with a very loud rubble coming form his belly, he quickly sat and started in on the proffered food. Starting out with something simple and light, Eric rapidly added more food to his plate when he realized how hungry he was.<br />
	<br />
Bacon, eggs, pancakes, sausage, milk, juice. These were swiftly placed before him and the food was just as swiftly consumed. It took Eric almost thirty minutes to finish, plush amount was equal to what he would have consumed over three before wearing the jacket. Letting out a loud belch, Eric sat back in his chair rubbing his stomach.<br />
	<br />
“Get enough to eat?” Eric heard in a comical tone.<br />
	<br />
Looking up, Eric saw that his brother was sitting across the table from him. Eric had been so involved with eat, he had not even realized Hank had come in the kitchen. Continuing to rub his belly, Eric replied with a smirk, “Yep. Now I feel like I’m ready to join the football team.”<br />
	<br />
“What about your beard? Aren’t you going to shave it?”<br />
	<br />
Running his hands with his facial hair, “No. I trimmed it down and got it off my neck. I think that is enough.” Grabbing his things, Eric head out. <br />
	<br />
Arriving at school, Eric searched for and quickly found Kyle. Kyle was waiting near the football field watching the JV team practice. “Aren’t you suppose to be out there practicing?” Eric asked coming to stand beside his friend.<br />
	<br />
“Nope. Apparently I’m on the varsity as the second string quarterback. I would be first string according to some of the guys, but I don’t have enough experience.”<br />
	<br />
“Wow. I guess I never thought about how the world would change after wearing the jacket. I guess you’re really pumped for when the varsity practices?”<br />
	<br />
With a giant smile spreading across his a shaven face that would be stubbly in just a few hours, and maybe even a short beard by the end of the day, “You have not idea how pumped I am. And the best part is the fact we will be in the weight room today. I get to really put this body through the wringer.” Turning to look at Eric, “Ready to meet the coach and join the team?”<br />
	<br />
“You know it, but just wondering.”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah, what?”<br />
	<br />
“Am I going to be on the JV or varsity team?”<br />
	<br />
“I heard this morning that Frank Farro was going to be moving to a new town this month. You know his dad is in the army, right?”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah sure.”<br />
	<br />
“Well that leave one of the second string lineman spots open. Specifically the spot for a center on the offensive line.”<br />
	<br />
After taking Eric to the football coach and getting him signed up for the team. Kyle made sure that Eric knew how to put on his pads and then run him through a few exercises. Kyle had made sure that both of them had purchased all the thinks that they would need on the team, but in much larger sizes to accommodate their larger bodies. <br />
	<br />
Kyle was pleasantly surprised when Eric seemed to do all of the practice routines without much training. Sense Eric had never played football before, they chalked up his ease with everything from coming to see Kyle at practice, but in the back of their minds, the were sure that this was a unforeseen side effect of wearing the jacket while picturing himself as a lineman.<br />
	<br />
After grabbing some quick showers, both boys separated, heading to their first classes of the day. Kyle was carrying the jacket in his hand and was passing by the library. Just happening to look inside as he walked, Kyle saw a freshman nerd handing homework over to a group of guys from a few of the different sports teams. The head of the group was Neil Rust. The halfback on the JV team. Kyle had never liked the guy and could not resist walking up behind the asshole. “Hey guys. How are you all doing this morning?”<br />
	<br />
Surprised that someone on the varsity football team was there, Neil only stammered for a moment. “Uh, Uh. Nothing. I was just here with some of my friends studying.”<br />
	<br />
“Really.” Kyle feigned surprise. “I thought the JV team was practicing this morning. Did the coach let you out a little early?”<br />
	<br />
Taking the easy exit, “Yeah. He did.”<br />
	<br />
&quot;Well, that was nice, but why don’t all of you head to class. You all want to keep up your grades to stay on the teams.” Leaning over a little bit, Kyle used his new height to intimidate the young jocks.<br />
	<br />
After Kyle watched the group head out of the library, he turned on the freshman nerd cowering between two of the bookcases. “What’s your name buddy?”<br />
	<br />
“Justin.” He answered in a trembling voice.<br />
	<br />
“Well, it’s nice to meet you, Justin. Ever thought about going out for one of the sports teams?” Seeing the incredulousness on the guys face, “I’m not joking. I’m just saying that if you join one and get a little meat on your bones, guys like that will bother your less.” Kyle, smiling, asked, “If you could be on a sports team, which one would it be?”<br />
	<br />
Seeing that he would not be going anywhere until Justin satisfied this giant before him, “Well. Um. I always … wanted to wanted try out lacrosse.”<br />
	<br />
“Wow. That’s cool.” Then getting an idea, Kyle pulled out the jacket. “You know, you really look cold, buddy. Here, you can borrow my jacket.”<br />
	<br />
“Are you sure?” Justin asked with surprised written across his face.<br />
	<br />
“Yeah. I’m heading to Mr. Franklin’s class and he really keeps the room warm. So I don’t really need it for today. Hell, with PE as my second period and practice after school, why don’t you keep it for the day. You can return it tomorrow.”<br />
	<br />
“Really. Thanks. I’ll make sure you have it back tomorrow morning. I’ll be here in the library.”<br />
	<br />
Smiling at the enthusiasm, Kyle said, “My name is Kyle.” Then turning, “ I guess I’ll see you tomorrow.” Leaving the library, Kyle couldn’t help but that a quick look back at Justin as he left, enjoying the sight at seeing the kid examining the jacket with joy on his face.</p>
