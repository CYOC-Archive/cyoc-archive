<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was standing, the weight of her body was immense. Now to get to the toilet first and get dressed second.  She tried lifting her foot to take a step as she&#39;d always done, but to her despair, she barely felt the foot lift from the ground before it was pushed down again. She tried again, she got a little further before it was forced down again, sending ripples through her fat body.<br />
She was accutely aware of Martha just standing there waiting, it really got on her nerves to have an audience like this. <br />
Kyle said she&#39;d be mobile, but how exactly did he say it? She thought back to his words and groaned. He said waddle didn&#39;t he? She remembered laughing at videos of fat people ponderously waddling through their homes. This couldn&#39;t be happening!<br />
She desperately tried to take another normal step, with the same result.<br />
She was starting to feel the pressure on her knees, she needed to get a move on. She sighed deeply, thinking back to how the ugle fat people had moved around.<br />
She shifted her weight to one side. Her gut and massive zzz breasts slid over her body, as she tried to lift her foot. She had ground clearance this time. She shifted her weight forward and managed a small step. Her body jiggled wildly as her foot touched the ground.<br />
She shifted her weight to the other side. Her gut and massive zzz breasts slid over her body to the other side and took another step. Her massive blubbery butt and hips shook wildly as she slowly waddled to the door. Worse still, as she waddled she could feel her thighs rub her fat pussy. It felt good.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily from the exertion, she looked at the door. It seemed wider than she remembered it being. Considering her new sextoys, the world had obviously changed to suit her new form. She looked anxiously at her massive hips. He&#39;d said she always got stuck in doors, so why did it look bigger?<br />
&quot;Do you need a hand miss?&quot; Martha&#39;s dull tones asked. Did she sound impatient?<br />
&quot;Let me try.&quot; <br />
She shifted her weight again and waddled into the door. She immediately felt the doorframe brush part of her hips. She took another waddle and the other side of the doorframe dug into her fat. <br />
Another small waddle and Jennifer found she was stuck. She couldn&#39;t shift her weight enough in the  narrow doorframe. It&#39;d been made just big enough for her to get stuck. She grabbed the doorframe with her fat sausage fingers and pulled as she tried to get through. The doorframe dug deeper into her fat, but she didn&#39;t make much progress.<br />
<br />
Jennifer jumped when she suddenly felt two cold hands push against her fat dimply ass. She looked around to Martha giving her a push.<br />
&quot;Come on miss, let&#39;s get you through.&quot;<br />
Could this day get any worse? She pulled at the doorframe with Martha pushing and slowly, almost in a magical way she slid through the door. With a loud plop she plopped free. Her fat and tits shook and danced around her, nearly knocking her off balance.<br />
&quot;Damn, finally.&quot; She was raging inside.<br />
She then noticed the bathroom door. &quot;FUCK!&quot;<br />
<br />
She ponderously waddled to the bathroom door and once again Martha helped push her through. Jiggling wildly she surveyed their bathroom. It was a good thing her parents had money for a large house and a large bathroom. She had dreaded the toilet, worried that her massive ass could even fit on the toilet seat.  To her relief though, the toilet had been adapted to her new form. Longer piping allowed the toilet to be further from the wall.<br />
<br />
She slowly lowered herself and felt her ass and hips cascade over the toilet seat. Her gut and heavy tits rested on her massive lap. The feeling of disgust at herself was quickly replaced by the relief of finally emptying her bladder and not having to carry that weight. To get up, several support grips were added to the walls near her. She grabbed two of them and shifter her weight forward. Her massive tits slid of her hanging gut and landed on the tiled floor. With great effort she managed to get off the toilet. <br />
<br />
Slowly, and with Martha&#39;s help, she waddled back to her room. Her cunt was aching for attention from the massage it was receiving from her thighs.<br />
She opened her walk-in-closet and groaned at all the clothes she had. Kids could play in them and worse, there was another door separating her from the clothes. Martha however walked in without a problem and quickly returned with a bra and panties. She didn&#39;t dear look at the size of her new bra. With Martha&#39;s help she pulled up the panties, her legfat shifted and jiggled as she pulled it up. It was a tight fit.<br />
<br />
Martha walked back in and came back with one set of clothes. A tight top and sweatpants. She needed something that would hide some of her roles and that last items weren&#39;t it. They would show off every dimple, every roll she had.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t there anything else in there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry miss, everything else is in the laundry or in tatters.&quot; Did she spot Martha smirk?<br />
&quot;You mean I have an entire closet and everything is gone? Are you pulling my leg?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I could do that miss.&quot; Yes, she was smirking. That bitch was trying to set her up with terrible clothes.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take a look myself, help me get in.&quot; Jennifer commanded.<br />
&quot;Sorry miss, but I&#39;m in  a hurry and it&#39;s my day off. I don&#39;t have time to spend another hour here. It&#39;s either this or nothing.&quot;<br />
Jennifer was seething. That bitch, but if she refused she was stuck here in her underwear. She was so getting fired for this. She would personally kick that boring old hag out.<br />
Martha meanwhile stood there, just as boring as ever and held out the clothes. <br />
&quot;Fine!&quot; Jennifer relented, she needed to get out and get that limp dicked Kyle.<br />
<br />
She was able to struggle her top on by her self, flesh jiggling as she struggled. With Martha&#39;s help they managed to struggle into the tight sweatpants. <br />
She looked in the mirror. They were every bit as unflattering as Jennifer had feared. Every roll, every dimple was visible. Her massive cleavage hung low on her fat belly and stretched the fabric. Even through the bra you could easily spot her large nipples push into it.<br />
Her pants meanwhile just made her ass look even bigger and did nothing to hide her rolls.<br />
If she wasn&#39;t going to be able to kick Martha out, she was going to step on her toes. But Kyle and the curse were her first concern. She needed to get thin and get back at him.<br />
She was feeling a bit peckish though.</p>
