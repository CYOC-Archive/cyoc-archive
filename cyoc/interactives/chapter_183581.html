<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been about a month since she had been attacked by that strange wolf in the woods. Amy was a young woman who had been studying medicine. She was on the verge of finishing medical school, but lately she hadn&#39;t been feeling well for some reason. She felt hot, and even itchy, making it hard for her to wear clothing comfortably. What just made it stranger was that her dog had been acting weird around her in the last few days, trying to shove his muzzle between her legs and lick. That didn&#39;t help her with her last problem, that she felt increasingly aroused and horny, but she had no way of alleviating that one since she lived alone and was single.<br />
<br />
Right now she was laying on her bed naked with a sheet pulled over her body. She was on the phone with one of her professors who she hoped would be able to help her. She had just finished explaining her symptoms to her. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound like anything I&#39;ve ever heard of before,&quot; her professor, Dr. Maria Gutierrez answered with a sigh. &quot;You sent in some blood work to the lab, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but they said that it would be a while before I got an answer,&quot; Amy answered as she tried not to rub herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did this start? A month ago when you got attacked by that wolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it only started about a week ago,&quot; Amy said as she brushed her hair back. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that you&#39;re not the only one to have similar symptoms,&quot; Maria answered with a sigh. &quot;I believe that its just some weird new flu going around or something honestly. Just be careful, okay? I&#39;ve heard that some people have been acting weird as a result of it, but that&#39;s just a rumor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, thank you Professor,&quot; Amy answered as she adjusted herself a little. She couldn&#39;t help but feel hornier from the feeling of the silky sheets against her naked body, rubbing against her pussy and nipples, but she tried to resist a moan. &quot;Is there anything you can do to help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go and see if I can get your bloodwork sped up, or at least see if I can get some similar results from other bloodwork,&quot; Maria answered. &quot;I know it&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s about all I can do at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, thank you Professor, I&#39;ll talk to you later,&quot; Amy said as she hung up and pulled off her sheets again. She could no longer hold herself back as she reached over and grabbed a large dildo off the table next to her and tried to shove it into her pussy, but it felt inadequate.<br />
<br />
Her brain was screaming at her that some fake cock wasn&#39;t going to do the job. She needed the real thing as the itch and heat just grew more. She looked down at herself to see that her pubic hair had started growing out, consuming her skin as it spread down her legs and up her torso. It wasn&#39;t making any sense to her, but she could no longer resist, she needed to be fucked and she needed it now. But she couldn&#39;t think of any males around that could do it.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she heard the scratching at the door. She stumbled forward, feeling something at the base of her spine as she reached the door and managed to pull it open, letting her dog come bounding in. He already wasn&#39;t a small dog, being a German Shephard, but he was growing much larger, starting to get onto his hind legs. She saw that his red cock was already out of its sheath as she fell onto all fours, her fingers growing claws as they started to dig into the carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breed... bitch...&quot; She managed to grunt out as her teeth became sharper and her mouth started to push out into a muzzle. Her brain was screaming that this was wrong, but she didn&#39;t care, she was slowly losing herself to her new more animalistic instincts as she tried to entice the male into breeding her like the bitch she was becoming. &quot;Maaaate!&quot;<br />
<br />
The changing Dog didn&#39;t need much more prompting than that. He was confused by why this bitch looked and smelled so much like his mistress, but his instincts were telling him to mount her, to breed her with his pups. Her tail was already forming and presenting her pussy to him. He whimpered for a moment before he finally mounted Amy and thrust his throbbing red cock between her dripping lips, causing her to yelp in surprise.<br />
<br />
As they began to rut with one another, their transformations sped up. Amy&#39;s tongue lulled out as her ears migrated to the top of her head and turned to points as her muzzle fully formed. Her hands and feet had become more like paws as her claws fully grew out. She started to move with each thrust, her breasts bouncing a bit as new nipples grew along her underside. She was lite, and somewhat muscular now, but not too much with her hips now perfect for child bearing. There was nothing left of the woman she once was both physically and mentally now, she was nothing more than a Werewolf breeding bitch.<br />
<br />
The male on the other hand had grown into a large, muscular wolf. He rutted his new bitch as he threw his head back and howled. She was tight as he thrust into her harder and faster, his knot stretching her tight walls with each thrust. She felt so good, and he wanted to do nothing more than get her pregnant with his pups. She let out a howl as he finally locked them together, biting her shoulder as he did. The two beasts were completely consumed by their lust.<br />
<br />
The two wolves finally let out a long howl as the male finally came into his bitch. Once he was finally able to pull out of her, he sniffed her, while her scent was somewhat familiar, her scent was now fully canine. She licked his muzzle, having enjoyed the round of mating that had helped quench her heat.<br />
<br />
The two sniffed the air, they could smell more of their kind not far away. But they could also smell humans. The male could smell bitches just waiting to be bred and rutted as he got up onto his hind legs, his cock sliding back into its sheath as he gave his first bitch a nod. It was time to hunt.</p>
