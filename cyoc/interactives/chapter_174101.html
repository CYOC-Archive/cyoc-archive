<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You, your Boyfriend/unofficial fiancee, and Amanda went back to your appartment. Amanda had convinced you to sit in the back seat with her so she could pet you some more. You both were quickly becomming friends, although you still felt like you knew her from somewhere already, but just couldn&#39;t seem to remember from where or when. However you enjoyed her petting skills enough to accept her as a close friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Titties, I am curious and you don&#39;t have to answer but, why don&#39;t you cover your boobs?&quot; <br />
<br />
You explained to her how your body is naturally extremely sensitive in certain areas, like your breasts and ears. Where that those area can be so sensitive to touch thatany direct contact with a solid object could cause you to become paralyzed, or even nearly pass out from with pleasure. There was just something about Amanda that made you feel very at ease around her. Enough to even start sharing intimate details about yourself, such as how your libido often is super difficult to manage and how she almost sent you down a spiral of endlessly building lust when she touched your ears.<br />
<br />
She particularly was interested in your excessive lactation issue, and even asked <br />
if she could taste a bit of it, which to even your surprise, your boyfriend found himself ok with allowing. You were more than willing too for some reason. It was like you just couldn&#39;t deny Amanda. <br />
<br />
The 3 of you entered your appartment and made yourselves comfortable. Specifically you stripped everything except for your heels, but you did swap out the ballet heels for a strappy pair of stilettos. Interestingly, Amanda didn&#39;t seem phased by seeing your naked body in the slightest. In fact she didn&#39;t even bat an eye when you walked out of your room on all fours,  much to your disappointment. It was as if nothing phased her. &quot;Oh come on does nothing about this come across you as being odd?&quot; You complained. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is very different, but nothing I am surprised in the slightest by.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pout at her reply, finding her mental defense against surprises and oddities to be annoyingly resilient. Seeing you pout caused her to let out a sigh. &quot;Well, I guess now is as good a time as ever.&quot; You watch in shock as Amanda begins to float up off of the chair. Suddenly her clothing alters into a loose fitting white cloth and robe which was decoratively draped across her body. White wings spread out from her hips and a star shaped halo-esque head piece appeared above her head. Even her dirty blonde hair lightened significantly turning a light yellow almost beige color. Finally everything seemed to settle down and before you the new looking amanda was floating looking a bit bored. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as you can see I am not human, just  like you aren&#39;t anymore, my new best friend&quot; said Amanda with a wink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, it was you who sent us the questionnaires?&quot; You said in shock at the sudden revelation. Amanda smiled &quot;guilty as charged.&quot; Hearing that you rushed over and jumped up to her and pulled her down into a hug. &quot;Thank you. Thank you so much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok! Your welcome, YOUR WELCOME. Now get off of me already.&quot; You hop off of her while offering her a hand. &quot;Sorry, I was just so excited to finally meet you is all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but did you have to lick my face?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Did I do that? Sorry. Sometimes the fox part of me acts up all on its own. And I believe it gets influenced according to my current emotional state.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It 100% does. I should know as I&#39;m the one who made it work like that. I know more about you than maybe even you yourself. And I am very happy that you are so happy with your current life, given that this all was the result of a misunderstanding with an ink smudge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you like, an Angel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck no. Thosd guys are just copying me. This is my look, they saw it and took it for themselves. And no, I am not a goddess either, although that may be the easiest thing to relate my existence to you as. Basically I am a sentient magic cluster which formed an ego and created the persona: Amanda. Oh, and before you try anything, I have existed for such a long time that nothing surprises me anymore, so please don&#39;t waste your time. I have no wish to make a game out of it. I greatly implore you to reconsider the thought you just had.&quot;<br />
<br />
You folded your arms in disappointment. &quot;Fine, I won&#39;t since you are asking me so adamantly about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda breathed a sigh of relief after hearing that. &quot;Thank you. Anyways, I am sure you have questions. But let me explain just a few things first.<br />
<br />
1) I have choosen you to be my contractor for the remainder of your life. In other words, we are going to be quite literal BFFLs. Also, that means that you have access to use some of my magic, or have me use it for you if you can&#39;t manage it. Also, I am really sorry for it, but this is why you find it so hard to deny me, find me so familiar, even though we haven&#39;t ever met, and accept me as being trustworthy while also feeling at ease around me, even though I have yet to really do anything in support of these.<br />
<br />
2) I love you, I hope we can have a very close relationship, and I don&#39;t mind sharing you with Boyfriend #1 whose currently masturbating to the thoughts of you in sexy positions and outfits, sone of which now include me as being your lesbian girlfriend, while in the shower. Some of his sinarios are honestly kinda hot in my opinion. Perhapse we could make them a reality sometime? Anyways last point.<br />
<br />
3) This current form you are in is now hard set as your vanilla, default form. From now on, you are recognized as being this foxgirl. There is nothing I can do to change that anymore. So I can only add things to it. Or remove them, but only temporarily for a short while. Unfortunately that also means your name is locked in as Titties Loves-cum too, until you eventually get married to loverboy in the showers that is. But that isn&#39;t set to happen for some time still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I really am going to marry him!&quot; You ask excitedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, but not just him, you will be married to 3 people, at minimum. I am the first wife too, and I won&#39;t spoil too much about your second wife just yet, only that you haven&#39;t yet met her, and she is going to have a big influence on your life. Oh, and you will eventually, permanently have 4 breasts at minimum. Ok enough of these future spoilers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so what now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Amanda says nonchalantly. &quot;Wanna fuck?&quot;</p>
