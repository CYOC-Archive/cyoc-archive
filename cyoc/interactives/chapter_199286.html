<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wellspring. WELLspring. WellSPRING.&quot;<br />
<br />
You practised the intonations of your new secret identity, pacing the room in your new body as it reformed around you. The walls were closing in, while a window stretched larger, opening up the space for more natural light. Trinkets disappeared as your new room was quite bare, only furnished with bare necessities and colored a clean, universal white just like you.<br />
<br />
Your mind bubbled up with information as your old life was wiped away with you being none the wiser. The old you seemed so distant now, an inconsequential memory to be forgotten. You remembered your childhood, a time of happiness with two loving parents. You remembered growing  up a regular girl, going through school, getting bullied for your albinism but never losing heart. You remembered the catastrophe, your family home being torn apart by a hurricane, your parents crushed under the debris as you felt their warmth fading as you cried, holding onto their hands, your powers manifesting only minutes later as a cruel twist of fate. You remembered going on a journey, leaving right after the funeral and taking your meager inheritance with you to the world on a quest of self-discovery. You remember the years in monasteries, in temples, traveling the great outdoors, helping the lucky few along the way who had the fortune to meet you on their darkest hour. And you remember arriving here, into your new home, as a mature woman 21 years of age, finally ready settle down and use your gift for the greater good.<br />
<br />
You gasped as you emerged from the trance of rememberance, suddenly pulled back to the moment after having lived years of a new life. Years as...<br />
<br />
&quot;Vera.&quot; You whispered.<br />
&quot;I am Vera Avan. And now Wellspring.&quot;<br />
<br />
It all came back to you. Your new mission. You were going to help people. Be a superhero. And that began with a secret identity. Luckily you had it all figured out.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The receptionist wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do with the young woman who had arrived at the hospital, politely waiting for her turn before announcing that she was there to accept the job as a nurse. There were no job interviews scheduled for today. But he guided her to the supervisor&#39;s office nonetheless, her serene face hard to say no to. And once there, he was rewarded with a heavenly smile. Totally worth it.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, I frankly have no idea what you mean. You cannot just barge in here to demand a job. Usually regular people book a time. And you don&#39;t even have the training? How are you going to become a nurse if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Steele was not having a good day. In her fourty long years of working as a hospital supervisor at St. Serena&#39;s, she&#39;d never once encountered someone like Vera. There she sat, in front of her, smiling along without a care in the world after having just announced that she&#39;s there to become a nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Mrs. Steele. Can I call you Agatha? I am quite sure I would become an excellent nurse. I&#39;ve volunteered at medical camps in developing countries, and am fully trained in the natural healing arts of the Fung Yo monks. If you&#39;d just give me the chance to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poppycock!&quot; You didn&#39;t have time to finish your sentence before the elderly lady banged her desk, her face growing redder by the second. Her wrinkled face had twisted into a mask of rage, veins popping on her forehead, her breath wheezing as she struggled to collect herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a hospital, not a circus! If you think for even a SECOND I&#39;ll let you come in here to practise your &quot;expertise,&quot; you&#39;d best be making your way out right N-&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused as you lunged forward, covering her balled up fist with you slender digits.<br />
<br />
Agatha Steele was beyond outraged by this unwarranted physical contact, her breath huffing and puffing and her heart hammering in her chest. She was fully prepared to throw this young upstart out of here, even if it would kill her.<br />
<br />
Those thoughts faded when your power kicked in.<br />
<br />
It was as if a nuclear explosion had went off inside Mrs. Steele, her body lighting up from an inner glow as you pushed your restorative energy into her. You smiled as she quieted down immediately. The old lady clearly just needed a little pick-me-up. Something you were more than happy to provide.<br />
<br />
Agatha couldn&#39;t believe what was happening. She was feeling better than in years, a feeling that was increasing by the second. Her hammering heart was calming down, breathing became easier and her temper toned down. The indescribable feeling coursed through her entire body as her sputtering biological clock began to slow down, eventually grinding to a halt, before amazingly beginning to tick backwards repairing itself from the point of breaking down into a new golden age.<br />
<br />
Her back cracked loudly as her vertebrae popped, a hunch gained from years of sitting down on a desk job erased in seconds, the simple fix in posture skyrocketing her height. Her heart began hammering with renewed vigor, pumping thicker and enriched blood through her youthening body. Frail old bones were infused with calcium, creaking connections reinforced with brand new ligaments and muscle fibers stretching and strengthening, drastically increasing her body&#39;s range of motion. An ability she would be happy about only seconds later as she slipped on her chair, the change overwhelming her as she fell to the ground, legs stretching into a perfect split. Though your hands were no longer touching, she couldn&#39;t escape your restorative influence as her aged body continued to convulse on the floor.<br />
<br />
Her groin impacting the floor had the unforeseen effect of kickstarting her feminine facilities. A moistening tunnel flared to life as Mrs. Steele was pulled back from beyond the menopause, her womb and ovaries burning up as they restarted production, flooding her body with hormones that only accelerated her restoration.<br />
<br />
You smiled as the overseer convulsed on the ground, her crow&#39;s feet being erased as her pores began to secrete natural oils that rapidly restored her skin to a glorious luster, smoothening, pulling back the wrinkles and even darkening into a delicious darkness as if your power was a sun tanning her from within. Carefully, you made your way behind the desk, making sure not to hit her as she convulsed on the floor, and grabbed her by the shoulder, pushing more power into the morphing woman.<br />
<br />
It was too much. Mrs. Steele&#39;s will broke, and she moaned, loudly, from the hormones and healing power overcharging her. Like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, the face of her youth pushed through the mask of a bitter old woman. Her teeth straightened and whitened, brand new ones growing in to replace their missing sisters. Her cheekbones grew more defined as wrinkled skin was smoothed over, creating a model-esque visage crowned by two bright green eyes, widening as their vision was fully restored. Her nose shortened, her ears flattened and her hair drank deep from the well of power as deep, dark midnight black locks burst from her scalp, growing to a smooth bowl cut that framed her head perfectly. Inside her brain, she could feel years of bitterness and disappointments fading away, and she remembered why she had taken this job, years ago: To help people. To keep this wonderful establishment running. <br />
<br />
Lost love, now found once more, burst forth from her heart as she smiled for the first time in decades, bringing with it her full blossoming. Her muscles bunched up and grew, turning the healthy overseer into a toned beauty without sacrificing her feminine grace. As you slowly helped her upright, her posterior bounced with new muscles and fat, becoming a full, bouncy globe that perfectly complemented her wide hips. And on her chest, her saggy old tits grew larger and firmer, regaining the proud and hefty size of her youth, bouncing high on her restored form. She let out a sudden gasp as she felt wetness at her nipples, and the giggled in her soft, smoky voice as she noticed the wet stains on her blouse and realized her breasts had let loose a burst of milk, a memento from the children she had birthed.<br />
Yes, children... she absent-mindedly pressed a hand on her stomach, feeling her restored fertility. She blushed at the thought, giddy as a schoolgirl.<br />
<br />
You admired your handiwork. Where once was a senile, wheezing ball of spite, now stood a gorgeous and commanding woman in her early twenties, full of poise and energy, bounding with limitless drive and potential. She smiled at you, and you smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Miss Avan. I&#39;m delighted to welcome you into our amazing staff. You&#39;ll start tomorrow.<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Steele. I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t regret this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agatha grinned and examined her new body as her newest employee, as well as friend, turned to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t,&quot; she muttered to herself.</p>
