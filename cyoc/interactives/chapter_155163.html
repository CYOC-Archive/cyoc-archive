<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul&#39;s fate was perhaps a bit kinder than Chad&#39;s might have been, all things considered. Vanessa used many of the same methods that she and Paul both had used on Chad, to keep Paul compliant: limiting his contact with the outside word, controlling his access to food, and so forth. Vanessa thought that it was particularly important to limit his access to sex—it only served him right for what he did to Chad—so she didn&#39;t give him the golden sea-serpent bracelet at all, and she also didn&#39;t use him in that fashion to sate her own desires for many weeks.<br />
<br />
She was a witch a with a merman fetish. She wouldn&#39;t just succumb to base desires right away; she&#39;d do things *her* way.<br />
<br />
After a month and more had gone by, Vanessa noticed that Paul was a great deal more docile and compliant. He didn&#39;t have half the willpower that Chad had. It was probably a result of being born with a silver spoon in his mouth and wanting for nothing as he grew up. Vanessa was familiar with that too, but learning to use magic had a way of teaching you the true value of things—teaching you discipline. Paul had never learned those lessons.<br />
<br />
But one day, Vanessa was ready to put her plan into action. She had enchanted a new bracelet, one that was charmed to bind itself to the wearer&#39;s arm, just like the necklace presently bound to Paul which allowed him to breathe air at the cost of stealing his voice. <br />
<br />
In the meanwhile, Vanessa had also enchanted her mermaid-form pearl necklace so that only she could put it on or remove it. There would be no more nasty surprises if she decided to nap underwater within reach of her new pet merman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul,&quot; she said one day from the edge of the &#39;bedroom&#39; tank, &quot;oh, Paul, I have a surprise for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul swam up to the surface. Vanessa still couldn&#39;t get over the fact that he had the same face that mer-Chad had, thanks to the skin-suit. He didn&#39;t look like the real Paul at all: he looked like the classical mythological depiction of a triton or King Neptune. That, combined with the fact that he couldn&#39;t speak a word, actually went a long way to making Vanessa able to forget that it really was Paul in there. At the very least, she could have a little fun with a merman boy-toy until the day came when she found a *real* merman.<br />
<br />
Paul watched curiously as Vanessa stripped off her swimsuit and then put on hear pearl necklace and the gold bracelet. He watched in fascination as Vanessa&#39;s legs drew together and lengthened out into a fishtail, her feet flattening into the tailfin. He also noticed that the upper half of her ass, and her clit, remained unchanged by the magic, both right above the line where scales started. Paul had not seen Vanessa use any of these items before, and now a mix of emotions were swirling through him. How and why was she doing this? What did she want from him? Was she going to use him for sex?<br />
<br />
As it turned out, that was exactly Vanessa&#39;s motive, and Paul was ambivalent. She swam down to the bottom of the tank and sat atop the giant clamshell that was now Paul&#39;s bed. She patted the spot next to her, and when Paul complied and sat, she took him and started kissing him. But Paul was in no mood to be teased, so he didn&#39;t kiss back, and Vanessa sighed a mouthful of bubbles into the saltwater. <br />
<br />
She would have to use more direct methods of encouraging him.<br />
<br />
So she swam back up to the surface, and Paul followed, and Vanessa reached over to the spot where her bikini had been discarded, along with a new piece of jewelry—a silver bracelet, an improvement over the old design. &quot;Here,&quot; she said, handing the bracelet to Paul, who had surfaced behind her. &quot;Put this on. I *was* going to save it for later, but I suppose I&#39;ve done enough to torture you already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul took the bracelet, but he didn&#39;t put it on. He just stared, questioningly, waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, go on,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;Or don&#39;t you miss having a penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all it took. Paul eagerly slapped the bracelet on, and then beached himself on the poolside and sat up, looking at his groin. Waiting for something to change. Only, nothing did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; said Vanessa, swimming up to where Paul sat. &quot;This version is an improvement over the old model. It gives you a dolphin dick, hidden in a sheath in your scales, like so.&quot; Here, Vanessa opened Paul up and pulled out his newly acquired, oddly-shaped and surprisingly long, tapering cetacean sex-organ. Her merest touch had Paul gasping and panting, willing to do anything for Vanessa—and he&#39;d only been a merman without a dick for a single month.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like that?&quot; smiled the mer-witch. &quot;Why don&#39;t we try… this.&quot; She placed her tits on either side of Paul&#39;s new dick and began to stroke him up and down with them. Paul&#39;s eyes rolled back into his head as Vanessa titfucked him. While she pleasured Paul, she swished her tail to grind her clit up and down against the scales of his tail. Eventually, Paul caught on to Vanessa&#39;s intentions, and he curled his tail around so that the end of his fin could tickle the front of her tail. Vanessa gasped and took Paul into her mouth. &quot;Oh, good boy, Paul,&quot; she said, pleased.<br />
<br />
As they mutually drove each other over the edge, Vanessa wondered how she would break the news to Paul. In the end, she decided to simply let him figure it out.<br />
<br />
What Paul didn&#39;t know was, there was a secondary enchantment on the silver bracelet. Not only did it bond to him permanently just like the necklace; it was charmed so that only Vanessa&#39;s touch could excite his new member. Without Vanessa around, neither another woman nor Paul himself could ever get a proper rise out of his new dolphin-penis. It would make Paul entirely dependent on Vanessa for his sexual satisfaction, just as he already was for food and all of his other worldly needs.<br />
<br />
Vanessa didn&#39;t know for sure how long she&#39;d keep Paul like this, but she did know that until she released him, she was going to enjoy her fantasy. Finally, she had her own merman—just as she&#39;d always imagined.</p>
