<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We made it to Erika's house about 10 minutes later.  It appeared that the other girls were already here, judging by the cars in the driveway.  Erika would finally get her comeuppance now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trisha,&quot; I said, trying to jostle her awake.  She had fallen asleep on the way over.  &quot;Trisha, come on, we're here.&quot;  She just further curled up against me.  There was a smile on her face.  &quot;Oh, fine,&quot; I said.  I opened the door and slid off the seat, doing my best for her to gently fall to the seat.  Once I got out of the car, I took ahold of her body and dragged her out of the car.  Though she was certainly not heavy, her body was a bit unwieldy considering she was asleep.  However, I was able to stand her up against the car and sling her up over my left shoulder.  I then wished that I would be able to carry her and a few parts of Brittany without any problems.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; Mia asked.  She had dutifully exited the car and opened the trunk already.  She was just waiting for us to help her carry the parts in the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's asleep,&quot; I lamented.  &quot;Don't worry, I can grab enough.&quot;  Mia already had Brittany's vacant head in her hands.  I grabbed her arms and torso out of the car, while Mia took the legs.  &quot;When we get inside, make sure you put them gently, gently,&quot; I emphasized, &quot;on a couch somewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; she said.  &quot;You still owe me a fucking, so I wouldn't want to do upset you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a nice attitude to have,&quot; I said, smiling at her.  &quot;Oh, what the hell,&quot; I said, wishing her breasts normal and her pants to reappear.<br />
<br />
She looked down and saw what I had done.  &quot;Thanks, Joe,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;One time deal,&quot; I warned.  We were now at the front door. Since my hands were full, Mia opened the door and we walked right in.  We went into the big living room where I had watched them on Friday night.  The four girls were all sitting on the couches, talking about what had happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;None of that is true,&quot; I heard Erika say as we walked in.  &quot;You guys have always been like this.&quot;  She scoffed as she looked at Claire and said, &quot;Especially you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire looked like she was going to cry.  I was pretty pissed at Erika.  But I had to deal with Trisha first.  I put Brittany's parts on a couch that was not being used.  Mia did the same, and I whispered to her, &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;  She joined the conversation as I walked up the stairs. <br />
<br />
I found what appeared to be a guest room two doors down on the right.  There was a big bed that was fully made inside.  I lay Trisha on top of it and pulled the sheets down underneath her.  She made a soft noise of some kind as I pulled the sheets back over her.  She looked so peaceful under the covers.  More than that, she looked so beautiful.  I bent down towards her face and gave her a soft kiss on the cheek.  She smiled more when I did.  With that, I walked out of the room and closed the door.<br />
<br />
I walked back downstairs and found Erika still arguing with the others, who were insisting that everything they told them I had done was the truth.  &quot;Bullshit,&quot; she said, throwing up her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardly,&quot; I said reentering the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you doing in my house?&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taking over,&quot; I said.  <br />
<br />
She looked flabbergasted.  &quot;Taking over?  Ha!  You must think you're pretty funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, actually,&quot; I smiled and made a wish.  &quot;I know I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See what I me---&quot; she suddenly groaned out in pain as she clutched her stomach.  I wasn't wasting any time with this one.  I wished that my sperm from Friday night would impregnante her.  Now she wouldn't be able to belittle Claire so easily.  It would be nicer to see them on a level playing field.<br />
<br />
Erika's changes happened much quicker than Claire's.  I also did not give her the luxury of removing her clothes first.  Her breast swelled, ripping through her bra and her shirt.  The torn clothes fell to the ground.  Her belly inflated as the baby grew.  The button on her jeans flew off to the air.  The jeans bursted at every seem as the added girth of pregnancy expanded her frame.  Her pants fell off as she writhed in agony.  Claire, showing some sympathy, braced her up so that nothing might harm the child inside her.  In only a minute, Erika was just as pregnant as Claire.  <br />
<br />
Katie and Lindsey helped Erika to a couch.  Claire tried to help as well, but Erika pushed her away.  I sat on the edge of a coffee table in front of her.  When she regained her breath, she asked, &quot;What the fuck did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave you everything you never wanted,&quot; I said.  &quot;To be pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that?&quot; she asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything they've been telling you all afternoon,&quot; I said, &quot;Well guess what?  It's all true.  That's why you're pregnant.  Because I really can do all of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you're fucking lying,&quot; she said.  Not wanting to waste my breath, I wished she would believe me.  I also wished that each of the 6 girls were aware of the changes to all the others, just in case they didn't yet.  With all of the wishes I had made, it was hard to keep track of they knew the truth now.  &quot;Oh, shit,&quot; Erika groaned.  &quot;You aren't lying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right,&quot; I said.  &quot;Now like I said, I gave you everything you never wanted.  I'm also going to give you everything you have wanted.&quot;  I made another wish.  This one was a really good one.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked, anger on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you listened to your messages since you've been home?&quot; I asked, smirking.  <br />
<br />
&quot;There weren't any,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look again,&quot; I assured her. <br />
<br />
She lifted herself from the couch and walked to the telephone in the kitchen.  There was one new message according to the machine.  She looked amazed.  She pressed the button to play the message.  &quot;One new message,&quot; the voice on the machine said.  &quot;Monday, 2:47 P.M.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Erika.&quot;  It was the voice of her father.  &quot;Look, your mother and I have been talking.  We decided it was best to leave you to yourself.&quot;  His voice sounded ashamed of something.  &quot;So we're going to stay out here in San Diego indefinitely.  The house is yours.  We've made all the arrangements for the maid and the utilities and everything else, so you shouldn't have to worry.  If you need something like that, just give us a call.  So you make sure you keep that house in order, and be nice to everyone who's there to help you.  And, Erika, I...&quot; his voice cracked.  &quot;I just want to say I'm sorry.  We'll call you soon.  Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she said.  &quot;They've left me by myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And isn't that what you wanted?&quot; I asked.  &quot;To be alone?  To be free from their 'tyrannical' rule, as you liked to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.  &quot;You did that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I said.  &quot;You think any sane person would leave an 18 year old alone in a house like this?  But I'll tell you that I did it for my own purposes as well.&quot;  I took her by the hand and walked her back into the living room.  She was walking very gingerly.  I wished she would be able to walk a little easier.  I sat her back down on one of the couches.<br />
<br />
&quot;What purposes?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look around you,&quot; I said.  &quot;You and Claire are pregnant, Mia can't lose her temper without losing clothes, Katie's a were-cat, Lindsey's a nude nympho, Trisha's...&quot;  Suddenly I didn't know how to describe Trisha.  &quot;Trisha's a confused, nude nympho, and that pile of plastic over there, believe it or not, is a living person, too.  Oh, and there's too men frozen in time in a back room somewhere in this house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O...K,&quot; Erika said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, complicated shit,&quot; I said.  &quot;Basically I made all of you like this for the sole purpose of revenge.  But unlike seemingly all of you, I have a conscience.  And that conscience has told me that I'm responsible for you all now.  So I have no choice but to oversee the well being of all of you, particularly since you're all dependent on me one way or the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you need the house why?&quot; Erika asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuhhhh,&quot; I groaned.  &quot;Isn't it obvious?  We're all going to live here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked, upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; I said.  &quot;After all, they're all your friends.  And I'm the father of the child you're carrying.  So you're stuck with me, like it or not.  Because I'll follow through with impregnating you, and that means being a father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there's certainly enough room,&quot; she said.  &quot;And I probably would get lonely, so who better than to live with than all of my friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good to know,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about our homes and stuff?&quot; Lindsey asked.<br />
<br />
I smiled at her.  &quot;Naturally, I've already made the wish by which everyone knows you live here, including your parents.&quot;  Actually, I just now made the wish.  &quot;We'll be one, big, happy psuedo-family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one problem, Joe,&quot; Erika said.  &quot;What about that pile of limbs you say is a person?  And these two guys you claim are frozen in a room somewhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't decided what to do with them yet,&quot; I said.  &quot;I'll tell you all in a few hours.  Right now, I have to go check on Trisha.  I'm worried that she's sick,&quot; I lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we do?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The three of you that aren't pregnant can do what you want,&quot; I said.  &quot;Go enjoy the pool or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not warm enough yet,&quot; Erika said.<br />
<br />
I wished that it was warm enough, even if the April air was still cool.  &quot;It is now,&quot; I said.  &quot;As for you two,&quot; referring to Erika and Claire, &quot;why don't you just sit here and watch TV?&quot;  I wished for some snacks to appear, in case they got hungry as I figured they would.  Claire sat next to Erika.  I wished that the other three would go to the pool and that Claire and Erika would talk out their differences.  &quot;I'll be back in a little while to check on you two.  Then we'll set all the house rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
I ran up the stairs, ignoring the objections I heard some of them start to raise.  I knew they would obey my wishes and that I wouldn't have to worry about them.  I had to have a talk with Trisha.</p>
