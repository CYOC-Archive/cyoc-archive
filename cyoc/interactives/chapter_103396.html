<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Princess was not happy that no portal they could create wasn&#39;t strong enough to send herself through. Instead she had to rely other imps she COULD send through to create more of their numbers on the other side and weaken the baby furs enough to allow her army and herself to enter. She&#39;d sent imps who were slavishly devoted to her, and were eager to have more become chaos&#39; adopted daughters, and add to the innocent malice. <br />
<br />
She thought of all it all began, <br />
<br />
[i] Once upon a time, there had been an unexceptional little girl from an unexceptional family, in an unexceptional town, going to an unexceptional school, destine to have a very unexceptional life. <br />
<br />
This little girl had awakened to the sad truth much earlier than any child should have, that dreams and ambition alone were not enough to make those dreams come true. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d also found a book on the ground outside her school&#39;s library. It looked in great condition, but also somehow ancient... odd considering it looked like a &#39;my first reading book!&#39; style of thing given to a struggling first grader. The art was all done in a simplistic and happy style like Bob The Builder. Except the subject matter... wasn&#39;t anything that would get past the PTA or any nearly any sane parent. The title was &#39;______, The Little Imp!&#39; Yes, it was blank. <br />
<br />
For what should have been a thin child&#39;s book, it had far more pages than the binding implied, sixty-six of them. On each page was a little situation the Little Imp found herself in, even the face of the imp in the book was blank. And what the imp said or did at the end was always left to be filled in. <br />
<br />
On a whim, the little girl had written in &#39;Princess&#39; as the name of the character on the title. What she wanted to be, and what she knew she&#39;d never be. <br />
<br />
And low and behold, that was what name was used throughout the book. Was this magic? Naw, had to be nanites or each page was a thin computer screen or something like that. A little horned smilie face appeared on the corner of the cover. <br />
<br />
&#39;Princess says the rules are for _____&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Breaking.&quot; She&#39;d written in, and another smile face appeared.<br />
<br />
&#39;If Princes Found a magic book, she&#39;d use its power most of all to help_____&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Herself.&quot; She wrote, and another smile face appeared. She had to go home soon, and meet with her friend was waiting for her and her brother, but she took the book with her, intending to fill out the other 64 questions there, and she would. Not knowing the prize that awaited the first child to answer all of them &#39;correctly&#39;. [/i]<br />
<br />

<br />
By stories of how high the casle was, Sammy meant by not-friends, not baby furs. Sammy did notice how Bella didn&#39;t need to duck down as they entered. Sammy guessed that was because Sally wanted Bella to come and visit any time she wanted.<br />
<br />
Sammy didn&#39;t think anything of it when the sand castle appeared to be bigger on the inside than the outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;So who were those two?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
Bella explained, &quot;Soldiers who were given orders to &#39;guard&#39; Sally and her friends when they were still human, they&#39;re still guarding her, though not exactly in the same context.&quot; <br />
<br />
There were sets of pretty sculptures of grinning Chinese monkey baby furs. And little alcoves of the cross and the star of David, and many other symbols of faith. Contrary to what he expected, not everything was made of sand. <br />
<br />
The walls had many, MANY crayon drawings directly on them. The crayons went on easily, more like it was traditional wall plaster than the sand it looked like. <br />
<br />
&quot;After meeting the first fur, should we go out and make lots and lots of friends?&quot; Jessy asked innocent, not quite getting what was going on, only that more baby furs was a good thing. <br />
<br />
Bella said. &quot;Remember what Charlotte warned little one? Sorrow, anger, hate, they would only allow more imps to enter the world. If you began actively trying to force humans to become baby furs, it would result in exactly those things, and would make the problem worse. It&#39;s better to allow the baby furs to continue to spread as they have been doing, peacefully.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay,&quot; Jessy said innocently, silently thinking how Bella was sounding like the stuff Sammy had been saying all along their trip. <br />
<br />
Sammy couldn&#39;t help but wonder, how many imp had enter the world when not-friends had gotten so scared and angry when baby furs first appeared? <br />
<br />
Sammy saw one room was full of plush toys of every size and shape.<br />
<br />
Another was an indoor pool that had an underwater path into the ocean, Sammy MIGHT have seen a mermaid baby fur, but he was sure since they&#39;d swam out before he had a chance to get a good luck. But he did notice a bathtub with lion legs next to the pool.  <br />
<br />
Another room was a totally splattered mess of different colors that never seemed to mix into dirty brown, fill of paints of various sorts, another room had cowboy and indian costumes among others, And many more room filled to innocent childhood bliss. Sammy thought this place gave off such glee, it would be a wonder if a not-friend didn&#39;t spontaneous become a friend just from coming here! Or so he&#39;d like to pretend. He didn&#39;t know everything after all. <br />
<br />
Standing perfectly still was a hard clay statue of a Springbok baby fur without a diaper. The statue stared out smiling. Jessy noticed it had the word &#39;truly&#39; (the r was reversed) engraved on the forehead. Jessy reached out like any child and looked with her hands and felt the engraving. The statue giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEHEHEH! That tickles!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! Surprise! I&#39;m Gila The Sprongbok!&quot; Her voice had a slight echo to it. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a great costume!&quot; Jessy giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s no costume.&quot; Kaelyn smiled, her clay stone head moving to look at each of them. &quot;Hi Bella.&quot; She waved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Gila.&quot; Bella replied with familiarity. &quot;These are my new friends, Sammy and Jessy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice meet ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy looked at the symbol on Gila&#39;s forehead. <br />
<br />
&quot;... You&#39;re a golem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. That&#39;s right. I always liked to just sit and think, even before I became friends with everyone. So I guess it makes sense that the first fur made me a magic baby fur who can just sit and think all the time, stand and think, you know what I mean. I should be TOO surprised, I AM Jewish by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... You&#39;re not wearing a diaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really need it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you move all the way?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
Gila responded by doing a little dance. &quot;Can you?&quot; She giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re happy being a golem?&quot; Sammy asked, taking in every detail of her in awe, looking around her this way and that, taking a moment to stare at her stone rear, Gila didn&#39;t really seem to mind, and seemed to be used to it. Her only opening seemed to be her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! I like to watch more than play anyway. And Horsey says I&#39;m to be a surprise if anyone tries to cause trouble.&quot; Gila explained, her clay stone head nodding. &quot;You here to see the First Fur?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; The two baby fur nodded with excitement! <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right through that next door. You gonna be mag-gick-uped? Maybe we can be golem together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wanna became a Tanooki, and they can become statues, but I don&#39;t think I could have fun just sitting and thinking all the time.&quot; Jessy explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if she becomes a Tanooki, I think I&#39;ll become a kitsune, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have fun being a statue all the time either.&quot; Sammy added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what&#39;s fun for you, is what&#39;s fun for you.&quot; Gila nodded. She then went back to her pose of legs straight together with her arms straight at her sides as she stared forward staying perfectly still, not even breathing. <br />
<br />
Sammy guessed he shouldn&#39;t have been surprised, some baby furs would have different ways of having fun. And Sammy guessed that Gila made sense, golems were supposed to be protectors. <br />
<br />
As the baby furs began to feel more and more, well, baby furish as they approached the first fur&#39;s room... two more baby furs came out... Sammy could tell they&#39;d had a magical encounter with the baby fur of their own. <br />
<br />
One was a ... a unicorn colt... at first glance he looked like a white horse... but he had a little silver beard... a tail like a lion&#39;s, and legs like a deer, and there was of course the  glowing spiral horn on his forehead. His eyes seemed to show reflections of his friends. His diaper seemed whiter than white. <br />
<br />
And riding on the horn was a doll sized filly, her fur was extremely light violet. Her eyes were a solid green no whites or centers, and she had two antenna, and a pair of beautiful butterfly wings on her back that shined like stained glass. Her diaper was a shining ruby red. <br />
<br />
&quot;H! I&#39;m Uni The Unicorn!&quot; Waved the colt. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Ametyhist, I mean Amethyst The Fairy!! But you can call me Amethy!&quot; Said the filly fluttering up and flying around the three, leaving a trail of sparkle behind her, giggling to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sammy The Fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Jessy The Raccoon! It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A pleasure to meet you too!&quot; Said Amethyst flying in the face of the three before flying back to Uni. <br />
<br />
The two new comers either knew who Bella was, or the nature of her spell made them not consider her. <br />
<br />
&quot;You two... Sally has gifted you with magic?&quot; Bella asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. I guess so, that&#39;s what fairies have right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what unicorns have!&quot; Uni smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed they do.&quot; Bella said. &quot;I will confess, it gives me a warm feeling seeing fairies and unicorns in this world again. You two are truly a blessing on this world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; The pair giggled.<br />
<br />
Sammy wondered if they were Bestest Friends like he and Jessy were. <br />
<br />
&quot;To help protect Sally from bad things, I think I&#39;ll be teaching baby furs like you how to use their magic to better help protect Sally, would you be interested in that?&quot; Bella asked kneeling down to Uni as Amethy fluttered down to stay at face level. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fun!&quot; Amethy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;If Amethy thinks it&#39;s fun, then I wanna try it too!&quot; Said Uni. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where my house is?&quot; Bella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone in town knows where your house is Granny.&quot; Amethy said. <br />
<br />
Bella startled a bit at this. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see... why don&#39;t you go there and play for a little while? I&#39;ll be back to teach you magic soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; They smiled and nodded, and Amethy rod on top of Uni&#39;s horn as they left the sand castle behind. <br />
<br />
At last... the three entered the bounce room. <br />
<br />
Inside was a pair of bear baby furs, with green diapers, one had a pretty bow on her head, and the other was wearing a bowtie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Told ya this would be fun Mr. and Mrs. General!&quot; Said a cheerful voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is!&quot; The bear pair echoed. <br />
<br />
There were four other baby furs in the room. Their diapers were simple and plain, and they wore no jewelry, or other items that might have made them stand out. One was a brown colt with a black mane, another was a gray bunnie rabbit with red eyes, and a cheetah. The last one... was a baby fur squirrel. On the side of the room was a pink one piece pajama a button opening in the rear. <br />
<br />
They were bouncing up and down in the room, the roof seemed to be super high up, if it had a roof. The walls and floor reacted as if they were made of rubber, or full of springs. The baby furs ricochet off the walls and each other, but didn&#39;t have a bruise or chipped tooth between them, in fact, it seemed to be part of the fun they continued the bounce around the room like pin balls. <br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy emptied themselves in glee from just being in her presence, not that either notice at this point, the enchanted diapers doing their job, and for the fox and raccoon it went as unnoticed as breathing. Merely being in the presence of the first fur caused worries and cares to melt away from their minds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Sally!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GRAMMA!&quot; Sally&#39;s eyes filled with glee at the sight of her and bounced around the room even more intensely before landing perfectly in front of her. She hugged Bella tightly who hugged her back. &quot;I&#39;M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so am I Sally.&quot; Bella whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m happy you&#39;re happy!&quot; Sally grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I think I might be again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YIPPE!&quot; She hugged tighter. The other baby furs landed in front of their new guests. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr and Mrs. General! This is Gramma!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Gramma! I&#39;m Mrs. General.&quot; She Curtsied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice to meet you! And I&#39;m Mr. General!&quot; The boy bear bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you visit Gramma!&quot; Waved Cheetah. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sally&#39;s so happy when you&#39;re here!&quot; Said Bunnie. <br />
<br />
&quot;We were a little scared you wouldn&#39;t get to be happy again.&quot; Admitted Horsey. <br />
<br />
They all gave the old woman a swarm of hugs, that she lovingly returned. <br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy stared in awe at Sally... she was here... they were here... this was her... it was her... this was the First Fur. After everything they&#39;d thought about what they&#39;d say or do when they finally met the first of their race... everything kinda went blank, and they just grinned like fools at the sight of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, where are my manners. Sally? These are two new friends of mine, Sammy The Fox, and Jessy The Raccoon... they&#39;ve traveled a very long way just to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To meet me? Wow!&quot; Sally said like furs coming to meet just her was something super special, then again, all new friends were special. She waddled up to them. &quot;Hi... I&#39;m Sally! Nice to meetcha!&quot; She shook their hands. <br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy looked at each other and grinned wider. The First Baby Fur, WAS SHAKING THEIR HANDS! <br />
<br />
Jessy practically exploded. &quot;OHMYGOSHOHMYGOSH!ITSSOGREATTOMEETYOU!I&#39;MJESSYBUTYOUKNOWTHATALREADY THISISSAMMYBUTYOUKNOWTHATALREADY! CANYOUMAKEMEATANOOKISOICANTALKTOANIMALS ANDSAMMYAKITSUNESOHECANBEWITHME????!!! UH, PLEASE?&quot;</p>
