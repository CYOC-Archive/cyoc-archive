<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next class was English, which neither Jen nor Claire disliked, but on this day the study would be about literature, which was the most annoying part for them. Jen spit out a pill right at the beginning of the class but the teacher had nothing with her to mix with, which left them with no idea how to make her take the pill. What helped them was that Mrs. Watson stopped a bit of spreading and put her hand on her throat and then said &quot;I have a little irritation in my throat. Does anyone have a peppermint tablet that I can take to continue the class?&quot; They took this as a chance and offered the pill saying it was a peppermint tablet. Mrs Watson took the pill without question and started, thanked and then continued the lesson.<br />
<br />
In the end Jen and Claire were disappointed because they expected to see the transformation and the final form of their teacher but failed, because Mrs. Watson simply disappeared. They saw the clothes that their teacher was floating in the air and could hear her talking, which made them sure that Mrs. Watson had just become invisible. After that the class went on normally. Then the bell rang, indicating that class was over and it was time for lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe that Mrs. Watson was just invisible.&quot; Claire said as they left the classroom<br />
<br />
&quot;And even. I expected it to turn into something more extreme.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
On the way to the cafeteria they were stopped by Sarah, a student who was part of the school&#39;s female swim team. &quot;Jen and Claire, would you like to have lunch with me in a private place?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I forgot to tell you. Sarah is a lesbian and has been hitting on me lately.&quot; Claire whispered to Jen<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are we going to do? Shall we accept the invitation to have lunch with her?&quot; Jen asked<br />
<br />
Before Claire answered they felt someone grab their ass. They looked back but saw no one, so they heard Mrs. Watson&#39;s voice saying &quot;Accept her invitation, I will go with you.&quot; Jen and Claire didn&#39;t quite understand what their teacher wanted, but they imagined it would be a good thing, which made their neck-shaft pulse. As they had seen before even though she was invisible her clothes were not, which meant that she was naked there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we accepted the invitation.&quot; Claire said, which made Sarah very happy. The conjoined girls were guided by the lesbian girl with Mrs. Watson caressing their ass, not letting them forget about her presence. On the way to wherever they were going Jen spit out another pill and took it with her hand, Sarah realized that she was holding it and thought she was offering it to her, so she just took it from her hand and took the pill. Immediately the girl&#39;s clothes disappeared and her whole body turned brown, which Jen and Claire soon realized that Sarah&#39;s entire body had turned into chocolate. The lesbian girl had also grown a cock that dangled freely between her legs.<br />
<br />
When they arrived behind the sports gym they found a cloth that Sarah had already laid out there in advance, where she asked the conjoined cock-girls to sit down. As soon as they sat down, they felt Mrs. Watson begin to stroke their shaft-necks making them hard and unable to eat anything in this condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really excited just having lunch with me? This is great, but you will not be able to eat this way. I will help you.&quot; Sarah said and put her partially hard cock in Claire&#39;s mouth, which she accepted and started to suck. Jen was jealous and wanted one in her mouth too, and her wish was granted when she felt a tip touching her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; Jen asked trying to get the object and not being able to see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my dick, you will take care of it.&quot; Mrs. Watson said, putting her invisible cock in Jen&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
The double blowjob was going well but was interrupted when Claire accidentally bit Sarah&#39;s cock, tearing it off. &quot; I&#39;m sorry Sarah, I didn&#39;t want to rip your dick off. Let&#39;s go to the infirmary soon.&quot; Claire said to Sarah. Mrs. Watson also took her dick out of Jen&#39;s mouth observing the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it didn&#39;t even hurt and it can be resolved easily.&quot; Sarah said, so she took a bottle of milk from her bag and started drinking. To their surprise as the chocolate girl drank milk, a brand new stick grew in place of what was pulled out until everything was back to &#39;normal&#39;. &quot;We will avoid accidents now. Let me fill your mouth down there.&quot; Sarah said and the girls understood, so they took off their clothes and invited the lesbian girl to put her brand-new chocolate stick in their pussy, which she did without delay. Soon after they felt the presence of the invisible woman behind them, when she started to fuck their ass as if it were perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
Sarah noticed the second stick that entered the joint girls, but she thought it was strange for a moment because she didn&#39;t see anyone else there, but she soon had no doubt who was also there when Mrs. Watson said &quot;Ahhh, this is very good. Good thing you guys study at this school, they are one of the few that I can get through all 15 inches of my dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their little orgy continued for a few more minutes until they all came. Jen and Claire doing what they could not to cover the sheet allowing her to get fucked on the lawn nearby.<br />
<br />
Once satisfied, they all ate together and talking, they learned that Mrs. Watson always walked around with her cock out, because it was too big to be comfortable inside her clothes and obviously nobody could see it.<br />
<br />
After lunch they shared the chocolate stick that Claire had pulled out before Sarah and ate it for dessert.</p>
