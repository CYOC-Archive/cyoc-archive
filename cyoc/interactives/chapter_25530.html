<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She looked at her new stats once more ...<br />
<br />
Human - Woman - 5'2&quot; - 110 - 29 3/4 Years - Very Curly Blonde 24in - 32A-22-33 - 22 inseam - Body status: -Fit and Toned -cute and sexy<br />
<br />
Then decided &quot;Why not? I can always change it later.&quot; A bit more typing and she got ...<br />
<br />
Human - Woman - 5'11&quot; - 140 - 29 3/4 Years - Very Curly Blonde 36in - 42D-24-36 - 40 inseam - Body status: -Fit and Toned -supermodel/goddess<br />
<br />
She looked in the mirror - and saw that she was magnificent. Tall and gorgeous.<br />
<br />
Susan went to the box in the back of her closet where she put all the clothes that she bought but would never wear out of embarassment - the slutty sexy kicky clothes every woman wants to wear but few do unless they're complete sluts - or goddesses. And she had to use the Chronivac to tinker with her clothing because they wouldn't fit.<br />
<br />
The tiny red satin thong and red demi-cup bra that barely kept her breasts under control, the black ultra-micro-mini spandex skirt, the the see-through blouse that hid nothing and was kept unbuttoned to her navel, the fishnet stockings and red garters, the spike stilletto heels that added another six inches to her heigth - she was a wet dream and she knew it. And for the first time in her adult life, Susan reveled in her womanhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;To hell with being picked up,&quot; she decided. &quot;I'm going to a bar and ignoring everyone until I decide which one I want. Teach those bastard men what it feels like to be someone's 'mercy fuck' and dumped in the middle of a date for a tramp.&quot;<br />
<br />
She went to Killer's - the hottest club in town - and was let in at the door without anyone stopping her. She strutted as if she owned the place, and from all the stares she did. She sat at the bar and four men and a woman immediately bought her drinks. She ignored those drinks and bought her own cocktail, scanning the crowd and frowning at men who tried to talk to her.<br />
<br />
Then she saw him. A skinny boy - obviously he had snuck in here - with glasses and the look that says 'I'm a helpless high-school nerd'. His friend had on clothes a decade out of date and the over-groomed look that says 'I am a high-school loser trying to be a Big Man and look impressive'.<br />
<br />
Perfect - she could kill several birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
Strutting up to them, the 'Big Man' went from being an imitation of smooth to completely tongue-tied. She put her hand on the nerd's shoulder and asked, &quot;Are you old enough to be here?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did your friend talk you into this?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a name, honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I - eek! I'm Horace, ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How sweet.&quot; She decided not to use her real name. &quot;I'm ... Daphne. I don't like this place. Want to leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
Horace nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; the other guy demanded suddenly. &quot;How am I supposed to get home? We came in your car!&quot;<br />
<br />
She fixed him with a cold stare. &quot;Who cares? I got what I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
She led the boy out of the place to the disbelieving stares of the men, all wondering what the boy had that they didn't.<br />
<br />
As they got into Horace's old wreck of a car, they saw his buddy being tossed out. They didn't pay it any attention as they drove off.<br />
<br />
She noticed the boy's white knuckles and deer-in-headlights expression. She caressed his shoulders. &quot;Nervous, Horace?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eek! I mean - uh - I -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK,&quot; she said soothingly. Inside she rejoiced. Heaven alone knew how many men had made her feel completely out of her depth. Her sense of her own power was a stronger drug than heroin. She got a good look at his face. &quot;How old are you really, Horace? I know you and your friend can't possibly be eighteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eep! I'm - uh - fifteen, ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her blood raced. God she was being wicked! &quot;There's a parking lot over there, Horace. Pull in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horace managed to park without hitting anything, but it was a near thing. She decided to take pity on him and give him a thrill.<br />
<br />
She got out of the car and went over to his side, then pulled him out (she figured he was about 5'6&quot; - making him almost a foot shorter than she was in her heels) and walked over to the front of the car, leading him like a puppy. She bent down and kissed him as hotly as she could. He yelped into her mouth in shock, then kissed back in sloppy fashion.<br />
<br />
She sat on the hood of the car, her legs wrapping around him, and told him, &quot;Pull my thong aside.&quot;<br />
<br />
He obeyed, feeling her wetness. Owning this boy was the biggest thrill of her life, and she was flowing. She undid his pants and took out his dick, a decent size of about 5 to 6 inches, and hot and throbbing. She guided it into her, gasping a bit as it penetrated into her pussy. Horace cried out and immediately shot his load into her.<br />
<br />
She gripped him around the waist. &quot;Don't pull out! Don't you dare pull out!&quot; she commanded. He stayed immobile as she lay back against the hood of the car and opened her blouse and unded the clasp on her bra. He was mesmerized by her breasts and watched her squeeze them and the nipples grow huge and sensetive.<br />
<br />
Under her command, he leaned forward and sucked and played with her tits and she felt him enlarge inside her. He fucked her hard and long and when she came, he moaned and came, too.<br />
<br />
She reluctantly let him out of her, then got on her bra and blouse and ordered him to go to his place.<br />
<br />
&quot;But - Daphne,&quot; he whined. &quot;MY folks don't know I wen out -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush,&quot; she said, touching her finger to his lip. &quot;You'll take me home and sex me in your own bed. Or you won't ever see me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trembling, Horace took Susan - or rather 'Daphne' - home with him, arriving at almost midnight. She snuck into his bedroom window with him, and they spent the next eight hours having every kind of sex they could imagine. Horace's tongue cleaned her ass and pussy even as his cock filled them with sperm. She got five more loads of cum out of his fifteen-year-old balls, and he got maybe three times that many cums out of her. They didn't sleep a wink.<br />
<br />
When Horace's alarm went off, he almost panicked, but his marathon sex with Susan/Daphne had drained his energy. Instead, he apologized profusely and went to shower and get ready for school.<br />
<br />
Susan/Daphne giggled to herself. She had NEVER had a night like that! And he practically worshipped her! She now knew what had been missing from her life before - power! Here and now, she ruled and dominated. And she LIKED it!<br />
<br />
She knew it would be easy to do better than Horace, but she didn't want to. He was the one who showed her what it meant to be a Woman - or rather, a Goddess. She decided to keep him.<br />
<br />
She joined him in the shower and had him scrub her clean, then allowed him to empty his balls into her pussy one more time on the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
They were just finishing up when a pounding came on the door. &quot;HEY!&quot; a little girl's voice cried. &quot;STOP JERKING OFF OR I'LL TELL MA! I GOTTA USE THE BATHROOM TOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damnit, Chelsea!&quot; Horace complained as he humped hard and fast. &quot;I'm busy! Go away!&quot;<br />
<br />
Impulsively, Susan/Daphne said, &quot;And he's not jerking off!&quot;<br />
<br />
A shriek came and the sound of feet, with the cry of &quot;MA! HORACE HAS A GIRL IN THE BATHROOM!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god,&quot; Horace moaned, cumming inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, my pet,&quot; she said, stroking his hair. &quot;Let's get dressed and let Daphne handle everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got dressed and Horace went first, allowing his mother to gasp in shock at the apparition that was Susan/Daphne.<br />
<br />
Horace's mother was a moderately attractive woman in her mid-30's, with a black-haired little girl of maybe ten years (Chelsea, she figured) peeking in open-mouthed awe.<br />
<br />
Susan/Daphne took Horace's hand and led him into the living room. Horace's father came out of the dining room and gazed at Daphne in her outfit and her beauty.<br />
<br />
She turned and shook Horace's parents hands and said, &quot;I must thank you for letting me stay the night. And for raising such a wonderful son. He is a love god, and I have never been so sexually fulfilled in my life. I'll be back tonight and maybe we'll talk some more.&quot; Taking Horace's hand, she said, &quot;Drop me off at the club so I can get my car. I'll come for you tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horace almost floated to the car, and kissed her deeply as he lfeft her in the club parking lot. Driving home, she laughed in delight. She loved what she had done to Horace - made him HER property, defied his parents' rights, and that was the beginning.<br />
<br />
Stopping on the way, she spent every penny she had to get an appropriate wardrobe for her new body. One with a bit more elegance and class. At Victoria's Secret, they offered her a job as a model, which she accepted.<br />
<br />
At home, she packed a few suitcases - and the Chronovac. She was going to make a few changes to Horace's household to make it an appropriate dwelling for a Love Goddess such as herself.</p>
