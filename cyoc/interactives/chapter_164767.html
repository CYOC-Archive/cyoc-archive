<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tucker looked at the stuff in front of him. Locke had said the height pills would keep his proportions in tact. So if he added a bit of muscle now, then the height pills should just add more to keep him at the same level as he got taller. Or at least that&#39;s how Tucker thought it would work.<br />
<br />
He picked up the tub of muscle growth powder, turning it over to read the instructions. &quot;Half a teaspoon dissolved in water will add one pound of muscle. Do not take more than 10 teaspoons of powder in a a 24 hour period.&quot; Now he definitely wanted to do this before the height pills, less waiting time. He got up and walked into the kitchen, grabbing a large glass of water and a measuring spoon. Walking around naked was definitely a new experience with that long floppy cock between his legs.<br />
<br />
He returned to his living room and opened the powder. It was white and had no smell. He measured out a teaspoon and poured it into his glass of water. It dissolved almost instantly. Four more teaspoons followed. &quot;That&#39;d be... 10 pounds.&quot; Tucker murmured to himself, looking at the water which was still perfectly clear.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his chin, he thought for a moment. &quot;Fuck it.&quot; He said and added another five up to the max ten. They still all completely dissolved into the water. He picked it up and sniffed at the glass. Nothing. Tipping it back and drinking it still tasted like plain old tap water. He chugged every last drop and set the glass back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I just..&quot; Tucker cut off as he felt a clenching in his stomach. &quot;Oh fuck..&quot;<br />
<br />
It started in his shoulders and chest, he had to shift the position of his arms as his delts suddenly puffed outwards, his chest plumped up with new muscle, the hair on his chest spreading out a bit as it suddenly had more surface area to cover, the two pectorals flat and hard on his once featureless chest. His biceps and triceps grew next, a couple veins popping to the surface as new muscle grew under them, then down to his forearms. He felt his hand&#39;s grip on his stomach grow stronger by the second.<br />
<br />
His already flat stomach, suddenly developed a defined six pack, the hair on his stomach following the mid line between the cobblestone like muscles. He felt his ass swell a bit behind him as the growth moved down into his legs, thighs and calves expanding and forcing him to change the way he was sitting. He even felt his neck and back shifting beneath his skin.<br />
<br />
Almost as soon as it began the tense feeling left his body. He was up like a rocket and running towards a mirror. He even felt heavier moving through his apartment, but he also felt full of a.. power he hadn&#39;t felt before, as if every movement and motion was just easier. He came to a stop at his closet mirror and looked himself up and down. The change was astonishing. Just like Locke had said he looked like a gym regular rather than an athlete or a bodybuilder, but it was amazing how much twenty pounds added to him. Then again, he had barely been breaking a hundred pounds before, he was almost a fifth of his body weight heavier now.. and most of it muscle.<br />
<br />
He struck a couple of muscle poses in the mirror and laughed. Hair, muscle, and a cock that swung halfway down to his knees. If you didn&#39;t know he was so short, he looked like a young man on his way to being a muscle bear. Now to test his theory.<br />
<br />
He had a bottle of pills waiting for him. Without even hesitating he went to get another glass of water and returned to his living room. He swigged down the pills two at a time, eager to get on with it. What he didn&#39;t expect was that this one would hurt a little. A fire pouring through his bones as they stretched out. He had never really had a growth spurt as a kid, but he heard from his friends that did that it hurt, like something inside was pulling them apart. This felt like that but condensed down to a few minutes. Every bone in his body was growing bigger. Longer arms and legs, broader shoulders and chest to match. Bigger feet and hands. Even his skull seemed to throb.<br />
<br />
Luckily, his gambit seemed to have paid off though, as he didn&#39;t lose any of his gained muscle tone in the growth, that seemed to grow with him, staying exactly in proportion to how it was when he was shorter. He lay down on the couch gritting his teeth against the pain. Not even really able to pay attention to what was going on. Though when it subsided, it felt like a cold wave passing through his body.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was with his head on one armrest, his knees bent over the other. He quickly shot to his feet and had a moment of vertigo. He reached out and braced himself on the wall. Everything looked different. IT was like the weird sensation of standing on a step stool, even though his feet were firmly on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap..&quot; He blinked. Was his voice a bit deeper? &quot;Testing.. testing..&quot; Just a little.<br />
<br />
While his muscles had grown with his new height, leaving him that same fit, gym body he had before, though he probably gained another forty to fifty pounds in his growth spurt overall, his cock didn&#39;t get any bigger. That was actually something of a relief as it was already big enough. It was the same monster, but now it just looked more appropriate on his larger body.<br />
<br />
He was exhausted, the changes had taken a lot out of him, but not enough that he didn&#39;t put a new blade on his razor and shave down before going to bed. Almost as soon as his hit the mattress he was out.</p>
