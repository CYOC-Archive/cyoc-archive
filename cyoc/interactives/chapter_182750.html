<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know what,&quot; he told Eric, &quot;I&#39;m not gonna put you in that awkward position. You can keep it until after you get back from your trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s mouth dropped. &quot;Are you serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am. What would your friends think if you got caught at the wrong moment?&quot; He grinned. &quot;Nothing wrong with showing off a little, but don&#39;t do anything too risky ... okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I already tell you you&#39;re the best?&quot; Eric&#39;s eyes lit up and he hugged his big brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, but I&#39;ll take it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise I&#39;ll be careful.&quot; Eric nodded. &quot;I better finish packing. Oh, um,&quot; he blushed, &quot;do you maybe have any old underwear that might fit me? Mine are so tight that it feels like they&#39;re crushing my balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rummaging around in his spare dresser through clothes from when he was younger, Ethan produced a couple of pairs of boxers from when he was closer to Eric&#39;s age. His brother thanked him and took them, a spring in his step as he went back to his room.<br />
<br />
To Ethan&#39;s suprise, his responsive little dick was stiffening in his pants. &quot;Did that conversation really make me hard again?&quot; Ethan wondered. It was almost impossible to tell from just looking, the material barely tenting out at all. He kinda wanted to touch it again, but once was enough for one night. &quot;I hope I made the right decision,&quot; he mumbled to himself. &quot;Just gotta make it to Thursday.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The next morning, Eric departed on his school trip.<br />
<br />
The drive took several hours on the bus. They arrived after midday and then the rest of the afternoon until dinner was spent in class groups exploring their destination. Finally they returned to the hotel, and everyone was assigned a room partner. Thankfully, Eric was paired with one of his friends, a boy named Joshua. Like most of Eric&#39;s classmates, Josh was more physically mature, though not by much -- he was still kinda skinny and on the shorter side of average. They got on well though, and Eric was happy to have a roomie he actually liked.<br />
<br />
The gym class incident also helped with breaking the ice, and he and Josh talked easily, joking and watching TV until the lights-out time.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s underwear was also perfect. Around his hips and butt it was comfortably loose, almost too much -- Ethan had been older than Eric currently was when he wore these hand-me-downs -- but when it came to his package, it was snug and nearly form-fitting. Eric enjoyed the cut of it, and he made sure to walk about their room wearing them in front of Josh as often as he could justify, without it being weird. The sneaky curious glances his friend gave were thrilling, and it was something he found exciting and began to revel in somewhat. Over the next couple of days, he got plenty of covert attention from other students and surprised stares from a few random strangers in public.<br />
<br />
On class tours, at the museum, aquarium and the other venues they went to -- the reaction was the same and Eric loved it all. He had also chosen tighter pants to emphasise his bulge, and the way the material hugged his crotch was mesmerising, and satisfying. Even using the bathroom was more fun -- he found peeing with a larger dick was easier, and a confidence booster in its own right. He even deliberately did it at public urinals a couple of times next to older guys, earning him some shocked looks and double takes. Nothing too dangerous of course, he had promised Ethan that he wouldn&#39;t be reckless.<br />
<br />
Still, Eric was having a great time. The only challenge was managing his hung cock&#39;s need to get hard. He had gotten better at controlling his boners since the swap, but with no opportunity for alone time to cure it, the problem began to get worse. Morning wood was also a discovery that week on Monday. The same evening, he was able to brush the insistent penis away, and with some effort again on the following day. By Wednesday afternoon, his erections had become more frequent and difficult to hide, and once back at the hotel for the final evening, Eric was starting to feel a little desperate.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t sure about making it ANOTHER night without some kind of public scene happening due to his body not being able to handle the overflow of all the teenage horniness going on.<br />
<br />
He needed to jerk off badly, but he wasn&#39;t sure how to manage it without being seen or heard somehow.<br />
<br />
Josh was fun to hang out with, but he was also a bit too talkative and attentive, and nosy enough to notice if something was going on. The chance of a mishap and rumours spreading were too great for Eric to be careless.<br />
<br />
Trying to think of something, Eric excused himself to their room&#39;s bathroom not long before sleep time, and sat down on the toilet. He opened his pants and let the monster free. Uncaged it immediately stiffened and became big and hard, springing up, seeming enormous on his scrawny young body. Bending a little to examine it, he wondered with frustration how he could fix it. The bathroom walls were kinda thin and he couldn&#39;t take too long or it&#39;d be suspicious, so he had to be careful.<br />
<br />
Stroking up and down the thick shaft, he watched precum ooze from the head. He didn&#39;t want to get caught! If only there were some easy way -- it was so close, he could almost smell it- ...<br />
<br />
Wait!<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Was it possible?<br />
<br />
Leaning further, he stuck out his tongue and flicked it down<br />
<br />
It swept over the tip, sending tingles through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
For once, it seemed like being short and slender was a big plus. Now determined, he let out his breath, hunched over, and bent down as close as he could get. With a lot less distance between his head and his groin, and a lot more length to work with, Eric&#39;s lips closed the gap and slid over his large erection. The hot wet smoothness of his mouth was like magic, and he managed to get about halfway along it before he reached the limit of his flexibility. He couldn&#39;t believe he was doing this, but he quickly got over his surprise and began to eagerly -- but quietly -- suck his swollen teenaged cock.<br />
<br />
It only took a minute, his innocent boyish senses unaware of how good it was going to feel receiving a blowjob. Eric&#39;s brain was flooded with dopey fuzzy sexy thoughts, his hardon loving the attention so much it tried to thicken and lengthen even more, becoming like steel and trying to push into his throat in an attempt to choke him. He had little experience with stamina and no need to make it last, so as soon as the rising pleasure crossed the mark, he felt it spasm in his mouth and it was all happening. Eric&#39;s eyes went wide as the fireworks began, not having thought that far ahead, and the cannon began to fire into his mouth.<br />
<br />
He flushed red, realising exactly what he was doing, his suckling lips wrapped around his dick as he swallowed mouthful after mouthful of cum.<br />
<br />
Finally, after more than half a dozen healthy squirts, his softening oversized cock slipped out, he caught his breath and sat up. His back was mildly uncomfortable from the strain of bending, but that was it. Eric grabbed a couple squares of toilet paper, wiped himself off, stood, pulled up and fastened his pants, and flushed the paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was awesome,&quot; he thought as he emerged to a clueless Josh, who was boredly lying on his bed and seemed none the wiser that Eric had just blown himself. &quot;Wonder if Ethan has done that often, I bet it would be awesome if it was a girl doing it. I guess I&#39;m too young for that, but ... I mean, I wasn&#39;t gonna swallow it, and it didn&#39;t leave a mess, and ... there&#39;s probably a better way to do it to myself. Maybe ... Ethan will let me keep it a little longer so ... I can practice sucking myself a bit more with his cock?&quot;</p>
