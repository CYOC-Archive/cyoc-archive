<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright... so... every-&quot;<br />
&quot;Holy fuck dude, are you still on the phone? I just got dressed while you were thinking up a dare and &#39;transformation.&#39; Can you just do everyone a favor and forget about this curse bullshit?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha- I thought you hanged up!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhh... apparently not. Just threw my phone on my bed. Whatever, I&#39;ll just-&quot;<br />
&quot;WAIT. You&#39;re gonna wanna hear this, or else you&#39;ll- you&#39;ll turn into a twink!&quot;<br />
. . .<br />
&quot;Wow. Didn&#39;t think you were actually a fa-&quot;<br />
&quot;Calling me a slur will also turn you into a twink! I-In fact, everyone in the world will become a horny twink! You&#39;ll also forget the-&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually get help, you fag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake proceeded to hang up for real this time and go downstairs for breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;-the entire transformation! Wait! Dammit... Wait, oh no. Nonononono NO!&quot;<br />
Kyle hit the steering wheel of his car and put his head on his arms. He had accidentally made the entire human race a feminine gay species. Not that he was *that* upset; after all, his original idea was the same just that he was a sexy stud, but him getting even smaller and looking less manly was gonna be hard. He at least hoped that he would be &quot;manly&quot; enough for this new world.<br />
<br />
Jake had made it downstairs and saw his Dad, Mom, and Sister. Ronald was making sausages for them, Charlene was getting dressed up for the snowstorm that the news anchor was talking about, and Ella was texting her boyfriend. Kyle- knowledgeable on all archetypes and stereotypes -would have quickly called each person a jock, bear, MILF, and popular bitch. 18 year-old Jake&#39;s muscles had made word around school, and were the subject of a lot of conversations with the girls. Cooking, the one thing that Martha didn&#39;t have to do for the Stone&#39;s, was large-in-part due to 42 year-old Ronald&#39;s pride in cuisine and taste in food; his hairy gut showed this all too well. 40 year-old Charlene&#39;s organization and kindness made her a... &quot;favorite&quot; amongst Jake&#39;s __former__ friends. 17 year-old Ella was captain of the cheerleaders at school and was dating the head football player, Mike Baker. Soon though, all of them will fall under the same trope, as will everyone else.<br />
Jake had sat down, feeling a bit more cushioning in the seat. He looked down, but didn&#39;t notice anything off. He soon ignored it and waited for breakfast.<br />
&quot;Jeez, you&#39;d think that having a boyfriend would get you less dick pics. Guess not,&quot; Ella tossed her phone in part of a weekly ritual of hers. Charlene went to console her harassed daughter before giving her a kiss on the head. Jake, again, thought something might be up. Either his Mom&#39;s DD&#39;s shrinking or his sister&#39;s reaction. Mom always had DD&#39;s though, so it must be his sister kissing their mom back...<br />
Jake didn&#39;t really care all that much though, so he just rolled his eyes and gazed somewhere else. That somewhere else ended up being his Dad. Jake stared at him for some time, not because he was impatient for breakfast- well, not just that -but because something about him was slightly pulling his attention towards him. He couldn&#39;t tell what it was however, so he started to look over him.<br />
(Legs, butt, gut, arms, head, hair.  Mmm, should probably check again and closer.  Strong calves, big thighs, fat ass, shaved stomach, chubby arms, feminine face, shoulder-length hair...  One more time.  Thick thighs, sweet cheeks, tiny waist, cute arms, juicy chest, adorable face...)<br />
&quot;Hey Dad, did you do something with your hair?&quot; asked the otter-built teen.<br />
&quot;Huh? With my... Oh yeah! I thought&#39;d it be nice to put it in a tie. It looks good, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
(Hmph, yeah. Good for tugging~)<br />
<br />
Kyle got out of his car and felt himself up. He knew that there were better ways to see how much he&#39;s changed, but this was not only quicker, but touching himself in public was always a dream he had. The basic white tank top and blue jacket were now up to his chest, showing of his chubby tummy to all of the new sexy men to glance at. His jeans now became short shorts that fitted more like a denim speedo with how much his butt hiked it up. Oh boy was his ass filling out. It&#39;d probably rival most girls in the old world, but sadly not any boys in the new world. He zipped down his fly to get to his little bubble of a bulge and saw the 4 inches he always had. He thought about what this could mean; if penis sizes didn&#39;t change, then that means somewhere was a man with a fat ass and a long 8 inches. The mere thought nearly brought Kyle to orgasm, before calming down.<br />
...Actually, maybe that dream was the new reality talking. Whatever, he needed to find the person that Transformed or Dared him and find out how to fix this situation. He passed by Mr. Northwill, who was jacking off his 2 inches and twisting his right nipple from an obvious &quot;blindspot&quot; from his truck. He had heard rumors that most of the girls in his science class had to do gross and perverted things in order to pass; he wondered how that will transform in this reality.<br />
He entered from the parking entrance and promptly got a slap on the ass. He turned around and spotted the 2 culprits. Baek-Ya &quot;Yagi&quot; Agiru and Tony Marsh; two important members of the football team (Kyle never did pay attention to sports). Unlike everyone he&#39;s seen since the call, all these guys were wearing were a stretched out thong. Both of them had 5 inches on them, which confused Kyle because he *definitely* remembered them being 7 and 9.<br />
&quot;Daaamn Yagi, looks like this little fatty wanted to show off to school,&quot; said the black otter, who was still a foot above Kyle. Yagi himself was between the two in both muscles and height, but definitely leaned closer to Tony. &quot;Hey, didn&#39;t you hear him? Either put that back in your pants or else we&#39;ll put it in our asses!&quot;<br />
It was then that Kyle realized that noticed that he didn&#39;t zip his fly back up and showed his cock off to the world. He tried to fold his hard-on back in before Tony tightly grabbed the meat twig.<br />
&quot;Actually, I skipped breakfast this morning. How about we just take what you&#39;re giving?&quot; Tony gave Kyle a quick tug, squirting some pre on the ground.</p>
