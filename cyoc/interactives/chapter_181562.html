<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The first few paragraphs are the same but when the teammates show up, I take the story in a different direction. Sorry for repeating the first few paragraphs.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad loaded Chad into his car. Brad&#39;s car was so small that it was an awkward fit. Chad&#39;s right foot rested on the dashboard while his left foot stuck out the passenger window. Whenever Brad looked through his rear view mirror he saw the underside of Chad&#39;s penis. When Chad was stood up, his penis looked like it hung loosely but with Chad laying on his side, the penis looked like it curved out. Also, Chad&#39;s tight muscular ass left a wide gap between the two cheeks. It was hard for Brad to not notice while Chad was in that position.<br />
<br />
Brad managed to take Chad home with him to his dorm room. It was a small place but big enough for his three other roommates. They were also science geeks like himself. At first they protested keeping a naked Chad in the place because it would hurt their relations with the ladies so they insisted that Chad be kept clothed. But after a while, they realized they didn&#39;t have relations to threaten in the first place. Then Brad came home to find David practicing his medical skills on a naked Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if Chad is okay with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said he doesn&#39;t feel pain. He shouldn&#39;t mind. Besides, he&#39;s holding a symbol of medicine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just be careful. Remember he is aware of everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
From then on, Chad was kept as a naked statue. The guys found themselves slightly more popular as Chad&#39;s jock friends and their fangirls would drop by to visit Chad.<br />
<br />
One day, Chad&#39;s teammates went looking for Brad. &quot;We want Chad back. He&#39;s missed at many events.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he can&#39;t play sports as a statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s still one of the best runner&#39;s on the team. We&#39;re having a party and we want Chad there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, when do you want Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if we wait until the game. We&#39;d like to parade Chad on our shoulders like a mascot for the cheering crowd before you unfreeze him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the details of the plan were worked out, Brad went home. He noticed some dirt on Chad so he got a wet cloth to wipe Chad down. That&#39;s when he discovered dried cum in the gap between Chad&#39;s ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Chad was pissed. He&#39;d been fucked as a statue and didn&#39;t even know the name of who did it. It was one of Brad&#39;s roommates, the one with the scraggly beard, but Chad never caught a name.<br />
<br />
Chad felt good as a statue despite the helplessness. He could do nothing but wait for other&#39;s to move him about but waves of pleasure kept washing over Chad as if he was meant to be a statue. He was almost tempted to give in and sink into the identity of being a statue and no longer human at all.<br />
<br />
Chad appreciated Brad washing the dried cum out of his ass. He felt closer to Brad as a statue than he ever had as an athlete and he liked being closer to Brad. Brad could polish Chad anytime.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s teammates though were rougher. It was a good thing that Chad was nearly invulnerable because they banged him against walls, floors and ceilings constantly.<br />
<br />
They had set Chad up to greet all the ticket buyers as they bought their tickets. Several people greeted Chad, some by giving his penis a good stroke. Although Chad felt okay about Brad touching him, Chad wasn&#39;t so sure he wanted people he hardly knew taking advantage of his exposure.<br />
<br />
Then when the game started, Chad&#39;s teammates got him and carried him in front of them as they took to the field. It was the largest crowd to see Chad naked so far.<br />
<br />
Then Chad was left near the refreshment stand to greet any customers. One of them dumped a slushy on Chad&#39;s cock. By the time the game was over, Chad was covered in red and yellow.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s team won so they took Chad into the lockerroom to celebrate. They all got drunk and poured champaign on Chad. Unfortunately, he couldn&#39;t drink any of it.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s teammates got so drunk that they got a little randy. Several of them fucked Chad&#39;s ass. Chad&#39;s lips were open just enough that a few cock&#39;s explored Chad&#39;s mouth as well.<br />
<br />
They got so drunk that they staggered out dragging Chad with them. Then they dropped Chad near a dumpster and walked away forgetting all about him.<br />
<br />
Chad lay there for hours until some stranger found Chad and took Chad home. The stranger used Chad like a sex doll too. Then the stranger sold Chad to a department store which shipped him several miles to be set up in the display window.<br />
<br />
Chad was worried. He was getting further away from people he knew. These strangers wouldn&#39;t know that he was a real person. For all they knew, he was just a statue of mercury and wouldn&#39;t care about being taken advantage of. Chad longed to go back to Brad&#39;s care.</p>
