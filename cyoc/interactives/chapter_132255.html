<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Outside in the mall, he cast a hasty glance down at the bodysuit. The horn of the purple unicorn pressing into his side, Dylan shifted it and still feeling frustrated about his winnings, he wondered what he should do with them. The plush he thought he could give away to the first kid he saw, but the garment he thought was a bit more tricky to dispose of. Thinking it would likely raise a lot of questions as to why he had such a thing, Dylan thought, &quot;Well, I ain&#39;t taking it home,&quot; as he scanned the crowded mall.<br />
<br />
Not seeing any kids, only elderly power-walkers and middle-aged shoppers, Dylan huffed in agitation. Picking a direction, he started to wander the mall. Whilst he did this, he scanned the crowds, both inside and outside the stores, toying with the idea of leaving the body suit in one of shops that specialised in children&#39;s clothing. He&#39;d never really paid any attention to the shops that sold clothes, as most of what he own was bought by his mom and what he did buy, or request, he usually got from one of the local department stores, so he was at a loss as to what stores sold clothing. Shifting the plush, which had begun to slip, he tightened his grip on the bodysuit and considered that maybe he should try one of the directories and heading up an escalator, he peered at the stores.<br />
<br />
When it became clear he had no idea what shops sold what, knowing only the stores on the ground floor that sold video games, comics and a couple that specialised in sports memorabilia, he headed back down. Recalling there was directory in the food court, and figuring he could also get lunch while he was there, Dylan began making his way through the crowd. Passing a store called The Children&#39;s Place, he stopped. Thinking, &quot;It&#39;s way too obvious,&quot; he wished the front of the store had some sort of display and instead pulled open the door and peeked inside.<br />
<br />
A store roughly the size of a department store greeted him and seeing the tables and racks full of clothes, Dylan glanced hastily about. Not wanting to draw the attention of some nosy greeter or floor attendant, thinking that the closest garments did look like kid&#39;s clothes, he stepped inside. Wondering where he could ditch the bodysuit, considering that maybe he might leave the plush as well, Dylan decided the best place to leave the bodysuit was either with the shirts or with the underwear. Unsure where he could find either, he shifted the plush, grimaced, &quot;Typical layout nonsense. Can&#39;t find nothing,&quot; and began to wander, hoping to be able to get rid of his winnings as soon as possible and that he didn&#39;t run into a clerk.<br />
<br />
Whilst he started down one aisle, having chosen it because it looked like it was full of girl&#39;s clothes, Dylan peered at the articles of clothing and after a moment, reached out ran a hand over a soft dress. Thinking, &quot;That looks so pretty,&quot; he realized what he thought and blushing, he hurried to the end and over into an open section of tables.<br />
<br />
Disturbed by what he&#39;d thought, unsure why he&#39;d did what he did and where the notion that a dress could be pretty, he idly scanned the tables, searching for some place to dump the bodysuit. Stepping over to a table that had the torso section of a mannequin wearing a blue jean jacket set up in the middle, Dylan started to turn away, but stopped. Looking down, staring at the pair of two-tone blue jeans he was holding, he found himself at a loss as to when he&#39;d picked them up and why. Glancing quickly about, seeing a nearby table that held exactly the same thing he was holding, he took a step over to it, intending to return the pants back to where he&#39;d picked them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; he asked himself and blinking slowly, he reasoned, &quot;They would look cute with the bodysuit,&quot; he stopped. Feeling confused, having never once wanted to wear girl&#39;s clothing, his mind asserting that what he was holding wouldn&#39;t fit him, Dylan muttered, &quot;What the hell is the matter with me,&quot; as he peered down at the articles of clothing.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, and horror, he was for reasons he&#39;d couldn&#39;t understand holding more things. In addition to the bodysuit and pants Dylan found himself holding a jean jacket that had patches of butterflies, flowers and unicorns sewn on, a pair of white and pink canvas high-tops, a pink flower ribbon with a silver rhinestone embellishment and a pair of socks. At a loss as to when he&#39;d picked the other things, disturbed that he thought the things looked cute, and that he knew they would look good together, he looked up and found himself staring at the changing rooms. Muttering, &quot;How the hell,&quot; he slowly turned around and peered out at the store, trying to sort of how he&#39;d gotten clear onto the other side and when and where he&#39;d gotten the other items.<br />
<br />
No answer coming, he thought he should drop everything and run. &quot;Or at least try and find where the go and put them back,&quot; he tried to make himself believe was a proper thing to do. Turning back to the dressing room, he found he instead wanted desperately to try on the his outfit and reaching out for the door handle, he whispered, &quot;What the hell. It&#39;s not my outfit, nor would the stuff fit,&quot; and as watching from a far off distance, he grasped the knob, twisted it and pulled open the door.<br />
<br />
His mind still screaming that what he was doing was nuts, Dylan stepped into the changing room and as the door swung shut behind him, he set the stuff he was carrying onto the bench. Staring at it, knowing it wouldn&#39;t fit, he picked up each item, noted the lack of security tags, and examined the size tags. Seeing everything was size XS, except for the shoes, which he didn&#39;t understand which of the three sizes he was supposed to be reading, Dylan tossed everything back onto the bench and thought, &quot;This is crazy. This is nuts. This is insane. What if someone walks in on me,&quot; and reaching out, he locked the door.<br />
<br />
Quickly turning to face the bench, he stared in apprehension. He knew that the clothes wouldn&#39;t fit, but at the same time he could see the harm in trying them on. Perplexed at this, reminding himself that he was dude and that he had no interest in wearing girl&#39;s clothes, he started to reach for the door handle and instead kicked off his shoes and socks. His jacket going next, which he hung up on the back of the door, covering the mirror in the process, Dylan began frantically tearing off his shirt, pant and underwear, all of which ended up in a pile on his shoes. Standing naked in the changing room, trying to convince himself to put back on his clothes, Dylan eventually broke down and thinking, &quot;What the hell. Might as well prove none of this garbage fits,&quot; and reaching for the bodysuit, he pulled it on over his head, finding at he did so that it actually covered his torso like a tight shirt and that it draped down far enough to be snapped in place.<br />
<br />
Confused by this, he fiddled with the snaps a bit and after a moment, after deciding to tuck his penis and testicles between his legs, though not sure why he felt the need to do so, he finally got the snaps to click. Looking down, thinking the thing looked ridiculous, not liking that he couldn&#39;t see the familiar bulge of his boy parts, Dylan reached for the jeans and pulled them. After button them, he stared a moment at what he was wearing, thinking it was perverted and hating how much he actually looked like a girl, plus how easily the stuff fit, he thought, &quot;Okay, fine. Now I should take this stuff off,&quot; but considering the silvery, glittery unicorn printed on the front of the bodysuit, which looked like it could easily be a tight t-shirt, Dylan reached for the socks, pulled them on, them slipped his feet into the shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is impossible,&quot; he muttered as he pulled on the jacket, adjusted the pink flower in his hair and running a hand down his body, Dylan mumbled, &quot;But I do look pretty,&quot; then stopped when he noticed something off about his crotch.<br />
<br />
For some reason, he found it looked too much like a girl&#39;s front. And when he ran his hand over his groin, he found it didn&#39;t feel right. Slipping his hand down the pants, he paused a moment before thrusting it between his legs. Feeling only the soft cotton fabric of the bodysuit, alarmed that he could even feel his own penis and testicles, he shifted a moment before finally getting is hand past the snaps. Finding nothing tucked back, he nearly screamed, &quot;Holy shit,&quot; and instead yanked his hand out of his pants. Fumbled with the button on the front of the jean, finding he needed to not only see, but to remove the clothes, he stopped when he heard the knob moving.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at it, telling himself, &quot;It&#39;s okay. Whoever it is can&#39;t get in,&quot; Dylan was about to call out that the room was occupied when, to his horror, the door handle turned and the door started to open.</p>
