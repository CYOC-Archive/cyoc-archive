<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You did very well&quot; Ty said and they both laughed it off.<br />
<br />
Both of them stared at the dark sky. Ty sitting on a rock with Buck lying on the ground. Ty closed his eyes and let the cold breeze caress him on the cheeks. Buck did the same. In a few while, Buck stood up and galloped on place in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I wanna experience my human form more.&quot; He looked at Ty. &quot;Shall we go back inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty followed Buck back in the huge cabin and once again got a good view of how Buck shifted into his towering humane body. Buck loved that feeling, growing to this form in a matter of seconds. It was somehow arousing to his part. He moved to a mirror near the wooden sofa Ty had made for him and took a good look at his own body.<br />
<br />
Buck being 6&#39;2&quot; and having a body that may look similar to a manly lumberjack, he still have a youthful look. With his new humane thinking, he thought he somehow resembles a newly graduated college jock, but much stronger, wiser and smarter. He have a few hairs on his lip and chin which were nicely shaved. He sports a short messy undercut. His gaze lowered down to his torso. His chest muscles prominent and matches his lumberjack-ish look well. His patted his stomach to feel his 6 pack abs. Lowering down, he got a feel of his cock in his pants. He smiled, satisfied with the size albeit being soft.<br />
<br />
Smiling to himself, he saw Ty in the mirror, looking around the house. Buck took a deep breathe. It wasn&#39;t certain what he wanted to express. It was a mixture of satisfaction and dismay. Seeing Ty makes him happy, yet cautious of himself. His smile slowly disappears when he realize his pants starting to get a little tight on his crotch. That&#39;s when he realize things he never thought of before.<br />
<br />
Was he attracted to Ty? Even if he try to deny that be thinking that maybe it&#39;s just because he&#39;s happy to be with him, he still cannot get rid the fact that he just had a hard on for Ty.<br />
<br />
Buck tried to get out of his thoughts by exploring his house more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Buck&quot; Ty called. This surprised Buck and he quickly turned around to Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hey... What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting jumpy all of the sudden?&quot; Ty laughed at his friend. &quot;Anyway, I wanted to ask if you wanna check the rooms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sure...&quot; Buck replied and they both went upstairs with Ty leading.<br />
<br />
Ty checked every door from Buck&#39;s bedroom. Every room have different usage. Next to Buck&#39;s room was a guestroom. It was for Ty if he ever wants to hang out overnight. Beside that was a gym, but instead of having metal equipment, all of them are made up of wood and stone. On the other door was a library but with limited books. Most books in the shelves were thrown away or lost in the forest. Finally, the last door leads to a bathroom which again is made up of stone and wood. There&#39;s a working shower head which was a wooden tube connected to the river a few feet away the house.<br />
<br />
As they roam around the house, Buck can&#39;t get rid his eyes from Ty&#39;s body. Buck wanted so much to fondle with Ty&#39;s hair and to caress his back. He would found himself gulping own hard whenever he get a glimpse of Ty&#39;s face. Buck then would try to softly slap himself a few times.<br />
<br />
Ty then turned around to Buck, noticing his behavior. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Buck replied.<br />
<br />
Ty noticed how heavy Buck is feeling so he tried to ask him once again, this time, Ty grabbed Buck&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;No please... I should go to my room for a while.&quot; Buck walked into his room, softly closing his door. He rushed to his bed and jumped on the cushion.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be...&quot; Buck said to himself. &quot;He&#39;s a fucking minor, and I&#39;m like 26.&quot;<br />
<br />
He laid on his back and stared down the bulge on his pants. He sighed and removed the button to let his cock out. Buck had a good look on his cock. It was about 6 and a half inches. His balls are heavy and he can feel them churn already. With that, he took off his flannel, leaving him only with his pants on. His left hand explored his muscular torso while his right hand grabbed his hard on. Images on Ty being naked appeared in his mind which made him moan loud.<br />
<br />
He smacked his head with his right hand and frowned. &quot;I shouldnt... Ty&#39;s my friend and... He&#39;s too young for me, to begin with.&quot;. Still it took a lot of effort for Buck to masturbate without thinking of Ty.<br />
<br />
Outside his room, Ty can hear Buck&#39;s deep voice as he talk to himself. He can hear Buck moan and whisper his name. Surprised, his brain couldn&#39;t process anything well.<br />
<br />
Could it be that Buck... like me? He thought. He didn&#39;t know what to do and how to react. Ty started to develop mixed feelings.</p>
