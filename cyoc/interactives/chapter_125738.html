<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment Craig woke up, he couldn&#39;t move a single muscle. He was lying in bed on his side, in fetal position, with his pillow underneath his head. All of his limbs seemed to still be asleep, at least from the neck down. All he could do was twitch his fingers and toes, in hopes of returning any feeling of his body.<br />
<br />
He was in a bit of panic, but he was brought back to his senses with a computer humming and typing in the background, coming from the room next to him. If he needed help, he could just ask his girlfriend Liz. He knew he didn&#39;t though, she&#39;d probably just played with him.<br />
<br />
After a bit of waiting, feeling returned throughout his body. As soon as he could move again, he looked down at himself.<br />
<br />
His body was still covered by his blanket, but from the slender arms above it and the lumps closest to him, he could already assume what his girlfriend had done. Throwing away the covers, he was met with 90% of Liz, and what a sight it was.<br />
<br />
From a first person point of view, if a woman of course, everything would look totally fine. It was the beautiful curves, almost representing an hourglass figure, that expressed typical feminine looks as you&#39;d see them on the cover of a Playboy. Completely naked. Boobs, tits and pubes were in full display.<br />
<br />
As the foreign but familiar hands touched his chin however, Craig grinned at the though of how he had to look at the moment. He stood up from the bed, and turned to the mirror in his room.<br />
<br />
Now all was visible. Posing as if a supermodel, the tender hands were softly pressed on the hips. Craig had set both feet against each other, only to see with glee, how the thighs touched each other, with just small gap open in between. He was posing with C-cup breasts, the skin on this body had a healthy tan. It made him remember the moment he saw his girlfriend naked for the first time. An even hotter sight, of course, with the head and stuff. From the side you could also see a glimpse of the plump ass Craig&#39;s girlfriend possessed, but which was, at this moment, under his control, attached to his head.<br />
<br />
Just checking if he could still fix himself if necessary, he gently tugged his finger. And to confirm it, with an audible pop, it came off.<br />
<br />
Quickly putting on a robe which lied on the end of the bed, Craig walked to the room of the faint humming and typing. Opening the door he saw his girlfriend, in all her glory, albeit her head attached to his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Liz.&quot; Craig began. &quot;Morning.&quot; Was the blunt answer he got. She didn&#39;t even look up to the screen. She was busy with... something, probably a project for the company she worked for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lost track of time again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t bother you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig walked back to the bedroom again, opening Liz&#39;s closet.<br />
<br />
Craig selected one of those sexy tops Liz bought, the ones that turned him on when she wore those. Now was the chance after all. He picked some normal trousers out of the closet, not really interested in skirts or dresses, and went for a fancy bra just to please Liz. Also Craig himself didn&#39;t want to be bothered by those... oddly sensitive nipples to be constantly erect, poking through the top he selected.<br />
<br />
He still kept on the robe for now, the reattachment process is really fatiguing for the body, and he was completely covered with, so to say, Liz&#39;s body sweat.<br />
<br />
Craig opened the bathroom door, threw the clothes on the floor, and turned on the shower. He forgot both a towel and underwear, so he went back to the bedroom to get both. A towel was easy to find, as Liz had already lied one down next to the robe he did grab. For underwear he thought of choosing one of Liz&#39;s panties. He searched for something that matched the bra, only to finally find out where Liz hid that dildo he&#39;d given her as a present at their anniversary. As a joke, of course.<br />
<br />
Not thinking a second time, as turned on as he was to be in possession of his girlfriend&#39;s body, Craig forgot about matching panties and grabbed a random one, but also decided to borrow that large sex toy for a couple of minutes, or however long it would take.<br />
<br />
Throwing of the robe and letting to of the underwear, Craig threw himself into the shower. The water had warmed up already.<br />
<br />
*Craig 1st person*<br />
<br />
A few minutes had passed, and all I had done was a bit of touching my boobs and tweaking my nipples. It was pleasuring enough to turn me on, yes. It also felt nice and soft, as expected, but it was far from what I expected having a nice time in Liz&#39;s body was about. I brought my attention to the awfully realistic looking cock, which was lying lifelessly erect on the shower floor. I hadn&#39;t dared to play with it yet, it still had a bit of a gay tint to it, but it was in a completely different situation right now. I and Liz had switched bodies and body parts before, even to this extent, but never had we actually had sex in this state yet, in those 6 months together. She mostly used my body when I had a free day in my schedule, like today. In my body, for at least she claims, she can concentrate better. It had to do something with hormones and its effect on the way she was thinking. I agree with her for that part. I do think differently in this body, the thick, 7 inch dildo in my right hand proves that.<br />
<br />
The back end of the dildo had a large suction cup attached to it, quite convenient, I thought.<br />
<br />
Letting the shower stream flow, I pushed the object to the ground, and marveled at the sight of it pointing to the ceiling from the ground up. I slowly went down on my knees.<br />
<br />
Once on my knees, I bent them, aiming my pussy on the dildo.<br />
<br />
As I bent them, I got ready for impact.<br />
<br />
I felt the skin around my pussy stretched out painfully at first, with how slow I went with it. Slowly however, the skin gave way a bit quicker, until the skin went around it, and I was rewarded with pretty jolts of pleasure. It was only on the surface still, I searched for the outline of in which it fit, until I found out of a pleasure point that blew my mind.<br />
<br />
The clit! Of course! <br />
<br />
I lost track of what I was doing. I jolted up at that moment, as the pleasures of this minuscule organ surprised me big time, and relaxed, sitting down on my knees again. Of course I had forgotten about a for its size gigantic object lying right underneath my cunt. My new vaginal muscles contracted around it even before I found out what actually happened. It was as if I was having a small orgasm already. Thrusting the wet rod in and out, I could sense a big one coming. I subconsciously throbbed my newfound clit faster and faster, while it felt like i went deeper and deeper. At certain times, the dildo couldn&#39;t even reach further into me, it was these moments that gave most, and best pleasure, the G-spot. I picked up the pace, my breathing stocked, my heart rate gradually went up, I rubbed my clit just a bit harder, and as that monstrous cock hit that specific G-spot again, I went into bliss.<br />
<br />
As to what should always happen to a man after a 15-second orgasm, I regained my rational senses, and quickly came to realize what I had actually done. I still felt a faint pressure from inside me, and these odd new muscles were still contracted. I ignored it, and just washed myself clean and put on the clothes.<br />
<br />
Within five minutes, I found myself outside of the bathroom again. My eyes were locked into Liz&#39;s. She was seemingly angry, yet still had a impressing, perhaps mischievous smile on her face. I looked down in defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Craig,&quot; she started, she was reaching for my pants and panties, and pulled them down, &quot;I actually never felt the need to use that thing you&#39;re holding.&quot; My eyes shot up. She reached for my, well, her clit, and rubbed it for a couple of seconds. Another release washed over me, I went into another, this time smaller orgasm, legs contracting still. Juices squirted out of the glory hole, the sticky liquid got all over my legs, but also the once clean pants and the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clean it up,&quot; Liz continued. &quot;You might as well wash yourself a second time, I&#39;ve got an appointment where you need to go to.&quot;<br />
<br />
I returned to my senses for a second time that day. &quot;Whereto?&quot;<br />
<br />
She chuckled and looked at me as she sat down on her office chair again. &quot;I wanted to go for a massage today, but I&#39;m busy. I might as well let you visit them. Consider it a &#39;punishment&#39;!&quot;</p>
