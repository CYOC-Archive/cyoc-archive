<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie paced as she looked sadly at her friends. Katie had gone with Jack and the others leaving her by herself. She worried now about what was happening. “We screwed up huh dad?”<br />
<br />
Merlin could nod give a sad nod as he gazed out where the others had been only moments before. He knew of the other witches existence but his knowledge of Lilith and Circe was limited. Morgan LeFay was his area of expertise, meaning that he had little to give his daughter as far as advise. As he was about to answer Baba Yaga materialized in front of the group, a smirk etched on the ancient crones face. Kellie and the others glared at the ancient witch as she smiled at Merlin.<br />
<br />
“Well now Merlin,” she smirked. “It seems like you’ve been rather busy of the last couple hundred years.”<br />
<br />
“What do you want,” Kellie grumbled as her and her friends now angrily glared at her. Baba giggled almost girlishl, shaking her head as she gazed at the ancient wizard. “Seriously Merlin,” she chuckled. “Is that anyway to treat an ex girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
“Wha,” Kellie gaped before gawking at her father. “Dad you want to explain that one?”<br />
<br />
Merlin sighed, rubbing his eyes as he looked sheepishly at his daughter. “It’s a long story,” he groaned. “Well come on dad,” Kellie exclaimed wildly. “You want to explain how you ended up dating an evil old witch.”<br />
<br />
“Two things child,” Baba stated. “First, not evil. If you actually paid attention to legend you would see I’ve willingly helped both sides. On more than one occasion I’ve assisted the hero in his journey. Think of me as a neutral party. Secondly, yes I may look old right now but when me and your father were together I most certainly didn’t look like this.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gave the drone an odd look as she smiled at them. As she waved her hand Kellie watched as the drone glowed with a faintly white light around her form. Kellie watched as the crones body began to youthen. The deep wrinkles in her face began to smooth as her body began to straighten. Slowly but surely theynwatched as Baba Yaga body began to regain it strength returning to the prime of her life. The crones hair went from white to a shimmering dark black while her breasts regained their perkiness, going from saggy to full and cartoonishlynlarge DD cups. As the crones regression completed Kellie was astounded. Baba Yaga was now a young woman in her early 30s. The woman possessed flawless alabaster skin with glowing and full midnight black hair that day ended to the middle of her back. Babas figure also had improved dramatically, the crones formerly lumpy appearance was now hourglass in shape with large breasts, a thin waist and hips that would be the envy of any woman. Even the crones milky white eyes had regained their previous color, going from a milky white to a piercing blue. Kellie and the others stood in stunned silence as the beauty smiled.<br />
<br />
“I take it your impressed,” she said coyly, her voice dripping with sexual energy. “Merlin was always impressed as well. We made quite the power couple back in the day.”<br />
<br />
“Until you cheated on me with a frost giant,” Merlin grumbled as he narrowed his eyes at his former lover. Baba sighed sadly, hanging her head in embarrassment because of her past indiscretions. “Ugh I know,” she moaned. “Geez how many times do I have to apologize for that. I know I screwed up. But for the millionth time I’ve told you, I drank too much ambrosia in Valhalla that night. I was ripped out of my mind.”<br />
<br />
“Cheating cheating,” Merlin said softly as he narrowed his eyes at Baba Yaga. “Now tell me Baba. Why is it you, Circe, and Lilith have come to this world and begun claiming mortals.”<br />
<br />
“Because of you ya dope,” Baba exclaimed. “I mean seriously, what the hell did you expect after claiming a daughter AND eliminating Morgan like you did? You know how that would of been perceived by the others.”<br />
<br />
“Others,” Kellie asked, slightly confused.<br />
<br />
Merlin sighed as he gazed down at his daughter. “Yes Kellie the others,” he said. “You see, every story you’ve ever heard about wizards or witches or magical beings is true. Theirs a whole community of magical inter dimensional beings out their. Most often we don’t get involved in the mortal world, I’m kind of an exception.”<br />
<br />
“Which is why I fell in love with your old man,” Baba smiled. “Me and him, were kind of the same. Over the millennium we both kind of found ourselves involved in the mortal world, people are just so....interesting.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Kellie said slowly. “But how in the hell did you and my dad get involved with one another then?”<br />
<br />
“It was a different time,” Baba sighed sadly. “The world was more believing in magic and your father and I were still young, Well young by our standards. We would often journey together, have fun, help or harm depending how we felt or how it would affect the world. It was young love at its finest. Til I screwed it up.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Kellie said slowly. “But if you and my dad were an item, and judging by how your talking younstill like him. The why are you helping Lilith and Circe?”<br />
<br />
Baba sighed as she looked at Kellie. “I wouldn’t exactly call what I’m doing helping,” she groaned. “Lilith and Circe have their own agenda and basically pulled me into this. Lilith was so pissed about Morgan that she wanted revenge. You know how she gets Merlin, the whole no one hurts one of our magical sisters thing, that holier that though crap is so annoying, but she she begs for assistance from other magical beings you can’t turn it down.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“So she intends to harm Kellie then,” Merlin grumbled. Baba shook her head as she looked back at her former boyfriend, “No she’s too smart for that,” she answered. “She knows eliminating your child will just cause a magical war that could do some serious damage. Personally I think she’s trying to make an opposite for your daughter. Kind of ying  and yang, to keep things balanced. That and it would help her standing amongst the others if her son were to succeed Morgan LeFay. Lilith isn’t so much concerned with ruling the world as being recognized as powerful. Ruling takes a lot of energy, she would just rather just bathe in her sons accomplishments. Kind of like those pageant moms.”<br />
<br />
“What about Circe then,” Merlin asked. Baba groaned as she now thought of her. “Ugh she’s a pain in the ass,” Baba grumbled. “She wants to be worshipped like a goddess like it’s freaking Ancient Greece. She could give a dam about Liliths plan, she wants followers. She’s useing her powers to turn people into animal hybrids as we speak. If she gets enough of them she could start to believe herself stronger than Lilith and overthrow not only her but her son. Then we really have problems cause you know how those fights go.”<br />
<br />
“How do they go,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“Remember Atlantis,” Merlin grumbled. Kellie shook her head no.<br />
<br />
 “Exactly,” Baba answered. “That’s why I’m just along for the ride on this one. They both know that even with their combined powers trying to take out your dad, your friends, and that other timeline would be an almost impossible task. They both think I’m just a senile old fool and I sure as hell don’t want them knowing that I’m watching. I’m just trying to keep their egos in check so that they don’t blow up a continent if they get in a cat fight.”<br />
<br />
“So why tell us all this then,” Merlin asked.<br />
<br />
“Geez your slow,” Baba sighed. “Look you putz  I still love you. Yeah I know I screwed up but I’ve been living in the mortal world quietly for sometime. I watch and I observe. I’ve seen the good you do. I admire you for that. I know we’re not destined to be together but I always find happiness in watching you help others. I’m trying to give you fair warning so you can be prepared.”<br />
<br />
“Does that mean your going to help us,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“Sorry can’t,” Baba stated. “Jack is the one I have to protect, which means don’t screw around with him. If it ever came down to a fight I will protect him. Mind you I might pull my punches but I know Lilith won’t. She is a mother and she is very protective of her kids, especially him.”<br />
<br />
Baba Yaga now approached, her hips swaying as she gave Merlin a gentle yet passionate kiss on the lips. “You know,” she smirked. “Really did miss you ya old coot. Don’t do anything stupid okay?”<br />
<br />
Merlin could only nod as Baba Yaga once more shifted into her elderly form before vanishing. As she vanished Kellie could only stare at her father in wonder. She had only seen a glimpse of her fathers life and wondered what exactly else he had yet to tell her.</p>
